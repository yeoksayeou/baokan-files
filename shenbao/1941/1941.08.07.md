### Report that the US President Will Meet with the British Prime Minister: Secret Discussions on Important Strategies, with a Focus on How to Support the Soviet Union Against Germany. US Envoy Hopkins Will Also Attend

United Press, London, June 6th: Sources within the British government stated yesterday that Prime Minister Churchill and US Lend-Lease Envoy Hopkins are "together" at an undisclosed location. Observers speculate that the two may be flying to meet with President Roosevelt, who is currently vacationing on the yacht "Potomac" off the US East Coast. According to official statements here, the House of Commons is currently holding a debate on the progress of the war, but Prime Minister Churchill is unable to attend due to "inconvenience." British sources also said that Churchill's absence from the House debate is due to extremely urgent matters related to the war. The "Daily Mail" reported that "three high-ranking British officials," possibly Churchill, or Lord Beaverbrook, will fly to the United States to meet with Roosevelt. Hopkins' whereabouts have been very secretive since returning to England from Moscow, but well-informed British sources say, "You can find Hopkins near the Prime Minister." They refused to suggest where the two are. The US Embassy issued an official statement that Hopkins is "recovering" somewhere in England. As for Prime Minister Churchill's absence from the House debate, it was announced by the Lord Privy Seal and Deputy Leader of the House, Attlee.

Reuters, Washington, June 6th: There was talk here yesterday that Prime Minister Churchill might cross the Atlantic to meet President Roosevelt at sea, but well-informed sources considered it doubtful. At the same time, neither official nor private sources have acknowledged or denied this claim. Everyone is asking where Churchill is, but no one can answer. Yesterday, British Lord Privy Seal Attlee's statement in the House of Commons that the Prime Minister would not participate in the debate on the war was acknowledged by a Washington newspaper as an indication that the British Prime Minister would meet with President Roosevelt at sea, and speculated that US Presidential Envoy Hopkins would also attend. However, Secretary of State Hull was unable to comment on the matter, but said that when he met with the President on Saturday night, he was unaware that the British Prime Minister would be meeting with the President. Many believe that the US President is unlikely to leave the US coast as far as Iceland, and Churchill would find it difficult to travel far beyond Iceland. However, everyone agrees that it would be excellent if the British and American leaders could meet.

United Press, Washington, June 6th: Early this morning, attention here continued to focus intensely on reports from London that Prime Minister Churchill, President Roosevelt, and Hopkins are secretly discussing important strategies in the North Atlantic. If Churchill and Roosevelt have indeed met in person, it must be related to Hopkins' recent visit to the Soviet Union, and to prevent future Japanese advances to the south. At the same time, the conference will also discuss the evolution of the war situation, especially the recent strong resistance of the Soviet Union against Germany and how to support Soviet resistance. Some experts here say that Japan's occupation of Vietnam and the deployment of troops on the Thai border will undoubtedly be discussed by Roosevelt and Churchill, and that due to the difficulty of freezing the existing situation in the Pacific, they may take greater pressure on Japan if necessary.

### Roosevelt Cruises at Sea, Meets with Fleet Commander

Reuters, Washington, June 6th: Official sources from the US presidential yacht stated that after a restful night, the President continued to cruise north at sea, destination yet to be announced. The President, wearing sportswear, enjoys the sea air. When asked about the extent of the cruise, the President replied that there was no fixed location, and daily actions would depend on the weather and fishing conditions. The President sometimes discusses matters with the Commander of the Atlantic Fleet.

United Press, Washington, June 6th: American and foreign officials here yesterday did not speculate on the possibility of President Roosevelt meeting with British Prime Minister Churchill. The Navy Department reminded reporters that the White House and Secretary of the Navy Knox had previously asked reporters not to make all sorts of speculations about the President's current trip. White House Secretary O'Leary said that he had no knowledge of the meeting between the two.

United Press, Miami, June 6th: Newspapers here today published a report from reliable diplomatic sources in Washington stating that on Thursday afternoon, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill held a meeting on a ship in the North Atlantic. The report also stated that British and Canadian sources in Washington said that Roosevelt and Churchill met off the coast of New Brunswick, while another said the meeting took place off the coast of Newfoundland.

United Press, Washington, June 6th: Secretary of State Hull and British Embassy officials yesterday said they were unaware of reports that President Roosevelt would meet with Prime Minister Churchill. Another senior naval official said that if the President had such a meeting planned, the information would be released in the daily radio bulletin at a time deemed appropriate by the President. The yacht "Potomac" on which President Roosevelt is traveling is equipped with machine guns and underwater telegraph cables for protection against mines, making it very suitable for sea travel, but not for long voyages.

### Anti-Japanese Sentiment in Ecuador, South America, Intensifies, Japan Lodges Protest

Reuters, Tokyo, June 6th: Japan has recently issued a note to Ecuador, South America, demanding that it stop anti-Japanese actions and protect Japanese residents. Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said yesterday that Ecuador has recently claimed that several Japanese residents are suspected of espionage and will be deported, believing unfounded rumors that Japanese residents have joined the Peruvian army to make trouble for Ecuador. The Japanese government has lodged a strong protest, but anti-Japanese sentiment is still spreading in Ecuador. The Japanese government believes that this matter can be resolved peacefully soon, but it is currently awaiting Ecuador's official reply.

### McNutt Advocates Joint Stand by China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands to Prevent Japan's Continued Southern Advance

United Press, Washington, June 6th: Former US High Commissioner to the Philippines and current Federal Security Administrator McNutt declared last night that the only way to prevent further Japanese aggression is for China, Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies to take a firm joint stand in the Far East. He has consistently advocated that the United States should adopt a firm Far East policy. In a separate meeting with a United Press reporter, he emphasized that he was speaking as an American citizen, not as a government official. However, it is worth noting that most of the Far East policies he advocates have recently been followed and adopted by the government. He said that Japan will encounter joint action by democratic countries in the Far East. He emphasized that Japan's actions have united its neighbors in the Pacific into an effective anti-Japanese front. He also said, "If an accident occurs in the Pacific, the sixteen million Filipinos will remain completely loyal to the United States. The Philippines is the only paradise in the unhappy East. Filipinos do not want to accept Japanese aggression." He also said that China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands should use their military position. These countries are currently confronting Japan in various ways in the South, and in the North there is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's current national interests are in the same direction as ours. There is currently only one reasonable and successful policy to follow: we should make it clear to Japan that if Japan goes any further, it will inevitably lead to war. I believe that Japan does not want to choose war.

United Press, Tokyo, June 6th: Japanese newspapers today said that the Japan-Vietnam joint defense plan has freed Japan from worries about its rear, and that recent attention has shifted to the Siberian issue. Newspapers also discussed the possibility of the Soviet Union uniting with Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies to encircle Japan.

British Parliamentarians Urge Increased Restraint on Japan

Reuters, London, June 6th: In the House of Commons yesterday, a Liberal parliamentarian, who spoke frankly about the assistance provided by the United States to Britain's blockade against Germany, requested assurance that the economic sanctions imposed in the Far East be consistent, so that Japan cannot obtain oil and other war supplies from British, American, and Dutch East Indies territories. Foreign Secretary Butler replied that discussions with relevant governments are still underway regarding the implementation of the far-reaching financial control measures that have already been promulgated. Undoubtedly, these measures have been put into practice and are not empty words, and their impact on Japan's acquisitions will be quite serious. Labour parliamentarian Noel-Baker said that the best way to prevent war in the Far East is to immediately stop all oil supplies, and this impression should be given to the United States. Butler replied that the US government is familiar with this situation.

### US Appoints Military Attach√© to Australia, Two Heavy Cruisers Refuel in Australia

United Press, Washington, June 6th: Authoritative sources announced yesterday that the United States has appointed Colonel Miles Smith as the new military attach√© to Australia, and Lieutenant O'Connell as his assistant. The two will leave here in two weeks. The United States has sent a naval attach√© to Australia, but this is the first military attach√©.

International News Service, Washington, June 6th: The Navy Department revealed yesterday that two US heavy cruisers are currently refueling in Brisbane, Australia. It is said that the above-mentioned two ships, under the command of Rear Admiral Hepburn, will leave here in a few days. Due to recent reports that the US fleet is heading east, the Navy's news has aroused interest among the general public.

### Dutch Government Resolves Not to Relocate, East Indies Government Statement: Continue to Increase Defense Equipment

Reuters, Batavia, June 6th: The Dutch East Indies government has reiterated in the People's Council that there is no question of the Dutch government relocating. Britain's resistance is now increasing daily. Our belief in the victory of the Allied countries is even greater than before, and London is the best place for the Dutch government to advance its war efforts as the center of the war. As for the situation in the Pacific, it is now appropriate to continue to increase the defense equipment of the Dutch East Indies and increase economic and spiritual self-defense. The ordered war supplies are now arriving in large quantities. Special attention is now being paid to obtaining the latest defense war supplies. The plans for enlightened manufacturing of munitions and explosives have reached a higher stage.

### US Department of Justice Recommends Authorizing Governor of Honolulu

United Press, Washington, June 6th: Reliable sources here said yesterday that the Department of Justice has drafted a bill to be submitted to Congress, granting the Governor of Hawaii the power to deal freely with the activities of citizens in times of emergency, should an incident occur in the Far East. The bill has been submitted to the Army Department for review. Once approved, it will be introduced to Congress by someone in the government who supports the bill.

### Britain and the United States to Make Major Decisions on the Pacific and Aid to the Soviet Union

United Press, London, June 6th: Observers here believed yesterday that future British and American talks will lead to major decisions on the Pacific and aid to the Soviet Union. It is increasingly recognized here that democratic countries' economic sanctions against Japan are too lenient, failing to prevent Japan's southern advance and threat to the Soviet Union. According to reliable estimates from non-British sources, in the past two weeks, the Japanese have sent about 100,000 troops to reinforce the more than 250,000 troops stationed in "Manchukuo." These people are asking each other whether, if democratic countries are so eager to remove the Japanese threat in the South Pacific, they are willing to take strong steps to prevent Japan from attacking the Soviet Union or even forcing the Soviet Union to mobilize a large Red Army in the Far East. Soviet sources believe that the most important assistance that democratic countries can provide to the Soviet Union is to warn Japan not to approach the Soviet Maritime Provinces. Observers recalled that on July 13, Britain and the Soviet Union formally cooperated in fighting Germany. Commentators doubt whether this cooperation can be extended to the Far East. Since democratic countries have agreed to defeat Germany to protect common interests, it can be considered that they will never sit idly by and watch Japan take actions that could distract the Soviet Union's efforts to fight Germany. It is also believed here that unless democratic countries offer the Dutch East Indies a full guarantee of assistance in resisting aggression, it seems excessive to ask the Dutch East Indies to fully join in economic sanctions against Japan. Regarding the more tangible issues related to Britain, it is the extent to which Britain is willing to implement US measures that are beneficial to the Soviet Union.

### Forty Towns in India to Build Air Raid Shelters, Malay Defense Strength Increased, Australia Builds More Than Fifty Ships

Reuters, Simla, June 6th: About forty towns in India, listed as areas vulnerable to attack, will immediately build air raid shelters. The minimum standard of protection is to resist the explosive force and shrapnel of a 500-pound high-explosive bomb dropped from 50 feet away, and the debris from nearby building collapses.

Reuters, Singapore, June 6th: A British troop, including some marines and soldiers, has just arrived here to increase the strength of the Malay defense. This British troop arrived here by ship from a port in northwestern Britain. No accidents occurred. When arriving, Indian troops participated in the escort. Prince Basrah also came here from India to inspect the Indian troops stationed in Malaya. When the troop carrier docked, senior military officers from the sea, land, and air forces came to welcome him, and Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Brooke-Popham even boarded the ship to pay his respects to Prince Basrah.

Reuters, Sydney, June 6th: Australian Army Minister Spender recently released figures revealing the extent of Australia's war effort. It is said that Australia will build more than fifty naval vessels, including minesweepers, patrol boats, and tribal-class destroyers. Since the start of the war, Australian naval personnel have increased three and a half times, and there are still volunteers. There are 5,000 people a year. The strength of the Australian Air Force is equivalent to three army divisions.

Editorial

### The Emergency in the Far East

The Pacific Ocean is turbulent, and the situation in the Far East is showing unprecedented tension. Even though the war in Europe continues on a large scale, its importance cannot be diminished, but the center of gravity of the entire world is undoubtedly falling on the Far East. The notion of subordinating Eastern events to the European war is outdated. At least for now, the events that are sufficient to affect the largest part of the world are not the partial advances and retreats of the Soviet-German war, but the looming but constantly developing crisis in the Pacific. Ten years ago, the sparks of war in the Far East began to destroy the peace and order of the world. Today, in terms of reversing the chaos and rectifying the root causes, we should first thoroughly liquidate the Far East.

In the past two weeks, the events that have occurred in the Far East are almost as significant as the sum of the events that have occurred in this area in the past decade. There are indeed signs that the Tripartite Pact is not being strictly observed in the Far East, but it is not turning to approach the democratic countries. Instead, it is seeking to be unattached and unconstrained, to obtain the greatest freedom of action, and to take absolutely self-interested and unlimited expansion as its ultimate goal. This can be seen in practical measures: internally, it is to step up the mobilization of materials and complete a highly defensive system; externally, it is to plan for both southern and northern advances, while not neglecting the war against China. The collapse of the entire base in Vietnam, the breaking of the balance of power in the Indochinese Peninsula, and the fact that Thailand is isolated and helpless and has to rely on strong support in order to preserve itself - this is a major change that has never occurred in Southeast Asia in half a century; and in Northeast Asia, we see large armies gathering and stepping up deployments, and a new war is about to break out, with its realistic danger perhaps greater than in the South Seas. Which way the southern and northern advances will go is of course not something that anyone can predict, and perhaps we will have to wait for the arrival of favorable opportunities to decide. But in general, it seems that the measures taken in the Indochinese Peninsula may only be for future needs, while the deployments in the Northeast are pregnant with a decisive step. The importance of the South Seas and the coastal provinces of the East Sea may vary from person to person, but at this time when the Sino-US-British-Soviet anti-aggression front is about to be completed, the gain or loss of Vladivostok has the same significance as Singapore. It is also something that the anti-aggression front cannot ignore. And although Singapore is an impregnable fortress, in terms of the offensive strategy in the Western Pacific, it is not as valuable as Vladivostok. This may be the reason why the situation in the Northeast has been more tense than in the South Seas recently.

In democratic countries and even the Soviet Union, they certainly do not want to see the expansion and outbreak of war in the Far East, so as not to distract their attention from the European situation. Therefore, the economic sanctions imposed by Britain and the United States are quite flexible. Although the Soviet Union suffered a loss in the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact, it still hopes that the Neutrality Pact will not follow in its footsteps. On the other hand, in the midst of harshness and arbitrariness, they have not failed to be prudent in their actions. Regarding the retaliation for freezing funds, it is clearly stated that it will be changed according to the attitude of the United States. After the oil embargo was finally implemented, they did not fulfill their previous threats about the oil embargo. Instead, they expressed their willingness to adopt a more moderate policy and stop further aggression, only asking the United States to recognize its position as the leader in East Asia. This condition is certainly not acceptable to the United States, but it may not be a smoke screen released for bargaining. Ogura's article and Wakisugi's return to Japan show the activeness of this attempt. But for these circumstances, rather than considering them as reefs in the future of the anti-aggression movement in the Far East, it is better to regard them as the hesitation of the moment before reaching the final stage, because acts of aggression can often be initiated but cannot be stopped, and stopping at the edge of a cliff can only be expected of great wisdom and courage. If there is still a possibility of saving the Far East crisis, there have been countless opportunities in the past decade, regardless of what was encountered.

### Fierce Fighting Erupts Again in Central Hubei, Japanese Troops Attacking Haoxue are Repelled, Chinese Troops Capturing Haozikou Continue to Advance Westward, More Than Half of the Japanese Troops Encircled in Huangjiachang are Killed or Wounded

Chongqing Military News, (1) Japanese troops attacking China from Jiangjunnao and Erliuguo were reinforced on the morning of the 5th. After the Chinese army resisted desperately, the battle became more fierce. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties, and the Chinese also suffered casualties. Currently, the Chinese and Japanese are still fighting on the line near Baiguoyuan, Zhenlongwangdong, and Caojiabu. (2) The Japanese troops surrounded in Huangjiachang, Zhubaoshan, Guojiachong, Pangjialing, Yangjiawan, and other places were pursued and annihilated separately, with most of them killed or wounded. It will not be difficult to annihilate all of them. (3) The Chinese army near Yichang attacked the Japanese troops in Nanjinguan, a suburb of Yichang, and the highlands east of it on the evening of the 30th of last month, fighting with the Japanese until dawn on the 31st, killing more than 200 Japanese and seizing many spoils. (4) This time, the Japanese army in central Hubei divided into four routes to attack Haoxue. After the strong Chinese troops fought back on separate routes, two routes attacked from the south of Shashi Cenhekou had reached Pengjiachang in Haoxue and were severely attacked by the strong Chinese troops. Unable to hold on, they collapsed to the north, and the Chinese are tracking and pursuing them. One route that attacked Yangjiaqiao from the south of Shashiangjingkou was defeated and retreated to the north. The Chinese took advantage of the victory to recapture Haozikou, and surrounded the remaining Japanese troops in Lujiadian and Jiadian (both east of Hougang) separately. Another route of Japanese troops attacked from the south of Qianjiang, Jiangnan, and was intercepted in the area east of Xiongkoushi. The fierce battle lasted until the 5th. The Japanese suffered heavy losses. (June 6th dispatch)

On the night of the 4th, more than 1,000 troops were added and attacked the Chinese army. The momentum was extremely fierce. This morning, the Chinese army lured the Japanese troops to Pengjiachang, north of Haoxue (south of Haozikou), and ambushed them on the highway. After a bloody battle at 1 pm, the Japanese troops could not hold on and retreated to the north. The Chinese troops are now pursuing them separately to Qianjiangqiao, Huangjiachang, Rangqiao, and other places. There are currently no traces of Japanese troops in Pengjiachang and Xihukou. (May 5th dispatch)

Most of the Japanese Troops Crossing the Xiang River were Annihilated

Changde: The Japanese troops entrenched on the north bank, west of the Shihuasi Jiangkou, opened fire on Liujiagang, a part of Bailizhou, at 5 pm on the 4th.

Changde: A part of the Japanese soldiers crossed the Xiang River on small boats from Yueyang at 4 am on the 5th and landed stealthily on the Louqinwan on the opposite bank. The Chinese army immediately sent a team to surround and attack them. Most of the Japanese troops were annihilated, and the remnants have also been surrounded by the Chinese army and can be completely annihilated. (May 5th dispatch)

By the evening, the Japanese could not hold on and fled. More than 100 Japanese were killed in this battle, and many spoils were seized. (May 5th dispatch)

### London Times Elaborates on the Sino-Japanese Situation: China Able to Weather Economic Difficulties, Japan's Position Increasingly Precarious

London - The "Times" today published an exclusive article discussing the situation in China, stating that the Chinese people feel that Germany's attack on the Soviet Union is beneficial to China, confident in their own ability and the material assistance from other countries (ABC), and are certain to prolong the war for several years. At the same time, it is felt that Japan's position is becoming increasingly precarious. Economic problems have already disrupted it, and there is no certainty of assistance from allies. Although it is eager to act, with hundreds of thousands of troops trapped in China and unable to move freely, what can Japan hope for by provoking conflict with the Soviet Union, Britain, the Netherlands, India, and the United States? The campaign against China has now entered its fifth year, and it has not yet been possible to end the Chinese affair. It wants to befriend Germany, but Germany has already broken faith with the Soviet Union. How can one be sure it will not break faith with the old? It wants to obtain oil from India, but the Dutch are prepared to destroy their oil at any time. Is there anything surprising? The Chinese feel that if they can weather the economic difficulties, they can have a future based on the victory of the Allied nations, because the victory of the Allied nations is a necessary condition for a truly new order. Under this new order, the Chinese can rebuild China, seeking welfare for themselves and not for foreign masters. What China needs most urgently today is the economy. Chairman Chiang has repeatedly stated that the war of resistance and national construction accounts for 30% in military affairs and 70% in the economy. Foreign experts generally believe that Japan's increased efforts to blockade China cannot alone cause China's economic collapse. China's crisis lies within. Many difficulties have naturally arisen during the four years of resistance and national construction. The important test now is the strategy to deal with these difficulties. Although the Chinese authorities are confident in their ability to weather the economic difficulties, they recognize the difficulty of controlling food prices in the inland areas. Although those in Sichuan Province who hoard grain for speculation are severely punished, grain prices have still not been suppressed. When the newly established Ministry of People's Food has made significant progress in the future, it will be able to eliminate some or all of the hidden dangers in the current situation. Foreign experts generally believe that the most serious of China's economic problems is inflation, but it has not yet reached a critical point, such as that experienced by Germany after World War I. However, to avoid future troubles, measures should be taken immediately. If the Chinese show the same determination, resolve, and courage as they have shown in overcoming many difficulties in the past, then future troubles can certainly be eliminated. Although the Chinese are concerned about the future economy, they have greater faith in the political future. Dr. Quo Tai-chi's return to the country to take up the post of Foreign Minister is the most important event. This is not only the case in China, but also related to other ABC countries. Since Foreign Minister Quo took office, his strict policies have placed him at the forefront of Chinese leaders. China's severing of relations with Germany has cleared up Chongqing's position, and the United States has capable ambassadors as representatives. If the relationship between the three ABC countries fails to reach a stage of greater significance, the responsibility does not lie with Foreign Minister Quo. Germany's attack on the Soviet Union is what the Allied nations in China have gained, and what the Axis powers have lost in China. In the past, 30,000 tons of military supplies were exported from the Far East via Siberia every month. Now that this has been cut off, it is a major blow to Germany, and Germany's export trade, which has been increasingly developed on this route, has also suddenly stopped. The impact on Germany is not small. In the future, German merchants in China can hardly hope to restore the superior position they enjoyed in the great Chinese market in the past. (Reuters, 6th)

### Chen Jie Delivers a Speech in Washington

Washington - Our former ambassador to Germany, Chen Jie, delivered a speech last night to Chinese and American people at a banquet held by the United Relief for Chinese War Refugees. He stated that China will continue to serve as a leader against aggression in the Far East, and will cooperate with the United States and Britain to fight for the creation of a peaceful, stable, democratic, and civilized world. After Germany recognized the Nanjing organization, China severed diplomatic relations with Germany. This move has placed China in a position of irreconcilable opposition to the forces of aggression, and it will continue to oppose any appeasement of the Axis powers. Hitler and German military figures all believe that China is one of the countries with the strongest land army in the world, and it is impossible to subdue it to Japan. The German side admires the determination of our Chairman Chiang in the war of resistance and national construction. We are very grateful for the assistance given to China by the democratic countries in the past. In the future, China, Britain, and the United States must be absolutely united. If the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands intensify economic sanctions against Japan, continue to provide large amounts of material assistance to China, and protect the Burma Road, then China will be able to launch a full-scale counter-offensive and quickly defeat Japan.

Remittances from Malaya to Hong Kong are Unrestricted: According to reliable information obtained by the Central News Agency in Singapore, after Hong Kong joins the pound sterling bloc, remittances from Malaya to Hong Kong will be freely remitted from today without official restrictions. It is expected that remittances from overseas Chinese here to China will also resume remittances in the near future. (5th)

Hong Kong - The Hong Kong government authorities announced that Chinese funds in Hong Kong are not included in the list of counterpart deposits. Remittances for use by overseas Chinese will be facilitated as much as possible, and banks and merchants will be specially allowed to purchase necessary food supplies. However, after the implementation of the counterpart deposit order, Chinese businessmen will inevitably suffer considerable difficulties. It is hoped that they will be tolerant. It is also said that remittances from Japanese people in Hong Kong have been completely stopped. (5th, Chang)

### Four Banks Allocate Funds to Reward Production Enterprises

Chongqing - The Economic Conference of the Executive Yuan yesterday resolved that the general offices of the four banks should allocate 60 million yuan each year for the purpose of encouraging various important production enterprises, of which 10 million yuan must be used as circulating funds for various enterprises, and the remainder should be used to purchase important products in order to avoid stimulating their production. This measure was proposed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which in turn was based on the request of the Southwest Industrial Federation. (Havas Agency, 6th)

### Central Daily News Advocates Requisitioning Foreign Exchange Owned by Chinese Citizens to Replenish Legal Tender Reserves

Chongqing - The Central Daily News published an editorial today advocating that after the United States and Britain deposit Chinese funds, the state should requisition all foreign exchange owned by Chinese citizens. The newspaper pointed out that "market men with foreign exchange" have not made a fair contribution to the war of resistance and national construction, and have even been causing trouble in the market and disrupting people's livelihood. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration for the government to compensate for the requisition, which is beneficial to the country and does no harm to individuals, in terms of reason and emotion. Although the government does not need a large amount of foreign exchange now, in order to replenish the legal tender reserves after the war and raise the large amount of funds needed for reconstruction and construction, it should also take this opportunity to generally requisition it. As for the discounted price of the requisitioned foreign exchange, it should be deposited in the bank designated by the foreign exchange owner, and its withdrawal should be restricted in accordance with the regulations on stabilizing finance. After the end of the war in the future, the government should still use compulsory methods to use it as the price for purchasing state-owned enterprises or designated private enterprise stocks. This investment can be guaranteed by the state with principal and interest. (Havas Agency, 6th)

### Members of the Visit to Burma Delegation Met Yesterday

Chongqing - The members of the Chinese Goodwill Mission to Burma met today to finalize the plans for this trip. It is reported that the delegation will fly from Chongqing to Yangon by special plane on August 27. They will stay in Burma for about two weeks. The head of the delegation is Jiang Menglin, the former Minister of Education and current president of Southwest Associated University, and the deputy heads are Zeng Yangfu, the former vice minister of railways, and Miao Yuntai (transliteration), the manager of the Fudian Bank. There are eleven members of the delegation, including Tang Dechen, the director of the English Department of the Central News Agency. It is reported that Tang will conduct preliminary negotiations on establishing a central branch in Yangon during his stay in Burma. (Reuters, 6th)

Retreat is resistance. Accommodation is condemnation, and even then there is no way to change its consistent attempt to expand, let alone today? These circumstances are well known to the major statesmen of the world, so the world does not have to worry too much that the leading figures in defending democracy will fall into the evil path of appeasement. Initiative must be striven for. Loopholes must be blocked. But the overall trend cannot be doubted; under the gradual advance of the aggressors.

It has been rumored in recent days that British Prime Minister Churchill is meeting with US Special Envoy to Britain Hopkins and US President Roosevelt somewhere. If this statement is true, it is believable that what they are discussing must be the problem of the Pacific as the main focus; because the major events in the European situation are only aid to the Soviet Union and counter-offensive, but the latter cannot be achieved overnight, and the former does not need the top authorities of the two countries to discuss it. Only on the response to the Far East, both sides have a greater need to exchange views. Although Britain was the initiator of the appeasement policy in the Far East in the past, the current development in the Far East has seriously threatened the security of the British Empire. On the path of southward advance, Malaya and Singapore are of course the first to bear the brunt, and the northward advance to attack the Soviet Union also indirectly affects Britain's final battle against the Nazis. No matter how the attempt to ease the pressure from the United States proceeds, the British side cannot but strive for the complete removal of these threats, and it is not difficult to imagine that this conversation will inevitably produce concrete and effective results.

Since the era of the Far East began four years ago, it has now reached the stage of extreme prosperity and approaching the final liquidation! After this, perhaps there will be a difficult struggle, but in the end, the arrival of light is inevitable!

### German Troops Launch Fierce New Offensive Along a Wide Front, Claiming to Have Occupied Two Important Strongholds, Elite German Troops in the Northwest Area Are Defeated

TASS, Moscow, 7th - The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report stating that yesterday our army continued to engage in fierce battles with the enemy in Smolensk, Kruston (northwest of Kiev), Bilaya Tserkov (south of Kiev), and the Estonian front. There were no important battles in other areas. Our air force did its best to assist the Red Army in fighting the enemy's mechanized units and inflicted heavy losses on them. As a result of our army's air battles and attacks on enemy airfields on the 4th, 53 enemy planes were shot down, and our side lost 21 planes.

TASS, Moscow, 6th - On the Northwest front (i.e., Finland, Estonia, Leningrad), our army heavily damaged the most elite SS division of the German army (i.e., the German shock troops). The division repeatedly attacked but was repelled, suffering 1,500 casualties and abandoning 60 machine guns and many other military supplies.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 6th - Responsible parties announced last night that the city of Bilaya Tserkov (45 miles south of Kiev) and the city of Holm on the Lovat River (between Smolensk and Leningrad) have fallen into the hands of the German army. Holm has a population of 20,000 and is located on a tributary of the Bug River. The area has always been regarded as one of the Soviet granaries.

International News Agency, Moscow, 6th - The Red Army High Command announced that the Soviet Air Force yesterday launched a full-scale attack along the vast Soviet-German front, annihilating most of the German armored units and infantry. It also stated that victories were won on the Leningrad and Kiev fronts. The Red Army High Command issued a communique at midnight stating that the German 16th Motorized Division attempted to break through the Soviet defense line in the northwest area of the front, but was repelled. It is reported that 1,500 German soldiers were killed or wounded. Soviet military circles believe that although the German army may have broken through 70 miles in the area between Leningrad and Smolensk, this offensive must have stopped. The Soviet communique also stated that the German vanguard in the Kiev and Kruston areas has retreated due to the Soviet counter-offensive. A German infantry regiment was completely disintegrated in this battle. The conclusion of the Soviet communique stated that the Soviet air force bomber groups have heavily damaged the German army, and the German army's offensive power is now weakening.

### Heavy Losses in Manpower and Equipment, German Blitzkrieg Plan Fails

Reuters, Moscow, 6th - The Soviet Army organ "Red Star" commented on the failure of Hitler's blitzkrieg plan yesterday, stating that the war on the vast front has been going on for six weeks. Although the enemy has not been defeated, the failure of Hitler's blitzkrieg plan is already obvious. The three methods proposed by the German army command have been used one by one and have all failed. What are the three methods? That is, (1) concentrating tanks and aircraft, followed by motorized infantry, to strike at a designated point; (2) attempting to advance simultaneously with all its strength in extremely important directions; (3) fighting on the entire front in order to discover points that are easy to attack. The Fascist newspapers are no longer full of praise for the blitzkrieg, and Goebbels has recently said that Germany must make greater sacrifices. This is evidence that the Fascist war machine that is carrying out the blitzkrieg has suffered a major failure. Fascists did not take into account the resistance of the Red Army, or the true nature of the war, or the vastness of the front when calculating the blitzkrieg. The German leaders have great confidence in their air force, but the German air force has not gained a decisive advantage, and the powerful Soviet air force is gradually gaining the upper hand. According to the German plan, the armored army must play an important role in the lightning-fast victory, but the Red Army's fierce counter-attacks often cut off the connection between the Nazi armored army and the infantry, and half of the German troops attacking on both sides were annihilated. Fascist infantry, accustomed to driving straight in behind tanks and aircraft, is now forced to fight alone, proving that their training for long marches is insufficient. The enemy has suffered heavy losses in manpower and equipment. Hitler, who only relies on his omnipotent tanks, is now starting to talk about using rifles. No matter how large the German army is, its number will never be as large as the Red Army. The Soviet side is well aware of the enemy's strength and that its reserves have not been exhausted, but this war has just begun.

### British Military Experts Observe the War Situation, German New Offensive Seeks Weak Points

United Press, London, 6th - Observers here believed yesterday that the purpose of the German army's fierce attack in the Holm area was either to expand the Leningrad front, or to suddenly attack the north side of the Smolensk salient. British military experts believe that the lowlands around Holm and the brambles of the Valdai Hills make it difficult to realize their attempt to advance along the road between Holm and Moscow. The news that the German army claimed to have occupied Bilaya Tserkov was released too late, and experts here have not yet commented on it, but the experts previously believed that the position of this city was very important. If the news reported by the Germans is true, then the fall of this city is a serious blow to the Soviet army's Ukrainian position, because military experts had previously pointed out that if Bilaya Tserkov was occupied by the German army, the railway between Kiev and Odessa would be cut off. However, these experts also said that the fall of this city would not hinder traffic bypassing Kiev to the east. Experts here also believe that the sudden outbreak of war in the Holm area is enough to show that the Germans have not been able to find a team that can take advantage of the situation in the entire Soviet front, including the Kiev part. The northwest front has now expanded to more than 200 miles, which is enough to show that the Germans are still looking around on this long front from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea in the south, in order to find weak points and realize their desire to drive straight in. The views held by people here when observing the German-Soviet war are roughly based on the Soviet communique, because the repeated Soviet communiques indicate that the Soviet army is still effectively encircling and annihilating the attacking German army. British newspapers still attach great importance to the possibility of the German army launching a third general offensive. These experts pointed out that judging from the situation of the Soviet army's transportation of military supplies, especially fuel and oil, the Soviet army's position on the Smolensk and other fronts may now be more advantageous than the German army. Some well-informed experts believe that the German decision-making action must be concentrated in the Holm area, and it is expected that the Soviet army has concentrated a large number of troops there to prepare to meet the enemy.

### Guerrilla Activities Within 300 Miles of the German Front Become More Intense

TASS, Moscow, 6th - The "Truth Daily" published an editorial entitled "Forward Guerrilla Team," stating that guerrilla teams are fighting more resolutely, fiercely, and extensively behind enemy lines. Nazi personnel admit that the war in front is not as easy as it used to be, because guerrilla teams are all over the place within 200 to 300 miles of the German front. The glory of the heroic Soviet patriots behind enemy lines is too numerous to mention. In the cities and villages occupied by the Fascists, the people responded to Stalin's call, rose up to fight a holy war, organized guerrillas, attacked enemy troops behind enemy lines, blew up bridges and railways, destroyed telephone and telegraph lines, and set fire to forests and warehouses. Guerrilla teams pose a permanent threat to the enemy. A guerrilla team in the Belarusian region suddenly attacked the enemy's motorized infantry, killing 100 German soldiers. In another area, a guerrilla team used bottles containing fuel to destroy 18 enemy heavy tanks. Twenty kilometers north of City D, a guerrilla team attacked a large unit of enemy infantry, using machine guns and rifle fire to prevent the enemy from crossing the river. There are many such incidents, too numerous to mention. The first to initiate these struggles were the Belarusian and Ukrainian peasants, because they were the first to bear the brunt of the enemy's abuse. The Belarusian guerrilla teams vow not to lay down their weapons until all the Nazi villains have been driven out of the territory of Belarus.

### German Army Issues Special War Report

Haitong News Agency, Fuhrer Headquarters, 6th - The German Army Command issued Special War Report No. 1 this afternoon, which stated that General Lieb's corps crossed the Daugava River between Daugavpils and Riga, and after clearing the enemy troops in Latvia, it will break through the Stalin defense line along the Soviet border and simultaneously attack the Soviet army in Estonia. General Buch's army, together with General Hopner's armored units, broke through the Soviet army's positions south of Lake Peipus and occupied Ostrov, Pskov, and Plisa. The German army can now attack Leningrad from the north. The German army's left wing advanced towards Narva between Lake Ilmen and Lake Peipus in order to cut off the connection between Lake Peipus and the Gulf of Finland. General Koshler's army occupied the towns of Dubate and Pyllovo in Estonia. The enemy army lost 355 tanks and 655 artillery pieces, and 35,000 people were captured by the German army. General Keller's air force shot down and destroyed 771 enemy aircraft.

Haitong News Agency, Fuhrer Headquarters, 7th - The German Army Command issued Special War Report No. 3 today, which stated that General Bock's corps on the Eastern Front has concluded the Battle of Smolensk and achieved victory. The area, time, and war situation of the battle were unprecedented. The armies under General Kluge, General Strauss, and General Weichs, and the tank corps under General Guderian and General Hoth, heavily damaged the enemy army in fierce battles on all sides, capturing 310,000 people and seizing and destroying 3,205 tanks, 3,120 artillery pieces, and many other war materials. The air force under General Kesselring destroyed 1,098 Soviet aircraft. The details of the battle will be announced in tomorrow's war report.

Haitong News Agency, Fuhrer Headquarters, 6th - The German Army Command issued Special War Report No. 2 today, which stated that General Rundstedt's corps fought against the Soviet army on the southern flank. The armies under General St√ºlpnagel and General Kleist repelled the enemy army after fierce battles and advanced from Berdichev towards Kiev. The German army has penetrated into the rear of the Stalin defense line and can now advance south between the Dniester River and the Dnieper River, cutting off the enemy army's rear lines of communication and implementing a strategic encirclement. The Hungarian and Slovak armies fought alongside the German army and achieved considerable results. At the same time, the Romanian General Antonescu led the German-Romanian allied forces and recovered Bessarabia, and left a division under General Cibourg to cross the Dniester River and advance north to link up with the German army in the north. The German army captured 150,000 people and seized 1,970 tanks and 2,190 artillery pieces. General L√∂rzer's air force assisted in the battle, shooting down and destroying 981 Soviet aircraft.

Haitong News Agency, Fuhrer Headquarters, 6th - The German Army Command issued Special War Report No. 4 today, which stated that the total number of enemy officers and soldiers captured by the German army on the Eastern European battlefield reached 895,000, and the total number of enemy tanks seized and destroyed reached 13,145. In addition, the total number of enemy artillery pieces seized and destroyed reached 10,388, and the number of aircraft reached 9,082. Compared with the statistics announced in the war report on July 11, the number of prisoners has now doubled. At that time, there were 40 prisoners, and the number of enemy aircraft seized and destroyed was 6,233.

### Soviet Union and Norway Restore Diplomatic Relations, Both Sides Exchange Documents in London Yesterday, Soviet-Southern Treaty Still Valid

Reuters, London, 6th - The Soviet Union and Norway have restored diplomatic relations. Yesterday, the Norwegian Foreign Minister and the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, exchanged documents. Both sides expressed their willingness to send ministers to each other. Regarding this matter, the Norwegian Government Information Office issued a statement by the Norwegian Foreign Minister as follows: "I am delighted to take this opportunity to express my pleasure at the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between us and the Soviet Union. Norway has maintained good neighborly relations with the Soviet Union for many years, and there have never been any disagreements between the two governments during the World War. Both sides naturally desire to see this friendly relationship strengthened and developed. At a time when the Soviet soldiers and civilians are fighting bravely against the German invasion, we are delighted that the Soviet-Norwegian relationship can be strengthened and developed. The operations of the Soviet soldiers and civilians have aroused the admiration of the world. Hitler's Germany is our common enemy. If Germany wins, Norway and the whole world will be oppressed and enslaved."

Reuters, Moscow, 6th - The official spokesman, Lozovsky, was asked at a reception for journalists yesterday whether the Soviet-Southern Treaty signed in the spring was still valid, because the Soviet side had announced new agreements with Poland and Czechoslovakia, but had not announced this with the Southern country. Lozovsky replied that the normal relationship between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia had been interrupted for a long time and needed to be restored. As for the Southern country, the return of the Southern Minister to Moscow indicated that the previous treaty was still valid.

### Ramblings on the European War (7)(3) - A firsthand Account of Atlantic Convoy Duty

This is a firsthand account by the famous American journalist Quentin Reynolds, who was aboard a cargo ship in a convoy from Canada to England. The following is a translation of his experiences:

The ship had been loading for three days. The continuous grinding noise of the massive winches filled the air. The cargo hold was almost full. This was a ten-thousand-ton cargo ship, but we had loaded it with seventeen thousand tons of goods. All kinds of items were included, almost without exception, including covered tugs, four airplanes, several tons of farm equipment, and hundreds of baskets of food.

The work on the deck was temporarily eased for a while, and then the winches and cranes became busy again. A large basket was carefully lifted up and quickly placed into the cargo hold. Another basket followed, and their careful manner suggested that it was full of eggs. In reality, the baskets were filled with something even more precious than eggs. They were filled with various powerful explosives, being hoisted onto the ship basket after basket.

The mate said with a smile, "Five hundred tons in total, a very good cargo."

Our ship was one of the ships in a convoy bound for England, part of the lifeline supplying the British with arms and food. Our ship had been docked for three days, loading cargo. We would stay in the harbor for two more days, waiting for the other ships to gather and load.

We finally set sail. The ships streamed out of the harbor one after another, an unprecedented assembly. There were small cargo ships flying the flags of Greece and Norway, as well as ships flying the Dutch flag, the Danish flag, and even the Swedish flag. We were now in a single line, our ship second in line, probably arranged according to size. The ships behind us stretched for miles. Once we were outside the harbor, the ships would form a fan shape or a cow line formation. From then on, only the shipmasters would know how to proceed. Within an hour, the pilot would leave the ship, and he was permitted to submit my report to the Canadian inspector for forwarding to Collier's magazine. How much of the convoy's information could be published was beyond my knowledge.

The ship we were on was the Blue Funnel Line's Talamba, a ten-thousand-ton vessel. She had sailed in the Far East for many years. She still retained her original Pacific sailors, no fewer than a hundred, of whom seventy-eight were Chinese.

There were only four passengers on the ship: a Danish technical consultant named Peransen, a British engineer named Gantler, a British food ministry official named Hobson, and myself. There were only two cabins on the ship, so we had to share a cabin with someone. I shared a cabin with Peransen. This turned out to be quite fortunate, as he liked to go to bed early and get up early, while I slept late and got up late. Although the cabin was only eight feet long and six feet wide, we each went our own way without intruding on each other.

The ship we were on was now slowly moving towards England. Her deck was only ten feet above the water, and the seventeen thousand tons of cargo had weighed her down as much as possible. Apart from the escorting warships, we were perhaps one of the fastest ships in the convoy, but we had to adjust our speed to match the slowest ship.

Like all cargo ships, we had armaments on board. We had five cannons. Two sailors managed the four-inch submarine gun at the stern, and four army soldiers, led by a corporal, managed four anti-aircraft guns.

The sailors were dismissive of the threat from submarines, but they dared not laugh at the bombers. Airplanes were indeed a problem, but the chances of being hit were slim. Lloyd's could provide insurance, charging only one percent. Being in a convoy was as safe as living in London during the Blitz‚Äîin fact, it was even safer, because there was no danger of being hit by a car under blackout conditions!

The sailors all received additional wartime pay for this voyage. The Chinese sailors' usual wage of thirty dollars a month was increased to fifty dollars a month in the convoy. The mate received an additional thirty-five dollars a month on top of his regular salary.

We expected this voyage to take eighteen days. From tonight, we would be under blackout conditions. The sides of the ship were painted black, and thick canvases hung over the doorways. We could not smoke on deck. We all had to keep our life preservers handy, and it was suggested that we should sleep in our clothes.

Looking back at Canada, there was only a faint yellow line, and in a few minutes, even that faint yellow line would disappear. We would not see land again until we reached England. I had eighteen detective novels in my suitcase and carefully planned to read one each day. We had plenty of food, plenty of drink, and an inexhaustible supply of fresh sea air, plus congenial company. I thought these eighteen days would pass easily.

Our ship was now slowing down gradually, and I had to hand over this report to the pilot. This would certainly be a very good journey. However, I wished the ship had five hundred tons of potatoes instead of fifteen hundred tons of explosives.

(The above section was mailed from Halifax Harbor. The following section was telegraphed from London after the convoy arrived.)

On the horizon, a wisp of faint smoke appeared. In the vast Atlantic Ocean, smoke meant a ship, but that ship could be friend or foe. The first mate held up his binoculars and watched carefully. The wisp of smoke gradually turned black, and sometimes the sea breeze blew, causing the horizon to rise and fall, and the smoke became fainter again. Later, we could see the ship.

### Eden Declares that any Threats to Thailand's Independence Would Lead to a Serious Situation, UK Has Expressed Concerns to Japan, Thailand also Deploys Troops to Defend its Territory

Reuters, London, 6th - Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today that any actions that threaten Thailand's independence and integrity would be considered an event of immediate concern to the United Kingdom, regarding it as a threat to the security of Singapore. The British government has alerted Japan to recent press commentary about Thailand that resembles the prelude to Japan's demands for bases in Vietnam. The British Ambassador to Japan has pointed out to the Japanese Foreign Minister that if Japan takes such steps, the most serious situation between the United Kingdom and Japan will be inevitable.

Reuters, Bangkok, 6th - The general public attaches great importance to the news that US Secretary of State Hull only met with the Thai Minister to the US after resuming his duties. They are now eagerly awaiting the results of this meeting. Local officials said they were unaware of any ongoing economic negotiations. Neutral observers especially call attention to the reported demands from both sides, saying that the Japanese side's first demand, the recognition of "Manchukuo" by Thailand, is definitely an economic demand, so military demands will undoubtedly follow.

Thailand Watches the Situation Develop

Reuters, Bangkok, 6th ‚Äì According to qualified observers, Thailand is currently watching the development of the situation with vigilance. The continued seriousness of the situation between Thailand and Japan is undoubtedly true, but the tension has now slightly eased. At the same time, Thailand and [missing information] can be seen in the large-character publication in the newspapers of the British message of the Far East crisis. Although the areas of Cambodia recently received by Thailand, according to the Thai-Vietnamese agreement, have provisions for non-fortification, Thai troops have received considerable equipment for defense. According to official announcements, Thailand's Eastern Route Army's tank force has been established in Battambang, and batches of mechanized units and a large number of police have also been distributed in the newly occupied areas. According to the provisions of the Tokyo Treaty, these troops will be allowed to stay for one month. According to the Silikron newspaper, a large number of Japanese troops are currently concentrating along the Great Lake bordering Cambodia and Thailand, and plans to build naval and air bases are underway.

Haitong News Agency, Bangkok, 6th ‚Äì It was officially announced here last night that Battambang (transliteration) in Cambodia has been designated as the headquarters of the Tank Force of the Thai Eastern Route Army. This location is only 50 kilometers away from the current border between Thailand and Vietnam.

United Press, Bangkok, 6th - Senior Thai authorities today absolutely deny the claim that British warships and the British warship HMS Walsbite appeared in the Gulf of Thailand (Siam Bay).

### Japanese Troops in Vietnam Continue to Move Towards the Thai Border, Hanoi Authorities Solemnly Deny that Japan has Made Demands on Guangzhou Bay

Reuters, Saigon, 6th ‚Äì A Japanese patrol ship and five destroyers are docked in the Saigon River. Every day, several Japanese cargo ships pass by their side and head upstream. At the same time, truck convoys continue to depart for the Thai border. Many trucks have been driving out since Saturday. Each convoy has six or seven Harley-Davidson motorcycles, sixty Chevrolet and Ford trucks. Half of the trucks carry 25 soldiers each, while the rest carry a few soldiers and some war equipment, including field guns and mortars. There are also several trucks carrying long-barreled guns, which can be used for various purposes, and their height can be used to resist aircraft, but heavy guns have not been seen. Warehouses and shipyards here are filled with Japanese troops from Tokyo, Vietnam. Other Japanese troops come from Guangzhou, and some of them participated in the battle in Nanning. The houses around the big square in Phnom Penh are now said to have been requisitioned by the Japanese army. The current rainy season will now hinder the Japanese military's operations. It is expected that the Japanese military will strive to consolidate its bases and arrange its military supplies within a few weeks. Japanese trucks are now using the gasoline they have brought in themselves. Saigon is still peaceful, but American businesses are now drastically reducing the number of foreign employees.

Havas News Agency, Hanoi, 6th ‚Äì Rumors that Japan has made certain demands on France for Guangzhou Bay have been solemnly denied by the authorities here, who said that this rumor is being spread for a purpose.

### Thailand Actually Announces Recognition of "Manchukuo"

United Press, Bangkok, 6th ‚Äì Yesterday, the Thai government announced its recognition of "Manchukuo."

### Japanese Young Parliamentarians Plan to Form a New Group

Reuters, Tokyo, 6th ‚Äì According to the Miyako Shimbun and the Nichinichi Shimbun, young members of parliament are now uniting to form a new political group, aiming to put the power of parliament on the basis of the war on the one hand and break the current situation of parliament on the other. This move was initiated by Hatoyama, a former member of the Seiyukai and former Minister of Education in the Saito Cabinet in 1932. Young members of various political parties are responding enthusiastically. The two newspapers predict that if members of the disbanded political parties gather together, various political factions that previously leaned towards the totalitarian party platform will form a new political group.

### Hong Kong Government Purchases Opium

Hong Kong ‚Äì It was revealed today that the Hong Kong government, in view of the shortage of smuggled opium and the inability to meet the needs of ordinary opium addicts, has had to purchase opium to meet their needs. The reason for the opium shortage here is that the Sino-Japanese war is taking place in South China, making it impossible to smuggle opium into Hong Kong. Therefore, the Hong Kong government has had to purchase HK$400,000 worth of raw opium to supply the addicts. This is the first decision by the government to purchase opium since 1937. It has recently purchased 135 boxes of this opium from Singapore. (United Press, 6th)

### Chongqing: A Mountain City. A Visit by Luce and His Wife, Publishing Titans (3)

At the embassy on the hilltop, Ambassador Johnson and the entire embassy staff welcomed us. We entered the house and looked out across the river at Chongqing. The sun was high in the sky, the weather was hot, and the scene seemed very peaceful. We could see no one and hear nothing. The boats were all tied to the shore, and the air was still. The ambassador was talking about the last air raid, how a certain part over there ‚Äì "Look, that large empty space on the hillside" ‚Äì was burned to the ground by incendiary bombs. The major took out his watch, looked up at the dazzling sky, and listened carefully. May 3rd and 4th, 1939, the most unforgettable days ‚Äì the first major air raids. At least five thousand people died, and thousands more were injured. And many more thousands lost their lives last year and the year before. But now the residents of Chongqing know how to deal with it. They simply leave the city, close their shops, hide their valuables, and take refuge in the air-raid shelters. Now no more than a hundred people die ‚Äì unless there is a major fire, no one will lose their life.

"The planes are coming over there!" I could not hear anything, and could not see anything in the dazzling sky. Then came a sound "Long, hoong long, hoong long, hoong long". A black smoke about a mile long rose from behind the mountain. The major pointed to the sky, and I saw the silver planes shining in the sunlight. There were six, twelve, yes, quite a few planes. The sound of "Hoong Long--Hoong Long" disappeared after a minute--this black smoke, black smoke with dust, rose to the sky, spread out, and then it became quiet. We waited, took a few photos, asked a few questions, and listened to them tell stories about the three years of bombing history.

We returned to the city, the most important thing being to find out how many were injured. On the road, we saw a hut or shop that was broken everywhere. People were busy picking through the piles of broken bricks, stacking them into piles, and salvaging damaged furniture. The whole street was bustling again, even busier than before. The air raid team, whom we had seen leaving for work three hours ago, was now marching back through the crowded streets. We walked to an open space at the Methodist Church, right in the center of this large mine site, which had been bombed into a large hole. The surrounding fifty yards was a pile of newly turned soil.

Sir Kerr, as everyone knows, is not only the most humorous foreigner in China, but, in the opinion of many, also one of the most capable diplomats. Kerr is a Scottish nobleman who adheres to liberalism. His residence is like a tea pavilion. The house was originally built for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, but was later rented to Sir Kerr, with the rent going to support the orphans of soldiers. Sir Kerr showed me the places around his residence that had been damaged by the bombs, where the plaster had fallen off. Then we sat down and talked for two hours about the political situation in China.

That night, we had dinner with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Foreign Minister Wang was a well-known scholar who had attended the Hague Tribunal and was about to retire from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Also present that evening were the young Mayor of Chongqing and his wife, who was good at telling stories. The Mayor's wife can be called a standard Chinese beauty, petite and exquisite, with a smooth, oval face. Her cherry-red mouth could speak cleverly and ingeniously.

There would be bombing tomorrow. The big one was at half past nine. Weidner was with us organizing telegrams, when a servant ran in quietly and said, "The first ball." The Japanese planes had just left Hankou. The servant was busy packing up various things, and we prepared to go to the air-raid shelter set up by the Central Bank at the other end of the city. There was a long flight of stone steps from the road to the bank and to the air-raid shelter behind the bank. About thirty or forty people had gathered on the steps‚Äîyou had to have a pass to enter this special air-raid shelter. A very beautiful American was sitting on the lower steps, wearing a pair of gray shorts. This person's name was William Hunt, and he was the authoritative representative for promoting various American products in China.

The sun gradually rose, and finally, the second emergency alarm sounded, and we all left the steps, passed through several guards in the passage, and ran into the basement. The one we reached was a very large basement, and although it was crowded, it was still quite comfortable. Bank employees and their families were taking refuge here. Part of it was really given to us and the Hunt Company. There was half an hour of chatting, guessing where the nearest bomb would fall‚Ä¶ then suddenly the whole cave became quiet. Of course, those with sharp hearing could distinguish the sound of the Japanese planes bombing. Boom‚Äîsplatter‚Äîboom‚Äîsplatter. These terrible noises lasted for half a minute, and then everything disappeared. Half an hour later, we had run out and saw the light of day again.

As we ran out of the stone steps of the air-raid shelter and onto the road, we happened to meet Mayor Wu, who was coming out to check the damage. He only stopped for a moment, gave a greeting, and ran. We had a great meeting that day‚Äîa tea party with Madame Chiang, and perhaps the Generalissimo as well. Madame Chiang has a stimulating personality, which no magical description of her can fully convey. When Madame Chiang walked into her large, dimly lit reception room, she spoke to me in English that was one hundred percent fluent; she spoke so fast that I had never heard anyone speak like that before. In the middle of the conversation, a door opened and a person ran into the room without being noticed. After a while the conversation continued. Then you suddenly felt that there was no one else in the room except the person who had just quietly run in. We all stood up. A slender, inviolable figure in gray clothes walked forward, and several clear greetings could be heard: "Good... good..." Madame Chiang introduced us. Her voice now carried a joyful and hospitable expression, and a hint of a smile appeared on her thin lips: "Good...good...good..." He walked over and stood in front of his chair. "Good... good..." He motioned for us to sit down.

He asked about our journey, and thanked us for our special visit. We made a brief reply, and Madame Chiang explained to him the things that were of interest to him. We had a meal‚Äîdelicate and simple food, which was exactly the kind of food I liked to eat most in China. I showed him a photo album, which contained photos of him and Madame Chiang, as well as many photos of other important government officials. He looked at the photos of himself and Madame Chiang with childlike joy. He looked at each photo very quickly, but he skipped over photos of less important government officials... An hour later, we knew we had met two people, a man and a woman, who will be remembered by people in countless centuries after they are gone, among the millions of people alive today.

During the three days in Chongqing, it became clear that it would be impossible to go to the front line in the shortest possible time. I had Mr. Dong Xianguang, the translator, convey to the Generalissimo that I wanted to see his troops. For half an hour, I only felt his gaze piercing. Now, after hearing this request, he nodded his head. Then he paused for a moment, I guess he was estimating the location of every plane in China. As we stepped out of the house, the good Mr. Dong's face was full of suspicion.

### British Lord Privy Seal Reports on International Situation in the House of Commons, Firmly Resolves to Effectively Aid the Soviet Union in its Resistance War, and Closely Monitors Developments in the Far East Situation

Reuters, London, 6th - Lord Privy Seal Attlee, when initiating the debate on the war situation in the House of Commons today, spoke of the great struggle of the Soviet people and army. He said, "Today, all eyes are turned to the great war from the White Sea to the Black Sea. The Soviet people and army are now engaged in a great battle in this vast theater of war (cheers) to resist the German army and the hangers-on of the Nazi regime. Anyone who attempts to predict the outcome of the war at this time is extremely foolish. The failure of the German General Staff's plan to achieve rapid gains is already very evident. As early as July 13th, the Germans were already claiming that the Stalin Line had been breached, but this has now been proven untrue. Murmansk, at the northern end, is still in Soviet hands. Soviet resistance is extremely strong. The enemy still needs a long journey to reach the railway from Leningrad to Murmansk. The German offensive on Leningrad from the southern coast of the Baltic Sea has recently made no real progress. Fierce battles are still raging around Smolensk. The path to Moscow seems far from open. As for Kyiv, which the Germans claimed to have occupied three weeks ago, it remains a fortress in the Soviet defense line. The German communiqu√©s have expressed amazement at the determination, courage, and combat power of the Soviet army (cheers). It is clear that the German side has suffered heavy losses in manpower and materials. I dare say that everyone is thrilled by this glorious resistance of the Soviet Union. We are now doing our best to provide this ally with all possible assistance. A British military mission began working in Moscow six days after the German invasion. A Soviet mission is also carrying out its tasks in London at the same time. We are now taking urgent steps to supply the Soviet Union with the military materials and supplies it has requested. The activities of our fleet in Kirkennes and other places in the north demonstrate how closely we are in contact with the Soviet army," said Attlee. He also mentioned the strength of the British air force offensive and warned the nation not to be overly optimistic. He said that Hitler has now been forced to fight on two fronts. Although the invasion of Britain has only been repeatedly postponed, it is by no means abandoned. The troops stationed in Britain have been ordered to prepare to the highest degree. The domestic defense forces are now fully equipped and ready. Their strength has greatly increased compared to a year ago. If the German army invades by sea and air, it will be destroyed immediately. Attlee finally mentioned the Far East, saying that the independent and parallel measures taken by Britain and the United States against Japan demonstrate the common interests of the two countries. Although the Japanese government protested that its motives were purely defensive, the British government is now maintaining the highest degree of vigilance, especially because the rhetoric of Japanese newspapers is inconsistent with its official assurances. There is evidence to show that Japan is shifting its attention to Thailand, a situation similar to that before the invasion of Vietnam.

Havas, Moscow, 6th - The evening paper quoted a London dispatch as saying that Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky had indicated to the British side that the Soviet Union would soon announce freedom of religion.

### First Batch of American Munitions Shipped to the Soviet Union by Sea, Fulfilling Promise of Material Assistance, Expected that Japan Will Not Interfere

Reuters, Washington, 6th - It was announced here today that the United States has shipped the first batch of munitions to the Soviet Union.

United Press, Washington, 6th - Sources in the capital revealed last night that the United States has fulfilled its promise to assist the Soviet Union and has shipped the first batch of military supplies to the Soviet Union. The first batch of goods includes military equipment and industrial machinery. The machinery was ordered before the German-Soviet war. Although Japanese newspapers have hinted that the U.S.'s shipping military supplies to the Soviet Union is an unfriendly act towards Japan, which is aligned with the Axis powers, and will increase tensions in U.S.-Japan relations, U.S. officials are skeptical that Japan will interfere with this move by the U.S. Well-informed sources do not attach much importance to Japan's threats, as they believe that Japan would not take this huge risk and further worsen U.S.-Japan relations. Furthermore, there is still a neutrality treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union. If Japan were to do so, would it not damage relations between Japan and the U.S.?

### U.S. Orders Large Number of Aircraft from Canada, Will be Shipped to China, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands East Indies

Reuters, London, 6th - According to a message from Ottawa, the United States is now purchasing 500 Whirlwind aircraft from Canada. It is reported that these aircraft will be shipped to China, the Netherlands East Indies, and possibly the Soviet Union.

### Soviet Officials Deny Sino-Soviet Conference Rumors

United Press, Moscow, 6th - Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky yesterday referred to the Japanese rumors that a Sino-Soviet military conference was being held in Chita, Siberia, and said that this news was "a completely baseless fabrication by imaginative newspapers."

### Amidst Tense Soviet-Japanese Relations, Toyota Meets with Soviet Ambassador, Probably to Explain Attitude towards Neutrality Treaty, Amendment of Commercial Treaty May Also Be Discussed

Reuters, Tokyo, 6th - After Foreign Minister Toyota took office, he declared to the ambassadors of the Axis powers Japan's adherence to the Tripartite Pact, but he had not yet expressed his attitude towards the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty to the Soviet Union. However, last night, he suddenly had his first meeting with Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin, which lasted quite a long time. It is generally expected that this is related to Japan's attitude towards the Soviet-German war, which has never been discussed before. Since official spokesmen have repeatedly stated that Japanese-Soviet commercial relations will continue, it is generally believed that Toyota will declare to the Soviet ambassador that Japan will not change its neutral policy. This meeting is probably also related to the need to amend the commercial treaty. Japan has recently been doing its utmost to secure the supply of necessary goods at home and in East Asia. According to Japanese official sources, the Japanese government is now considering further restricting the private use of oil and trying to increase the domestic production of natural and artificial oil and metals. At the same time, there is panic about the supply and distribution of Japanese food. The ministers of agriculture and home affairs reported this matter to the Japanese Emperor yesterday, saying that the recent floods have damaged the harvest, and the situation is more serious than previously expected.

Reuters, Tokyo, 6th - Counselor Qochkov of the Soviet Embassy visited Sakamoto, Director of the European and Asian Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at 2:20 p.m. today. He left after about an hour. The nature of the talks has not been disclosed.

### Vichy Government Issues Statement, Responding to Welles' Criticism

Reuters, London, 6th - The P√©tain government issued a statement yesterday in response to the criticism of U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles. The statement said, "Welles expressed doubts about the ability of the French Empire to resist attacks. In fact, the heroic resistance of the French army against the British aggression in Syria can certainly be regarded as a sufficient answer." Regarding Welles' statement that the U.S.'s attitude towards Vichy will depend on how France defends its empire, the Vichy statement said, "The Syrian and Vietnamese issues cannot be compared. Syria was invaded, while Vietnam was not. Moreover, Vietnam is geographically and politically in a special position because it is far from France, so Vietnam cannot wait for events that could change the balance of power in the Far East."

### American Railroad Workers Go On Strike, Request for Wage Increase Rejected, Over One Million People Participate

Both spoke fluent English.

Educational News - Director Yu Junxian of the Overseas Chinese Education Department to Inspect Overseas Chinese Education in the Philippines, Publishes Guidelines for Improving Overseas Chinese Education Before Departure

(Hong Kong Dispatch) Yu Junxian, Director of the Education Department of the Central Overseas Affairs Commission, came to Hong Kong to inspect overseas Chinese education. He completed his work and left Hong Kong on the morning of the 30th of last month at 9:30 a.m. on the Philippine Clipper to Manila, and will travel to various places in Southeast Asia to continue his inspection. Accompanying him is Yu's top student, Jiang Zhijian, who recently graduated from the Overseas Chinese Education Teacher Training Class and was assigned to work in the Philippines.

Inspection Itinerary - Yu said that the Overseas Affairs Commission has been very active in improving overseas Chinese affairs in recent years, and pays special attention to the development of overseas Chinese education. During the recent Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, Chairman Chen put forward a very detailed plan, which was approved by the meeting and has now been implemented. However, before implementation, it is necessary to have a real understanding of the current state of overseas Chinese education. He was ordered to inspect and investigate. His impressions in Hong Kong were very good. In the future, he will strengthen contacts in order to gradually improve. After Yu arrives in the Philippines, he will stay for a week, then go to Singapore, and then to Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. It was originally planned to go to Australia, but due to the current turbulent situation in the South Pacific, whether it will be possible to go there will be decided after arriving in Singapore. On the return journey, he will continue to inspect Burma and India before returning to China. The length of the trip is still difficult to determine.

Popularizing Overseas Chinese Education - The main purpose of the Overseas Affairs Commission's plan to improve overseas Chinese education is to popularize overseas Chinese education. According to current estimates, there are 700,000 to 800,000 overseas Chinese students in Southeast Asia. Recent surveys show that less than 300,000 children are enrolled in schools. Therefore, in order to ensure that all overseas Chinese students have the opportunity to enroll in schools, it is necessary to increase the number of overseas Chinese schools. This depends on the enthusiasm and scholarship of overseas Chinese organizations and is unlikely to be successful in the short term. Currently, it is planned to expand existing overseas Chinese schools in the hope of doubling the number of students enrolled. The rest will be gradually promoted. The training of teachers should also be prepared early. The methods to be carried out include lecturing and training old teachers, and cultivating new teachers. For the former, the classes will be transferred for training in stages, and the latter will be promoted in various ways. On the one hand, the Ministry of Education is requested to order each normal school to designate 50 places for cultivating overseas Chinese education talents. On the other hand, overseas Chinese teacher schools will be established in Fujian and Guangdong provinces. The one in Fujian province will open this summer with a funding of 200,000 yuan. The one in Guangdong province will be established next year. The teacher training class run by the Overseas Affairs Commission has 30 graduates this year, who will be assigned to serve in various places. The Overseas Affairs Commission's total education funding for this year is 1.2 million yuan. In addition, two overseas Chinese middle schools will be established for the children of returned overseas Chinese to enroll in, with an annual funding of 300,000 yuan.

### Yunnan Province Prepares to Select Students for Study in the United States

### Overseas Chinese Student Wins American Art Competition

(New York Dispatch) It was announced here that the $1,000 first prize in the American magazine Youth Open Art Competition was won by Gong (Frdd Gong), an 18-year-old overseas Chinese student in the first year of Lincoln High School in Portland, Oregon. Gong's work was the best among the 57,000 entrants nationwide. It depicts the efforts of the people of the Northwest to develop land resources, including the arrival of the first settlers in covered wagons less than a century ago, to today's modern mining cities, dams, and highways. Before returning home to Oregon, this overseas Chinese youth will draw leaflets for the United Aid to China Movement. Mr. Lu Gouren and Mr. Ma Pengnian, wealthy merchants in maritime pearls, have recently admired Mr. Ma Shoubai of Tongchang Jewelry Store for his righteous act of organizing scholarship loans, and have therefore saved on entertainment expenses to organize talent cultivation scholarship loans, tentatively for 10 high school students, regardless of gender. The method is as follows: From now on, those who have an application form, attach a transcript of grades from the last semester and a two-and-a-half-inch half-length photo, and whose academic performance must be within the top eight in the school, can send a letter to Mr. Li Jiean, Showzhou Bookstore, 33 Seymour Road, for collection. The deadline is the 15th of this month. On the 17th at 2 p.m., an interview will be held at the Jiangdong Middle School on Foch Road, Chongqing Road. If successful, a letter will be sent for loan negotiation. If unsuccessful, certificates can be collected from the submission address from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. on the 22nd.

### Senior Nurse School News from the First Hospital of the Relief Association

The First Hospital of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in order to promote nurse education, cultivate noble character in women, and serve the people, opened a Senior Nurse Vocational School two years ago, appointing Ms. Wu Zheying as the principal. Wu graduated from the Changci Hao Budong's Nurse School in the United States. After returning to China, she served as the head nurse of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, the principal of the Chinese Red Cross General Hospital Nurse School, and the president of the Chinese Nurses Association, as well as the advisor to the International Red Cross in China. She is a pioneer in China's nursing field. Under the guidance of Principal Wu, the school is managed seriously and has achieved remarkable results. It has been registered with the Education Bureau and the Chinese Nurses Association. This year, a class of students can participate in the joint examination. The school is affiliated with the First Hospital of the Refugee Relief Association. Because it contains the word "refugee," many outsiders initially had misunderstandings. Therefore, the students recruited in the first session were of uneven levels. However, the principal of the school is highly respected, and the teachers are mostly specialized scholars. They are completely dedicated to sacrificing their services and do not count their remuneration as their career. After the outside world recognized the school, the second and third enrollments, as well as the recent enrollments, were mostly students who had graduated from junior high school, or had equivalent academic qualifications, and students with high school levels, who came to take the exams, which have met the educational standards. According to Principal Wu, the status of nurses in medical affairs is extremely important, because the time that doctors spend diagnosing and treating patients every day is far less than the time that nurses spend taking care of patients. Nurses are the right-hand men of doctors. This kind of life-saving work requires a noble character, considerable knowledge, and a spirit of enthusiastic service. Therefore, the standards for training students must be raised. According to the current situation of the hospital, there are 300 patients. Calculating that one person cares for five beds, theoretically 120 nurses can be trained. With studentsÂÖºÂÆû‰π†, it is more economical than hiring nurses from outside. However, due to the limited school buildings, not many can be accommodated. At present, in addition to the 35 students in classes A, B, and C, it is heard that there are many applicants for this year's enrollment (the exam is from August 2nd to 9th), but because it is planned to recruit 30 more people, it is feared that it will be difficult to admit more.

### Going to a Higher School ¬∑ Taking an Entrance Exam ¬∑ Self-Study Essential Composition Book for Middle School

Chinese is a major subject in middle school, and composition is the writing technique in the Chinese subject, which should be emphasized even more. Elementary school graduates and high school students, whether they are taking entrance exams to go to a higher school, or self-studying during the summer vacation, should study composition carefully. The two major books "National Modern High School Composition Essence" and "National Modern Junior High School Composition," compiled and evaluated by Chinese experts Hu Puan and Tai Shuangqiu, are the only practical books for studying composition. The book collects excellent student representative works from over 4,000 middle schools across the country and is edited into eleven major categories, including narrative, explanation, argumentation, academic, postscript, description, essays, biographies, applications, poetry, and translation. The content is rich and easy to imitate. By studying the works of others, one can improve one's own thinking and writing skills, and composition difficulties can be overcome. Everyone who has read it praises it. Each book is in four thick volumes, with over 1,200 pages, originally priced at ten yuan, but now during the summer vacation, there is a special price of six yuan and eighty cents for students. The book is published by Quanfen Bookstore, 392 Laoishenfu Road, Shanghai. The storefront is at 277 Simalu Road. Other bookstores such as Xifei, Jiankang, Dongxin, and Penglai also sell it on consignment.

### Summer Basketball Invitational League Full Schedule Announced Yesterday The Final Four Will Begin Competing Next Wednesday

The 1941 Shanghai Summer Basketball Invitational League, which has invited the four major powerhouses of the city, including All Black, Hushing, Blue White, and Qianghua, to participate in the competition, is a single-round robin tournament to compete for this year's Shanghai basketball supremacy, and is truly a grand summer basketball event. It was originally scheduled to open this week, but because the city's disaster relief center is hosting a charity basketball and volleyball event this Saturday, it has been postponed to next Wednesday (13th). The second match is scheduled for next Saturday (16th), and the final match is scheduled for the 20th of this month (Wednesday). If it rains, it will be postponed for one day. The locations for the three matches are all planned to be held at the Guoqiang Middle School court on Carter Road. The full schedule was announced yesterday, including the opening matches of Blue White vs. All Black and Hushing vs. Qianghua, which are even more exciting programs than have been seen since the YMCA. Although the teams participating in the league are the same as the teams participating in the charity match that opens this week, the different round-robin and elimination systems are different paths to different goals. The final four lineups and the date of advance ticket sales will be disclosed in succession within days. The full schedule is as follows:

The Chess Cloth Ping Pong Club held a meeting at 8 p.m. the other night at the Tongfu Silk Shop on Tianjin Road to discuss participating in the Invitational Senior Cup League. Over a dozen people attended the meeting, including Chairman Chen Linsheng, Chen Tianjue, members Chuan Guiqing, Cao Junbo, and team leader Cheng Shuming. The meeting was chaired by Chen Linsheng. First, Cheng Shuming reported on the recent status of the team, and then the matter of participating in the Senior Cup was discussed. It was generally believed that the competition still used soft balls, which was inconsistent with the club's year-long efforts to promote the use of hard ball competition. Moreover, the world's ping pong community has long used hard balls for competition, so the ping pong level has improved a lot. Soft balls were eliminated four or five years ago. To uphold Chairman Chen's ambition to promote hard balls, it was unanimously decided not to participate in the competition. As for the club's individual ball cup tournament, it is currently actively preparing and collecting prizes, and will be held in a spacious hall in the autumn. At that time, there will also be Chinese and Western ping pong masters, both male and female, participating in the performance. All competitions will use hard balls.

### Finance The Keen Interest of Chinese Merchants: USD $600,000 Invested in US Currency

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, posted exchange rates remained unchanged. The unofficial market for the British and American exchange rates continued to tighten sharply, but Chinese speculators continued to exert great effort to push the rates higher. Despite signs that British and American commercial firms were willing to offer currency, a coal settlement by Yi Tai Hing required funds, and HSBC only supplied USD $1,000 at a rate of $5.125. The small counter was reduced to $5.0625. The zeal of Chinese merchants to push rates higher only increased. Although Hong Kong Electric released some British currency, the interest of Ewo and the Chinese banks to absorb it was positive, leading to a simultaneous tightening of both exchange rates until the midday close. Trading was quite active during the morning session. Chinese speculators purchased US dollars to the amount of 5-600,000. There was no trading on Wednesday afternoon.

More Coal Settlements

Since morning, the cable news from the silver market showed a large and long increase. The exchange rate between the US and India remained flat, while the pound's exchange rate against Shanghai weakened by 0.03125. Other rates remained unchanged. The central posted exchange rates remained the same. The opening price in the domestic market (according to Reuters) for the British pound was 3 shillings and 0.078125 pence. Chinese speculators were buying US dollars for delivery in August and September, with a few at a price of $5.15625, but later only at $5.125. The momentum had already softened. HSBC's posted exchange rate remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax increased by 25, accounting for a slight percentage of 24.50%. It was heard that Hong Kong Electric released British pounds for August delivery at a rate of 3 shillings and 0.09375 pence. After being absorbed by Ewo and the Chinese banks, there were reports of coal settlements. HSBC sold August currency at a rate of $5.125, but the amount was extremely small. Speculators pushed the rate up to only $5.09375. The market momentum tightened somewhat at midday. Hong Kong Electric offered British pounds for August at 3 shillings and 0.0625 pence, so the closing prices for spot and September delivery were only 3 shillings and 0.046875 pence, and $5.09375 for US dollars. This was $0.015625 tighter than the previous day's closing price for US dollars, and $0.03125 tighter for US currency.

Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises Alone

Hong Kong, 6th (Wednesday) Dispatch: This morning, the foreign exchange market opened with rates, but no trading volume. The spot exchange rate for Shanghai rose independently by five dollars to $480. The remainder remained unchanged. There was no trading on Wednesday afternoon.

The exchange rates for New York telegraphic transfers and Shanghai currency remained unchanged. The unofficial market for "Joint Notes" rose by 25 cents to $55.

### Many Turning Bullish: The Gold Market Thrives

Yesterday, the unofficial gold market rose sharply, with prices soaring beyond the $6,800 mark. All parties shared a unanimous bullish sentiment, entirely due to the foreign exchange market tightening amid speculative buying. The Shanghai West-side Gang turned bullish and invested heavily, while gold shops and securities firms also competed fiercely to invest. The price rose from $6,758 to reach the floor price. The gains expanded at noon, rising to $6,820, and ultimately continued to surge by $60. The half-day trading volume was 6-70,000 taels. There was no trading on Wednesday afternoon. The cash price increase slowed, but unprecedented high prices emerged one after another. A securities firm sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop at a price of $8,560. Cheng Kee spent Yuan to buy 30 taels, and Tian Yuan spent 20 taels at a new high price of $8,570. Ming Feng spent Yuan to buy 40 taels, and Cheng Kee spent Hong Qing Yong to buy 30 taels for $8,560, an increase of another $60. Jewelry gold also rose by $5, reaching $875.

Futures Rise by Another $60

Since morning, each bar (10 taels) opened at 9:15 AM for $6,770, $12 higher than the previous day's closing price. At that time, due to Ho Shing's aggressive selling during the buying frenzy, it rose to $6,775, and then retreated to $6,758. With US dollars difficult to settle at $5.15625, Taifeng, Gonghe, Tong Kang Yong, and Defu came in strongly to invest, surging $32 to reach $6,790. Xin Feng Yong, Cheng Kee, and Yi Yuan released currency, pushing it down to $6,760. It then stabilized for a long time until around 11:00 AM. The tightening of the foreign exchange market intensified the buying frenzy again. Heng Kee, Yi Feng, Yi Da, Dingsheng Retail Investors, and others poured in, and the Shanghai West-side Gang searched for currency. The price suddenly rose by $55, reaching $6,815, as Xiang Xing Yong and Li Tai sold. It retreated to $6,790. However, as the foreign exchange rate remained tight, Yi Yuan, Xiang He, He Shing, Chi Da and others aggressively invested, surging $30 to reach $6,810. Defu and Taifeng sold, pushing it back to $6,805. The midday close was again raised to $6,818. After closing, Yi Yuan continued to release currency, falling back to $6,812. The final price rose to $6,820. The difference during the first half of the day was $62. The price ultimately continued to rise by $6. Based on the August US dollar settlement price of $5.09375, the gold price was $6,836.8, a premium of $18.8. There was no market or price outside the exchange on Wednesday afternoon. The selling price at cash gold shops was $8,600, with a deduction of $200 for buying back. There was no price or market for cash margins.

Jewelry Gold Exchange Rate Reaches a Daily High

The exchange rate for jewelry gold at gold shops, per tael, was initially posted by Datong Heng and Xin Tong Heng at $870. It rose by $5 at 11:00 AM to $875, with a deduction of $40 for buying back.

### Hong Kong Dollars Exceed Five Dollars

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw gold futures rise, but the cash price remained stable, so British and American gold pounds also stabilized. British currency notes rebounded by one dollar. American currency notes opened at $1,941 and rose to $47 before suddenly falling back to $39. Shun Yuan, United Xie Tai, Yong Xiang Yuan, and Yong and others took the opportunity to buy cheaply, raising it to $60. The midday close was $1,959, up $21 from the previous day. The spot price was $19.55. Hong Kong currency notes showed a strong upward trend, rising to $5.05 in the evening market. Canadian currency notes also showed a strong trend. Japanese currency notes and Korean currency notes both trended firmer and higher. The former rose to $2.26, and the latter rose to $1.78.

### Securities: Due to the Timing of Bond Interest, Unified A Bonds Were Sold Considerably

The unofficial market for public bonds yesterday initially weakened but then strengthened. The early weakness was due to long positions being liquidated, followed by short covering, resulting in strengthening. The trend was generally sideways, and future developments hold little hope. Long positions were gradually wavering. Currently, short covering transactions are still being used to provide support. Various public bonds continued to report strong prices. The A bond, however, bucked the trend and weakened. This was because those who held long positions were unwilling to wait for the lottery draw. Although the chances of winning the lottery with A bonds are high, the benefits obtained after winning are limited. The full amount can only be received after thirteen months. If the bonds are sold at 90% of market value after winning, the profits are even smaller. Moreover, whether one wins the lottery is still uncertain, so many people are selling A bonds and buying B bonds, considering it a speculative opportunity amidst other speculation. Yesterday morning, Xinhua, Yongchang, and Runli bought, while Yitai and Hongda sold. The midday close was weaker. In the afternoon, Yichang, Zhongfu, and Dingkang sold in, while Xinhua and Lianyi covered their positions. C bonds again broke through the $8 mark. Aside from the A bond, which fell by 25 cents, and the D bond, for which there was no trading, all other bonds were slightly better by 11 cents to 40 cents. Trading volume gradually decreased. The total daily turnover was only around 1.2 million. A concise table is listed below:

For stock transactions, 50 shares of Xinxin Company were traded at a price of $28.25.

The public utilities stock market opened steady and closed weak, with some changes in between. Public bus stock initially saw aggressive buying, with the price rising from $18.60 to $20.00, but then reversed and fell by about one dollar.

### Coal: Shortage of Cooked Coal Spot Goods

The cooked coal business has recently seen slight movement in sales due to a limited supply of coke. Meanwhile, the self-igniting coal merchants, seeing the popularity of bituminous coal and high costs, have reduced production, resulting in a significant shortage of spot goods on the market. Cooked coal merchants have no goods to sell and have to offer high prices to surrounding households to search for old orders to meet market demand. Therefore, there is a significant price difference, ranging from approximately $460 to $480. Most of the shops on this street are out of stock and have stopped selling, it is said.

### Different Views on Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market is Neither Up Nor Down

The yarn market remains flat due to weak actual trading. As for Hong Kong, the supply of 32-count single yarn and 42-count yarn are both for local consumption in Hong Kong, so the trading is still good. However, due to continued obstructions in the transport of 20-count yarn into the mainland, there is little progress in purchasing, resulting in a sluggish market. Market sentiment is divided. Those who are bullish say the raw material prices have risen recently, and securities firms and gold shops are buying in the gold market. However, others in the industry say that sales are slow, inventories are sufficient, and the price of mixed yarns is increasingly cheap. 20-count Fairy Maiden yarn is only selling for $1,410, and 20-count Double Globe is selling for $1,385 to $90. By comparison, Double Horse is uniquely expensive, and the factories seem quite willing to sell. Therefore, they tend to sell when prices are high. With the two sides strongly disputing, the market is unable to rise and unable to fall. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was $1,582, and the low price was $1,566. The afternoon market was unusually loose, with few transactions. It initially traded at $1,572, falling to $70, and the final transaction was $1,574.

Double Horse Agricultural Opening: Although the bullish sentiment was high, the market atmosphere was ordinary. As prices were called higher, everyone wanted to sell. The opening price was $1,5177, and it soon rose to $1,582. Then, due to poor sales of 20-count yarn from guest customers, it fell back to $1,565. Before long, due to rising margins, some of the securities firms came back to push the price up, rising to $1,582. However, those in the industry who were hedging were very prevalent. By the time the market closed, it had fallen back to $1,574. The total trading volume for the half-day was 6,190 bales. The amounts bought by each side are listed on the left:

Industry Peers 6,000 Hong Kong 190 Total 6,190

The market conditions for Double Horse Agricultural Futures Yarn: At the morning opening, US cotton continued to trend downward, and bulls from gold shops and securities firms closed their positions. Except for a slight increase of half a dollar for September delivery, August delivery fell by three dollars, and September fell by three and a half dollars. After the opening, it was heard that the Double Horse factory's single yarn was still tight, and with gold prices continuing to rise, new buying and short covering were heavy. August delivery rose to $1,459, September delivery to $1,534, and October delivery to $1,542. After entering the market, due to a lack of progress in customer sales, the bulls turned to selling at high prices. August delivery fell slightly to $1,451, September delivery to $1,521, and October delivery to $1,533. There was a slight rebound at the end. August delivery was flat in the afternoon, September fell by two and a half dollars, and October fell by four and a half dollars. 700 bales were traded. Later, trading was sluggish, and prices all eased, falling by one to four dollars. The evening close showed that August delivery fell by four dollars from the previous day, September delivery fell by three and a half dollars, and October delivery fell by six dollars. The total daily trading volume was 9,590 bales, a decrease of 8,410 bales from the previous day. The daily opening, closing, high and low prices are recorded on the left (net quoted prices):

### Cotton Mills Cannot Afford

The cotton yarn situation is increasingly showing firmness with softness. The general consensus is that factory demand has been quiet for a long time, prices have not loosened at all, and transactions have decreased significantly. In addition, the overseas cotton market is also in a state of hesitation. As for the local cotton, cotton merchants unanimously expect it to rise, but consumers are pessimistic about the prospects for cotton yarn, creating an inverse relationship with cotton merchants. Therefore, it is difficult to find much enthusiasm.

In other news, trading in foreign cotton orders in Shanghai is showing weakness due to falling US and Indian cotton prices. At the same time, due to the chaotic international situation and the looming Pacific crisis, the intention to purchase is reduced. In recent days, only spot trading for goods about to arrive in Shanghai has been somewhat active. Factories are cautiously engaging in direct orders from overseas.

The New York cotton market initially fell due to Washington political news unfavorable to bulls and weakness in New Orleans. Yesterday, the Secretary of the Treasury criticized Smith's bill to support cotton farmers. At the same time, the government's announcement that cotton loans must be lower than the current situation by two points caused panic. However, it then rose slightly due to some short covering. As a result, closing prices were lower than the previous day by 23 to 28 pounds each, depending on the quality.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to buying by speculators, but then fell slightly due to profit-taking by bulls and a weather report unfavorable to bulls. Yesterday's closing prices were up two to seven rupees each. The opening market today is forecast to fall by four to four and a half rupees.

### Piece Goods: Bleached and Dyed Fabrics, Twill: Active Exports to Southeast Asia

Factory Fabrics: Yesterday's market trend continued to be firm due to active exports to Southeast Asia from Hong Kong firms and Southeast Asian firms. There was a coordinated sentiment. Fine yarn and printed fabrics rose more due to increased raw material and processing costs. White fabrics rose slightly less. Lun Chang's Clore silk rose from a recent price of $47 to $49. Soil linen cloth and wool serge each rose about one dollar per bolt. White cloth, Fugui fine cloth, fine twill, and plain cloth were stable. Various brands rose by 25 cents to 50 cents per bolt due to the urgent need for dyeing factories. The street traded over one thousand bolts of each fabric. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian firms imported over 5,500 bolts of bleached and dyed fabrics and twill.

Eastern Cloth: The situation continued to be expensive, but selling was slightly uneven. Futures for each month fell by about 15 cents per bolt on the exchange. Spot goods, leading fine cloth factory orders, also fell by 10 cents. The afternoon close was $52.65. However, mid-range and lower-end mixed-brand fine cloth and fine twill all reported price increases. This was because the demand for dyeing and sales on the street was constant, and the roots of hand goods were gradually tightening. Each bolt continued to rise by 35 cents each. Trading in colored Four Gentlemen serge was clearer, and prices were fairly stable. The evening close for new orders with new taxes was $1.73, and new orders with old taxes was $1.665. Both fell by 1 cent. Sales of wool flannel continued to decline. Guest firms had difficulty obtaining transportation permits, and transportation was obstructed, resulting in very little smooth business. This street‚Äôs actual sales were declining, and new additions were also sluggish. There were initial signs of interest in autumn and winter goods, but prices rose sharply due to the freezing of British and American exchange rates. After the rise in prices last week, back households also stopped importing. As a result, the trading in small-scale retail was very low, but the market price for bulk goods did not change due to sluggish sales. The market atmosphere remained strong and rising. Those holding goods were extremely reluctant to sell. Prices for various wool flannel goods all increased. Yinfeng 1470 French lining was sold for $1.60 per yard yesterday, black carbon lining was $4.25, Wensuchen ramie cloth was $2.50, Rentai Ape Man Tarzan raincoat silk was $6.50, Bobelin was $6, and lining wool was $2.50.

### Grains: Rice Prices Rebound

Yesterday, the foreign rice market was once again in a sideways state, gradually rebounding. The early market was steady, the mid-market was weak, and the afternoon market rose again due to heavy buying. As a result, both futures and spot goods rose by one to two dollars compared to the previous market. Rumors favored the buyers in the early green rice market, and the market was relatively stable. However, as new japonica rice arrived one after another, and new early indica rice from the mainland was also sighted, both the Wuhu area and the Jiangbei new early indica rice had full harvests. Buyers of foreign rice from various ports in the Yangtze River in the mainland have stopped buying, and new indica rice will soon flood the market. Therefore, the market sentiment immediately followed the market price downward. Then, major customers absorbed at low prices, and demand in western Shanghai was even more enthusiastic. Furthermore, all kinds of rumors favored the buyers, and the market gradually rose. Xiaojiao Yinghua S was sold from $147 to $147.5, Number Two Siamese Rice from $137.5 to $138.8, and spot Xiaowen also rose from $117.8 to $120, which was a larger dollar or two higher than the previous market. 20,000 bags and 600 tons were traded. The closing prices for spot goods were as follows: Number One Saigon $131, $130; Middle Goods $129; Number Two $122, $120; Number Two Siamese White $19.5, $19; Tall $122; Min Dang $130; Middle Jue $124 to $121; Shangfo rice $127.8; Dutch white japonica $131.2; Bank Sample Xiaojiao White $19.5, Outer Stack $18.5; Tokyo Short Tip $128.8, $115; Broken Tip $92 to $89.9. In short, it went through periods of weakness and tightness, changing back and forth, and still increased by a dollar or so compared to the closing price of the previous market.

The thick and thin japonica domestic rice market continued to be weak due to increased supply. Sales on this street and in rural shops were weak, creating an imbalance between supply and demand. The market continued to fall. Early and late indica rice from Kainang Port were sold at $149, $147. Wuxi original package white japonica was $144. As for glutinous rice, the market was also sluggish, and although goods were scarce, it was still difficult to gain a foothold and continued to depreciate by one dollar. The opening price for Hong Kong white high was $124.5. Substandard yellow was $118.5. Glutinous tea was $113 to around $110. Domestic glutinous rice was uniquely short, as the inventory in the mainland was about to run out and the supply had been cut off for a long time. Limited spot goods were unwilling to be easily sold and remained at a small profit, still selling for $126.

### Flour Prices Slightly Tighter

Yesterday's flour market was initially tight but then loosened, resulting in a slight improvement. Golden Dragon Flour was the most actively traded, initially at $31.70, then to $6.50 and $6.60. Qichang Stack goods were $31.45, and Fortress Flour was $33. A total of about 10,000 bags were traded. The remaining brands, such as Huayu and Clock Tower Flour, Taikoo and Roosevelt Stack goods (not weighed) were $33. Bank Stack goods (weighed) were in the range of $34.30 to $34.40. The market was sideways, without much rise or fall.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans and Corn: Stockpilers Unload, Prices Rebound Slightly

Yesterday, soybean sales were slightly weaker than before. Some stockpilers gradually unloaded at high prices, so the market trend turned weak. Prices fell slightly from the previous day. The whole market saw Hong Kong firms purchase 600 bags of Jiaozhou soybeans at a price of $51.50 to $51. 200 bags of Qingkou soybeans were inquired about on this street at a price of $50.05 to $50. 300 bags of Guide substandard soybeans were sold at a price of $48.50.

Stockpilers of corn were gradually selling off their inventories. Only Japanese firms were buying a little, so the trend lacked the power to rebound and was weak. Yesterday, 2,000 bags of Saigon and Dutch corn were sold, with prices falling by half a dollar to one dollar.

### Sugar Market: Both Dutch Red and White Sugar Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to trend upward due to international situation rumors that favored the bulls. The company's two-four coarse white sugar, for August 10 delivery, was initially $102.5, then fell slightly to $1.90, then rose to $2.80, a gain of 50 cents. August 20 was $102.8, rising to $3.80, a gain of 5 cents. Public association trading: Spot two-four coarse white, arriving in July, was $103.5 to $4.10, up 60 cents. June was $102.5 to $3.70, up 70 cents. May was $101.8 to $3.50, up one dollar. April was $1023, and March was $102.2 to $2.80, a gain of nearly one dollar. Dutch red NT mark was $86.5 to $87, up $2.20. Taikoo car white B mark was $130, unchanged. HX mark was $107.5 to $8, and the local factory's Number One ice was $135. Jingming ice was $137.

### Seafood: Ningbo Sea Blubber Freshly Offered

The genuine Ningbo seafood, such as dried jellyfish, is extremely tight for old goods, while new goods have fallen back. New jellyfish skin is $90, and old goods are $140. New jellyfish heads are $70, and old goods are $130.

Dried squid has risen again. Zhoushan goods are $430, Ningbo goods are $270, and Yantai goods are $360.

Ningbo seedless light kelp has just begun to offer fresh. The opening price was $650. Old goods have long been scarce and there is no market.

### North-South Goods: Huaibei Vegetables Arrive Yesterday

A batch of Huaibei vegetables officially arrived yesterday, totaling 81 packages. They have not yet been transferred to the stack. The large goods will be available today. Scattered Xuzhou vegetables have arrived. The market price has risen by another four to five dollars due to a shortage of spot goods.

### Wood Ear Rebounds

Wood ear prices have recently rebounded by 20-30 dollars due to the scarcity of arrivals and slightly more active sales. The opening price for the Hekou ear was over $752. The airmail ear rose to $780. Ordinary ears were $732-40 to $720.

### Metals: Large Ma-kou Iron: Reluctant to Sell Off Easily

The transaction of 14th and 26th Large Ma-kou Iron, saw a slight increase in searches by local lock factories, machinery factories, and yarn factories yesterday and the day before. Sentiment among industry peers remained firm and high. Yesterday's standard market price for 24th goods was 1,500 dollars per box, and 26th floral was 1,250 dollars per box, which was 70-80 to 100 dollars higher than the previous market. As this type of goods has been scarce for a long time and market inventory is very low, industry peers are more determined to hold on to the goods, and are very reluctant to easily sell even wholesale transactions of five or ten boxes.

### Regulations on the Supply of Foreign Exchange by the Four Banks promulgated by Order of the Ministry of Finance

Chinese Banks Can Also Operate According to Law: Legitimate Merchants' Trade Will Be Safeguarded

According to reliable sources, the US government has issued a total of 14 general communiqu√©s announcing the freezing of funds from China and Japan, covering numbers 55 to 69 inclusive. Numbers 58 and 59 specifically define the procedures, authorizing 14 banks to handle import and export trade between China and any part of the UK, South America, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies, so that it can maintain a normal state and prevent any negative impact. In addition, the other communiqu√©s divide the regions affected by the US government's freezing order into different areas, stipulating detailed procedures for each based on their individual circumstances, and designating several banks in each region to operate foreign exchange business under special license. The document accepted by the four banks, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, is a copy of Communiqu√© 14. The US consulate only delivered it to the Shanghai branches of the four banks yesterday morning.

Chinese Banks Can All Supply

Yesterday, inquiries made with the four banks revealed that import merchants who are engaged in importing goods that are not on the prohibited import list and are necessary for the country, must obtain approval from the Chinese government before being permitted to apply for foreign exchange purchases. The applicant must submit the names, quantities, prices, import, and marketing locations of the goods being purchased, together with supporting documents, requesting approval for the purchase of foreign exchange. For legitimate Chinese merchants in the Shanghai concession area who need foreign exchange to order foreign goods, in addition to purchasing foreign exchange at the black market exchange rate from four Allied banks such as Exchange National Bank and Citibank, they may also purchase it from the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, as well as Chinese banks engaged in foreign exchange business. However, the approval procedures for the supply of foreign exchange by the four banks and Chinese banks will be promulgated by order of the Ministry of Finance. It will be implemented after the order arrives in Shanghai. Therefore, the need for foreign exchange for all necessities can be obtained according to the regulations. The purpose is to safeguard the trade of legitimate merchants.

Preventing Abuse in the Hands of China

Economists say that the US government's implementation of the freezing of Japanese funds has a political significance that outweighs its economic significance. This is because before taking decisive action in the Pacific, it would be inconvenient for the US government to take sudden, sweeping action. Moreover, the situation in Shanghai is complex and the environment is special. Foreign firms in Shanghai have enormous rights and interests, and the US government is now reluctant to make unnecessary sacrifices. Furthermore, the Chinese financial authorities have repeatedly stated that they will maintain the black market in Shanghai. Since the US government's freezing of funds from China and Japan was made at the request of the Chinese government, then the legal applications for foreign exchange on the Shanghai market will naturally be supplied by the designated banks as much as possible. Therefore, it is expected that speculators in the city will use the names of certain import and export firms or companies to actively engage in foreign exchange speculation. However, the Chinese government authorities can maintain contact with the US government at any time, as needed, to stipulate special procedures and promulgate them to eliminate this illegal foreign exchange trading.

### Mobil Oil Tanker Still Detained

The Japanese Side Claims to be Investigating

According to the China Press, when a Japanese Navy spokesman met with reporters yesterday (the 5th), he was asked about the detention of the Mobil Oil Company's oil tanker "Mobil Glory" by the Japanese authorities. The spokesman replied that the ship was currently detained pending the completion of certain investigations. The Japanese authorities are currently investigating as quickly as possible, and do not want to prolong the detention any further than absolutely necessary. As for the reason for the detention of the "Mobil Glory," it is said that the ship did not sail to a small port on the south bank of the lower reaches of the Jiangyin River, as stated in the customs clearance form, but sailed upstream 10 miles to Xingang, changing its destination without prior notice, resulting in its detention and escort back to Shanghai. The Japanese side is currently investigating its actions.

### Foreigners' Travel Ban in North China to be Lifted Soon

According to the Continental Times, regarding the recent ban by the Japanese side on British and American nationals traveling in North China, a spokesman for the Japanese embassy told reporters of the New China News Agency yesterday (the 5th) that this ban is expected to be lifted soon. He believes that the ban on travel is not retaliation for the British and American actions to freeze Japanese funds, but if it is indeed a retaliatory act, then the ban will not be lifted until the relationship between Japan, Britain, and the US has greatly improved. The spokesman also stated that in the future, foreigners may not be able to travel by train in North China, but foreigners from ports such as Yantai will be able to travel by ship in the future.

### New Beijing Steamer Delayed Arrival to Shanghai

The Taikoo Company's North China route's new Beijing steamer, originally scheduled to return to Shanghai from Tianjin via Yantai yesterday, did not arrive as of late evening. It is rumored that the steamer was delayed for several days in Yantai due to quarantine by the Japanese, thus delaying its arrival in Shanghai as well. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai around tomorrow, and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Tianjin and Weihaiwei on the ninth. Jardine Matheson's Dongsheng steamer is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Tianjin and Yantai tomorrow (the eighth). As for the Shuntian steamer, which was supposed to be taken out of service on the North China line, passengers have already received ticket refunds, and cargo will also be unloaded within the day. As soon as unloading is complete, it will set sail south. The steamer is currently still docked at the Bund outside the French Concession's Rue du Consulat. The new Beijing steamer's wharf.

### French Concession Public Transportation to Resume Service Today

Salary Increase Issue Resolved Satisfactorily Last Night

According to reliable sources last night, the labor strike of the French-owned Water and Electricity Company's transportation vehicles has been resolved through the efforts of the French Police Political Department. It is reported that in addition to a general increase of 19 yuan per person, a further bonus will be added, effective from the date of the company's announcement. All workers were satisfied. Around 8:00 PM last night, hundreds of workers lined up to work in the factory. After the company officials explained everything, about eighty coppersmiths and machine operators on the night shift first entered the factory to wipe down the vehicles and add machine oil. The drivers and ticket sellers were instructed to return home first and report to the factory at dawn this morning. They then dispersed. A work slowdown has been declared resolved. All tramcars, trolleybuses, and bus lines 21 and 22 will fully resume service this morning.

### Power Company to Further Reduce Electricity by 30%

According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the Public Utilities Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement held a meeting in the Council Chamber at 4:30 PM on the 5th to discuss the Shanghai Power Company's request to implement a 30% restriction on electricity and the issue of charging fees for exceeding the electricity limit. Considering the company's dwindling coal reserves, the committee deemed that the 30% restriction on electricity could be approved. As for the charging method for exceeding the limit, it was decided to charge three times the normal electricity rate.

### Soviet-Japanese Military Clash Dismissed as a Misunderstanding by Japan

Claiming Minor Incidents Occur Occasionally

The North China Daily News reports that rumors of a clash between Soviet and Japanese troops near Manchuria about two weeks ago were confirmed by Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama, a spokesperson for the Japanese Army, at a press conference on the 5th. He stated that a small number of Soviet border guards crossed the border into Northeast China, and the two sides exchanged gunfire, with one Japanese soldier injured. Only four or five soldiers on each side fired their weapons, he said. Akiyama also stated that similar minor incidents had occurred in the border area for several years, but both the Soviet and Japanese sides considered them insignificant and did not deem it necessary to submit them to arbitration. The reason for the repeated small clashes is that there are many unclear demarcation points between the Soviet Union and the Manchurian frontier, leading to misunderstandings. Senior authorities are aware of this. Regarding the recent clash, there were many rumors in Shanghai, but in reality, this matter is not worth paying attention to, he said. When asked if the rumors of a widespread withdrawal of Japanese troops in China, leading to a major offensive by the Chinese army, could be believed, Akiyama replied that if the Japanese were truly withdrawing their troops, it would be a good opportunity for the Chinese army to launch a major offensive, but there is currently no sign of such an offensive.

### Passengers Should Cooperate Ethically to Eliminate the Bad Habit of Embezzlement

Should Insist on Receiving Tickets Equal to the Value Paid; Street Loafers Colluding with the Company Should be Strictly Investigated

The bad habit of public bus ticket sellers taking fares without issuing tickets has existed for a long time. Various parties have expressed concern about this. It is difficult to get the company to find a way to eliminate this bad habit or improve the treatment of ticket sellers. However, some passengers have the misguided mentality of not caring about the ticket sellers' bad habits. In fact, as the saying goes, "the wool comes from the sheep." If the company's income is insufficient for its budget, it will have to raise prices to make up for it. The ones who directly suffer losses are still the passengers. Knowing this, it can be seen that not caring about the ticket sellers' bad habits will inevitably lead to direct losses and indirectly encourage unethical behavior. As for the ticket sellers' low wages, if they are indeed insufficient to cover expenses, they can make reasonable demands to the company, which will surely receive the support of the public.

Ticket Seller Treatment is Not Meager

This newspaper recently received a letter from the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramways Company stating that the company is deeply concerned about the situation and wishes to declare that it has made every effort to eliminate the bad habits of ticket sellers. The wages of ticket sellers cannot be said to be meager. It is also stipulated that ticket sellers with good behavior will receive special year-end allowances as encouragement. The company has a total of 879 ticket sellers on duty each day and 171 Chinese, British, Russian, and Korean ticket inspectors who board the buses at any time to check tickets, an average of one ticket inspector for every five ticket sellers.

Eagerly Awaiting Active Cooperation from Passengers

The company is now posting notices about fares on all buses. If passengers actively cooperate and insist on receiving tickets equal to the value they paid, then the ticket sellers will not be able to practice their bad habits. To give an example, when buying a pack of cigarettes or other items, everyone wants to get goods equal to the price paid. Shouldn't it be the same when riding a tram? Therefore, it is hoped that passengers will insist on receiving new tickets of equal value after paying the fare.

People with Good Behavior Also Exist

There is no shortage of ticket sellers with good behavior. If the public can actively cooperate, it will be possible to gradually eliminate bad habits. Furthermore, the company is also steadily cracking down on street loafers who collude with ticket sellers and notify them of the location of ticket inspectors. The company has dispatched personnel to patrol and arrest loafers who report information.

### Sir Victor Sassoon Departed Shanghai for Bombay Yesterday

Scheduled to Return to Shanghai at the End of the Year

Sir Victor Sassoon, a financial magnate in Shanghai, made important statements regarding the international situation after recently returning to Shanghai from the United States. It is learned that Sir Sassoon departed Shanghai for Bombay, India last night. The date of his return to Shanghai is expected to be at the end of this year.

### Some Jews in Hongkou to Be Deported by the Japanese; Investigating So-Called "Undesirable Elements;" No Consideration Yet Given to How to Resettle Them

According to the North China Daily News, a Japanese Navy spokesperson stated yesterday (the 5th) at a press conference that the Japanese authorities are seriously studying the possibility of deporting a certain percentage of Jewish refugees in areas under Japanese control. As a result of the study, some undesirable Jews may be deported. When this will be implemented is not yet known.

The internal motive for this move by the Japanese authorities, which is so-called stabilizing Hongkou's security, is related to stabilizing the lives of Jews north of the Suzhou Creek. Many Jews, mostly undesirable elements, seem to have infiltrated Hongkou without the necessary permits, affecting rent and food prices in the Jewish area. The Japanese authorities fear that Hongkou's security will be disturbed by this, so they plan to deport all undesirable elements to seek the welfare of general Jewish refugees. The deportation of undesirable elements will be carried out by the Jewish Community Association and will not be done by force.

General Jewish Community Greatly Shocked; When asked where the deported undesirable Jews will go after being deported from Hongkou, the spokesperson replied that the authorities have not yet considered this. Regarding this matter, Samuel Moiseiwitsch, editor of the Shanghai "Far Eastern Economic Review," a Jewish publication, has submitted a written protest to the Japanese authorities, opposing it. According to Moiseiwitsch, the news that the Japanese will deport "undesirable" Jewish refugees from Hongkou and Huishan districts has greatly shocked the Jewish community.

Japanese Actively Conducting Investigations; The Shanghai Jewish Chronicle had previously published a report foreshadowing this move by the Japanese. According to the report, the Japanese Marine Corps has invited some Jews, such as the newspaper's editor, Levin, to form a subcommittee to work with the Japanese Marine Corps to eliminate "undesirable elements." In addition to reporting to the Japanese on whether certain Jewish refugees are good, the subcommittee will also immediately deport Jews residing in Hongkou without permits after the investigation is completed.

Unilateral Actions Are Illegal; Moiseiwitsch continued, stating that he can declare on behalf of the 11,300 Jewish refugees in Hongkou that those who have formed a subcommittee at the request of the Japanese authorities do not have the qualifications to represent the entire Jewish community of Hongkou. Moreover, most of them do not reside in Hongkou and have not consulted with other Jewish leaders. Furthermore, the actions that the Japanese authorities intend to take are illegal because they have not consulted with the Municipal Council (Hongkou is part of the International Settlement) or any organization launched by the Jewish community in Shanghai. He believes that if this unilateral action is implemented, it will make the situation in Shanghai even more tense.

Approximately 4,000 People Without Permits; Furthermore, according to the English-language China Press, regarding the Japanese Navy spokesperson's statement that they intend to deport unregistered, undesirable Jews from Hongkou, the Municipal Council and the Jewish Refugee Committee are currently waiting for the Japanese authorities to take formal steps and therefore cannot take any countermeasures. It is widely believed that there are currently approximately 4,000 Jews living in Hongkou without Japanese permits, but many of them arrived in Shanghai before the Japanese implemented the permit system, and most of them cannot find accommodation elsewhere in the city. Therefore, if the Japanese authorities deport these Jews, it will only increase the difficulties in the city.

### Hurricane Season Approaching

The Jianghai Customs has announced that the hurricane season this year has also arrived. To ensure the safety of outgoing ships, starting today, if a hurricane threatens Shanghai, warning balls and red lights will continue to be hung on the Bund and on the roofs of the Customs House.

A new hurricane has formed in the Pacific Ocean and is continuing to move rapidly northwest, posing a serious threat to the Chinese coast. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 6:00 AM yesterday, the hurricane is currently located at 21 degrees north latitude and 134 degrees east longitude, moving northwest. The center of the storm is within 60 nautical miles. Also, starting today, the tidal surge in the Huangpu River will reach its maximum level. According to the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau's forecast, it will reach 12 feet 6 and a half inches, less than 4 inches from the Bund embankment.

### U.S. Policy on Evacuation Remains the Same, but the Situation Has Not Changed; Those with Important Missions May Still Reside; Clear Statement from Secretary of State Hull

According to news reports from the day before yesterday (the 5th), U.S. Secretary of State Hull recently stated that the U.S. government had long ago urged Americans in the Far East to evacuate back to the country on ships passing through. Americans in Shanghai were somewhat surprised by this news, as Secretary of State Hull's statement seemed to indicate that there had been a change in the evacuation policy. The English-language China Press received numerous phone calls from Americans inquiring about this matter, so they telegraphed their editor, Gold, who is currently in the United States, last night to inquire about everything.

No Intention of a Complete Evacuation

Shortly after receiving the reply telegram, it was learned that the evacuation policy still only applies to "non-essential" Americans. Gold's telegram stated that he spoke with senior officials at the State Department, who assured him, "There has been no change to the U.S. evacuation policy announced last October and reiterated in February. Despite recent developments in the Far East, Washington has confirmed that the basic position remains unchanged. Therefore, the evacuation notice remains the same and still only applies to non-essential Americans, while Americans with necessary missions may still reside in the Far East." Hull's informal remarks yesterday were only intended to reiterate the previously issued evacuation notice, not to modify or expand it, he said. According to reports, after returning to the United States in May, Gold had several long talks with State Department officials, and based on the information he obtained, he wrote an article stating that the U.S. government did not intend to urge all Americans in the Far East to evacuate, but only wanted women, children, and men who did not believe it necessary to stay in the Far East to return to the United States. The U.S. government is very willing to "keep the flag flying," he said.

Americans in Japan Will Soon Return Home; Furthermore, according to U.S. official sources, the U.S. government now intends to dispatch ships to Japan to transport 654 Americans stranded in Japan back to the country. These expatriates were unable to return home because Japan suspended shipping to the United States. As for Americans residing in Shanghai, the original number was around 4,000 to 5,000. Since the evacuation began last autumn, about half of them have returned home one after another. As for the ships, a large number of the evacuating expatriates returned home on three ships specially dispatched by the U.S. government. Later, they successively boarded the Pacific Line ships of the United States Mail Steamship Company to leave Shanghai. The U.S. government once considered dispatching another special ship to the Far East to evacuate expatriates, but because ordinary shipping had not been interrupted due to the changes in the situation, and almost all non-essential expatriates had been evacuated, there was no need to dispatch another ship. Currently, only a small number of women and children are preparing to continue the evacuation.

### Field Visit Report of Scholarship Applicants

This newspaper's Reader Scholarship Fund has received enthusiastic support from all sectors of society, with donations flowing in to provide relief to poor students and nurture talent. This has inspired us to work even harder to ensure that the application process is thorough and complete, so as not to disappoint the kindness of people from all walks of life. Applications closed on the 5th (the rules originally stipulated that the application deadline was the 10th, but because schools were about to open and some had already started collecting fees, it was necessary to bring the deadline forward to cope with the actual situation and expedite the process so that applicants could focus on their studies).

The visiting work began before the application deadline and has been stepped up in recent days, with staff dispatched to applicants' homes to conduct field investigations. Although the sun has been blazing for days and the staff are sweating profusely, coupled with the strike of vehicles in the French Concession, the staff are moving forward with a hundred times the spirit, braving the scorching sun, looking for alleys, running back and forth, not only do they not feel bitter, but they also feel the importance of the mission they bear!

As for what has been learned in the visiting process, to be reported to the public and the families of applicants: (1) Are the items filled in on the application form accurate and reliable? (2) Is the applicant's family really poor? (3) The applicant's family size and their economic life situation. (4) The applicant's parent's or guardian's occupation and regular income. (5) If the applicant's family came to Shanghai to escape the war, what assets do they have in their hometown and what is the production situation? (6) Are the applicant's parents kind to their children? (7) Does the parent have any bad habits? (8) Is the school the applicant intends to attend after the summer vacation certain? (9) The applicant's words, actions, appearance and character. (10) Pay attention to the strictness of schools at all levels, as well as the leniency and strictness of the scoring system; the grading of schools in Shanghai at all levels varies widely, and some schools grade very leniently, so even if the grades listed on the report card are very good, they must be carefully considered. Regarding these ten points, applicants and their parents should be as sincere as possible and provide convenience to this newspaper's staff in their visits, so as not to disappoint the sincerity of the society and this newspaper in helping students.

The Son of a Maid

When I started my first scholarship visit, it was in the hottest weather of 98.5 degrees. Filled with excitement and new hopes, I thought to myself, I am going on an adventure to the metropolis of Shanghai, where the cost of living is so high, which will allow me to discover many inspiring lifestyles, many outstanding young people who feel that tuition fees are difficult to raise and are wandering and sad! My heart was unconsciously filled with sympathy and smiles because of the tension. The compassion that society has given us, we will give back to society.

That day, my destination was the extremely remote areas of the French Concession, including Route Tenant de la Tour, Avenue Petain, and Avenue de Ziccawei. According to the predetermined route, the first interviewee was at a certain address on Route Tenant de la Tour. According to the application form, it was just a mother and son, with the occupation of servant and an income of only four yuan. I had already determined that the house number was the residence of his mother's employer. It was a tall, three-story lane house. As I walked up the first flight of stone steps, asking for the Ji family, a 14- or 15-year-old boy, accompanied by a fair-looking child of six or seven years old, responded. The older boy told me that he was the one I was going to visit. He told me in detail about his life situation in response to my questions.

He is a 14-year-old boy and now studies at Jinghong Elementary School, which is opposite his residence. He is only in the fourth grade after the summer vacation. This is a spring class because he dropped out of school for a year in the middle. His mother works as a "Niangyi" (maid) at the residence and earns only four yuan. She used to work at a factory on Meizhou Road, and he also studied at a primary school on Meizhou Road. When the war broke out, his mother lost her job, and he also dropped out of school. Later, his mother relied on housework to make a living, raising her only son with great care. He followed his mother to help with odd jobs at the employer's house, without pay, only seeking accommodation and food so as not to drift around helplessly. His ancestral home is Chongming, where they have a flat house and three mu of thin fields, rented out to others, with very little income. The mother and son have not returned to their hometown for seven years. He plans to study business after graduating from elementary school.

When I visited him, it was about 11:00 AM. His mother was cooking downstairs for her employer and did not meet me. The other little employer was always watching my Q&A with this older boy. I asked him, do you find our conversation interesting? He was silent. A middle-aged or older returned person, presumably the mistress of the house, raised her voice and asked me what was going on. I told her that I had come to help poor children study. She glanced at me and turned to go into the room. I saw that the bedroom had sofas and Western-style decorations, and it was quite clean.

### Hongkou Japanese Naval Garrison District Prohibits Passage

Bridges Along the Suzhou Creek Locked Down; Passage Prohibited Without a Quarantine Certificate

According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, due to the recent series of cases of genuine cholera in the Hongkou area, the Japanese authorities have established vaccination stations at five locations, including the Garden Bridge, Zhapu Road Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, and Xinzha Road Bridge, starting on the 5th of this month. These stations will provide vaccinations to passersby from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day. As for the naval garrison area north of the Suzhou Creek, passage is absolutely prohibited. On the morning of the 5th, the Japanese Marines, the Japanese Consulate Police Station, and the Xingya Yuan's Central China Liaison Department stationed personnel at places such as the Garden Bridge to check pedestrians. Those who held a vaccination certificate were allowed to pass, while others were not allowed to pass. They had to wait until the vaccination began in the afternoon and be vaccinated by the Japanese authorities before they could pass. Therefore, the order on each bridge at that time was extremely chaotic.

### Epidemic of Dysentery in this City; Residents Urged to Pay Attention to Health Preservation

Cholera in Hongkou Still Rampant; According to news from the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, since the second half of June, the hospital has admitted 65 patients with genuine cholera. Of these, 12 have died, 27 have recovered and been discharged, and the rest are still under treatment. Divided by the patients' residential areas, 24 are from the French Concession, 7 from Nanshi Zhabei, and 35 from the Public Concession. The Public Concession accounts for more than half. It is claimed that the hospital has also recently discovered multiple cases of smallpox and meningitis, which have been sent to the isolation hospitals of the two concessions for medical treatment due to equipment issues. As for private hospitals, it is impossible to count. In addition, some patients go directly to the isolation hospitals of the concessions for treatment, so the number of patients is believed to be more than this number. Currently, the hospital's outpatient clinic receives more than 600 people per day, and the number is increasing daily, which is worthy of attention. Residents are urged to take good care of their health. As for the Hongkou district under Japanese control, although it has been repeatedly disinfected, cases continue to occur. It is learned that on the evening of the 3rd of this month, a crew member of the Japanese-owned Huazhong Water Transportation's ship Dazesumaru, a Japanese man named Matsuo Toshio, suddenly contracted a suspected case of cholera. He was immediately sent to the Tongrenhui Baziqiao Branch, admitted, and isolated. The examination results confirmed that it was genuine cholera. It is reported that as of the 5th of this month, there were a total of 79 patients with genuine cholera in Shanghai.

### Fishery in Ningbo Plummeted After the Fall of Ningbo; The Japanese Authorities Forbid Fishing in the Sea

The fishery in Eastern Zhejiang has traditionally been most abundant in the counties under Ningbo's jurisdiction, and a large number of residents are engaged in fishing. According to people in the fishing industry, the Ningbo fishery has always been managed by the authorities. Fishing belonged to the Yin County Fishing Association, transportation belonged to the Yongfeng Public Office, and sales belonged to the Fresh and Salted Goods Industry Association. Since the fall of Ningbo, the management agencies and groups have withdrawn one after another, resulting in a lack of control. In addition, the Japanese have blockaded various small ports and prohibited fishing boats from going to sea, causing the fishery to plummet. Statistics show that before the war, there were more than 1,500 fishing boats of various types. Now, except for a small number left in Chuanshan, which can still fish, the rest are either prohibited from going to sea or converted into passenger ships, which accounts for the majority of the total. Many were also innocently attacked and sunk or burned. Therefore, the current Ningbo fishery is only one-tenth of what it was before the war. Most of the fresh fish shops can barely maintain their expenses. Transportation and sales to Shanghai have been severely affected due to transportation inconveniences.

### Rowdy Prostitutes Forcibly Solicit Customers and Gang Up to Commit Assaults, Leaving Two Victims Injured and 29 Arrested at the Scene

Huang Zhicai, an accountant at the Quanxingkang Restaurant on Zhejiang Road, finished his work at around 12:00 AM the other day and was walking north towards home. While passing the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Ningbo Road, he was suddenly accosted by prostitutes Wang Xiuying and Zhang Chenshi, who forcibly dragged him into the nearby Guanghua Fang alley, forcing him to stay at Wang's residence. Huang firmly resisted.

Ultimately overpowered, Huang was noticed by Chai Dakang and Liu Awu, two associates from Quanxingkang, who were passing by. They intervened to help. Unexpectedly, the prostitutes gathered many members from the Cantonese-run Yinglian Sports Association at 482 Zhejiang Road (where Wang the prostitute also lived). Armed with knives and sticks, they surrounded Huang, Chai, and Liu, and closed the iron gate at the entrance of Guanghua Fang alley, preventing outside assistance from reaching Huang and his companions. They then severely beat the three men, resulting in Chai and Liu

both sustaining knife wounds. Liu's injuries were more serious, while Huang suffered only superficial wounds. Upon receiving a report, the Lao Zha police station promptly dispatched Detective Ong Hongxun, Detectives Huang Cifu and Chen Junfeng, and Western Constable No. 75. They arrested Wang the prostitute, the prostitute's servant Zhang Chenshi, and Yinglian members Leng Dejin, Zhang Bolin, Wang Jinbiao, Chen Shisheng, Chen Weisheng, Ou Fusheng, and others, totaling 29 individuals. Three firelocks, four broadswords, and six sticks were confiscated. When the detectives were

making the arrests, some individuals attempted to flee, leading to a conflict with Western Constable No. 75. During the struggle, the constable's firearm accidentally discharged, striking a passerby named Xue Bingrong in the leg. The detectives then took the 29 individuals to the police station and transported the injured to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the Fifth Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Peng Qixin requested detention pending investigation and prosecution. After questioning by Judge Shen, the order was given to detain them for further questioning at a later date.

### Baodaxiang Store on Eight Immortals Bridge Thrown With a Bomb Yesterday, Leaving Five Employees Injured, One Severely

Yesterday afternoon at approximately 3:50 PM, the Baodaxiang Silk and Cloth Store, located at No. 10, Avenue Dubail, diagonally opposite the Golden Grand Theatre in the French Concession, was bustling with customers when suddenly a man threw a hand grenade into the store. With a loud bang and a puff of thick smoke, five employees immediately fell to the ground, injured. One person was struck in the abdomen by shrapnel and severely wounded, with bloodstains all over the floor. The customers scattered and fled, creating a chaotic scene. The bomber took advantage of the chaos to escape without a trace. Upon receiving the report, the French police immediately dispatched a large number of detectives and patrol officers to the scene, sending the injured to Guangci Hospital for treatment. They also collected fragments of the bomb and took them back to the police station for examination in order to track down the perpetrator. It is reported that the silk and cloth store is quite prosperous and has repeatedly received threatening letters, which have been quite intense.

### Major Fire in Pudong Destroys Over a Hundred Shanties

In the Nantao Clay Pond area at the southern end of Daxin Street, Lao Baidu, Pudong, there are over 500 shanties, closely packed together like pigeon cages. They are all inhabited by poor migrant workers who rely on stevedoring and rowing boats for a living. They usually lack fire-fighting equipment, so once a fire breaks out, it is impossible to control. Yesterday at 11:05 AM, a fire broke out in the shanty of Fei Lu, a woman from Yancheng, at number 459, due to carelessness while cooking lunch. In an instant, sparks flew everywhere, and the fire spread rapidly due to the strong wind. At that time, the tide was low, and the creek was dry. Most of the men were out working, leaving only women and children at home, making it impossible to draw water to put out the fire. It was not extinguished until 2:00 PM. A total of over 140 thatched shacks were destroyed, and the cries of the more than one hundred affected households were unbearable. No fatalities were reported in the incident, but the true picture will only be clear after all the residents return home in the evening. It is said that no fewer than a thousand people were left homeless and sleeping in the open last night, a truly terrible calamity.

### Two Women Commit Suicide by Poisoning

They again arrested Tan Zuomin, He Sheng, Liu Zemin, Tang Yong, He Rong, and Hu Zao, and confiscated many large and small gambling tablecloths and chips. Yesterday morning, they were all handed over to the Fifth Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Peng Qixin filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law. After questioning by Judge Shen, he ordered that the fourteen gamblers be fined ten yuan each as a warning, and that the remaining twelve gambling bosses and organizers be detained for further questioning at a later date.

### Attempt to Pawn Fake Gold Jewelry Detected, Arrest Made

Guo Zhangshi, a 30-year-old woman from Beiping living at No. 44, Suzou Road in Western Shanghai, took a pair of fake gold bracelets on the afternoon of the other day to the Yongxing Pawnshop at No. 349, Route Lartigue in the French Concession, intending to pawn them for 20 yuan. She was detected by a shop employee Zhang Maohong, who called the police and had her arrested. Two more pairs of the same fake gold bracelets were found on her person. Brought to the police station, she confessed that she specialized in pawning fake gold jewelry, having previously pawned items at the Shunchang Pawnshop on Quinsan Road and the Shengyuan Pawnshop on Rue Amiral Bayle. The police chief dispatched detectives to summon the relevant parties to the station to identify Guo, who was confirmed to be the culprit. The police chief, considering her to be a repeat offender of fraud, ordered her detention pending further investigation and prosecution.

### Buddhist Benevolent Society Provides Emergency Relief in Nanshi, 80,000 Residents on the Brink of Starvation, Hope for Donations of Dry Food and Medicine from All Sectors

Since the blockade of Nanshi, residents have been prohibited from entering or leaving, and it has been impossible to purchase daily necessities, causing great panic in their lives. Yesterday, the Buddhist Benevolent Society sent members to investigate. It was learned that in the area bounded by Fanghong Road to the south, Minguo Road to the north, Xiaoshijie to the east, and Nanyang Bridge to the west, there are as many as 80,000 residents.

### Searching One's Heart

‚Äî Xiao Yun

Given the significant impact of literary and artistic works on readers, a literary writer should, before putting pen to paper, search their heart (conscience!) and ask themselves: Why do I want to write this? What impact will this work have on the reader? What impact do I want this work to have on the reader?

Writers who write for art's sake, writers who see art as a pastime, writers who see literary works as fulfilling personal creative desires, may not want to bother with these questions. They simply want to narrate the story in their minds, and are content as long as the depiction is moving. They have no grand plans, no clear goals; they create for the sake of creating.

However, this is useless. Whether they plan or not, their works will inevitably have a good or bad influence on the readership. This is, of course, directly related to the author's outlook on life and the world, but we will not discuss these for the time being. We simply want to point out a bare fact: whether you admit it or not, a literary work will ultimately have a tangible or intangible, good or bad influence on the reader, and the power over this good or bad influence lies in the hands of the literary writer, and should be the responsibility of the writer themselves.

We hope that every writer will take out their already published works and examine them in detail. For meaningless, numbing, or toxic works, distribution should be stopped immediately. For future works, we hope that every conscientious literary writer will search their heart and ask: What impact will this work have on the reader? What impact do I want this work to have on the reader?

Psychology

### How to Eliminate Anger?

‚Äî Liang

Humans are emotional animals, and "joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness" are emotional expressions resulting from external stimuli. People who lack self-cultivation are most easily agitated, which is extremely harmful to one's body. But how can an ordinary person cultivate their emotions? This is indeed a difficult question. You may find many tips for self-cultivation in the books of ancient sages, but with so many ideas, where do you start?

The expression of "anger" is the most undesirable of all emotions. Only those with the highest self-cultivation can easily avoid getting angry often. If someone hits you for no reason, would you not be enraged? Regardless of the direct impact of this "rage" on your body, the important point is how do you eliminate this "rage"? You might scold the person, or even retaliate, but if your anger still hasn't dissipated, then what force will you use to eliminate it? This should be rather interesting.

The person who has studied "anger" most thoroughly is probably Dr. Ruokin Young, an American psychologist, who has devoted himself to the study of the psychology of "anger" for seventeen years. He believes that anger has more harm than good for people; fortunately, all anger can be eliminated by methods. The classification of anger is not based on the degree of anger, nor on the cause of anger, nor on the state of anger, but on the duration of anger. The first type is "latent anger;" for example, a deep hatred, anger in the heart, long-standing, initially not expressed, but later erupting when it becomes unbearable. The second type is "instant anger;" for example, suffering injustice, immediately erupting in anger, unrelated to anything in the past. The third type is "after-the-fact anger;" for example, anger that does not erupt at the time, but leaves behind a kind of "self-pitying" emotion. If we represent them with numbers: 1, 2, 3 representing the degree of anger, with each type of anger represented by a number representing its stage, then the first type is: "1, 2, 3," the second type is: "0, 0, 3," and the third type is: "3, 2, 1." These three different types of anger each have different impacts. According to Yang's conclusions from precise experiments, the time it takes for a person to recover mentally after the three types of anger is in the ratio of 2:1:3. As for the direct impact of anger on a person, it can be expressed by lifting power. The first type of anger can increase a person's lifting power by one-half; the second type of anger can suddenly increase it by more than double; and the third type of anger reduces it by one-quarter. Yang pointed out that the increased lifting power during anger is not something to celebrate, because the impact of anger on the brain nerves is very serious. Yang gave an example: if a person cannot distinguish between orange-red, rose-red, and dark red during normal anger, then that person's brain has suffered a blow of 85 pounds. If, when angry, one feels dizzy and cannot see or hear, then the impact is even greater! Not only is their behavior like madness.

At this time, the most important thing is how to eliminate anger after it has already erupted? Yang believes that with the development of modern science, it may be possible to clear anger with some kind of physical machine. But before a physical machine is invented, it is still more effective to use psychological power. When the first type of anger erupts, reading biographies of great people, famous historical accounts, or recalling stories of great people, historical events, etc., has a peculiar effect on eliminating anger. After the second type of anger occurs, one should quickly leave the current environment, paying special attention to another matter, shifting all mental energy to it, or putting all effort into searching and studying something of particular interest to oneself, which can make anger go away very quickly. Regarding the third type of anger, the gentleness of music and the elegance of paintings are the most effective remedies; even the deepest anger can certainly be eliminated by this means. The above are the methods that Yang believes are most effective and easiest for ordinary people to do. As for the fact that the methods of eliminating anger vary greatly depending on each person's environment, personality, thoughts, and level of education, Yang has given 67 different types of people, each with their own method of eliminating anger, but in general, in principle, it is based on the above methods, and the results obtained after rigorous and detailed experimentation.

Indeed, humans are emotional animals, and emotional expression is inevitable; but to cultivate oneself to the point of suppressing anger and not being moved is indeed not easy. However, if anger has already erupted, quickly eliminating it oneself, this "mending the fold after the sheep have been lost" method is not unworthy of praise!

Life

### Three Stages of Life

‚Äî Xin Liang

Every life should have three stages:

(1) Education Stage: In this stage, one should make the most of their time and energy to acquire the best knowledge.

(2) Building a Career Stage: After acquiring knowledge, one must go into society to establish a career. One should strive to be a "person"; at the same time, one should plot the greatest happiness for oneself and one's family.

(3) Serving Society Stage: This stage is the most important stage of life, which determines its success or failure and its greatness. One should know that all the money and property one has obtained is given to them by this society, so one must not only care about the comfort of one's own life, but also enable others to live a fulfilling life. Many, many people have failed because they have neglected this point. They have already obtained a lot of money in the previous stage, but they are still not satisfied and are still greedy. They have all forgotten how to repay this society that once cultivated and helped them.

Before leaving this world, everyone should sow some beneficial seeds in this world, so that it grows more beautiful and so that those who live on it can live a more peaceful and happier life. (Original by Edward Bok)

War

### Food for Air Defense Personnel

‚Äî Li Yi

Most of the barrage balloons defending London are moored in the suburbs of London. Due to the remote location and liaison duties, the air defense personnel cannot cook for themselves. The British military authorities organized a central kitchen to prepare food for them, which was delivered by couriers on bicycles. The food, including vegetables, meat, and candy, was packaged in square boxes and transported on bicycles with smaller front wheels for distances of two to ten miles, and distributed to the air defense personnel.

### Autumn Begonia

"I'm just afraid it's too late, it's a pity to waste so much tuition!" She said very tactfully while sweeping the floor.

"You don't have to worry about the money, as long as you..."

Autumn Begonia had only spoken half a sentence when she heard a burst of footsteps outside the door. A round, silvery basin-like face was already poking in through the half-closed door. Even Mei Bao didn't have time to wink at her.

"Sister, come over and say a few words!" Meng Dajie, with her fast mouth, shouted impatiently before she even stopped.

"I'm sorry, there are still some small things at home, wait..." Mei Shi still wanted to use other words to prevaricate her, so as not to make everyone feel embarrassed by speaking bluntly on the spot.

But Autumn Begonia felt that this matter could no longer be ambiguous.

"Dajie, please sit for a while, can we talk for a few words?" He tried his best to keep his attitude and tone as gentle as usual, because he also understood that the little manager of the Meng family was a complete idiot. Her introducing Mei Shi to Shang Laoer to learn opera was indeed a purely good intention, so he absolutely didn't want to vent his anger on her.

Meng's daughter-in-law heard Autumn Begonia wanted to talk to her, so she immediately sat down with a grin on a square stool near the door, paying no more attention to the faces of the father and daughter.

"Uncle Wu, is the lotus root powder that I sent you last time finished? Do you want me to send you a few more boxes?" She babbled to Autumn Begonia, thinking she was very capable. (178)

Artistic Circles

### Recent Poetry Recitals

‚Äî Lao Bo

Although poetry recitals have been promoted for a long time, there have been very few opportunities for everyone to hear them, except for a few poets practicing on their own and occasionally giving a public recital. I heard that at the end of last year, the poets in Chongqing had organized poetry recital teams, preparing to divide into teams to recite in various rural areas, which caused a sensation for a while, but soon many people in the cultural circles left Chongqing, and the work of the poetry recital team seemed to stop imperceptibly.

There were three poetry recitals in Shanghai last year, one was the spring recital organized by the Xinglie Society, and the other two were held at the memorial meetings of the two great writers Gorky and Lu Xun, which seemed to have aroused some people's interest and attention. But since the beginning of this year, in the middle of half a year, I have not heard of any recitals being held. Until recently, we heard two poetry recitals again, which made me very interested.

These two poetry recitals did not seem to be the poets practicing recitation in the study and then making it public. On the contrary, the people who recited these two times were a few stage stars and young students. The poetry recital expanded beyond the small circle of poets, which is very beneficial to the development of poetry recitals.

The first time was on the 29th of last month, when the "Mainland Monthly" magazine used the literary broadcast of the Xinxin Glass Radio Station for the first time in Shanghai. In addition to the drama "The Proposal" broadcast by the Juyi Society, Chen Zhitong broadcast Zhang Tianyi's novel "Sloppy Love Story" and many valuable music programs, there was also Miss Lan Lan's recitation of Shelley's famous poem "Ode to the West Wind", and Miss Ye Jingzhen's recitation of Pushkin's famous poem "Farewell to My Homeland"; Miss Zhang Renli recited Ji Fang's original poem "Rose". Broadcasting from the air to every radio, when I received that clear voice, it did give me a very novel feeling.

The second time was the summer poetry recital held by the Lyra Literary Society, which was also held on the 3rd of this month in the auditorium of the YWCA. There were many programs, including the music programs participated by the Experimental Music Troupe, with no less than 30 items. Generally speaking, Miss Ban Zhuo's recitation of Aramaki's poem "Mother", Miss Ke Qing's recitation of Zhu Weiji's poem "Lu Xun's Birthday", Miss Shen Luo's recitation of Bai Shu's poem "Dust Blowing Under the Taihang Mountains", Han Liu's recitation of Xi Jin's poem "Evening Star", and Wu Huo's recitation of Pei Mafei's famous poems "Dog's Song" and "Wolf's Song" were better. However, the voices of many reciters were too low, and they lacked a grasp of language and poetry. In terms of results, it is clear that the many vocal programs of the Experimental Music Troupe overshadowed everything.

But this is not because the future of poetry recitation is not as brilliant as singing, it is precisely because poetry reciters also need to strengthen the practice of basic techniques such as pronunciation, articulation, rhythm, and emotion, just like musicians. I hope that with more attention and promotion from everyone, there will be a day when poetry recitation will be as popular among the people as storytelling and drum singing.

### The Future of Ji Yuliang

‚Äî Zhang Songran

At the end of last month, I went to the Golden Stage to see the complete "Wang Baochuan," focusing on the acts before "Chasing the Three Passes." The entire performance was passable. Apart from Yan Shishan and Ai Shiju, who were somewhat refreshing, the remaining performers were old and past their prime, not worth mentioning. Yan Shishan has the potential to become a star, with a good appearance and decent skills, without the bad habit of being perfunctory. If he can devote himself to studying other plays besides martial ones, he will be no match for Song Dezhu. Ai Shiju came to Shanghai with Mao Shilai and was diligent when he first joined the Golden Stage. His performances in plays like "Xiao Fang Bandit Hook" were excellent and well-received at the time. However, his performance has been declining, becoming increasingly sluggish. Could it be due to an unsuitable pairing or a lack of opportunity to showcase his talents? Nevertheless, as a basic actor in the Golden Stage, he is much better than Qiu Shengrong, who has resigned himself to obscurity.

Zheng Bingru, being a female impersonator, has many supporters. However, upon listening to her performance, I was greatly disappointed. Her pronunciation of tones was unclear, with too many entering tones. For example, she pronounced "ÂàÄ‰∏ãÁïô‰∫∫" (Spare his life) as "Âà∞‰∏ãÁïô‰∫∫" (Arrive and spare his life), making her spoken parts grating to the ear. Her "Er Liu" and "Liushui" melodies in "Da Deng Dian" were somewhat listenable, but apart from the main melodies, the words were unintelligible.

Finally, regarding Ji Yuliang, some say he is neither Tan nor Ma, while others say he completely imitates Ma and is not worth mentioning. However, in my opinion, although he is young, he still follows the rules. His singing, recitation, and lyrics are all mainstream, and his stage presence is also good. Only his pronunciation of stressed words slightly resembles Ma's lisp, which may be innate and not a serious flaw. I have a very good impression of him and hope that he will avoid Ma's shortcomings, adopt Tan's strengths, and follow Yang (Shisen)'s correct path. Within three years, he will surely surpass Xi Xiaobo and Guan Shaohua, or even exceed Wang Shaolou and Chen Shaolin.

Recently, Guo Chunyang, invited by the Golden Stage, suddenly stopped performing after three days due to illness. Ji Yuliang, who was originally second to Zheng Bingru, was promoted to the main role. Opportunity makes a hero. I sincerely rejoice and hope that Ji will make good use of this opportunity and improve himself. He should avoid being arrogant or lazy, and not imitate Ma's superficiality and self-importance, using novelty to dazzle people. He should also avoid Ma's head-shaking, hip-twisting, nasal humming, and lisp. Great expectations are placed on him.

### Golden Star and Meicheng Begin Cooperation

Starting August 1st, Golden Star Company has entered into a contract with Meicheng Film Studio to rent its studio facilities. Golden Star's new film "Peach Blossom Lake" has already begun production at Meicheng. Regarding the negotiation process, there have been many rumors about Yan Heming, the head of Meicheng, from the outside world. Some say that the conditions he proposed to Golden Star were quite harsh, but this is not accurate. Yan was formerly a colleague at the Star Film Company, and Zhou Jianyun, one of the heads of Golden Star, was also with the Star administration. They have a long-standing relationship of mutual understanding. Furthermore, Yan has long been known for his integrity in the film industry, so there is no reason for them to clash. According to Golden Star representatives, since moving into the Meicheng Film Studio, the cooperation has been very pleasant.

### Blood Rain in the Garden of Jade

‚Äî Gu Mingdao

Chapter XIV: Yuan Yuan's Small Characters in Delicate Silk

Generally, princes and nobles of the imperial clan, in their fine furs and horses, along with the children of elite families, would roam the lakes and seas, shooting slingshots and reciting poems, riding horses on Zhangtai Street. When banquets were held in the Garden of Jade, they would summon courtesans. The air would be filled with the fragrance of silk and the clinking of wine cups. It was truly like the extravagance of foreign emperors, with endless pleasure! Among the group of Wu girls, there was a beautiful woman, like an incarnation of a celestial being, named Chen Yuan, with the nickname Yuanyuan. She was originally from Yufeng. After falling into prostitution, her stunning beauty and elegance made her the leader among courtesans. Not only in the Jiangnan region, but even as far north as Youyan and as far south as Minyue, the name Chen Yuanyuan was on everyone's lips. One can imagine her intoxicating charm. However, as virtue rises, so does evil. At that time, there were many who coveted her, including wealthy merchants, noble young men, civil and military officials, gentry, and celebrities, all of whom considered it an honor to gain the favor of the beautiful woman. There was a licentious young man, surnamed Gao, who was adept at seeking pleasure with women. He had many concubines at home, but he always tired of the old and loved the new, abandoning them as quickly as he loved them. Everyone gave him the nickname "Flower Butterfly." Whenever Yuanyuan saw him coming to her dressing room, she would get a headache, often saying that his vulgarity made her want to vomit for three days. The Flower Butterfly was not unaware of his own shortcomings, but he was so enamored with Yuanyuan that he always wanted to pester her. Little did he know that the beautiful woman had a secret love in her heart. The affections of the heart, whether male or female, are spontaneous and inevitable. It is difficult to explain the cause and effect of this. Yuanyuan was in love with a young man from Qinghe in the city, nicknamed the "Pitying Jade Poet," who had made a blood oath with her. The poet was handsome, talented, and renowned for his writing style, which was as powerful as a tidal wave. His lyrics were exquisite and comparable to those of Liu Yong of the Song Dynasty. Yuanyuan admired his talent and loved his appearance, and her heart was completely captivated. Therefore, the Flower Butterfly regarded the poet as a thorn in his side, an enemy in the field of love who could hinder his success. Yuanyuan was not unaware that she was being envied, so she deliberately feigned illness and moved her residence to Hengtang to make it difficult for people to approach her. Little did she know that men like Dengtuzi would still come running at the first hint of her presence. How could Yuanyuan have a moment to breathe? But her foster mother had always intended to exploit this situation to make her a cash cow and reap the benefits. (135)
