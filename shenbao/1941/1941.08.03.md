### US President Issues Special Order Banning Oil Exports: Most Severe Blow to Japan Since the Start of the War; Petroleum Products Limited to Peacetime Export Levels

Washington, 1st – President Roosevelt issued an order this evening banning the export of all motor fuel oil and various oils suitable for aircraft to countries outside the Western Hemisphere, with the exception of the British Empire and the unoccupied areas of other countries resisting aggression. Although Japan was not mentioned in the order, authoritative sources told reporters that the President's ban was clearly aimed at Japan and would be the most severe blow to Japan since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. The government's policy on gasoline exports to Japan has reached its peak with the publication of this order, and public opinion across the United States is generally satisfied.

Washington, 2nd (United Press) – Without any prior special announcement, Japan will no longer be able to obtain machine oil and aircraft oil from the United States. President Roosevelt has banned the export of all machine oil and various oils usable in aircraft, as well as all raw materials for machine oil, to foreign countries, except for the Western Hemisphere, the British Empire, and the unoccupied countries resisting aggression. Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, expressed great satisfaction with Roosevelt's move. Dr. Hu Shih stated, "I believe this action will strengthen our morale and will be of great benefit to democratic countries fighting for freedom." Previously, all exports of American aircraft oil and machine oil required export licenses, but now they are all under control. The White House announcement stated, "President Roosevelt has instructed the Export Control Administrator to begin implementing a ban on gasoline exports for the sake of national defense. This action will have two effects: (1) The export of machine fuel, oils suitable for aircraft, and certain oil-producing raw materials will be prohibited to areas outside the Western Hemisphere, the British Empire, and other unoccupied countries resisting aggression. (2) The export of other gasoline production, except to the above-mentioned areas, will be limited to regular or pre-war quantities, and notes will be issued proportionally."

Washington, 2nd (United Press) – President Roosevelt yesterday implemented a de facto embargo on all motor fuel and lubricating oil to Japan. Authoritative sources here believe this is another blow to Japan's war machine. Although the U.S. President's move was clearly aimed at Japan, it did not mention Japan by name. The U.S. President's special order mandates that the current embargo on aviation fuel and oil must be implemented strictly, and a mechanism will be established to implement embargoes on all other types of gasoline and oil at will. Therefore, when it is deemed necessary to impose an absolute embargo, Japan's remaining oil supply will be cut off immediately. A spokesman for the administration declared that the motive for this order was based on reliable information that German and Japanese bombers were using inferior aviation gasoline, even lower than what the U.S. President had already embargoed. Roosevelt will continue to allow oil shipments to Japan to maintain its non-military industries, that is, to limit the export of other petroleum products to the normal quantities before the war, and export notes must be issued. An export administration spokesman said that Japan and other designated countries can obtain special oils, such as group oils used in stoves, but the quantity is limited to industrial needs and will be determined according to the President's wishes. If Japan insists on engaging in aggressive adventures in East Asia, the President can refuse to issue export notes, thereby depleting Japan's oil supply and bringing its industry to a standstill.

Tokyo, 2nd (Reuters) – Well-informed observers claim that the U.S. order banning the export of automobile and aircraft oil, although not explicitly mentioning Japan, is in fact aimed at Japan. Japan's aviation industry can depend on something other than the lubricating oil supplied by the United States. Currently, vegetable oil has been successfully used to replace aircraft oil through special methods, accounting for 90% of the oil consumption. Therefore, Japan will not feel immediate inconvenience from the U.S. restrictions on oil. However, if the United States insists on putting Japan in difficulty, the situation may be fraught with dangerous possibilities. Although the above remarks did not mention the Dutch East Indies, the Minister of Commerce and Industry stated last night that the international situation is quite tense, and even a spark could ignite a prairie fire.

Ottawa, 1st (Havas) – It was recently announced by the authorities that the Canadian Federation will take economic measures parallel to those of Britain and the United States against Japan. Kerosene that has not yet been shipped due to waiting for special passports is still being shelved, and the government has not yet taken any action on it.

### Japan Does Not Wish to Risk Rupture with Britain and the United States; Is Seeking to Ease Tensions with the United States

Tokyo, 2nd (Reuters) – Subtle but not meaningless developments in the past few days indicate that Japan is still unwilling to risk a complete rupture with Britain and the United States. Foreign Minister Koki Hirota, after returning from London, met with Prime Minister Konoe for the first time for two hours. This conversation was probably related to Konoe's doubts expressed on Wednesday about the final outcome of the U.S.-German war and its impact on Japan. Another noteworthy matter is the essay published by Finance Minister Ogura in the Nikkan Shimbun. Ogura stated plainly that although Japan has needs in the economic sphere, it is not yet in a position to provoke Britain and the United States without preparedness. Moreover, after the bombing of the U.S. gunboat in Chongqing, Japan quickly apologized to the United States, even though it knew it was an act of weakness, it still did so quickly. This also raises speculation that Japan does not dare to break with Britain and the United States, although Japan's inclination towards the Axis powers has not weakened in the slightest.

### US Government Orders Freeze on Silk Stocks

Washington, 2nd (United Press) – The Department of Commerce announced yesterday that all silk stocks in the United States will be frozen from midnight on Saturday. The Department of Commerce also notified representatives of the silk industry union in Washington that due to the situation in the Far East, they could no longer compete with the military in the supply of silk for public use.

Washington, 2nd (Havas) – Seventy-five thousand American silk weaving factories will be completely shut down due to the government's order prohibiting the use of raw silk. The government issued this ban at the request of the Departments of the Army and Navy. It is estimated that domestic raw silk stocks are only sufficient for two years of military and industrial use.

Tokyo, 1st (Havas) – According to reliable sources in neutral countries, the governments of the United States and Japan are currently conducting explorations through diplomatic channels, attempting to find a temporary solution to ease tensions between the two sides to some extent. Participants in the negotiations are said to have two goals: one economic and one political. Regarding the former, it is proposed to flexibly manage the current freeze measures to ensure that a considerable amount of trade between countries along the Pacific coast can still be restored. Regarding the latter, it is hoped to find a solution to prevent the relationship between the United States and Japan from deteriorating again, as both sides know that if the European war were to expand to the Far East, it would not be beneficial to either country. It is said that the United States and Japan notified Germany of these negotiations, and it is rumored that the United States has already accepted the economic part. If so, Britain and its allies will inevitably follow suit. However, it is said that the United States and Britain have firmly opposed the political part. In general, the agreement recently reached between France and Japan on the Vietnam issue has caused a bad reaction in Britain and France, and Japan seems to have underestimated this reaction. Therefore, regarding this matter, even if there is a possibility of preventing it from expanding in fact in the future, it can never be confirmed through a diplomatic agreement in law. In short, all these points can be fully understood once Mr. Wakasugi, the right-hand man of Ambassador Nomura to the United States, returns from the United States.

### Japanese Troops Continuously Arriving in Vietnam; Japanese Warships Also in Cam Ranh Bay

Saigon, 2nd (United Press) – A Japanese cruiser arrived here this morning for a visit of several days. Since Tuesday, Japanese transport ships have been arriving here in a steady stream. Japanese troops are being transported to their barracks by truck and are not patrolling the streets of the city. Japanese troops have brought in large quantities of gasoline and large bombs. Japanese military aircraft are parked at the airport because the hangars cannot fully accommodate them.

Tokyo, 2nd (Reuters) – Saigon Japanese sources say that Vice Admiral Niimi, commander of the Japanese fleet in Vietnamese territorial waters, after completing the transport of the vanguard to various bases in Vietnam, led his team back to Saigon harbor and visited the commander of the French Vietnamese fleet this afternoon. According to the Nikkan Shimbun, the Japanese army officially entered Cam Ranh Bay on Thursday. Prior to this, Major General Sumida, leader of the Japanese military delegation, had discussed the entry procedures with the French commander of the naval base.

Hanoi, 2nd (Reuters) – Vietnamese newspapers suddenly stopped publishing anti-British articles yesterday. Officials say that Japanese troops are landing one after another according to the planned schedule, without any unexpected incidents. Yesterday, Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux received Dr. Biitt, a former counselor at the German embassy in Chongqing, who recently arrived here by land with three embassy staff members. Thailand is scheduled to complete the handover of the ceded territories of Cambodia and Laos today. There have been no reports of disturbances during the handover of the land.

### It is rumored that China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands have established an agreement: If necessary, they will jointly restrain Japan; Britain will declare war if the Dutch East Indies are attacked

Washington, 2nd (International News Service) – Well-informed sources here said yesterday that China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands have reached an agreement on actions to be taken in the event of a Japanese advance to the south. The details of the agreement are kept secret, but it is understood that according to the terms of the agreement, if the four countries are jointly involved in a war against Japan, they will unanimously impose economic sanctions on Japan and mutually use naval and military bases. President Roosevelt met with British Ambassador to the United States Halifax yesterday to discuss plans for Britain and the United States to intensify economic sanctions against Japan if Japan encroaches on Thailand. It is said that Britain is rushing to build airfields and fortifications on the Malay Peninsula day and night to prevent Singapore from being attacked by land from Thailand. Washington believes that if Japan attacks the Dutch East Indies, Britain will immediately declare war on it. It is also said that the United States has assured the Dutch East Indies that if they are attacked, the United States will immediately provide assistance. The nature and scope of assistance have not been announced because they are military secrets.

### Japan Announces Freeze on Funds in India and Other Places

Tokyo, 2nd (United Press) – Japan today froze funds in Japan belonging to India, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa in retaliation for the freezing of Japanese funds by those countries.

Tokyo, 2nd (Reuters) – The Ministry of Finance announced that restrictions on transactions between foreigners and Japanese will be implemented on August 4 for nationals of New Zealand and South Africa.

### Coastal Defense of Honolulu Taken Over by US Navy; Multiple Air Force Stations in the Philippines Activated; Second Batch of Filipino Soldiers Enlisted into US Army

Washington, 2nd (United Press) – The Navy yesterday took over the personnel, equipment, and all activities of the coastal defense of the Honolulu area (14th District) until the crisis is over.

Washington, 2nd (International News Service) – The U.S. Navy announced yesterday that the Cavite and Sangley Point naval air stations in the Philippines will begin operations on September 1. Others on Johnston Island and Palmyra Island are scheduled to be activated on August 5.

Manila, 2nd (United Press) – President Quezon today summoned ten infantry brigades with 15,000 men to be enlisted into the U.S. Army from September 1. This action was taken at the request of Lieutenant General MacArthur, commander of the U.S. Far East Command. This is the first batch of Filipino troops to be enlisted into the U.S. Army, the first batch being the Air Force from August 15.

### Britain Sends Air Force Reinforcements to Defend Burma

London, 2nd (United Press) – Authoritative sources here said yesterday that a large amount of air force reinforcements, including American-made Brewster Buffalo fighters, have arrived in Burma. The British Air Force there is preparing to defend this strategically important Far East base. General Brooke-Popham, commander of the British Far East Command, said that if the war spreads to Manila, Burma can launch aircraft to fight within a few hours due to the arrival of large numbers of reinforcements, and it already has the most suitable aircraft. Authoritative sources said that in the past few days, countless men and women from the Shan states have been clearing grass and trees and building airfields in the area along the coast and the Thai border. The various airfields from Lashio to Momeik in the northern part of Burma are also being built by them. It is said that most of the airfields being built have been completed and are well-equipped for heavy bombers to take off.

### Dutch East Indies Controls Trade with Japan, Including Oil

Batavia, 2nd (Reuters) – Japanese sources say that the Dutch East Indies is temporarily not issuing licenses for goods shipped to Japan. It is said that the licensing system announced last week has placed all trade with Japan under government control, including deliveries stipulated in oil agreements. Van Mook, the Dutch East Indies Minister for Economic Affairs, said that the issuance of export licenses is based on the situation in the Pacific. He made no predictions about the possible actions of the Dutch East Indies government in the near future.

### Japan Demands Exclusive Monopoly on Thai Trade

London, 2nd (United Press) – Reliable sources here said yesterday in an exchange of telegrams from Laos and Angorvent Province that Japan is demanding a formal monopoly on Thai trade, including rubber, tin, and the use of Thai naval, land, and air force bases. According to reports, Thailand previously obtained Laos and Angorvent from Vietnam through Japan's mediation.

London, 2nd (United Press) – It was believed here yesterday that the rumor that Japan was demanding additional Vietnamese territory in exchange for Thai naval and air bases was the result of overly lenient economic sanctions against Japan by civilized countries. On the other hand, Tokyo's rapid apology and promise of compensation for the bombing of the American warship, as well as the guarantee that similar incidents would not occur in the future, indicate that Japan is making every effort to avoid unnecessary provocations against the United States. A small group of experts here believe that Japan is now clearly attempting to expand its influence to Thailand, and Konoe will continue his southward advance despite the threat of embargoes, as he believes that embargoes are inevitable.

Editorial

### The United States Takes the Second Step in Sanctions

President Roosevelt issued an order yesterday banning the transport of aircraft gasoline and lubricating oil to places outside the Western Hemisphere, the British Empire, and all countries resisting aggression. The export of other oil products, except to the above-mentioned areas, must also be limited to the average amount before the war. Therefore, Japan will no longer be able to purchase gasoline from the United States, and even ordinary oil will only be able to return to pre-war quantities, and will no longer be able to be supplied without restriction as in the past few years. This measure is indeed a more thorough sanctioning measure after the freezing of assets. It can not only sweep away some doubts about the United States' Far East policy in the world for the past week, but also completely cleanse the United States' evil reputation of constantly supplying instruments of murder to aggressor countries.

Originally, after the United States and Britain announced the freezing of Japanese assets, there were various rumors about a compromise plan for negotiations between the United States and Japan and that the United States still had not forgotten its appeasement of Japan. The United States and Britain's watching the Japanese navy, army, and air force safely enter southern Vietnam without taking any action made people feel disappointed. Thus, the outside world was either saying that the United States and Japan were negotiating a "temporary solution," or blindly optimistic, believing that nothing would happen to the Far Eastern situation for the time being. In fact, even if we take a step back and admit that the United States has no intention of breaking with Japan for the time being, how could Roosevelt, who is wise, decisive, and far-sighted, not know that Japan is an opportunist? As long as the international situation is exploitable, anyone dares to assert that Japan will move, let alone Roosevelt? As far as Japan is concerned, even if it is admitted that the Tokyo government does not dare to excessively stimulate the emotions of the United States and Britain at this time, and is therefore doing its best to conceal its ambitions, hoping not to immediately cause a Far Eastern war, how can the arrogant, suspicious, and at the same time infatuated with the "Pan-Asian hegemony dream" Japanese military not know that Britain and the United States will eventually interfere with its southward advance, and therefore there will eventually be a day of armed force? Frankly speaking, even if the United States has some intention of appeasing Japan at this time, it is not sincerely trying to befriend Japan. At most, it is delaying the day so that it can actively complete the necessary military arrangements in the Far East and concentrate the necessary armaments in preparation for an effective strike in the future. Similarly, even if Japan has some psychological misgivings about the United States at this time, it is not sincerely trying to dispel suspicion and make peace with the United States. The real purpose is, of course, also to delay the day so that, on the one hand, as this newspaper reported the other day, it can digest the rights and interests it has already seized as much as possible, complete its so-called high defense and "co-prosperity sphere," and on the other hand, wait for the most favorable opportunity in the international situation to achieve its ambitions. On this basis, the United States and Japan have already launched a "time competition" in the South Pacific. Both sides are actively deploying in their own camps, but on the surface, they have not only not officially broken up, but even deliberately make some gestures to slacken the other side's vigilance. In other words, the conflict between the United States and Japan in the South Pacific has long been inevitable. The only question is when it will erupt. However, before the two sides officially break up, they must try their best to actively prepare diplomatically, politically, militarily, and economically. Therefore, Japan will inevitably further conquer Vietnam, and will inevitably continue to put pressure on Thailand in the future. At the same time, the United States will inevitably step up the completion of the joint defense line of China, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and the Soviet Union in the Far East. In the future, the key depends on which side is the first to prepare for completion, or which side the development of the international situation first gives the opportunity to act. Assuming that Japan's deployment in southern Vietnam is rapid and it immediately obtains Thailand's cooperation, or that a sudden change occurs in Germany's war against the Soviet Union in a short period of time, Japan will of course not let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for expansion. Conversely, if the German-Soviet war continues to be deadlocked and the military supplement for the Far East joint defense of China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, as well as the Chinese counter-offensive, is completed early, it is possible that the democratic camp will take the lead and resolve Japan ahead of schedule.

In short, the actions of the United States and Japan are currently in a race. President Roosevelt's resolute ban on gasoline transportation to Japan proves that the United States has the courage and preparation to compete for the initiative. Now, of course, we have to see how Japan counterattacks. Probably after several more rounds of such peaceful "hand-to-hand combat" between the two sides, unless Japan admits defeat, the final scene of this Far Eastern war is likely to be staged soon.

US and Soviet Union Discuss Far East Military Cooperation; Vladivostok May Be Available for US Use; Tokyo Expresses Anxiety

Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Haitong News Agency) – The Social Democratic newspaper published here reported from London that Hopkins does not intend to discuss measures on how the United States will assist the Soviet Union with the Soviet authorities, so this matter will be negotiated by the new Soviet representative arriving in the United States in the United States. Hopkins intends to negotiate to hope that Stalin will allow the United States to use certain air force and naval bases in the Soviet Union. It has been learned that the Soviet government may allow the United States to use Vladivostok.

Tokyo, 2nd (United Press) – The "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated today that Japan must pay close attention to the cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States in the Far East, because it may lead to the Soviet Union and the United States concluding a military agreement to surround Japan. The newspaper said that the United States' approval of transporting large amounts of oil to the Soviet Union, that is, deciding to transport it through the Pacific Ocean, shows that the United States no longer cares about Japan's feelings for the Three-Power Alliance. The newspaper also said that the United States' transportation of oil to the Soviet Union is in exchange for obtaining a base in Kamchatka, so as to connect with Alaska, so as to transport troops through the Aleutian Islands.

### Roosevelt Praises the Achievements of the Red Army; US Military Supplies Supplied to the Soviet Union Not Supported by Lend-Lease

### Japan Actively Engaged in Military Preparations; Japanese Army in Manchuria Greatly Increased; Domestic Labor Greatly Lacking; Students Mobilized to Serve in Military Service

Tokyo, 2nd (United Press) – Today's observers stated that Japan, on the one hand, has begun to tighten its economy, and at the same time, Japan has engaged in extensive military preparations to cope with any emergency. The nature of this military preparation has not been released, but all the troops that Japan currently has can be said to be the largest in Japan's history. The mobilization of troops has caused a shortage of labor, so the Ministry of Education has announced that junior high school and senior grade students must immediately form national service teams and receive military training at the same time.

London, 2nd (Reuters) – Well-informed sources here claim that there are signs that a large number of Japanese troops are being transferred from Japan to Manchuria. It is reported that part of this transfer is taking place via Korea, and another part is crossing the Sea of Japan. It is said that the troop transfer took place in the middle of last week. London does not know the exact number, but it seems clear that the Japanese army in Manchuria has greatly increased.

Changchun, 2nd (Reuters) – At present, foreigners traveling from Manchuria to Korea and the Kwantung Leased Territory must obtain new passports that are valid for one-way travel only. Japan and Manchuria have implemented control over telegrams and telephones. Telegrams are only allowed in international code, and telephones are only allowed in Chinese and Japanese dialects.

### Foreign Minister Guo Receives Reporters, Discusses International Situation, Opposes Appeasement of Japan - Japan's Southern Advance Policy Has Been Determined, Britain and the United States Must Intensify Economic Sanctions

Chongqing - Foreign Minister Dr. Guo Taiqi stated this morning while receiving reporters that global attention is now focused on Thailand, because Japan has not only advanced into Thailand but has also entered Thai territory. Recent indications are that Thailand's recognition of Manchukuo was the result of Japanese coercion. We have always held a hope that Thailand would resist Japanese aggression, as the fate of its neighbor Vietnam should serve as a warning to Thailand. However, Thailand has now accepted Japanese control, which is deeply regrettable. Thailand's actions not only concern China but also other countries in the Pacific, which have expressed their dissatisfaction with Japan's aggression in Vietnam through economic sanctions. When asked whether China will take retaliatory action against Thailand, Guo replied that the Chinese government has not yet received official confirmation of Thailand's recognition of Manchukuo. Although it is known that if Thailand takes this action, it will be entirely due to Japanese coercion, the Chinese government is currently considering this issue. Foreign Minister Guo expressed his satisfaction with the economic sanctions imposed by Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and India on Japan, stating that the parallel and coordinated measures of Britain and the United States are in line with China's repeated desire for closer cooperation to sanction aggressor nations. This move is not only a major blow to Japan but also clarifies the international situation. In the first two years of the War of Resistance, China was in a special position, receiving some assistance from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but fighting alone and unaided. Not only that, but other countries also had a tendency to avoid provoking Japan and to appease it. The current economic sanctions are the first direct action taken by other countries against Japan. When asked about President Roosevelt's special envoy, Hopkins, coming to Chongqing, Foreign Minister Guo replied that he has not yet received official news. If Hopkins does come, China will certainly welcome him warmly. Foreign Minister Guo also stated that all German and Italian diplomatic and consular personnel and expatriates have left the country. However, clergymen of German and Italian nationality may continue to reside in China if their activities do not go beyond the scope of church affairs and they abide by Chinese law. Foreign Minister Guo also vehemently opposed adopting a policy of appeasement toward Japan. If the economic measures recently adopted by Britain and the United States are to achieve their intended purpose, they must be strengthened. The economic noose around Japan's neck must be tightened sooner or later, and the sooner the better. As for the fear that a complete embargo might trigger an immediate Japanese attack on the Dutch East Indies and Singapore, this is unfounded. If Japan had the strength to advance south, it would certainly do so, regardless of whether there is an embargo or not. It must be understood that time is on Japan's side. Any attempt to prolong the situation will only benefit the Japanese, as their future actions may be determined by the progress of the Soviet-German war and developments in the Near East. Japan's policy has already been decided. The only question is the timing of its next move. As for whether Japan will attack north or advance south, there is little difference. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)

Chongqing - Foreign Minister Guo of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs discussed the current international situation at a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists on the morning of the 2nd. Guo first stated that regarding the Thailand issue, all parties are paying close attention. According to the current situation, Japan's aggressive blade is not only pointing at Thailand but has also penetrated the heart of Thailand. Therefore, Thailand is clearly under Japanese control. Thailand's recognition of Manchukuo is also clear evidence of Japanese violent oppression. Guo continued, stating that the fate of European small countries struggling to maintain neutrality or throwing themselves into the arms of the Axis powers under the war can serve as a strong warning to Thailand. In particular, Vietnam's result of surrender is even more of a lesson for Thailand. This situation not only raises major concerns in China but also has a great impact on all countries related to the Pacific. Guo then mentioned the economic sanctions taken by Britain, the United States, and India after Japan's southern advance, stating that these measures have proved the parallel actions of Britain in the Pacific. This development is highly consistent with China's overall policy. China has consistently adhered to the policy that anti-aggressors should unite and defend themselves. Therefore, from China's standpoint, the economic sanctions taken by Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and India are gratifying. This not only forms a major striking force against Japan but also allows the international situation to be thoroughly clarified. You all know that China is the vanguard of anti-aggression. Although China has obtained moral sympathy and material assistance from general democratic countries in the past four years of warfare, strictly speaking, China has always fought on its own. Recently, when the Vietnam issue occurred and various democratic countries in the South Pacific were threatened by strict military power, there was still a tendency to appease Japan until the announcement of the policy of freezing funds was implemented and the United States began to take active measures, which was a further step in the US anti-aggression policy and also the first time that the United States used the same policy to deal with China's enemy Japan as it did with Britain's enemy. Therefore, the anti-aggression front became increasingly clear and consolidated. Regarding the question of Japan's future moves (southward or northward), Guo stated in a very firm tone that "I believe, and Japanese public opinion also recognizes, that Japan's southern advance issue is inseparable from the so-called 'China Incident'. What I want to particularly draw attention to today is not the issue of Japan's movements but the issue of Japan's intensified cooperation with the Axis powers. This is a major decision from Japan's previous meeting. For example, after the reorganization of the Konoe cabinet, the resignation of Foreign Minister Matsuoka was probably also the result of the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. In short, Japan's basic policy has been determined. When it will launch depends on the evolution of the international situation." When Foreign Minister Guo reached this point, a reporter asked what countermeasures the Chinese government would take regarding Thailand's recognition of Manchukuo. Guo replied that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet received an official report. If it is true, the government will consider response measures. Also, regarding the issue of economic sanctions against Japan, Foreign Minister Guo replied to a foreign reporter that the economic sanctions taken by Britain and the United States have already been implemented. This method is like a (noose around the neck). I am very gratified that Britain and the United States are implementing this policy, but it seems that there is still room for improvement in the implementation of this policy. Frankly speaking, I cannot agree with this, because Japan's policy has always been conspiratorial and has never changed its purpose, not only to invade China but also to launch fierce attacks on other countries in the Pacific. I dare to believe that this conspiracy will soon be put into action. Guo continued, stating that Japan's economic destiny is completely in the hands of democratic countries. This is almost undoubtedly a fact. Therefore, Japan's economy will inevitably be brought to death one day, but I personally believe that Japan is the weakest link in the Axis powers. At this opportunity, the economic noose that Britain and the United States have placed on Japan's neck should be tightened. I believe that this action will be more effective the faster it is. Subsequently, a foreign reporter asked whether the United States' total embargo would cause Japan to attack Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. Foreign Minister Guo replied, "I can frankly tell you that if Japan's strength is fully prepared, any compromise policy cannot stop its southern advance. Therefore, in order to avoid Japan gaining sufficient time, democratic countries should preemptively strike; otherwise, the longer the disaster is delayed, the deeper it will become." Guo continued, stating that our envoys in Germany and Italy, as well as students and expatriates, have mostly set out to return home one after another. There is still a small part remaining in Germany and Italy, preparing to withdraw. As for the missionaries from Germany and Italy in China, they have not withdrawn. If their activities are within the legitimate scope of missionary work, they should be protected. Yesterday, Bishop Yu Bin also visited me on behalf of Archbishop Cai Ning, the Papal Representative to China, and expressed gratitude for the Chinese government's attitude. A foreign reporter asked again whether Foreign Minister Guo was prepared to welcome Hopkins to Chongqing. Guo smiled and said, "If Mr. Hopkins comes to China, I will of course welcome him wholeheartedly, but I have not yet received news of Mr. Hopkins coming to China." Finally, Foreign Minister Guo stated that the weekly press conference will still be attended by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Ministry, and I will personally attend every few weeks.

### Eastern Front Battles for Six Weeks - Red Army Holds Dominant Position - German Infantry Division Annihilated in Central Region - Nazi Army Reorganizes for Another Effort

United Press, London, 2nd - Today, well-informed military observers here, at the end of the sixth week of the Soviet-German war, all said that the fighting on the Eastern Front has become the initiative of the Soviet army, and the German army is passive. According to reliable news and official communiqués from Germany and the Soviet Union, experts believe that the fact that there has been no change in the front line in the past few days is enough to show that these two major combat armies have entered a decisive war, and the Soviet army has gradually gained an advantage. The experts estimate that the Soviet army's mobilization has now been practically completed. The manpower and materials of these two major opposing armies have formed a match, but the Soviet army's supply lines and transportation are better than the German army, and the manpower reserved for unused is also more than the German army. Therefore, these experts believe that the position now held by the Soviet army is more advantageous. Although the German Air Force has inflicted heavy losses on the rear of the Red Army, it is still easier for the Soviet army to mobilize huge amounts of personnel, use huge amounts of ammunition and gasoline than the German army. In view of the systematic burning of transportation money and military supplies by the Soviet army during its retreat, and the continued use of encirclement strategies to harass the rear of the German army, these experts believe that German reinforcements and military supplies must have become a strict military problem at this time.

Reuters, London, 2nd - Today's Soviet communiqué is slightly different from those released in the previous few days, stating that the Soviet army has defeated the German 137th Infantry Division in the Smolensk region. Last night, there were continued fierce battles in the Smolensk, Novo-Zhichev, Nevel, and Zhytomyr regions, but there were no large-scale wars in other places. Soviet aircraft continued to attack German troops on all routes.

Reuters, Moscow, 2nd - The Soviet Information Bureau issued a recent communiqué stating that yesterday there was fighting all day in the Pokov, Nevel, Smolensk, and Zhytomyr regions, but there were no major changes on the front lines. The Soviet Air Force continued to strike enemy motorized infantry and enemy aircraft at airfields, and sank one enemy patrol boat and one oil tanker of 5,000 tons in the Baltic Sea, and severely damaged four other enemy ships. On July 31, fifteen German aircraft were shot down in air battles, and the Soviet army lost seven aircraft. A Soviet team commanded by Tai Qingke completely defeated a German regiment, leaving 500 German corpses, capturing many enemy troops, and seizing six tanks, two armored vehicles, nine artillery pieces, eight machine guns, eight trucks loaded with shells, eighteen automobiles, fifty motorcycles, and other war trophies.

United Press, New York, 2nd - Yesterday's combined report from the front lines stated that Germany has been contained after six weeks of great war. It is currently heard that the German army is reorganizing, attempting a third decisive major assault against Soviet resistance. Soviet sources also did not mention Nazi great victories on the Eastern Front. Sources in London said that there has been no change on the front line in the past 24 hours, but warned not to assume that the front line has become stable. A Soviet spokesman in Moscow also issued the same warning.

### Germany Claims Victory, 30,000 Soviet Troops Captured

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 2nd - Berlin military officials declared yesterday afternoon that after the most intense annihilation war by the German army south of Smolensk against the surrounded Soviet army, 35,000 Soviet troops have been captured, and the battlefields are full of enemy corpses. The Soviet army also lost 250 large and small artillery pieces. The German army has recently intensified its pressure on the surrounded Soviet army. The Soviet army's several attempts to break out failed, resulting in heavy casualties. German artillery and aircraft continued to bombard fiercely, and the shells rained down, causing the Soviet army to be immersed in a sea of fire. The German army finally solved it with assault teams followed by infantry to attack the Soviet army. The surrounded Soviet army northeast of Smolensk also attempted to break out on July 31 but failed.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 2nd - The "People's Observer" today reviewed the German army's war on the Eastern Front, stating that the German war against the Soviet Union has lasted for six weeks so far, and the German army has penetrated 800 kilometers into Soviet territory. The German army is continuing to advance rapidly on the Eastern Front.

Havana News Agency, a Certain Place on the German Border, 1st - The great battle in the Smolensk region in the central route has lasted for several days. As a result of the Red Army's fierce counterattack, the German army has had to fight both inside and outside the encirclement line at the same time. Both sides have suffered heavy losses, and it is still difficult to determine who will win, but it can be said that the battle has reached a decisive juncture. The situation on the southern route is also the same. Although the German-Romanian joint forces claim to have crossed the lower reaches of the Dniester River, the actual strength of the Red Army there is still unknown, and a major battle is bound to unfold. On the northern route, the Red Army authorities claim to be counterattacking in the Pokhov and Novo-Riev regions, attempting to threaten the German army's flanks at Lake Ilmen, but the key to the northern battlefield, the siege of Leningrad, has not yet been lifted. Eight divisions of the Red Army in the region are trapped in an encirclement. According to German claims, since the start of the war, the German army has occupied an average of 10,000 square miles per day, and the occupied area is now larger than Germany's mainland.

### Soviet Cavalry Guerrilla Warfare Harasses Axis Rear

United Press, London, 2nd - Yesterday, Moscow Radio stated that a team of Soviet cavalry has entered the rear of the German-Romanian joint forces, destroying two newly built bridges.

The guerrillas are said to have observed for many days before the attack.

### Argentine Congressmen Advocate Severing Ties with Germany; Axis Activities Spreading, Equating to Hostile Acts; Mexican Government Sternly Rejects German Proposals

Reuter's dispatch from the Argentine capital, dated the 2nd.

Following the publication of its investigation report by the Argentine Congressional Committee investigating Axis activities, Argentine congressmen may advocate severing diplomatic relations with Germany. The committee chairman, Taibo Da, told reporters yesterday that he knew that some congressmen would propose severing ties with Germany, as it has now been confirmed that Axis activities exist and are spreading widely. This is greatly detrimental to the integrity of the nation and its institutions. All those participating in these activities despise everything Argentine, and their activities can be regarded as hostile acts. It is reported that the Argentine government has asked the German ambassador to explain why a wireless radio was found in the luggage of a member of the embassy staff last week, as wireless radios are not permissible items in the luggage of diplomats.

Reuter's dispatch from Washington, dated the 2nd. Germany, believing that the United States' inclusion of certain merchants in Latin America on the "Black List" hinders the neutrality of Latin American countries, asked Mexico to protest to the United States. Mexico has now sternly rejected this request. U.S. Acting Secretary of State Welles commented on the matter yesterday, denouncing Germany's brazenness, saying that Germany has already undermined the sovereignty of many countries, and now it is advising Mexico or other countries to safeguard their sovereignty, which is truly shameless. In fact, Mexico needs no advice from Germany.

A dispatch from the Turkish capital also stated that travelers from Greece say that at least ten people starve to death in Athens every day, and fights break out frequently in the streets due to hunger. A United Press dispatch from the Hungarian capital stated that three members of the National Peasant Party in the Romanian Parliament have been sent to concentration camps. The National Broadcasting Company monitored a Moscow radio report stating that Schulenburg, the German ambassador to Moscow before the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, is under house arrest by special police in Angara.

### Many Foreigners Unable to Return to Shanghai Due to Obstruction in Various Parts of North China

Japanese Side Adopts New Measures to Obstruct; Group of Yantai Students Unable to Come Here

Regarding the return of foreigners from various ports in North China to Shanghai, new difficulties have arisen. Japanese officials here remain silent, saying only that they have no knowledge of the matter. However, according to inquiries made this morning (the 2nd), a large number of foreigners in Yantai, Qingdao, and Dalian are being obstructed by measures taken by the Japanese authorities and are unable to obtain the convenience of returning to Shanghai.

### Qingdao and Dalian Not Approving Visas

It is reported that the Japanese consulates have completely stopped approving visas for foreigners wishing to go to Qingdao, Yantai, and Dalian, except in a few special circumstances. Yesterday, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai did not explain the reason for this new development. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai said that he had not yet received any news about the matter but expected to hear something soon.

### This Move May Be a Temporary Measure

A foreign official told reporters that he believed that the restrictions currently imposed by the Japanese side on foreigners traveling to or leaving ports in North China are only temporary measures. The strong attitude adopted by the Japanese authorities in North China may be due to the unstable situation since the British and Americans froze Sino-Japanese funds. At the same time, mail to and from North China is also being detained by the Japanese authorities. The British authorities have already made representations to the Japanese side regarding this matter.

### Restrictions on Foreigners Traveling to Japan Still in Place

According to news this morning, the restrictions previously imposed by the Japanese side on approving visas for foreigners traveling to Japan have not yet been lifted. An official at the Japanese Embassy said that he was unaware of any changes regarding the approval of visas for foreigners traveling to Japan. The reason why foreigners leaving Shanghai on the Japanese ship Nitta Maru were able to obtain visas was that the ship was originally scheduled to sail to the United States. In addition, the restrictions that began about two weeks ago have not changed.

### Yantai Students Prevented from Coming to Shanghai

The North China Daily News reports that, according to a telegram received in Shanghai yesterday (the 1st), the Japanese side is currently not allowing any foreigners to leave Yantai, for reasons unknown, and mail is also being detained. It is reported that the British Consulate in that port has received appeals from British expatriates and is making representations to the Japanese authorities. If the Japanese side does not relax this prohibition before August 6, then a group of students from the Yantai school run by the China Inland Mission, who are scheduled to depart for Shanghai on that day, may have to postpone their trip. In addition, other foreigners who plan to leave Yantai for Tianjin will also be unable to travel. It is reported that some of the students scheduled to come to Shanghai from Yantai on August 6 have already purchased tickets for the American President liner scheduled to sail from Shanghai in mid-August. If the Japanese side continues to disallow foreigners from leaving Yantai, then the parents of these students in Shanghai will face major inconvenience. According to what can be confirmed as of yesterday, the Japanese side's prohibition on foreigners leaving Yantai has no excuse such as quarantine, and Shanghai has never received any news of infectious diseases in Yantai.

### More Cases of True Cholera Discovered in This City

Citizens Should Be Careful with Their Diet and Daily Life

More cases of true cholera have recently been discovered in this city. According to the Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital, in the past week, the hospital has examined patients confirmed to have true cholera, including: Sun Zhu Shi, residing at No. 31 Junji Lane, Xinjiang Road, from Jiangbei; Sun Da Mao, residing with Sun Zhu Shi, from Jiangbei; Ji Cai Feng, residing at No. 576 Dexing Lane, Haining Road, from Ningbo; A Er, residing at No. 21 Songtong Lane, junction of Qipu Road and Shanxi Road, from Jiangbei; and Li A Si, residing at No. 54 Dexing Lane, North Jiangxi Road, from Jiangbei. Among them, three people have already recovered, and the remaining two are still receiving saline injections for treatment. At a time when epidemics are prevalent, citizens must be extra careful about their daily life and diet.

### Three Religions Morality Society Continues to Help Impoverished Families

Since the Shanghai Three Religions Morality Benevolent Society has been providing relief to impoverished families, it has registered and provided food to 140 impoverished families, totaling 595 people. Recently, the Society received another hundred bags of cracked wheat from the American Red Cross and continued to distribute them. Those already registered as impoverished families will be notified by the Society by postcard. Those who wish to request assistance can obtain an application form from the Society's office at No. 10 Hongyun Villa, Lane 70, Jing'an Temple Road.

### Russian Youth Party Vows Allegiance to the Motherland

Speech, Beliefs, Confidence, and Thought All Belong to the Homeland; Renounce Political Disputes and Strive to Sacrifice Oneself to Repay the Country

The North China Daily News reports that the leader of the Russian Youth Party (a White Russian émigré group), Stepanov, recently issued a declaration calling on Russians to abandon all political disputes and assist the motherland as much as possible in fighting against Germany. Although the party has always opposed the Soviet government, now that the Soviet government is defending its homeland for the long term, the party is abandoning its previous opposition policy. The declaration stated, in brief, that the Russian Youth Party had long expected that Germany would attack Russia. Although it cannot actively participate in defending Russia, its speech, beliefs, confidence, and thought all belong to the homeland. The Russian Youth Party has always placed the interests of Russia and the families of its people first. At this time when Russian blood flows from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea to resist every difficult season of German invasion, the young party members, born as children of Russia, reiterate that every Russian must stand on the side of the motherland. There can be no political disputes, but one should sacrifice oneself to repay the country.

### Russian Broadcast of Soviet War News Banned by French Concession

Considered to Contain Political Criticism; However, Russians Repeatedly Request Continued Broadcasting

The North China Daily News reports that Troitsky, assistant editor of a Russian-language newspaper in this city, has been broadcasting war news from TASS and other sources in Russian every evening from 7:00 PM on the Great American Radio Station (call sign XMHC) at No. 17 Edward Road, which has been well-received by Russian radio listeners. However, it was suddenly announced yesterday (the 1st) that it would be stopped.

### Only Reporting News and Not Propagating

According to Troitsky, he received notification from the radio station that his broadcast report was banned by the French Concession Police, so he no longer broadcasts on the Great American Radio Station. However, he was quite surprised by this action of the French Concession Police, as his daily broadcast of news was not propaganda but simply reading news mostly from Moscow.

### Listeners Request Continued Broadcasting

Several Russian-language radio stations in the Public Concession have written to Troitsky, asking him to continue broadcasting to Russians on their stations. According to Shanghai Russians yesterday, Russian radio listeners welcome Troitsky's news broadcast because it can counter the Nazi propaganda messages broadcast in Russian by the German radio station here. Troitsky admitted that he had received more than one hundred phone calls from sympathizers, asking him to continue broadcasting news about the Soviet Union.

### Authorities Consider It a Violation of Orders

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury also reported that Troitsky's broadcasting program was cancelled due to his violation of the conditions agreed upon with the Great American Radio Station. It is said that Troitsky had agreed with the radio station only to broadcast news in Russian, but he made critical remarks during the broadcast. The French Municipal Council had ordered the Great American Radio Station to prohibit political propaganda. Troitsky's political criticism violated the Council's orders, so the Russian-language program was terminated from last night.

### British Tram Company and Labor Representatives Agree on Reciprocal Principles

The workers in the machine and vehicle departments of the British Shanghai Tramways Company in this city, due to the current high prices and difficulty in maintaining their livelihoods, requested that the company authorities increase subsidies to compensate for this. Now, the union has agreed with the company's manager and the company authorities on three reciprocal principles between labor and management, and both parties have signed them. The reciprocal principles are as follows: (1) Increase the special living allowance for each mechanic, driver, and ticket seller by 60 cents per day. (2) Workers who are sick and hospitalized in Renji Hospital will continue to receive their basic salary, excluding subsidies for supplies and rice, but for a maximum of two weeks per person per year, and the company will pay the hospital expenses. In special circumstances where the time limit needs to be extended, the company may handle it at its discretion. (3) The "Peaceful Award" for drivers will be increased from 10 cents to 15 cents per day, and the monthly award for good conduct will be increased from two yuan to three yuan.

### Domestic Finance Remains Stable; Industry and Commerce Flourishing

Annual Report of Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank

The Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank's operating report for the 29th year of the Republic regarding the domestic economic situation generally stated: Due to years of unrest, losses have been not inconsiderable, and production and consumption cannot be improved temporarily during this wartime period. Generally speaking, the economic situation in various regions is still considered stable. The report is divided into finance, trade, prices, and industry and commerce, and excerpts are as follows:

### Domestic Finance Still Considered Stable

Domestic finance, except for slight fluctuations in May, is still considered stable. Among financial institutions, the Nanjing Yeshang Bank's Shanghai branch temporarily suspended business; it soon resumed business, and other banks, such as Sichuan, Mei Chuan Salt, Gecheng, and Chongqing Banks, have successively increased their capital. To stabilize finance, the government promulgated measures to manage banks. As for the price of government bonds, both Shanghai and Wuhan rose sharply, almost on par with before the war. The newly issued government bonds were for military and construction needs, and the Four Banks Loan Committee loans reached 124 million yuan. The interest rates for loans throughout the year in Shanghai did not fluctuate significantly. The exchange rate for remittances, although it once reached a premium of 150 yuan, gradually decreased and is now equal to the original rate. The establishment of a new remittance system by silver and money exchanges has been quite convenient and well-received. However, the popularity of European Common Market notes among foreign merchants proves the prevalence of social speculation. Because of the abundance of floating capital in the market, Shanghai banks have seen a surge in deposits, mostly in the form of current accounts. At this time, banks have narrower avenues for lending, so they have all reduced interest rates to reduce costs.

### Important Measures for Financial Undertakings

In addition to implementing measures to manage banks, the government's important measures for finance include: (1) Attention to rural loans: The Four Banks and other financial institutions have long-term loans in rural areas in the interior, totaling 20.9 million yuan, which can be said to be effective in adjusting the rural economy. (2) The efforts of the Exchange Stabilization Fund: After the establishment of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, it has made considerable efforts. With the cooperation of friendly countries, the exchange market has been stabilized. However, China has had a large trade deficit in recent years, making it difficult to balance international payments. Fortunately, the Exchange Stabilization Fund constantly assesses market conditions and determines buying and selling, otherwise the changes in the exchange market would have been even greater. (3) Issuance of new subsidiary coins: After the amendment of the Subsidiary Coin Regulations, the Central Mint immediately started minting these coins. However, the circulation area is limited to Free China, and subdivision banknotes and hard coins are issued in one corner to meet the needs. (4) Promotion of savings deposits: After the promulgation of the Savings Deposit Regulations, various banks have actively promoted savings deposits. Currently, they have reached over 300 million yuan and are opening simplified savings accounts to absorb social floating capital for national construction.

Flourishing Trade Saves the Trade Deficit

According to customs figures, the total value of national foreign trade was 3,997,263,000 yuan. Among them, the value of imports was 2,027,143,000 yuan, an increase of 693,489,000 yuan compared to the 28th year. The value of exports was 1,970,120,000 yuan, an increase of 942,874,000 yuan compared to the 28th year. The trade deficit was 57,022,000 yuan, a decrease of 149,385,000 yuan compared to the 28th year. However, the import figures are converted to national currency in gold units, and customs still converts them according to the government's legal exchange rate, while the export figures are calculated according to the black market exchange rate, so they cannot accurately reflect the trade situation. If the import figures are also calculated using the black market exchange rate, then imports should be 5,474,311,000 yuan, and the trade deficit should be 3,504,190,000 yuan, an increase of 1,309,414,000 yuan compared to the 28th year, so the prosperity of trade can be seen here. Shanghai accounts for the largest share of this huge import trade, accounting for 37.09 percent, followed by Tianjin, and then Qingdao.

Industry and Commerce Flourishing

The prosperity of industry and commerce in various regions is as in previous years. The imbalance between production and consumption has led to the abnormal development of industry and commerce. As far as Shanghai is concerned, except for those who went bankrupt and liquidated in May due to speculation failures, the rest have made countless profits. There are no accurate statistics on new industrial and commercial firms, so it is not convenient to make presumptions; what can be said is that the number of new companies far exceeds the number of bankruptcies, but they are all limited in capital and not large in scale. The industry and commerce in the interior are also extremely developed, due to the westward migration of the population, the increase in consumption, and the inconvenience of transportation, which prompted the planning of local manufacturing. All these are factors in the development of industry and commerce. The government is working hard to develop sources of profit, and the industry and commerce of Free China are just beginning to flourish.

Adjust Prices to Stabilize People's Livelihood

The sharp rise in prices in various regions this year is unprecedented. According to statistics, the price index at the end of last December was 37.2, and at the end of this December, it jumped to 611.4. From January to May, it gradually increased, from June to August, it slightly decreased, and after September, it rose in a straight line, an increase of 384.9 percent compared to one month before the war. Among the building materials category, cement rose the most, because the price of this commodity rose very little in the 28th year. The next largest increases were for white lead, silk, raw yellow leather, etc. The price of grain continued to rise sharply, and the issue of people's food became very serious, with the price of grain causing the rise of other prices. As for Chongqing, the price was lower than Shanghai from January to May, but after June, when Shanghai fell back slightly, Chongqing continued to rise steadily. The increase in the cost of living in the interior has increased endlessly, and the authorities have made every effort to adjust it to stabilize the people's livelihood.

### Workers at Hongkou Japanese-Owned East Asia Tobacco Factories Strike

Factory Refuses Demands, Creating a Stalemate; Windstorm at British-Owned United Shipyard Resolved Satisfactorily

Recently, due to the soaring prices in this city, which have greatly affected the lives of workers, there have been frequent storms demanding improved treatment. A few days ago, the British-owned United Shipyard and the Japanese-owned East Asia No. 1 and No. 2 Tobacco Factories in the Hongkou district successively experienced strikes. The storm at the British-owned United Shipyard has been satisfactorily resolved, but the storm at the Japanese-owned factory may escalate because the factory has refused the demands. The reporter has investigated and recorded the details as follows:

Windstorm at United Shipyard Resolved

The British-owned United Shipyard (including Ruixing, Gefeng, Xiang Sheng shipyards and Dongjiadu dock) in Yangshupu, Hongkou, employs more than 3,250 workers. The factory has been doing well recently. Four Soviet merchant ships were brought into the dock for repairs last month. Workers worked day and night, streaming back and forth. Due to the high prices and difficult living conditions, all workers made two demands to the factory on the 25th of last month: (1) Increase wages by 30% to 50%. (2) Increase night work subsidy to one yuan per night. The factory manager, Bonner, accepted the principles and promised to reply after submitting them to the board of directors for discussion. The reply was not given until the end of last month (i.e., July 30). The workers had no choice but to strike on the morning of the 1st. The foreman of the factory, Li Fusheng, and the foremen Yan Guoguang, Sun Jinyang, and Qian Rendao persuaded the workers to return to work and made requests to the factory, and negotiations were held on that day. Through sincere efforts to resolve the situation, the following was agreed: (1) A general wage increase of 20%. (2) The night work subsidy was deemed satisfactory. The dispute was resolved completely.

Joint Strike at Japanese-Owned Tobacco Factory

The East Asia No. 1 Factory (formerly the Chinese-owned Huadong Tobacco Factory) on Tangkou Road, Baoding Road and the East Asia No. 2 Factory (formerly the Chinese-owned Huaping Tobacco Factory) at the intersection of Peikai Er Road and Liaoyang Road have a total of more than 2,600 male and female workers. Recently, due to the slow business of the factory, work has been reduced, and the wages earned by the workers are less than ten yuan per month, making it impossible to maintain a living. Moreover, the treatment of the two factories is usually more harsh than that of other factories. Work has been reduced, and meal subsidies have also been deducted, making the lives of the workers even more unbearable. The workers had no choice but to jointly strike on the 30th of last month and make four demands: (1) A general wage increase of 100%. (2) A rice subsidy of six dou per month. (3) Work deductions should not deduct meal expenses. (4) Workers should be paid during sick leave. Representatives were sent to the factory, but the factory completely refused without any consideration. The two sides have reached extremes. The workers insist that their goals must be achieved. The management has notified the police and dispatched Chinese and Japanese detectives to arrest the workers' representatives as a threat. Both sides have a very firm attitude. If the stalemate continues, it may lead to a serious situation.

### Prices Rising Again; Authorities Strictly Prohibiting

Simply Investigating Prices Is of Little Help

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that a spokesman for the Municipal Council stated yesterday (the 1st) that recent political developments have given the profiteers in this city an opportunity to raise prices. The prices of almost all daily necessities rose yesterday. The prices of some imported goods have already been raised, but the prices of domestic products have not changed much. Merchants said that the stock of imported goods will not be replenished, so prices are rising. It is expected that it will be difficult to obtain imported goods in the future, and the prices of imported luxury goods have already risen significantly last week. Regarding rice, the public should purchase the foreign rice purchased by the Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council to save money. The former sells for 116 yuan per dan, and the latter sells for 89 yuan. The responsible party said that the only way to control the profiteers is to strictly control prices. Simply investigating prices is of little help. It is reported that the department stores in this city have agreed to raise prices uniformly at a specified time, using the difficulty of procuring goods as an excuse.

### Scholarship Applicant Investigation Begins Yesterday

Bank Employees Respond with Group Donations, Movie Star Li Qinian Also Promotes Donations

Our newspaper's reader scholarship applications have been pouring in these past few days. Our newspaper staff has been extremely busy handling the procedures for allocation, review, and approval. Since schools at all levels are about to begin, in order to prioritize the studies of the applicants, we began investigations yesterday. Our newspaper dispatched many personnel to visit the actual living conditions of each family. Although it was unbearably hot yesterday, everyone happily set out. We hope that applicants will cooperate and provide convenience when our newspaper sends personnel to visit. For applicants with special circumstances, our newspaper will send separate letters to notify them to come to the office for an interview. Please be punctual upon receiving the letter and do not break the appointment.

Donations Yesterday

Yesterday's donors include a group of bank employees with 1,000 yuan, Ms. Li Qinian with 300 yuan, workers at Hongen Hospital with a combined donation of 94 yuan, Mr. Zhou Baotai with 50 yuan collected by Tong Lianbin, Mr. Zhang Xiufu with 2 yuan, totaling 1,446 yuan. Previously stored 16,966 yuan, 6 jiao, 1 fen, for a grand total of 18,412 yuan, 6 jiao, 1 fen.

Group Scholarship

Yesterday, the fundraising achieved outstanding results. Employees of a major bank responded with a group donation, allocating 1,000 yuan, setting an example for the banking industry. The bank employees hold the belief that "doing good is the greatest joy" and prefer not to reveal their bank's name or their individual names, which can be considered the ultimate act of kindness. Movie star Ms. Li Qinian recently received a remuneration of 400 yuan for advertising a certain product and added 100 yuan herself. In addition to donating 200 yuan to a destitute children's orphanage, she donated 300 yuan yesterday to support scholarships. Her warm heart and traditional values are admirable. Seventy-three workers from Hongen Hospital also made group donations through their union. Everyone's money is earned through hard work and is not easily obtained, so their generous donations and chivalrous spirit are commendable.

### The Iron Gates of the French Concession and Nanshi Continue to Be Closed

They Were Opened for Five Minutes Yesterday

Since the French authorities implemented temporary security measures on the 1st to maintain order within the Concession, in addition to erecting barbed wire fences along Avenue Foch and Avenue Edward, and securing non-essential roads, the iron gates that normally opened between the French Concession and Nanshi were also closed. Until 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the French authorities ordered the closed iron gates to be reopened, and a large number of people entered and exited Nanshi for a short period. It was then heard that the Japanese demanded that they be resealed. The French authorities then ordered them to be closed again. Therefore, the opening yesterday morning only lasted for five minutes. However, a large number of ordinary people were blocked inside and outside the iron gates and stood waiting for the gates to open. Until the evening, the iron gates remained tightly shut and did not reopen. Whether they will be open today is still a question.

The closure of the iron gates at the border between the French Concession and Chinese Nanshi has been going on for three days now. The situation inside the city is gradually easing. It is reported that in the northern part of the city, on streets such as Route de la République (Huafaguo Minguo Lu), postmen and government vehicles are allowed to pass, while north of Fangbang Road, Japanese military police are still stationed with guns and live ammunition, making the situation more tense. The Japanese troops along Libang Road have now retreated and been replaced by . Ordinary residents are still not allowed to take a single step outside. South of Fangbang Road, in the Jia Road area, people can move freely. The Japanese military police have posted a notice stating that all public officials with identification documents, as well as women, children, and the elderly (children limited to under 14 years of age), are allowed to pass. However, the route that women and children can take must follow the Zhao Kai River and then reach the Concession. In the refugee area, Japanese military police are searching house by house, but due to insufficient manpower, the work is very delayed. There is still no confirmed date for when all the iron gates will officially open.

### Notice to Passengers Going to Shantou

The Taikoo Shipping Company in this port received a telegram from Shantou stating, "Passengers traveling to Shantou must have a certificate of epidemic prevention and a certificate of typhoid fecal examination before being allowed to disembark." Therefore, the company is notifying passengers traveling to Shantou that they must complete the above procedures in advance before boarding the ship to avoid being hindered when disembarking.

### Customs Decides on Fifteen Categories of Goods Prohibited for Export

However, Some Items Included Have Not Been Decided Yet

After the United States and the United Kingdom froze Japanese funds, the Japanese side immediately took various retaliatory actions in Shanghai, such as the Japanese consulate announcing regulations to ban transactions involving foreign interests. At the same time, they controlled export trade, banning the export of certain necessities in order to deal a major blow to British and American merchants. Starting from July 28th, the notice issued by Japanese customs officer Mitsuaki Oyamada implemented an embargo on seven types of goods, which was later expanded to eleven types. By the 30th of last month, it was expanded to fifteen types, plunging the export trade in this port into a state of stagnation. It is now known that the so-called fifteen types are: (1) leather, (2) chaff and bran, (3) rice and grains, (4) wheat and flour, (5) dyes, pigments, and paints, (6) edible vegetable oils, (7) rubber, (8) coal, (9) cotton and cotton wool, (10) , (11) wool, (12) mineral sand, (13) metals, (14) machinery and tools, (15) chemicals. However, which specific goods are included in the fifteen categories is reportedly still undecided.

Letter

To the Editor: According to Mr. Wang Yongliang of Wang Yongji Weaving Factory, I recently read a news item titled "Major Fire on Xizang Road Yesterday Morning" in the local news column of the Shenbao, Sino-American Daily, which contained many inaccuracies. The fire did not occur in our factory. The police have conducted an on-site investigation, and the truth will be revealed. Because I was in a state of extreme panic at the time, I was unable to take out my clothes and belongings. My eight-year-old son, Guohai, unfortunately died in the fire. I am heartbroken by this sudden tragedy. There was also an apprentice from Changzhou, a shoemaking apprentice, who has nothing to do with our factory. Please send a letter to stop, etc. I am writing to you on his behalf and hope your newspaper will make a correction. Sincerely, The Editor of Shenbao, Lawyer Zhang Zhiguo, August 2nd.

### Sugarcane and Cane Sugar (1) (Part of China) Gao Jiannong

When sugarcane was transmitted from India to China, we are not sure about this matter either. We only know that in the early third century BC, the Chu state poet Song Yu in his work Summoning the Soul, already had "boiled turtles and roasted lambs, with "some cane juice"," - Zhe is similar to cane, is a total input recognized. - Later, in the mid-second century BC, the Han Dynasty, the composer Sima Xiangru in his Joyful Song, also had "the elder respectfully "cane juice" "folded early wake" sentences, "cane juice" was already widely used, and sugarcane had already been imported into China, of course, no need to waste words. As for the sentences that separately cite sugarcane, there is Sima Xiangru's Shanglin Fu's "sweet cane Ba Ju", Liu Xiang's Staff Inscription's "Du cane - sugarcane alias - although sweet, almost can not be crutched: flattering people please themselves, also can not be relative": there is also Han Zhang Heng's Nandu Fu, Jin Zuo Si's Shudu Fu. However, in addition to the Dongfang Shuo Divine Strange Classic, which is a forgery and does not need attention, there is no text describing the shape of sugarcane that is clearer and more valuable than Jin Ji Han's Southern Grass and Tree Shape in the late third century AD. It said: "Sugarcane "Giaozhi, those born are several inches in circumference, more than ten feet long, quite similar to bamboo, broken and eaten, very sweet?..." (To be continued)

### Report on Inspector Chen's Visit from the Ministry of Education: Advances in Higher Education in Zhejiang and Fujian, Students Vigorous, Education Serious, Equipment Complete

(Hengyang Correspondence) Chen Panzao, Counselor of the Ministry of Education, was ordered to inspect higher education in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces in February of this year. He has now completed his official duties and has returned to Chongqing via Jiangxi and Guangdong to report on his mission. He made the following remarks, briefly stating that the state of higher education in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces is generally satisfactory. In terms of quantity and distribution, Zhejiang Province has the Longquan branch of National Zhejiang University, Zhejiang Provincial Yingshi University, and the Provincial Medical and Pharmaceutical School. The old Zhejiang University Art School and Zhijiang University, among others, are still operating in Guizhou, Sichuan, and Shanghai and have not yet moved back. Higher education in Fujian Province appears to be more developed, with National Xiamen University, Private Union College, Private Hwa-En Women's College of Arts and Sciences, Private Fukien College, Provincial Medical and Agricultural College, Provincial Music School, Su-Wan Joint Political Science College, and the Provincial Normal School, which will soon be formally established, totaling nine institutions. Additionally, there is a Provincial Research Institute, the highest academic institution.

In terms of content, although the Zhejiang University branch and Yingshi University in Zhejiang Province were only recently established, they are quite vigorous, and their teaching methods are relatively novel and earnest. There are currently many students, and all internal facilities are managed in accordance with the central government's intentions. The equipment is also barely adequate. The Provincial Medical and Pharmaceutical School has a longer history and can be considered suitable in terms of both management and actual conditions. Xiamen University in Fujian, originally a famous institution in the southeast, has not only improved its administrative efficiency since being converted into a national university in 1937 but has also implemented various plans systematically, and its equipment is more complete than that of other inland institutions. Most gratifyingly, the number of students has increased dramatically, worthy of being the highest academic institution in the southeastern half of the country. The Union College, run by the American Church, has become increasingly sophisticated in its content and spirit since moving to Shaowu and has provided much assistance to the local community. Its progress is not only outstanding among general church schools, but there are probably not many public and private universities in the mainland today that can compare to it. Other private schools such as South China and Fukien each have their strengths and weaknesses, but are generally not bad. Furthermore, the Provincial Medical and Agricultural College and the two specialized schools of Music and Normal Education were established by the authorities to cultivate appropriate specialists, so they have particularly ample funding and have recruited many specialized professors. If they continue to advance in this order, there is much hope for progress.

The Su-Wan Joint Political Science College also has good content and spirit and is no less inferior to newly established universities in general. Although the name of the Provincial Research Institute does not comply with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, its purpose is quite relevant, and its funding is also very ample. The social science department of the institute is entrusted to the relevant departments of Xiamen University, while the natural science department runs research institutes for agriculture, engineering, medicine, mining, metallurgy, etc. The research centers and various ongoing plans that have been formulated are all in line with the needs of the province. Currently, students in various provincial institutions in Fujian Province enjoy the privilege of having all tuition, board, lodging, and miscellaneous fees waived, which is a great benefit to young people. It is feared that students at other national institutions may not have this luxury. Over the past decade, I have been ordered to inspect education in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, and this is my fourth trip, so I have a thorough understanding of the actual situation. In summary, I have three impressions from this trip: (1) Zhejiang Province, due to environmental factors, does not have as much funding as Fujian Province, and the scope of its operations is smaller, so it may be difficult to expand it as much as possible for the time being. (2) Zhejiang and Fujian provinces are both under the threat of the Japanese army on three sides, but they have been able to achieve such a good phenomenon of steady progress, not neglecting the cultivation of specialists and being able to promote planned and orderly development, which is truly commendable. (3) The spirit and determination of the two provinces in developing educational and cultural undertakings are no less than in improving other general administrative affairs, and the results are also particularly remarkable, which is quite comforting to the people of the country, he said.

Ministry of Education Establishes Overseas Chinese Normal School in Changting

(Yongan, 1st) Overseas Chinese leader Chen Jiageng, due to the lack of teachers in Nanyang, previously suggested establishing a normal school in China to train teachers for overseas Chinese schools. The Ministry of Education has approved his request and has chosen to open a school in Changting, Fujian, which will be able to enroll students and begin classes in mid-September.

Youth Association Holds Children's Carnival

The Children's Reading Room attached to the Chinese Christian Youth Association has been very popular since it opened on June 22nd. In order to regulate children's lives, the association provides proper books for children to read and also offers singing, drama, storytelling, and news reports. It has also decided to hold a children's carnival every other week. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., the association held its third carnival in the auditorium of the Youth Association in Baxianqiao. In addition to songs, plays, and other recreational programs, there were also educational films, which were very exciting. The event was attended by a large crowd of children.

School News

Zhaohe Middle School Zhaohe Middle School was established to commemorate the Zhaohe Uprising. In order to cultivate young students, it offers four types of free education: free places for Zhaohe descendants, grants for those with the surname Chu, free places for outstanding students from poor families, and excellent awards for free students. Starting last semester, it added free places for first-place students to encourage students to study hard.

The entrance examination is scheduled for August 10th. Students from poor families with excellent grades are welcome to apply.

Huaijiu Girls' Middle School Due to the large number of students, Huaijiu Girls' Middle School in the city has been divided into north and south sections. This semester, the number of applicants has increased even further, so it has been decided to maintain the original state and hold full-day classes, with a slight increase in the number of hours for major subjects such as Chinese, mathematics, and English. The school will also be more strict in examining academic performance and in guidance management. It has been reported that the second entrance examination will be held on the 3rd of this month.

### Talking about Courage

— Li Yi

Little Friends! What is courage? Is it boldly doing bad things? Is it stubbornly ignoring other people's advice and fighting with people? No, these behaviors are obstinacy; obstinacy and courage are absolutely different. Obstinacy is an irrational act, while courage is a rational, clear, and pure behavior. In other words, courage is a virtue of sacrificing oneself without fear or retreat.

However, there are many kinds of courage! When the country is in danger, citizens rise up together, braving artillery fire to do their best for the country, this is courage; in addition, when something happens, a third party bravely acts righteously, rescuing the unfortunate on the one hand and striking the tyrannical on the other, this is also courage; furthermore, seeing someone fall into the water, quickly rescuing them, seeing an elderly person in trouble, quickly helping them, this is also courage; even more so, if you have done something wrong, admit it frankly and quickly correct yourself, this is also courage; as for studying diligently, when you come to society, overcoming endless difficulties, tasting profound pain, seeking happiness for the people, and establishing immortal achievements for yourself, this is also courage!

So the object of courage is very diverse, it all depends on how you choose! The most shameful and hateful people in the world are the cowardly and weak people; these people are not only waste products of humanity, but also pests of society!

Little friends! Do you ask yourself if you are brave or not? Which of the above kinds of courage do you belong to?

### Summer Vacation Life of Rural Children

— Ying Dai

Little friends, since the summer vacation began, almost a month has passed in the blink of an eye. Do you know what the summer vacation life of rural children is like in the city? This time, because I took advantage of the holidays to spend the summer in the countryside, I want to report the summer vacation life of rural children to the little friends in Shanghai so that you can know how children spend this summer vacation in the countryside.

Just like you, rural children also have a nearly two-month-long vacation during the summer. Except for a small number of children who go to summer cram schools, reading for half a day every morning, or have teachers come to their homes to tutor them, most children do not study and spend the two months of summer vacation unknowingly.

Of course, not studying all day long requires finding some things to pass the time, otherwise it would be too boring. In the countryside, there are no cinemas or Beijing opera houses, so general children have to find their own entertainment or things to amuse themselves. During this summer season, the most common things that rural children do are probably fishing and catching cicadas!

Using bamboo to make fishing rods, heating sewing needles with fire to bend them, and tying them to the line, all fishing equipment is made by the children themselves. Standing under the willow tree, putting some bait on the hook, such as flies and rice bugs! Throwing it into the water, and seeing a fish bite the hook, they pick up the bamboo pole, and a lively fish is caught. If they do well! They can catch dozens of fish in less than half a day, it's quite flavorful!

As for cicadas, they can be seen everywhere in the countryside. Children use spiderwebs or grease made from tung oil, putting it on bamboo poles. Seeing cicadas perched on large trees by the river or in the garden, they gently extend the bamboo poles to the place where the cicadas are hiding, and with quick eyes and hands, they poke accurately and can stick the cicadas and catch them to take home to play with.

That's how it is during the day. Once night falls, many children gather in the courtyard to enjoy the cool, telling stories. They are happy to play hide-and-seek and snatch corners under the moon. Some also take glass bottles, and seeing fireflies flying by, they use palm-leaf fans to swat them down and catch a bottle, which is shiny and very beautiful. In a few more days, cricket mothers, spinning ladies, crickets, etc. will all appear, and the children will be busy catching these things again!

### Reading "Father's Caretaker"

Le'an Elementary School

Five Below Jiang Yuanxi Gu Qiufang

During the summer vacation, in addition to doing the homework assigned by the teachers, we read "Education of Love". Yesterday, we read an article "Father's Caretaker".

The main character in this story is an Italian boy, Xixiluo. The content describes everything he did to welcome his father, who had just returned from working abroad.

His father returned, but before he arrived home, he fell ill in the Nampurs Hospital. Xixiluo went to welcome him, but mistakenly recognized an old worker who had also returned from working abroad, who was very ill. Xixiluo took very good care of him.

After Xixiluo discovered his real father, he was truly filled with mixed feelings of grief and joy, but he refused to go back with his father, who was recovering. He said to his father: "You see, he is looking at me there? If I leave, he will die."

Xixiluo still served the old man in the same way, still taking care of him with all his heart, until the old man died with a smile.

Xixiluo is truly a good child. After reading this article, our hearts were greatly moved, because where can we do Xixiluo's kind of moving filial piety and all the spirit of enduring hardship to serve the unfortunate sick?

Therefore, we must learn from Xixiluo, be filial to our parents, love our friends, and serve the world and mankind.

Little friends, "Education of Love" is an extracurricular reading material that is most suitable for our elementary school students. We recommend that everyone read this book. If you see good books, also tell us in the Children's Weekly!

### Making Soda

— Yang Chunlv

Last Sunday, my younger brother ate cold noodles made with agar-agar and found them cool and delicious. Today, he asked his mother to make them again. His mother said: "Although cold noodles are delicious, they are not as good as soda for quenching thirst and relieving heat, and they are also good for the body. We might as well make a bottle of soda to drink, and we can also change the taste."

So, my mother took a bottle with a glass ball stopper, and prepared boiled water, tartaric acid, sodium bicarbonate (commonly known as baking soda), lemon oil, and saccharin. When making it, she first put five parts each of tartaric acid and baking soda in the bottle, then added a few drops of lemon oil, a little saccharin, and then poured in boiled water, quickly covering the mouth of the bottle with her hand and turning it upside down, so that the glass ball stopper would firmly close the mouth of the bottle.

My younger brother watched his mother make it with rapt attention and found it very interesting. After his mother finished making it, he asked, "Is the soda made like this exactly the same as the soda sold in the market?"

His mother said, "The soda factories use sulfuric acid instead of tartaric acid; some also use stone powder instead of baking soda. They also add various fruit juices or other flavoring agents, so the taste is more delicious. And the manufacturing methods, whether it is filtering water, making gas, or bottling, all use machines, so they can produce in large quantities."

After a while, his mother used force to open the bottle stopper and poured it into a cup, and many bubbles formed. My younger brother drank it and asked, "Mom, why are there so many bubbles in the soda?"

His mother replied, "Because the baking soda put in the soda reacts with the tartaric acid, it produces a large amount of carbonic acid gas. When the bottle cap is opened, it becomes a bubble and immediately escapes. Therefore, soda should be drunk immediately after it is poured out, otherwise the carbonic acid gas will escape and the effect will be less."

My younger brother asked in surprise. "Carbonic acid gas? I heard the teacher at school say that it is harmful to us. Now we drink soda and swallow a lot of carbonic acid gas, is it okay?"

His mother explained, "That's right, if a large amount of carbonic acid gas is inhaled into the lungs, it is indeed harmful, and may even cause suffocation and death. But if it is mixed with a drink and swallowed into the stomach, its acidity can actually aid digestion."

### Three "Whys?"

— Lin Ren

It had been a long time since I had been to my grandmother's house. So Aliang's mother chose a cloudy afternoon and took Aliang to visit his grandmother's house.

Aliang's grandmother's house had recently added a refrigerator, which caught Aliang's eye, and he thought it was so novel at the time: a square and large wooden box, painted white on the outside, with two doors that could be opened and closed on the top and sides. He curiously pulled the top cover hard, only to see an concave tin plate inside, with a rectangular block of machine ice placed in the recessed area, surrounded by many wood shavings; the raised tin sheet had many small holes. When he opened the lid, a gust of cold air rushed to his face, making him shiver. He opened the door below and saw many things inside, like soda, fruit, etc., and many dewdrops grew on the soda bottles. He was overjoyed to see it, and he seemed to have discovered something new today, but "Why is the ice in the refrigerator placed on top? Why is the ice hidden in wood shavings? Why are there dewdrops on the soda bottles?" Aliang asked these three "whys" in a row. He certainly couldn't turn one "why" into two "becauses", and no one at his grandmother's house could answer these "whys". So before dinner, he asked his mother to go back.

His grandmother initially tried her best to keep him and his mother for dinner, but seeing that Aliang was so insistent, she didn't force them to stay.

As soon as Aliang stepped into the door, he hurried to find his father to ask him to solve these "whys".

"The first why is the ice placed on the top of the refrigerator? Because the ice in the refrigerator can cool the air around it, but cold air is heavier and sinks to the bottom of the refrigerator, and hot air is lighter and is driven to the top of the refrigerator by the sinking cold air, and the ice then cools the hot air again and sinks down again, so the air circulates in the refrigerator. The ice is placed on the top of the refrigerator to take advantage of the point that cold air sinks and hot air rises, so that it can circulate continuously and completely cool all the air in the refrigerator. This is the reason for the first 'why'. The second why is the ice hidden in wood shavings? You need to know that the temperature in summer is very high, often around ninety degrees, but the temperature of ice is low. Ice is very easy to melt in the summer, and the effect of ice disappears, so you have to hide the ice in wood shavings, because wood shavings are not easy to conduct heat, so you can save the ice for some time and not dissolve very quickly. The third why is there dewdrops on the soda bottles? The temperature of the soda bottles in the refrigerator is very low. Once the water vapor in the air comes into contact with these cold soda bottles, it condenses into many dewdrops. This is the reason for the third 'why'. Speaking of making the ice not dissolve quickly, in addition to hiding it in wood shavings, there is another method: that is to put salt on the ice, because salt and ice together can make the temperature even lower, lower than the temperature of pure ice, so it is not easy to dissolve into water. But it is actually wrong to put wood shavings in the refrigerator at my grandmother's house, because when the ice dissolves, it absorbs the heat in the refrigerator, so that the temperature inside can be lowered, so that the things in the ice will not spoil. If you hide the ice in wood shavings, the ice will not dissolve, but the temperature in the box will not be lowered, so the things in the ice cannot be kept fresh. Next time you go to your grandmother's house, you must tell them this principle."

### The Marital Turmoil of Miss Shu Rocks the Capital

— Reflection

Shu Xiuwen has left and left again, making it difficult for her husband! Wang Shizhen's tears and laughter are due to cause and effect.

(Chongqing Dispatch) Before the war, when Shu Xiuwen was still an actress at the Star Film Company, she once proposed a permanent separation from her husband, Pan Zienong, due to dissatisfaction with their life. Later, thanks to the mediation of Zhou Jianyun, Xu Xingzhi, and others, they were able to live in peace. However, not long after, Shu Xiuwen suddenly asked lawyer Zhu Sifu to send a letter to her husband, demanding an unconditional termination of their marital relationship. As a result, friendly mediation failed, and thus,

Wang Broke the Frame But before this incident had even unfolded for long, news spread that Xiuwen was passionately in love with Wang Shizhen, a photographer at the same company. Coincidentally, Wang had gone to Hankou on business, and it was at this time that Shu Xiuwen secretly followed him to Hankou. Soon after, they both went to Hong Kong, never to return. Afterwards, according to insiders, this was all a

Cleverly Conceived Plan The truth of which could not be verified. Soon, they traveled from Hong Kong to Kunming and other places, honeymooning while continuing their respective work. Later, they were invited by the Chongqing China Film Studio, so the two took a plane to Chongqing to live their beautiful and ideal life. However, not even a year after arriving in Chongqing, news of marital disputes was frequently heard. At first, friends thought this was inevitable between couples, so they didn't interfere. Unexpectedly, as time went on, the disputes became more intense, even leading to a separation of more than two months, with each living at a friend's place. Friends

Mediated From Within Urging them to reconcile, but to no avail. The husband claimed that his wife had found someone else and didn't return home at night, while the wife claimed that her husband didn't care about his health and made friends indiscriminately. Both sides insisted on their own versions of the story. Friends couldn't blindly judge who was right or wrong, and seeing that their positions seemed unusually firm, they stopped interfering. Recent news has revealed that they have indeed

Signed a Divorce Agreement The truth is that on the evening of July 4th, they entrusted lawyer Luo Qilan to formally sign the divorce agreement, with Wang Shizhen paying the woman 1,500 yuan for three months of living expenses. Now, this marital change has finally been resolved smoothly, but it has caused a stir throughout the capital. Some say: The film industry is truly incredible. At the same time, there was Zhou Yan's marital change in the isolated island, and Shu Wang's marital change in the capital. Though separated by mountains, these marital changes are not isolated incidents. The film circle can be considered to be going through eventful times. Yesterday, Ms. Li asked her agent, Wu Yongzi, to visit, saying that Ms. Li greatly approves of the Shen Bao's student aid fund, and has specially donated 400 yuan from the advertising fees of a certain product, plus an additional 100 yuan, with 300 yuan for student aid and 200 yuan for the orphanage, to do her part for "Save the Children." I was greatly moved upon hearing this! Her praiseworthy and compassionate heart for children is the first of its kind among film people, and it will surely move the sympathy of people inside and outside the film circle. "The heart of compassion is in everyone." Ms. Li can appreciate the virtues of the ancients and put them into practice, which is admirable. This is written in acknowledgement.

Chapter 13: Refusing to Lower One's Head in the Wilderness

Zhang Cangqiu: "How could I dare? I am always thinking about you and Li, my brother. Why didn't he come with you? Is your hometown peaceful?" Xu Jing sighed and said, "Although we have been separated for only a short time, there have been great changes in that time, enough to make one feel sentimental." He then briefly told Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei about the situation after they left Qixian County, from the bandit Hong Niangzi attacking the city at Green Stone Mountain and Li Xin being captured, to him joining the army in Daizhou and the fierce battle in Ningwu, as well as how he met Liu Yinying. Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei sat by and listened, sometimes laughing loudly, sometimes sighing sadly, sometimes gesticulating wildly, and sometimes weeping bitterly. They were extremely moved by General Zhou Yuji's heroic defense of Ningwu and his sacrifice for righteousness. Finally, Xu Jing briefly stated his and Liu Yinying's desire to join them and asked Zhang and Chen to speak to General Wu and have them enlisted. Zhang Cangqiu nodded and said, "This matter will definitely succeed with me. Now is the time when people are needed. It is rare that you two have come here, and we can work together to support the royal family. However, General Wu is not here, and Guerrilla Officer Chai Ying cannot make a decision. Wait a few days, General Wu will return, and then I will introduce you to him." Xu Jing said, "Thank you for your trouble, brother." Zhang Cangqiu then said, "You and Mr. Xu have come a long way and must be tired from your journey. You need to rest. This place is not suitable for a long chat. Please come with me to the barracks, where I and my brother will prepare some wine and dishes to wash away your fatigue." Xu Jing was not polite and said, "Very good, very good." Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei then led the two away from the General's Office and back to the East City barracks. Their barracks were behind the Xuantan Temple, built a long time ago, the houses were half new and half old, with many flags planted, and there were guards standing at the camp gate, making it look majestic and solemn. Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei accompanied the two into the camp gate, but took a detour along a small path on the left to their private resting place, which was a very bright room, simply furnished, but clean. Zhang Cangqiu invited Xu Jing and Liu Yinying to sit down on the chairs, and then he called over a horse boy and instructed him to prepare wine and dishes. (132)

### Scenes from the Artistic World

China United to Produce Films in Large Quantities China United Film Company will greatly increase its production in the second half of the year to meet the needs of the six major theaters: Xinhua, Huguang, Xinguang, Jincheng, and Quan Delian. Zhang Shankun, the owner of China United, specially hosted a banquet for all the directors for this matter. It is reported that each director will be responsible for all production work in addition to directing the film, that is, the director must fully command the scenery, props, costumes, etc., which is similar to the nature of a production director, so that the production can increase its speed.

Yi Hua Starts Filming New Films After "The Merry Widow," Li Qinian's new works, "Modern Youth" and "Forever," are being filmed simultaneously. Lu Luming, after completing "Female Zombie," also plays the lead role in "Forever." Ye Yifang's "Thief Beauty" will be directed by Li Pingqian, with Li Qinian as the female lead. This film is scheduled to start filming this month. After completing "Red Powder Thief," Li Lihua will star in a new detective film, "Full City Storm," directed by Yan Youxiang himself.

Golden Star Films Peach Blossom Lake Golden Star's first work after the move, "Peach Blossom Lake," is scheduled to begin filming next Monday, and all major actors have been assigned. "Peach Blossom Lake" is one of the posthumous works of Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, and it is also the collaborative crystallization of Cai Chusheng and Yan Heming when they first entered the film industry. Now, Zheng Xiaoqiu is the director, and Yan Heming is responsible for the production. The younger generation pushes the older generation forward, which is also a small change.

Dragon Gate Opening Date Approaching The Dragon Gate Theater, rebuilt from the Green Bao Dance Hall, will open around the 20th of this month. The male actors are Shu Shi, Huang He, and others, and the female lead is planned to be Bai Hong. Although Bai Hong has a basic contract with Golden Star, there is no problem as long as it does not interfere with filming. It is said that Ju Manhua will also be hired as a regular actor, but the possibility is less likely.
