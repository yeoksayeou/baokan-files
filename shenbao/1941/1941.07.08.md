### Central Government Commemorates the Fourth Anniversary of the War of Resistance with a Military Review and Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers; Chongqing City Adorned with Flags, Government Offices Maintain Normal Operations, National Defense Exhibition and Round Table Conferences Held

This morning's ceremonies in Chongqing commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War were temporarily disrupted by Japanese aircraft. Twenty-seven Japanese planes fiercely bombed the western suburbs, their primary target seemingly the press hostel, which has been bombed repeatedly. Foreign correspondents are currently residing in this hostel. A large bomb landed near the hostel, and another landed directly in front of its entrance, causing a fire. Several bombs also fell along the Yangtze River. It was found that last night, twenty-three Japanese planes, divided into three groups, bombed this area, concentrating their bombs on the courtyard where the press hostel is located. One bomb scored a direct hit, destroying the dining room. Another exploded on the lawn ten yards from the hostel entrance. A third bomb landed but did not detonate. Another bomb landed outside the entrance of an air raid shelter, where the flash of the explosion could be seen inside. Those taking shelter were greatly shaken, but fortunately, there were no casualties. However, one person nearby was killed by the bombing. Today, the city is adorned with flags, and government offices are maintaining normal operations. Unlike previous years, entertainment venues are not closed, but the performances are all patriotic dramas. A military review was held in the morning, presided over by Propaganda Minister Wang Shijie. After the review, Social Affairs Minister Gu Zhenggang conducted a simple memorial service for the fallen soldiers. Three national defense exhibitions are being held in the city, and round table conferences are being held in multiple locations to discuss the development of the international situation. The National Relief Commission has dispatched several groups to visit the families of frontline soldiers, distributing gifts and letters. (Reuters, 7th)

### Fierce Fighting Erupts Southwest of Zhao'an

### The Times Praises China's Heroic Resistance

London: The Times today published an editorial commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, stating that China has now sent one of its most outstanding talents, Wellington Koo, to be its representative in the heart of the democratic resistance against rampant violence. Koo will be the "spokesman for countries continuing to resist aggression." While the experiences of many Western countries have been tragic, it is questionable whether any country other than Poland has suffered the systematic brutality experienced by China. The paper also stated that, along with the bravery of the Chinese army and the long-term endurance of the Chinese people, the indomitable spirit of the Chinese leaders is worthy of admiration. The Matsuoka-Soviet Pact has not shaken General Chiang Kai-shek's determination, as he has maintained a firm attitude of non-compromise since the outbreak of the war, just like British Prime Minister Churchill. This proves that both the pessimists on the Chinese side and the optimists on the Japanese side have overestimated the importance of this agreement. Soviet aid to China may be reduced due to Hitler's great interest in invading Soviet territory, but the Soviet Union is now fighting on the same side as China, Britain, and the United States. In any case, the truce between the Chinese government and the Communist army in China is unlikely to be broken again, as Japan hopes. Loans from Britain and the United States, and the British ambassador's firm assurance that the Burma Road will remain open, are effective counterattacks against Japanese propaganda and provide great comfort to worried Chinese. The Chinese deeply believe that their future stability and prosperity are linked to Western democracy, and they now hope to receive greater assistance. The leaders of the English-speaking world deeply admire this long-standing and unconquerable people for their long and glorious resistance, and they will carefully study how to assist them in their struggle.

### American Newspapers Unanimously Praise China's Growing Strength

New York: In today's commemoration of the fourth anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, the comments from various newspapers in the Scripps-Howard chain across the United States all say, "China is stronger than before, while Japan is weakening." The newspapers' comments also state, "The result of the aggression is that China has gained a truly national army and national spirit for the first time in history. The supposedly disunited China now wants to defend itself and tomorrow may challenge Japanese aggression elsewhere and liberate the neighboring peoples of Manchuria, Korea, and Vietnam." (United Press, 7th)

Washington: Paul V. McNutt, the US Federal Security Administrator, who has always advocated a strong Far East policy, addressed Chinese groups here today on the fourth anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, praising China's successful resistance. He said, "The time to clarify the Pacific problem has come." He predicted China's final victory, which would result in the restoration of peace in the Far East. (United Press, 7th)

### Japanese Invasion of China for Four Years Causes Major Economic Panic

Tokyo: Editorials in local newspapers today all discussed the significance of Japan's four years of fighting in China. The Foreign Ministry's official newspaper, Japan Public Knowledge News, stated that Japan has weathered the storm. Its position after four years of fighting is the best evidence of the efficiency and ability of the nation. After four years of fighting, there are two phenomena: one is the rapid progress of reconstruction in China after the ravages of war, and the other is the gradual increase in the Japanese side's methods of fighting and defense behind the front lines. Japan's protracted war in China has undoubtedly affected the economic and social life of the Japanese people, and although it has suffered damage and hardship during the four years of fighting, Japan is far stronger and more productive today than it was four years ago. (Reuters, 7th)

Editorial

### Clearing Up the Speculative Market

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council took on the responsibility of transporting and selling foreign rice, the price of rice in Shanghai has stabilized, and the general population that was crying out for food has been able to catch their breath slightly. The Shanghai Municipal Council's determination, willpower, and swift methods are truly commendable.

However, the lesson that the people have learned from the rising rice prices over the past few months has not only prevented them from becoming the starving dead trampled under the feet of the wealthy merchants due to hunger and cold, but it has also promoted the cultivation of civic spirit and frugality. This can almost be said to be a blessing in disguise! However, rice is one of the necessary conditions for life, and there are many other problems related to food, clothing, housing, and transportation that urgently need to be solved.

If the recent soaring price of coal is any indication, the cruel impact on the lives of citizens is no different from that of rice; and when examining the reasons for the soaring price, there is nothing that can be established except for speculation and monopolies. Since coal from various places along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line to this city, as well as fuel coal from coastal defense areas, can be continuously transported to Shanghai to meet the market demand. If merchants are obsessed and use excuses to raise prices, then the concession authorities can only resolutely and decisively take over the exclusive sale of coal and prevent speculation in daily necessities. The crux of the problem today lies entirely in the manipulation of distribution, rather than a problem of insufficient supply.

Furthermore, the supply of water and electricity and public transportation fares have recently been increased repeatedly. The citizens are suffering from the burden of not being able to afford it. It is found that the income of each of these companies has had a surplus every year, but they still think that they are not satisfied and must satisfy their predetermined profits. This truly runs counter to the purpose and morality of business operations in extraordinary times. It is also something that is not allowed by any country.

Furthermore, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the landlords in this city have been able to deeply understand the greater good and have not raised rents. The court's mediation of rent disputes also takes the livelihood of the people as the premise, so the citizens have benefited greatly. However, recently there have been many people advocating for the revaluation of land prices to serve as a basis for enriching tax revenue. If this is the case, then the increase in rent is inevitable, and it goes without saying that the burden will be shifted to the citizens.

In summary, each of the above points has a direct and significant relationship with the lives of the people and must be corrected one by one in order to guide life on the right track. The reason why the lives of the citizens of Shanghai have been in such a serious situation must be blamed on the speculative transactions of the stock exchange in this city. Let us present the current situation to prove our point. Although margin trading, foreign exchange, raw cotton, stocks, and public bonds may have occasional arbitrage and investment transactions, they do not seem to be regarded as gambling-style speculation, but when examining the actual situation, nine out of ten are gambling. Traders have absolutely no desire to receive cash or deliver goods, but are absolutely buying long and selling short to make a profit from the difference between the entry and exit prices. The largest scale of such transactions is the trading of margin trading (commonly known in the market as "hot red" or "strips"). According to recent estimates by experts, the funds for margin trading are between 200 million yuan and 250 million yuan, and the highest estimate is 600 million yuan. According to the spot goods of margin trading in Shanghai, there are about 5,000 strips (each strip weighing ten taels), and the daily margin trading, whether long (buying long) or short (selling short), always exceeds 50,000 strips. If each strip is calculated at a market price of 6,500 yuan, and one day's trading is based on 10,000 strips, then the daily trading volume is 65 million yuan; compared with the weekly trading volume of 30 million yuan in Shanghai stock trading (this is the figure for the first week of June), there is a world of difference. Even the trading of the foreign exchange market cannot be compared with margin trading; recently, the long positions of margin trading that were made up due to the short positions of 10 million yuan in US exchange are only a very small part of the monthly margin trading.

There is no doubt that the above-mentioned margin trading market is the champion of various speculative transactions. From an economic point of view, speculative transactions were originally not objectionable and have their uses; however, the transactions in the Shanghai market are not all speculation with economic functions, and most of them are harmful gambling that harms the lives of the people. We have analyzed them briefly above. This is why the speculative market in Shanghai must be cleared up. Furthermore, the margin trading affects people's hearts, even making them lose their minds for profit; other businesses also follow suit. All of this is caused by the margin trading. Therefore, if we want to clear up speculation in Shanghai and stabilize the lives of millions of residents, we must not succeed in banning the speculative transactions of the margin trading market. When the Shanghai Municipal Council raised the issue of revenue and expenditure in the past, there were no shortage of Westerners who suggested imposing heavy taxes on margin trading and all speculative transactions, prohibiting them through taxation, killing two birds with one stone, but unfortunately, it has not been implemented.

In the past two years, the concessions in Shanghai have been able to present an abnormally developed prosperity by means of speculative transactions, because the five million people who fled to the concessions have been able to directly or indirectly assist in supporting the speculative market. The maintenance of speculative transactions depends on the willingness of women, children, and retail investors to take out their wallets and make a desperate bet, just like birds and sparrows being hunted by hawks and eagles. It is also like a fish that can swallow a boat, which depends entirely on the water to help it. Now the pool water has dried up, and the fish that can swallow a boat has no place to use its force. When it waits for its downfall, the cruelty of the market reaction cannot be described in words!

After decades of exploitation by various parties in Shanghai, the foundation of speculation has long been shaken; in recent years, it has been temporarily active due to the stimulation of hot money, but the imminent end of speculation has long been recognized by the wise. If the concession authorities can plan with all relevant parties as soon as possible, stop gambling-style transactions, and establish a model for a normal life in Shanghai, then it may not be too late to benefit from the setting sun; otherwise, if it is allowed to change naturally and cause a reaction, the harm and disaster it will cause are truly unspeakable and unbearable.

### He Yingqin Reviews the War Situation of the Past Four Years; Expresses Optimism About the Future of the War; Strong Chinese Air Force Has Shot Down Thousands of Japanese Aircraft; Significant Progress Has Been Made in Political, Economic, and Transportation Construction

Chongqing: The Sino-Japanese War has now lasted four years. Minister of the Army He Yingqin recently published an article reviewing the fourth year of the war and expressing optimism about the future of the war. He said that although the Japanese have repeatedly attempted to break through the Chinese army's front lines in recent months, the Chinese army is still firmly defending the 2,800-mile-long front line from north to south. It is estimated that by the end of 1940, the Japanese had suffered more than 1.6 million casualties in China. The Chinese army has more than 300 divisions, totaling 5 million people on the ground, and there are another 10 million reserve soldiers or those undergoing training in the rear. There are more than 800,000 guerrillas harassing Japanese troops and transportation lines, and no fewer than 600,000 regular troops fighting behind Japanese lines. The greatest victory of the Chinese army in the fourth year was the battle in early February of this year. At that time, the Japanese army divided its troops into three routes and invaded southern Henan, penetrating 280 miles in a week, but once the supply line was stretched, the Chinese army launched a counterattack and recovered all the lost territory in a week, inflicting heavy casualties of 20,000 on the enemy. According to official figures released by the Chinese Air Force, the Chinese side has destroyed more than 1,000 Japanese aircraft in the four years of the Sino-Japanese War, of which 321 were shot down by Chinese aircraft, 250 were destroyed on the ground, 170 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, 136 were shot down by land defense forces, 97 were destroyed by guerrillas, and 45 crashed behind or near Chinese army lines. The number of Japanese aircraft that were damaged and unable to return to their defenses and those that crashed behind their own lines were not included in this number. The Chinese side captured 54 Japanese pilots and found more than 1,200 Japanese pilot corpses. The Chinese Air Force is temporarily inactive except for a few bombing raids, but it may take the offensive again this summer. American pilots who have come to China to serve according to the American aid-to-China program are already on their way. The Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, as the highest governing body, held two congresses this year, one in July 1940, the Seventh National Congress, and the eighth in March and April of this year. According to the decision of the congress, the Central Planning Bureau and the Party and Government Work Inspection Committee were established. The former prepares and studies plans for various political, economic, and post-war reconstruction programs, and the latter reviews the achievements of the party and government. The Executive Yuan also established an economic conference to coordinate the affairs of relevant departments. The most important bill passed by the Eighth National Congress was the three-year plan for wartime construction. This plan specifies the start of implementation, and the six months from July to December of this year are the preparatory period. The main purpose of this move is to increase China's ability to fight, build during wartime, and build after the war. The National Assembly, which was postponed due to the war in 1937, was originally scheduled to be convened in Chongqing on November 12, 1940, but due to inconvenient transportation and other reasons, it was postponed again, so the National Political Council was reorganized and expanded to temporarily replace the work of the National Assembly during the war. At the same time, the government is also promoting local autonomy procedures, establishing provincial assemblies and implementing the new county system. It is expected that they will be implemented one after another by the end of next year. Although two-thirds of China's railways are in Japanese hands, China is rushing to build new railways and highways in the interior. Since the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was cut off, the Burma Road has been the only supplier to China. At the beginning of this year, the Chinese and British governments agreed to build the Yunnan-Burma Railway from the border to [lacuna] with British capital. The Longhai Railway has been extended in the northwest, and another branch line connects Xi'an with the [lacuna] coal area. New railways in the five provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, and Sichuan are also being laid. It is estimated that there are currently at least 6,000 trucks traveling on newly built highways such as the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway, the Sichuan-Xikang Highway, the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway, and the Xikang-Yunnan Highway. The international airline routes operated by the Sino-American Aviation Corporation include the Chongqing-Hong Kong line and the Chongqing-Yangon line, allowing Chongqing to reach San Francisco in eight days, New York and Washington in nine days, Calcutta in two days, Europe via the Americas in eleven days, Singapore in two days, and Sydney in seven days. A new air route to India is also being planned. China's ancient post stations have now been restored. The government is now using manpower and livestock to transport goods along the ten major post roads of 20,000 kilometers in 13 provinces, reaching 100,000 tons per year, and there are more than 15,000 ships currently traveling on inland rivers, with a total load of 250,000 tons. There are currently 66,000 post offices in the free zone, of which 6,000 are newly opened. The postal route is a total of 500,000 kilometers. The number of 73,000 kilometers of telegraph lines in China before the war has now been almost exceeded by the number of lines in the free zone alone. Since the beginning of the war, 33,000 kilometers of new lines have been planted, and another 12,000 kilometers are currently being worked on. The installation of long-distance telephone lines in the northwestern and southwestern provinces is also being promoted. The National Resources Commission has established more than 70 industrial factories in various parts of China, including 29 for industry, 22 for mining, and 20 for machinery. With government assistance, 450 factories have moved to the interior, with a total of 116,275 tons of equipment. Coal mines in the interior now produce 500,000 tons per year. It is reported that the oil wells in Gansu have greatly increased oil production. Iron mines in Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces alone produce more than 250,000 tons of iron per year. Yunnan province produces 10,000 tons of tin per year. The tung oil production in the interior can be increased to 1.3 million dan in five years. Tea production in Sichuan and Xikang provinces can reach 500,000 dan in five years. The silk production in the southwest is expected to reach 160,000 tons. The ports in the free zone had a trade surplus in 1940, with imports of 57,209,000 yuan and exports of 137,184,000 yuan. The center of trade has now shifted from Hong Kong to Yangon. In 1940, China's tung oil exports to the United States reached 254,102 metric tons (December rice included). Half of the silk exported from Sichuan province is now purchased by Yangon, and the rest is shipped to the United States. The figures for China's war budget have not been released, but it is reported from official sources that the budget figures for the three years from 1939 to 1941 have greatly increased due to the war. The actual expenditure in 1939 reached the sum of the two years of 1937 and 1938. The expenditure in 1940 increased by 40% compared with the previous year, and the budgeted expenditure for 1941 increased by about 65% compared with 1940. It is found that of the expenditure in 1940, 70% was used for national defense, while of the budgeted expenditure for 1941, 39% was used for war expenses, and the economic construction expenditure also reached 30%. By the end of last year, the government had raised eight domestic public bonds, totaling 14,750,000,000 yuan. As of the end of April this year, savings bonds worth 312,240,000 yuan had been sold. In 1940, the four national banks reported that savings had increased by 1,500,000,000 yuan compared with 1939. The amount of banknotes issued in July 1937 was 1,444,000,000 yuan, and it has gradually increased to seven times that amount. The government is currently collecting land tax in kind, with the land tax revenue before the war reaching 100 million yuan per year. The National Relief Commission is using work as relief to arrange work for 1 million refugees and distributing 11 million yuan to relieve 8,000 war orphans. The 8.5 million overseas Chinese have donated 300 million yuan to China's relief funds from the beginning of the war to the end of 1940, of which one-third came from Southeast Asia. After the start of the war, remittances from overseas Chinese reached 2 billion yuan, and 1 billion yuan was donated in 1940 alone. Chongqing is 1,500 miles from Shanghai and used to have a population of 700,000, but it has been reduced to 400,000 due to Japanese bombing. The most severe bombings were on May 3, 1939, with thousands of casualties, and on August 19 of last year, when 250 Japanese aircraft attacked, four-fifths of the area downstream of Chongqing was reduced to ashes, but new houses were built soon after. There are currently 1,000 air-raid shelters in Chongqing, which can accommodate 40,000 people. There are 32 warning stations watching for Japanese aircraft. It is estimated that in 1939, every two bombs dropped by Japanese aircraft on Chongqing caused 11 casualties. Last year, this number was reduced to two, and this year, every three and a half bombs cause only one casualty. According to official records, the total number of casualties is 8,000. (Reuters, 7th)

### South American Countries Ecuador and Peru Initiate War Due to Border Disputes; Both Countries Mobilize National Armies; Peruvian Aircraft Bomb Five Cities Across the Border

Quito, Ecuador, July 7 (United Press) – Ecuador and Peru, today, shattered the peace of the Western Hemisphere and crushed the efforts of the United States, Argentina, and Brazil to mediate their century-long border dispute, engaging in undeclared warfare along the border. As the border situation worsened, Ecuador mobilized its army, and by the end of this week, armed actions erupted, resulting in five Ecuadorian cities suffering aerial and artillery attacks. A patriotic movement swept across Ecuador yesterday, and the President issued a declaration urging the people to unite under the national flag.

Quito, Ecuador, July 7 (United Press) – Due to disputes over border extensions, after Peru bombarded five Ecuadorian border cities with artillery and aircraft last weekend, Ecuador has mobilized its national army today.

In 1936, arbitration by Washington brought a temporary halt, but now it has resurfaced. According to official sources, on Sunday, Peruvian troops used artillery and aircraft to cover their attacks on five Ecuadorian cities. Border warfare between the two sides is ongoing. Diplomatic authorities from both countries are striving for negotiations before the conflict escalates, but troops continue to concentrate.

### US Labor and Management Reach Compromise; Coal Supply Guaranteed

Washington, July 7 (Reuters) – A steady supply of coal, essential for the US defense industry, is now guaranteed. Southern coal mine owners have signed a two-year contract with miners, similar to that of northern coal mines. As a result, the threatened strike by 150,000 bituminous coal miners in four southern states next Tuesday is averted. The contract stipulates an increase in the basic daily wage from $5.60 to $7.00.

### Japanese Minister of Agriculture Urges Japanese People to Reduce Food Consumption; Successive Years of Poor Harvests Lead to a Sense of Food Shortage, Necessitating Increased Agricultural Control

Tokyo, July 7 (United Press) – The Minister of Agriculture, Ino, broadcasted on the radio, warning the people that Japan may need to further reduce its food consumption in the future. However, he assured that Japan's food supply would be sufficient in any emergency. Ino stated that the food problem often determines the outcome of a war, and the people should endure the hardships of the food problem in order to safely navigate Japan's shortage of rice and food production due to the shortage of farmers and fertilizers, as well as droughts and pests. The government has now adopted a "twelve-year plan" to increase rice and wheat production and will strive to encourage the cultivation of sweet potatoes. The government's plan also includes increasing rice imports from overseas to compensate for the deficiencies of past years. The fertilizer problem is particularly severe, as the German-Soviet war has abruptly disrupted transportation between Germany and Japan. The last European war was decided by the food problem, and the same will be true this time. Japan has suffered successive years of poor harvests, necessitating that the government implement agricultural controls. The sudden changes in the international situation are greatly relevant to Japan and cannot be ignored. We must think carefully to determine the future of the nation. The government has two ways to solve the food problem, and it will implement both simultaneously: one is to increase production under government management, and the other is to reduce consumption under government control. The price limit for rice will also be raised to encourage production and prevent waste.

### British Tobacco Company Encourages People to Smoke Less

London, July 7 (Reuters) – Lord Dulverton, Chairman of the British Imperial Tobacco Company, speaking last night as a representative of the major British tobacco manufacturers, obtained approval from the Board of Trade to broadcast a speech urging smokers to voluntarily reduce their consumption of cigarettes in order to conserve stocks. He stated that if smokers reduce their consumption by twelve percent starting tomorrow for two months, then all cigarette stores will be able to maintain small inventories, avoiding panic buying and hoarding. This is not to discourage the public from smoking after meals or during leisure time, but casual smoking during the day can be reduced. It is best to limit daily consumption to a certain amount to test how much can be reduced. If we are frugal, we will have plenty of cigarettes and tobacco.

### Notion of Dutch Government Moving to America Unlikely to Materialize

### Large Numbers of American Ships Transporting Military Supplies to Reinforce British Forces in the Middle East; No Shortage of Aircraft or Tanks; British Position in the Mediterranean Has Improved

Washington, July 7 (Reuters) – According to official sources familiar with the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act, 20 to 25 ships are currently transporting military supplies to reinforce British forces in the Middle East each month. The goods shipped across the Atlantic and Pacific now include bombers, fighter planes, artillery, ammunition, and new 13-ton tanks. Some of these weapons have already been used on the battlefield, and mechanics have arrived in Egypt to oversee the assembly of aircraft. Officials estimate that it takes 100 days from the time of loading at US ports to the time of unloading in the Red Sea. However, loading is now being expedited, so American military experts are becoming less pessimistic about Britain's chances of maintaining control of the Mediterranean.

### Singapore Supplies Tin and Rubber to the Soviet Union

Singapore, July 7 (United Press) – The Straits Settlements government today declined to comment on reports of rubber and tin being shipped to the Soviet Union. However, market sources said the news was very significant. Although it is unknown who is representing the Soviet Union as the buyer, it is expected that steps will be taken to limit prices. To the level that American buyers currently pay for rubber. Previously, some parties had paid little attention to the tin market, but suddenly there has been a great demand for tin this past week, which is worth noting. Shipping circles claim that although there are large stocks of rubber, two American freighters that left here last week did not carry them, indicating that the stocks have been used for other purposes. Official statistics show that 398,268 tons of rubber were exported in the first half of this year, compared to 365,667 tons in the same period last year.

### Soviet Union Gathers Fresh Troops; Switches from Defense to Offense in Various Areas; Fiercest Fighting in the Central Sector; German Forces Suffer Setbacks in Ostrov

Moscow, July 7 (United Press) – The official Soviet war communiqué has indicated that powerful Red Army forces have joined the war and that the Soviet side has begun to take the initiative, stating that Soviet forces have launched two counter-offensives and that German forces on all fronts have been stalled. The tone of this communiqué is very different from that of the previous few days, forcefully stating that Soviet forces are strongly resisting large German tank and motorized infantry divisions. The tone of the communiqué is quite forceful, stating that Soviet forces are no longer relying solely on defensive tactics or defensive counter-offensives but have dispatched unused reserves to attack the long-fighting and fatigued German forces.

Moscow, July 7 (United Press) – The Red Army Supreme Command has thrown a large number of fresh troops into the Stalin Line, 360 miles west of Moscow, to vigorously counterattack the German vanguard. Fiercest battles are taking place in the central sector, 500 miles long. The Soviet side claims that the German advance has been stopped.

Moscow, July 7 (Reuters) – A Soviet communiqué issued this morning claims that Soviet forces have achieved considerable success in counter-offensives in many areas of the long front line. It is reported that German forces in the Ostrov region on the Latvian border have been forced to adopt a defensive posture after suffering heavy setbacks in a Soviet counter-offensive. Also, in the Borisov region, where German forces are currently attempting to break through to Moscow, a major battle occurred yesterday after Soviet forces launched a counter-offensive against Nazi mechanized units. The German attempt to forcibly cross the Berezina River in the Bobruysk region is reported to have been repelled with heavy losses. Soviet forces are resisting the advance of German mechanized units in the Novograd-Volynsky and Volynsk regions.

Moscow, July 7 (TASS) – The Soviet Information Bureau issued the following recent battle report: "On the night of the 6th, fierce battles continued in the Ostrov, Polotsk, Borisov, and Novograd-Volynsky sectors, as well as on the Bessarabian front. Local battles and forward outpost activities took place in other sectors. The details are as follows: (1) Fierce battles raged throughout the night in the Ostrov sector. Fighting continues this morning. (2) In the Polotsk sector, our forces repelled enemy attacks and firmly defended the Dvina River line. Heavy fighting near the river resulted in tens of thousands of enemy corpses and destroyed enemy tanks and aircraft remaining on the battlefield. Most of the attacking enemy forces have been buried in the riverbed. (3) Heavy fighting took place on the night of the 5th in the Borisov sector. Our forces are conducting a counter-offensive, and the battle is continuing. (4) Enemy attacks in the Bobruysk sector have been repelled repeatedly, with the enemy suffering heavy losses. (5) In the Novograd-Volynsky sector, our forces are stopping the advance of large enemy mechanized units. (6) In the Bessarabian sector, a large number of German and Romanian cavalry and tanks attempted to advance in the Bălți sector, but they were forced to retreat due to the heroic resistance of our forces. (7) 61 enemy aircraft were shot down on July 4 (the previously reported 43 were inaccurate). We also lost 29 aircraft."

### Soviet Union Launches Collective Guerrilla Warfare in German-Occupied Territories

Moscow, July 7 (TASS) – In enemy-occupied territories, our people have spontaneously launched collective guerrilla warfare. Familiar with the terrain, they bravely attack the rear of the fascist aggressors. The German side is rushing to repair the destroyed bridges and, at the same time, must station troops at various points to protect the rear due to the activities of the guerrillas. Although German fascist censorship is extremely strict, the heroic exploits of the guerrillas are still being reported in foreign newspapers. A Berlin correspondent for the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported that guerrilla activity in the rear of the fascist forces has slowed down the German advance and caused panic among the German forces. German couriers and transport trucks are frequently attacked, forcing the German side to dispatch tanks and other units to protect them. Some Soviet citizens captured an officer from the German 33rd Infantry Regiment, who claimed that they were forced to fight against the Soviet Union. Also, German pilot Wilhelm Hanner, captured by the Red Army, admitted that the German Air Force has never encountered an enemy as strong as the Soviet Air Force.

London, July 7 (Reuters) – Moscow's Pravda stated today that the Soviet Union is facing great danger. At the same time, reports from all sides indicate that the German side is encountering greater difficulties than expected. According to a report from Sulek, German newspapers state that after the German forces invaded Soviet territory, their rear and flanks have repeatedly encountered unexpected resistance. An analysis in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung acknowledges that the strong resistance of Soviet forces has forced the German side to repeatedly dispatch fresh troops to assist in the fighting, a number larger than originally thought necessary. Other reports indicate that the German side is eager to know the number of Soviet reserves, knowing that they will clash with Soviet reserves when they reach the Stalin Line. The German side also cited weather difficulties. Their official news agency stated that Soviet forces set fire to the forests during their retreat. However, German forces continue to advance in several locations. Recent reports indicate that Soviet forces are currently under considerable pressure in certain sectors.

### Berlin Reports German Infantry Breaching the Stalin Line

Berlin, July 7 (United Press) – It is reported that powerful units of German infantry breached the "impregnable" Stalin Line yesterday and captured a heavily defended trench after 50,000 encircled Red Army soldiers surrendered. To date, 300,000 Red Army soldiers have been captured. Powerful German mechanized units are now reportedly 300 miles from Moscow and advancing in three directions: one targeting Leningrad, one targeting Moscow, and one targeting Kyiv. The German official news agency claims that the trenches captured by German forces "contained the latest artillery equipment." The vanguard of German infantry, who forcibly crossed the Dnieper River to attack the Soviet Union's strongest fortress, may have breached the Stalin Line near Orsha, following the Minsk-Moscow highway. Orsha is located between Minsk and Smolensk, but the Germans have not explicitly announced the point of breakthrough. The German official news agency acknowledges that large Soviet forces are still holding the northern forests. These Soviet forces are currently disrupting the German rear, frequently attacking Nazi rear communications and supply convoys. A reporter from the propaganda agency behind the Finnish front stated that the Leningrad-Murmansk railway has been cut by German air force at numerous points, preventing the Red Army from reinforcing Murmansk. It was also stated that the German Air Force has conducted extensive mine-laying operations in the Soviet Arctic Ocean, White Sea, and along the banks of the important White Sea-Baltic Canal.

### Soviet and German Navies Clash; Two German Destroyers Sunk

### China's Four Years of Struggle Have Laid the Foundation for Nation-Building; The Anti-Aggression Frontline Holds the Belief That Justice Will Prevail Over Might

The English-language "China Press" commented on China's four years of war yesterday in an article entitled "Four Years of War." The translation of the original article is as follows: "The Sino-Japanese War broke out four years ago today, and has now evolved from a local incident into a full-scale war, and has even triggered a world war. The ongoing European war is undoubtedly a consequence of the Asian war. The Japanese invasion of North China in 1937 set a precedent for the German destruction of peace in Europe two years later.

The Spirit of Resisting Aggression Connects the People of Europe and Asia. Resistance to aggression has had a spiritual connection from the beginning, but it is only today that it is recognized by the nations of the world who are determined to eliminate violence. Therefore, the entry of the Sino-Japanese War into its fifth year is worthy of the world's attention. The Sino-Japanese War has almost proven to us an unwavering belief: that no matter how superior a militaristic country's army is, no matter how vast the territory it has occupied, if the other side does not admit defeat, the aggressor cannot claim victory.

Britain's Understanding of China is a Model. No army can fight alone for a long time. If it wants to succeed, it must gain the support of the people. Today, all-powerful nations only whip their people, and cannot be said to have cooperation between the army and the people. It is only to be expected that they cannot fight for a long time. China has fought for four years, and has lost no less than thousands of square miles of land, and countless lives and property. However, it still holds the belief that 'justice will prevail over might' and has not diminished in the slightest. China has been able to build a nation during the war for the past few years, and it is based on this. Those in the world who want to have great fearlessness should take heroic China as a model, and then they can increase their courage and realize their hopes."

### President Pierce to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow; Delayed Ten Days Due to Hurricane Threat in Southeast Asia; To Leave Shanghai to Return to the United States to Await Deployment

The U.S. President Lines has been quiet for a long time since seven of its postal ships were requisitioned by the government and the schedules of various ships became secret. It is now known that the President Pierce postal ship, which has been requisitioned by the company, came to Shanghai from the United States in the middle of last month and went to Hong Kong and Luzon. It was originally scheduled to return from Luzon on the 4th of this month, passing through Hong Kong to Shanghai and returning to the United States, as reported in previous newspapers. Recently, due to a hurricane in Southeast Asia, the postal ship was affected and the schedule was repeatedly delayed. It is reported that the ship only sailed north from Hong Kong yesterday and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 9th) afternoon, stay overnight in Shanghai, and leave Shanghai the next day (the 10th), sailing directly to Honolulu and returning to San Francisco to report to the Shipping Commission and await deployment. As for the exact time of arrival and departure from Shanghai, the company is keeping it a secret and cannot announce it.

### Yesterday Marked the Fourth Anniversary of the Incident; All Sectors Were in High Spirits; Citizens Voluntarily Stopped Entertainment and Banquets; Some Unnecessary Roads Were Blocked

Yesterday marked the fourth anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident. All sectors of Shanghai observed a silent commemoration, voluntarily stopped entertainment and banquets, and observed a vegetarian diet for one day to mourn the soldiers and civilians who died in the war. All entertainment venues and radio stations, as usual, stopped entertainment programs to express their condolences. The citizens of the city, in order to show greater effort and vigilance, sincerely supported the established national policy and sent telegrams to the highest authorities and soldiers to pay their respects. Their emotions were exceptionally high.

Some Roads Were Blocked. In addition to the necessary precautions already taken, the Public Concession Police Department blocked all unnecessary roads along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch early yesterday morning at 5 a.m. Roads such as the Sanyangjing Bridge area, Gouqiao Bridge, Guangxi Road, Yunnan Road, Longmen Road, Chongqing Road, and Muirhead Road were all blocked. Other roads, such as the Bund, Henan Road, Zhengjia Wood Bridge, Dongxin Bridge, Yuqiaqing Road, Tongfu Road, Seymour Road, and Hardoon Road, were all barricaded with barbed wire, with large numbers of detectives stationed to guard and search. Although the French Concession did not block roads, it also dispatched more police officers for security.

The Nanshi Security Was Exceptionally Tight. Starting at 7 a.m. yesterday morning, all five iron gates connecting Nanshi to the Concession, such as Xiejiao Bridge, Nanyang Bridge, Xinjiao Street, Xinkai River, and the 16th Pier, were closed. They were not fully opened until 1 p.m., restoring traffic. Japanese soldiers were stationed at Xiejiao Bridge, Yimiao Temple, and Zhonghua Road. Two small tanks were also placed on Penglai Road. Zhaojiabang Road, from Ximen to Xiaodongmen Hengjie, was closed to traffic, blocking traffic in both directions. Public buses running around the city were also announced to be suspended. Telephone calls between the Chinese Concession were also interrupted for a short time. After the iron gates were opened in the afternoon, everything returned to normal. At around 6 p.m., all the iron gates were closed again.

### Recent Trade Between Shanghai and the United States is Exceptionally Prosperous; Stagnant Business in German Goods Shifts to Ordering from American Factories

Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German War, the source of German goods has become difficult. German pigments, Western medicines, hardware, machinery, etc. are generally being sold at inflated prices by those who hoard them, causing practical customers to dislike the high prices and switch to purchasing American goods. Recently, all lines of business for American merchants have been extremely prosperous. Due to the prosperity of their business, various import and export firms have been sending telegrams to American manufacturers to order various goods. Some British merchant firms have also switched to trading with the United States due to the difficulty of shipping British goods to Shanghai. The development of Shanghai's trade with the United States is unprecedented.

### Public Concession Raises the Price of Foreign Rice by Six Dollars Per Shi; Increased Costs and Increased Shipping Costs; Remaining Funds from Public Granary Continue to be Used for Purchases

The Public Concession recently issued a notice stating that due to the sharp increase in the cost of foreign rice at its origin and the increase in shipping costs, it has been forced to raise the selling price of foreign rice. The highest retail price will be changed to 116 yuan in national currency per shi (net weight 80 kilograms, or 160 market catties) starting from the 8th of this month.

First Batch of Granary Rice Sold to the Authorities

A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Management Committee of the Rice Trade Association yesterday that the first batch of 27,150 bags of the 80,000 bags of granary rice ordered by the association arrived at the port on the "Grant" ship on the 5th of this month and were unloaded and stored in the Roosevelt Warehouse. It is now known that the granary rice has been sold to the Public Concession for £2,240 per ton, at a price of HK$285.13, plus a handling fee of 1.5%, costing 102 yuan in national currency per shi (160 market catties). The Public Granary Committee and the Public Concession have agreed to pay for the goods and deliver them today. The Public Concession will distribute them to various rice shops for sale at a fair price.

Future Shipping Costs are Being Negotiated

The Public Granary Management Committee had previously reached an agreement with Norwegian firm Wah Loon & Co. that all granary rice would be carried by the "Grant" and "Delta" ships managed by the firm. The initial agreement was for a shipping fee of 95 shillings per ton (£2,240). Now, the shipowner is requesting an increase from 95 shillings to 160 shillings. The Public Granary Committee, considering the significant difference from the original figure, has requested permission to reduce it to 120 shillings per ton to reduce costs. The committee will send a letter to the owner of the "Grant" ship within the next few days, requesting compliance with the previously agreed contract or a reasonable reduction, otherwise it will have a significant impact on costs. The shipowner is not insisting on this point.

Public Granary to Continue Purchasing 30,000 Bags

At 2 p.m. yesterday, the eighth committee meeting was held, attended by He Dekui and others, as well as Vigneau, secretary of the French Concession Food Committee, to discuss (1) how to continue purchasing the second phase of granary rice. It was resolved that all of the committee's existing funds should be used to purchase as much as possible, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 bags of rice. However, since two members of the original rice purchasing committee have left Shanghai, Ye Fuxiao, Chen Ziyi, and Zhu Zixiang were appointed to handle the matter with full authority, and it is not necessary to be limited to Rangoon. If the price and transportation of Thai rice are more favorable, it may be purchased from Thailand instead. (2) Regarding the request to extend the contract period for the Daofu Foreign Firm to continue handling granary rice, it was resolved to approve it, and a letter will be sent immediately to request compliance.

Efforts to Mediate the Stevedore Strike

The stevedores in the soybean, rice, and miscellaneous grains industry in Shanghai went on strike on the 3rd of this month due to their unsuccessful demands from the employers to improve their treatment and increase their rice subsidies. According to a reporter from Da Guangshe, since the stevedores in the soybean and miscellaneous grains industry went on strike, more than 20,000 coolies on the docks, warehouses, and stacking yards, responsible for loading, unloading, shipping, barging, and stacking, have stopped working due to the lack of goods to load and unload. However, if the strike in this industry is not resolved soon, it will inevitably affect the livelihood of the above-mentioned workers and lead to unexpected incidents. Therefore, the Concession authorities are now actively seeking mediation.

Letter from the Stevedores

According to a letter from the stevedores, "The news reported yesterday about the strike of the stevedores in the soybean and miscellaneous grains industry, that the employers once asked the labor side to resume work immediately from today and then negotiate in good faith, but the labor side did not agree and is now negotiating day and night, is not entirely true. The stevedores in the soybean and miscellaneous grains industry all know that rice is the staple food of the people and are unwilling to go on strike lightly. Therefore, they first sent a letter to the Rice Trade Association and the Miscellaneous Grains Trade Association on June 19, proposing five measures to increase wages and improve treatment. After many days, there was no response. They sent another letter to the two associations on June 23, urging them to respond, but there was still no response. At that time, all the stevedores already had the motivation to go on strike, but after persuasion, it was temporarily calmed down.

Mediation Failed

Then, on June 29, the Political Department of the Public Concession summoned the labor side for questioning, and a responsible representative was sent to attend, bringing five demands for reference. On July 1, the Public Concession notified them again that mediation was scheduled for the morning of the 2nd, but the employer did not attend. It was changed to the afternoon of the same day for mediation, but the employer still did not attend. Since July 3, all the stevedores and helpers have jointly gone on strike in order to promote the employer's awareness. Unexpectedly, the employer reported to the police to arrest the stevedores, accusing them of obstructing freedom. At the same time, it was rumored that the employer believed that the stevedores' strike could stimulate rice prices to rise, and the longer the strike, the greater the profits for the rice shops. Since they have such intentions, there is no request for resuming work first. We are afraid of misunderstandings from the outside world, so we make this statement." According to reports, the Public Concession is currently deliberating on mediation methods. The labor side's demands are indeed too high, but the pressure of life is also a reality. It is understood that the responsible persons on both sides are carefully considering solutions to avoid affecting the people's food supply.

### Japanese Warships Concentrated Off Wenzhou, Approximately Dozens

The shrapnel injured two people. One, Chen Zhensheng (37 years old, local), suffered extremely serious injuries to his waist. The other person's name is unknown. An ambulance summoned by the police took Chen Zhensheng to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. The other man admitted himself to the hospital. It is reported that the grenade thrower escaped without a trace.

### Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce Participates in the National Foreign Trade Convention; The American Economy Has Entered a State of Preparation for War; Free Trade is Not Permitted by National Policy

The person in charge of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai stated to reporters yesterday that this year's National Foreign Trade Council will hold its annual meeting from October 6th to 8th at the Biltmore Hotel in New York. The Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce will continue to send representatives to attend as usual. It is reported that the items listed on the agenda of this meeting are very important. All issues related to current American foreign trade will be discussed. According to a notice issued by the association, "Since the European market, which accounts for one-third of our country's export trade, has been cut off, our country's trade in important products with the British Empire has been greatly reduced. Therefore, it will be even more difficult for us to maintain this trade in the future than during the First World War. The current stage of the European war has changed the basic position we occupy under the neutrality law. The United States is now fully mobilized to assist Britain and its allies. Because the defense plans of the United States and the Western Hemisphere have transformed our national economy into a state of preparation for war. At this critical moment, our trade with the remaining few markets has also been restricted due to national defense plans. Given these objective circumstances, the agenda of this year's annual meeting must focus on the mutual exchange of opinions, and then foreign trade experts and investors will discuss various wartime trade issues and formulate plans to make recommendations to the government to abandon some unnecessary foreign trade controls. The outcome of this war is very important to us. If they oppose our trade in the future, we cannot make any compromises with other nations in this environment, because their religious, economic, political, and social ideologies are all contrary to our free nation."

### German and Italian Residents in the Dutch East Indies Suddenly Ordered to Evacuate; A Group of 670 People Have Left the Country and Are Coming to Shanghai on the Asama Maru to Transfer to Japan; Rumors Abound that Many Japanese Ships Have Suspended Service on the Pacific Route

Negotiations between the Dutch East Indies and Japan in Batavia have now stalled. The chief representative, Yoshizawa, has also quietly left and returned to his country via Taipei yesterday. A group of German and Italian women and children, totaling 670 people, suddenly evacuated from the Dutch territory, and the situation has suddenly become tense. This matter is now attracting close attention from diplomatic circles in Britain and the United States. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German War, Japan has not yet announced its attitude towards the war. It is still observing whether it will stay out of the matter or fulfill its obligations.

Asama Maru Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai on Wednesday

A group of 670 German and Italian residents in the Dutch East Indies, including 70 German women and children, suddenly received orders from their respective governments to evacuate last Friday. All travel expenses were also subsidized by the German and Italian governments. They have already embarked on their journey to Shanghai on the Japanese postal ship Asama Maru (displacement of 10,017 tons, originally operating on the Pacific route). It is understood that the ship is expected to arrive here this Wednesday, and after staying in Shanghai, it will sail to Kobe. The German and Italian women and children will remain on the original ship to Japan, except for those who have relatives and friends in Shanghai. The reason why Germany and Italy are evacuating their residents in the Dutch East Indies may be a sign that the quiet South Pacific will be stirred up by storms.

The Ship's Route Changed Temporarily

According to news released by the Japanese postal ship company, the Asama Maru was originally scheduled to sail from Singapore Manila to Shanghai last Friday, but suddenly changed its plan temporarily and sailed directly from Manila to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies to load 670 residents designated by the German and Italian governments for evacuation to Shanghai. The ship may then dock in its own country and decide to cancel the Manila route, temporarily not accepting passengers and cargo, and the original route will be maintained by the Tatsuta Maru. There are rumors that the Sanukawa Maru and others will also suspend service on the Pacific route.

Australia and the Dutch East Indies Complete Joint Defense

The implementation of joint defense between Australia, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies was announced just three days ago. British Commander-in-Chief in Burma, Lieutenant General MacLeod, broadcast on the evening of the 5th, praising that the aviation bases in Burma and other parts of the Far East are well-equipped and sufficient to resist aggression. Military equipment in Burma, such as modern mechanized tanks, has also been continuously transported in. The tasks in this overall imperial defense plan are being completed one by one. General MacLeod's speech is quite subtle in light of rumors that Japan will launch a southward advance.

The Dutch East Indies is Fully Prepared Militarily

The Dutch East Indies occupies an important page in the current Far East situation and has a pivotal role. If it bows its head to the aggressor, its excellent mineral resources will be seized, which will affect the supplies of civilized countries. However, Lehman, the head of the Dutch East Indies Intelligence Service, and Poden, the Chief of General Staff, have successively expressed their determination to resist. "The people of the Dutch East Indies will fight for the truth, and any sacrifice will not be counted. The signal of freedom will be aroused by a tragic horn. Naval, land, and air force personnel are being mobilized and are intensifying training day and night to complete the arduous task of defense. The Dutch East Indies defense is fully prepared, and if the storm of foreign aggression continues, scorched earth tactics will not be spared."

### 100,000 Readers of the Sino-American Daily Console Churchill; A Signed Scroll Over 30 Zhang Long Was Presented to the British Authorities in Shanghai Yesterday

The Sino-American Daily in this city received a letter from readers Su Gengshi and two others in February of this year, initiating a joint consolation to Britain. The newspaper believed that this move was of profound significance and belonged to national diplomacy, so it should be promoted. It drafted a telegram and, together with the original letter from Su and others, published it in the newspaper on February 25, and stipulated the signing method.

### New Pu Yu Tang Continues to Hope for Donations; Still Short More Than 60,000 Yuan This Year

The Nanshi New Pu Yu Tang, which is run by the Catholic Charity Association as a welfare institution for poor children, has achieved remarkable results. Since this newspaper introduced it to readers, it has received enthusiastic support from all walks of life, with large donations or gifts of goods, giving a ray of hope to the precarious economic situation of the church and turning it from a situation of insecurity to stability.

An Anonymous Philanthropist

One day, when the sun was scorching hot and unbearably stuffy, a gentleman came to the hall in a hurry, stating his intention to donate 1,250 yuan to the New Pu Yu Tang. When asked for his name, he smiled and did not answer, but said that doing good is not for reward, so please write "anonymous". At that time, he was asked to pay the donation at the nearby Huamei Pharmacy collection point. Such a warm-hearted person who does good anonymously is truly commendable.

What the Orphanage Needs

The New Pu Yu Tang almost came to a standstill due to lack of funds. Now, it has finally overcome the difficulties, but it has not reached a point of complete and permanent relief. Therefore, donations are still urgent. In addition to donations, goods are also very necessary, such as rice, oil, salt, cloth, medicine, etc. Readers, if you give your surplus to the needy orphans, this must be something you are willing to do.

Children Care for Children

Among the many donors, there are also many donations from children, such as several students from the Sino-French School, several children from the Louis Elementary School, etc. They saved the candy money their parents gave them and donated it to the poor orphans. This is truly a manifestation of a pure childlike heart. Although the donations are small, their enthusiasm is extremely commendable. I hope that the children will unite and save some unnecessary consumption and donate it to the orphans as a righteous act of children caring for children.

Donation Collection Locations

Donation collection locations: (1) Trust Department of the Silk Industry Bank, 460 Sanma Road, (2) Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, Sassoon House on the Bund, (3) Jihua Tang Pharmacy, 47 Yunnan Road, (4) Huamei Pharmacy, 156 Sima Road, (5) Donation collection and donation collection location, Catholic Church on Catholic Church Street, French Concession (Please check today's newspaper cover for the New Pu Yu Tang's acknowledgement advertisement for donations received in May and June)

### Joyous Come Apartment Shooting Case: Witness Complaint Details, Wang Zhending Opens Fire, Wounds Hu Songyue, Both Hospitalized, Further Investigation After Recovery

On the 5th of this month, at 5:10 PM, a shooting incident occurred in Room 293 of the Joyous Come Apartment in the Run Come New Village on Jing'an Temple Road. Hu Songyue and Wang Zhending were injured at the time and taken to Shilong Hospital for treatment. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the case was heard by Judge Shi of the Special First Court in the Second Criminal Tribunal. The victim was Hu Songyue, and the defendant was Wang Zhending. Since both parties were injured and receiving treatment in the hospital, they were unable to attend court. The details of the hearing are recorded below:

Both Suffer Gunshot Wounds According to the Detective Attorney Zhang Tianyin, the victim, Hu Songyue, is 26 years old, from Wuxi, and runs the Haochang Iron Factory at 579 Wuding Road. He suffered injuries to his chest and both arms. The defendant, Wang Zhending, is 37 years old, from Zhejiang, and resides at 49 Shou'an Lane on Mintini Yin Road in the French Concession. He previously held a position in a certain organization. He is currently receiving treatment for a gunshot wound to his right leg at Baolong Hospital and was unable to attend court today.

Loan Dispute It was found that Hu and Wang were acquainted, and both possessed licensed firearms donated to the Public Works Department. In March of this year, Wang borrowed 2,115 yuan from Hu. Afterwards, Wang gave Hu a check from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank for 600 yuan, payable on June 10th, which Hu transferred to his friend Yao Wenjie. When the check matured, Yao presented it to the bank, but it was returned due to insufficient funds. Yao then hired attorney Chen Qingfeng to send a letter to Wang Zhending, demanding that the check be cleared by July 8th.

Angered into a Rage After receiving the letter, Wang was deeply dissatisfied and went to Room 393 of the Joyous Come Apartment in the Run Come New Village on Jing'an Temple Road on the afternoon of the 5th of this month to negotiate with Hu Songyue. He took out a pistol and accused Hu of inappropriate behavior. Hu immediately stated that it was Yao's personal action and that he was unaware of it. At that time, the defendant put the gun down, but unexpectedly, the gun suddenly went off, hitting his own right leg. However, the defendant, not knowing it was an accidental discharge, mistakenly believed that Hu had opened fire, and in a fit of rage, raised his gun again and fired two shots at Hu, one hitting Hu's chest and the other hitting his arm. Hu fell to the ground, injured.

Investigating the Bullets The defendant, believing that Hu also had a handgun, then went forward and took Hu's handgun, firing a shot into the sky outside the window. Afterwards, he sat in the room until the police heard the alarm and sent detectives to arrest the defendant. Two handguns were seized on the table. Hu's handgun contained six bullets, and the defendant's handgun contained five bullets. It appeared that a total of three bullets had been fired, so it is still necessary to investigate exactly how many shots were fired. A request was made for a postponement, and the witnesses Yang Kesen, Gu Haicheng, and Yao Wenjie all filed complaints. The court ordered the case to be postponed until the defendant recovers from his injuries for further review.

### Grain: Public Works Department Rice Continues to Arrive, Rice Prices Rise Across the Board by About Two Yuan

Yesterday, foreign rice saw another price increase. Although some hoarders released stock at noon and a new transaction was about to be agreed upon, resulting in a slight drop, the closing price was still about two yuan higher than on Saturday. At the opening of the market this morning, due to the continuous shrinkage of exchange rates and the gradual increase in production costs, people were already optimistic. Furthermore, unpredictable international changes encouraged speculators to buy, coupled with the fact that orders had not been completed for the past two weeks, providing further justification for hoarders to raise prices. Therefore, prices gradually increased after opening. Yinghua Company's Xiaojiao rice reached 154 yuan, No. 2 Siamese rice for July arrival reached 147 yuan, Sui rice futures 118 yuan, spot 115 yuan, all up about three yuan. Subsequently, a new transaction was initially negotiated by Dahu but not finalized, and later agreed upon by Shenji Foreign Company, involving a ship of Xiaojiao rice to be shipped at the end of July, priced at 151 or 156 yuan in Shanghai currency, pending confirmation today. Once the transaction was confirmed, market sentiment calmed down, and the price dropped by one or two yuan as profit-taking long positions were released and hoarders observed. As a result, the closing price was still one or two yuan higher than last weekend. Total transactions for spot rice were over 30,000 bags, and Yinghua Company's transactions were over 220 tons. However, the majority was bought by hoarders, with actual sales to local customers accounting for only 20-30%.

Public Works Department foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou ship arrived at the port at noon the day before yesterday (Sunday), carrying 10,000 bags of Public Works Department's low-priced foreign rice shipped from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday, also carrying 15,106 bags of foreign rice shipped from Hong Kong, also Public Works Department rice, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. It is heard that a large shipment of Siamese rice is expected to arrive in Shanghai within the next few days. (Zu)

For thick and thin Japonica domestic rice, the supply of fresh Nangang early and late rice is still scarce, and local shops favor it, leading to strong sales and frequent shortages. Prices continue to rise by about two yuan. The quality of the rice is relatively muddy, with high-quality rice priced at 143-144 yuan and medium-quality rice at 141-140 yuan. As for Wuxi original-packaged overnight Japonica rice, although the supply is also limited, sales are weaker, making it difficult to compete with early rice, resulting in a slight price increase of one yuan. High-quality rice is priced from 132-133 yuan to 129 yuan.

The market for glutinous rice is also scarce. In addition, prices of other grains are rising across the board, boosting market sentiment. Both retail and wholesale markets are quite active. Prices of both domestic and foreign glutinous rice have increased by about one yuan. Hong Kong high-grade white glutinous rice is priced at 144-145 yuan, ordinary grade at 142-143 yuan, medium-grade at 141 yuan. High-grade glutinous lvs is priced from 115 yuan to 109 yuan.

### Sugarcane and Sugar (2) - Foreign Section -

— Gao Jiannong

This shows that he fundamentally did not understand the method of sugarcane sugar production: because although there is a kind of white powder growing on the stems and leaves of sugarcane, it is definitely not the raw material for making sugar. In 98 AD, the Roman natural scientist Pliny the Younger also recorded that during the reign of the notorious tyrant Nero, doctors used the name "Indian salt" to refer to cane sugar: this substance "resembles ordinary table salt in shape and color, but has the taste of honey." If this record truly came from the hand of Pliny the Younger and was not a forgery, then the production and popularity of "white salt sugar" already existed in the first century AD! Unfortunately, no definite corroborating evidence can be found for this, and most scholars are unwilling to believe it, thinking that this statement is a bit premature.

To say that cane sugar truly spread to the eastern Mediterranean and that Europeans gained a clear and accurate concept of it, can only be traced back to 627 AD when Emperor Heraclius of the Eastern Roman Empire first launched his eastern expedition against Persia: at that time, the cane sugar seized as war booty was regarded as part of the Persian king's treasury. How did the Persians learn to make cane sugar? Probably before 500 AD, they had already planted sugarcane near the city of Gondisapur at the mouth of the Euphrates River. There was a Catholic monastery in this area, and the monks were deeply knowledgeable in medicine and had frequent interactions with Indian doctors. They learned the secret of sugar-making from Indian doctors and refined and improved it, thus first creating truly pure white and solid cane sugar, which they named "Tabergad," meaning "that which is split with an axe." This is the true origin of "white granulated sugar" and "rock sugar." Moreover, what we now call "rock sugar" is called Kand in Persian, which is very similar to the royal title Kani or Khan, what is called "Khan" in our historical records. I presumptuously speculate that only the king could initially enjoy it, so it got the name Kand.

The practice of cultivating sugarcane spread extremely rapidly in Persia, so by the mid-seventh century AD, when the powerful Arabs rose from the desert and conquered the region, the rapid sugar production industry was already flourishing. The Arabs immediately imposed taxes on sugarcane fields and sugar factories; sometimes, these taxes were collected in kind, that is, in the form of manufactured sugar, to be used for the royal palace's daily consumption or celebrations. The Arabs also widely spread sugarcane to all the places their forces reached, first affecting Egypt: probably around 750 AD, the fertile and rich Nile Delta was covered with sugarcane fields. Sugar-making technology also made significant progress, because for many centuries, many scholars had been immersed in chemical research there: for example, the method of using lime or plant ash to purify sugarcane juice began at this time; some also believe that the manufacture of rock sugar also originated in Egypt. The consumption of cane sugar increased even more dramatically. According to a book by Lippemann: "The amount of sugar consumed for a royal wedding or other celebration could reach as high as 61,000 kilograms or even 76,000 kilograms in today's quantities"! Sugarcane also spread with the Arabs' invincible military power, multiplying in Morocco in 710 AD, and from there, it crossed the sea to settle in Spain, and it immediately flourished due to the suitable climate and soil in these places. Several Arabic books that appeared at this time described the planting of sugarcane and sugar-making methods in great detail and accurately; moreover, stone mills used to crush sugarcane at that time still remain in the three cities of Valencia, Alicante, and Malaga along the Mediterranean coast of Spain. The Arabs also introduced sugarcane to areas in the eastern Mediterranean such as Palestine, Syria, Sicily, and Cyprus in the mid-eighth century. The above-mentioned places were famous sugar-producing centers in the Middle Ages, especially the sugar produced in Egypt, which was of superior and solid quality and could last for a long time, so it occupied an extremely important position in commodities.

### Academic Lectures: The Method of Historical Research (3)

— Xue Wujing

(1) The Application of Tools History is rooted in geography, just as the soul is attached to the body. Without a body, there is no soul; without geography, how can there be history? The so-called tools refer to geography and maps. The scope of geography is extremely broad, including terrain, oceans, mountains, rivers, soil, minerals, and climate. The great stage of human activity is, of course, on the earth, and no one is unaffected and restricted by geography. For example, China is located in the temperate zone, so it is one of the world's cradles of civilization. The development of culture originated in rivers. The activities of the early people were in the Yellow River basin, gradually moving south, expanding to the Yangtze River basin, and then advancing to the Xijiang River basin, the Heilongjiang River basin, bounded by the sea in the southeast, blocked by high mountains in the northwest, separated by deserts in the north, and bordered by the tropics in the south. Thus, this vast country, occupying one-fifth of the world's population and one-fourteenth of its territory, although naturally blessed, has natural limitations in its development on all sides. Furthermore, plains are suitable for agriculture, and the people of the south lack a strong spirit; plateaus are suitable for nomadic life, and the people of the north have a more magnificent style. Therefore, when it comes to culture, the south is higher than the north; when it comes to military achievements, the north is stronger than the south. The partial peace of the Eastern Jin Dynasty and the southward crossing of Gaozong, the impermanence of unity and the occasional division and combination, none of these were unaffected by the limitations of the north and south of the region. By the time maritime transport flourished and science progressed, distances of thousands of miles were shortened, and there was a method for shrinking the land. Therefore, this old ancient country, even if it wanted to close itself off from the world and never interact with people, could not do so. Other climates, the quality of the soil, and the distribution of production are all closely related to the masters of history. Therefore, those who read ancient history should at least skim through Gu Zuyu's Reading History Fangyu Jiyao, Gu Tinglin's Tianxia Junguo Libi Book, as well as the Records of Rivers and Canals, the Water Classic Commentary, the Geographical Explanation, and the Geographical Rhyme Bias, etc., so as not to have the disease of swallowing dates whole and having a vague impact on the historical background. What is decided by geography is nothing more than a map. If the map is unclear, then the division and combination of the territory, the changes in hills and valleys, the division of political regions, and the strategic importance of passes in various dynasties will inevitably cause dizziness and confusion. If many historical materials are piled up in the chest and the causes and consequences cannot be clarified, what is the benefit? The earliest map-making in China can be attributed to Pei Xiu of the Jin Dynasty, who made the Yu Gong Regional Map. Jia Dan of the Tang Dynasty made the Hai Nei Huayi Map, using one inch to represent one hundred miles, which was the beginning of drawing maps with a scale. The Ancient and Modern Counties and Roads of the Four Barbarians described the ancient counties in ink and the current prefectures and counties in red, which was also the beginning of the distinction between red and black in later illustrated books. Later, in the early Qing Dynasty, Westerners Du Dewei and others were ordered to survey and map the maps of various provinces and vassal states, naming it the Huangyu Quanlan Map, which was the beginning of China having actual measured maps. Yang Shoujing's Historical Territorial Evolution Map of Dynasties, written during the Qianlong period, presents the history of past and present in a way that shows its evolution. It is a great undertaking in our academic circles. In recent times, Su Jiarong has also created the Chinese Geographical Evolution Map, examining the similarities and differences and analyzing subtle points, which is unmatched by the works of recent scholars and can serve as a ladder for scholars of history. These are all essential readings for our historical research.

### Entertainment Mania

— Xiao Yun

Reading the statistics of the money Shanghai people spend on luxury goods and entertainment venues every month, the huge numbers are always staggering. Luxury obsession and entertainment mania can be said to be a special phenomenon in Shanghai after the war.

However, when we examine the situation in European and American countries during the First World War, the situation was almost no exception. After the European War, people of all ages in Europe and the United States mostly became entertainment maniacs in their spare time because they were oppressed by the war in terms of their emotions. Dance halls, casinos, and taverns, all places of entertainment, were three times as profitable. Social morality declined. Probably what is called "people's hearts are not as ancient as before, and social customs are declining" is exactly this time.

According to psychologists, this large-scale phenomenon of seeking pleasure is not accidental. After humans are spiritually oppressed, they will naturally find an emotional outlet for themselves. People with deeper cultivation will feel the importance of their own responsibilities because of the occurrence of war, and therefore stand more firmly in their positions. Their response to war is constructive. As for people with shallow cultivation, their response is naive and escapist. In order to temporarily forget the spiritual oppression they have suffered, they embark on the path of excessive indulgence in seeking pleasure.

We do not deny the benefits and needs of appropriate and noble entertainment, but what we are willing to point out here in particular is: entertainment is a shallow and escapist reaction to war in humans. To eliminate this naive phenomenon, personal cultivation is an important key.

### Roosevelt's Floating Palace

— Hua Zhi

In this time of widespread war and precarious world situation, President Roosevelt's only pastime outside of official duties is to take a trip on the yacht "Potomac," temporarily forgetting the disputes of the world and enjoying a moment of quiet pleasure.

President Roosevelt originally had two places for rest, Warm Springs and Hyde Park, but there, he was constantly disturbed by telephone calls, not as leisurely and free as on the water. In his childhood, the president liked to sail and boat, and he has not given up this old hobby even after becoming president. Every summer and autumn, he would always take a boat trip, fishing and looking for fun along the way.

Each time the president travels, he often brings a group of advisors and close friends. The recent cruises along the coast of Florida were like this. However, the friends he brought each time were different. Each trip lasted from one to three days, traveling down the Potomac River into Chesapeake Bay, with the aim of fishing, resting, and enjoying the coolness. The topics of conversation were half official and half social. Amidst the leisure, a little official business was handled. The president likes to strategize outside the office, and he often finalizes major plans during his travels.

The "Potomac" is the president's floating palace, converted from a coast guard cutter. The ship was originally named "Electra," and it was renamed after Roosevelt took office in March 1936. The entire ship is painted gray, and its appearance is not very luxurious, but the president loves it very much. The boat is 165 feet long, less than 24 feet wide, and has a displacement of 450 tons. It is powered by a diesel engine and has a speed of 14 miles per hour.

The arrangement of the rear part of the middle deck of the yacht is the most unique. It is covered with a large pile of thick cushions, with several tables and armchairs. This area is called the "fantail" in naval terminology, and it is suitable for dining, playing games, reading, and resting. The president spends most of his time on the water here.

In front of the fantail are the dining room and the president's bedroom. The interiors of both rooms are very simple. The bedroom only has a bed, a table, and a few chairs. The middle of the deck is the living quarters for the officers and soldiers on the boat, as well as the president's kitchen. The front is the captain's private room.

On the top deck, there are three open-air areas for deep-sea fishing and sunbathing. From the middle floor to the top floor, there are handrails and an artificial elevator installed in the large chimney at the stern. On the top deck, there are often a 18-foot-long whaling boat and a 26-foot-long motorized whaling boat. These boats are sometimes lowered into the water for fishing.

On the bottom deck, directly below the dining room and the president's bedroom, there are two bedrooms and two small rooms for five or six of the president's guests to rest. The front of the deck is the engine room and the sailors' bedroom. Generally speaking, the equipment of this yacht is similar to that of other yachts. However, the "Potomac" is equipped with two .50-caliber anti-aircraft machine guns, as well as equipment to defend against magnetic mines. There are fifty sailors on board.

When Roosevelt travels by boat, the Navy Department sends at least one destroyer to escort him. The official business he handles in his floating palace is no different from that in the White House in Washington. Government departments such as the State Department and the White House transmit important news to the president.

This news is first telegraphed to the Naval Radio Station, which then relays it to the yacht. The yacht also uses this method to relay messages to Washington. If Washington has important documents and mail that need to be reviewed or signed by the president, the Navy sends an airplane to the president's cruising location.

The president's floating palace is not only a place for handling state affairs, but also has historical value. In the days of the old President Roosevelt, the Russo-Japanese Portsmouth Peace Conference was in a state of impasse. Old Roosevelt invited representatives from both Japan and Russia to his yacht "Mayflower" to persuade them to understand each other, and succeeded. As for the "Potomac," although its history is short, it has already created a lot of history. Before the outbreak of the European War, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England visited the United States and traveled on the yacht from Washington to Mount Vernon. In addition, the president has held talks with dignitaries from various countries on the yacht.

Therefore, whenever international tensions are high, we hear that the President of the United States is boating and fishing, and we feel that he is too leisurely, but we do not know that the president does not forget state affairs while fishing!

Inventions

### New Glass

— Jie Quan

The invention of glass is undoubtedly a major contribution to modern civilization, but usually glass is only used to make windows and utensils, and has few other uses. The reason is that glass is easily broken, not easily bent, and not as convenient and durable as wooden objects.

However, in recent years, the glass industry has obviously made great progress, and various novel glasses have been invented and successfully made. Many of the cloth or wooden items that were previously available have been replaced by glass.

There is currently a kind of fabric on the market that is bright and dazzling, as shiny as silk, fire-resistant, and water-resistant. This strange fabric is woven from thin, flexible glass fibers. Since the United States began mass production of this glass fiber in 1939, countries have competed to imitate it. It is expected that in the near future, the textile industry in various countries around the world will undergo major innovations.

Everyone knows that safety glass is made of two layers of ordinary glass, with a layer of transparent plastic sandwiched in between. This transparent plastic can hold the inner and outer layers of glass together, preventing them from shattering. During the European war, stores in cities around the world used this principle to manufacture unbreakable glass, so as to reduce damage to doors and windows during air raids. The method of making it is to sandwich a layer of fine lead wire mesh or transparent fiber sheet in the glass. Another method is to stick a sparse, leaky curtain on ordinary glass, and then glue the curtain firmly to the glass with paint or glue. In this way, even if the glass windows are inevitably shattered by the shock of an air raid, they will not scatter and injure nearby people.

Elastic glass is another extremely important chemical invention. This glass has all the advantages of ordinary glass, but without its disadvantages. Elastic glass is transparent and bright, can be bent, and no liquid can penetrate it. It is odorless, tasteless, and not easily worn or broken. It can also be made into various beautiful colored glasses, and some people are already using it to make belts, suspenders, carrying cases, handbags, and other things. And because gold letters and inks can also be hot-stamped on this kind of glass, it can also be used to bind books.

10. A Father's Heart

"But who will plant these few acres of land?" Zhang Xiaogouzi's answer was very straightforward.

So, Begonia had to give up the plan to move. It didn't matter if the land was not planted, or even if it was abandoned, but where would the food for the family of three come from? Buy it with money? There were too many places to spend money, and the money he had was too little!

He leaned his body against a wooden pillar under the porch, his face facing the sky, and unconsciously became lost in thought.

Later, the bell for the end of class woke him up.

"Dad, it's raining so hard, and you still have to come yourself. Look, your body is all wet!" Meibao opened her two slender arms, swooped over like a swallow skimming the water, hugged Begonia's waist, and said with a spoiled and coquettish look: "If it's like this again next time, I won't go back with you!"

Avoid the suffering of dampness and fever in summer

Begonia just smiled slightly and didn't say anything. He took her hand and hurriedly walked to the end of the corridor. He was always very afraid to meet Meibao's teachers and classmates. As long as he could avoid it, he would never want to meet them.

When he reached the end of the corridor, he squatted down, wanting to carry Meibao on his back.

"That's not good, Dad!" Meibao insisted on refusing.

Begonia stood up very awkwardly, turned his head, and looked at his daughter with an inquiring gaze. (152)

### Telescopes on Glasses

— Ke Zhong

To help certain visually impaired patients read books and newspapers, American eyewear manufacturers have recently invented a small telescope that can be mounted on ordinary glasses to help with reading. This is because there are some patients whose vision is too weak, even the most powerful magnifying glasses cannot enable them to read books and newspapers. This small telescope is exquisitely manufactured, and its structure is the same as the world's largest 100-inch telescope at the Wilson Mountain Observatory. This is truly good news for the visually impaired.

### Novel Election

— Xin Juan

Strange and interesting things happen endlessly in Hollywood. Recently, a group of American naval personnel held a novel and interesting problem test, soliciting answers. Their question was: "If you were stranded on a desert island, who would you want to be with?" As a result, Lana Turner received the most votes. Lana is the former wife of Artie Shaw, a bandleader famous for his clarinet, who is now divorced. She has married singer Tony Martin, the former husband of Alice Faye. After they collaborated on "Ziegfeld Girl," their love matured, and they recently announced at the Movieland building in Hollywood that their wedding date was set for September 10 of this year, to be held in Las Vegas.

Lana Turner is the "hot girl" idol most admired by college students. Under the nickname "Sweater Girl," she certainly has moving characteristics in terms of physical beauty. Her bold, bare-chested and bare-armed clothing is the most eye-catching in Hollywood, not only on the screen, but also in public places. Therefore, her seductive and bold style is even more captivating than "Oops Girl" Ann Sheridan.

The naval personnel who voted for her generally believed that if they were stranded on a desert island with her, they would not feel bored or disappointed even if they never returned to the civilized world.

### Ying Yin to Perform in a Stage Play

— Bu Min

Since Ying Yin returned to Shanghai, her works have rarely been seen by the audience. Perhaps this is due to prudence. Of course, "Sai Jinhua" and "Return of the Soul" have considerable achievements, so everyone's expectations for this artist are also particularly high.

It is rumored that "Children of the World," which has been rumored for a long time, will meet the audience in the cool autumn. This play stars Ying Yin and Sima Yingcai, and the story tells the love and success story of two orphans. Ying Yin plays an orphan who is fostered in a carpenter's house. She undergoes various hardships from a young age and is even forced to work as a dancer, but she is able to work hard and achieve success. The Minhua Company has specially invited the German couple Frelke to direct, which shows how serious they are.

In fact, before "Children of the World" is staged, Ying Yin can have an opportunity to show her true face to the audience, which is to perform "Grievances in the Qing Palace" at Tianfeng. "Grievances in the Qing Palace" is a quite great drama, and news about it has been seen in various newspapers. It is currently being rushed into production by Fei Mu, and it is said that the technique is extremely novel.

Ying Yin plays the role of Consort Zhen in "Grievances in the Qing Palace." Some people believe that "Grievances in the Qing Palace" should be based entirely on the historical facts of Empress Dowager Cixi, because according to folk legends, Cixi is considered even greater than Wu Zetian. In fact, according to accurate research, Cixi did not have many achievements worth mentioning. According to the political situation of the year, Emperor Guangxu and Consort Zhen were actually the main characters. Consort Zhen was a beautiful and wise woman who, with full of justice and passion, wanted to revitalize the country, but was eventually oppressed by evil forces and died by throwing herself into a well. Yao Ke wrote the play with Emperor Guangxu and Consort Zhen as the main characters, so Ying Yin took on the role.

It is reported that this play can be performed around the 17th, which is Ying Yin's first shot on stage after returning to Shanghai. It is expected that countless audiences are looking forward to it!

### Zhang Yipeng Rehearses the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom

— Wei Ren

"Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" is a great historical drama. In the past, Huayi Film Company filmed a film, and the "Hong Yijiao" performed by Zhonglu shortly afterwards also adopted a story from this. Recently, reporters learned that Gengxin Stage is also planning to rehearse this play.

Gengxin's performance of "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" has been brewing a strong atmosphere for a long time. It was previously rumored that Zhang Yipeng was going to write the script himself, and now we can reveal this mysterious curtain.

The content of the script is determined to adopt three outlines: (1) Zhang Yipeng himself drafted it. (2) Refer to the "Red Sheep Heroes" of the Gongwu Stage. (3) The materials collected by He Haisheng. — Combining these three points will become the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" that will be performed soon.

The plot of the first play starts with Lin Zexu being impeached and ends with the uprising in Jintian Village. The romance between Hong Yijiao and Xiao Chaogui is also interspersed in it. Zhang Yipeng plays Wei Changhui, Liu Wenkui plays Hong Xiuquan, and the work is very heavy. On the martial arts side, Liang Xichao, Wang Fuying, etc. will participate, and the opening scene of the Baoliang attacking bandits will be absolutely firm.

These days, Zhang Yipeng is sweating profusely, supervising all the staff and stepping up the rush to rehearse. It can be performed around this Sunday or next Sunday. They only perform on Sundays, and only during the day.

I really like the story of "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," and I hope that this performance can give us a sense of justice stimulation, rather than being boring and poor.

### Casual Talk on "Wusheng" on Various Stages in Shanghai (4)

— Jing Chun

Wang Xiaofang: Wang Xiaofang, a wusheng at the Grand Theater, is currently in his prime. He has been performing with Lin Shusen for many years and is a figure in Lin's bag. He is also good at many plays. His martial arts are strong and extraordinary. Although he is short in stature, his appearance is extremely dignified. He can play roles such as Zhou Yu and Lu Bu, which is still quite considerable. The plays with costumes such as "Changban Slope," "Jizhou City," and "Yuehu City" are his forte. He is also capable in short-hit plays, and his falls and tumbles all show skill. Therefore, stage owner Lin Shusen relies on him very much. However, recently he went to play Jia Ming in "Legend of the Gods and Swordsmen," and his jokes and laughter were very funny and commendable.

Zhao Songqiao: Speaking of Zhao Songqiao, he has been in the Liyuan circle for a long time. He has been hanging his sign at the Gongwu Stage for a long time. He is capable in both civil and military plays, and he is also one of the great mixers. He is very willing to work hard in the plays he performs. Every move and every action is full of energy, which is unmatched by other wusheng, so he has also won praise from the general audience. Since he went to the Tianchan Theater, Chen Hefeng's full notice was dismissed, and he took the lead alone; however, the box office appeal of the play "Huang Tianba" was slightly reduced, so he hired the Beijing-style actor Song Shiluo to perform on stage, ranking below Song. Regarding Zhao's wusheng plays, he is good at costumes. In the past, his performances were vivid and worth watching. Now, there is no purely orthodox wusheng play that can satisfy the audience. He specializes in winning with his performance style.

Chapter 12: What Can Ning Wu Do?

They attacked the city again in the afternoon, and Zhou Yuji taught them to fire the cannons again. For three consecutive days, they beat the rebel soldiers so hard that they cried out in pain. The total loss was 10,000 people. Li Zicheng said angrily: "Zhou Yuji is so hateful! If I don't break Ningwu, I swear I won't live!" Niu Jinxing suggested: "Although Zhou Yuji is brave and good at defending, if we attack continuously, and he has no external reinforcements, he will be broken by me sooner or later. It is better to divide our troops into ten teams and take turns attacking. When they fire the cannons, we will stop attacking. After the cannons stop, we will continue to attack, so that there is no time for the city to breathe, and we can take advantage of the opportunity to attack." Li Zicheng praised Niu Jinxing's suggestion, so he divided his troops into ten teams. Infantry and cavalry were combined, with about a thousand people in each team, building various colored flags to identify them, and attacking day and night. Unfortunately, the cannons on the pass were unharmed, but the gunpowder was exhausted, and they could only be fired sparingly. Seeing that the sound of the cannons on the city was sparse, the rebels boldly crowded up. Zhou Yuji then gathered archers and crossbowmen to shoot. One team of rebel soldiers came and one team went, taking turns attacking. The first team used a red flag, led by the rebel general One Tiger, and attacked the most fiercely. The second team used a green flag, led by the rebel general Full Sky Star, with the most bows and arrows. They specialized in shooting rockets. The third team used a yellow flag, led by the rebel general Zai Jinhu, with the most siege ladders. The fourth team used a black flag, mostly cavalry, led by the rebel general Shoot Down the Sky. The remaining fifth team used a purple flag, the sixth team used white, the seventh team used blue, the eighth team used light red, the ninth team used ochre, and the tenth team used gray. They were colorful, dazzling and strange, making the officers and soldiers on the pass overwhelmed. For another five days in a row, the officers and soldiers were indeed exhausted. Niu Jinxing also taught the rebel soldiers to tie persuasive letters to the arrows and shoot them to the city wall. The officers and soldiers picked them up and gave them to Zhou Yuji to read. Zhou Yuji was afraid that the morale of the soldiers would be shaken, so he summoned the generals and persuaded them: "We killed 10,000 rebels in the first three days. Although we lack ammunition now, we can still fight for a long time. If we can win, the entire army will be loyal and righteous, otherwise, it is better to tie me up and offer me to the rebels." All the generals wept and obeyed, vowing to defend the city to the death. (109)
