### Kurusu Saburo Arrives in Washington; Scheduled to Meet with U.S. President Today; Acknowledges Difficulties but Aims to Complete Mission; Denies Carrying Any Personal Letters

Reuters, Washington, 16th: Japanese Special Envoy Kurusu arrived in Washington yesterday. Japanese Ambassador Nomura and U.S. State Department officials welcomed him at the airport. Kurusu stated that he was aware of the difficulty of his mission, but he felt there was still a chance to strive for its success. When Kurusu received reporters in New York, he said that there were few irreconcilable disputes between the U.S. and Japan. When asked about his views on the prospects for peace, Kurusu smiled cautiously and slowly, saying, "In the current situation, one person's efforts are too small; we must all support it." Local newspapers yesterday did not criticize Kurusu's arrival, but Kurusu will undoubtedly be uneasy about the headline reporting the withdrawal of U.S. sailors stationed in China and President Roosevelt's speech on Friday, as this speech is generally seen as frankly stating that the Far East situation contains dangerous elements that could lead to war. Kurusu's current remarks, such as expressing hope that he can obtain opportunities in Washington to make his mission a success, are vague. If Kurusu hopes to succeed in Washington, like a soccer player kicking the ball straight into the goal, then Kurusu will find the field extremely difficult to navigate. Well-informed sources felt that his mission would fail as soon as Kurusu arrived. Although the United States does not want a war in the Pacific, it will never violate its declared policies. All qualified observers have not seen the possibility that Kurusu will make major concessions that the United States can accept, while the United States still insists on conditions that these people believe are difficult for the Japanese military to agree to. Judging from the situation, possible concessions do not seem to bring the two sides closer. According to recent news from the East, Kurusu's mission is solely to observe whether the United States is bluffing or speaking truthfully. If the United States shows any signs of weakness, Kurusu can return home and give the green light to the Tojo cabinet to carry out its aggressive policies. But if the United States remains strong, Japan will neither advance north nor south, but only maintain its current position. If this is true, then Japan will definitely maintain its current position, because Kurusu will not only see the United States insist on its policies, but will now see the United States fully prepared to intensify its necessary economic pressure if Japan takes action.

United Press, Washington, 16th: Japanese Special Envoy Saburo Kurusu is preparing to have high-profile talks with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull tomorrow, which will determine the key to peace or war. Reliable sources say they believe Kurusu has new information regarding existing disputes between the two countries, but he has remained silent here and in New York. Before boarding a military plane to Washington from New York at 12:05 last night, he refused to answer questions from fifty reporters. Kurusu said he did not carry any personal letters to President Roosevelt. He said, "There are few completely irreconcilable situations in diplomatic history." Reliable sources in Washington yesterday described the U.S. policy and progress on various points in the recent negotiations: The United States and Japan fully agree to maintain peace in the Pacific. Regarding the issue of ceasing aggression, Japan has not yet provided satisfactory assurances to the United States. The United States has requested that the use of force be stopped in the implementation of national policy, and that interference in the internal affairs of other countries be stopped. Japan refused to agree to this, insisting that the situation in the Far East has special characteristics and requires special treatment. Washington has tried to adjust international issues in a peaceful way. Japan agreed to this in principle, but insisted that the situation in the Far East should be given practical consideration.

United Press, Washington, 16th: Well-informed sources predict that Japan will not take new offensives, but will continue to wage a war of nerves against Britain and the United States to await the results of the U.S.-Japan talks. If it fails, Japan will prepare for rapid action. Kurusu and Japanese Ambassador Nomura have had initial talks, preparing for important talks with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull tomorrow. Peace or war in the Far East will depend on these talks.

### Japan Says Kurusu's U.S. Visit Is a Last Effort

United Press, Tokyo, 16th: Well-informed Japanese sources said today that Saburo Kurusu's U.S. visit represents the Japanese government's last effort to break the Pacific crisis. Developments in Washington in the next few days will be extremely important. It also stated that if the United States is truly willing to maintain peace in the Pacific, it should recognize Japan's strong determination to overcome any obstacles to complete its established policies. These sources pointed out that the special parliament, which officially opened this morning, is particularly important for uniting the 100 million people of the Japanese Empire to cope with any contingencies. The Hochi Shimbun predicted that Kurusu will frankly convey the facts to President Roosevelt and Hull, saying that Japan's patience has reached its limit at a time when the anti-Japanese encirclement of the U.S., Britain, China, and the Netherlands is intensifying. The newspaper said that the fate of the Pacific depends on the attitude of American leaders. The Nichinichi Shimbun said that Kurusu's mission is regarded as the last effort for peace in the Pacific. If the United States insists on its original attitude, then our country's peace enthusiasm, hope, and efforts cannot be optimistic. It also stated that Japan's basic policy of resolving the Sino-Japanese War and building a co-prosperity sphere remains unchanged. The Yomiuri Shimbun said that the Japanese government and people have resolved to protect their country in the crisis and are willing to make any sacrifices, and declared that before the parliament is held, "the fate of the Pacific is at stake."

United Press, New York, 16th: Scripps-Howard newspapers published an editorial in its newspapers yesterday, stating that if Britain and Japan accept President Roosevelt's "Atlantic Charter" promise that all countries must obtain equal treatment in world trade and raw materials, then peace in the Pacific is possible. The company said that if Japanese Special Envoy Saburo Kurusu brings genuine proposals, he will be heard with sympathy in Washington. We believe that if Britain and Japan work together, President Roosevelt's "Atlantic Charter" can provide a solid foundation for peace in the Pacific. If British Prime Minister Churchill guarantees this and jointly proposes friendly mediation in the Chinese war with President Roosevelt, then the key lies in Tokyo's reply.

### Canada Announces Sending Troops to Strengthen Defense of the Far East; First Batch of Troops Arrives in Hong Kong; Burma Expands Ban on Imports of Japanese Goods

Reuters, Ottawa, 16th: Canadian Prime Minister King recently announced the news of Canadian troops arriving in Hong Kong. The number of troops was not announced, but it was only stated that they will form the defense force of Hong Kong together with other Imperial troops. It also stated that these troops will be led by Brigadier Lawson. King also said that defending against real or threatened aggression in any part of the world is part of the defense of all countries that still enjoy freedom today. Based on this view, the Canadian government believes that it should send Canadian troops to cooperate with troops from other parts of the British Commonwealth currently stationed in East Asia.

Reuters, Hong Kong, 16th: This morning, the citizens here woke up and suddenly saw a large transport ship, accompanied by several escort ships, entering the port and unloading the Canadian troops it was carrying. These troops were transferred here to strengthen the garrison force. It was kept strictly confidential beforehand, and the citizens had no knowledge of it. However, after the news of the arrival spread, the streets of Kowloon were filled with welcoming people waiting for the troops to march past. The first to board the ship were the Governor of Hong Kong and the Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in Hong Kong, Major General Maltby, who formally welcomed the Canadian commander to land. At the same time, reporters from various newspapers surrounded the Canadian soldiers to seek news information. Many of the Canadian troops participated in the last Great War. Many of them have also served overseas in this war. Several officers told reporters that although they did not know the details of their mission here, they were prepared to assume any responsibility. The voyage lasted several weeks and was safe and uneventful. The weather was good and no enemy ships were found. The troops landed in very good order. They first gathered at the parade ground opposite the pier. After the entire army gathered, they marched through the main streets of Kowloon with a military band leading the way, and Major General Maltby held a review. The magnificence of the military appearance left a deep impression on the onlookers, and the arrival of these troops has had a great effect on the morale of the Chinese residents. Currently, various arrangements have been made for the comfort and happiness of the Canadian soldiers here, with particular attention to sports.

Reuters, Singapore, 16th: General Pownall, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Far East, recently telegraphed his welcome to the Canadian troops arriving in Hong Kong, saying that he was very pleased to have Canadian troops stationed in the area under his command. Pownall was engaged in the Imperial Air Training Plan in Canada during the first winter of this war, so he has many friends there.

Reuters, Rangoon, 16th: The Governor of Burma yesterday issued an order expanding the ban on imports of Japanese goods into Burma. Almost all kinds of goods are prohibited from entering. Anyone who wants to transport Japanese goods into the country must obtain a special permit.

### Ambassador Hu Shih Delivers Speech in the United States: China Is Determined to Fight to the End

United Press, Orleans, 16th: Chinese Ambassador to Washington Dr. Hu Shih said yesterday while addressing Tulane University here that if China can obtain more supplies, it can achieve better results in the past fifty-two months. He said, "I can definitely guarantee that our people will fight to the end until we achieve the goals of national independence and freedom from aggression." Dr. Hu Shih said that there are five main facts that can enable China to maintain its normality, namely, exchanging time for space, China's extremely large population, China's unprecedented unity in history, domestic revival, and American aid.

### U.S. Builds New Naval Base in California for Small Warships

Havas, San Francisco, 16th: The U.S. government is building a new naval base in Morro Bay, California, for small warships, at a total cost of $500,000. Rear Admiral Greenslade, commander of the U.S. Navy's 12th Naval District, gave a speech at the port yesterday, stating that the U.S. Navy is strong enough to cope with a single attack by any naval power, but if the Axis powers act together and the United States is isolated and helpless, then the situation will be different. The United States Navy is not only superior to all countries in the world in terms of overall quantity, but also in terms of the combat power of each warship or sailor, it is the champion of the world.

Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 16th: According to news from the Washington correspondent obtained here yesterday, the U.S. Navy Department has ordered 21 military airships from the Zeppelin Company in Ohio, six of which are already under construction. The Navy authorities intend to use these airships for patrolling in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Their officers and crew are being trained. The U.S. Navy currently has ten airships and 26 trained officers and 400 crew members. Six of them have joined the Navy, and the remaining four are for training purposes. Each of the new airships under construction has a crew of eight. Its new bases will be built in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, and Shearville, California, in the first half of next year.

### U.S. President Meets with Secretary of the Army to Discuss Taking Over Factories

United Press, Washington, 16th: President Roosevelt met with Secretary of War Stimson and Seventh Army Corps Commander Lee for an hour yesterday. It is rumored that they discussed the Army's possible takeover of coal mines in the event of a strike.

Reuters, Washington, 16th: United Mine Workers leader Lewis claimed last night after a three-hour meeting of labor and management representatives that the steel company coal mine dispute has not been resolved and that the deadline for a temporary no-strike agreement will expire at midnight. A total of 53,000 miners work in steel company coal mines. The union in Birmingham has issued a notice that if the Washington meeting fails, 8,000 miners there will begin a strike at midnight. In fact, the last important time is early Monday morning, because miners do not normally work on Sundays, so there is still a possibility that the two sides will continue to meet on Sunday to reach a final agreement.

### General de Gaulle Delivers Speech: Free French Charter Strives for Freedom and Equality

### Japanese Emperor Attends Special Diet, Orders Speedy Passage of Supplementary Budget; Delivers Brief Opening Address Without Mentioning Foreign Relations; Tojo and Shimada Report on Sino-Japanese War Situation Separately

United Press, Tokyo, 16th: The Japanese Diet opened a special session today, with the Emperor ordering the Diet to pass a supplementary budget and other emergency bills to cope with the current situation. However, the Emperor did not mention the serious Japan-U.S. relations that are the main reason for convening the special session. The Emperor's speech was the shortest in history, disappointing observers who expected the Emperor to give special instructions to the Diet. Experts also hold the generally accepted view that this special session is the most important in Japanese history due to the unprecedented crisis, especially regarding the tense relations between the U.S. and Japan. The Emperor also did not mention Japan's close relations with its treaty allies and Japan's efforts to establish world peace. The Emperor wore a military uniform at the official opening of the Diet. Many foreign reporters and diplomats also wore morning dress to attend the opening ceremony. The Emperor's edict stated: "We order the Ministers of State to submit to the Diet a supplementary budget bill and other legislative bills necessary to cope with the current situation. You should do your best to handle these matters in accordance with Our will." Immediately after the opening ceremony, the Diet held a plenary session to pass a reply to the Emperor's edict. Then, Prime Minister and concurrently Army Minister Tojo and Navy Minister Shimada reported on the Sino-Japanese War situation.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Political circles in Japan are now looking forward to the extraordinary session of the Diet on Monday. The Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Finance Minister will all deliver speeches. This extraordinary session is the first since the Sino-Japanese War in 1937. In the 51 years since the establishment of the Japanese Diet, extraordinary sessions have only been held 14 times. The Japanese newspapers unanimously believe that this meeting is more important than previous meetings. Although the Konoe Cabinet had planned to convene twice, both were cancelled. In view of the tense situation in the Pacific, the completion of the anti-Japanese front by the U.S., Britain, China, and the Netherlands, and in order to end the Sino-Japanese War, the Tojo Cabinet must inform the public of the policies adopted by Japan. It is reported that the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister will announce the details of the Washington talks and Kurusu's mission to the U.S., as well as the determination to end the Sino-Japanese War and realize the new order in the Far East. The Finance Minister will announce a tax increase to increase revenue by 700 million yen.

Reuters, London, 16th: Japan began a five-day temporary Diet session yesterday, which is said to be deciding on major plans for Japan's future. Prime Minister Tojo is expected to inform the Diet in detail of the plan decided by the cabinet today or tomorrow, and to allow it to vote on methods that can determine the issue of peace or war in the Pacific. Undoubtedly, the long-standing war of nerves has now reached its extreme, and a crisis is imminent. Many remarks in the past ten days have indicated how Washington is preparing to cope with the possibility of war in the Pacific, and British Prime Minister Churchill recently delivered a speech at London City Hall warning Japan. However, the Japanese government will respond to these remarks by conscripting reservists and greatly increasing military spending, so the situation in the Far East has deteriorated greatly. However, authoritative sources in London do not believe that Japan has burned its last ship, but if Japan must carry out its current policies, it will soon find itself in a position from which it cannot easily extricate itself. This kind of action will have extremely tragic consequences. The reaction in London official circles is still as stated by Churchill the other day: Britain does not want to fight in the Far East, but if it is forced to fight, Britain has no choice but to accept this situation gladly and resolutely.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Fifty-six members of the Kokumin Domei in the Japanese House of Representatives yesterday decided to support Imperial policy. This resolution will be submitted for discussion when the House of Representatives begins debate tomorrow. The resolution calls for the government to issue a statement opposing "America's intolerable attitude."

### If Japan Invades India and Burma, China Will Spare No Effort in Counter-Attacking: President Dai's Broadcast to India and Burma

Chongqing - The China International Broadcasting Station broadcast a friendly program to India and Burma from 6:30 PM to 7:20 PM on the 15th. President Dai of the Examination Yuan personally came to the station to deliver an address and generously donated a complete set of Indian music records given to him by the poet Tagore during his visit to India last year. Additionally, Mr. Lin Donghai, a counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gave a speech in English. The following is the text of President Dai's address:

Brothers and sisters of India and Burma, on this day of the Ox, I am representing the 450 million compatriots of China to visit our brothers and sisters of India and Burma. Today, I am also very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to you all through this broadcast. Although I left India and Burma almost a year ago, in this past year, the majestic and splendid Shwedagon Pagoda, the magnificent and extraordinary Buddhist sites of Bodh Gaya, Ajanta, and Ellora, and the countless kind and lovable men and women of India and Burma have constantly appeared before my eyes. The Shwedagon Pagoda and many holy sites in India are guarantees of selflessness, impartiality, and putting others before oneself. The people of India and Burma are models of diligence, thrift, hard work, and love of peace. I was honored to visit India and Burma last year and received a sincere welcome from all sectors of society. I am truly grateful for your friendship. However, I deeply know that your intention is to use me to convey the feelings of affection from your countries to the people of China. After returning to China, I fully conveyed the deep friendship of the two countries to my compatriots. The people of our country were greatly moved to hear of the sincere sympathy from our neighbors during the four years of difficult and arduous resistance against foreign invasion. India, Burma, and China have enjoyed a friendship of nearly a thousand years. The peoples of the three countries have loved peace since ancient times. Despite sharing thousands of miles of borders, there has never been any conflict or war. Those who traveled between us were either enlightened monks or scholars seeking knowledge, for the sake of Dharma and Tao, to save humanity, to spread learning, to enhance culture, and to promote peace. Therefore, our friendship of thousands of years has been maintained and has grown even closer. When I visited India and Burma last year, I informed the people of both countries about how Japan, our eastern neighbor, first broke the peace and caused a world war. I believe you still remember. In the past year, China's loyal and brave soldiers have united as one to resist the invaders. Japan has not gained an inch of progress. On the contrary, this autumn, we achieved a great victory in the battle of northern Hunan, and all the people of China feel that final victory is not far away. Today, Japan is at the end of its rope and wants to make a desperate gamble by advocating a southward advance. I and the people of China all believe that if Japan takes this action, its failure can be expected very soon. If Japan invades India and Burma, China will spare no effort in counter-attacking, so that Japan will not dare to move its troops from the Chinese mainland to attack India and Burma. China, India, and Burma have vast lands and abundant resources, accounting for one-third of the world's population. Defeating Japan will certainly not be difficult. In the past, our countries have communicated with each other, supported each other in times of distress. Now, with tyranny before us, the cooperation and mutual assistance of the three countries will be even more significant, in order to fulfill the historical mission of creating world peace that the peoples of China, India, and Burma have pursued for thousands of years. I take this opportunity to extend my greetings to my good friends in India and Burma, and wish both countries prosperity, the people happiness, and the friendship between India, Burma, and China to grow even closer.

### Unifying National Tax Administration: National Tax Agency to Be Established; Ministry of Finance Currently Drafting Regulations for Handling National Taxes

Chongqing - The Ministry of Finance is currently drafting regulations to unify the national tax administration agencies to handle national taxes. This agency may be called the National Tax Agency in the future. China's current tax agencies are extremely diverse due to the evolution of circumstances. For example, the Customs Administration is in charge of customs duties, the Salt Administration Department and the Salt Affairs Bureau are in charge of salt taxes, and the Direct Tax Office is in charge of stamp tax, income tax, inheritance tax, and excess profit tax. In addition, there is also the Tax Administration, which is in charge of various commodity taxes, and the Taxation Department, which is in charge of land tax and other local taxes. Therefore, the procedures for investigating, collecting, and auditing various taxes are extremely complicated. After the new agency is established, it can centrally handle these matters.

### Chongqing Newspapers Place Great Importance on the US Withdrawal of Marines, Believing That a US-Japan War Will Break Out Quickly, and That the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union Will Firmly Respond

Chongqing - Official sources only stated that the US withdrawal of Marines in China is a precautionary measure by the US regarding the Pacific issue, and were unwilling to comment further. This morning, various newspapers stated that this move by the US proves the seriousness of the situation in the Pacific, with some even saying that war is inevitable. The Central Daily News titled its article "The Pacific Is No Longer Peaceful" and asserted that a US-Japan war is not only difficult to avoid but will also break out quickly. The newspaper stated that Japanese militarists have always been insatiable in their aggression. Now that the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union have recognized this point, they will surely respond firmly. The Ta Kung Pao stated that the overall situation in the Pacific is indeed tense, and Britain and the United States are preparing for war. What medicine is Kurusu carrying in his gourd will soon be revealed. Therefore, the trends in the overall situation in the Pacific will be apparent within the next three days.

### Land Finance Department of the Agricultural Bank to Purchase Lands from Big Landlords First; Select Sites in Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, and Shaanxi Provinces for Implementation, Leasing the Land to Tenant Farmers with Government Support

Chongqing - Huang Tong, head of the Land Finance Department of the Farmers Bank of China, said that the department's fund of 10 million yuan has been allocated by the authorities. They will first select three or four counties with land problems in Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, and Shaanxi provinces, and purchase land from big landlords in stages. The land will then be leased to tenant farmers, with government support, so that they have the ability to repay the land price in installments. In this way, tenant farmers can become owner-farmers in a few years. Huang also said that when large-scale implementation is carried out in the future, land bonds must be issued to provide cash and avoid inflation. (16th Havas dispatch)

### Review of Japan's Extraordinary Diet Session

The 77th extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet, which opened on the 15th of this month, was convened at the suggestion of Prime Minister Tojo shortly after he took office. According to custom, the Japanese Diet convenes in mid-December each year. After opening, it is temporarily adjourned and resumes its proceedings in January of the following year. Now, with only one month separating this from the customary convocation date, Tojo hastily convened an extraordinary session. At a time when the United States had just revised its Neutrality Act and Kurusu had gone to the United States for final negotiations, this action naturally attracted the attention of all parties in the world. Some even prepared to judge the direction of Japanese policy based on the results of this Diet session.

Reviewing the history of the Japanese Diet over the past fifty years, it cannot be denied that it has played a significant role in Japanese politics, especially in the decade or so after World War I, which was its golden age. However, according to the provisions of the Japanese Constitution, the main powers of the Japanese Diet are only the right to cooperate in legislation and the right to cooperate in the budget. In addition, the levying and increasing of taxes must also be approved by the Diet. This is very different from the legislative bodies of other democratic countries in the world, which possess supreme power. The determination of national policies and the personnel of government agencies do not necessarily have to be subject to the constraints of the Diet. After the May 15th Incident, the Japanese political situation completely deviated from constitutional norms, and successive cabinets were established as "extraordinary" in nature. Their relationship with the Diet became increasingly distant. In particular, when Konoe advocated the "New Political System Movement" last year, he prepared to reform the Diet, limiting its function to "supporting the throne." For a time, the Diet members were as silent as cicadas, and the political parties dissolved one after another. Although this resulted in no achievements, it made the Diet, which was already like a fattened sheep, even more lifeless. To this day, if one says that the Japanese government must wait for the Diet's approval before deciding on domestic and foreign policies, everyone knows that this is not the case. Thus, the so-called preparation by Tojo to have the Diet vote on the issue of war and peace in the Pacific is clearly nothing more than comparing Japan's "extraordinary" politics to the usual practices of Western democratic countries, and is of no use. The convocation of the extraordinary session of the Diet is undoubtedly of great significance, but it is only to obtain broad national support after the Japanese government has decided on its policies, rather than deciding its advance or retreat based on the Diet's approval or disapproval—even if it were to do so, it would only be a matter of form, and the real decision-making power is not in the Diet. This is because, first, the Japanese Diet still holds the major powers conferred by the Constitution—passing laws and budgets, and approving increases in taxes; second, between the Japanese government and the people, the Diet is still an important intermediary, and cannot be replaced by organizations such as the "Central Cooperative Council for Supporting the Throne." Before the Japanese Diet system has been fundamentally changed, no matter how powerful the government is, it still cannot do without the Diet's assistance on such issues. This is probably the main reason why Tojo convened the extraordinary session of the Diet. The policy statement that Tojo is preparing to issue today can be valued, but what is more noteworthy is his proposal to establish a wartime system, the additional supplementary budget of 3.8 billion yuan for military expenses, the new tax plan of 600 million to 700 million yuan, and even the "additional budget proposal to prepare for the adaptation of the new domestic system." In short, all of these are to accelerate the completion of "wartime preparedness," which the Japanese government regards as the most central task. The Japanese people's views on this are not fully known, but judging from the situation shown by the Japanese Diet in recent years, it is clear that there is no expectation of major support. Even if views like those of Saito Takao have not disappeared, probably no one would dare to bravely repeat his mistakes.

As for Japan's future direction, rather than waiting for the results of the extraordinary session of the Diet, it is better to examine the current international situation and the various measures taken by the Japanese government to gain a clearer understanding. Between these two situations, there is currently a contradiction: the latter is determined to expand and move towards the path of war preparations. Especially since the establishment of the Tojo Cabinet, on the one hand, political affairs and strategy have been integrated, and on the other hand, strict internal control has also been completed. This, combined with its already implemented "national mobilization" and "construction of a highly national defense system," has made its desire to expand by means of war almost uncontrollable. However, on the other hand, in the current international situation, Japan is facing an unprecedentedly difficult juncture. It has become impossible to extricate itself from the stalemated Sino-Japanese war, and the intensified cooperation of the ABCD line, the declaration of the final determination of Britain and the United States, and the completion of preparations for contingency measures in the Far East have made Japan face the dilemma of being immediately surrounded on all sides throughout the Pacific if it acts recklessly. Whether it advances south, north, or west, there are considerable difficulties. Its ally, Nazi Germany, even if it can dominate the European continent, has almost zero strength outside of Europe, and its piracy at sea and its strategy against the Soviet Union are far from sufficient to support Japan. The subjective situation of Japan is like this, and the shape of the international situation is like that. As long as rational control is not lost, it must be clear that this is definitely not the time to act recklessly. Because of the existence of this contradictory situation, despite being surrounded by extreme elements and war enthusiasts, and despite the declaration of the firm stance of Britain and the United States, the Tojo Cabinet still wants to send Kurusu to travel across the ocean to make a final mediation, although it is unlikely to put forward a plan acceptable to democratic countries. Therefore, in this session of the Diet, the attitude that Tojo may declare is likely to be a flexible policy rich in opportunism, but it will not relax the "wartime" deployment and preparation, and at a minimum, it should be based on "resolving the China Incident." This situation, even if it appears moderate on the surface, cannot conceal its inherent explosive danger, which is what all relevant parties should be extremely vigilant about.

### Moscow Radio Announces Soviet Victory on All Fronts; Germans Build Forts to Prepare for Winter

Reuters, 16th, London - Moscow Radio announced that Soviet troops had won repeated victories on the front line from the Arctic Ocean to the south. The German attempt to reach the fishermen's peninsula in the Arctic Ocean failed. Twenty Axis ships were sunk. Enemy artillery positions in the Karelian front were destroyed one by one by Soviet artillery. The enemy repeatedly tried to attack but failed. Soviet aircraft attacked at low altitude on the Leningrad front, destroying German truck convoys carrying military supplies. German losses are increasing along the road to Tula (110 miles south of Moscow). The German plan for a frontal attack has failed, and their attempt to flank the Soviet army has also been ineffective. According to news from the southern front received by Moscow, the Caucasian troops in the Don region have been annihilating the invading enemy soldiers every day for the past 35 days. A fierce battle took place in the area of Soyavka. The Germans initially gained the advantage, but the Caucasian cavalry counterattacked, fighting against overwhelming odds, driving the Germans into the river. The Germans later attacked again, and Soyavka changed hands five times, but the Germans eventually died or drowned in the river. It is reported that the Germans lost a total of five regiments. The German military reporter on the radio last night said that the German troops on the eastern front were progressing slowly due to abnormal weather. Heavy rain and muddy roads, and strong winds. Such wind and rain are unusual before mid-January, so the army is moving more slowly than in the summer, but the final victory depends on the morale of the German army. The latest Soviet communiqué stated that there were battles on all fronts yesterday. On November 14, 44 German aircraft were shot down, and the Soviet air force also lost 10 aircraft. On November 15, 4 German aircraft were shot down near Moscow.

Reuters, 16th, London - According to the latest news received here, although the Nazis continue to attack fiercely, the Soviet army has taken the initiative in many areas. The Germans are now building forts and machine gun positions along the entire 1,200-mile front line, apparently preparing to defend the front line during the winter.

TASS, 16th, Geneva - The German losses on the eastern front are so heavy that every German family has felt it. Therefore, German newspapers can no longer conceal it. Recently, the Berlin Stock Exchange openly admitted that every person in Germany currently has relatives who have died on the front line, but asked the public to understand the difficulties and prepare for even greater sacrifices.

### US Lend-Lease Administrator Harriman Flies to London to Adjust Aid to Britain and the Soviet Union; US Merchant Ships Are Being Fitted with Guns

Reuters, 16th, New York - Lend-Lease administrator Harriman flew to London yesterday to continue handling the adjustment of aid to Britain and the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease Act. He told reporters that the UK and the US have a large number of supplies being transported to the Soviet Union. He has ample evidence to prove that the Soviet Union is currently making good use of these supplies. Five Republican members of the House of Representatives also flew to England on the same plane to stay in England for 18 days, to study the UK's war effort and the effectiveness of Lend-Lease aid, as well as the UK's solutions to civil defense and labor issues.

Havas, 15th, Egyptian Capital - A US automobile delegation, led by General Bierer, will soon arrive in the Iranian capital to inspect the situation of US aircraft, weapons, and other goods being transported to the Soviet Union via the Iranian port of Basra.

Reuters, 16th, Washington - Although the Neutrality Act Amendment will not take effect until Monday, according to sources responsible here, some US merchant ships are currently being fitted with guns, and sailors in various ports are currently being assigned to load supplies directly to Britain in the middle of next week. The Navy Department will certainly not announce its plan to protect US merchant ships, but there are signs that warships are escorting the ships. According to news from New York, the Maritime Commission currently plans to send three more merchant ships across the Atlantic to Britain each week. New freighters will continue to be launched, about three each week. These new freighters are all equipped with gun mounts and some secret self-defense features. Naval sources claim that merchant ships currently at sea will also be armed upon their return. It is estimated that 300 of the 1,200 US merchant ships will be equipped with three-inch and five-inch guns.

United Press, 16th, Washington - US ships and aircraft escorting armed merchant ships across the Atlantic can use British bases, so that a huge amount of US war supplies can be transported to Britain. Officials declined to comment on this report, but authoritative sources said, "This is a reasonable guess" because this new route sailed by American ships should receive complete protection. Because the Neutrality Act Amendment was passed by Congress last week, merchant ships can sail into combat zones and combat ports, and the US Atlantic Fleet can use this new base to protect merchant ships.

Haitong News Agency, 16th, Madrid - According to news from New York, the US Navy Department has drafted a four-month plan to arm American merchant ships. A total of 400 ships will begin to be armed, and 100 ships can leave the arsenal each week. All the cannons currently available are sufficient to equip 400 ships. There is a type of five-inch cannon that also serves as an anti-aircraft gun and an anti-submarine gun. Gunmen are supplied by the Navy Department. Depending on the size of the ship, each ship will be assigned 10 to 16 gunmen. The bill to amend the Neutrality Act will likely be signed by President Roosevelt tomorrow, so that the arming of merchant ships can begin immediately. It is estimated that about 1,600 merchant ships will be armed. According to well-informed sources, due to the lack of raw materials, it will take a long time to complete the armament of the remaining 1,200 ships, in addition to the 400 ships.

European War Talk

### The Female Calamity in French Politics

She also wanted to find someone to use as a stepping stone for her own advancement. Daladier seemed to please her more than others, yet she didn't realize he was all surface. The famous novelist Daudet once said: "This wild bull only has the antennae of a snail." Daladier was burly and somewhat crude, a friend of boisterous gatherings. He was newly widowed with two young children, immersed in grief. Little did he expect that the son of a baker from a small southern town would capture the favor of a Marchioness. No wonder he was flattered.

He saw this woman caring for his health, commenting on his attire, and worrying about his future. He felt grateful and reciprocated with sincerity. Unknowingly, she had awakened an ambition he had never dared to admit.

These women all indulged in pleasure. Madame Gihou Mureau, a glamorous widow of an art dealer, conspired with Sarraut. Théodore, on the other hand, worked in the dressing room of the famous actress Marguerite at the Comédie-Française. On his desk was a photograph of Théodore with the inscription: "To my little pawn, respectfully presented by her protector." From this alone, one could see the depth of their affection.

At Mademoiselle Faur's house, we could also hear Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Reury using his poetic talent and tone to expound his opinions on foreign policy. The gathering place for the Radical Party was at Madame Sireyta's house, brimming with the freshness of spring. Madame Sireyta relied on her endless stream of friends to navigate between the socialist and centralist factions.

In Countess de Montgomery's white silk-decorated living room, we could meet the cream of the crop, including newspaper tycoons, cabinet ministers, and ambassadors from various countries.

The husband of Duchess d'Harcourt was a member of parliament, but she advocated for closer ties with Germany. She often expressed her views to influential members of parliament like Abetz and Hencke during social gatherings. Abetz was formerly an art professor in Karlsruhe, initially unknown, but later became a confidant of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. He was expelled from France in August 1939 for espionage, but now he has returned to Paris as the German ambassador to France. Hencke was a well-known correspondent for the German Frankfurter Zeitung. In 1927, a Parisian woman even committed suicide for him. Before the German invasion of France, he was the leader of a German spy ring stationed in Belgium and Brussels.

Even the most dignified men could not resist the temptation of women. Montel, known for his sharp voice, high collar, and black stockings, and considered to have a cold demeanor, was completely smitten by Madame Maginot, with her fair skin and complexion, and willingly submitted to her charms.

Another French actress, the dark-haired beauty, Arbell, encouraged the foreign minister of the Popular Front government, Delbos.

Former Prime Minister Chautemps, though known for his prudence, was manipulated at will by the slender fingers of the famous pianist Madame Durand-Texte. Despite having many children and grandchildren, he was so infatuated with beauty that he did not hesitate to divorce his wife, also breaking up a marriage so his dream lover could marry a clerk in his law firm.

The Freemasons, a French secret society, had great faith in Chautemps but, upon witnessing his scandalous behavior, severed ties with him. He did not care. On May 16th, as German troops advanced victoriously, Chautemps still addressed the French press, saying, "Gentlemen, I have good news for you! I am still capable. My new wife has just given birth to a child."

Let's not forget Pongue, the French permanent representative to the League of Nations, and the protector of Mademoiselle Ventura of the Comédie-Française. He once wrote a letter from Geneva to Madame Fontanges, saying, "When I think of your lovely jade body, I no longer curse the chaos in Central Europe." Fontanges was once a mistress of Mussolini, and the French ambassador to Italy, Chambrun, was reprimanded for interfering with Mussolini and her affair.

French politics was manipulated by beautiful women. All political changes were the result of their ambition and conspiracies. Amid internal and external troubles, they remained in a state of drunken stupor! The voices of revolution were heard everywhere. With the war looming, the panic of 1938 arrived, and Czechoslovakia was occupied by Germany, leading to the Munich Conference.

Hélène de Portes supported the Munich Agreement, while Reynaud strongly opposed it.

Back in 1934, Hélène, occasionally ill, went to Vienna for treatment. There she became acquainted with many leaders of the National Socialist parties in Germany and Austria. To this day, some accuse her of being bought by Hitler's men, using her and her relationship with Reynaud, and claiming Hélène received several rewards for their efforts. In reality, she had personal savings, and her wealth increased under Reynaud's guidance, so we dare not believe this accusation. However, her fascination with power and love of scheming are undeniable.

At one point, she was a political agent for the Habsburgs, but later turned against them. She even went to Belgium to visit the Duke of Guise, who was in exile and claimed to be the heir to the French throne. Although Reynaud was a staunch republican, she must have assured the Duke that Reynaud would work for him. Her dream was to make Reynaud infatuated with her and be her puppet in political conspiracies. Reynaud refused to hinder the Popular Front experiment, and even said he wanted to form a mixed cabinet, incorporating all parties from communist to far-right. However, the more Reynaud leaned left, the more Hélène leaned right.

After the Munich Conference, salon socializing became commonplace, and talk of a Franco-German agreement was prevalent. The leading women of Parisian society used pacifism, realism, and anti-communism as their mantra, using beauty as bait to influence political figures.

Using the pretext of holding a hunting exhibition in Berlin, Göring invited influential Parisian ladies, such as Montgomery, Hélène de Portes, d'Harcourt, and the Marquise de Crussol, to his magnificent home for cordial entertainment. As a result, when they returned to their country, their minds were filled with images of extreme luxury and sweet words. They had been swayed by the Nazis, and upon returning home, they sought to sway their friends.

However, Reynaud refused to agree. He declared that France had entered a bloodless period of war. He sharply criticized the French middle class, saying their political ideas were stolen from abroad. "People used to plagiarize French ideas. Now the middle class is digging its own grave, just like the aristocracy before the revolution. However, the aristocracy of the past died with a smile, while today's middle class is holding its own funeral rope."

That's how it was in the summer of 1939. Daladier lacked decisiveness, and the Marquise de Crussol's advice only made him more indecisive. He didn't declare war until the last second.

The inevitable finally arrived.

Hélène knew her time had come. She had to act swiftly. In fact, France had already turned to Reynaud, who would become the Clemenceau of the Second World War. Seeing Reynaud's growing popularity, the Marchioness continued to inform Daladier of all Reynaud's plans. (To be continued)

### Several Hundred Types of Food and Medicine: Retail Price Limits Announced; Import Association Submits for Approval by Authorities, to Be Implemented Tomorrow; Others to Be Announced Gradually; Equalization Board Orders Foreign Banks to Strictly Manage Export Exchange

According to authoritative banking sources, the Equalization Fund Committee has made comprehensive decisions on the issues of commodity prices and exchange rates in Shanghai. In implementation, it will continue to use a broader allocation method to supply foreign exchange for the import of essential goods and other secondary items. At the same time, it has ordered various friendly foreign banks to strictly manage the purchase of export exchange. With this two-pronged approach, not only can the illegal exchange market be eliminated, but the prices set by the Equalization Board – US$5.34375 and 3 pence 1/875 per pound – can be universally applied. The purchasing power of legal tender can be sustainably stabilized, and the abnormal price increases currently encountered can be completely eliminated. Moreover, the Municipal Council, in cooperation with the Equalization Board, will take the initiative to attack merchants who speculate and profit.

Suppliers Must Provide As Much As Possible

According to a public notice issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Qingbao Department, the local Import Association has submitted the first batch of retail prices, totaling more than 300 items, all of which are goods sold by foreign food companies and pharmacies. They have been approved by the two concession Municipal Councils as the maximum retail prices and have been announced in the Western newspapers of this (17th) day for reference by retail merchants and users. Because there are so many of these goods, and they are imported, translation takes time, so the Chinese newspapers will not be able to publish them simultaneously. Retail merchants who sell the above items must sell them at the limited prices from the 18th of this month and must not exceed them. They should also supply customers to the extent of their normal needs as much as possible. (See Public Notice No. 5596 in today's Western newspapers for detailed prices.) Subsequent price lists will be published gradually as they are obtained.

Flour Merchants Plan to Smuggle Goods Out of the Country

Since the authorities in this city controlled prices, flour hoarders have used various methods in the past few days to secretly move thousands of bags of flour out of the concession in an attempt to transport them to North China to obtain better prices. This has now been discovered and stopped by the Municipal Council. It is reported that the flour merchants planned to transport over one million bags of flour out of the concession. The sudden order issued by the Municipal Council to prohibit movement was unexpected by the flour merchants. It is reported that dozens of cargo ships, fully loaded with flour, attempted to leave the concession a few days ago, but were all stopped by the Municipal Council. The owners gathered at the Municipal Council's Price Control Office, requesting permission to release the goods, but were all rejected and expelled by Mr. Patterson. According to Mr. Patterson, shipments of flour must be inspected by the Municipal Council before they can be approved. If there is a legitimate reason for transporting flour, it will be approved. It is reported that after the Municipal Council's economic strategy, flour prices have plummeted, and flour hoarders have suffered significant losses. Mr. Patterson also hopes for assistance from the public and the press.

Coal Catty Exchange Rate Needs Reduced Again

Local legitimate coal merchants purchasing Yanbaimei coal catties can now obtain huge amounts of foreign exchange. In the future, coal catties shipped to Shanghai will increase even more, and coal catty hoarders are not without fear, eagerly seeking to lower the price of domestic goods and release them onto the market. In recent days, the spot market for coal has shown an oversupply, but people are tired and unwilling to hoard at high prices, so the outlet for spot goods is quite sluggish. The entire coal market is currently showing a slump. According to news from various coal industry associations, the sales prices of Yanbaimei coal catties, regardless of high or low quality, have fallen by 100 to 200 yuan per ton compared to half a month ago. If they are released at the current market price, coal merchants holding goods can still obtain very generous profits. The stockpiles of various coal yards in this city (including Pudong, Hongkou, Huxi, and the French Concession) are still extremely full. According to estimates by those familiar with the coal market, the current coal stockpile has increased to about 480,000 tons. Including the coal catties purchased by various user factories, the total coal stockpile in the city should be over 500,000 tons. Recently, due to the sharp increase in coal prices, various users have reduced their consumption, so the monthly coal demand has decreased. During this time of oversupply and sluggish sales, coal yard stockpiles will become even more full.

150,000 Tons Transacted Recently

According to news from major coal companies, in recent days, various coal merchants have been proactively increasing their coal yard stockpiles in preparation for unforeseen circumstances. They have been sending telegrams to various coal-producing areas overseas to continue ordering large quantities of Yanbaimei coal catties. It is reported that in the last ten days, over 150,000 tons of coal catties have been ordered, with a production price of only US$2.3 per ton. Although the transportation cost exceeds the production price, there is still a considerable profit. The spot goods currently traded in the market are mostly those that were shipped earlier, and the profit per ton is even greater.

The End of Speculative Rice Hoarding Has Arrived

Regarding which goods are the important items for the second step of control, Municipal Council officials refused to disclose, saying that this is the only way to prevent hoarders from grasping the situation. It is reported that the trend of hoarding and raising prices for some goods has not stopped slightly, but it is only a matter of time. It is reported that the Municipal Council's Price Control Office has created a form listing the rice stockpiles of various rice stores for verification. From now on, the major problem of rice hoarding and monopoly can be curbed. Since the Municipal Council stipulated rice prices, rice hoarders have suffered losses of over 60 million yuan. In the past few weeks, Municipal Council officials have been quite successful in managing prices.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Invites Bids for 500 Tons of Edible Oil

The Municipal Council recently issued an announcement stating that the Council, with the permission of the Equalization Fund Committee, is preparing to invite bids for the purchase of edible oil. The quantity to be purchased is up to 500 tons. In the future, the sale of this edible oil will be closely supervised by the Council, and its price will also be controlled by the Council. Those who are willing to bid for the purchase should immediately submit detailed terms and conditions, along with oil samples, to the Council's Price Control Office, Room 171, before 5 p.m. on the 20th of this month for verification.

### Survey of the City for the Required Amount of Soybeans

The Tofu Industry Association reports that the price of soybeans used to make tofu has risen to about 110 yuan per 100 market catties due to general speculative hoarding, which is 30% higher than the current price of rice (rice is 130 yuan per 160 market catties, while soybeans are 110 yuan per 100 market catties). Other items such as fuel, salt brine, and gypsum have also doubled compared to last month. The members of the association feel it is difficult to maintain operations and have written to the association requesting relief. Furthermore, some members in Hongkou and Nanshi temporarily closed down for several days due to losses. They have since resumed operations after being persuaded by the association. According to a Datsung News Agency reporter, the association has submitted a request to the authorities in the two concessions to lower the price of soybeans. They have now drafted a form and will send staff to various shops starting tomorrow to survey the daily soybean requirements in order to provide thorough relief.

### Merchant Corps to Take Over U.S. Defense Zone; British and Americans Agree; No Confirmation Yet on Arrival Date of Troop Withdrawal Ship

The 4th U.S. Marine Regiment in Shanghai, with a long history of 14 years, received orders to withdraw from Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, stationed in Manila. They have been preparing to withdraw in the shortest possible time. According to well-informed sources, Colonel Howard, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in Shanghai, sent a letter to the Japanese naval and military authorities yesterday to notify them of the withdrawal. However, this information could not be confirmed by the U.S. Marine Corps as of last night. However, U.S. consular authorities revealed yesterday that Washington had not issued any new instructions to evacuate Americans from Shanghai.

No Confirmation Yet on Troop Withdrawal Ship

As for the ships withdrawing the U.S. defense forces, one source says it is the U.S. President liner McKinley, which has remained stationed in Manila and has not left the Far East coast. The McKinley is one of the newest giant ships built by the U.S. Shipping Administration and is considered a sister ship to the President Coolidge. It was originally scheduled to come to Shanghai on its maiden voyage. The ship is currently docked in Hong Kong and will set sail for Shanghai soon. Another source says the ship taking over the U.S. defense forces will be the U.S. transport ship Henderson, which has already come to Shanghai from the Pacific. Yet another source says that the President Taft has been dispatched to take over from Manila and that the first group will leave Shanghai within three days escorted by a U.S. destroyer. However, as this concerns military matters, the headquarters of the 4th U.S. Marine Regiment is unwilling to comment. It is said that the 750 U.S. troops in Shanghai and the 165 U.S. troops in Peiping have decided to complete the withdrawal within two weeks.

Merchant Corps to Take Over Defense Zone; British and Americans Agree

Colonel Howard, Commander of the U.S. forces in Shanghai, will be the last to leave Shanghai. After the U.S. troops withdraw, what will happen to the defense zone west of Yu Chaching Road and south of Suzhou Creek in the International Settlement? This has been a major concern for all parties. According to sources, the Municipal Council has already received the approval of the British and Americans. They plan to follow the precedent set during the British troop withdrawal last August and hand over the defense to the Municipal Council's International Merchant Corps, as the area is of great importance to British and American interests. As for the troop withdrawal issue, the U.S. consular office in Shanghai remained silent yesterday. However, some believe that although this move by the United States is not preparing for war with Japan, the fact that U.S. merchant ships will be armed and enter the territorial waters of belligerent countries means that the United States has abandoned neutrality. The withdrawal of U.S. troops in China already implies the attitude that the United States will adopt towards the situation in the Far East in the future.

U.S. Troops in North China Reportedly Coming to Shanghai

The 55-man U.S. Embassy guard in Peiping and the 165-man defense force in Tianjin have been ordered to withdraw and will be concentrated in Shanghai by special ship before being jointly withdrawn. The first group to be withdrawn will be 300 men, and the ships ordered to come to Shanghai are of great tonnage and sufficient to accommodate them. As for the Americans remaining in Shanghai, there have been no new orders for another evacuation. In other words, the original evacuation order remains in effect. The British Consulate in Shanghai hopes that non-essential women and children without special reasons for staying in Shanghai will evacuate immediately.

### The Saint Nabertin Arrives in Port Carrying Coal and 2,500 Tons of Cement

The Saint Nabertin, a French Postal Company liner, arrived in Shanghai from Haiphong yesterday morning and docked at No. 14 and 15 pontoons on the Huangpu River. The ship carries 2,000 tons of coal and 2,500 tons of cement, which will be unloaded in Shanghai.

### Lunch Boxes from the Concession Prohibited from Being Transported to Nanshi

Since the authorities in the two concessions suppressed the price of rice within the concession, these foreign rice are completely supplied by the Shanghai Municipal Council, so it is prohibited to transport it to non-concession areas such as Huxi and Nanshi. All lunch box businesses in the two concessions that contract lunch boxes in Nanshi and Huxi are prohibited from delivering from yesterday onwards. Yesterday evening, a Datsung News Agency reporter toured various check points and saw dozens of lunch boxes waiting to be transported at each location, but they were still unable to be sent in. They completely dispersed around 9 p.m. — Wang Jingrong

### Installation of Fluorescent Lamps and the Electricity Company's Management Regulations

— Wang Jingrong

According to the table above, if a 60-cycle lamp is used on a 50-cycle current, the light emitted is 10% more than a 50-cycle lamp, but the power consumption is 30% more, and the lifespan is reduced to less than half of a 50-cycle lamp. Comparing the two, the advantages and disadvantages are immediately apparent. Users must pay attention for their own benefit.

Power Factor

Fluorescent lamps have a characteristic that the actual amount of electricity consumed is only 60% of the amount of electricity transmitted by the generator. In other words, if the generator outputs 100 units of current from the power line for a certain fluorescent lamp, only 60 of them produce useful work, and the remaining 40 return along the original path. Therefore, the power factor of ordinary tungsten filament lamps is 100%, while the power factor of fluorescent lamps is only 60%, because 40% of the current is not effective, but the transmission cost does not decrease (the capacity of the electricity bill is still 100%). Therefore, fluorescent lamps are low power factor electrical appliances. According to the regulations of the Shanghai Power Company, it is necessary to install power factor adjustment equipment.

Correction Principle

Since the advent of fluorescent lamps, there have been many inquiries about what power factor is and why it is necessary to correct the power factor. It is not easy for non-electrical engineers to understand this issue. Here, let's try to use an analogy to explain it.

Now, taking the transaction of carpets as an example, someone, Mr. A, goes to a carpet store and asks to have two carpets sent to his home. The store hires two rickshaws to deliver them. As a result, Mr. A only buys one of them, and orders the deliveryman to bring the other one back. The store pays for the round-trip fare for one more carpet, and must do extra bookkeeping work, resulting in a loss. If Mr. A often does this, the store will definitely not welcome his patronage if it does not directly or indirectly recover the cost of this service from him, because this kind of transaction is very unfair.

### Oil Tanker "Wu Jiang" Detained; Oil Unloaded Ashore

Since July 22nd, the Japanese side has detained the oil tanker "Wu Jiang," owned by British Asia Petroleum Company, and its 12 Chinese crew members. They are still under detention. It has been impossible to obtain information about this matter from the Japanese authorities, but it is said that the Japanese side will make an announcement about this soon. The "Wu Jiang" was detained by the Japanese side with a U.S. ship in July, when they were transporting oil along the Yangtze River Estuary. The U.S. ship was released immediately, but the "Wu Jiang" was detained in front of the Japanese wharf in Yangshupu Ham and unloaded the oil. The crew members were also detained. The Japanese side did not provide food, so the ship owner had to provide the 12 crew members with necessities. The British authorities have protested several times because of this. However, the Japanese side replied that the ship "had no right to sail in the Yangtze River Estuary."

### 20,000 Bags of Stored Foreign Rice to Be Released Today; Daily Sales Price: $130 Per Stone; Transport Permits Must Be Returned to the Association Immediately After Use

Two days ago, the Bean, Rice, and Grain Trade Association used a lottery method to first designate 20,000 bags of foreign rice stored by thirteen fellow merchants to be handed over to the Rice Management Committee for distribution to rice shops lacking rice within the Public Concession. The rice shops designated by the association have now started claiming the foreign rice from the warehouses. All rice distribution commenced at 10:20 AM today. The payment location is at Wanfeng Rice Shop, No. 1 Tianzhutang Street. The price is $160 per bag (224 pounds) and the retail price at the door is $130 per stone (160 market catties net weight), regardless of the type of foreign rice, whether it's Saigon Small Grain, Haiphong, or Siam.

The price is uniform.

After the rice distribution is completed, it must be sold at the door of each rice shop at the specified price. The Shanghai Rice Shop Trade Association yesterday specially sent representatives to contact the Rice Management Committee to collect and issue transport permits. To ensure utmost caution, the association formulated the following transport usage regulations at 4 PM that afternoon: All industry members who need to obtain a permit for transporting rice must return the permit to the association daily after use, without delay. This rice transport permit can only be used to transport rice and grain registered with the association and approved by the Municipal Council. The amount transported must not exceed the approved quantity. This permit is only

valid for one use.

It must not be lent to others for private use. If any of the above regulations are violated, once discovered, the shop will be strictly investigated. At that time, the association will specially send two responsible personnel to issue the permits. When paying for the rice, all rice shop personnel must present their market entry permit and shop seal, and then apply for the transport permit with the delivery order and entry permit. Yesterday, the Rice Shop Trade Association registered a total of 119 households, accounting for 7,720 bags of rice and grain. The association is still processing registrations today.

### The Case of Xu Songyao's Tragic Death to Be Investigated Tomorrow; All Involved Will Be Tried Together; Xu Xiangsun Sent to Sanatorium Due to Illness

The tragic deaths of Xu Songyao, the young owner of Huamei Pharmacy, and his chauffeur, Zheng Aqing, have seen significant progress in the investigation since the French police department had the two coffins brought to the Tulas Road mortuary for re-examination and thorough investigation. The truth has largely come to light. In addition to the principal offender, Xu Daquan, who is naturally detained, the case has also implicated French Concession police detectives Lu Zanyuan and Xu Kaitao, the photographer Lao Guangdong, and a clerk from the Tongren Fuyuan Hall named Miao, all of whom have been detained for investigation. Xu's father, Xiangsun, also surrendered to the police station last week. Due to suffering from severe hemoptysis, the police station approved his transfer to Wang Qizhang Sanatorium for treatment, and specially assigned detectives to guard him in shifts. As for the Xu Jihua and Xihua sisters, they have been released on bail by the police station. It is now known that the French police department has scheduled a public investigation of the case for tomorrow (the 18th). At that time, all the involved parties, including Xu Xiangsun, will be tried together, and numerous subpoenas will be issued, ordering relevant witnesses to appear in court for questioning.

### Second Day of Tuberculosis Prevention Publicity: Posting of Warning Slogans

To eradicate tuberculosis, the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association launched an expanded publicity and fundraising campaign the day before yesterday. In addition to hanging slogans on various roads, yesterday they also posted flyers on the display windows of major companies and shops, including: Do you know that Shanghai Tuberculosis Hospitals are overcrowded everywhere, with as many as five people per bed? Do you know that a tuberculosis patient can cough up 7 million tubercle bacilli in one sputum? Do you know that the tubercle bacilli in dried sputum can survive for seven or eight months? Do you know that if tuberculosis patients are not sent to isolation for treatment, every family will be at risk of being infected? Do you know that the best way to eradicate tuberculosis throughout the city is to donate to build anti-tuberculosis hospitals? The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association is raising one million yuan to build a large-scale anti-tuberculosis hospital so that patients can be isolated and treated, and those who are not sick can avoid infection. Our fates are intertwined, so please donate generously. The wording is extremely alarming.

### Time Bomb Explodes, One Dead; Xianyue Dance Palace Bombed; Most Threw Grenades

At 11:25 PM last night, a large time bomb suddenly exploded under a table at the Xianyue Dance Palace on Jing'an Temple Road. At the time, a dancer named Wang Zuying, 26 years old, from Shanghai, living at No. 2 Fuxu Lane, Fuxu Road, was passing by while dancing. His head was hit by the explosion, his skull shattered, and he fell to the ground, bleeding brain matter. Shrapnel also injured one male and one female dancer each. The male guest was named Zhou Ming, 21 years old, living at No. 5 Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road. The female guest was surnamed Zhang, 23 years old, living at No. 32, Lane 468, Xin Dagu Road. Both suffered head and facial injuries. When reporters went to investigate, they saw a pool of blood and brain matter in the pool, and many fragments of shattered glass. Wang Zuying died soon after without treatment because of the critical nature of his injuries. About half an hour before the bombing, several dancers had a conflict with a foreigner. As a result, a Zhang Juncai had his face and mouth injured, and two of his front teeth were knocked out. He was also taken to Binjiang Hospital by ambulance. The police are investigating the cause of the bombing.

At about 10 PM last night, someone suddenly threw a smoke grenade into the dance floor of the Metropolitan Dance Hall on Gordon Road. The hall was filled with light and dense smoke. The police were alerted and sent detectives to investigate. The person who threw the grenade had already fled.

### Yunnan Provincial Education Funds Will Be Disbursed Uniformly by the Central Government; To Be Incorporated into the New Revenue and Expenditure System Next Year

(Kunming Correspondence) The educational funds of this province have always been based on the cigarette tax and a portion of the rental income from educational official properties, with the majority relying on the cigarette tax. Since the formal division of national and local revenue and expenditure last July, the cigarette tax has been assigned to national tax and is received by the Yunnan Regional Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. The central government subsidizes 350,000 yuan per month for education funds, but the income from educational official properties is limited, resulting in a significant monthly shortfall. The Fudian New Bank has provided some bridging loans, but the fundamental problem has not been resolved. The National Financial Conference this year resolved to reform the national financial revenue and expenditure system, changing the three-tier system of county-province-national to a two-tier system of county-national. The provincial budget is incorporated into the national budget, and the provincial government has ordered all agencies to prepare their budgets for the next year and submit them to the central government for approval and uniform disbursement. After receiving the order, the Education Department has prepared a budget for education expenses for the next year and submitted it to the provincial government for forwarding to the central government for approval and disbursement, as well as submitting it to the Ministry of Education for approval. According to discussions with relevant parties in the Education Department, the problem of educational funds in this province can be completely resolved after uniform disbursement by the central government according to the new budget.

### Schools in Shaoxing Have Moved and Resumed Classes

### Fujian Provincial Library Organizes Mobile Libraries; Director Chen Actively Plans Development, Adding Reading Rooms and Circulation Stations

(Shaxian Correspondence) Since Chen Hongfei took over as director of the Fujian Provincial Library in Shaxian County, he has spared no effort in planning for development. It is now known that the library previously had the First Reading Room, but due to its location in a remote corner, reading was inconvenient. It has been agreed with the Special Party Department of the Fujian Military Control Zone to jointly operate a large-scale reading room in the lobby of the Zhongshan Hall. The hall is magnificent, with good air circulation and sufficient light, and can accommodate 200 people reading at the same time. It is scheduled to officially open on the anniversary of the fourth year of the War of Resistance. There are more than 40 kinds of domestic and foreign newspapers, more than 100 kinds of magazines, hundreds of reference books, and thousands of general books and anti-Japanese war reading materials. The number of readers is extremely crowded every day. Previously, the Third Reading Room of the library was located in the Shuinan East Station, but the reading room was small and could only accommodate a dozen or so readers, making development difficult. Recently, the Shaxian Zhongnan Travel Agency moved, and the library agreed to use the agency's lobby to jointly operate a large-scale reading room with the Provincial Transportation Company. Preparations are actively underway, and it is also planned to set up circulation book stations at various stations along the highway, such as Nanping, Sanyuan, Yong'an, and Liancheng. In order to meet the needs of the War of Resistance and facilitate reading during work breaks, the library has selected over a thousand books and established a mobile library, adopting the principle of "books seeking readers" specifically for public institutions in the county such as hospitals, citizens' schools, and social organizations. In addition, Chen Hongfei went to Fuzhou some time ago, as Fuzhou has just been recovered and all parties are in great need of spiritual nourishment, to prepare for the establishment of circulation stations and mobile libraries, and to restore the library's Fuzhou office, it is said.

### A Comparison of American and Japanese Economic Relations: What Impact Would a Complete Commercial Stoppage Have?

— Huang Xinmeng

The Pacific problem is becoming increasingly serious, and the possibility of a US-Japan war seems imminent. However, the ultimate outcome of modern warfare still depends on the economic strength of the belligerent nations. Therefore, on the eve of a storm in the Pacific, I would like to use a statistical perspective to briefly outline the general state of US-Japan economic relations as follows:

According to an economic expert, under the slogan of building a "New Order in East Asia," two issues deserve attention:  There may come a day when US-Japan trade comes to a complete halt;  Japan may interfere with US imports of rubber and tin from overseas, as Japan is in a strong position to control these two commodities.

If US-Japan commercial relations are completely severed, Japan will suffer more than the United States. First, in 1939, Japan obtained a significant amount of needed foreign exchange from the United States, and US purchases from Japan accounted for one-third of Japan's total exports. This does not include other countries in the yen bloc. From 1937 to 1939, Japanese silk accounted for 83 percent of the US silk market, almost entirely owned by Japan. If this market is lost, Japan's economy will undoubtedly suffer a major blow, as it would reduce the amount of foreign exchange Japan urgently needs to obtain.

Second, Japan's imports are also largely dependent on the United States. In 1938, American goods accounted for 34 percent of Japan's imports. In this regard, it is evident that this would weaken Japan's fighting power, as Japan buys important military raw materials such as gasoline, iron, metal products, machinery, and copper from the United States.

Japan's Dependence on the United States

Eight types of raw materials used in wartime account for 98 percent of Japan's total imports from the United States. The following table shows the percentage of Japan's imports of these eight raw materials from the United States compared to those from other countries.

Commodity Percentage

Gasoline 66

Scrap Iron 91

Ferrous Alloys 98

Copper 92

Metals and Alloys 99.6

Cars and Car Parts 77

Metalworking Machinery 70

Aircraft and Aircraft Parts 63

In this respect, Japan's situation is indeed very difficult. Of the thirty-two important military raw materials, Japan has a surplus for export in only two types, is self-sufficient in three types, produces insufficient quantities for domestic use and must import sixteen types, and is completely dependent on other countries for the other eleven types. In 1939, 56 percent of Japan's military raw materials were imported from the United States, 21 percent from the United Kingdom, and 8 percent from British Malaya, Canada, and India. Therefore, once the United Kingdom and the United States cooperate and implement a commercial embargo against Japan, Japan will suffer the most severe impact.

Such cooperation, if possible, could reduce Japan's supply of steel, gasoline, machinery, and, to a lesser extent, copper. Although Japan might be able to purchase these from other sources, such as aggregated supplies, economic applications, and increased production in mainland Japan and occupied areas, the result would inevitably be decentralization and higher costs, which would clearly weaken Japan's fighting power.

What Use are Japanese Goods Imported into the US?

On the other hand, we can also pay attention to the situation in the United States. The following table shows the percentages of important commodities imported by the United States from Japan and from other countries.

Commodity Percentage

Fish Fillets and Fish Oil 52

Pottery and Porcelain 51

Silk Fabrics 42

Rags 99.5

Cotton Rugs 99

Crab Meat, Soy Sauce, etc. 81

Oil Cakes 77

Fresh Flowers 72

Toys 66

Hat Materials 55

Bleached Cotton Cloth 52

It is clear that these items are not very important. Although raw silk accounted for 94 percent of US imports from Japan in 1938, silk is not of vital importance to the national life.

However, the above statistics are still incomplete. We can further consider what would happen if the United States were to have its imports of rubber and tin completely cut off by the Japanese Navy one day.

Almost 98 percent of the world's rubber is produced in the Far East. In 1939, US imports of rubber were valued at US$167 million, and the importance of rubber is even greater than other products. Of this, 57 percent was purchased from British Malaya, 18 percent from the Dutch East Indies, and the rest from French Indochina and Ceylon.

Approximately three-quarters of the world's tin production comes from the Federated Malay States, Bolivia, and the Dutch East Indies. In 1938, the United States purchased 74 percent of its tin imports, in terms of quantity, from Malaya, 7 percent from the United Kingdom, 7 percent from the Dutch East Indies and Hong Kong, and 13 percent from other countries.

From the above, it is clear that US imports of rubber and tin rely entirely on supplies from the Federated Malay States and the Dutch East Indies. But in the event of an accident, and these imports are hindered, can the United States find other markets to supply them?

The United States Has Many Options

According to a recent report by the Tax Commission, the United States consumed 590,100 tons of rubber in 1939, at a price of 17 cents per pound, but this had risen to 20 cents by 1940.

How much rubber has the United States contracted for in the coming year? In this regard, we can recall that in June 1939, the United States agreed with the United Kingdom that the United Kingdom would exchange 85,000 tons of rubber for 60,000 bales of cotton from the United States. By August 1940, half of the rubber specified in the contract had been delivered. The Rubber Reserve Company and the Financial Construction Company have close ties and have obtained a loan of US$140 million from the US government, with a contract to deliver 180,000 tons of rubber in the coming year, at a price of 17 to 20 cents per pound.

In terms of other sources, synthetic rubber is not a major factor because it is very expensive, at 65 cents per pound. Although when mass-produced, it could be supplied to the United States when needed at a price as low as 12 cents per pound. However, it is feared that it will be at least three years before production reaches this level.

In 1939, the United States consumed 170,000 tons of reclaimed rubber. According to experts, in the event of an accident, US rubber factories could produce 300,000 tons of reclaimed rubber.

At the same time, there is an extreme desire to encourage South American countries to increase rubber production. This goal could be achieved in about ten years, but the problem is that it requires large-scale US investment and the eradication of insect and disease damage to South American rubber trees.

Regarding rubber, we can draw the following conclusion. US reserves are very thin. According to a survey conducted in August 1940, US reserves at that time were only sufficient for four months of use. According to the most optimistic statistics, US rubber reserves, if imports were cut off, could last for one year. This statistic is entirely based on economics; at that time, unnecessary industries will reduce or eliminate rubber consumption, plus imports from the United Kingdom. The twelve-month period could very well allow the United States to research and convert to the use of synthetic rubber and import from South America.

At the same time, we must also consider increasing imports from the Dutch East Indies and the Federated Malay States. Regarding this issue, it depends on the attitude of the International Rubber Regulation Committee, which is largely controlled by the United Kingdom and determines how much rubber can be exported. In the past year, their policy has fully taken into account the interests of the United States, without being affected in the slightest. As a result, the quantity of rubber shipped to the United States has also been considerable and sufficient for consumption, and the price has also been set at a reasonable level.

Another conclusion is that the US rubber problem is very serious, but not insurmountable. Much depends on how rubber is transported once a problem arises, and whether the United States is preparing for this now. But another problem is that although the United Kingdom also controls a part, the source of rubber is largely supplied by Asia. Once there is international control, it will cause difficulties for the United States. Even Bolivia could supply a large amount of tin production at that time, but for various reasons, it can be seen that most of Bolivia's tin has always been purchased by the United Kingdom.

The United States has considered various methods to prevent a tin panic. At the same time, it has obtained the consent of the International Tin Committee to allow the United States to purchase 5,000 tons per year, and it is also worthwhile to discuss finding other markets for tin. However, how much tin the United States currently has in reserve is not well known to outsiders. However, in any case, if transportation problems were to arise sooner rather than later, although it would not be a fatal blow, the problem would always be there.

Japan's Fatal Wound

In conclusion, we can say that if US-Japan commercial relations are completely severed, especially if initiated by the United States or jointly promoted by the United Kingdom and the United States, it can be proven that Japan would suffer more severely than the United States. If Japan has the power to prevent US imports of rubber and tin, the United States will also be affected because imports of these two important commodities will inevitably be reduced. However, the United States would not be defeated, but the blow to Japan would be fatal.

This article is entirely based on economic issues. Although future developments will depend on the policies and strategies of the countries involved, much will depend on the policy that the United States adopts towards the Far East in the future, which will determine the final fate!

### Measures for the Bureau of Rice to Sell Rice at Stable Prices: A Preliminary Plan for a Certificate Purchase System

— Zhang Qiyu

The purpose of the proposed improvement to the Bureau of Rice's sales method in this article is to enable consumers who genuinely need rice to obtain the rice they need in the simplest way, with the least amount of manpower.

As far as I can see, it seems that a certificate purchase system can be implemented under the following principles: to discuss with the authorities and people from all walks of life.

(1) The purpose of implementing this system is to enable the bureau to reasonably distribute foreign rice, eliminate hoarding and manipulation, and reduce the threat of rice merchants in the market. (Note)

(2) Those who want to purchase publicly sold rice must first go through application procedures and purchase it with a certificate. The applicant for the certificate must fill out an application form with the nearest police station, Public Works Bureau, Shanghai Municipal Council, or designated rice shop or consumer cooperative based on their most recent month's housing tax ticket. The housing tax ticket will be kept for verification, and the person who receives the application form will give a duplicate receipt as proof.

(3) The application form must state: the number of rice-eating people in the entire house, the approximate amount of monthly income, the method, type, and weight of rice purchased in the two months before the application, the current address, and other important matters such as whether there is rice allowance from the organization or meals in the organization; the amount of rice requested to be purchased each month should also be carefully noted; if there is any rice already purchased and stored in the household, it should also be stated. The person in charge of the application must sign and seal the application form, or use a fingerprint instead; in order to receive the rice purchase certificate after receiving the approval notice, based on the duplicate receipt and the original seal. Regardless of whether it is approved or not, the housing tax ticket will also be returned based on the duplicate receipt.

(4) The issuance of rice purchase certificates will be handled by the review committee jointly formed by the two concession authorities, with an investigation team attached. The review procedures must be completed within seven days from the date of receipt of the application form.

(5) After receiving the application form, the investigation team will send uniformed personnel to investigate each household. When necessary, they may also investigate the service organization. If the investigator has any questions, the applicant should answer sincerely and shall not conceal or misrepresent the facts or engage in bribery.

(6) When the review committee issues rice purchase certificates, in addition to relying on the applicant's economic situation and the investigation report, it has the right to increase or decrease the amount applied for, and shall not exceed the following standards:

(A) For those aged 15 and above, 2.25 dou of rice per person per month.

(B) For those aged 10 to 15, 2 dou of rice per person per month.

(C) For those aged 5 to 10, 1 dou of rice per person per month. (Note)

(7) On the rice purchase certificate, the district should be noted according to the district method of the rice purchase certificate registration ledger; this certificate is only valid within the district for purchasing rice from the sales office. The certificate also has a number, and the applicant's name, gender, age, address, occupation and other items are listed in detail; regarding the approved rice quantity, it is listed in both Chinese and Arabic numerals, and the number of the rice purchase certificate is stamped with a prickly hard seal to prevent alteration.

(8) The effective expiry date of the rice purchase certificate should be uniform, such as the end of January, the end of April, the end of July, and the end of November. After the expiry date, a new application form must be filled out, and the review committee will reissue a new certificate based on the facts and investigation report.

(9) When the review committee issues the rice purchase certificates, it should register the rice purchase certificates in districts and compile a rice purchase certificate registration ledger, which will be stored in the bureau and issued to each rice store or consumer cooperative for reference.

(10) Any existing consumer cooperative or rice store in the city that is willing to sell and distribute bureau rice shall, after applying and being approved, be subject to the supervision of the bureau, and the bureau will give it a reasonable profit at the specified value.

(11) If the service provided by each sales office is indeed excellent and has made outstanding achievements, after investigation and verification, the bureau will reward it and announce its name to commend it.

(12) The bureau should uniformly issue each sales office with a specific style of seal for inspection; the bureau may charge for the cost of engraving this seal.

(13) Before selling bureau rice, each sales store should check the rice purchase certificate presented against the security ledger sent by the bureau to ensure that it matches, and then sell the rice within the limit: and fill in the date, quantity, and stamp the seal issued by the bureau on the rice purchase certificate; at the same time, a special ledger should be prepared to record the rice purchase certificate number, the quantity sold, the date, and the price. (Note)

(14) The holder of the rice purchase certificate may purchase rice from the sales office within the specified area at the fixed price within the monthly quota specified on the certificate, regardless of the number of times; however, the quantity of each purchase shall not be less than one sheng.

(15) The approved quantity for each month, regardless of whether it has been purchased in full, is only allowed to be purchased within the month and shall not be transferred or pre-purchased to other months.

(16) The rice purchase certificate shall not be used as a substitute; when necessary, the bureau may indicate on the certificate that it is limited to the responsible applicant's own use.

(17) In the event of changes in household registration such as death, moving out, moving in, and birth, which cause changes in the required amount of rice, the responsible applicant shall, if necessary, report the facts and refill out the application form to reissue a new certificate.

(18) The application procedures for organizations, groups, factories, businesses, schools, etc. to purchase rice shall be handled in the same way as ordinary households, unless otherwise specified. (Note)

(19) When restaurants, hotels, and food operators apply to purchase rice, the amount of rice required shall be estimated and certified by the trade association, and a statistical table of the amount of rice sold each month in the five months before the application shall be submitted; other regulations applicable to ordinary households. (Note)

(20) If the bureau finds that the applicant has falsely reported household registration or other fraudulent behavior, in addition to appropriately punishing the investigators, it may immediately revoke the applicant's rice purchase certificate and cancel it, and notify each sales office of the number of the rice purchase certificate at any time, so that it can be similarly canceled in the ledger. The applicant who has been canceled shall not be entitled to the benefit of applying again within three months from the date of cancellation. (Note)

(21) If a rice purchase certificate has not been used for more than two months, unless the original applicant can provide a legitimate reason in advance, the bureau will investigate and verify the facts and notify each sales office to cancel it; however, the responsible applicant may reapply.

(22) In addition to refusing to sell to those who falsely report household registration and fraudulently purchase rice, the police may also punish the responsible applicant according to the circumstances. (Note)

(23) Sales offices shall not refuse to sell bureau rice during normal business hours.

(24) If sales personnel or personnel handling rice purchase certificates are found to have engaged in bribery, they shall be severely punished according to law. The aforementioned personnel includes investigators. (Note)

(25) Regardless of whether it is a private individual or an organization, anyone who knows that an applicant is impersonating, intending to illegally profit, or is suspected of hoarding, and is not for actual consumption, may report to the nearest police station by name. The police station has an absolute obligation to keep such whistleblower information confidential. If it is true, they will be appropriately rewarded.

### A Tool for Cultivating Children: A Family Letter is Worth a Fortune

— Yi

Thinking of the upbringing of children, there are many fathers who live away in other cities, and therefore cannot fulfill the responsibility of teaching every day. At this time, family letters become a powerful tool for educating children.

Many fathers who are not good at words but have extremely high ideas can also use letters to teach their children. For many children who live in schools, writing family letters has become a very important task.

Many famous scholars in Chinese history have done their best to teach their children. Their educational goals are based on diligence, frugality, filial piety, etiquette, love of learning, and nobility. In the collection of family letters of famous people in history published by the Commercial Press, there are "Eating is not about fine meat, but about filling the stomach; clothing is not about colorful patterns, but about covering the body," "Yu did not love the inch of jade but loved the inch of time," "Filial piety, respect, benevolence, and righteousness are the most important of all virtues," "Leaving gold to your children is not as good as leaving them a classic," and other insightful sentences.

In Zhuge Liang's Admonition to His Son, there are sentences such as "The conduct of a gentleman is to cultivate himself with tranquility and nourish his virtue with frugality. Without indifference, there is no way to clarify his aspirations; without tranquility, there is no way to achieve far-reaching goals." In Shi Guifang's family letters, there are even words such as "Tao Kan transported tiles and claimed to practice labor, because there are things that are difficult to say to people directly. Labor gives rise to good intentions, and cultivating virtue and nurturing the body are all in it. Leisure gives rise to delusions, and losing virtue and harming the body are all in it." Such words and deeds, even in modern times, will not lose their value.

In the United States, there is also the book Twenty Family Letters. It was written by a wealthy food merchant to his son and compiled by the chief writer of the Saturday Evening Post. It also contains many profound sayings. For example, regarding education, he said: "When education is around you, you should try your best to seize it. You will find that education is something scattered all over the world, and everyone can acquire it endlessly." He also said: "The greatest purpose of education is to create a beautiful character, and then knowledge." The whole book is full of humorous and insightful words, and has become a good book loved by everyone in American families.

In a small town in the United States, there is a family because all the boys are away in other cities, their mother collects the family letters received from all over the country, edits them, types them into several copies, and sends them to each son living in other cities. This is also a method worth adopting.

My Family Problems

### Announcement of the Essay Contest, Seventh: A Cold-Hearted Father

— Fei Xia

From the time I started to have memories until now, I have almost never seen my father smile. This is a strange and inappropriate thing between us, father and daughter.

The economic situation in my family is not very difficult. My father works in a certain government office and has a considerable monthly income, so it is not very difficult to support a family of six. Therefore, what makes my father cold-hearted is definitely not an economic problem, but a habit, a habit of elders wanting to maintain authority over younger generations.

Every morning, my father sits solemnly on the sofa with a沉着face, reading the newspaper from the first page to the last, as if he wants to swallow it. Rarely, he might pace around the room. At this time, we - his children - must "sit upright" and wait for breakfast, otherwise we will be condemned by him. After breakfast, it is our world, and we fly to school.

Similarly, at lunch or dinner, we can see a stern father sitting at the head of the table.

Sometimes when my siblings and I are talking and laughing, my father suddenly appears, and the air suddenly becomes tense. The conversation stops, and the ignorant younger siblings slip out one by one. Only my parents and I remain in the room. I often feel sad for this situation, and at the same time, I feel sad for my father. How can the feelings between our two generations be so bad?

Not only that, but my father is also very stiff with my mother. There is no conversation or discussion between them, and "cooperation" is never possible when there is something going on in the family.

But strangely enough, my father and mother have never quarreled.

The separation between my father and us is deepening. I am concerned about this point, so I try my best to eliminate it while it is still possible to eliminate it.

Once, I finally mustered up the courage to walk up to my father, who was reading the newspaper, and stammered:

"Dad! I want...we..."

"Hmm!" My father raised his head and said with some weariness.

I suddenly felt very uncomfortable, and I couldn't say anything anymore. My courage was driven away by my father's coldness.

I began to worry about my younger siblings and myself. All the teenagers in the world have a sweet home, but we four can't enjoy it at all. When I saw the背影, I couldn't help but shed tears. I even envied the poor families as long as their parents are gentle. Not having my father's love will become the regret of my life. (A fee of ten yuan will be given to the Family Monthly for twelve issues throughout the year.)

Editor's note: The situation that Ms. Fei Xia has suffered is common in Chinese families. In fact, isn't it the same in foreign countries? In "Gu Yuan", isn't the father in the Barrett family just as cold-hearted? Many fathers put on a cold attitude in order to maintain their dignity, but perhaps they have troubles in their work, so when they get home, they can't show a kind and pleasant appearance. I hope these fathers don't keep their troubles to themselves. Sometimes talking with their children can eliminate troubles and at the same time enjoy the fun of family. As for the children, like Ms. Fei Xia, don't worry too much. If possible, you can try to make your father feel at peace and happy. Family happiness requires everyone to work together to seek and create. Next issue of the essay contest announcement: A wife in the countryside.

### A Family Awaiting Aid

To the esteemed editor of the Shenbao Family section,

I originally had a family of above-average means, but six years ago, my husband suddenly lost his job due to a drastic reduction in salary. He resigned rather than accept it. Over these six years, the cost of living has risen daily, making it difficult to sustain our family. He subsequently developed a stomach ailment and passed away this spring, leaving behind three children. Our close relatives are as distant as ice and charcoal, and several requests for assistance have gone unanswered. At a time when prices are soaring, how can I, a weak and incapable woman, support four lives? I earnestly request that you, sir, guide me to a path to save our four lives. Your merit would be immeasurable.

Respectfully submitted,
Yu Hua

Ms. Jinhua:

In your letter, you did not mention the ages of your children, whether they are young or attending school. Are you able to do any work yourself to generate some income to support your family's expenses? What is your current financial situation? We hope you can provide us with a detailed account of your family's circumstances so that we can publish your situation in this newspaper. Perhaps among our readers, there are those who would be willing to help you.

### A Week's Home-Style Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Snow pea sprouts are now on the market again. Among vegetables, they can be considered a delicacy because they are often combined with shrimp. Any banquet often includes stir-fried snow pea sprouts with shrimp. Before snow pea sprouts are available, green peas serve as a substitute, but once snow pea sprouts appear, they replace green peas. The price of shrimp has recently become prohibitively expensive, so stir-fried snow pea sprouts with shrimp is a rare sight on the tables of economical families. While large shrimp are too expensive, small shrimp can still be enjoyed. Once shelled, they can be stir-fried with snow pea sprouts. If shrimp is not used, stir-fried snow pea sprouts with shredded pork are also delicious. If there are vegetarian elderly in the family, you can also have plain stir-fried snow pea sprouts. However, like alfalfa, it requires a generous amount of oil.

### (145) Plain Stir-fried Shrimp and Crab

— Draft by Hu Hengfu

Ingredients: Crab, shrimp, lard, pure white water chestnut flour, Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence, cooking wine, scallions, ginger

Preparation: First, boil the crab until cooked, then extract the crab meat. Next, peel the shrimp and remove the shrimp meat. Heat lard in a wok until it boils. Immediately add the crab meat and shrimp meat together and stir-fry briefly. Then add an appropriate amount of soy sauce, cooking wine, soy sauce essence, water chestnut flour slurry, scallion pieces, and ginger mince. Continue to stir-fry until the seasoning is balanced, then remove from the heat. The stir-frying must be done skillfully, otherwise the shrimp meat will become overcooked and lose its freshness. This dish truly combines two delicacies. Crab alone is already fresh and fatty, but adding shrimp meat is the icing on the cake.

Spring and Autumn

### Eradicate the City's Greatest Enemy - Tuberculosis

— Wuwei

In Madam Hardoon, Luo Jialing's announcement, we see the words "...diagnosed with tuberculosis on August 1st, already in the third stage, urgently needing air injections..." Even for such a wealthy widow possessing assets of tens of millions, living in the vast Aili Garden and enjoying a heavenly life, she is still a victim of tuberculosis. It goes without saying that others are even more vulnerable.

This great enemy of the city is indeed rampant and chilling. According to statistics, out of Shanghai's four million population, at least 320,000 people suffer from this terrible disease. However, the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association has risen to challenge it, vowing to eradicate this scourge with its utmost efforts. We thank these enthusiastic individuals who have sounded the alarm, urging everyone to mobilize and eliminate this tuberculosis demon!

Rather than saying we are working and donating money for others, frankly, we are doing it for ourselves. To protect our own health, we must first eliminate the disease demons lurking around us, preying on people. It's like fighting a fire. If the flames in neighboring houses are not put out, can you guarantee that your own house will not be affected?

Eradicating tuberculosis in the city is everyone's responsibility. The members of the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association, undeterred by difficulties, have taken the lead. All citizens should unite to support them so that their fundraising goal of one million yuan can be achieved as soon as possible. We also hope that this tuberculosis prevention work can be extended from Shanghai, the only major city, to cities across the country. Let everyone be aware of the terror of this "white terror" and seek permanent liberation from the shackles of this debilitating disease.

### How Infants and Toddlers Should Avoid Tuberculosis Reducing Contact With Patients Reduces the Chance of Infection

— Diqing

Tuberculosis is not something one is born with. This can give mothers a comforting belief: tuberculosis is not hereditary. It can be said to be an infectious disease. These germs are invisible to the naked eye and are often transmitted by adults caring for children.

The most important thing is to prevent children from being infected with bacteria. Prevent anyone suffering from tuberculosis from transmitting bacteria to children through their oral breathing, saliva, or bacteria left on teacups, towels, or food.

Anyone suffering from tuberculosis, whether father, mother, relative, caregiver, or other acquaintance, poses a risk as long as they have close contact with the child. Children should be kept away from these people to reduce the chance of infection.

A difficult question arises. What if the child's mother has tuberculosis? Mothers should sacrifice some of their natural love for their children to prevent them from being infected with tuberculosis. Separating the child from the mother may not be easy in practice. Then, the mother must pay attention to her every move, being careful to prevent bacteria from being transmitted to the child's mouth through saliva, coughing, or using towels. The danger does not lie in breastfeeding, but in breathing, coughing, and touching.

Cow's milk and mother's milk can both carry bacteria, so only milk that has been tested for tuberculosis or sterilized milk should be used. Otherwise, it should be boiled before being fed to the child.

After making various efforts to protect the child from infection, attention should also be paid to cultivating the child's natural resistance. There are several simple methods that must be diligently followed:

Ventilation: In the first few months of a baby's life, the baby should be kept in a well-ventilated area. When he sleeps in the cradle, his face should always be exposed to air circulation, and his arms should be able to move freely, which can help the baby's lungs expand. The windows in the room should be kept open. Fresh, clean air is essential.

Skin: Some mothers seem to think that all that is needed for a child's skin is to wash it regularly and apply powder. In fact, there are other things to consider besides cleanliness, because the skin has other functions besides covering the body. In temperate weather, children's skin should be exposed to the air and sunlight as much as possible. (To be continued)

Fourteen: The Life of Beating Up Heroes

Unfortunately, the stage was too large, and his own age and physique were truly not suitable for such strenuous effort. He barely managed to tumble to the edge of the stage when a bout of dizziness caused him to fall on the carpet. Needless to say, the audience responded with a chorus of boos, mixed with many extremely unpleasant jeers. If it weren't for the makeup on his face, he might not have had the courage to get up from the ground again.

Because the purpose of making fun of him had been achieved, and his "true talents and skills" had been clearly demonstrated, the martial arts performers on stage and Zhang Yincai himself all made faces at him. When sparring with weapons, his back and legs were poked forcefully at least dozens of times.

Sweat poured down like summer rain. When Begonia removed his makeup, he was almost completely soaked.

"Old Wang, look how pitiful that newcomer is. After you guys messed with him today, see, the tears on his face haven't even dried yet!" A clown actor sitting on a trunk said quietly to a martial arts performer standing next to him.

The martial arts performer just chuckled drily.

Begonia found it very strange when he heard this. He remembered that he had not cried. His face should be all sweat. How could people mistake it for tears? As he thought this, he secretly raised his hand and touched his eye sockets. Unexpectedly, his eyelashes were indeed wet. He truly couldn't tell whether it was sweat or tears! (264)
