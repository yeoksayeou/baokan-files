### Chiang Kai-shek's Political Advisor, Lattimore, Arrives in Chongqing from Hong Kong, Immediately Meets with Chiang to Present Letter from President Roosevelt, All Future Work Will Be Subject to Chiang Kai-shek's Orders

Chongqing – Owen Lattimore, political advisor to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, arrived in Chongqing at 5:20 AM on the 19th, flying from Hong Kong on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane. Generalissimo Chiang, along with Secretary-General Jiang Tingfu, representing Vice President Kung, and Directors He Yaozu and Shang Zhen, were present at the airport to welcome him. Upon disembarking, Lattimore greeted the officials in fluent Mandarin Chinese and engaged in free conversation. Lattimore is of medium build, with thinning hair, wearing glasses, a Mongolian silver ring, a Western suit made of hemp fabric, and a blue shirt, displaying the demeanor of a scholar, albeit slightly travel-worn. While walking to the reception room, Lattimore looked around and remarked on the beautiful scenery. Upon entering the reception room, when questioned by Chinese and foreign reporters about his impressions, Lattimore first stated that since China's resistance against Japan, this was his first opportunity to visit Chongqing, the center of the resistance, which he found deeply gratifying. He expressed his strong sympathy for China's resistance and stated that he was here to serve Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of China's fight for freedom. His future work would be assigned by Generalissimo Chiang, and he would follow his orders in all matters. When asked if he carried a letter from President Roosevelt, Lattimore smiled and said that as long as Japan remained bogged down in its invasion of China, there would be no end to cabinet collapses in Japan. When asked about recent American sentiment towards Japan, Lattimore replied that American antipathy towards Japan was growing stronger. At 6:00 AM, he was escorted across the river by Secretary-General Jiang and others. Lattimore, having spent most of the past two weeks sitting on planes, refrained from walking much and ascended the steps slowly. It is said that Lattimore met with Generalissimo Chiang that day. Whether he will reside in Chongqing for an extended period or travel to various locations, Lattimore said he would follow Generalissimo Chiang's orders in all matters. (19th Dispatch)

Chongqing – Owen Lattimore, the newly appointed American political advisor to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, declared upon arriving here today that Japan's cabinet crisis is not really a "China crisis." Lattimore said that as long as Japan fails to succeed in China, these crises will inevitably continue to occur. Lattimore arrived here from Hong Kong by plane at dawn. He told the press that he was pleased to be here and to serve under Generalissimo Chiang. He also said, "Since China began its resistance, I have expressed great sympathy for China, and therefore I am delighted to be in the center of China's resistance and to serve under the leader who is obtaining freedom for China. I am not yet aware of the exact nature and scope of my responsibilities; I am completely subject to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's orders." Lattimore carried personal letters from President Roosevelt and other American leaders to Generalissimo Chiang. Although Lattimore traveled extensively in China as a young man, today marked his first visit to Chongqing. He met with Generalissimo Chiang for the first time at a tea party today and presented the letters he brought from the United States to the Generalissimo. The *Shishi Xinbao* welcomed Lattimore today but expressed dissatisfaction with Lattimore's book on the frontier, which stated that China's northern frontier was inhabited by several different ethnic groups.

### Actions of the Eighteenth Group Army Not Taken Seriously by Authorities, Believe No Serious Developments Possible, Government Will Not Punish the Communists

Chongqing – The official Central News Agency revealed today that since June 22, the Communist Party's Eighteenth Group Army has repeatedly attacked the Central Army in various locations. This news was released today as Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's newly appointed American political advisor, Owen Lattimore, arrived here. The Military Affairs Commission immediately stopped these attacks and ordered the Communist troops to withdraw to their original defense zones, but no reply has yet been received from Zhu De. The Central News Agency detailed military reports of the Communist army's unauthorized actions in southeastern Shanxi and western and northern Shandong. This is the first time news of these conflicts has been released, and neither the Nationalists nor the Communists deny them. The Central News Agency claimed that on June 22, 2,000 Communist troops in northern Shandong attacked the flank of a Central Government guerrilla unit engaged in a night raid on Japanese forces. On July 8, another conflict occurred in western Shandong, resulting in 50 casualties for the Central Army. On the same day, in southeastern Shanxi, a Communist suicide squad disarmed a regiment of the Central Army. On July 12, conflicts broke out again in southern and central Shanxi, and the Communist Party kidnapped a county magistrate. It is reported that authoritative sources have decided to take necessary measures to maintain strict discipline within the Communist Party, but this source denies that the government plans military action against the Communists at this time. They said that senior Central Military authorities have stated that the Communist parties of other democratic countries all assist their governments when fighting foreign enemies, but the Chinese Communist Party often thinks of ambushing its compatriots. The same source stated that senior Chinese military authorities expressed regret that the Communist Party has repeatedly attacked the Central Army since the New Fourth Army was disbanded by the Central Army. (19th United Press)

Chongqing – A government spokesperson recently strongly stated that the government would not take punitive action against the Communist Party and that the reports circulating here of the Eighteenth Route Army attacking the Central Army were insignificant. The spokesperson strongly denied the Central News Agency's reports that there would be serious developments in the future, and criticized the exaggeration of this news by various parties as confusing. They stated that the small conflicts that had occurred in the past had not had serious consequences, so how could today's events have serious consequences? (19th United Press)

### Large Numbers of Japanese Troops Reportedly Withdrawing from Shanxi, Concentrating West of Beiping, Seemingly Moving Northward, Strengthening Forces in Inner Mongolia in Preparation Against the Soviet Union

There are an unusually large number of Japanese soldiers at stations west of Beiping, making the northward movement more credible. There have been no reports of battles in the Mengjiang area recently. The area has been relatively quiet for several months, so news of Japanese troop movements suggests that the Japanese plan to strengthen forces near Mongolia in order to confront the Soviet Union. The morning express train from Beiping to (transliteration) has been suspended for two days. The reason has not been announced, but it is widely believed to be due to military needs. (19th Dispatch)

### Britain Mediates, Soviet Union and Poland Reach Compromise, United Front Fights Against Nazis, Britain, Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia Exchange Diplomatic Envoys

Reuters, London, 19th – Polish Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief General Sikorski, speaking at a ceremony held by the Polish Air Force, emphasized the importance of Polish-Soviet negotiations, saying that he strongly agreed with Churchill's view that a Polish-Soviet treaty was important and urgent. As for Germany, he resolutely rejected, in the name of the Polish government, the kindness that Hitler's cruel executioners were now trying to feign to us, and I also had the will and desire of the whole country as a backing, openly announcing that there could be no compromise with Hitlerism. Although the Soviet Union had acted erroneously towards Poland, and although there had been disputes between Poland and the Soviet Union for 150 years, he still hoped for an understanding with the Soviet Union, but this compromise must be real and not undermine Polish borders and sovereignty, lest it call into question the sincerity of the Allied effort.

Editorial

### Where is Japan Going?

Following the sudden cabinet collapse in Japan, the third Konoe cabinet was hastily formed the day before yesterday. The biggest changes in the cabinet lineup are two: first, Matsuoka was removed from his post, and Toyoda Teijirō, the former Minister of Commerce and Industry and a naval figure, succeeded him as Foreign Minister; second, the post of Finance Minister was taken over by Ogura Masatsune, the so-called giant of the business world. On the whole, although the new cabinet has added another vice admiral (Minister of Commerce and Industry Sakonji) and a vice admiral of the medical corps (Minister of Health and Welfare Koizumi), thus further strengthening the atmosphere of a military cabinet, because Ogura is a well-known pro-British and American tycoon and the current chairman of the U.S.-Japan Society and the Anglo-Japanese Society, and Toyoda is also known for his prudence and has served as a counselor at the British Embassy and attended the London Naval Conference, and is also a good friend of the current Ambassador to the United States Nomura, so in general, the new cabinet seems to be more inclined towards stability and has not completely fallen into the hands of the so-called extremists as outsiders have imagined in recent days.

According to the communiqué issued by the new Japanese cabinet, it will promote an "independent and autonomous diplomatic policy" in the future and state that the "national policy" decided at the Imperial Conference on July 2 remains unchanged. As for the Army and Navy ministries, they issued a joint statement urging the entire country to unite closely and "rapidly strengthen the wartime organization," while the new Minister of Finance Ogura, who is responsible for leading the so-called economic war, said that "the government is taking practical control measures so that it can establish a highly national defense based on the original foundation." Summarizing these fragments, it can be generally assumed that this third Konoe cabinet will no longer invoke abstract names like "new system" in the future. In internal affairs, it will at least rely on the help of the business world and the financial groups to implement the so-called new economic program in order to increase war production. In diplomacy, it will fundamentally overturn the Matsuoka line in order to obtain greater freedom of action in the future.

Regarding what new tricks the new Konoe cabinet will play in internal affairs in the future, based on the past experience of the "unsuccessful" New System Movement, we feel that there is no need to rush to discuss it. What is more noteworthy is Japan's external dynamics. The "slap in the face" of Matsuoka diplomacy has long been obvious, so it is no wonder that a certain Japanese newspaper urgently said: "We need a foreign minister with eyes that can see at least one year ahead." Although what Toyoda said about "independent and autonomous diplomacy" is originally a familiar cliché in the mouths of the Japanese authorities, what is noteworthy is his annotation to this diplomatic policy. He said: Japanese diplomacy must be suitable for the daily international situation. In other words, Japanese diplomacy must follow the development of the daily situation in the future and not be bound by treaty obligations. In other words, if the Soviet Union cannot resist the Nazi offensive and retreats repeatedly, Japan may as well ignore the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact and brazenly advance north. Conversely, if the German invasion of the Soviet Union finally encounters setbacks, Japan may as well abolish the Tripartite Pact and withdraw from the Axis! It can be seen from this that the so-called independent and autonomous diplomacy of the new Japanese cabinet contains full fluidity. It has kicked over the self-made fence of Matsuoka diplomacy with one foot, so that when the situation permits, it can immediately implement one of the many plans set at the Imperial Conference.

The diplomatic significance of this cabinet reshuffle in Japan lies in obtaining greater freedom of action. Although as mentioned above, it cannot be so simple in actual action. In short, although the Tokyo authorities are now preparing to move from the stage of "quiet observation" to the stage of "action," before launching it, they will inevitably use some residual appeasement toxins in the Minzhi country to make a final bargaining. Toyoda and Ogura's respective appointments as foreign and financial ministers may be somewhat facilitating the implementation of this activity. However, judging from the White House's convocation of naval leaders yesterday to discuss the Far East situation, as well as British Ambassador to the United States Halifax's clear speech, it can be seen that the British and American authorities will not relax their grip on the safety of the Far East, nor will they allow Japan to fish in troubled waters. Regarding this point, Halifax said very clearly: "Although both Britain and the United States are unwilling to go to war with Japan, Japan must respect the interests of other countries on the Far East issue. It would be a big mistake for anyone to think that Britain, because it is under the pressure of the European war, must or have to allow other countries to disregard its interests in other parts of the world." This is tantamount to a warning to the new Japanese foreign minister.

### Britain Pays Attention to the Far East Situation, Appoints Governor of Singapore, No New Developments Seen in Japanese-Vietnamese Relations

United Press, London, 19th – According to reliable sources, Prime Minister Churchill has appointed Duff Cooper as Governor of Singapore. This appointment will be of the same nature as that of the Middle East Governor-General in Cairo, which has a higher office. Observers believe that the appointment of Duff Cooper is clear evidence of Prime Minister Churchill's attention to the Far East situation. At the same time, it is rumored here that Hitler has made a request to Japan, urging Japan to immediately attack Siberia when the German army wins on the Soviet Western Front.

United Press, Singapore, 19th – The Royal Air Force's elite reinforcement personnel and other special detachments, as well as ten members of the Royal Navy's "Wrens" Auxiliary Corps, arrived here today from Britain. Although everyone had traveled a long distance, they were in excellent health and spirits. British Far East Commander-in-Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham also personally welcomed them. According to the newcomers, nothing happened along the way, so although there were many emergency alarms, the escorting warships left the convoy soon after they set off from Britain. It is said that they went to participate in the search for the German battleship Bismarck. When the transport ship stopped at a port in West Africa, it was attacked by a Heinkel bomber with machine guns, but no damage occurred.

Reuters, Singapore, 19th – There is still skepticism here about whether Japan will take action against Vietnam or the Soviet Union. The formation of the new Japanese cabinet has neither reassured people nor aroused new worries. An authoritative source said that we are no longer moved by the Japanese side's remarks, or the comings and goings of its politicians, or its unusually urgent announcements. We are prepared for any development and have nothing else to say. It is generally believed here that if Japan has any demands on Vietnam, its pressure will be applied directly to Vichy, rather than to the intercepting authorities. Japan used this procedure to pressure Vichy when the Thai-Vietnamese armistice terms were negotiated earlier this year.

Reuters, Batavia, 19th – The *Batavia Nieuwsblad* discussed the rumors that Japan intends to seize or lease the Cam Ranh Bay naval base and the air force base in the Saigon area, saying that those responsible for Tokyo's foreign policy should think again and not hastily adopt the plan proposed by the military to place the entire Vietnam under Japanese influence. The weak resistance that the French side can offer is not worth considering, but the attitudes of Britain and the United States must be taken into account. Last year, when the Japanese army entered Tokyo, Britain and the United States took a purely passive attitude, but the political and military situation in the Pacific has now changed greatly, and the ABCD front has now become a truly important factor. Japan should know the dangers it faces in its southward advance. Moreover, if the Japanese side exerts too much pressure, how can it be known that Vietnam will not change its attitude towards Vichy? Most of the French in Vietnam are pro-British, especially in the south. This is an open secret. There is one thing that the French in Vietnam all agree on, and that is their hatred of Japan.

Reuters, Saigon, 19th – The Governor-General of Vietnam and his entourage have returned after a short inspection of Tonkin and Cambodia. There have been no new developments in the relations between Vietnam and Japan. Officials still say that they do not know of any new negotiations with the Japanese side. The first group of members of the Japanese delegation to the Border Demarcation Committee, led by Yano, the former Ambassador to Spain, is scheduled to arrive here today, while Colonel Masafumi Kusamizu, the representative of the Japanese Mission in Saigon, has flown to Haiphong, presumably to discuss everything with General Shigetomi, the leader of the mission. Shigetomi previously flew to Tokyo and will now return here. According to sources in Hanoi, Japanese-Vietnamese relations are currently very friendly. The commander of the Japanese army stationed in Tonkin, Vietnam, was formerly Nishimura, but has now been replaced by Yamagata, so the two sides are becoming more and more harmonious.

### U.S. Considering Steps to Expand Export Controls, Japan, Spain, Portugal, and Sweden to be Added to Blacklist, Preventing Trade with Axis Countries

Reuters, Washington, 19th - The State Department announced yesterday that it plans to add countries outside the Western Hemisphere, such as Japan, Spain, Portugal, and Sweden, to the blacklist, treating them the same as businesses and individuals aiding Germany and Italy, and prohibiting Americans from trading with them. However, the date of the blacklist's publication has not yet been determined.

Reuters, Washington, 19th - Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the United States is currently considering various possible steps to expand export controls to regions outside of Latin America.

United Press, Washington, 19th - President Roosevelt stated that the Latin American blacklist is fluid and can be increased or decreased at will. Observers believe that President Roosevelt is betting on the cooperation of other American countries with the blacklist through his "Good Neighbor" policy. The list, announced on Thursday, includes 1,800 businesses in Central and South America. According to other State Department officials, expanding the scope of the blacklist will prohibit Americans from trading with German and Italian businesses in Japan.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 19th - A German government spokesman said yesterday that the German government has taken note of President Roosevelt's threat to include South American businesses engaged in trade relations with Axis countries on a "blacklist." The spokesman stated that this measure taken by Roosevelt only applies to belligerent nations, and it is clear that Roosevelt is waging a commercial war against Germany. The spokesman declined to comment on what retaliatory measures Germany would take.

### U.S. Expands Base, Japan Extremely Anxious, "Tokyo Times" Urges Breaking the Encirclement

Reuters, Tokyo, 19th - The "Tokyo Times" commented on the U.S. designating Midway Island, Johnston Island, and Palmyra Island in the Pacific as American military outposts, stating that this development shows the U.S. intends to control Japan's access routes. The expansion of important bases in the central Pacific by the U.S. will allow its borders to penetrate into neutral areas. If the U.S. obtains air force bases in Asia, as has been rumored recently, and forms a pincer movement with the Philippine bases, this chain of actions will become a major issue of international encroachment worthy of international protest. The U.S.'s westward expansion is currently causing anxiety in Japan. Once the U.S.'s Far East sea, land, and air bases are connected to British and Australian bases, the encirclement that endangers international peace will become a serious event. Japan should take strong action now, before this encirclement becomes strong and dangerous, to protect its own interests.

United Press, Tokyo, 19th - The "Japan Guangzhi News" stated that the U.S.'s expansion of bases in the Pacific and Atlantic is nominally defensive but is, in reality, an act of imperialism, and this has been a consistent policy of the Washington government since Roosevelt took office. It also stated that when the Anglo-American joint defense in the Pacific is completed, Japan will be encircled. This issue, which is sufficient to endanger international peace, has reached a critical juncture.

United Press, Washington, 19th - Rear Admiral Ross, Director of the Naval Medical Department, revealed yesterday that the U.S. has redeployed personnel to Guam. He also stated that the Congressional Naval Committee has been requested to allocate $100,000 to build a hospital on Guam, which is necessary after the redeployment of personnel to Guam.

### Broad Transfers Expected in Japanese Foreign Ministry, Ohas hi and Honda Resign

Reuters, Tokyo, 19th - Vice Minister Ohas hi has submitted his resignation to the Foreign Minister, and it seems certain to be approved. It is rumored that former Ambassador to Vichy, Renzo Sawada, may succeed him in this position. At the same time, officials expect that there will be broad transfers of important personnel in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Ohas hi is considered a strong advocate for the Axis powers.

Chongqing, 19th - Allied News Agency broadcast from Tokyo on the 19th, reporting that Shirotori, the former Ambassador to Italy and current advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and several current ambassadors and ministers to foreign countries, will resign their positions in the near future.

Reuters, Tokyo, 19th - Honda returned here from Kyoto this morning and immediately submitted his resignation to the new Foreign Minister.

Reuters, Tokyo, 19th - After Konoe's re-formation of the cabinet, Vice President Yanagawa of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, Director-General Ishiwara, and Chairman Sueyoshi of the Central Cooperation Committee of the association will all continue to hold their positions. Furthermore, Vice Minister Uyeda of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Director-General Yamazaki of the Kyoto Police Department, and Chief Hashimoto of the Police Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs will also withdraw their resignations and continue to serve.

### U.S. Judge Murphy Turns Over Important Position

United Press, Washington, 19th - Former U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Judge Murphy, had lunch with President Roosevelt yesterday. It is widely rumored that he will soon assume an important position in Far Eastern affairs. It is believed that President Roosevelt and Murphy discussed the Far Eastern situation, as the changes in the Japanese cabinet have made the Far Eastern situation even more noteworthy. Although Murphy is very pleased with his current position as a judge on the Supreme Court, it is reported that he is often consulted by the President on Far Eastern affairs, leading people to believe that he will soon take up an important position in Washington or the Philippines.

### Konoe and Toyoda Declare No Change in Japanese National Policy, But Will Adopt Independent Diplomatic Views to Cope with Tense International Situation

Entire Press, Tokyo, 19th - The leaders of the new Japanese cabinet declared last night that the government will act in accordance with the policies decided upon at the recent Imperial Conference, but solemnly stated that the nation will pursue an autonomous and independent foreign policy. The Imperial Conference was convened on July 2nd, and the policies decided at that time have not been thoroughly explained. However, since then, Japanese newspapers have published official notices solemnly indicating an independent and autonomous foreign policy. This is coincidentally related to the newspapers' gradually decreasing mention of the Tripartite Pact and the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty. Thus far, the statements of the new cabinet members have not mentioned a single word about the Tripartite Pact or the Neutrality Treaty. The Navy and Army ministries issued a joint statement urging the nation to unite and quickly strengthen the wartime structure. The statement said: "The main provisions of the government's policies, which were decided at the previous Imperial Conference, are not affected by the cabinet changes." The Navy and Army ministries stated that the new cabinet has the characteristics of a wartime cabinet, and also stated that government agencies should work together to implement military and political work. Foreign Minister Toyoda said, "I have assumed the position of Foreign Minister with the determination to fulfill the duties of a soldier. When the Tripartite Pact was signed, I was the Vice Minister of the Navy and I was well aware of the diplomatic situation at the time. However, I am still not familiar with the diplomatic events of the past three months, and I will do my best to study them in the future." He also said, "Undoubtedly, Japan's original national policy will remain unchanged, but I think it is necessary to adopt independent views so that we can adapt to the international situation every day. In any case, I have decided to fulfill my responsibilities, and I have now been appointed Foreign Minister." Konoe's statement said, "As a result of the rapid changes in the world situation, our country's mission is gradually becoming more important. The whole country should unite closely. This is really the time. I am very apprehensive that I am already competent, but I am willing to do my best to live up to the great expectations of the Emperor. Our country's policy for dealing with the international situation has already been formulated. All that is needed is for us to resolutely implement it. I firmly believe that the only way to realize national policy is to place domestic affairs on the basis of national policy. I am willing to do everything within my power, with the support of the 100 million Japanese people, to overcome all kinds of difficulties and complete the great cause of building the Empire." Ogura, who continues to serve as the Minister of Finance, said, "International relations have gradually become complicated, and it is unknown whether they will worsen in the future." He also said, "The government is taking practical control measures so that it can establish a national defense state based on the original foundation." Ogura is the chairman of the U.S.-Japan Association and the British-Japan Association, and Murata, the post-minister, is the vice chairman of the U.S.-Japan Association.

### Matsuoka's Gloomy Expression, Says He Will Devote Himself to Reading, Went to Japanese Foreign Ministry Yesterday to Hand Over

United Press, Tokyo, 19th - The Japan News Agency announced that Matsuoka Yosuke visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the first time today since claiming to be ill, to hand over his affairs. Matsuoka's face was pale and he seemed to still be suffering from a high fever. He told the press, "I have now been relieved of my responsibilities, and I will devote myself to reading from now on." After making this statement, Matsuoka wrote two poems to express his aspirations. He then said, "I no longer need to take on any further duties, and I have no intention of taking on any more. But if Japan faces a serious crisis, I will decide to deal with any difficulties." When someone asked Matsuoka about Toyoda, Matsuoka replied that he had absolute confidence in Toyoda's appointment as Foreign Minister. A Japanese newspaper reporter said that after Matsuoka and Toyoda had a confidential talk for forty-five minutes, when Matsuoka took his leave, one of the officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shouted "Banzai for Matsuoka!"

### Second Meeting of the New Cabinet Scheduled for the Day After Tomorrow

Reuters, Tokyo, 19th - After holding its second meeting for eighteen minutes, the new cabinet released a statement in which Konoe declared his determination to strengthen the new system and implement the government's established policies in a bold and rapid manner in order to cope with the increasingly serious world situation. Minister of the Army Tojo and Minister of the Navy Oikawa also jointly released a statement expressing their support for the new cabinet and declaring that the nation's basic policies would not change. The second cabinet meeting is scheduled to be held on July 22nd. The politicians in the new cabinet who advocate moderation hold key positions. The most notable change is the dismissal of former Foreign Minister Matsuoka. Former Prime Minister Hiranuma, who was previously brought into the cabinet by Konoe to assist him and confront the radicals, is now a minister without portfolio in the new cabinet. It is believed that Hiranuma is the leader of those who oppose any rash diplomatic actions. As a member of the cabinet without portfolio, his power should be strengthened. The fact that Minister of the Army Tojo and Minister of the Navy Oikawa have remained in their positions may indicate that, at least for the time being, the military and the Prime Minister are getting along well. The new Minister of Finance, Ogura, was a member of the previous cabinet without portfolio and is the leader of the Sumitomo Corporation. Sumitomo is one of Japan's five largest merchants. Although there are naval and army figures in the new cabinet, the general tone gives people the impression of political moderation. Konoe has apparently abandoned his policy of bringing in representatives from all factions and advocated selecting cabinet members with like-minded political views. Hiranuma's remaining in the cabinet may indicate a nationalistic trend. Hiranuma previously resigned his position as Prime Minister because of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty. Rather than saying that Hiranuma leans towards the Axis powers or towards Britain and the United States, it is better to say that he leans towards his own country. Japanese public opinion has not yet formed a concrete expression of the political color of the new cabinet, but Toyoda's appointment as Foreign Minister is widely welcomed. Semi-official sources say that Japan's diplomatic policy will not change as a result of this. Japan's unchanging policy is still based on resolving the war against China. It is said that Toyoda was previously stationed in London as a naval attache and was a speaker for the Japanese delegation to the 1935 London Naval Conference. He speaks fluent English and is a relative of the Mitsui tycoon. It is rumored that he once advised the Japanese authorities to take a calm attitude towards the United States' fortification of Guam.

### Spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Comments on the Japanese Political Situation

Chongqing, 19th - The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made an incisive critique of the recent changes in the Japanese political situation at a regular meeting with Chinese and foreign reporters on the morning of the 19th and reported on the new measures taken by the Ministry to adjust the embassies and consulates in Europe. The spokesperson first stated that the collapse of the Konoe cabinet, including the partial reorganizations of its first and second cabinets, has occurred eight times in total. The collapse of the cabinet this time was caused by the urgency of the economic crisis and political chaos after four years of invading China. However, judging from Matsuoka's pre-submission of his resignation and the fact that only Matsuoka among the four ministers of the Army, Navy, Foreign Affairs, and Home Affairs was not re-elected, and was replaced by Toyoda, a hardliner in the Navy, it can be seen that its significance is even greater in terms of foreign relations than in terms of domestic affairs. The spokesperson continued, "Although there is still not enough information at present, judging from the general trend, the significance of Konoe's reorganization of the cabinet this time can be said to be the Japanese version of the Hess incident. Hitler used Hess's defection to launch a peace offensive against Britain on the one hand, and to relax the vigilance of Britain and the Soviet Union by weakening the anti-Soviet faction at home. As a result, he continued to wage war against Britain, but suddenly turned around and launched a blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union. Now Japan is still sending Konoe out, instead of having radical figures come forward. The meaning is the same. The only difference is that Hess was captured by the British, while Konoe has become a prisoner of the Japanese chaebol." The spokesperson then ridiculed Matsuoka, saying, "Matsuoka told reporters at the Moscow station, 'If I break my promise, I am willing to commit seppuku to apologize to you.' Now Matsuoka may have clearly known that he could not keep his promise, so he specifically evaded the position of Foreign Minister in order to deny his previous words." Subsequently, a reporter inquired about the false claims broadcast by the Japanese side regarding the Sino-Soviet alliance, the Sino-British military alliance, and the four-nation Sino-British-American-Soviet alliance. The spokesperson replied, "I am not aware of this matter. I only know that the Japanese militarists always spread rumors before launching an aggressive action as an excuse for their actions. I remember that last summer, the Tokyo side constantly broadcast news of an alliance between China and Vietnam. A few days later, the Japanese army actually used the excuse of self-defense? to occupy northern Vietnam. Today, only in the past one or two weeks, they have repeatedly spread rumors of a Sino-Soviet alliance, a Sino-British alliance, and a four-nation Sino-British-American-Soviet alliance. What is the purpose? I believe you can all imagine it. In short, the Japanese side will take action sooner or later, and this action, whether it is south first and then north, or north first and then south, and regardless of whether it uses pressure or force, is related to the interests of the four countries of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union and the security of the entire Pacific. Yesterday, responsible persons in London said that Britain and the United States will impose a full embargo on Japan. This is indeed the most urgent and effective way to stop Japan from taking further action." The spokesperson also praised the establishment of the Anglo-Soviet agreement, saying that this is the best measure for Britain and the Soviet Union to strike at their real common enemy and their potential common enemy. Foreign Minister Guo sent a special telegram to Sir Cripps, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, in his private capacity a few days ago, expressing that the success of the agreement with the Soviet Union is the initial crystallization of our past efforts to unite the anti-aggression forces. Sir Cripps also sent a telegram to Foreign Minister Guo to express his gratitude, believing that this is a joint effort to welcome the dawn of world civilization again. Regarding the British government's expression of willingness to negotiate with our government on abolishing the special privileges in China after Foreign Minister Guo and Hull exchanged notes in the United States, the spokesperson especially emphasized the timing, believing that this is an expression of the friendly countries' guarantee of actively strengthening the unity of the anti-aggression forces on the basis of equal footing.

### Britain and the United States Welcome Toyoda's Appointment as Japanese Foreign Minister

United Press, London, 19th - Yesterday, the British side issued its first opinion on the new Japanese cabinet, believing that the new cabinet will act very cautiously. Responsible officials said that Japan is following its independent path and avoiding being influenced by Germany. The pro-Axis Yosuke Matsuoka has been dismissed, and Hiranuma, who is not very pro-Axis, is only a minister without portfolio. This is an encouraging sign.

United Press, Washington, 19th - Senator Walter George, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the new government in Japan is a "status quo" government whose task is to balance forces and then decide on Japan's future actions. Therefore, the new cabinet may re-open the path to friendly relations with the United States. He said that the State Department is quite willing to maintain open contact with Japan, and if the new cabinet has the desire to maintain the international balance of power and the status quo, then better relations between the United States and Japan can be achieved.

United Press, Tokyo, 19th - British and American people here unanimously welcomed Teijiro Toyoda's assumption of the position of Foreign Minister in the Konoe cabinet. They believed that this move indicates a conservative policy. The new cabinet is a strongly nationalistic faction, which is an independent nationalism that advocates following the free and fair policies of daily developments, rather than being bound by treaty obligations, so that Japan can take advantage of any major changes to reap profits. The financial community welcomes the new cabinet because of Hiranuma's strong influence. Hiranuma is regarded as a major businessman and has a significant influence on the Ministry of the Navy. Tokyo's Japanese newspapers also welcome the new cabinet. The stock market is stable. Japanese newspapers criticized recent foreign policies, especially regarding the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty. A reporter from the Hochi Shimbun, when discussing the treaty and the position of Foreign Minister, said, "What we need is a person whose vision can reach at least one year into the future." Domei News Agency said that the choice of Foreign Minister was due to his possible influence overseas. Japanese newspapers said that the main difficulty for Japan is to resolve the "China Incident," while continuing to discuss the "Siberian problem" after the Soviet-German war. The newspapers indicated that the new cabinet's current results for the country are, first, the government will intensify control over industry in order to increase wartime production, second, implement new economic procedures, and third, implement stricter food controls.

### Germany Officially Announces the Occupation of Smolensk, 230 Miles from Moscow, Fierce Fighting in Progress on All Fronts

Havas Agency, Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 18th - Today marks the 27th day since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. After German forces occupied the city of Smolensk, they began advancing along the highway towards Moscow. The vanguard is almost only 230 miles away from Moscow. The purpose of the German forces is to inflict a major blow on the Soviet Union both materially and spiritually by occupying the Soviet capital. The attack on the two cities of Kiev and Leningrad is of secondary nature. Currently, the left wing of the German forces advancing towards Leningrad has reached the city of Novgorod. Heavy artillery is constantly bombarding the railway from Leningrad to Moscow, causing it to lose contact and preventing it from providing mutual assistance. North of Leningrad, Finnish forces have increased pressure after breaking through the Red Army's first line of defense on the Karelian Isthmus, and have continued to make progress between Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of Finland. The right wing, that is, the German-Romanian Allied forces on the southern route, have gained the upper hand in the Nistru River basin, Bukovina, and central Bessarabia. The Red Army's mechanized units in this area have a thicker strength and have launched large-scale counterattacks several times since the 13th of this month, but the German forces have still won. This layer is quite worthy of attention. As for Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, it is still in the hands of the Red Army, but the German forces have already crossed the city and surrounded it. At present, is there a relatively complete Red Army unit on the eastern side of the Leningrad-Moscow-Kiev line that is capable of recovering lost territory, or will the German flanking strategy be able to inflict a fatal blow on the Red Army? This is really the question. The German objective is clearly to completely eliminate the main force of the Red Army. If this hope cannot be realized, the German forces will launch another offensive after this large-scale offensive. How large the scale will be is difficult to say at this time.

Haitong News Agency, Headquarters of the Leader, 19th - The German military headquarters announced last night that our army, after breaking through the Stalin defense lines of Mochelev and Vitebsk, has advanced to Smolensk. The Soviet army withdrew after strong resistance. Our army formally occupied the city on July 16th. The enemy's attempts to counterattack have all failed.

United Press, Berlin, 19th - The German High Command announced last night the capture of Smolensk. With the fall of the city, there are no major cities on the highway to Moscow. The official announcement was delayed for 48 hours to indicate that the Soviet counterattack at the time of the fall of Smolensk lasted 48 hours. The German military communiqué did not mention the counterattack, only acknowledging that the Soviet army put up terrible resistance. The German army is now advancing to Moscow, this Soviet capital is only 230 miles east of Smolensk, but the German attack on the Soviet capital must cross the Dnieper River to the east and several small rivers. However, the highway to Moscow is of course conducive to the advance of Nazi motorized units. A German military spokesman described the attack on Smolensk, saying that after the German army annihilated a large number of Soviet troops in the area between Vitebsk and Mochelev, it advanced rapidly eastward and occupied the important transportation center of Smolensk on July 16. At this point, the German army has reached the last part of the highway from Minsk to Moscow. Smolensk has a population of 160,000 and has munitions factories, aircraft factories, large textile factories, and other factories. The Bolsheviks defended the city meticulously, but the German army finally broke through their resistance and inflicted heavy casualties on them.

United Press, Moscow, 19th - Soviet and German armies engaged in bloody battles yesterday, with heavy casualties on both sides. Soviet troops are currently fighting hard to counter the German troops approaching the gates of Moscow in Smolensk and to defend Leningrad. The evening communiqué, which also described the fighting on Friday, said that German troops attempting to storm the cities of Beskov and Pokov had become mired, and fierce fighting was underway, but there were no major changes on the front lines. The communiqué did not discuss the fighting in Ukraine to defend Kiev. It was reported that there were fierce battles in Polotsk and Nevel. This communiqué was the first time that Nevel, a railway center 45 miles northeast of Polotsk, had become a battlefield.

Reuters, London, 19th - As a result of the great war in Eastern Europe in the past four weeks, the main battlefields are still in the area near Smolensk in the central region, and in the areas of Polotsk and Nevel south of Leningrad. Today, Soviet communiqués made no mention of the German claim that they had occupied the city of Smolensk, only stating that fierce fighting continued in the Smolensk region. In the past few days, German forces have concentrated their forces in this area and launched fierce attacks regardless of losses. Regarding the battle south of Leningrad, Soviet forces still stated that fierce fighting continued south of Pepsis. As for the southern end of the front line, according to German propaganda, the Tnyestr River in Bessarabia has been crossed in several locations. On the Finnish front, the German side said that Finnish troops had advanced to the north bank of Lake Lagazha. At the same time, the German official news agency disclosed examples of the Soviet scorched earth policy, saying that Vartsila, a small industrial city in Finland ceded to the Soviet Union, which had been the scene of fierce fighting a few days ago, had been occupied by Finnish troops after a fierce artillery battle. It was discovered that it had become a scorched earth, and all the bridges had been destroyed by Soviet forces. According to a Stanbo telegram, a traveler who had just returned from the Soviet Union told people that Moscow now has twelve layers of anti-aircraft gun positions for defense, and dozens of divisions have gathered in the rear.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 19th - The German military headquarters announced today that the German-Romanian Allied forces, who are advancing towards the enemy from Bessarabia, have now crossed the Nistru River (this river is the main obstacle to defending Ukraine).

### German and Romanian Forces Cross the Nistru River, Forming a Large Encirclement of Kiev

Reuters, London, 19th - The German official news agency announced that German troops had occupied Novograd and Volynsk, 130 miles west of Kiev.

### Red Army Implements War of Attrition Strategy Achieving Significant Results in Three Weeks

Reuters, London, 19th – Military commentator Colonel Cazalet of Spain has written an article discussing the Soviet-German war, comparing the strategies of both sides. He states that the German objective is to encircle the enemy with blitzkrieg tactics and destroy their main fighting force. The Soviet strategy, on the other hand, is to inflict maximum attrition on the enemy forces on land while preserving its own strength for resistance, even at the cost of losing large tracts of land. Analyzing the results of the three weeks of fighting, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Although both sides have used many troops and war materials and suffered heavy casualties, this first stage can only be regarded as a large-scale covering operation. (2) The German army advanced 150 miles in the first week, 100 miles in the second week, and 53 miles in the third week, showing the limited nature of their penetrating power. This is due to the brave fighting spirit of the Soviet soldiers, the excellent quality of their equipment, and their effective resistance to the blitzkrieg. (3) The German side has now declared that the first phase has been completed in order to prepare for future major battles and to adjust the supply of provisions, as the Germans have little certainty of supplies after the Soviets have carried out extensive sabotage work behind German lines. (4) In the second phase, the Soviet army will fight from a more advantageous position, as the battlefield defenses are stronger and the lines of communication are both firm and short. The German army, on the other hand, is in a more disadvantageous position, as its supply lines are both longer and weaker.

### German Tank Regiment Decimated, Soviet Air Force Attacks Enemy Transport Ships

Reuters, Moscow, 7th – This morning, the Soviet Union issued its latest communique, announcing the destruction of a German tank regiment and the sinking of two enemy transport ships and five flat-bottomed boats in the Danube River. The communique did not specify the exact location of the destroyed German tank regiment, but described the battle as follows: A German tank regiment invaded Soviet territory along the main road, followed by hundreds of motorized vehicles. The commander of a Soviet motorized infantry unit waited until the Germans reached a bridge over a certain river, then ordered the Soviet disguised artillery and machine guns, concentrated in advantageous positions, to open fire. The artillery roared, the bridge was hit and collapsed, and enemy tanks and motor vehicles caught fire under the rain of bullets. German soldiers fled their vehicles, but were also bombarded, resulting in heavy casualties. They left behind a large number of tanks and weapons. A Soviet air squadron was ordered to attack enemy transport ships and oil barges at the Sulina mouth of the Danube River. They first sent reconnaissance planes to investigate and learned that there was an enemy fleet at Milut in the estuary. Thereupon, Soviet bombers and fighters immediately flew to the area, while a squadron of German fighters also appeared. The Soviet fighters flew to intercept them and engaged in combat. The Soviet bombers took the opportunity to drop bombs on the enemy ships. The first bomb hit a giant flat-bottomed boat, breaking it in two. In an instant, other ships were also hit and burned fiercely. A total of two transport ships and five flat-bottomed boats were destroyed. Three enemy planes were destroyed in the aerial battle. All Soviet aircraft returned to base.

### German Army Encounters Strong Resistance, Expected to Follow Napoleon's Footsteps

Reuters, London, 19th – Today's editorial in The Times reviews the Soviet-German war, stating that the German army has been attacking the Soviet Union for four weeks, and Soviet troops are still fighting everywhere. Although they have encountered difficulties, they maintain good order and display courageous fighting spirit. There has been no collapse, either militarily or politically, as Hitler had anticipated. The spirit of the Soviets is strong and unyielding both at the front and behind the lines, and they are also causing trouble for the enemy in the areas they have already occupied. Hitler has paid a huge price for every inch of ground he has gained in the past four weeks. The main factor in the Soviet Union's resistance is the distribution of its important industries in the east, so there is no longer the problem of being able to inflict a fatal blow by attacking its key points. If Hitler thought he could defeat the Soviet Union in one fell swoop, then his methods are wrong. The Soviet army may retreat backward, leaving only scorched earth, as they did when dealing with Napoleon in the past. The Soviet defenses show no signs of disintegration. If this continues for a long time, even if the German army gains territory, it will not be able to destroy the Soviet Union's ability to continue the resistance. Hitler wants to destroy the Soviet Union first and then defeat Britain, so Britain wants to break his actions to destroy the Soviet Union before the German army has a chance to point its spear westward. It will provide direct and indirect assistance to the Soviet Union to the extent that its strength allows and as is possible. Therefore, if the Anglo-Soviet alliance proceeds swiftly and actively, it can make the day of the German attack on the Soviet Union a turning point in determining the outcome of the war.

### The Mountain City of Western Hubei – Sketches of Badong and Enshi

(Enshi Correspondence) In the past, western Hubei was generally inaccessible due to inconvenient transportation. Apart from talking about the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and knowing some stories about Zhang Fei, Changban Slope, and Qu Yuan's exile in Zigui, even travelers rarely ventured there.

Fanning Yourself on Sunny Days – A Rain Turns It to Autumn

In recent years, the so-called wailing of monkeys in the Wu Gorge and the dangers of Guanshan Mountain have been overcome by the times. The author came to Enshi, this mountainous area, and did not feel the hardship of the journey. The weather here is similar to that of Chongqing. You fan yourself on sunny days, but a rain turns it into deep autumn. On average, there are two sunny days for every rainy day in summer.

A Small Mountain City – Slopes Everywhere

Because of the many mountains, there are slopes everywhere. The customs and folkways are still quite simple and ancient. Because the land is barren, the people are hardworking, but poor. Comparing Enshi to the saying about Guizhou, "No three sunny days, no three miles of flat land, no three cents of silver for the people," is also quite fitting.

What Urgently Needs Sowing – Are Seeds of Culture

The terrain here is between 400 and 2,000 meters above sea level. The mountains are many and the land is high, making planting difficult. The lives of the farmers are quite difficult, but compared to other rural areas in western Hubei, it is still a relatively wealthy area. Tea and rice are produced in the low mountain areas, and Enshi black tea and Enshi green tea are famous. When we travel here, we feel that this is a cultural wasteland. Living here and seeking spiritual food is like searching for a thirst-quenching spring when traveling in the desert, equally difficult. What urgently needs to be cultivated and planted first is the sowing of cultural seeds.

Although Food Is Insufficient – It Is Being Supplied

Food is not self-sufficient in Enshi, but the control of food and prices here can be said to be fairly satisfactory. On the one hand, people are sent to Hunan Province to purchase rice for relief, and on the other hand, food is distributed according to the number of people. The general public eats egg rice (i.e., rice with the husk) mixed with miscellaneous grains.

Fortunately, Management Is Effective – Prices Are Not Very High

The prices of ordinary daily necessities are: firewood four cents per catty, pork one dollar and twenty cents per catty, eggs ten cents each, and flour seventy cents per catty. From the selling prices of these necessities of life, we know that the standard of living here is lower than in other places. This is due to accurate and conscientious price assessment and proper management.

Enshi Is Progressing – It Has a Future

I embarked on the Long March, and it can be said that I went through a rather bumpy journey in Enshi, but I am very pleased that everything in Enshi is progressing, and Enshi will have its future. (June 25th)

### British Naval Patrols to Extend to Arctic Ocean, British Anti-Submarine Warfare Strength Enhanced, Situation in Atlantic Recently Improved

United Press, London, 19th – Reliable sources here today say that if the Germans occupy Murmansk in the Soviet Union, the British Navy, which is deployed thousands of miles to defend shipping lanes, will have to extend its defense zone to the Arctic Ocean coast. This is because the German occupation of a northern Soviet seaport would give the Nazis another base from which submarines and supply ships could operate in the Atlantic. Although the Atlantic naval battle is still far from victory, the British Navy and Air Force, with the help of the United States, are able to inflict heavy blows on the German attacks in the Atlantic. The situation in the Atlantic has improved recently, and the tonnage of ships lost in June was also very small. There are several other points to note: (1) Due to the continuous attacks by the British Navy and Air Force, the losses of Axis ships have increased. (2) Due to the thoroughness of British fleet protection and other defenses, German submarines and bombers are kept away from the Atlantic, and even when they appear in the Atlantic, it is only temporary, so they have little success. (3) Admiral Alexander recently reported a very satisfactory number of German submarines sunk. (4) Germany lacks submarine sailors, as this, like the Air Force, requires long-term training. (5) The recent sinking of German supply ships clearly shows that these supply ships are supplying German submarines in the Atlantic. (6) After the United States expanded its naval base in Iceland, American ships' patrols have extended to two-thirds of the North Atlantic.

Reuters, Gibraltar, 19th

Several new British pocket destroyers have arrived in the Mediterranean from Britain. These fast motor vessels are extremely light and carry depth charges and equipment to counter aircraft and submarines. The crew includes Canadians and Australians. Britain's anti-submarine warfare strength has been further enhanced.

### Iceland Route, Caribbean Sea, Base Completed

United Press, Washington, 19th – President Roosevelt said that the United States will protect the sea lanes to Iceland and other nearby overseas defense bases from attack or the threat of attack. He did not announce detailed military information, only saying that it was as simple as ABC. He also said that protecting Iceland is protecting the Western Hemisphere, so the lines of communication between the two places cannot be interrupted. The President also said that he will support the Army's request in Congress next week to strengthen the National Guard in case of emergency.

Havas, Brazilian Capital, 18th

The new commander of the U.S. Caribbean Defense Command, General Andrews, recently went to the Argentine capital to attend the country's independence anniversary and has now arrived here. It is said that the naval and air force bases in the Caribbean Sea will soon be completed. The danger of the Panama Canal being attacked by air has been eliminated. Only long-range bombers can now attack the canal, but they will not interfere with shipping. It is also said that the Brazilian and African coasts face each other across the South Atlantic, so defense is extremely important.

### Rumor: Hitler Suddenly Suffers from Epilepsy, Summoning Famous Doctors for Consultation

### Conflict Breaks Out Between German and Romanian Troops

Reuters, Moscow, 19th – The Soviet Information Bureau reported that a serious military conflict broke out between German and Romanian troops near Haro on the Bessarabian front. The incident occurred when German officers, after drinking, beat several Romanian soldiers. The Romanian soldiers were enraged and opened fire on the German camp. A large German infantry detachment rushed out and opened fire on nearby Romanian troops, as if facing a major enemy. Several Romanian troops have been disarmed and taken to the rear by the German army. The German commander is doing his best to prevent other Romanian soldiers from learning about the incident.

### Soviet Women's Army Fighting on Northern Front

Haitong Agency, Berlin, 19th

Haitong Agency has learned that a Soviet women's army and several platoons of young Communist troops have been captured in the battle of Leningrad, totaling more than 13,000 people.

### British Submarines in Mediterranean Sink Seven German Ships

United Press, London, 19th

The British Admiralty announced that British submarines in the Mediterranean have sunk seven German ships, all of which were fully loaded with German troops and munitions.

### Wavell Urges Indian Troops to Maintain Historical Glory

Reuters, Simla, 19th – The new Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, General Wavell, issued an order today stating, "I know that you must be very unhappy about the position of the former Commander-in-Chief. The Indian Army has fought well under my command. Now that I have been given the opportunity to lead the Indian Army in the Great War, it can be said that I am the right person. The government has selected one who can command the federal and allied forces in the most important theater of war. I dare to say that you will consider it an honor for the Indian Army. I will now do my best to carry out the good work he has begun in India and to protect India's defenses and the welfare of its soldiers."

### Vichy Cabinet Reorganized, Peuch Transferred to Minister of the Interior

Reuters, London, 19th – Darlan has resigned from his concurrent position as Minister of the Interior so that he can devote himself more fully to the position of Vice-Premier.

Haitong Agency, Vichy, 19th – Minister of Industrial Production Peuch has been appointed Minister of the Interior, and Secretary of State for National Armaments Hitian has been appointed Undersecretary of the Ministry of Industrial Production.

Havas, Vichy, 18th – The new Minister of the Interior, Peuch, is one of France's young politicians. He once participated in the political party led by Doriot (Doriot was originally a communist leader, but later left the party to organize the French People's Party) and then withdrew. During his tenure as Minister of Industrial Production, he made many contributions to France's reconstruction, such as increasing coal production and signing various agreements with German industry, allowing French factories to resume operation. He was a member of the Steel Industry Association for ten years and attended international steel industry conferences.

Havas, Vichy, 18th – After the government appointed Peuch as Minister of the Interior, political figures here said that the Ministry of the Interior is still subordinate to the Vice-Premier's Office and is subject to the control of Vice-Premier Darlan. It is expected that his concurrent positions as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of the Navy will also be given to others.

### The Current Situation of the Japanese Air Force - Translated from the American Saturday Evening Post

The development history of the Japanese Air Force is extremely short. It was almost after the start of the war against China that it began to catch up rapidly due to military needs.

In September 1940, when Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy, it had more than 4,000 aircraft in the army and navy. Since then, it has manufactured about 250 new aircraft each month. As of the end of February this year, after deducting those lost in the Chinese theater, it actually had about 5,000 aircraft.

In September 1940, the Japanese army stationed about 115 aircraft squadrons in China and Manchuria, with 12 aircraft per squadron, totaling at least 1,380 aircraft, including 40 fighter squadrons, 28 light bomber squadrons, 28 reconnaissance squadrons, and 22 army bomber squadrons. At the same time, the Japanese navy in China, in various bases along the coast of French Indochina, and on various aircraft carriers also had 122 seaplane squadrons, with 12 aircraft per squadron, including 42 fighter squadrons, 25 reconnaissance squadrons, 32 light bomber squadrons, and 23 heavy bomber squadrons, totaling 1,460 aircraft.

Adding the above two numbers, plus the 60 aircraft stationed by the Japanese navy in Lushun, we get a total of 2,900 aircraft. The total number of Japanese aircraft is 4,000. Subtracting this number, there are 1,100 aircraft remaining, of which 200 are stationed in Sakhalin and the South Pacific islands under Japanese mandate, and the other 700 are used for the defense of the three main islands.

When the "China Incident" expanded into war, the manufacturing capacity of Japanese domestic aircraft factories was very doubtful. Raw materials and skilled workers were also lacking. The government urgently submitted the "Aircraft Manufacturing Industry Law" to the House of Representatives to implement centralized production and allow duty-free import of various necessary raw materials. There are now 14 factories manufacturing aircraft engines, propellers, and fuselages. The factory bases have all been expanded, and they can generally build more than 250 aircraft per month.

All the warring countries in the world strictly guard the secrecy of aircraft manufacturing rates. In recent years, Japan's achievements in manufacturing military aircraft (including training aircraft) and engines are generally as follows:

1937: 1,000 aircraft, 2,000 engines.

1938: 1,500 aircraft, 3,000 engines.

1939: 1,800 aircraft, 3,700 engines.

1940: 2,100 aircraft, 4,500 engines.

The sudden surge in Japan's aircraft manufacturing rate in 1940 was entirely the result of joining the "Axis." Before signing this treaty, Japan could build about 150 aircraft per month and about 335 engines. After signing the treaty, all factories stepped up their work to prepare for an "unprecedented war," so the number of aircraft manufactured per month increased to 250 and the number of engines increased to 500.

Japan knew that after colluding with Germany and Italy, it would sooner or later be at war with China or the United States, so it immediately increased its aircraft manufacturing rate to the maximum extent. From January to September 1940, it only built 1,300 aircraft and 2,000 engines, but from October to December, it was able to build 750 aircraft and 1,500 engines. However, due to the lack of raw materials and machine tools, this manufacturing rate may not be sustainable.

Although the various manufacturing plants have expanded their factory bases to provide for further development, they have not been able to fully utilize them. This is entirely due to the American embargo on raw materials. The Japanese government hopes that the 14 factories under its control will be able to manufacture 4,000 aircraft and 8,000 engines each year, but due to the shortage of alloys and machine tools, it is difficult to achieve this goal. Germany and Italy also have no spare capacity to help. Even if the Soviet Union had the capacity, it would not be willing to assist Japan.

Foreign military experts and observers familiar with the Japanese situation believe that Japan's rate of manufacturing 250 aircraft and 500 engines per month will not be able to be maintained for more than six months. Moreover, due to the insufficient supply of alloys and machines, by the end of 1941, it may revert to the old state before September 1940.

Japanese aircraft factories have been short of skilled workers for three years. Several larger factories have established schools to train mechanics and have adopted American manufacturing methods, but all of this has been too slow to meet the urgent need.

Since Germany sent aircraft manufacturing technicians to Japan, the atmosphere in the Japanese aircraft industry has been completely new, but these high-speed experts have more than enough efficiency, but lack emotional connection. They are not very smooth and often scoff at Japanese-style manufacturing techniques.

Along with the technicians came a large number of German pilots. Their purpose was not to train Japanese pilots, but to train them in the secrets of aerial blitzkrieg.

The Germans also brought several of the latest engine models and blueprints for Japanese factories to imitate. Before the outbreak of this European war, Japan had obtained exclusive manufacturing rights for several engines. At that time, the aircraft's speed was 320 miles per hour.

Of the 14 largest aircraft manufacturing plants in Japan, none is comparable in size to those in the United States. The Mitsubishi Aircraft Company in Nagoya is the largest in the country, with a site of 71 acres and about 6,700 employees. The Nakajima Aircraft Company in Tokyo and the Kawanishi Aircraft Company in Hyogo Prefecture are next.

The Japanese army has 18 aircraft regiments, of which two are stationed in Korea, two in Manchuria, and two others are stationed in Taiwan and southern Sakhalin. The rest are mostly scattered throughout the Asian continent, while the naval aircraft are responsible for the air defense of the mainland. Japan proper, Korea, and Taiwan have a total of 19 military airfields, while Manchuria and China have 35, several of which are very large.

The naval air squadrons are most active in the Chinese theater. They can fly to Chongqing and Chengdu. These aircraft are based not only on aircraft carriers and various ports in occupied China, but can also land on the water surface of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The naval air force has 31 airfields in various parts of Japan, including two in Taiwan, one in Seoul, Korea, and one in Lushun.

The navy currently has eight aircraft carriers in active service, none of which are very large in tonnage or speed. The largest are the "Akagi" and "Kaga," with a displacement of 26,900 tons each. The former has a top speed of 28.5 knots, while the latter has a top speed of only 23 knots. The sister ships "Soryu" and "Hiryu" have a displacement of 10,000 tons each, but can reach a speed of 31 knots. The smallest, the "Ryujo" and "Hosho," are only a little over 10,000 tons, with a speed of 25 knots.

The seventh aircraft carrier, named "Akaryu," is larger in tonnage and speed than the current six. Construction began in 1938 and will be completed this year. In addition, Japan has five seaplane transport ships, namely the "Kamui," with a displacement of 17,000 tons and a speed of 15 knots, the "Notoro," with a displacement of 14,050 tons and a speed of 10 knots, and the "Chitose," "Chiyoda," and "Mizuho," with a displacement of 9,000 tons each and a speed of about 20 knots.

The Japanese military spares no effort in cultivating young aviators. In addition to aviation military schools, it has also established special schools to train the so-called "young air soldiers," gathering 15- and 16-year-old youths and giving them short-term basic training, and then listing them as future pilots, technicians, radio operators, or machine gun shooters.

Three years ago, the army aviation school graduated about 300 students each year, including active and reserve officers. It was immediately increased to more than double. In 1940, 700 pilots graduated, and there is still a trend of continued increase this year.

The army currently has more than 2,000 excellent pilots, with active and reserve officers each accounting for half. The navy trains fewer pilots and technicians, but there are also 3,000 of them. There are a total of 6,000. As of the end of last year, there were 58,000 naval and army aviation officers and soldiers.

If we make a brief comparison of the air forces of Japan and the United States, the Japanese army and navy have more than 5,000 bombers and fighters, not including training aircraft. As for the United States, according to Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Knox's announcement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as of the end of February this year, the United States Army and Navy had about 7,000 aircraft, of which training aircraft accounted for 40 percent.

In addition, the United States has far more optimistic prospects for aviation talent than Japan. The United States has countless well-trained pilots. Civilian aviators are all reserve forces for the air force. As of March 1 this year, the United States Army and Navy had enlisted 4,812 civilian pilots, and 914 flight instructors had also joined the Air Force.

### Ample Rice Stocks Leading to High Rice Prices: Rice Merchants Hope for Japanese Advance, Thus Still Buying on Dips, Waiting for Big Profits

Foreign rice arrives daily. Jardine Matheson's "Rising Sun" arrived in port at 9 pm the previous evening, carrying 10,000 bags of low-priced foreign rice for the Shanghai Municipal Council, shipped from Hong Kong. It docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. It is rumored that a large shipment of foreign rice is arriving in Shanghai, aboard the French vessel "Dat de Nan" and the Thai vessel "锡生通," with a combined total of over 80,000 bags. (祖)

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice was still fluctuating. It was initially weak but later rose, with market prices slightly increasing by a few cents to nearly one yuan. After the market opened in the morning, due to the crowded arrivals in recent days, the stock in the market gradually increased. Open investigations by various warehouses showed a total of 1,199,979 bags. However, both actual consumption and hoarding were sluggish, and the market was weak. Subsequently, domestic consumption in the inland areas gradually increased over the weekend, and speculative hoarding also increased due to the establishment of the Japanese cabinet. Some rice merchants hoped that talk of a Japanese advance would resurface, hoping that the source of rice would be cut off so they could reap huge profits. Thus, they took advantage of the low prices to buy, and the market price immediately gradually increased. The current price of small-kernel rice once fell to 120 yuan, then to 119 yuan, but rose again at closing to 121.5 yuan. Yinghua Si is currently at 147.5 yuan, and futures are at 149.5 yuan. No. 2 Siamese rice for June-July is at 139 yuan to 139.5 yuan. The future market is still calling for higher prices, with about 800 tons traded. There were more than 20,000 bags of current rice. No. 1 Saigon rice is at 128.5 yuan, No. 2 is at 120.05 yuan, Min Dang is at 133.5 yuan, Qie Fo is at 127 yuan, Huo Jiao is at 126 yuan, broken rice is at 93.5 yuan, then 91 yuan, and No. 3 is at 81 yuan.

Thick and thin japonica rice from domestic sources remains in short supply and sales are equally weak, so prices remain unchanged and have not fluctuated. Fresh early and late rice from the south port continues to be idle, with prices ranging from 141 yuan to 139 yuan. Wuxi original package white japonica rice is at 133.5 yuan to 133 yuan, and old japonica rice is at 130 yuan.

Glutinous rice prices are falling, and the weather is also erratic, alternating between cool and hot, making sales even more sluggish. Although the source of supply is dwindling and market goods are scarce, the market outlook often shows signs of weakness. However, the price is barely maintained due to the insistence of the owners. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened at 123 yuan, then fell to 119 yuan, while yellow old glutinous rice was only 117 yuan to 114-115 yuan. Glutinous green beans opened at 114 yuan, then fell to 111 yuan. The high-quality Jin Dan domestic glutinous rice sells for 123-124 yuan, while the lower-quality rice sells for around 120 yuan.

### Flour Market Weakens Again

Wheat Flour: Yesterday, the spot market for foreign wheat flour re-entered a flat and weak state. This is because actual sales to local merchants have not been smooth, and overseas orders for flour have already been delivered in batches. No new orders have been placed, and amid the changing international situation, people are restless and uncertain. Those holding goods mostly sell with the market, so the market lacks the strength to rise. Jinlong flour is priced at 31.95 yuan to 31.8 yuan, Paotai flour is priced at 32.9 yuan to 32.85 yuan, and Bodhi brand is priced at 32 yuan. The prices of various goods are all in a fluctuating state, with a total transaction volume of about 10,000 bags. The market has entered a state of brewing.

Wheat: Yesterday's market remained quiet. This is because new wheat from inland areas has not arrived in bulk. Only sporadic shipments from nearby production areas have arrived, amounting to only dozens or hundreds of bags, all of which were purchased by Japanese factories at their stores. The price was around 41 yuan. Chinese factories have temporarily stopped buying.

### Oil Cakes: Speculative Buying; Cottonseed Oil

The futures trading of cottonseed oil was quite active yesterday. This is because general speculators, taking advantage of the lack of supply of raw soybean oil, have been actively buying in large quantities, resulting in the factory supply not meeting demand. Therefore, the market price has gradually risen sharply. The July delivery price of crude oil from factories has jumped from 131.25 yuan to 133 yuan, and the August delivery price has jumped from 132.75 yuan to 134.5 yuan, both rising by two to three yuan compared to the previous day. Other raw soybean oils have also risen by one to two yuan. A total of more than 7,000 dan were traded in the overall market.

Corn: Yesterday's market was bullish because Japanese merchants continued to buy, and prices rose again by 0.5 to 1 yuan. A total of more than 5,000 bags of Saigon and Holland corn were traded in the overall market. (Price details can be found in the market price section). 2,000 pieces of soybean cake will be shipped to Hong Kong on the 20th.

A small number of gold and other banks sold, but soon stopped. Chinese banks had little supply. Chinese speculators were divided. Some foreign banks had an appetite for purchases, leading to a tight US exchange rate of 0.3125, tightening to 5.3125 yuan. The British exchange rate was flat at 3 pence, 234375. Trading was flat in the morning. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.

Japanese Merchants Stop Selling

According to foreign telegrams, the silver market this morning was flat in both Britain and the United States, and Indian silver rose slightly. Among the exchange rates of various countries, the US dollar against the pound rose by 25, and the rest remained unchanged. The central exchange rates remained unchanged. The bank's selling price at the opening of the domestic market was 3 pence and 234375 for the British exchange rate, and 5.34375 yuan for the US dollar. Japanese banks first offered US dollars at 5.375 yuan to foreign banks, and speculators also sold at the same price for the August contract. The market situation was still stable, and foreign banks had a good appetite. HSBC's exchange rates remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax is still levied at 23.75%, and the situation remains stable. Japanese merchant banks stopped selling, and speculators came to buy in August at 5.34375 yuan. Later, other banks had an appetite at the same price. Although Chinese banks sold limited quantities, the situation tightened at noon. At noon closing, both spot and August contracts were 3 pence and 234375 for the British exchange rate, and 5.3125 yuan for the US dollar, which was flat for the British exchange rate and tightened 0.3125 for the US dollar compared to the previous day's closing.

Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises Alone

### Forcibly Pushing Gold Prices Upward: Transactions of 70-80,000 Taels in One Day

Yesterday's gold market saw a fierce rise in the spot dark market, breaking through the 6,500 yuan mark and rapidly advancing towards the peak. The main reason was the increased buying by the Shanghai West Gang, which strongly pushed up prices. Yiyuan increased its buying by 14-15,000 taels, and Li Tai increased by 8,000 taels. Xinfeng Yong and Chengji each increased by 4-5,000 taels. However, as the US exchange rate tightened only slightly, exchange merchants like Dafeng heavily sold, and gold shops like Bangde Da, Hesheng, and securities firms also sold. Although the price rose sharply, it fell from 6,491 yuan to 6,540 yuan, but ultimately continued to rise by 47 yuan, and rose further to 6,555 yuan after closing. 70-80,000 taels were traded in the morning. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. Swaps (July rolling into August) had sellers posting 50 yuan to buyers. Cash was offered by Zhongxing for 50 taels, and Decheng for 30 taels, with the price 460 yuan higher than futures trading, a rise of more than 50 yuan. Gold ornaments also continued to rise by 5 yuan, to 720 yuan.

Futures Rise Again by Nearly Fifty

The market opened at 9:15 AM at 6,508 yuan, 18 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. Suddenly, news came that a Japanese bank was selling US dollars at 5.375 yuan, and the market fell back. Deda, Hesheng, and Defu vigorously sold, causing a retreat to 6,491 yuan. The Shanghai West Gang suddenly came to buy, and Yiyuan and Li Tai bought heavily. Tianyuan, Yida, Qingtai Yong, and retail investors also bought, gradually rising to 6,525 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange rate remained flat and exchange merchants like Dafeng heavily sold, and both Yifeng and Jinzheng gangs had more supply than demand, the price hovered around 6,520 yuan for a long time. Retail investors generally found it easier to profit from the bullish trend. Near noon, the US exchange rate softened to 5.3125 yuan. Yiyuan, Li Tai, Chengji, and Xinfeng Yong vigorously retreated, and Deda repurchased, pushing the price up again by 20 yuan, rising to 6,540 yuan. The noon closing was 6,537 yuan, an increase of 47 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Based on the August US dollar closing price of 5.3225 yuan, the price was 6,555 yuan, a difference of 18 yuan. There was a high-low range of 49 yuan in the morning. After closing, Dafeng and Defu bought, rising to 6,555 yuan. There were few sellers. There was no market in the afternoon. The selling price of gold bars was 470 yuan higher than futures trading, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for current margin.

Yarn & Cotton

### Bullish Buyers Advance Like Snakes: The Range of the Yarn Market Narrows

The yarn market advanced circuitously, but actual sales remained weak. The Hong Kong Gang only handled 30 bales of 32-count yarn, and others only offered prices but did not buy. However, 1,250 pieces of export yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong today. People's confidence is exceptionally strong. This is because there are rumors in the market that a bullish company is being organized, and everyone is being careful not to short sell. The so-called big speculative players are all pushing in factory orders. The market atmosphere is thick, and short sellers have long been intimidated. Therefore, the market is very stable. However, some people say that those who are going long are moving like snakes, and the chips for short selling are certainly few. In this way, the market lacks a major upward trend. Because there is no opponent to fight, waiting for the development of actual sales by the Guangdong Gang is the only way to see a big price increase. Otherwise, it will still remain in a state of fluctuation. The high price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,607 yuan, and the low price was 1,598 yuan. The range was very narrow, only 9 yuan. There was silence in the afternoon due to the weekend.

Shuangma opened in the morning, continuing the strong upward trend of the afternoon of the previous day. The opening price was 1,604 yuan. Generally, scalpers were calling, and it soon rose to 1,607 yuan. However, the foreign exchange rate was flat, and there was still no activity in the business of foreign merchants. The market was slightly weak, easing to 1,598 yuan. However, the bulls still held on and rose again, but it fluctuated around 600 yuan for an hour. The closing price was 1,603 yuan. The statistics for the morning's trading volume show that 6,030 bales were traded. The amounts purchased by various gangs are listed below: Hong Kong 30, Local Gang 6,000, Total 6,030

Shuangma Futures Yarn Market Situation: The market opened in the morning, and because American and Indian cotton were both reported to have risen, and the foreign exchange rate and gold price continued to tighten, short sellers covered their positions in the near term, and bulls closed their positions in the distant term. Near-term prices were firm and distant-term prices were weak, rising or falling by 1 to 2.5 yuan compared to yesterday. After opening, the August contract was slightly higher at 1,462 yuan. The upward momentum for July and September had subsided. After entering the market, due to Saturday, actual demand from the Hong Kong Gang remained stagnant, and many bulls were selling. The July contract once fell to 1,431 yuan, the August contract to 1,456 yuan, and the September contract to 1,518 yuan. Finally, due to short covering, prices recovered slightly. The result of the noon closing was that all months fell by 1 to 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the morning are recorded below (net bid prices):

Market Notice: July yarn is scheduled to be delivered on the 30th, and the market will be closed for one day.

### Fine Cotton Prices are Too High

Coarse Cotton Becomes the Target of Speculation

The current cotton situation is that factory demand is flat, but the industry has good intentions. However, fine cotton prices are already high, and trading has decreased. The target of speculation has shifted to coarse cotton. Another report states that foreign cotton order trading by Shanghai foreign firms is still active due to the strong prices of American and Indian cotton. In addition to a few cotton brokers and factories procuring spot transactions, most traders and yarn factories are actively ordering Brazilian and Indian cotton to be shipped in July and August, because the selling price of spot American and Indian cotton is 20 yuan higher than directly ordering futures.

The New York cotton market initially fell due to selling by foreign merchants, but then rebounded due to buying by domestic traders and active short covering. As a result, the closing price rose by about 13-14 points compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose sharply due to strong buying interest, but then fell slightly due to cotton merchants selling and bulls taking profits. Yesterday's closing price rose by 2-3 rupees. The opening market situation is forecast to rise by 2.5 rupees due to the strong rise in American cotton.

### Piece Goods: Significantly Reduced Inflow and Outflow

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market situation was stable, because the Far East situation was not yet clear, and people were watching and waiting. Speculative inflows and outflows were rare, presenting a situation of stagnation. The sales disks of various cloths fluctuated by one or two corners. Goods that were out of stock still saw squeezed increases. The street closed around three hundred plus pieces of spot and forward goods, two hundred plus pieces of bleached, dyed, and printed cloth from the Cantonese and Southeast Asian gangs, and one hundred plus pieces of flannel, broadcloth, and serge from the northern Shandong and Qingdao gangs. Moreover, 965 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today (the 20th).

Eastern Cloth: The market盘 was firm as before. There were very few changes during the half-day process. The fine cloth futures of the market exchange improved by 2 corners this month. September/October dropped by one corner to one corner and four points. Spot market Longtou (leader) fine cloth factory raised 1 corner and 2.5 points. The closing price was 49 yuan, 3 corners, and 2.5 points. For dyed cloth, the Gentlemen's serge group thought the prices would increase, and no one wanted to sell the goods. Business was especially clear. The closing price was still 1 yuan, 6 corners, and 1 point.

### New Land Ramie Cloth: Large Volume Supply

Wax Line Ramie Tarpaulin: This summer's market is selling extraordinarily. Factories like Lianxin and Gongping have had supply unable to meet demand. Currently, there are signs that it will go out of stock soon. Currently, there is a large volume of supply. The New Land factory is the only one that offers a price of 2 yuan and 4 corners a piece of ramie.

### Sugar Cane and Cane Sugar (3) by Gao Jiannong, Foreign Countries Part

However, those people of Central Europe who lived in dark times, whether they were emperors like Redbeard, or knights in the ancient Goth style, not to mention the serfs who were poorly fed and clothed, probably did not dare to dream of enjoying cane sugar at this time. It was not until the Crusades arose after 1096 AD that they had the opportunity to come into contact with the East, and they were fortunate enough to taste and admire this "honey made from reeds". Therefore, the frequent visits of the crusaders served as a live advertisement for cane sugar and fulfilled their duty of propaganda. As for the cities that supplied them with goods, of course, they were Dongbima Kyoto Constantinople and Venice in Italy. From then on, by the mid-12th century, the sales of cane sugar in southern France had become very active; by the 13th century, many German poets had already sung and depicted it; In 300 years, a cookbook published in southern Germany listed in detail the various foods and dishes made with cane sugar, with everything that should be available; even in 1573, the city of Ausbourg, Germany, had already established a refined sugar factory, and in 1597, a sugar factory in Dresde was also established. Soon, these sugar factories rose up one after another and stood everywhere, and even the status of people engaged in this occupation was greatly improved, and they seemed to be in the ranks of the nobility! (To be continued)

### Securities: Bond Market Mostly Flat

The dark market for public bonds was quite promising yesterday, but Dingkang suddenly sold a large batch on behalf of a certain account, which slightly dampened the market. Buyers were also very active, so the result was a very flat market, providing an opportunity for others to pick up goods. It is rumored that the news from Chongqing is very favorable to the bulls, but it has not been announced and it is unknown whether it is true. Yesterday was Saturday, so there was only one session. The market opened at 11:00 AM, and Lianhe and Tongkang were buying very actively, with opening prices as high as 1.6 yuan. Dingkang sold a large batch on behalf of a certain account, causing the market price to fall. Then, Xinhua and Zhongfu banks actively absorbed the goods, and Jiufeng, Lianyi, and Xinfu also bought. In addition to Dingkang, Yongkang, Zhongyi, Shengsheng, and No. 38 also supplied goods. Despite Dingkang's large sales, Grade C bonds only fell by a small corner. Grade A, B, and E bonds did not move. Only Grade D bonds had one market price, falling by 4.5 corners. The total transaction volume was about 1.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below: Category, Highest, Lowest, Closing, Compared to the Previous Day

Stock trading: 50 shares of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange were traded, with a price of 37.5 yuan.

The British-owned Hengye Real Estate Co., Ltd. has set the date of August 7 to issue an interim dividend for 1941 of 40 cents per share in national currency.

London, 18th (Friday) Telegram: The listed market for Chinese foreign bonds and British companies in the Far East remained flat and sluggish. Only HSBC's Hong Kong-registered shares fell by £1, with a price of £84. There were offers but no buyers, and the rest remained unchanged.

### Sugar Market: Crude White Continues to Tighten

Yesterday's sugar market saw crude white rise, with occasional slight easing. Refined white was slightly tight, and Dutch red was also firm. The association's fee was offered at 24 for spot crude white. The April import was 94.35 yuan, up by half a yuan. The May import was 94.7 to 95.2 yuan, up by 7-8 corners. The June import was 95.2 to 7 corners, a slight easing of 3 corners, probably because it rose by one yuan the previous day, so there was a small correction. Dutch red KD mark was 76.5 yuan, and NT mark was 74.5 and 8 corners, up by 6 corners. TOO mark oil package was 73.3 yuan. Taikoo refined white B mark new goods was 118 yuan, up by 5 corners, and old goods was 116 yuan, up by almost a yuan. HX mark was 94.2 yuan, up by 2 corners, and old goods was 93.19 yuan, up by nearly a yuan.

### Coal: Boshan Dust Arrives Again: 3,700 Tons

Various grades of coal dust have recently been bought by local merchants, and sales have been strong. However, there have also been many arrivals. It was recently reported that Hongsheng Warehouse in Pudong received another 3,700 tons of Boshan dust, which was unloaded at the pier, so the market situation has been slightly stabilized. Yesterday's price among traders for Boshan dust stored in the warehouse was 285 yuan per ton, a drop of 4-5 yuan compared to the previous market.

### North-South Goods: Noodles Recover

After falling back, rice noodles had at most fallen to 40 yuan. Qingdao noodles were worse. The market has recently seen a turnaround. Longkou noodles have recovered by 10 yuan, selling for 235 yuan. Qingdao noodles have recovered by more than 10 yuan, selling for 220 yuan. Lower grades are flat. Jiangbei noodles and soup noodles are both priced at around 90 yuan.

### Stabilization Fund Agrees on Principles: Decides to Maintain Shanghai's Foreign Exchange Rate; Absorbing Supply and Demand According to Natural Trends: Aims to Protect the Interests of Legitimate Merchants

The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee of China, based on the opinions contributed by American committee member Fox after his investigation, has recently agreed on principles after discussions among the committee members in Hong Kong. It has decided to do its best to maintain the stability of Shanghai's black market exchange rate in the long term, to protect the interests of legitimate merchants.

Stabilizing Exchange Rates and Eliminating Speculation

According to banking sources yesterday, the measures for maintaining Shanghai's black market exchange rate are highly confidential and will not be disclosed to the outside world. Maintaining a stable exchange rate in the long term is the only good way to protect legitimate merchants from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, and to prevent speculators from using their old tricks in the market. Because near-term and distant-term exchange rates are stable, conspirators cannot implement their arbitrage plans.

Following Water Levels, Constantly Ingesting and Excreting

Therefore, the Stabilization Fund Committee has authorized friendly banks to supply as much as possible when the black market exchange rate shrinks sharply, and to absorb as much as possible when it loosens wildly, so as to bring the exchange rate to its natural level. Although it is well known that maintaining Shanghai's exchange rate involves huge losses, the reason for continuing to maintain it is to protect legitimate merchant trade. Therefore, legitimate merchants, both Chinese and foreign, have expressed their support for the Stabilization Fund's measures.

### The Old Site of the Taxpayers' Association is Occupied: No Impact; Important Documents Moved to Hong Kong: Association Affairs Handled Elsewhere

Since the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai International Settlement, Wang Xiaolai and Xu Jiyin, went to Hong Kong, their important documents have been moved to Hong Kong, and all association affairs are being handled elsewhere. The premises originally leased at Room 303, 3rd Floor, No. 59 Hong Kong Road, have long been locked and not used. Since the news that the old site of the association was occupied reached Hong Kong the day before yesterday, the person in charge of the association announced that the association is the only legal organization in the Shanghai International Settlement, and is supported by a majority of representatives. Even if the old site of the association is occupied, the legal status of the association will not be affected in any way.

### Major Bowen: Leaving Shanghai at the End of the Month: For a Seven-Month Vacation in Canada

Major Bowen, Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Police, will leave Shanghai on the 31st of this month for a seven-month vacation in Canada.

### Change in the Situation of the Soviet-German War; Kuomintang and the Communist Party Intensify Unity; With the Same Goal, Joint Action Should Be Taken to Strive for the Survival of the Chinese Nation Together

Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the international situation has become clearer, and the front line of the anti-aggression group has become more consolidated. China, as the vanguard of anti-aggression, is closer to the stage of victory in its great cause of resistance and construction. According to a certain political figure in the city speaking to a Dagong News Agency reporter, the outbreak of the Soviet-German war may lead to a resolution of the long-standing Kuomintang-Communist issue. Therefore, China's future is extremely bright, and the attainment of final victory is only a matter of time. The various points he discussed are recorded below:

Two Groups: Justice and Aggression

The world today has formed two unbreakable groups. One is the aggression group combined with hegemony and power, namely Germany, Italy, Japan, and their vassal states. This group specializes in destroying the rights of other countries, plundering the territories of other countries, disrupting human peace, and preventing human evolution. Therefore, countries that have been or will be victimized have no choice but to rise up to resist or assist in resistance in order to seek their own survival. China, as the first country to resist aggression, raised the banner of anti-aggression in the Far East as early as the summer of 1937, calling on all countries in the world that have been invaded and coerced. As a result, the anti-German war in Britain and the recent anti-German war in the Soviet Union have successively occurred. The reasons for their resistance are roughly the same: to oppose aggression and maintain national survival. Therefore, their goals are the same as those of China's war. Since their goals are the same, the actions taken should also be consistent. Therefore, another group that resists aggression for justice has been formed.

Soviet-German War Benefits China

The recent outbreak of the Soviet-German war has a great impact on China's anti-Japanese construction. Germany and Russia are both acting against the Axis powers, with the same goals, and the steps they take should be consistent. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party, which listens to Moscow, should act in accordance with national policies and obey the supreme commander, striving for victory. Past frictions will become historical relics. Since the Communists in Russia can fight to the death for the survival of their nation, the Communists in China should also awaken and fight hard for the survival of the Chinese nation.

### Patriotic Sentiment of Russian Émigrés Is Becoming More Intense; Continuing to Donate to the Red Cross Fund; Uniting in the Face of National Crisis

Yesterday, the Russian-language newspaper received a large donation from Hankou. The surname of the Russian émigré who made the donation is unknown, only bearing the name of the initiator "KTM". The amount totaled one thousand yuan and was

Donated to the Red Cross

to be used as a fund. In addition, the Moscow National Bank in this city received donations of 23,644.19 yuan from White Russians and American émigrés in the first half of July. There were also many donations of old Russian currency and British gold coins. The Moscow National Bank, which previously collected funds for the Red Cross, specially opened a special office at No. 244 to handle this matter. From June 26 to 30, it received donations of 5,277.29 yuan in five days.

Patriotic Enthusiasm

among Russian émigrés in this city has not diminished slightly due to the prolonged war. The efforts of the Henry Luhua Russian Credit Cooperative in collecting Red Cross donations are commendable. The Soviet General Association is also carrying out the work of collecting comfort items among the Soviet émigrés. The first batch of comfort items is expected to be transported to the Soviet Union in the near future and handed over to the Red Army soldiers on the front line. In addition, the Russian-language newspaper receives several letters from Russian émigrés every day, expressing their wish for Soviet victory. All this shows that Russian émigrés in this city regard mutual solidarity as the most important thing in the face of national crisis.

### After the Closure of the American School, Private School to be Established; The Board of Directors Will Do Its Best to Assist; Maintain Its Finances Through Cooperation

Since the large-scale withdrawal of American overseas Chinese in this city at the end of last autumn, as ordered by the State Department, the number of American women and children residing in Shanghai has been decreasing day by day. The American Children's Public School, established on Baidang Road in the French Concession, has had to suspend boarding first due to the return of students, teachers, and staff to their home countries, and then announced an indefinite closure from April 17 this year. However, since a part of the school's students are still staying in Shanghai and have no place to enroll, their courses have been abandoned. Therefore, there is a proposal to establish another private school.

No Relation to the Board of Directors

The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that the American School in this city was closed indefinitely from April 17 due to the withdrawal of many American children, leaving those still in Shanghai with no suitable place to study. Mr. Cina, an American overseas Chinese, has taken note of this and is now planning to establish a small-scale private school. The Board of Directors of the American School has nothing to do with this, but will do its best to assist. There are still seven American school teachers and about one hundred students remaining in Shanghai, of which 35% are American children, and the rest are non-American. Most of the American children in Shanghai have returned to the United States.

Cooperative Maintenance of Private School Finances

According to Mr. Cina, the location of the school has not yet been selected, and the amount of tuition has not yet been decided. The school's finances will be maintained through cooperation. Parents of students staying in Shanghai who wish to discuss with Mr. Cina can call 70199, No. 10 Baidang Road. It is also understood that the school will have grades from the second grade to the twelfth grade, teaching various basic subjects. The teachers will be former American Public School teachers staying in Shanghai, and the textbooks will also be borrowed from the original school, so everything is convenient. The American Public School originally had more than 500 students, 80% of whom have returned to their home countries, and about 100 are currently staying in Shanghai.

### Shooting Incident at a Dance Hall Near the New World

Recently, major movie theaters, dance halls, etc. in Shanghai have been subject to extortion of protection fees by gangs. If their demands are not met, they throw smoke bombs and hand grenades and wantonly destroy the premises. This has been happening repeatedly. A dance hall located at No. 47 Yuqiaqing Road was doing quite well in business, which attracted the attention of gangsters. At about 10:15 pm last night, when the lights were bright and the dance floor was full of guests, six or seven gangsters suddenly appeared in the outer corridor of the dance hall, next to the high tables. They first threw a metal can bomb, which exploded with a loud bang. Fortunately, no damage was done. The gangsters then drew their guns and fired wildly, firing more than a dozen shots. When the bullets were flying, dance guests Li Zushou (28 years old, from Ningbo, working in the Shanghai West Police Department, living at No. 18 Pingyuanfang, Dapu Bridge) and Su Dazhong (26 years old, a Western medicine doctor, living at No. 660 Avenue Edward VII) were both hit by stray bullets on the spot. Li was shot in the left abdomen and seriously injured. Su's left arm was pierced by a bullet. A Portuguese man named Su Shi, who was working as an inspector at the dance hall, bravely rushed out in the hail of bullets, trying to chase after one of the gangsters, but was also shot in the back of his left hand, and bled profusely. The murderers then rushed out and fled. Later, Chinese detectives from the New Zhabei Police Station, No. 486, arrived and sent the injured to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The police are currently searching for the gunmen.

### Japanese Consulate Police Arrest Japanese Nationals

### Shen Bao's Young Readers Demonstrate a Spirit of Mutual Assistance; Using Parents' Rewards to Contribute to Scholarships

Yesterday was the eighth day of the scholarship fundraising campaign for the readers of this newspaper.

In addition, a theater group from a certain university will soon perform a play to raise funds, and will donate all the proceeds to the scholarship fund. In addition, enthusiastic people from the business community are advocating group donations, and it is expected that a large amount of money will break the past record within days.

Therefore, the actual total is 4,603 yuan and 62 cents.)

Elementary School Students Arouse Sympathy

Zhou Songquan, a fourth-grade student at Fuchun Elementary School, wrote, "Because I got excellent grades in the exam this semester, my dad is very happy and wants to take me to the company today to buy a set of clothes as a reward. Of course, I feel very happy. Suddenly I remembered the Shen Bao's appeal for scholarship funds for poor children, and I felt deeply sorry for those poor children. It is not easy to study, and I realized that studying hard is my duty. How can I accept my dad's reward? Therefore, I asked to donate this money to the Shen Bao scholarship fund. My parents agreed and gave me 50 yuan. Now I am sending it all in. Please include it as a scholarship to show the spirit of mutual assistance among children." Zhou's words are very touching. I wish you progress in your studies.

Righteous Deeds of Coal Workers

Mr. Sui Jingchun of Shanghai Coal Company strongly agrees with this newspaper's scholarship fund. He appealed to some of his colleagues yesterday and received an immediate response, raising 84 yuan. Mr. Sui said that if he gains anything, he will continue to contribute. Such enthusiasm is truly commendable. Also, Ms. Ying Shuiyu and Ms. Gu Qiying wrote yesterday, requesting that the names of the people who raised the funds as a group be published one by one. This is very difficult because the space is limited. Please forgive us.

### Gambling Dens Still Exist in Western Shanghai; Only a Few Small Gambling Dens Have Been Cracked Down On

According to the English-language "Great American Evening Post," although the Special Police in Western Shanghai are trying to eliminate gambling in the western district, there were at least four large-scale gambling dens in the western district last night (the 18th).

### An Employee of HSBC Bank Cheats Money Lenders of Huge Sums of Money; Three Money Lenders Cheated of 320,000 Yuan; The Suspect Has Not Yet Been Apprehended After Being Reported to the Police

According to the English-language "Great American Evening Post," Li Xinkang (transliteration) from Wuxian, who worked in the exchange department of HSBC Bank and also acted as an exchange broker, recently cheated three money lenders on Sichuan Road of a huge sum of 320,000 yuan and fled without a trace.

According to the managers of the three money lenders who were cheated, Li had been doing business with them for three years and had always been honest. Therefore, they trusted him and even

Handed Over Large Sums of Money to Li

without requiring receipts. On the 14th and 15th of this month, Li borrowed 320,000 yuan in legal tender from the three money lenders and deposited the same amount of US dollars as collateral, saying that when he repaid the loan, he would pay interest as usual. On the afternoon of the 15th, Li went to the three money lenders again, saying that he needed to use the US dollars he had deposited urgently and would return them on the same day. After saying this, he signed a personal check to offset the loan. The three money lenders trusted him and

Did Not Suspect Anything

### Ministry of Education Restricts Middle School Students from Transferring Schools at Will; Four Regulations Issued

(Chongqing Airlines News) The Ministry of Education believes that in recent years, many middle school students have been transferring schools at will. The original schools have not imposed any restrictions, and the receiving schools have not investigated the reasons for the transfers, and have hastily assigned grades, resulting in students transferring their academic records at will, which has greatly affected the academic atmosphere. It is imperative to strictly restrict transfers in order to rectify the situation. The following precautions are specially stipulated: (1) Transfers are not allowed in the middle of a semester; (2) The transfer certificate must state the grades or attach a transcript so that the school admitting the transfer student can check them and avoid confusion; (3) Students who are expelled will not be issued a transfer certificate; (4) The school admitting the transfer student must, within one month after assigning grades, prepare a roster of transfer students, filling in detailed information on the school they transferred from, the reason for the transfer, the grades of each subject in the original school, and the results of the grade assignment test, and submit them along with the transfer certificate and transcript to the主管敎育行政機關 for approval. Before approval, they can only be treated as auditors.

### Seven Academic Lectures; Sun Guiding Lectures on the Psychology of Learning

The academic lecture series organized by the eight elders in this city has been held six times, assisting teachers in primary and secondary schools in this city to improve their studies. Yesterday was the seventh lecture, which was still held at the Xuan Palace Theater. Dr. Sun Guiding, the current professor of Jinan University and director of the Education Department of Guanghua University, lectured on "The Psychology of Learning," saying that the topic I am talking about today can be roughly divided into two parts. The first is memory and forgetting, and the second is how to improve learning effectiveness. (1) We must use past experiences to create great careers. The inability to restore past experiences is forgetting. If we suffer losses in everything, then memory is very important. (2) We must feel interested in the material. Paying attention to the psychology and physiology of learning, the most important thing is endurance. If we can still study hard even when we are tired, then the effect of improving the work will inevitably increase.

Study Lectures

### The Method of Historical Research (6) - Xue Wujing

(C) The Study of Oracle Bone Script: In the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu (1899), many tortoise shells and animal bones were discovered in Xiaotun, five miles northwest of Anyang County, Henan Province, with ancient characters carved on them. Merchants took them to Beijing and sold them to Wang Yirong. After research by many people, it was discovered that they were divination texts from the Shang Dynasty. From the ninth to the twenty-first year of the Republic of China (1920-1932), excavations were conducted seven times, unearthing many artifacts. Luo Zhenyu wrote "Revised and Annotated Inscription of Yin Ruins," and Wang Guowei wrote "Annotations on Yin Ruins Characters Collected in Jianyun Hall," examining the institutions of the Yin and Shang Dynasties and the historical traces of former kings and ancestors. They largely coincided with the records in the "Records of the Grand Historian," and the saying that "the people of Yin revered ghosts" was also proved by physical evidence. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that China's credible history began in the Shang Dynasty. Guo Moruo also wrote "Comprehensive Annotations on Divination Inscriptions," which also made a great contribution.

The above narrative is due to a major modern discovery, sufficient to change the concept of researchers of ancient history. Scholars of history must pay attention. Other materials such as the manuscripts of the Dunhuang Stone Chamber, the bamboo slips of Gansu and Xinjiang, and the inscriptions on bronze and stone are all of great value in determining historical materials. I am unable to describe them in detail any further.

(2) The Selection of Materials: Liang Qichao's "Method of Historical Research" states, "There are only two ways to obtain historical materials: one is outside of written records, and the other is written historical materials." The breadth of its collection and the scope of its material are astonishing. What else can be said? However, if one is broad but lacks focus, and the selection is not rigorous, one will still follow in the footsteps of predecessors, only to leave scholars sighing in vain. What is the benefit? I believe that all materials can be summarized in three points: thought, economy, and culture. To speak of them separately:

Children's Weekly

### Please Help Children Sponsor the Shen Bao Scholarship Movement

— Wan

Children reading the Shen Bao, what are your thoughts upon seeing the letter of request from the three children Ni, Bao, and Wu, the Shen Bao's promoted scholarship campaign, and the recent donations from people in society? We look around, and there are not just these three children who cannot afford to go to school, but even more, thousands upon thousands of children who are living in conditions of cold and hunger, wasting away day by day, squandering their precious childhoods. There are also many poor students who aspire to advance to middle school and university, but the six years of elementary school have already made them worried. Some drop out halfway, while others are fortunate enough to graduate and immediately step into the world of work. There are countless poor students striving to advance like this, but economic circumstances prevent them from progressing, and their special talents are buried by their environment. The three children Ni, Bao, and Wu are just three, lucky ones among the unfortunate. Because of these three children's eagerness to learn and their lofty ambitions, the Shen Bao launched a scholarship campaign not only to enable these three children to fulfill their wishes but also to help other poor students in society who are determined to advance, creating useful talents for the nation. Therefore, they are appealing to people in society to make donations. I think that children with better living conditions can certainly appreciate the difficulties of poor students' lives and the pain of dropping out of school. Don't be left behind; stand in the position of a child and do something!

We should not think that we do not earn money and therefore should not donate, nor should we think that our money is too little to be of much use. In our circumstances and positions, we can do the following things:

1.  Save pocket money for other uses: Many children like to eat snacks, spending their money and then asking their parents for more. Calculating the cost of snacks and other expenses for a month is sure to be considerable. When we go to buy snacks, we should think about it from the perspective of others. We have already eaten three meals, and it is really inappropriate to eat this and that. If we save the money and donate it to poor children, wouldn't that be a meaningful thing to do?

2.  Donate together: One person's money is indeed limited, but we can join forces with familiar children and donate together. The results are sure to be not bad.

3.  Publicize and solicit donations: If you yourself do not have the strength to donate, then in front of your parents or relatives and friends, speak about the hardship of the children who have no means to study. Seeing that you are so young, have such compassion, and are willing to enthusiastically help others, they will certainly be happy to donate. Children! Don't shirk responsibility, don't be shy, and do something for those poor children! They are looking up, waiting for your sponsorship.

### The Soviet Union's Million Little Heroes

— Long Jusheng

It has been three weeks since the Soviet Union was invaded by the mad Nazi leader, Hitler! Hitler boasted that he could conquer Moscow, the Soviet capital, in six weeks? Solve the Soviet Union? However... the Soviet and German sides have been fighting fiercely, and the heroic stories of the Soviet soldiers' resistance can be compared to China's four years of bitter struggle! The Soviet soldiers' bravery, even to the point of being shattered to pieces! Refusing to kneel and surrender! It is truly worthy of song and praise. How did they become so strong and brave? Well! They were forged from childhood, militarized. I happened to see a TASS report from Moscow dated May 22nd of this year, saying: The Soviet Union's nationwide children's military sports competition has already begun on the 10th. First, elimination rounds are held in various schools and districts, with no fewer than one million children participating. Including 411,000 people in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, 823,000 people in Ukraine, 112,000 people in Belarus, and 110,000 people in the Karachay-Cherkess Republic. Most of them have passed the "Order of Defense and Labor" examination.

The Soviet Union's million little heroes! Now is the time to test their skills. Children, looking back at your own enjoyment and comfort during the national crisis, you are still able to study happily. Happiness is happiness, but compared to the spirit of the Soviet Union's million little heroes, what are your thoughts?

### Wonders After the Rain

— Lin Ren

A-liang's father was writing with great effort, and A-liang was sitting in a chair, staring blankly at the heavy rain outside the window. The sound of the pouring rain was like being in front of a large waterfall in the depths of the mountains, creating a different kind of feeling.

At this time, his sister happened to rush back from a relative's house, drenched all over. Her clothes were soaked through with rainwater, completely wet, truly like a drowned chicken just fished out of the water. As soon as she stepped into the door, she interrupted her father's writing, stopped her mother's laundry, and startled A-liang out of his daze. So the house became chaotic. Sister changed her clothes and washed her feet, mother asked about everything... until the house gradually settled down, and the heavy rain outside gradually stopped. In a moment, the rain cleared, and not even a cloud knew where to escape to.

Outside A-liang's house window was a tofu-like patch of grass, hardly worthy of being called a garden. His father often planted various grasses and flowers in the soil. After this heavy rain, they looked greener and more pleasing. Some of the flowers were even more vibrant after the rain. A-liang unconsciously brought his nose close to smell them, and then he seemed to have discovered some kind of miracle. He walked into the house and said to his father,

"Dad, the flowers after the rain are very fragrant, come and smell them! And they smell even better than usual. What is the reason for this?" He asked as he tried to pull his father out to smell them, making his old man wonder whether to answer him or go outside with him.

"Okay, I'll tell you. After a rain, the flowers do smell better and more intense than usual. Now that you've discovered it, your credit is great. But do you know what the reason for this is? You ask very well. The reason for this, roughly speaking, is very simple, but unfortunately our naked eyes can't see it, so it becomes a very difficult question. Most flowers have petals, and the shapes of the petals are different. Each type of flower has its own shape. The petals have many small holes; they all have the ability to open and close, but they are so small that we can't see them. We need to magnify them under a microscope to see their true appearance. In normal times, the air is relatively dry, and the surface of the petals is also relatively tough. The small holes on the petals are mostly closed under this dry climate. This can prevent excessive evaporation of water, which is also a method of saving resources. If those small holes are closed, the fragrant oil in the holes will not easily seep out, but the fragrance of the flower depends entirely on this fragrant oil. If the amount of fragrant oil seeping out is very small, the fragrance will also be very light. However, after it rains, the air becomes humid, and the small holes on the petals all announce that they are open. The fragrant oil flows out continuously, and the fragrance becomes exceptionally rich." After hearing so much, A-liang walked back to that small garden, wanting to discover some new miracles again.

"Why are there grains of soil on the green grass?" A-liang felt that he had only discovered it after the rain, and had never seen it before. He treated it as a miracle. In fact, it is there at any time, but today he was exceptionally careful, so he found it. He even discovered an earthworm under the soil grains. He had already known about earthworms, otherwise he would have considered it another miracle he had discovered. This time his father was dragged out to see the miracle he had discovered. His father said with a smile:

"These soil grains are the excrement excreted by earthworms, because they can only eat soil to survive in the soil. What is excreted is naturally also soil, but some nutrients in the soil have been absorbed by them. After the rain, creatures like earthworms, frogs, and ants all like to crawl onto the ground, which is not often seen at ordinary times. This is because the temperament of earthworms, etc., is that they like humidity and are afraid of dryness. When the ground is not very humid at ordinary times, they hide in humid places underground. Once it rains, the ground also becomes humid, and they all crawl out to breathe some fresh air and regulate their lives. It can be seen that all creatures in nature are extremely smart, and sometimes we humans are not as good as them."

### Fan

— Yang Chunlv

"A fan can generate wind, most useful in summer, can not only ward off the heat but also swat mosquitoes."

During the hot summer, don't we all need to use fans? Waving the fan generates gusts of cool wind, making us feel refreshed all over, exceptionally comfortable.

In ancient times, humans waved tree leaves (1) and feathers (2) to ward off the heat. However, feathers and tree leaves generated very little wind, so clever people used the leaves of the fan palm to make palm-leaf fans (3) and goose and swan feathers to make feather fans (4), which were cool and practical. Later, there were also straw fans (5) made of wheat straw, rattan fans (6) made of vines, and court fans (7) and round fans (8) made of silk or paper, which were more lightweight. However, these fans were not very convenient to carry, so someone invented a folding fan (9) that could be opened and closed, which was very convenient to carry.

Although folding fans are convenient and suitable, their wind power is very small, but they can be used by individuals and cannot cool many people. As for public cooling equipment, at first, a wooden board was hung up to make a wooden board fan (10). Once pulled, it stirred the indoor air and generated a cool breeze. But wooden boards are very bulky, so cloth was used instead to make cloth fans (11). In recent years, after electricity was discovered by humans, electricity has been used to power fans, so that one can get a cool breeze without any effort. The electric fans we use now come in two types: giant wing hanging fans (12) and oscillating desk fans (13). See the image above.

In addition, air-conditioning is the latest cooling method. When air-conditioning is turned on, the whole room is cool and comfortable, which is something the ancients could never have imagined.

### Why Is It Easy to Get a Headache in Crowded Places?

— A-mao

There was an article in the previous issue of Children's Weekly, "Why Is It Easy to Get a Headache in Crowded Places?" Ming'er's father said: This is because the air is polluted. This answer is wrong.

Actually, it is like this: People eat a lot of food every day. After digestion, this food turns into heat. This heat enables us to do things, to walk, to think, to... but this heat will not all become the power of our work properly. The part that is extra must be released (from the pores). This is why we feel hot after doing exercises.

In cinemas or other crowded rooms, the heat released by everyone fills the space, and the air is not circulated. As a result, the temperature in the room increases, and the heat on people's bodies is not easy to release anymore. At this time, we will feel uncomfortable, even to the point of having a headache. (To be continued)

### Come to Reclaim New Territory!

— Sheng Lian Obligation School Ma Yuanguang

Can you study without money to pay tuition or buy books? Why can't you? There are now so many obligation schools. You can find one yourself. I'm just afraid that you are too lazy to study, and you willingly be an unmotivated little devil, turning into a dung-making machine.

We are not studying for the sake of "the only thing that matters is reading books". We are seeking knowledge to be a person of the Republic of China who can stand firm and stand straight. We were born, and we cannot let you carry an empty head on your shoulders.

The mother school held a closing ceremony the day before yesterday and also issued eight certificates to eight students who completed the special grade (first year of junior high school level) courses. They were all smiling when they took the certificates. What were they smiling about? I guess they were smiling because their heads were much heavier and more solid, so they were beaming.

Really, the mother school should be considered my second home. In a year, I didn't spend any money (I paid a deposit, which was returned at the end of the school term), but my head has become much bigger, and my limbs have become much more flexible. (I am in charge of the self-government association library.) The teachers inside teach with authority like Mount Tai. After class, they are more kind than the fathers and brothers at home. This makes me very happy. The mother school will be enrolling students again starting on the 21st. I am telling this news to my fellow students who are struggling to study: As long as you have ambition, don't be afraid of not having books to read. As long as you really want to study, books can be given to you, and the deposit can be waived (but you must find a reliable person to guarantee you). It is best to go with your parents when registering, because the mother school does not accept students casually. The time is in the evening, and the school is located at 186 Baker Road.

I am telling you this news. I think I am very happy, because in the next semester, I will have more "hungry lions" to seek spiritual food and more partners to prepare to open up free territory. (In response to the Shen Bao Scholarship)

### Idle Talk on "The Linked Rings" (Part 1)

— Old Tu

"The Linked Rings" is a "hot play" (meaning intense), including scenes of taking a stronghold, stealing a horse, paying respects to the mountain, comparing martial skills, stealing the golden hook, and confessing guilt. The main characters Huang Tianba, Bao Erdun, and Zhu Guangzu each have significant singing and acting roles, and it's not easy to please the audience.

Generally, Huang Tianba's performance relies on his demeanor, Bao Erdun on his heroic spirit, and Zhu Guangzu on his physical skills to create a perfect synergy and showcase the brilliance of the play.

In the past three years, performances by Northern and Southern actors in Shanghai have been frequent. I am deeply addicted to it. Whenever "The Linked Rings" is staged, I almost never miss a show. Impelled by interest, I will compile my observations and insights on the performers of the three major roles, which I believe will also be welcomed by the readers.

(1) Huang Tianba

Gao Shenglin: Gao Shenglin promotes himself as a "Yang-style martial artist." "The Linked Rings" is, of course, one of his signature plays. Every time he comes south, he has to perform it a few times. His expressions when examining the horse during the mountain visit and his shocked appearance when receiving the imperial order are extremely lifelike and can be called masterpieces. However, some of his poses are too reminiscent of an "old spear," not befitting Huang Tianba's handsome image.

Wu Yanheng: His stage appearance is very good, and his stage movements are even more impressive. The only shortcoming is his unsteady vocal delivery. His dialogue during the mountain visit is much inferior to Gao Shenglin's. However, he understands how to grasp the plot and does not appear scattered as a result. This is where Yanheng's cleverness shines.

Fu Dewei: He follows the style of Shang and Yu, possessing both a dignified and martial presence. His portrayal of Tianba fits the character perfectly, especially excelling in stability. His simple-minded appearance under Zhu Guangzu's command during the arranged martial arts competition is truly divine! Although his voice is a bit too broad, it doesn't feel unpleasant.

Wang Jinlu: Jinlu and Dewei are both outstanding martial artists from the opera school. Jinlu was more prominent during their time at school, but Dewei has surpassed him since graduating. In terms of their skills, each has their strengths. Dewei excels in "Kao" (plays with heavy costumes and armor), while Jinlu is proficient in short combat. Last time I watched him perform "The Linked Rings" with Qiu Shengrong, his spoken lines were very powerful. However, his facial expressions were not responsive enough to the plot. The mountain visit scene felt too immature, and his apology to Zhu Guangzu was too stiff. Both need improvement.

Li Wanchun: Wanchun can also be considered a rising star among martial artists. The problem is that he is too clever for his own good, resulting in something that is neither fish nor fowl. He has adapted "The Linked Rings" into a "complete version," starting from the hunt and ending with Bao Erdun becoming a monk, which is superfluous and makes the whole play lose its focus. As Tianba, he is glib and treats Bao Erdun like a fool, which is really not flattering.

Zhou Xinfang: In recent years, the Carlton Theatre has also frequently staged "The Linked Rings." However, because there is no martial clown, the scene of stealing the hook is omitted. How can an artist of Master Qi's generation play such a role? His performance of Tianba's mountain visit scene is vivid and thorough, not at all inferior to any "Dynastic School" performance. What's jarring is that you always feel that the young Tianba wouldn't be so seasoned, right? Just a laugh.

Ye Shichang: This boy can truly worship Xinfang as his teacher. The breadth of his repertoire is unbelievable for a young man barely over twenty. Last time, Fu Liancheng staged "The Linked Rings" twice at the Golden Theatre, both times with Shichang playing Tianba. He performs it flawlessly, and aside from his voice still carrying the tone of a middle-aged male role, the rest is almost indistinguishable from the original. Good kid, truly remarkable!

### The Ideal Wife: Joan Blondell

— Paul

After Joan Blondell starred with her husband Dick Powell in "Model Wife," Genevieve MacDonald will also star with her husband Gene Raymond in "Smiling Through." In Hollywood, it is not uncommon for married couples to work together. Charles Laughton is one of them.

Because Joan Blondell's parents were stage performers, she grew up entirely in cars and trunks. She spent her first birthday in Paris, and her next twenty-one birthdays were spent in various locations in Europe and the United States, showing her nomadic lifestyle. She went on stage at fourteen months old. Because she has so much experience in acting, she does not waste time while filming, and she can say her lines fluently. She first appeared on the silver screen with James Cagney in "Penny Arcade," and since then, she has filmed many films in Hollywood.

When a husband and wife are both actors, conflicts can arise because sometimes the wife's reputation is several times higher than the husband's. Sometimes the husband's reputation is far greater than the wife's. However, there is no problem for Joan Blondell, because neither she nor her husband became famous overnight. So they have an agreement that after work, they will have a sweet family life and not talk about each other's careers.

### A Scene from "Model Wife"

### Blood Rain, Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 12: Nothing Could Be Done About Ningwu

However, after Zhou Yuji fought for a long time, he saw Zhang Lie shot in the forehead by an arrow and fall to the ground. His heart ached, and two arrows had already hit his arm, making it impossible for him to wield his whip. His father was hit in the thigh by an arrow. Fearing capture and humiliation, he snatched a short knife from a bandit, held it in his left hand, and slashed his own neck. Alas, this heroic warrior who had fought hundreds of battles had exhausted his strength and died a righteous death, leaving a name for eternity in history. When Zhou Yuji and Zhang Lie died in battle, the bandits rushed straight to Zhou Yuji's home. Zhou Yuji's wife, Madam Liu, knew that Ningwu had fallen, the rebel soldiers had entered the city, her husband was surrounded, and the bandits were coming to her home. Unwilling to surrender and await death, she climbed to the roof with the female servants and slaves, took bows and arrows, and shot at the bandits outside the house. Because Madam Liu was also skilled in martial arts and archery, she originally wanted to follow her husband to kill the bandits, but Zhou Yuji wanted her to stay home and protect his elderly mother, so she did not go into battle. Now, with disaster imminent, she couldn't care less and only knew to kill the bandits. She took the lead in drawing her bow and firing, killing one bandit with each arrow. The bandits were furious and set fire to the house. Zhou Yuji's mother had already hanged herself in the room. Madam Liu and her son had no way to escape and continued to lead the women in fighting on the roof. The bandits saw Madam Liu drawing her bow in the firelight, and arrows flying out of the flames one by one. The bandits only shouted outside and did not dare to attack. After a while, the thick smoke grew thicker and thicker, and the whole house was filled with black smoke and raging flames. The terrifying tongues of fire shot up very high, and no more arrows flew out. Madam Liu's shadow also disappeared into the fire. Thus, the entire Zhou family died for their loyalty. The Ming Records Music Department has a poem that says:

Tongguan falls like a broken bamboo, Taiyuan has been captured, Ningwu is in distress, the general

angrily beheads the persuader, vowing to defend the city with eyes wide open, white blades charge into battle

with loud cries, skulls cover the ground, blood is blurred, cannons boom, smoke and dust

are black, the horse falls, but he still fights on foot. The general has a heart like a bucket, the lady

has a heart of iron, angrily bends the wriggling bow, killing one bandit with each arrow. Nothing

can be done about Ningwu? The bandit gang still clicks their tongues in discussion! They plan to return after resting

to the Xianyang Road, and a surrender memorial comes from Datong Yifu. (120)

### British Prime Minister on the Silver Screen

— Wochuan

Warner Company has contacted the British authorities about producing "The Biography of British Prime Minister Churchill." If the British side approves and is willing to help, it will probably be filmed in the UK. Max Miat, Warner's representative in London, said: "In the hearts of people around the world, Churchill is England. A story depicting Churchill's struggle is a propaganda tool with infinite magic!"
