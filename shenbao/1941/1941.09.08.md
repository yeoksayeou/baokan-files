### Tensions Rise Between America and Germany: Roosevelt Scheduled to Broadcast Tonight, Willkie Urges a Decisive Response to Challenges and Armed Protection of Ships to Ensure Unobstructed Navigation

Reuters, New York, 7th—President Roosevelt will deliver a broadcast address from the White House at 9:00 PM on Sunday. Presidential Secretary Hassett did not reveal the nature of the President's address, but stated that it would be of great significance and last about fifteen minutes. It will be translated into four languages and broadcast worldwide via shortwave. When asked if it was related to the incident involving the destroyer USS Greer, Hassett replied that he could not say, and added that he did not believe the President's decision to speak on Sunday was sudden.

Havas, Hyde Park, 7th—President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver an important speech tomorrow evening, expected to strongly assert the US government's determination to ensure that American ships can sail to Iceland without any hindrance. In addition, it will also touch on the Far East issue.

Reuters, New York, 7th—Former Republican presidential candidate Willkie broadcast a message yesterday during a celebration of the birthday of King Peter of Yugoslavia, urging President Roosevelt to confront the challenge posed by barbaric forces to America's maritime freedom with determination and resolve. He stated that in making this statement, he knew he was speaking for the majority of Americans. He hoped that the US President would notify Germany that the United States expects its ships to navigate the North Atlantic freely and without interference, and that any obstruction would receive its due consequences.

Reuters, New York, 7th—The New York Times recently provided a detailed account of the USS Greer incident, stating that Germany has clearly announced that any American warships entering its "combat zone" will be bombarded. We cannot retreat from this threat. The time has come to abolish the various restrictions of the Neutrality Act, arm our ships, and complete their designated missions under naval protection.

Reuters, Washington, 7th—New York newspapers report that President Roosevelt's motivation for deciding to broadcast tomorrow is largely due to the attack on the destroyer USS Greer. The public is widely speculating about the President's upcoming remarks.

Germany Claims US Warship Initiated Bombing; Submarine Launched Torpedo in Retaliation

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 7th—German officials stated last night that the so-called Greer incident was not a German submarine attacking an American destroyer, but rather an American destroyer dropping depth charges on a German submarine within a German blockade zone and pursuing it relentlessly. The German submarine, in exercising its right to legitimate self-defense, fired on the unidentified destroyer but missed. However, the destroyer continued to pursue the German submarine with depth charges. German officials believe that this incident sufficiently proves that Roosevelt has ordered attacks on all German surface and underwater vessels, deliberately provoking disputes. The German communique regarding this incident stated that at 12:30 PM on September 4, 1941, a German submarine at 62 degrees 31 minutes north latitude and 27 degrees 6 minutes west longitude within the German blockade zone was attacked with depth charges by a destroyer and pursued relentlessly. The German submarine could not identify the nationality of the destroyer and, in legitimate self-defense, fired a single torpedo at the warship at 4:39 PM, which did not hit. The destroyer continued its pursuit until midnight. If American officials, such as the US Navy Department, claim that the German submarine attacked the American destroyer first, their aim is solely to absolve the American warship of the responsibility for attacking the German submarine in violation of neutrality. This incident proves that the President has ordered the US fleet to not only immediately report the location of any German vessels encountered but also to immediately fire upon them. Therefore, the US President is attempting to incite anti-German sentiment in American public opinion in order to enter the war.

US Navy Department Issues Statement Refuting German Claims

Reuters, Washington, 7th—The Navy issued the following statement: Although newspapers today carry German claims that the American destroyer USS Greer fired first at the submarine, the truth of the matter is exactly as the Navy Department has stated: the submarine attacked the Greer first, and only then did it retaliate.

Associated Press, Washington, 7th—The Atlantic Fleet was ordered yesterday to use aircraft and warships to search for the submarine that attacked the USS Greer three times and "eliminate" it. Germany accuses the Greer of attacking the submarine first, leading the German side to retaliate. The Navy Department reiterated its original statement that the torpedo, fired without warning, struck the Greer first, and only then did the destroyer retaliate with depth charges. White House Secretary Hassett stated at Hyde Park that there was no need to comment on the German accusation that the Greer had attacked the submarine first, as the source of this accusation speaks for itself. The Navy Department offered no other criticisms, but an official spokesperson drew attention to the original announcement. The statement from Berlin confirmed that the submarine was German and indicated that the Greer and other American destroyers could not "eliminate" the submarine. It is generally believed that the search is continuing.

Reuters, Washington, 7th—Officials here indicate that the German claim that the US destroyer USS Greer deliberately provoked a conflict is absolutely not credible. Senator Connally, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, stated that Germany should know that the United States will defend its ships and its people. Germany's admission that the incident involved a German submarine is tantamount to admitting that the submarine was ordered by the German government to attack the American destroyer. This spirit of assassination, which disregards the rights of other nations, has already brought the United States into the brink of war. We do not wish to participate in the current war, but if our ships or people are attacked, we will certainly defend them. Connally pointed out that the Berlin statement was merely intended to create the impression that the German submarine had not been sunk.

Associated Press, Reykjavik, 7th—The crew of the USS Greer stated yesterday that the German submarine that attacked the American destroyer last Thursday was sunk when the depth charges were deployed. This is not impossible. News from Berlin and Washington, however, indicates that the submarine is safe.

Takahashi Comments on US-German Relations, Believes the US Will Enter the War Sooner

Associated Press, Tokyo, 7th—Admiral Takahashi, formerly Commander of the Combined Fleet, told the "Yomiuri Shimbun" that US participation in the European war is only a matter of time. He also stated that the Greer incident has accelerated the timeline for entering the war. Admiral Takahashi stated that although it is too early to know whether the United States will declare war on Germany, the continuation of such incidents could easily lead to an unwanted war. He also said that Germany lacks a fleet and therefore cannot engage in a large-scale decisive battle against the United States. However, Germany will adopt submarine tactics, which will be effective. He also stated that Germany certainly hopes the United States will engage in open warfare so that Germany can also openly attack merchant ships and warships, sinking them all upon discovery. Takahashi said that what the United States is most worried about now is its relations with Japan and its Pacific military strategy. If war breaks out in the Pacific, it will be very difficult for the United States to fight on both oceans. However, Takahashi acknowledged that the US Atlantic Fleet and the British Fleet are more than capable of dealing with Germany, and the United States can deploy the remaining fleet to fight in the Pacific.

Associated Press, 7th—Japanese newspapers today prominently published news of the attack on the US destroyer USS Greer. Most criticized the US warship for being subjected to such an attack. The Mainichi Shimbun stated that such attacks were to be expected because the Neutrality Act had been repealed, and the Lend-Lease Act had invalidated the cash-and-carry provisions of the Neutrality Act. The newspaper pointed out that regardless of any excuses for further amendments, the loss of ships aiding Britain will have the effect of completely abolishing neutrality. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the US occupation of Iceland is effectively equivalent to abolishing neutrality, and the Greer incident is tantamount to a warship of a belligerent nation being attacked in a war zone. The newspaper stated that the Greer incident occurred because the United States declared neutrality on one hand while also insisting on the rights of a belligerent nation. However, the newspaper pointed out that caution must be taken to prevent such incidents from occurring in the Pacific.

### Japan Remains Focused, Awaiting US President's Reply; US Public Opinion Largely Favors War Against Japan

Reuters, Tokyo, 7th—Tokyo is still focused on awaiting President Roosevelt's reply to Konoe, as this reply will indicate the nature of the negotiations currently underway in Washington. Officials are silent regarding US-Japan talks, stating that the content of Konoe's secret letter to the US President is known only to Konoe and his close aides. US Secretary of State Hull's statement on Friday that the US President's reply would be issued soon was prominently published in newspapers here yesterday. In any case, responsible observers say that there will be concrete developments within this month or in the coming days. A few optimists believe that the current pessimism is merely a smokescreen to conceal the true direction of events, as Japan has many ships available for use, which at least provides a basis for compromise. However, pessimists say that Japan cannot honorably change its adopted course, and the United States cannot agree with Japan's adopted course, so a fundamental solution is impossible.

Havas, Tokyo, 6th—Regarding the news that American ships carrying aviation gasoline have arrived in Vladivostok, Japanese censors have prohibited newspapers from publishing it. According to reliable sources here, some progress has been made in US-Japan negotiations, further proving that Japan does not want to obstruct American supplies from reaching the Soviet Union through Japanese territorial waters in order to avoid causing any incidents that could hinder rapprochement between the two sides. However, the Japanese government is maintaining the policy it decided on in mid-August, namely that Japan will adopt a compromising attitude, but only in exchange for diplomatic concessions from the US and the Soviet Union. The issue of American oil being transported to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok may be discussed together with the overall US-Japan issue in Washington.

Reuters, New York, 7th—The Gallup Poll conducted a public opinion survey, asking the question: "Do you think the United States should now try to prevent Japan from becoming more aggressive, even at the risk of war with Japan?" Now that the survey is complete, the results show that 70% voted yes, 18% voted no, and 12% were undecided.

Associated Press, Washington, 7th—The State Department yesterday formally denied reports from Buenos Aires, Argentina, that the United States had requested Argentina to represent American diplomatic interests in Tokyo in the event of war. The State Department stated that such rumors were baseless because US-Japan relations were clearly not on the verge of collapse.

### Current Situation in Vietnam Under Japanese Control

Reuters, Saigon, 7th—A Vietnamese government official told a Reuters correspondent today that rumors about the strength of Japanese forces in Vietnam, that French troops have been disarmed and confined to barracks under Japanese surveillance, and that the Vietnamese government's authority has been almost completely stripped away are all unfounded. The number of Japanese troops arriving in Vietnam is less than the theoretically stipulated number. Since the first batch arrived, only a few transport ships have docked, and most of what they carry is machinery. Although some French troops have been transferred out, and a joint defense zone has been agreed upon, the French military organization and command remain intact, and civil administration continues as usual. French and Japanese authorities have agreed on some restrictions to protect the interests of both sides and prevent the leakage of important military information. Although minor incidents occasionally occur, the Japanese are currently maintaining very strict discipline.

### Dutch East Indies Actively Training Paratroopers

Reuters, Batavia, 7th—Lockheed aircraft, used as transports capable of carrying 20 airborne soldiers and paratroopers, are currently being used in the Dutch East Indies, and paratroopers are being trained here according to American methods. Military leaders here understand the significant value that paratroopers represent in this decisive war. Although they hope the Dutch East Indies will not have to use such troops, they believe that this equipment is indispensable in the Dutch East Indies' preparations.

Reuters, Batavia, 7th—Five Dutch East Indies government officials will soon depart for the United States and then to England to serve in the Dutch government in London. After arriving in the United States, they will likely fly to London on bombers crossing the Atlantic.

### Japan's Guarantee of Friendship to Thailand; Thai Newspaper Publishes Special Article of Welcome, Hoping Words Match Actions

Reuters, Bangkok, 7th—The "Thai Capital Daily" published an article today welcoming the new Japanese ambassador's guarantee of Japanese friendship to Thailand, but stated that the Japanese ambassador should pay close attention to the behavior of newly arrived Japanese in Thailand, saying that they do not understand the character of the Thai people, and their words and actions harm the feelings of the Thai people. Thailand, for the sake of maintaining friendly relations between Japan and Thailand, has overlooked certain incidents, which will inevitably lead to serious consequences. It is hoped that the Japanese ambassador will strictly instruct newly arrived Japanese to have a better understanding of the Thai people. Thai people are peaceful, gentle, and generous, but will never accept insults.

### China Needs Greater Assistance; Wei Daoming Appeals to the US

Associated Press, New York, 7th—China's new ambassador to Vichy France, Wei Daoming, arrived here yesterday en route to France. He said that the Chinese army is gradually becoming stronger, while the Japanese army is becoming weaker. He also stated, "China is single-handedly supporting the Pacific war. Our victory concerns the future of Asia, America, and Australia." Wei said that the responsibility of the United States is to prevent Japan from choosing the best time to act south or north. He also said that an increasing amount of military supplies are arriving daily to the Chinese army.

Editorial

### The Greer Incident and US-Japan Talks

The situation in the Pacific has made no progress, and a huge wave has risen in the Atlantic due to the bombing of the American destroyer Greer. The US public opinion has been extremely excited for days, and the German government has brazenly admitted this, using the ship's entry into the German blockade zone as a reason for bombardment. Although the ship was not damaged, the serious nature of this issue is clearly beyond comparison to the incidents of the Robin Moor or the Tuila.

The sinking of the Robin Moor by a German submarine in May was largely considered by the world to be intended to force the United States to enter the war. In retrospect, its true intention was more to test the extent of the American reaction in order to judge whether the United States would restrain Germany when the war against the Soviet Union broke out, just as the Japanese army sunk two Soviet gunboats in the Heilongjiang before the "July 7th Incident." After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the international situation changed, and both belligerent and non-belligerent countries were in a delicate state in which pulling one hair would move the whole body. Germany, which is attacking the Soviet Union with all its strength, has not achieved a decisive victory in the past two and a half months, and its eagerness for favorable changes to occur in other corners of the world goes without saying. If the United States and Germany confront each other with weapons, Japan has a legal obligation to provide assistance. In terms of interests, this is a good opportunity for expansion. The trend of events will inevitably lead to close cooperation and mutual assistance with Germany. Germany's decision to deliberately provoke a serious dispute with the United States over the Greer incident is probably exactly this kind of intention.

The reason cited by Germany that the American warship entered the blockade zone is obviously unacceptable to the US authorities and is also contrary to the traditional American policy of advocating maritime freedom. Now the various warships of the US Atlantic Fleet have been ordered to search for the German submarines that caused the incident and destroy them. The reaction from the US government and public will be greater than that of the Robin Moor incident in June. As for how it will decide or retaliate for this incident, President Roosevelt will deliver a "significant" speech tonight. Even if the speech is not made for this temporary incident and may not even explicitly mention it, the occurrence of this issue has undoubtedly deeply affected the spirit and policy of the US government. The direction of its future course is difficult to discern from tonight's speech.

If Germany's intention is indeed as pointed out above, focusing on the future development of US-Japan relations, then the current situation in the Pacific may be the most important factor in determining the future international situation. Regarding the progress of US-Japan talks, the rumors have differed recently. The US authorities have always stated that the talks have made no progress, while news from Tokyo has stated that the negotiations are proceeding smoothly. In this confusing state, it is difficult to discern the truth of the facts. But what can be asserted is that the claim that the negotiations have stalled is still too early, and the claim that they are proceeding smoothly also contains a sense of self-consolation. The Japanese side hopes only for a reduction in economic pressure, while the US side aims at a thorough resolution of political issues. Since the starting points of the two sides are clearly different, the negotiating stances are also very different. Moreover, the Japanese side's fundamental intention may only be to delay time through this, and there is no way to fundamentally resolve this issue. However, despite these differences, the channel for negotiations has never been blocked. The delivery of Konoe's letter to President Roosevelt and the successive safe arrivals of American oil tankers in Vladivostok show that the howling and impatience of Japanese extremists cannot affect the current policy of the Japanese authorities. Although the US government has repeatedly stated that its Far East policy remains unchanged and guarantees that it will no longer appease Japan, it has not abandoned attempts on the diplomatic path. However, this situation of stalemate between the two sides is extremely fragile. Any relevant international changes are sufficient to cause deviations. The outbreak of the Greer incident is probably a move arranged by the Nazis who have taken aim at this situation. The progress of US-Japan talks, even if it has no practical effect, is always a danger to Germany. If a compromise is reached between the United States and Japan, no matter whether Japan is willing to withdraw from the Axis or not, it will always sacrifice Germany's interests to some extent. Moreover, after the United States' security in the Pacific is guaranteed, it will inevitably increase its power to attack the Nazis. Therefore, it is better to risk prompting the United States to enter the war, provoking a dispute between the United States and Germany, in order to indirectly boost Japan's arrogance and make the attempt to compromise between the United States and Japan fail. From the perspective of the Nazis' current situation, only if the United States is under threat from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans for a long time, and even has to fight on both fronts, is the most favorable ideal state for Germany.

The current situation is indeed difficult for the United States to deal with, but the European situation has the support of Britain and the Soviet Union, and the Nazis' maritime power is insufficient to deal with Britain, and the Far East has the strong ABCD defense line. In terms of responding to changes, there is also more than enough leeway. In fact, the United States does not need to feel anxious. At present, the Atlantic is tense again due to the activities of German submarines, but the center of the international situation is still in the Pacific. If the Far East is thoroughly clarified, the resolution of the European situation will also reduce major constraints and difficulties. The US-Japan talks are simply wasting time and doing nothing to help. Germany's threat to the United States at this time is a serious lesson that the United States should pay attention to.

### Zhongshan University Professor Luo Xianglin Discovers Sun Yat-sen's Family Genealogy; Ancestors Originally Lived in Bianliang and Chenzhou; Moved to Guangdong During the Yuan and Ming Dynasties

Guilin—From Sun Yat-sen's twelfth-generation ancestor Su Changgong to Sun Yat-sen, there were eleven generations. The ancestral birth and death records kept in Sun Yat-sen's hometown in Zhongshan County did not record anything before Su Changgong due to repeated migrations. Luo Xianglin, a professor at Zhongshan University, has been researching the origins of surnames for many years. He once discovered Sun Yat-sen's upper-generation genealogy in Dongjiang, Guangdong. The generations, names, and deeds from Sun Yat-sen's first ancestor to the twelfth-generation ancestor Lian Changgong are very clear, which is enough to prove that Sun Yat-sen's upper generations originally lived in Bianliang and Chenzhou before the Tang Dynasty. During the reign of Emperor Xizong of the Tang Dynasty, he was selected to live in Ningdu, Jiangxi, for leading troops to quell the Huang Chao rebellion. During the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, he was again selected to live in Guangdong. After the Manchus entered the Pass, he once resisted Qing soldiers in the countryside with Zhong Dingsheng of the same village. After the defeat, he dispersed the strong men who had surrendered. During the Kangxi period, he migrated to Yongkou, Zhongshan, for land reclamation. Several generations later, he moved to Cuiheng Township. Each decision to migrate was related to the changes of the times. It is reported that Mr. Luo discovered this valuable information and, at the same time, consulted various books and mutually authenticated them before obtaining this clear clue. He is now writing a special book to promote the origin of Sun Yat-sen's family, so that those who study the history of the party and the country can have a reference. (6th Dispatch)

### U.S. Secretary of Security McNutt Publishes Article: China Will Surely Win; Heroic Combat Known Worldwide; International Aid Greater Than Before

New Aviation News: U.S. Secretary of Security McNutt published an article in the August issue of the New Aviation English China Monthly, titled "The Inevitable Victory of China." The gist of the article is that the heroic combat of China is now widely understood throughout the world. The aid that China receives from democratic countries around the world is also greater than before. Several years ago, there was a period when the world did not feel concerned about the issues of China, Austria, Abyssinia, or Czechoslovakia. For example, although people generally detested the creation of Manchukuo, they did not consider it (our business). However, those with foresight felt that the rights and interests of any country are related to the freedom, sovereignty, integrity, and goodwill of the people of other countries. Unfortunately, the world recognized this fact too late, so it is now more difficult to restore the previous order. I believe that the United States has the honor of taking action in the world, and I believe that maintaining this honor is our duty. Before I went to Manila (McNutt served as the High Commissioner to the Philippines from 1933 to 1939), and after taking office, I closely adhered to the government's policy on the Far East issue. The relationship between the United States and the Far East must not be abandoned to appease the political tools currently in power in Tokyo. Seventeen types of raw material necessities for our national defense strategy come from the Far East. The United States must not allow any country to monopolize and restrict our use. McNutt also said that in order to maintain the common destiny of free people around the world, we should stand with China today. The Pacific issue urgently needs to be resolved. After this issue is resolved, not only will the issues of China and Vietnam be resolved, but also the Japanese civilians who have long been in pain will gain new freedom. The time for action has arrived. The changes in the situation increasingly prove the necessity of action. It has now brought us into a new union. The United States and China must each assume the responsibility of destroying the violence that destroys free people around the world. Victory will surely come. China, in this victory, will lead the Far East. From the great past, we dare to assert that what will arise in its place must be an era of wise and upright governance. China, the British Empire, the Americas, and other free nations will be able to rebuild a standard for the world. Under this standard, wisdom and glory will surely be repeated. In addition, those who published in the magazine also include General Yan Luer's "(Defensive Lifeline)," Representative Kaufer's "Oil Embargo on Japan," Minister Weng Wenhao's "Sino-Japanese Economic War," Senator Kripinger's "Who are Japan's Allies?" and other papers, all of which are very valuable. The full text of Chairman Chiang's "Letter to Friendly Nations" has been published, which is receiving great attention from Americans, because American newspapers generally only carry the telegrams of the day, and the content is brief and cannot give a complete picture. In order to facilitate Americans' collection of important international and Far East documents, this publication's mission is extremely important (7th dispatch).

### German-Finnish Allied Forces Reinforce: Siege of Leningrad Intensifies; Soviet Garrison Vows to Defend City to the Death; No German Progress on Central Front

Havas Agency, 6th Dispatch from a certain location on the Soviet border: Seventy-seven days have passed since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. The fighting in the Leningrad area is intensifying. The German army has repeatedly reinforced the siege of the city, and the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. However, General Voroshilov, commander of the Northern Red Army, is determined to defend the city to the death. In recent days, German heavy artillery and aircraft have continuously bombarded the city in an attempt to discourage the garrison. At the same time, Finnish troops have also approached the city and seem unwilling to abandon the war and make peace. The situation on the southern front at the port of Odessa is also the same. The Red Army is determined to extract a heavy price from the enemy before abandoning the port. The Romanian army's strength is not very strong, but it has received reinforcements from Italian troops, increasing its momentum slightly. However, on the central front, the German army has not made good progress. The two sides are still fighting in the areas of Gomel, Smolensk, and Bryansk. According to German war reports, the Red Army has suffered heavy losses, similar to the "annihilation war" that occurred in the areas of Bialystok and Minsk. In addition, the situation in the Dnieper River basin has not changed. According to Soviet sources, the German army's repeated attempts to cross the river have failed.

Reuters, 7th Dispatch from London: The Eastern Front war has reached its twelfth week. The intensity of the war in the Leningrad area has increased. Moscow news reports that last night Soviet troops drove German troops out of a certain village south of Leningrad. The German side claims to have occupied a station on the old Finnish border north of Leningrad. German radio reports admit that some traffic between Leningrad and the west has not yet been cut off, and that German troops along the Gulf of Finland have been continuously bombarded by Soviet ships. A German spokesman could not confirm the claim in Berlin newspapers that at least one part of the outer defenses of Leningrad had been breached, only stating that the city was under continuous artillery fire.

United Press, 7th Dispatch from Berlin: An authoritative German military spokesman announced last night that German and Finnish troops are intensifying their encirclement of Leningrad and have cut off all important railway and highway traffic between the city and the outside world. Soviet troops are now laying landmines in an attempt to prevent German troops from advancing through the swamps and fields around Leningrad. According to news received in Berlin, engineers from a German unit removed more than 2,000 landmines in a 75-mile advance. Soviet troops also destroyed roads every few hundred yards and placed artillery and tanks on small patches of hard ground in the swamps, making it almost impossible for German troops to reach. Another obstacle hindering the German advance is that Soviet snipers often harass German troops from the rear.

United Press, 10th Dispatch from Helsinki: Yesterday's Finnish news from the front said that the situation in Leningrad is extremely chaotic. German and Finnish troops are pressing toward the city with a fierce pincer offensive. The news stated that the dense smoke of the fire could be seen. At the same time, Berlin radio reported that German heavy artillery had successfully bombarded Leningrad's power plants and munitions factories.

United Press, 7th Dispatch from London: Well-informed sources in the United Kingdom stated last night that the battle of Leningrad has not changed significantly in the past 24 hours. Although the weather has been extremely bad in the past week, the war continues to unfold. These sources expressed skepticism about German reports that the city was under heavy artillery bombardment, believing that the Germans would not have enough time to excavate and construct positions for heavy artillery, as was done along the occupied areas of the English Channel. British experts suspect that the German army will attempt to bypass Leningrad, as there is a danger of leaving a strong fortress threatening its flanks.

United Press, 7th Dispatch from Moscow: According to news from the front yesterday, the Soviet Red Army gained the upper hand in the two areas of Kiev and the Dnieper River front. Fierce fighting continues to occur around the roads leading to Leningrad.

Reuters, Dispatch from Moscow: A Soviet communiqué released at midnight stated that yesterday, German motorized troops, infantry, and artillery were heavily attacked by the Soviet Air Force on the battlefield, and enemy aircraft were also destroyed on the airfield. Yesterday, Soviet troops fought fiercely with enemy troops along the entire line. According to accurate figures, 56 German aircraft were shot down on September 3, which corrects the previous inaccurate report of 33 aircraft. On September 4, a total of 61 German aircraft were shot down during aerial combat and attacks on enemy airfields. Seven Soviet aircraft were lost.

Red Army Launches Courageous Counteroffensive Along the Entire Front: German Side Suffers Heavy Losses

Reuters, 7th Dispatch from Moscow: A Soviet supplementary communiqué stated that on September 4, Soviet troops killed more than 15,000 German officers and soldiers along the entire line and destroyed more than 100 artillery pieces of various calibers, 34 machine gun nests, 40 mortar launchers, 18 pontoon and landing docks, 940 vehicles, and 180 tanks and armored vehicles. German troops in the central zone of the front also suffered heavy losses. In this area, Soviet troops launched an attack, destroying 22 fortifications, 8 flat-trajectory artillery teams, 12 machine guns, and 5 mortar launchers, killing 800 German officers and soldiers, and capturing many boxes of artillery shells and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. In another area of the central front, a Soviet unit defeated three companies of enemy infantry and destroyed or captured 12 machine guns, 2 tanks, and 18 mortar launchers.

Residents of Odessa Calm: Defense Line Approximately Seven Miles from the City

Reuters, 7th Dispatch from London: According to a Soviet general who recently returned to Moscow from Odessa, the defense line of Odessa is currently approximately seven miles from the city, forming an irregular semicircle. Streetcars, buses, and trucks in the city continue to operate as usual, and newspapers are still being published.

TASS, 7th Dispatch from Moscow: The attempt by fascists to break through the defenses of Odessa has been completely shattered by the unwavering strength of the city's heroic defenders. A naval unit, with the assistance of our artillery fire, launched two attacks on an enemy infantry division. As a result of the fierce fighting, the elite troops of the enemy division were defeated. The German-Romanian forces' attack on Odessa has suffered huge losses in both manpower and materiel.

Reports of British Aircraft Appearing Over Soviet Airspace: Blackshirts Open Eastern Front to Aid the War

Reuters, 7th Dispatch from Rome: Rome Radio announced last night that British aircraft are currently being used in the fighting around Leningrad.

Reuters, 7th Dispatch from Zurich: News from Rome states that some of the Italian mechanized units inspected by Mussolini yesterday in central Italy will be sent to the Eastern Front. It is said that when Mussolini recently met with Hitler at his headquarters, he promised to add these troops to the Soviet front.

Reuters, 7th Dispatch from London: Roman radio reports have reported that British aircraft were among the aircraft shot down by the German side, but this has not yet been confirmed.

Havas Agency, 7th Dispatch from Rome: Mussolini's spokesman, Gaida, published an article in the Italian People's Voice today, stating that Germany's operations on the Eastern Front originally did not intend to occupy the entire Soviet Union, but only planned to attack the European part of the Soviet Union, occupy important areas, and then stop when appropriate. These important areas should include the cities of Leningrad, Moscow, Kiev, and Kharkov. It is absolutely impossible for the Soviet Union to resist until 1942.

### Moscow Conference: Nature Extremely Important; Far East Issues Also on Agenda; British and American Full Support for Soviet Union Agreement

Reuters, 7th Dispatch from London: The "Observer" diplomatic correspondent claims that the aid issue is only one item on the great agenda of the British and American mission to Moscow. The entire issue of the Far East battlefield is likely to be included. It is reported that the US-Japan talks have stalled, and the distance to the "negotiation stage is still very far. It is generally believed that Japan will inevitably take some retaliatory action against the arrival of American oil tankers in Vladivostok. British, American, and Soviet discussions will be held on a complete military plan to counter Japan's possible war with the United States in the Far East. In short, this Moscow conference is bound to become one of the most important stages in the war.

United Press, 7th Dispatch from Washington: Authoritative circles announced yesterday that the United Kingdom and the United States hope to discuss providing large-scale assistance to the Soviet Union at the upcoming Moscow conference, even if it means reducing their own military equipment. It is understood that the two countries have drafted an agreement to provide the Soviet Union with more assistance than previously planned, because the Red Army's strong resistance is satisfactory. It is widely believed that the two governments have agreed that aiding the Soviet Union is currently the best way to defeat Germany. Well-informed sources claim that the Soviet Union's resistance has caused significant damage to Germany's manpower and resources. It is widely believed that the Soviet Union's resistance can last at least until the winter is over. Officials also said that although the German army has suffered 1.5 million casualties, it is widely believed that the British and American missions have a detailed plan for the maximum amount of aid to the Soviet Union, promising to immediately ship goods to the Soviet Union.

### British War Expenditure Huge: £12.5 Million Needed Daily; Chancellor of the Exchequer Encourages National Economy and Savings

Reuters, 7th Dispatch from Edinburgh: British Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood spoke here yesterday, especially on providing all possible financial assistance to the Soviet Union, stating that the Soviet side had stated that it did not want gratuitous financial aid, but requested credit loans. The United Kingdom has gladly agreed to this without restrictions. The United Kingdom is still able to support huge war expenditures. He believes that the United Kingdom can get through this fiscal year without raising taxes. The people must automatically make greater savings. The United Kingdom has spent £12.5 million daily in the past few weeks, of which £10.5 million was used for the war. We are willing to shoulder extremely heavy financial burdens, not only for ourselves but also for the common cause of freedom and justice. The people of other countries who voluntarily bear extremely heavy consumption taxes are not as numerous as the British. The British Empire also makes financial contributions. The autonomous territories and India have made great sacrifices, and the colonies have also generously contributed. He is deeply grateful. This year, the people must allocate their real savings to lend 200 million pounds to the country. In this war situation, the worst thing besides defeatism is leisure. We must redouble our efforts to increase the savings of the people.

### American Flying Fortress: Mass Production

Reuters, 7th Dispatch from Washington: The newly built B-7E four-engine bomber will be mass-produced in the United States for use by the United Kingdom. It will be an improved flying fortress with a larger fuselage.

Gun turrets are placed above and below the fuselage, and there is also one at the tail, in order to defend against attacks from any direction. The Department of War also stated that there are four bomber command groups in the War Command of the Army Air Corps, which are the backbone of the air force. The Department of War continued to say that the aircraft ordered from the Boeing Aircraft Manufacturing Plant in Seattle and the Douglas Aircraft Manufacturing Plant in Santa Monica, California, totaled $347,156,000, including the new flying fortress, which is estimated to be worth more than $300,000 each.

### Important Oil Wells in Iraqi Territory: All Under British Military Control; British and Soviet Conditions Not Released; Causing Anxiety Among the Iranian People; Iranian Government Considering the Issue of Dealing with German Nationals

Reuters, 7th Dispatch from Tehran: A Reuters special correspondent claims that after British troops entered the town of Sudan Bad, all important oil wells within Iranian territory have been placed under British protection. Sudan Bad is located on the railway line across Persia. The British occupation has, in effect, gained a control point on this major transportation line between the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf. One German technician was arrested when British troops entered, and three other German nationals have fled to Isfahan. At the same time, the delay in the release of the terms of British and Soviet occupation has caused anxiety among the Iranian people. The Iranians' sincere welcome of the British troops was largely based on the hope of universal reform in the near future. However, the British promise not to interfere in internal affairs has made Iran responsible for all reforms, which may be difficult to achieve under the current political structure. Therefore, it is generally hoped that the conditions proposed by the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union will promote the realization of reform. Another result of the delay in the release of the British and Soviet conditions is that the Germans in Iran are becoming increasingly emboldened. The German nationals under surveillance by the Iranian police are now openly appearing in the streets. The leader of the Nazi spies in Tehran appeared on the market for the first time on Saturday. The reply handed over by the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union to the Iranian government on Friday afternoon was studied by the Iranian government yesterday morning. The parliament may declare something on this matter when it convenes today.

Reuters, 7th Dispatch from Tehran: It is widely believed that the issue of dealing with German nationals in Iran is still under consideration. It is reported that the Iranian government, fearing future retaliation and considering that Germans and many Iranian dignitaries have good feelings for each other, is unwilling to ignore this matter.

### Prohibition of Imports and the Black Market

— Wang Haibo

The impact of import prohibitions on the Shanghai commodity market has been detailed in my previous writings. Now, what about the impact on the city's financial market? This can be discussed based on the sources of the prohibited items: these banned imports mainly come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the customs districts of Northeast China. Such as silk and rayon fabrics, woolen cloth and its products, seafood, fruits, dried fruits, candies, sugar for food, foreign liquor, beverages, tobacco, paper, fur, bone, horn, wood and bamboo mats, porcelain, glassware, musical instruments, toys, cosmetics, umbrellas, and so on. The prohibition of these imports in China is enough to adjust the international balance of payments, enough to promote domestic industries, enough to improve social customs and restore the beauty of frugality; in Japan, it will affect its export industries. This is the economic warfare aspect of the import prohibition policy. The most important thing to pay attention to in import and export trade policy is not the future supply and demand of prohibited goods, but the impact that the exchange market may have after the strict implementation of import prohibitions. Because the fluctuation of the exchange market is the fluctuation of the entire price market. The fluctuation of the entire price market is enough to hinder the country's financial stability and disrupt the security of the entire national economy.

The nine banks specifically authorized by the Exchange Stabilization Fund to handle future exchange supply and demand matters are assumed to be able to absolutely refuse to supply the demand for exchange bills for these prohibited import items. In this case, our country's legitimate foreign exchange market will invisibly reduce the burden of such import needs, such as the huge amount of over 230 million yuan in the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938). That is, on the supply side, it invisibly increases foreign exchange resources by more than 230 million yuan. It can be known that this is absolutely beneficial to stabilizing the exchange rate.

Prohibition of Imports and the Black Market Wang Haibo

However, most of our country's import and export ports and their customs are currently in Japanese-occupied areas. Therefore, it is feared that the customs in various places will not be able to enforce this prohibition and prevent the import of these banned items. If foreign exchange control is effective and the black market is indeed eliminated, then even if unscrupulous merchants try to continue importing these items, they will not be able to achieve their goal because they cannot obtain foreign exchange for imports. However, the export of local products from the occupied areas is mostly in the hands of the Japanese. At this time, it is not difficult for Japanese merchants to export Chinese products in exchange for these prohibited imported goods for sale in China. These commodity markets are being affected by the import prohibition, and speculators are raising prices. In this case, Japanese merchants operating in this area will reap even greater profits. This is still what most people worry about regarding the future of the current import prohibition trade policy.

This concern is reasonable. However, we believe that for the current implementation of the import prohibition,

Assuming that in addition to the legitimate exchange market supplied by the Exchange Stabilization Fund, there is also an illegal black market. Then the demand for exchange bills for these prohibited imports will inevitably flock to this black market. As a result, the exchange rate in the black market will definitely be lower than the legal supply market rate under the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Assuming that most of the legal imports at this time have been satisfied by the legal supply market under the Exchange Stabilization Fund, but a small part that is not approved for supply may also turn to this black market. Therefore, although the pressure on the black market has been lighter than in the past, it is still significant. As a result, it is still extremely difficult to maintain the black market's low exchange rate. This is another area where the general public still has concerns about the future of the exchange market. However, this concern is still stuck in the rut of knowing only one thing and not the other. Let's analyze it.

(1) Assuming that the black market can still exist, and the black exchange rate must be lower than the supply exchange rate in the legal market. Then all export exchange bills that are beyond the reach of the Exchange Stabilization Fund will inevitably go to the black market, forming a source of supply in the black market. And all the import needs that were originally supplied by the black market will now be largely supplied by the legal market; as far as the black market is concerned, it has undoubtedly reduced its burden. Therefore, the maintenance of the black market exchange rate may actually be possible even in the market for legal supply.

(2) Assuming that the price of all imported goods supplied legally in the future is definitely more expensive than before according to the shelf of the exchange bills that should be settled for them, it will be greatly affected in its sales market. For this reason, it is enough to make importers prefer to wait for the supply of the legal exchange market for legal import trade, rather than get involved in the black market. Then the pressure on the black market can be further reduced. However, if the price of imported goods settled in the legal exchange market is not managed, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not be sold at the same price as the price of imported goods settled in the black market; in this case, the effect of legal supply of exchange to stabilize prices will disappear invisibly.

Based on these two points, the exchange rate in the black market can still be naturally maintained. The problem lies in the legally supplied market. First, the export exchange bill resources will be taken away by the black market, causing the legally supplied market to fall into a predicament of having supply but no one to buy. Second, the expensive import prices formed by the black market exchange rate are enough to induce the illegal increase of the cheaper import prices formed by the legal exchange rate, thereby making the significance of exchange control disappear. To solve these two major shortcomings, the elimination of the black market is indeed an indispensable condition.

In fact, to reduce Shanghai's black market, it is only necessary for the United States and Britain to implement their laws on freezing Chinese funds. That is, in the future, all foreign exchange not supplied by the designated banks under the Exchange Stabilization Fund will not be given legal protection and effectiveness. In this case, the right to supply all exchange bills can be absolutely concentrated under the power of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. As a result, all possible sales of export exchange bills, that is, the exchange market under the power of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, has no other. Therefore, it is undoubtedly reduced without eliminating the black market itself. The import of non-urgent, non-essential, and even luxury goods can also be completely prohibited.

### Trade and Currency

— Zhu Ruofu

Problems that Cannot Be Ignored

The issue of the legal tender (fapi) is still the most concerned topic in street gossip, but few people have openly discussed it in recent months. This silence will only make the public's understanding of this issue more confusing; it will only make the opinions of those who decide this issue more narrow and stubborn; however, this is by no means a cause for celebration.

How can a country's currency issue only affect the prosperity or decline of the entire national economy? The economies of other countries that have trade relations with it are also closely related. Therefore, any currency change in a country will not only affect the people and economy of the country concerned, but also affect other trading partners. Moreover, the deeper the trade relationship, the greater the impact. In this Sino-Japanese War, in which international trade plays a decisive role in the war economy, the complexity of the currency issue is not unexpected.

Although the US freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds is not thorough, it has, after all, pushed the currency war centered on legal tender into a decisive new era. Precisely because the freezing measures are not thorough, its flexibility is particularly great. This era can be said to be a critical moment of waiting for reason to return.

The Trade Status of the Yen

The importance of currency status in China's war economy is less than that of Japan. At present, Japan is still able to maintain considerable trade relations with democratic countries, entirely relying on the pursuit of profit by individuals in the free economic system of democratic countries. Profit is measured by currency. If Japan's monetary system is chaotic, it will be impossible to maintain foreign trade relations. If the UK and the US strictly enforce the fund freezing order, then British and American merchants will no longer have the possibility of pursuing profits, and it will make the yen completely unable to gain a foothold in the international exchange market: at this time, Japan's last bit of sustaining power for foreign trade will also disappear, unless it uses its military force to control the overseas markets it needs, but this hope is very small.

As for China, it is different. China's foreign trade is not only built on the individual economic desire for profit, but also built on the political needs of both countries involved. Therefore, China's currency has friendly allies in the international exchange market, and at the same time, it has political needs for mutual exchange in the international commodity market. In other words: China's foreign trade relies on the mutual individual economic desires of both parties, and also has the overall national desires of both parties as its background. Japan only has the former. Therefore, once the Pacific War breaks out, the possibility of Japan's foreign trade will be limited to a very small area; the status of legal tender in foreign trade will remain unchanged. Shipping conditions, although absolutely important in China's future foreign trade, are less of a problem in Japan. But under the major premise of politics, the situation will also be the opposite of the current situation. Just as the US, due to its alignment of interests with the Soviet Union in the Soviet-German War, not only provided gasoline to the Soviet Union, but also braved all dangers to supply the 8,428-ton tanker "United," sailing to Vladivostok. Although Japan has some ocean-going ships, on the day the United States announced the freezing of Japanese assets, the Japanese cargo ship Tatsuta Maru, although it had approached San Francisco, had to turn back and drift on the ocean surface for several days, daring not

These are the two fundamentally different basic situations in the future Pacific War regarding the foreign trade possibilities of China and Japan. At the same time, it is also enough to reflect the different fates of legal tender and yen in the future Pacific War. A currency that cannot fulfill its function as a medium in international trade fundamentally loses its value as a currency.

The Trade Status of Legal Tender

In the future Pacific War, the yen will be forced to withdraw from its role as a medium in foreign trade; the status of legal tender will remain unchanged. The Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun published an article after the United States announced the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds, roughly saying: If the Pacific War breaks out, Shanghai will be like Switzerland in the European War, becoming a center for the exchange of materials between the Axis and the Democrats. At that time, the Shanghai market will not only not decline, but will prosper, and the sustaining power of this prosperity is due to the role of legal tender in facilitating it. Because only legal tender has international currency qualifications at that time, the value of legal tender will not only not decrease, but will increase more and more. Whether this observation is right or wrong depends on whether cargo ships can still sail to Shanghai at that time? But if cargo ships can continue to come, then without a doubt, only legal tender is competent as a medium in international trade. In other words: if legal tender ceases its function as a medium in international trade in Shanghai, then Shanghai's foreign trade will definitely plummet; even if there is no war in the Pacific, there may be no way to recover it.

In order to prevent Japan from using legal tender to purchase foreign exchange, China is currently promoting a trade management system in Shanghai. The Exchange Stabilization Fund handles the supply of all foreign exchange in Shanghai, and those trade management regulations that are beneficial to China's wartime economy regarding prohibited and permitted imports are used as the standard for foreign exchange supply and refusal. Therefore, the free function of legal tender to purchase foreign exchange has already been restricted. As a result, those who hold legal tender are just like those who hold British pounds in the United States. Although they cannot freely purchase goods overseas with British pounds, the international value of all their British pounds is not lost. On the contrary, once trade is managed, the international balance of payments can be adjusted; the exchange control effect can stabilize the exchange rate of the currency to a considerable extent. Obviously, this is to make the wealth of legal tender holders even more guaranteed.

### The Outlook for Shanghai Trade John Ahlers

— Written by Su Ru Translation

The coming autumn will be a difficult time for the economy and finance of the Far East. Will Japan risk an open war with the United States and Britain to try to occupy another territory? If not, will she continue to offend and threaten democratic countries, risking the danger of greater economic and financial retaliation, such as the democratic front prohibiting all economic exchanges with all places within Japan's sphere of influence? If none of these situations materialize, then how will the future Far East continue to trade with the rest of the world? And how will the very serious food problem be resolved?

There are often some—even now there are still some dreamers among Shanghai's big merchants who hope that Shanghai's commerce will continue as usual when the US and Japan go to war. They believe that the assets of Japanese residents in Shanghai are so huge that they can become a constraint on military action. They quote a famous Japanese merchant as saying: "Japan absolutely does not need 'another Zhabei, only broken walls.'" However, those who harbor this hope ignore the point that if the Pacific War breaks out, it will isolate Shanghai from the sphere of influence of the United States and Britain; the Japanese will therefore lose all their interests, and this interest once kept a powerful faction among the Japanese who were happy to maintain the city's international trade, just like the current semi-state.

To think that even though the Japanese and American naval and air forces are fighting in the Pacific, the British and American expatriates in Shanghai will still be allowed to reside here and conduct daily trade under the nose of the Japanese is completely delusional. The outbreak of war between Japan and the United States will undoubtedly result in the immediate seizure and liquidation of all enemy property and businesses within Japan's sphere of influence—including Shanghai. An open war will end all economic and financial plans of nationals of democratic countries in the hands of the Japanese. Because they will have nothing and no one to do business with anymore. They will probably be in Japanese concentration camps. There is no need to have any doubts about this.

If an open war between Japan and the United States does not break out soon, then Western business in this port or other places under Japanese influence may still tend to "paralysis." If the democratic countries' retaliation against Japan is not an open war, it will be an economic and financial war. In this regard, the capabilities and opportunities of democratic countries have not been completely exhausted. Although the freezing and control of trade against Japan has been completed, the licensed trade still allows the maintenance of the actual trade between the British, American, Dutch, Indian, and Far East Axis regions under this strategy that is only formally prohibited.

However, the continuation of this licensed trade is not obtained based on any articles or agreements, nor is there any diplomatic guarantee. If Japan makes another mistake and another mistake, then this licensed trade can be suspended at any time. Before the situation evolves into an open war, it may reach an intermediate stage, that is, completely sever all economic relations with Japan.

Only if Japan begins to act somewhat more rationally than in the past will the UK, the US, and the Dutch East Indies have the opportunity to take some steps under the current freezing and embargo regulations to allow limited continuation of trade with various places within Japan's sphere of influence. But even this approach would be very difficult. The opinions of the democratic countries and Japan on this trade are fundamentally different. Obviously, the former does not want to supply Japan with goods that can be used for combat and help Japan complete its armaments. And Japan's intention is equally clear: it wants to take more exports from Japanese-occupied areas in exchange for war supplies. These two completely opposite concepts are almost in conflict; if some agreement can be reached, then the inability to satisfy both parties at the same time may shrink trade to a smaller extent than is now hoped for under the new freeze and embargo.

The weather conditions in the Far East in recent weeks will determine the trade in the Far East in the coming months. Food is now the most important commodity in the Far East trade structure. The import and export situation of rice in 1941-42 has a great impact on all other aspects of trade. The weather conditions at this time of year have a decisive effect on the grain harvest, especially the rice harvest, which is extremely important for the economies of Japan, Korea, Central China, South China, and French Indochina.

Japanese officials expect this year's rice production to be 5% lower than last year, and Korea is normal, but it is still too early to determine the final harvest. The recent typhoons have caused heavy damage to Japanese crops, which the government's harvest forecasters did not expect. If Japan and Korea have a shortfall of 1,500,000 tons of rice, Tokyo will continue to ask the Yangtze River basin and Vietnam for rice supplies; on the other hand, if Japan's need to import rice decreases, the various places in the Far East will immediately feel the easing of Japan's control over rice. If Japan's harvest is satisfactory, the people under Japanese rule will be able to eat more relatively cheap food, Tokyo's distribution system can also be relaxed slightly, and the difficulties of navigation can also be slightly alleviated.

The sufficient supply of cargo ships is also a major problem in the Far East. The restrictions on ships coming and going through the United States have gradually increased, but recently, this has only sometimes delayed the time of cargo transportation and has not reduced the amount of cargo stranded. On the other hand, the freight of cotton and coal coming here from India has decreased greatly in the past few months, and sometimes it is temporarily interrupted.

Since the First World War, maritime shipping in the Far East has never been more dependent on Japan than it is now; Japan's commercial shipping is reduced by the mobilization of ships by the navy for military use. Currently, about one-third of Japan's commercial ships are carrying military supplies in China and Vietnam. The British are continuing to withdraw merchant ships from the Far East, and the United States' shipping is only expanding southward to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. It also seems not impossible for the United States to stop shipping to Shanghai early.

The general outlook, of course, does not fail to cause people to have doubts. A public economic war between Japan and Britain and America may be avoided. Many economic and financial problems can be solved with economic and financial methods; but even the best solutions will ultimately be ineffective if the warmongers in Tokyo prevail.

### Amidst Shortage of Fractional Currency, British-Owned Public Bus Company Reissues Five-Cent Substitute Coupons

Recently, there has been a shortage of one-yuan banknotes and one-cent, five-cent, dime, and two-dime subsidiary currency notes, causing inconvenience for change-making in various industries. It is heard that hospital banknotes are being sold at a premium of about eight to nine yuan per thousand yuan, and dime notes are only exchanged for ninety-five cents per yuan. In order to facilitate passengers, the British-owned Public Bus Company has specially converted the previously printed green two-cent substitute coupons into five-cent coupons for circulation on vehicles. The effective period of the coupons is until the end of December this year. ( )

### Overseas Cotton Market Firm and Bullish

The New York cotton market is firm and active, rising due to purchases by the industry and the good spot market. As a result, both futures and spot prices rose by eight to fifteen points per pound respectively compared with the previous day.

The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to purchases by European exporters and spot traders, then fell slightly due to sales by professional brokers, and finally rose again due to purchases by the public. As a result, all brands rose by one to five rupees and twenty-five points respectively compared with the previous day.

Also, the opening forecast for Indian cotton today is that various stocks will continue to rise by 0.75 rupees.

### Hardware Transactions Sluggish

Recently, transactions in hardware have been sluggish because the source of overseas supplies has been cut off, and merchants from the north, such as Qingdao, Yantai, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Yangtze River Road, and inland river merchants, have been prohibited from exporting. There is nothing to say about destocking, so the market atmosphere is difficult to see lively. And the street sales in this port are also very sluggish, so the number of transactions is few throughout the day. At present, the spot goods on the market, such as foreign nails, are being sold out in large quantities because the hoarding merchants are eager to sell them, resulting in a large number of circulating goods and difficulty in raising prices. And the acceptance by users is very minimal, so those who hold goods have softened their minds. Yesterday, double nails were rarely seen opening at around 185 yuan per barrel. In addition, guild iron, plain white iron, foreign ingot heads, tinplate, and black iron billets are also very sluggish in transactions.

### Excusing Insufficient Costs, Soap Prices Rise Again

The soap market is trending firm again because the Arrow Knife Soap Company has raised its prices again, claiming that the raw materials and products are not enough to cover the costs, so the factory has no goods to distribute, causing those who hold goods to raise their prices again, and people's minds are showing firmness and bullishness again, causing the market to prosper. It is estimated that Solid Brand soap is 64 yuan per case, Bai Xiangmao soap is 53 yuan, and Huang Xiang soap is 49.6 yuan, all up two yuan from the previous day.

### Hangzhou Persimmons Hit the Market, Elegant Pears Flood In and Prices Drop, Florida Tangerines Still Expensive

Since the beginning of autumn, fresh fruits and seasonal products, and various kinds of pears, have been launched on the market one after another. More than 2,000 pieces of Tianjin elegant pears and falling pears have been newly shipped by train, and the selling price is easing. The opening price of elegant pears is 70 yuan per 100 catties, and the falling pears are 50 yuan. There are also Yantai foreign pears with a price of 100 yuan. Yantai apples have also been shipped. New apples (tree-wrapped) are 100 yuan to 80 yuan per 100 catties, banana apples are 100 yuan, colored apples are 120 yuan, and Yantai big fresh fruits are 70 yuan, all falling back from the previous agreement. Only Florida tangerines are famous and expensive, with more than 100 pieces packed in each box, and the price is 140 yuan, requiring more than one yuan per piece. It is also heard that Hangzhou persimmons have already been launched on the market. Copper basin persimmons are 100 yuan, and ordinary shipments are 80 yuan to early prices on the market, and easing has already been seen. (Zhang)

### Factory Will Have Goods to Distribute Soon, Cigarette Hoarders Emerge, So Their Selling Price is Stable

The cigarette market has been slightly weak recently because the factory has passed down the news that there will be goods to distribute soon, which has softened people's minds, and sales have not been prosperous. Most of the hoarding merchants inside and outside the industry have stopped buying and started selling, so the market presents a mediocre situation. It is estimated that the Great Britain brand is 2,170 yuan, the Old Knife brand is 2,160 yuan, the Little Fairy brand is 1,645 yuan, the Pin Hai brand is 1,620 yuan, the Five Flowers brand is 1,330 yuan, the Large Beauty medium box is 1,280 yuan, the Golden Mouse brand medium box is 800 yuan, the Little Beauty medium box is 1,600 yuan, ten Great Front Gate is 550 yuan per 10,000, fifty Great Front Gate is 570 yuan, fifty Great Three Cannons is 1,220 yuan, ten Great Three Cannons is 910 yuan, fifty Small Three Cannons is 850 yuan, ten Small Three Cannons is 700 yuan, ten Great South Water is 1,500 yuan, and twenty Great South Water is 1,400 yuan.

### Shanghai-Germany Trade at a Standstill; Dalian Transshipments Greatly Reduced; Pre-Soviet-German War Orders Still Being Shipped to Shanghai

Economic expert Mr. Allers published an article yesterday entitled "The Soviet-German War and Shanghai Trade." Here is a translation: "Since news of the Soviet-German war reached Shanghai, the general opinion has naturally been that Far East trade with Germany has come to an end. As a result, another large portion of trade in this port has been forced to grind to a halt. However, the extent of the damage suffered by Shanghai trade cannot be immediately known, as there have never been clear statistics on the quantity and value of goods shipped to Germany via Dalian and Siberia. Now that the Customs has published its foreign trade report for July, we may as well try to examine this issue.

Shanghai Goods Shipped to Germany Via Dalian

As the European war entered its second year, trade through Siberia by totalitarian nations gradually expanded. As a result, the amount of goods imported to Dalian from Shanghai greatly increased. At the same time, Dalian became a transshipment port for trade between Germany and the Far East. However, the quantity of goods imported from Shanghai to the Japanese-controlled Kwantung Leased Territory and the Northeast also increased accordingly. Therefore, it is naturally intricate and difficult to determine how much of the increased exports from Shanghai to Dalian were imported into Germany and how much remained in the Japanese-controlled areas. This confusing situation made it easy for the Japanese to believe that a large quantity of goods was being transported to Germany via Dalian.

After the Soviet-German War, Flowing Elsewhere

Comparing Shanghai's exports to Dalian in June and July may provide a new explanation for this issue. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war at the end of June, goods shipped from Shanghai to Dalian for import into Germany via Siberia have ceased. However, on the other hand, goods destined for the Kwantung Leased Territory and the Northeast are still being shipped as usual. Therefore, it seems reasonable to say that the large decrease in Shanghai's imports to Dalian in July compared to the previous month of June is due to the flow of exports to Germany going elsewhere. In fact, the export trade of these reduced items seems sufficient to indicate the approximate value of goods imported into Germany from Shanghai via Dalian up to June.

Significant Drop in Recent Months

Shanghai's exports to Dalian in July dropped significantly compared to June. According to official estimates, the value of these exports in June was no less than 35,400,000 yuan, nearly 20 percent of Shanghai's total exports. However, the value of exports in July is estimated to be only 16,102,503 yuan, less than 9 percent of the port's total exports. This means that the value of these exports in July decreased by 19,300,000 yuan compared to the previous month, accounting for a full two-thirds of the total decrease in Shanghai's exports in July.

Flour and Oil Actually Increased

Furthermore, the amount of flour imported from Shanghai to Dalian in July was 3,000,000 yuan, and vegetable oil was 2,500,000 yuan. These two figures not only did not decrease compared to June but also slightly increased, which is quite intriguing. As far as these two commodities are concerned, Dalian was clearly not being used as a transshipment port for Germany. It was only because of crop failures in various parts of the Northeast last year that flour and cooking oil had to be imported to meet their needs. However, the value of other goods imported from Shanghai to Dalian in July generally decreased sharply compared to the previous month.

German Dyes Swarming to Shanghai

On the other hand, German imports to Shanghai did not decrease in July, but rather increased sharply. This is because when the Soviet-German war broke out, large quantities of German goods being transshipped via Siberia had already crossed the Soviet border twice and continued to be transported to Shanghai from Japanese-controlled areas. Therefore, German dye imports to Shanghai in July increased sharply from 716,000 yuan in June to 1,142,000 yuan, accounting for 70 percent of the port's total dye imports. At the same time, German chemicals and pharmaceuticals imported to the port increased from 162,000 yuan to 429,000 yuan. However, the future situation of this increase in German goods cannot yet be predicted.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Rice Arrives Yesterday: More Than 20,000 Bags

### Tenth Anniversary of the Northeast Incident: Silent Remembrance by All Sectors

People from all sectors of industry, commerce, and education in the city, with the tenth anniversary of the Northeast Incident fast approaching, are initiating savings in addition to silent remembrance to fulfill their responsibilities. A notice was issued yesterday to participate unanimously. For the sake of security within the concessions, the police authorities of the two concessions are currently discussing precautionary measures, which will begin one week before the anniversary and prohibit all gatherings, parades, demonstrations, and associations. As for emergency precautions such as road closures, they will be determined based on the situation.

### Only a Few Indian Nationals Leaving Shanghai on Special Ships

It is learned that there are more than 160 Indian nationals scheduled to leave Shanghai on the Taisheng Wheel on the 11th. According to the Dachung News Agency, the total number of Indian nationals in Shanghai is more than 4,000, with 700 working for the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession. The largest enterprise in Shanghai is Ralli Bros Ltd, which operates in cotton, with a total capital of 60 million yuan.

### Moller Goes to Singapore as Deputy Fire Chief

The Times reports that it was learned yesterday (the 6th) from the Fire Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council that Mr. Moller, Director of the Central Fire Brigade, has been appointed Deputy Fire Chief of the Naval Base Fire Department in Singapore. He left for Singapore with his family yesterday and will then go to Australia for a vacation. Moller worked in the Public Concession Fire Brigade for 17 years, the last six as Director of the Central Fire Brigade. Since 1939, he has served as a trainer for the Merchant Corps Reserve. Before his departure, Chinese and foreign colleagues in the Fire Department hosted a farewell banquet for him.

### 9,000 Japanese Nationals Go to Occupied Areas

### Zhang Jiluan Dies of Illness in Chongqing; Shanghai Press Cables Condolences; Dedicated His Life to Journalism, Admired by Chinese and Foreign Opinion Circles

Mr. Zhang Jiluan, editor-in-chief of Ta Kung Pao, was fair in his views and admired by the world. Unfortunately, he passed away from illness the day before yesterday. Colleagues in the Shanghai press were shocked to hear the news and mourned in unison. Yesterday, a telegram of condolence was sent to his family, which read: "To the family of Mr. Zhang Jiluan, Ta Kung Pao, Chongqing. Mr. Jiluan dedicated his life to journalism. His broad knowledge and candid speech made him a model in the field. Since the outbreak of the war, he has promoted the argument for certain victory, deeply admired by Chinese and foreign figures. His constant concern for our colleagues remaining in Shanghai is even more inspiring. We are grieved to hear of his sudden death. The press has lost a giant, and our colleagues have lost a mentor. Our grief is extreme. We respectfully offer our condolences and pray for restraint. The colleagues of the Shanghai Press."

### Linked Responsibility System for Approved Foreign Exchange If Recalled; Handling Bank Responsible to the Exchange Stabilization Fund; Importer Responsible to the Handling Bank

Regarding the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Control Measures, all Allied banks have received orders from the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee to implement them uniformly from September 6th. For foreign exchange for essential goods imports, the Exchange Stabilization Fund's rate of 9.34375 yuan for US dollars or 3 pence 1875 for British pounds, less a commission of 0.03125, will be provided. However, the application procedures are extremely strict, and the handling bank must bear full responsibility to the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Therefore, the implementation steps are quite thorough. According to a Xinhua News Agency reporter's inquiry to related banks, each designated bank has already notified its customers of the settlement method and other details, so that everyone knows and can proceed smoothly.

Allied Banks' Announcement Contents

Allied banks are issuing a special announcement to relevant clients regarding the settlement of foreign exchange for essential goods. It states: "Attached are five copies of the foreign exchange application form. Those who need to apply for Chinese legal currency foreign exchange must fill in items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 in the form and fill out five copies according to the format. The last copy must be formally signed and sealed by the importer applying for foreign exchange. Application procedures can be conducted by telegraph or letter. Although the Exchange Stabilization Fund may approve upon receipt of the application telegram, it must still be based on the application form. If it is deemed that the application form has obvious discrepancies and the telegram application has already been approved, the original handling bank may be ordered to return the settled exchange. Under these circumstances, the original applicant importer must be responsible to the original handling bank and must repay the settled foreign exchange or replenish it from the black market. The importer shall bear the loss of the difference between the black market exchange rate and the Exchange Stabilization Fund exchange rate."

Importers Must Also Provide Guarantees

The above announcement to customers indicates that in order to avoid unknown losses, banks may require importers to provide appropriate guarantees when requesting the bank to apply for foreign exchange from the Exchange Stabilization Fund, just like the guarantees provided by the handling bank to the Exchange Stabilization Fund. According to the written guarantee provided by the bank to the Exchange Stabilization Fund, see item 10 in the application form: "Our bank hereby proves, to the best of our knowledge and belief, that all the items filled in above are completely accurate. The imported goods described here are in accordance with the conditions agreed upon in our bank's application form No. XXX on Month XXX, Day XXX. If the Exchange Stabilization Fund finds that the imported goods described here are not in accordance with those described in the application form, our bank is willing to sell back to the Exchange Stabilization Fund the foreign exchange obtained from the Exchange Stabilization Fund for the supply of entry products at the exchange rate at the time of purchase. In order to guarantee the accuracy of what is stated here, our bank is willing to provide the Exchange Stabilization Fund with such written evidence as the Fund deems necessary." The guarantee that the importer should provide to the bank is also of this nature, the only difference being that one is the bank's guarantee to the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the other is the importer's guarantee to the bank.

Plenary Meeting Held in Hong Kong

The current settlement method for essential goods implemented by various banks is the result of the preliminary meeting of the Hong Kong Exchange Stabilization Committee. The second plenary meeting of the Exchange Stabilization Fund will be held at the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong in the coming days. American committee member Mr. Fox has already returned to Hong Kong from the Philippines yesterday. It is estimated that at least nine people will participate in this meeting, including Chen Guangfu, Xi Demao, Bei Songsun, Fox, Taylor, Holbartu, and other chairmen and committee members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. In addition, Mr. Hawkins, manager of the Shanghai bank McGillicuddy, and Mr. Mackay, manager of Citibank, will also be present as representatives of the Shanghai bank. Others include Mr. Adler, the representative managing the frozen funds in the Philippines. It is believed that the agenda of the formal meeting of the Exchange Stabilization Fund will not be limited to the Shanghai exchange market issue. Other matters related to the freezing of funds, the basis of legal currency, and commodity prices will also be discussed. The overall results will be seen this week.

### Eurasia Aviation Corporation Opens Hong Kong-Shaoguan Line; One-Way Fare is HK$270

In order to facilitate transportation, Eurasia Aviation Corporation has opened a new route from Hong Kong to Shaoguan (i.e., Qujiang). The trial flight was successful on the 30th of last month. Mr. Li Jingcong, the manager of the company, personally inspected the flight and was satisfied. It will be officially launched after Nanxiong informs that the construction is completed. The line is decided to be called Hong Kong-Shaoguan Line, flying from Hong Kong directly to Nanxiong. From Nanxiong onwards to Shaoguan by land, the company will not be responsible. In terms of cost, the passenger fare is HK$270 per person one way, and the cargo transportation fee is HK$3.7 per kilogram. According to the New Voice News Agency, the company was initially a Sino-German joint venture, and some of the aircraft were piloted by German pilots. However, in the past three years, they have been replaced by Chinese pilots. To date, there are no foreign flight personnel in the entire company, which can be said to be a completely state-run airline.

### Unusable Rickshaws Confiscated and Suspended; Rickshaw Owners Request a 50% Rent Increase

In order to rectify the cleanliness and safety of public rickshaws within the concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council implemented a strict inspection operation in August. Vehicles that were old, dilapidated, or unusable were confiscated. A total of 200 vehicles were confiscated last month. It is now stipulated that the license must be obtained by the 6th of each month at the latest, otherwise the license will be refused. As for the rickshaw rental fee, the Shanghai Municipal Council approved the price increase on July 10 after a long-term request from rickshaw owners. However, in recent times, the prices of hardware, rubber, and other materials have continued to soar, and the original rental fee is insufficient to maintain the business. Therefore, the industry association has requested its members to complete the price investigation of materials and submit it to the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting to increase the rental fee by 50% in accordance with the precedents of other public vehicles in order to maintain their livelihood.

### Commander of British Forces in Singapore Meets with Aiqiao for a Long Talk

### Explosion on Wanyu Wheel Kills Many; Total of Nine Dead and Injured

A tragedy occurred on Suzhou Creek yesterday morning. A small steamboat named Wanyu, located on the south bank of Suzhou Creek under the Tianhou Temple Bridge, had just been towed from the South Pier of the South City with four barges full of firewood and straw. When it was towed to the location at 8:20 yesterday morning, before it could moor, the boiler in the cabin suddenly exploded due to excessive heat. With a loud noise, the entire wheel was shattered. Three stokers in the cabin were killed on the spot, and three captains on the deck were also injured in the explosion. During the explosion, the wheel's chimney flew over to the roof of house number 398, Lane 400, Beijing Road, penetrated the roof, and fell into a room on the second floor, injuring a 12-year-old girl named Dai Jinmei and a 9-year-old boy named Dai Azong, and killing a two-sentence male of one year. Afterwards, they were sent to Renji Hospital and the coroner's office for treatment and inspection. It was also learned that the windows in the surrounding area were shattered by the explosion, which shows the magnitude of the blast. The ship's hull was damaged and soon sank into the water. After the Water Patrol Police received the news, they urgently dispatched a small wheel to the scene and temporarily cut off traffic near the accident site. It was not restored until after 9:00. The four barges towed by the wheel were intact and not affected.

It is reported that 340 Japanese nationals arrived in Shanghai on the French Post Bainating Saint Debia Wheel. The ship was scheduled to arrive at 9:30 this morning.

### General Manager of Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory Wu Zhesheng Was Kidnapped Yesterday; 11 Kidnappers in Two Cars; One Car Found

At 7:11 yesterday morning, a kidnapping occurred in Hua'anfang, Lane 1088, Xujiahui Road, French Concession. The kidnapped person was Wu Zhesheng, general manager of Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory. A total of 11 kidnappers went in two black-plated cars. The situation that has been detected is recorded as follows:

Strict Gate Control

Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory is a giant of rubber factories in the city. The factory's general headquarters is located at No. 24, Lane 63, Dongqipan Street to No. 24, Lane 13. There is also a distribution office at No. 6, Lane 15, Jiangxi Road. Its first factory is located at No. 1102, Xujiahui Road, manufacturing various tires and galoshes. The scale is very large, employing more than 1,200 workers, and the business is quite developed. The general manager is Wu Zhesheng from Nanjing. He lives at No. 11 and No. 12, Hua'anfang, Lane 1088, next to the first factory. The gate control of the lane is strict, with two Sikh constables rotating day and night to guard it. Wu has a Shanghai Municipal Council car license No. 7963.

Forced the Gatekeeper

At about 7:00 yesterday morning, 11 bandits, 6 of whom were holding pistols, arrived at the entrance of Hua'anfang in two Shanghai Municipal Council black-plated car license Nos. 2235 and 3724. They jumped down and 5 of them guarded the entrance to keep watch, while the remaining 6 forced the day-shift gatekeeper with weapons, not allowing him to speak out, and took the bullets from the cylinder of his public duty pistol. They then forced him to lead them to No. 11 of the lane. They first knocked on Wu's back door, pretending to have something to look for Mr. Wu. The maid of Wu's house opened the door to greet them.

Forcibly Taken Away

At this time, the bandits forced the maid to lead 3 of the bandits to Wu's bedroom on the second floor. The remaining 3 bandits guarded the front and back doors separately. At that time, Wu and his wife, Mrs. Yang, were still in bed. Wu woke up startled when he heard the noise and was about to leave the room to investigate when he ran into the bandits. One of the bandits fired a shot to demonstrate his power. The bullet hit the floorboard under the bed. Without asking any questions, Wu was forcibly dragged away. Wu asked the bandits to allow him to change his clothes because he was wearing pajamas, but the bandits refused. They immediately dragged Wu downstairs and, together with the bandits guarding the front and back doors, left together. Wu was then kidnapped into the bandit vehicle and drove west quickly.

Bandit Vehicle Found

At about 10:00 yesterday morning, one of the bandit vehicles, No. 2235, was found at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Daxilu. However, there was no one in the car. Both cars were stolen by the bandits. Since Wu Zhesheng was kidnapped, there has been no news as of last night. The French Concession Police are currently trying to rescue him.

### Suspects in the Post Office Embezzlement Case May Be Released

Three old clerks from the Shanghai Post Office embezzlement case and two bodyguards, who are suspects in the embezzlement case, have not been released since they were detained by the Japanese Military Police in Hongkou. According to the Post Office, apart from the two who are most suspected, the remaining three are expected to be released soon.

### Lunar Eclipse Early the Other Day

It is learned that a lunar eclipse was seen in Shanghai at about 1:00 AM on the 6th. However, it was in the middle of the night, and very few people saw it.

### Passerby Collapses and Dies Suddenly

Wang Sizhi, a native of Zhenjiang, 44 years old, residing at No. 39, Fangxie Road, Nanshi, collapsed suddenly in front of the Franco-Chinese School in the French Concession at 8:00 the night before. The police sent him to Guangci Hospital for diagnosis. He was diagnosed with acute meningitis and transferred to the isolation hospital for treatment, but he died at 10:00 yesterday morning. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall, awaiting relatives to claim it. He will be buried immediately to avoid infection.

### Letter

To the Editor, This is to inform you that according to Xie Hao, the manager of Zhenyuan Fine Dyeing Company, he recently read a news item in the local section of your newspaper on the 5th about a bomb being found in Zhenyuan Dyeing and Weaving Factory, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. No. 11, Lane 172, Arlabaster Road, is only the location of our company, and there is no Zhenyuan Dyeing and Weaving Factory. Moreover, our company has always treated its workers very generously, so labor and management have always been harmonious, and there have been no complaints so far. The report in your newspaper is presumably a rumor that is inaccurate. As this concerns our company's brand name, we are sincerely afraid of affecting our business reputation and confusing workers' hearing, so it is difficult to remain silent. Please issue a letter to clarify and correct the record. Lawyer Chen Kunyuan.

### Soviet Ships Stranded in Various Ports Preparing to Sail to Vladivostok; Divided into Hong Kong and Dutch East Indies Lines; Soviet Ships Stranded in Hong Kong Are Waiting for Orders to Export

According to shipping industry sources, in order to strengthen the shipping and transportation capabilities of the Far East, the Soviet government intends to adjust the routes of the ships stranded in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Manila, dividing them into two lines: Hong Kong to Vladivostok, and the Dutch East Indies and Australian Sydney to Vladivostok. It is now heard that the Soviet shipping agencies in various locations have issued orders to all ships to prepare as soon as possible to strengthen the Vladivostok transportation line. According to reports, the Soviet ships currently undergoing repairs in Shanghai shipyards include Soviet (2,76x tons), Food Industry (10,078 tons), and Ke Fuda (2,763 tons). There are also three ships, including Molotov, undergoing repairs at the Taikoo Shipyard in Hong Kong, and three ships, including Volkohuo, in the Philippines. The Soviet ships stranded in Hong Kong are all preparing to wait for export orders but will not come to Shanghai Bay to avoid delaying the mission.

### Guilin Municipal Government Solves School Shortage, Six Provisional Measures for Unified Entrance Examination

(Guilin Correspondence) The population of Guilin City has increased sharply in recent years, and the number of students in primary and secondary schools has also increased accordingly. The original schools are insufficient to accommodate them, especially primary schools. As the autumn semester begins this year, this phenomenon of school shortage has occurred again. Yesterday, the reporter specifically interviewed Qin Changqi, the chief of the Education Section of the Municipal Government, to inquire about solutions. According to him, Guilin City had a population of only about 50,000 people 27 years ago, and the existing schools were sufficient at that time. Since the outbreak of the war and the relocation of the provincial capital to Guilin, the population has gradually increased, and the schools have gradually become insufficient. The provincial government allocated 100,000 yuan, and the local government raised another 100,000 yuan, with the standard that Guilin City's population reached 100,000. Six Zhen Central Schools were built, including Bagui, Bailong, Yinan, and Dongjiang schools. Each school must open at least 24 classes, and it is planned to continue building Fengbei, Peifeng and other Zhen Central Schools. At this time, Guilin City was continuously bombed by Japanese aircraft, causing the completed central schools and major affiliated rural primary schools to be occupied by government agencies, preventing schools from opening. The population of Guilin City has now reached 280,000. Due to these reasons, the schools are not enough to accommodate students, which is an inevitable fact. According to statistics in May this year, about 10,000 primary school students in the city were unable to attend school and were stranded at home. Education is the foundation of the country, and the occurrence of this phenomenon has a significant impact on the future of the country. Therefore, the municipal government has actively sought solutions to this problem during the summer vacation this year. The following temporary measures have been decided: 1. To accurately count the number of school-age children in the city, a unified entrance examination for primary school students will be held on the 25th in each school. 2. Senior primary school students should pay attention to their physical and mental health and strictly assess their academic performance. Qualified students should be evenly distributed to various schools to avoid uneven distribution. 3. Senior primary schools should stipulate that each class should accommodate at least 50 students. 4. Primary schools should give priority to accommodating school-age children as much as possible without exceeding the quota. 5. If the number of students in each junior primary school is too large, a two-part teaching system should be implemented. 6. Increase the salaries of primary school teachers, stipulating from 75 yuan to 150 or 60 yuan. Schools that implement the two-part teaching system should also hire more teachers to teach classes.

### Subsidy for Poor Students from Middle Schools Distributed to Schools the Day Before Yesterday

The economic subsidy for poor students jointly organized by the Chinese Christian Young Men's and Women's Associations in this port has been reviewed and approved, and it has been decided to subsidize 150 people. The subsidy has been distributed to 38 schools the day before yesterday. Students who receive the subsidy can collect it from their respective schools with a formal receipt. The association will not issue separate individual notices.

### Revised and Published Maps of Native and Foreign Geography

The "Textbook Maps of Native Geography for Middle Schools" and "Textbook Maps of Foreign Geography for Middle Schools" published by the Chinese Society for Geography have been praised by geographers in various places and promoted for adoption since their release. The native map has been printed to the seventh edition, and the foreign map has also been printed to the fifth edition. With each reprint, changes in geography and the needs of teaching are taken into account as much as possible to adapt to the times. The seventh edition of the native map has many revisions and additions. In addition to the complete county names of the country, military and transportation hubs have also been greatly increased. For example, Zhanggufeng and Nuomenhan, which have been disputed by Japan and the Soviet Union in recent years, Yunnan Wanmading and Guangdong Shayuyong, which are new transportation hubs, Tianshui on the Longhai Railway, which has recently opened to traffic, Desheng on the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, Sanyuan and Shuiji in Fujian Province, which have been newly added, Wangmo County in Guizhou Province, and Qilian and Haitong, the three new administrative bureaus in Qinghai Province, have all been added. The materials used can be said to be the latest. Cloth cover and exquisite binding, each volume is 3.1 yuan, and many middle schools use them. The company is located at No. 38 Xinmin Village, Haimalang Road.

### The Start of Work

— Editor

The "Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation Weekly" has been around for three years since it first met its readers. It has made some small contributions to the four essential elements of life. However, now we must bid farewell to our readers. This is not to say that we are so severely threatened by clothing, food, housing, and transportation that we can henceforth live without clothing, food, housing, or transportation, becoming earthly immortals. It is because in this great era, life has countless threads, and one cannot simply focus on personal clothing, food, housing, and transportation to solve everything. Expanding from the individual, there is the family. The scope of the family is larger, and the issues that can be discussed and studied are more numerous and complex. Therefore, starting today, the "Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation Weekly" will be changed to the "Family Weekly." Recalling the ancient saying that "when the family is in order, the state will be governed," the birth of this "Family Weekly" seems not to be without significance.

Generally, people have different views on the family. Some think the family is a burden, others think marriage is a foolish act, and still others think there is nothing to discuss within the family. As a result, many people do not study the organization and management of the family, let alone improve it. However, not to mention the existing family structure, the number of young men and women marrying is increasing day by day. They do not know what married life is, what family economics are. Relying on their limited knowledge, they handle things arbitrarily. Isn't it difficult to achieve satisfactory results?

We don't need to discuss whether the family is ultimately necessary for social organization. Since everyone has a family, if we can improve it through discussion, positively speaking, we can make the family organization more sound and social order more orderly. Negatively speaking, family expenses can be greatly reduced through planned consumption, and family life can avoid unnecessary disputes because of the conditions of mutual love, loyalty, and honesty between husband and wife. Therefore, family issues are worth discussing, and family management methods are worth studying.

However, this is not an easy task that yields quick results. It requires considerable time and continuous effort. In the future, the articles published in this journal will focus on practicality, supplemented by interest, with the overarching premise of enabling ordinary families to live a rational life. We firmly believe that with the efforts of our readers, their constant contributions of ideas, and cooperative conditions, we can certainly achieve considerable success.

### New Pillow Flower Design

— Jing

The flowers embroidered on pillowcases are indeed very elaborate. If they are too vulgar, they can affect the owner's status. Embroidering a few foreign words seems a bit unnatural. Here is a border pattern that seems reproducible, with all kinds of flowers. You only need to enlarge it. If you particularly like a certain flower, you may want to draw it larger and use the other flowers as a foil. Why not try it right away?

### Housewife's Notes

Putting lemon juice in the water for cooking rice can make the rice color clean and lovely (this is naturally a formal method).

· Do not place rubber utensils in the drawer where silverware is stored, as it can cause the silverware to turn black.

· If paint accidentally stains glass, it can be wiped off by boiling it with vinegar.

· Adding a little crystal monosodium glutamate to coffee or milk makes the taste richer and more fragrant.

· When wiping a mirror, dipping the cloth in some cold tea can achieve good results.

· When opening a tight screw-on bottle cap, using a piece of sandpaper can make it easy.

· If children stick chewing gum on tables or other furniture, you can first soften it with egg white and then wash it off without leaving any traces.

### A Major Problem in Chinese Families—Child Rearing

— Chen Kemei

When it comes to the improvement of Chinese families, there are too many problems. This is a natural phenomenon during any social change, especially in a country with a long history and a family system that has remained unchanged for thousands of years. Encountering an unprecedented global transformation—the eastward spread of Western culture—is simply overwhelming, and everything becomes a problem. Therefore, discussing Chinese family problems is truly a complex and daunting task. Here, I would like to mention one of the biggest and most important problems first and ask everyone to pay attention to it. This problem is the raising of children.

The importance of child rearing seems self-evident in China because China has always emphasized the concept of descendants, valuing children, and emphasizing "incense." The saying goes, "There are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest." However, strangely enough, Chinese people only want to have children, not healthy and lively children. They only want many children, not good children. They only emphasize quantity and not quality. This kind of attitude is like that of lower organisms, which reproduce in large numbers to ensure that some survive, which is also a preparation for many deaths. Therefore, "the louse becomes a grandmother in three days." However, the most wasteful thing in the universe is nothing more than this. The reason why lower organisms remain lower organisms forever lies in this completely blind waste. However, the lives of lower organisms are much simpler, and reproduction and rearing are much easier. They can afford this kind of waste. But human life is so complex, childbirth is so difficult, and rearing is so costly and laborious that we cannot afford this kind of waste. Therefore, the Chinese attitude of emphasizing quantity over quality is completely wrong and should be improved immediately. Otherwise, not only will our children's lives be like the cicadas that live only until dusk, but their lives will also be like the stupid and filthy deer and pigs. From an individual point of view, what value does life have? What fun is there in life? From the perspective of the nation, what competitive ability do people with short lifespans and dull minds have? What possibility is there for survival? Even if they勉强survive, they will only be used by others as beasts of burden.

Therefore, the importance of child rearing, on a small scale, is related to individual happiness. On a large scale, it is related to the survival of the nation. From the perspective of the family, child rearing must be carried out in the family. Therefore, the family bears the dual responsibility of individual happiness and national survival. Therefore, no family problem is as important as child rearing.

### Curtain Design

— Wan Qiuhong

At the beginning of autumn, ordinary families should think about the issue of window decoration, because in the coming months, the windows will be closed more often. Therefore, they have to think about how to put some decorations on the glass.

There are many ways to make curtains. The style on the upper left of the picture is very common and suitable for long windows. Even shorter windows can use this style, as long as the shape of the window is rectangular.

The second and third methods are relatively novel. The one on the left can make narrow and long windows appear wider, and the one below can make low and short windows appear wider. As for the materials used, you can use cloth, silk, or yarn according to your own preferences. In terms of color, it is best to be harmonious with the color of the walls or furniture.

### (129) Fried Money Cakes

— Lu Yu (Draft)

Ingredients... Bean curd dregs cakes, pork, soy oil, cooking wine, fine salt, soy sauce, monosodium glutamate, refined white water chestnut flour

Preparation... First chop the pork into fine pieces, add a little cooking wine, salt, soy sauce, monosodium glutamate, etc., and mix well with chopsticks. Use a knife to slice open the bean curd dregs cakes, but only slice them halfway through, not all the way. Mix the water chestnut flour with cold water to form a paste. Then gently embed the minced meat into the bean curd dregs cakes. At any time, use water chestnut flour to seal the slits that were cut. At the same time, heat an appropriate amount of soy oil until boiling. Then put the bean curd dregs cakes in and fry until both sides are yellow. This cake is loose and crispy and is a good dish for drinking and eating with rice. Bean curd dregs cakes are sold in small vegetable markets. They are made from bean curd dregs, about the size of a large copper coin, about two or three cents thick. It would be even better if they were the size of a silver coin.

### (130) Lotus Flower Soup

— Zhou Shufen (Draft)

Ingredients... Dried mushrooms, fresh meat, salt, soy sauce, wine, monosodium glutamate

Preparation... First wash the dried mushrooms to remove the roots, soak them in warm water until they become plump, then chop the fresh meat into pieces, mix with an appropriate amount of salt, wine, soy sauce, monosodium glutamate, etc., make meat balls the same size as the dried mushrooms, place them on the reverse side of the dried mushrooms, steam them over water, then put them into the soup in which the dried mushrooms were soaked to cook thoroughly. If there is not much soup, you can add water and salt as needed. The saltiness of the soup must be accurate, otherwise the freshness will be lost.

Gentlemen... If you want to buy "monosodium glutamate," "Tianfu Soy Sauce Essence," as well as oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar, please call "44594," and a special delivery person will be sent immediately, without charging a delivery fee.

### A Week's Home-Style Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

I remember that in Mr. Qian Yunhe's solo exhibition last year, there was a painting of hyacinth beans, painted very meticulously. Mr. Shou Juan wrote a poem on it, with the line "Autumn scenery is no less beautiful than spring, enchanting the hyacinth bean flowers by the fence," which left a deep impression on me. I often recite it idly, because I love to eat hyacinth beans very much. Although hyacinth beans have been on the market for more than a month, they are still very tender and can be eaten. For a meat dish, you can stir-fry it with sliced meat and edamame, which is rich and delicious. If you want to eat vegetarian, then just add some dried tofu strips. If you add some sweet sauce, that would be even better.

Monday

Stir-fried Hyacinth Beans with Sliced Meat, Clear Crucian Carp Soup, Baiye Cabbage, Pickled Mustard Greens with Mung Bean Sprouts

Tuesday

Onion Beef Strips, Vinegar-Glazed Yellow Croaker Slices, Vegetarian Fried Tofu Soup, Braised Winter Melon

Wednesday

Cabbage and Minced Meat Balls, Scallop Egg Flower Soup, Scallion Broad Bean Paste, Raw Lettuce

Thursday

Tomato Beef Soup, Sweet and Sour Fried Beltfish, Baiye Jiao Bai Strips, Fried Dough Sticks with Soybean Sprouts

Spring and Autumn

### Mourning Mr. Zhang Jiluan

— Yugong

Mr. Zhang Jiluan devoted his life to the newspaper industry, serving the country with his articles, upholding the truth, and being a model of integrity. His sincerity and passion were worthy of emulation by young people.

Now, Mr. Zhang has unfortunately passed away, a giant star has fallen in the newspaper industry, and scholars have lost a teacher. I still remember that five years ago, on Mr. Zhang's fiftieth birthday, Mr. Yu Youren gave him a poem that included "Doing things for others every day, thinking of the country's difficulties at all times, entrusting his heroic feelings to Kunqu opera, defending the Divine Land with his pen."

Mr. Zhang's words and deeds are recorded in history. What we mourn about Mr. Zhang today is only the phrase "with a calm mind and passionate feelings." Only those who have accumulated virtue and can write articles like Mr. Zhang can achieve this. Although Mr. Zhang has passed away, his passion is radiant and will be remembered forever.

### A Warning to Students Selected for Scholarship Assistance

— An Anonymous Old Man

An anonymous old man, alias "A Pitiful Man of the World." This newspaper launched a scholarship assistance campaign, and the old man warmly supported it by providing 2,000 yuan to subsidize the tuition fees of 50 students of all levels in primary and secondary schools. His noble heart is a model for all. This man also admitted that he is nearly sixty years old, and his days are numbered. He runs a small business with limited capacity and is willing to do his best to provide a little help. If he is still alive next semester and his business does not change suddenly, he will continue to provide assistance. (See this newspaper on August 10 for the original letter.) Now we have obtained the old man's handwriting, which is more precious than treasure, and we are publishing it urgently, hoping to encourage all hardworking students in society. (Editor's note)

I admire the enthusiasm of the gentlemen who initiated the reader scholarship assistance fund in the Shenbao and deeply feel the pain of young people who cannot afford to go to school. Therefore, I have done my best to contribute my meager savings. I am extremely ashamed that the editor of the Shenbao praised me too much in the editorial on the 21st of last month! I will tell the selected students about my own experiences as a lesson from the past.

I lost my parents when I was young, and my family was destitute. Although my brother was a scholar, his income from teaching was very meager. Therefore, at the age of seventeen, I was forced to drop out of school. Driven by hunger and cold, I had no choice but to leave home to find work. Suppressing my eagerness to learn, I tearfully walked a hundred miles to a mountain village and became an apprentice in a grocery store. The store owner was not wealthy, and adding an apprentice was already too much of a burden.

Therefore, I was responsible for carrying firewood, fetching water, washing clothes, and cooking. Moreover, each meal was limited to two bowls. Adding more would incur the store owner's contemptuous looks. I swallowed the food of humiliation with tears, which led to stomach problems that became more severe in my prime. The store owner was extremely frugal and did not light lamps in the evening. Moreover, there was nothing to read in the countryside. I occasionally borrowed two letters of the Qiu Shui Xuan Xue Hong Xuan from the owner of the neighboring oil store and pondered them every night by moonlight. I also practiced abacus calculations, ignoring the mosquitoes gathering on my back in the hot summer. I never stopped learning. The neighbor told the store owner that I was so diligent in my studies that I would surely make a name for myself in the future, and he should treat me well. A year later, I finally earned a monthly salary of eight jiao, which allowed me to wear a lined jacket in winter, but I still had no mosquito net in summer. The hardship was beyond words. At the age of twenty, a friend of my brother introduced me to work as a bookkeeper in a cloth shop in Yuyao, with a monthly salary of only three yuan, which was already considered exceptional. Three years later, I carried a broken quilt and a few jiao to Shanghai to take the recruitment exam for a bookstore. I was selected as the second-best in abacus calculation and received a monthly salary of fourteen yuan. I walked to work and spent no money. At the age of twenty-five, I buried my ancestors. At the age of twenty-seven, I married. I thought that living under someone else's roof was not a long-term plan, so I set up a book stall on Fuzhou Road. It has been more than twenty years since then. I have been half-merchant and half-scholar. Although I have no time to rest, I never forget my books. This is how I have achieved what I have today. In recent years, my temples have turned gray, and I have a little surplus, but I donate most of it to relatives and friends in need and charitable organizations. Therefore, I am still as poor as before. I never record the names of the donors, because I do not want to use this money to seek fame and reputation. Now, the students are forced by circumstances and have the ambition to study but not the ability to do so. Fortunately, they have received assistance and can go to school. This is a rare opportunity. Emperor Taizong of Tang said, "When I was eighteen years old, I was still among the people and knew their hardships. Therefore, I was able to achieve the Zhenguan era, which was comparable to the rule of Cheng and Kang." During the Jin Dynasty, the people were malnourished, and Emperor Hui asked, "Why don't they eat meat porridge?" This led to the chaos of the Five Dynasties and the humiliation of the Qingyi. The sage said, "Heaven will bestow great responsibility on this person, and he must first suffer his mind, strain his muscles." The students have better opportunities than I did. I hope that you will uphold the spirit of reading diligently in cold and hot weather and become pillars of the country and mentors of society in the future. Remember the exhortations of the Shenbao editorial writer that although you are receiving assistance from society today, you will be able to repay society in the future. Then it will not only be the luck of one person, but society and the country will also benefit from it. Students, strive!

### Shanghai's Used Book Industry

— Lu Zuishi

No one can deny that books are the most important source of spiritual nourishment in life. I have always loved reading, but unfortunately, in this era of high prices and soaring book prices, I am forced to often go hungry for reading due to economic pressure. In this suffocating atmosphere of the isolated island, not being able to obtain adequate spiritual nourishment is indeed a very regrettable thing, but regret is still regret, and it cannot satisfy the desire to read. Running to the library, it is difficult to get to good things, and even if you borrow them, it is impossible to fully understand the content of a book in a short time, so I have fallen in love with old books. Although they are "ragged on the outside," their content has not diminished, and they can be called "gold and jade within." Therefore, I often visit various used bookstores in my spare time to find books I love at low prices, and I can often "get what I want." Once a book is out of print in a new bookstore, there is no way to find it, but used bookstores can often discover it. Because of the "low price and many types," many people buy them, and the business of used bookstores is booming. Book stalls and bookstores are springing up like mushrooms after rain.

The distribution of used book stalls and bookstores in Shanghai is mainly concentrated in two areas: one is the middle section of Sima Road and Henan Road, and the other is Carter Road. There are also a few in the Puzhong Road, Lafayette Road, and Albert Road areas.

Shanghai Bookstore on Sima Road sells many types of books, but there do not seem to be many high-value books. Meihua Bookstore is similar to the above. Chunqiu Bookstore has fewer rare books, but the price is still fair. Chuanxin Bookstore mainly focuses on woodblock books, so there are very few new books. There are book stalls on Henan Road across from the Fire Brigade. There is a bookstore near the Commercial Press. The book stalls have a large number of books. Because they do not know the editions of Western books, there are many old editions. The Shanghai Used Bookstore near the Commercial Press has quite a few books, but there are more Western books than Chinese books, so the buyers are highly educated, and the prices are higher. They are willing to accept books that other stores dare not accept. This is true for Western books, and it is also true for Chinese books.

Now it is the beginning of the school season, and a group of students are busy running around used bookstores. I sincerely hope that all new and old bookstores will "greatly reduce prices" to help the isolated island with spiritual nourishment. I think the bookstore owners who have cultural responsibilities will definitely be able to sacrifice generously.

### Common Sense of Industry and Commerce—Various Uses of Fluorescent Lamps

— Yidao

Fluorescence has a wide range of uses. Here are some of the main ones:

Because of its high luminous efficiency and energy saving, fluorescence has great benefits for industry and commerce. For example, in factories, starting with five lights worth of electricity, installing fluorescent lights is enough to supply thirty-five to sixty lights. This has a great impact on the speed and refinement of production. In department stores, hotels, and offices, installing fluorescent lamps can save more than 30% of electricity. In museums, there used to be no good way to display the rare and difficult-to-see aurora borealis to the public, but now fluorescence can be used to simulate the aurora borealis. As for fluorescent lamps suitable for residential use, although there are some shortcomings, engineers are now working on improving them. It is expected that a six-inch-long, half-inch-thick fluorescent lamp suitable for home use will soon appear.

In medicine, fluorescence can help doctors diagnose diseases, because under the scrutiny of a fluorescent microscope, each different microbe has a different special color. For example, tuberculosis bacteria are yellow, typhoid A bacteria are purple-yellow, typhoid B bacteria are green-yellow, cancer bacteria are cyan-violet, and the cells of healthy people are pure black.

Fluorescence can also solve criminal cases, especially cases of forged signatures. Because under ultraviolet light, different inks can emit different colors of fluorescence, so altering checks, documents, or stealing mail can all be detected using the principles of fluorescence. There is also a fluorescent powder that can be applied to banknotes or commodities. If they are stolen, the thief's hands will be stained with this powder, and his hands will reflect green light under the light. Also, butter and margarine are the same color in sunlight, but under ultraviolet light, margarine will emit blue fluorescence. Fresh eggs emit red fluorescence, but eggs stored for more than ten days emit red-ochre fluorescence, or even blue fluorescence. Using fluorescence, it is also possible to identify beets mixed in coffee or impure, poor-quality oils. Therefore, fluorescence is no different from a loud warning to unscrupulous merchants and their deceptive practices.

In military affairs, the use of fluorescence cannot be ignored. For example, the lights in the latest fighter jets are all fluorescent, which on the one hand can achieve the effect of not irritating the pilot's eyes, and on the other hand, there is no worry of being seen by the enemy. The entrances and exits of British underground air-raid shelters are coated with fluorescent powder to avoid the attention of enemy aircraft. Military terrain coated with this powder can be clearly displayed even in extremely dark places. There is also a beautiful method of using fluorescence to find tungsten ore seedlings, which is currently being tested.

### Begonia

— Qin Qingou

Twelve Unexpected Troubles

"But as I see it, there's an eight out of ten chance it wasn't him, right?" Old Meng deliberately added a tail, indicating that he could not assume responsibility.

Little Gouzi was already following behind Begonia, about to step out of the circle of wooden counters built against the street. Hearing Old Shopkeeper Meng say this, he became very angry. He forgot the consequences for a moment and turned back to sneer at him.

"Ten out of ten, eight out of ten, that's something even gods can't say for sure!" He pretended to be talking to Chen Da, who was in the same trade, only raising his voice very high, intentionally wanting the people behind to hear. "But they have the ability to steal people, and we have the ability to find people. Let's see what they have to say when we find them!"

Begonia was busy turning back to wink at him, but Little Gouzi's words had already been spoken and could not be taken back.

Shopkeeper Meng and his daughter-in-law heard this from behind, but did not reply. That Mrs. Meng, who didn't understand anything but loved to interfere, had nothing to say at all, while that Old Meng was deliberately unwilling to quarrel with Little Gouzi. He was just smiling coldly with a pipe in his mouth.

"With you, a countryman who has never seen the world, wanting to bring people back, you're still far from it!" He leaned his body against the counter, watching the backs of Begonia and the other two, thinking to himself.

This thought was indeed somewhat reasonable.

Although Little Gouzi had a bellyful of loyalty and wished he could risk his life to bring back Mei Bao, his ability and knowledge were ultimately too limited. The next day, although he took that Chen Da, the handyman of the county middle school, and rushed around in Zhangshu Village for a day, trying to recognize the person who had tricked Mei Bao away, how could things be so easy?
