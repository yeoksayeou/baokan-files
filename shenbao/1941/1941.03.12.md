### First Declaration of the Second National Political Council: Announcing to the National People with Recognition and Faith: China's Resistance and Nation-Building Has Achieved Spiritual Victory

Chongqing - The National Political Council concluded its tenth session. The General Assembly issued an official statement as follows: "Declaration of the First Session of the Second National Political Council." On March 1st of this year, the First Session of the First National Political Council opened in Chongqing, the accompanying capital. All of us elected members, recognizing the severity of the national crisis, felt it our duty to contribute our intelligence. Therefore, except for those with actual obstacles, we all came to the meeting from all over the country and overseas. Out of a total of 127 members, 203 attended, the highest attendance rate in the history of the General Assembly. Colleagues convened according to law for ten days, accepted the policy reports from the various ministries and commissions of the National Government, deliberated on the government's internal and external guidelines for the 30th year submitted by the Executive Yuan, and a total of more than 150 proposals from colleagues on politics, military affairs, finance and economy, diplomacy, education, culture, disaster relief, and overseas Chinese affairs. Today, as the session concludes, colleagues should comprehensively report to the national compatriots on the common understanding and beliefs of this meeting. Therefore, in addition to individually publishing various resolutions, we make the following declaration: On the day the National Political Council was ordered to convene, our country's self-defense war had lasted for three years and seven months, and the European War had extended the Pacific situation, brewing drastic changes. Therefore, colleagues believe that the mission of this General Assembly is more important than previous gatherings of the First National Political Council, and it is even more necessary to first conduct a thorough review of whether the past resistance and nation-building policies and work are appropriate and effective. Then, based on the current world situation and the current situation between China and Japan, we must determine the focus of future work, clarify the security guarantees for combat and nation-building, and the path forward, so that compatriots throughout the country can work together.

Government's Resistance and Nation-Building Policy Proves Appropriate and Effective

Regarding this point, colleagues first base their unanimous understanding and beliefs, and respectfully raise two points to inform our people. First, China's combat has indeed achieved spiritual victory. Therefore, the guidelines and policies announced in the National Government's Resistance and Nation-Building Program have proven to be appropriate and effective. China's combat is a major event in the world, but all countries in the world have ignored it. Although public opinion is prosperous, empty words are useless. Only by relying on all our soldiers, fighting bravely and hard, month after month, year after year, spitting out the righteousness of heaven and earth, blocking the turbulent waves in the Far East, until today, ten years later, the whole world suddenly recognizes that the hard-fighting China is actually the cornerstone of the Far East situation. The international community has always looked down on China, not knowing that the Chinese nation has the determination to fight to the end and the great power to never be conquered. The combat in the past three years and seven months has proven the unbreakable nature of this determination and power. All the main points of the declaration of the First Session of the First National Political Council have also proven to be correct in these two years. In the future, we should strengthen our belief in self-defense. People all over the world unanimously recognize that China will never be conquered and perish. This is the spiritual victory of China, the victory of the Three People's Principles, and a permanent blessing for our combat soldiers and civilians who shed blood for the country. There is no other way to victory. The reason is extremely just, the purpose is extremely pure, combat is for self-defense and self-rescue, nation-building is for self-reliance and self-preservation, we have no means other than abiding by our beliefs in the world, and no demands other than freedom and equality, we run through the purpose of combat with self-sacrifice, and we accept international cooperation with peace and justice. This kind of guideline, based on the spirit of history and culture, has become the common belief of the nation. Four years of bloody battle, unyielding and indomitable, has proven its obvious effect today. What we hope our people will believe in more firmly is that it will never change. (Unfinished telegram from the 10th)

After the speech, Councilor Mo Dehui rose to give a reply on behalf of all the councilors. After the meeting, Chairman Zhang Boling officially read the declaration of the General Assembly. The First Session of the Second National Political Council concluded in a solemn and solemn atmosphere with melodious music (telegram from the 10th).

### Chairman Chiang's Closing Remarks: Should Supervise the Government and the National People in the Spirit of Seeking Truth from Facts, and Implement All British Resolutions Effectively

Chongqing - The First Session of the Second National Political Council concluded on the 10th. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a closing speech, the original text of which is as follows: The First Session of the Second National Political Council has come to a successful conclusion today. All of you colleagues have established substantial and complete resolutions on various reports and proposals through ten days of hard work and effort. The government will definitely implement them accordingly. In the future, not only will the combat be greatly advanced, but also the spirit of unity of our national people from beginning to end can be fully demonstrated internally and externally. This will inevitably lead to the greatest victory and success in military and diplomatic affairs, which is what the colleagues of this meeting feel most gratified about. On the occasion of this closing session, as colleagues are about to return to various places or overseas, I would like to specifically state the key points that we should focus on in our future efforts.

Valuable Application: Past Experience

Based on my feelings, I will briefly state them. What I must tell you is that in the three and a half years before this General Assembly, our greatest task in combat was to strike violence with the strong spirit of national unity, so as to lay the foundation for national victory. After this meeting, the progress of all resistance and nation-building undertakings has become even more urgent due to the internal and external situation. Success or failure, advantages or disadvantages, are of greater importance. In addition to emphasizing the spirit, we must also pay special attention to the specific actions and the performance of all work and facts in various departments. It is necessary to apply the past experience and lessons learned in a valuable way. Everything must be based on seeking truth from facts, so as to promote progress step by step. The government and the people must be vigilant and fearful, and there must be no perfunctory or exaggerated behavior. It is even more appropriate to absolutely sacrifice the views of parties or individual interests, strengthen the contact with friendly countries such as the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States, and the consistent support of this meeting for diplomatic national policies will surely fully achieve the purpose of our resistance and nation-building. In terms of politics, the biggest shortcoming in China's past politics lies in advocating declarations without striving for practical action. Therefore, after each session, all the declared resolutions often become empty talk. The reason why politics is abandoned is because this is the fundamental reason. After the adjournment of this meeting, all colleagues should supervise the government and the national people to implement the resolutions of this meeting in a practical and effective manner in the spirit of seeking truth from facts.

During the recess of the General Assembly, all resident staff members will inevitably assist the government in a timely manner based on their powers. I also hope that all my colleagues will similarly urge the people to assist the government in various places, so that all facilities can be promoted quickly and surely. Then our politics will inevitably gain more and more progress every day.

Implement Military Orders and Rectify Discipline

In terms of military affairs, the government's efforts to replenish combat strength have been sufficient to fill the sacrifices and consumption in combat, and have more than doubled compared with before the war. The prospect of resistance and nation-building has indeed been firmly grasped. The only key in the future is to implement military orders and rectify military discipline. If military orders can be implemented and military discipline can be rectified, then the final victory will not be far off. I have said this repeatedly. What I hope for from the colleagues of this meeting is to advocate that the national people confirm the absolute importance of wartime discipline, supervise the government and assist the government to strictly rectify military discipline and implement military orders, so as to complete the mission of resistance and nation-building. In terms of economy, this is a problem of great concern to this General Assembly, and it is also related to the success or failure, survival or death in the future. If the wartime economic problems can be solved and economic construction can be completed at the same time, then the prospect of victory will be firmly guaranteed. The proposals and resolutions of this meeting on economic matters are all practical and important. I believe that the government will be able to implement them effectively, and I hope that all of you will assist them together. Not only should you study the advantages and disadvantages of the current problems of food, supplies, transportation, and transportation at any time, contribute practical materials and opinions, and seek a satisfactory solution, but also pay attention to the fundamental economic construction of the country. We should not only make the wartime economic foundation absolutely solid, but also make national defense economic construction solid. Such as developing materials, increasing production, promoting national industrialization, and hoping to advocate the joint efforts of the whole country.

Economic Construction is Most Important

What is most memorable to us is that the practical contribution of the colleagues of the First National Political Council to promoting national military and economic construction was very great. Taking the Sichuan-Kang construction period achievement meeting as an example, the achievements of the two provinces of Sichuan and Kang in banning opium and suppressing bandits today, as well as other political and economic progress, are mostly due to the fact that the colleagues of the period achievement meeting personally went to various places, regardless of hardships, to assist the government in implementing them with practical strength. If they can continue to do so consistently, then I believe that the work of suppressing bandits and banning opium in the two provinces of Sichuan and Kang will be fully implemented, and economic construction and political transformation will be able to make rapid progress.

Furthermore, the work of the colleagues of this meeting participating in the military discipline inspection tour the year before last had a great effect on the rectification of military discipline in the front. I hope that the colleagues of this session will continue to carry forward this spirit of personal practice, so that it can be carried forward and magnified. In the important period of economic combat, if the colleagues of this meeting can not avoid hard work and give investigation and inspection to the national transportation transportation cause, and contribute to the government for adoption, then its benefit to resistance and nation-building is limitless.

In short, what I hope for from the colleagues of this meeting today is that all of you should understand the earnest expectations of the people and the seriousness of your responsibilities, and contribute your spiritual ability to the cause of resistance and nation-building with the government's intimate spirit, working together harmoniously, so as to complete the historical mission undertaken by this meeting.

Editorial

### Milestone of Democratic Victory

The "Lease-Lend Act," which had been discussed by the US Senate and House of Representatives for two months, was finally passed completely by an overwhelming vote. In terms of the real international situation, it will guarantee and promote the victory of democratic countries such as China, Britain, and Greece; in terms of the future of human civilization, it will herald the expansion of democracy and the ultimate destruction of violent autocracy; and the bill itself and its establishment process are precisely the products of the democratic spirit, specifically illustrating the greatness of its power. If we consider China's protracted war of resistance, Britain's isolated defense against violence, and Greece's daring to embrace the fierce front, as clearing the way for democracy and expanding the road to victory, then the US move is an important milestone on the road to victory.

This bill has undergone a two-month discussion process; the traditional motto of democratic countries is "slow but sure," and this spirit permeates the US move thoroughly. During this period, countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan once made a gesture, attempting to threaten and lure the United States to abandon this bill, and isolationists in the United States also tried to obstruct and kill its establishment, but it was finally passed. It is especially worth noting that President Roosevelt's political opponent Wilkie always abandoned the prejudice of the opposing party and enthusiastically supported this bill; in addition, many people who opposed this bill, except for a very small number who may still hold stubborn prejudices, also decided to fully accept and abide by it after this bill became a national policy. All of this proves the overwhelming power of public reason and public opinion under the democratic system, as well as the efficiency of the democratic system. When dictatorship and violence are rampant for a while, the victorious achievements of this democratic spirit are really valuable and important.

Of course, the countries that are fighting for democracy on the front line are undoubtedly China, Britain, Greece, and other countries. The targets of the aid provided by this US bill are also these countries; the ultimate goal is to help democratic countries win. According to this bill, the United States has almost expressed its determination to use any method to achieve the goal. Turning the United States completely into "the arsenal of democratic countries" is the first and the minimum item. From then on, the United States will mobilize all its resources and strength to rush to build war tools; but the method and meaning are not for profit, not for trade, so it is not a sale but completely "lease," which is aid. Its final scope is not even limited to the resources of the United States alone. Wherever the power of the United States can be used, such as Central and South America, it will eventually belong to this "arsenal" system and become the rear base for the overall democratic countries to fight. Furthermore, from a further observation, the actual position of the United States in the two major wars in the East and West, although it has not legally participated in the war and is not a belligerent country, in fact, it can be said that it has partially participated in the war by means of weapon participation. Under this understanding, the United States should not only be satisfied with providing war tools to China, Britain, Greece, and other countries, expressing its sympathy as a third country, but will actively plan for the conditions and strategies for the victory of all democratic countries; and the establishment of the so-called "highest authority" will take comprehensive planning as its biggest mission! According to rumors, Mr. Corley, who returned from China, and Mr. Hopkins, who returned from Britain, will all be recruited into this organization, precisely to thoroughly understand the current needs and actual situation of China and Britain to determine the type and quantity of aid it provides. In this situation, the United States is not only the "arsenal" of various democratic countries, but also a strong reserve army in terms of material resources. Looking at the actual situation, the issue of the transportation of military supplies occupied a very important position in the process of the establishment of this US bill; and the result of the discussion and voting only inserted such a provision: this bill, "does not implicitly authorize the government, especially to allow American ships to transport military supplies in war zones"; and the proposal absolutely prohibiting American ships from entering war zones put forward by the isolationists was rejected; in contrast, it can be regarded as the participation of American ships in transporting military supplies, retaining the greatest possibility. In case Germany, Italy, and Japan announce a blockade or obstruction of the transportation of military supplies, then the United States will of course eliminate this kind of obstacle and evolve into a crisis of frontal conflict. So it exists anytime and anywhere. Therefore, according to this bill, the participation of the United States in the war is only a secondary formal issue. The most important point is to find and guarantee the victory of democratic countries by all possible means.

Furthermore, from the process of the establishment of this US bill, its most fundamental significance is obviously still to help China, Britain, Greece, and other countries to win; in other words, what is negative is to defeat those who are bad, and what is positive is to unite and cooperate with the common ideals of all just forces in the world to create the world of the future. It is not difficult to imagine that China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Greece, Turkey, and all other countries that cherish independence and freedom are in the ranks of the human civilization crusade.

### The Second National Political Council's First General Assembly: Government Reports, Review Opinions, and Resolutions
Hopes for Actively Promoting the Establishment of a Popular Opinion Organ; Foreign Policy Still Adapting to the International Environment; Hope that the Government Takes Responsibility for the Seriousness of Military Discipline

Chongqing – This session of the National Political Council held its first assembly, and the ministers of the government gave detailed reports on the administration over the past ten months. After listening to the reports, the council referred them to various review committees for detailed examination, providing opinions for consideration. These opinions were solemnly decided upon by the assembly. The following is a selection of the main points of the resolutions:

(1) Internal Affairs: During the war, efforts to reform internal affairs have been commendable, and progress in anti-opium measures has been rapid. The disaster relief agencies and the allocation of relief funds, as well as the number of people rescued, have been quite detailed. There has also been progress in Mongolian and Tibetan administration, which is gratifying. However: (1) Regarding internal affairs, the implementation of the new county system has largely begun in various provinces. It is hoped that more practical solutions will be found to the difficulties of talent and finance. At the same time, it is advisable to investigate the implementation situation to facilitate improvement. It is hoped that the establishment of popular opinion organs will be actively promoted to advance the implementation of local self-government. It is particularly hoped that detailed plans will be made for training the people to exercise the four powers, so that there will be a path to follow. In the future, special attention should be paid to the selection, assessment, reward, and punishment of administrative personnel at all levels, so that official governance can be effectively improved. It is also necessary to unify administrative orders and strictly require provincial and county governments to implement them thoroughly, so that administrative efficiency can be increased. The postponement of the National Assembly is due to military exigencies, inconvenient transportation, and limitations of fact, which are unavoidable. However, it is still hoped that election matters will be completed as soon as possible, so that the National Assembly can be convened as scheduled. In addition, regarding land administration, it is hoped that the rear provinces will implement it as soon as possible within a possible range to benefit the people's livelihood. (2) Regarding disaster relief, there are many disaster relief agencies established in various places. In the future, it is hoped that more attention will be paid to assessment and evaluation to maximize efficiency. The number of disaster victims and refugees who have not been accommodated is still considerable, and investigations and statistics should be carried out to continue to find ways to provide relief. (3) Regarding anti-opium measures, the functions of the anti-opium commission should be strengthened, and its funding should be increased. The efforts of anti-smuggling should be strengthened, its organization should be tightened, and it should be promoted universally without regional distinction, so that smokers, sellers, and transporters will have something to avoid. All existing opium soil, or those seized in the future, should be burned. Those reserved for pharmaceutical use should be jointly kept in custody by the relevant authorities to ensure prudence. (4) Regarding Mongolia and Tibet, attention should be paid to the selection of personnel sent to work in Mongolian and Tibetan areas, whether they are competent. Their work performance should also be assessed to enhance efficiency and avoid wasting national funds. Mongolian and Tibetan youth should be actively cultivated for the development and construction of Mongolia and Tibet.

(2) Foreign Affairs: The foreign affairs report resolution recognizes that the foreign policy adopted by the government is still able to adapt to changes in the international environment and meets the needs of our country's war. The assistance given to our country by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom in spirit and material is deeply inspiring to all our people, and the Assembly expresses its sincere gratitude. However, it is necessary to strengthen the ties between the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, to build a bulwark against aggression, and to lay the foundation for safeguarding peace. Diplomatic relations with the countries of the South Pacific should be urgently established or strengthened. Foreigners are now enticing other countries to recognize the puppet organization. Our country should reiterate its solemn position that anyone who recognizes the puppet organization is a public enemy of our country and should sever all relations with them. As for the reform of diplomatic institutions, the refreshment of diplomatic personnel, the collection of international intelligence, and the intensification of overseas propaganda, it is hoped that these will be effectively improved so as to be able to shoulder the heavy responsibilities during and after the war. The contributions of overseas Chinese to the war are very great, and the government should effectively protect them and grant them encouragement.

(3) Military Affairs: The military report resolution first expresses satisfaction with the Supreme Commander's coordination with allied countries to inspire the military and civilians to resolutely fight for the final victory during the drastic changes in the European war and the changing situation in the Far East as Japan advances southward. It also expresses admiration for the achievements in the provinces of Hubei and Henan, the continued implementation of military reorganization plans, the efforts in education and political training, the unified control of transportation and communication, the enrichment of armed equipment, and the improvement of conscription administration. It is particularly hoped that the government will take effective responsibility for the strict rectification of military discipline, as the final victory of the war of resistance is premised on the unification of domestic military administration and military orders. If the internal armies do not obey orders, are not subject to command, or even act freely, destroying laws and disrupting discipline, it will inevitably weaken the national strength internally and be taken advantage of by the enemy externally. The mutiny of the New Fourth Army was an unfortunate incident since the war began. This council believes that military orders must be unified and military discipline must be strict. The future military construction policy lies in following the declaration made to this council by Chairman Chiang, that the army belongs to the state, so that the national army stands under unified military orders, unified command, and unified management. Those who destroy laws, disrupt discipline, and disobey military orders will not be tolerated. For future military planning and the strengthening of equipment, the government should implement them to speed up the victory of the war. (To be continued in the eleventh day telegram)

### Construction Bonds: Purchase Methods

Chongqing – It has recently been announced by the Ministry of Finance that the construction bonds of the 29th year of the Republic of China can be purchased with foreign currency according to the exchange rate, that is, one yuan of legal tender is equivalent to four and a half pence of British gold, and one hundred yuan of legal tender is equivalent to seven and a half US dollars, and can be calculated at 98% of the face value.

### February Statistical Output of Sichuan Province

According to the Commodity Inspection Bureau, although the exports of hog bristles and sheep casings from Sichuan Province in February were less than in January, the export of sheepskin to Hong Kong and the export of white silk via the Yunnan-Burma Road increased significantly.

It is estimated that Japan can mobilize 7 or 8 divisions for southward use, with Singapore as one of the main targets. (Eleventh day Reuters telegram)

### Remains of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Plane Found in Hunan

Chongqing – The CNAC plane that mysteriously disappeared en route from Hong Kong to Chongqing on February 12 has been found. The company's pilot discovered the wreckage of the plane on a peak of Jiangjia Mountain. This mountain, which is 7,000 feet high, is located in Daoxian (under the jurisdiction of Hunan), on the border of Hunan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces. Since two of the company's pilots discovered the wreckage of the plane last Saturday, the local authorities have sent 200 laborers to the scene. According to the latest news received here, the wreckage of the plane is located on a 75-degree slope, 100 feet below the peak. The laborers can only reach a point 200 yards away. The cause of the accident seems to be a hurricane. The plane was blown against the peak. The three people on board (the pilot, co-pilot, and a bank employee) died immediately. The rumor that the pilots starved to death is unreliable, as the canned food they were carrying was untouched. (Eleventh day Reuters telegram)

### Dr. Baker Arrives in Chongqing, To Take New Position

Chongqing – Dr. Baker arrived here by plane from Hong Kong today to discuss the preliminary details of taking over as President of the Yunnan-Burma Road Committee. It is learned that Chairman Chiang asked Dr. Baker to take on the position two weeks ago. The doctor also said that if he could resign from his position at the American Red Cross, he would accept the new position. The American Red Cross has now approved his resignation. It is understood that after an agreement is reached on the detailed plan for reorganizing the traffic management of the road and the matters of jurisdiction, Dr. Baker will be officially appointed. All parties, both Chinese and foreign, here have given favorable comments on the far-reaching reorganization plan to increase traffic on the road. It is said that this plan coincides with the passage of the American Lend-Lease Act, which will greatly increase American aid to China. Dr. Baker's experience in famine relief, dike construction, and transportation in China makes it believed here that he can cooperate with the Chinese authorities to quickly obtain aid to China from the United States and other foreign countries.

New Orleans – Secretary of the Navy Knox stated here that "the situation of the democratic countries is now very critical, and the world is closer to the horrors of war than it was 90 days ago." He believes that Britain has been defeated, but has not been conquered, so he urged the United States to have the strongest two-ocean navy in the world, the strongest air force, and an army equal to other countries. He also said, "Germany has created the most powerful war machine in the world, and we cannot ignore it. The reason why our country is still safe today is thanks to the sea power and air power of Britain." (Eleventh day United Press telegram)

Washington – It was learned here yesterday that the US Navy is planning to build a base worth US$400,000,000 for "a large number of expeditionary landing ships." This matter is related to the preparation of the expeditionary force. This plan is contained in the report of Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, and has been submitted to the Naval Act. The release of this matter follows closely after the Senate's approval of the expansion of the Naval Act. At the same time, the Senate also approved another huge naval budget step.

The Senate also approved the fourth national defense supplementary bill, worth US$1,533,000,000, of which US$35,000,000 is used for the construction of a naval base on the island of Puerto Rico. The most important of President Roosevelt's recent requests to Congress is the request for US$113,000,000 to purchase naval artillery and ammunition during extraordinary times, and it includes US$63,000,000 to immediately purchase 12 cargo ships for transporting ammunition and supplies. The President's request was not leaked in advance. (Eleventh day United Press telegram)

Washington – The Senate yesterday verbally approved US$242,000,000 for naval and public works expenses, authorizing limited fortifications on Guam and building air force bases on the Atlantic islands acquired from Britain.

### The US Lend-Lease Act Completes Final Procedures; Becomes Law Upon Presidential Signature

Washington – The House of Representatives agreed to limit the final stage of debate on the Lend-Lease Act to two hours, bringing the completion of the final procedures of the bill closer. The members of the House unanimously supported the final debate, which should be carried out by receiving all the amendments passed by the Senate in a single vote. Texas Democratic Representative Rayburn said that if the Lend-Lease Act is completed today, President Roosevelt intends to submit the first request for funds for the bill to Congress on Wednesday. The amount of funds is still uncertain, ranging from 10 billion to 30 billion. Rayburn and Vice President Wallace and Senator Barkley (Senate Majority Leader) held a meeting for the fund request.

Washington – There is now reason to believe that President Roosevelt will announce the transfer of another batch of destroyers to Britain after signing the Lend-Lease Act. This is an important step for the President to immediately implement the Lend-Lease Act within a week. People here believe that since the Lend-Lease Act has been passed, those who previously opposed it will now vote to support the funds needed for the act, because they feel that since the country wants this act, the country should go all out to support it, and give it support short of entering the war. (Eleventh day Reuters telegram)

Washington – Senator Vandenberg told reporters yesterday that in two roll call votes, the number of senators who supported helping Britain with the Lend-Lease Act or with a substitute method of 20 billion debt proposed by Senator Taft each accounted for 89 of the 95 senators.

### Agreement Signed in Tokyo: Vietnamese-Thai Peace Achieved, France and Vietnam Painfully Cede Territory to Thailand, Japan Praises Its Diplomatic Success

Tokyo - The Thai-Vietnamese peace plan proposed by Japan was signed by the plenipotentiary representatives of the three countries at the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence at 4:00 PM today (3:00 PM Shanghai time). According to this plan, France was forced to cede vast territories of Laos and Cambodia to Thailand. The lands that Vietnam had repeatedly acquired from Thailand through treaties in the 19th and 20th centuries have now been lost again. With France ceding land to Thailand, peace is formally restored, and the border disputes between the two countries are resolved. These border disputes had caused numerous conflicts until Japan intervened as a mediator early last month, leading to a ceasefire. After the signing of the peace treaty, the Japanese Foreign Ministry declared that it "lays the cornerstone for building the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and stated that Japan would not tolerate any obstruction to this process. The statement claimed that a certain third country had tried to obstruct the negotiations, but peace was ultimately restored due to the goodwill and cooperative attitude of the French and Thai governments. The statement did not specify which third country it was referring to, but affirmed that such obstruction would not be tolerated. Before Japan signed the treaty, the French government insisted on modifying a portion of the Japanese proposal regarding the cession of territory. It is understood that under the terms signed today, France will retain a portion of the land that Japan originally required France to cede to Thailand based on Thailand's original demands. (Eleventh, United Press Dispatch)

Key Points of the Treaty

(1) France cedes to Thailand (a) the Barclay area as described in Article 2 of the Franco-Siamese Convention of February 13, 1904; (b) land north of the boundary line between the provinces of Battambang and Siem Reap; (c) land on the right bank of the Mekong River, bounded on the south by the southernmost point where a line extending northward from a certain point touches the line between Great Laos and the provinces of Siem Reap and Battambang. However, a small area opposite Stung Treng remains part of Vietnam. (2) The ceded territories will be demilitarized zones. French and Vietnamese residents will enjoy absolutely equal treatment with Thai citizens in terms of entry, residence, and occupation. (3) The Thai government is willing to respect the royal tombs of the Luang Prabang royal family located in the triangular area opposite Luang Prabang and provide facilities for their preservation and worship. (4) The Mekong River boundary line will be delineated according to the main deep channel, with two islands under Thai sovereignty but jointly administered by France and Thailand. French constructions currently on the islands will remain French property.

Exchange of letters between Japan and France and between Japan and Thailand clarifies the agreement for mediation. Japan guarantees the precise nature of the dispute based on the above-mentioned mediation conditions. Agreements on maintaining peace in Greater East Asia and laying the foundation for and enhancing particularly close relations between Japan and Thailand and between Japan and Vietnam will be discussed later. (Eleventh, Reuters Dispatch)

Matsuoka's Speech

Foreign Minister Matsuoka delivered a speech at the afternoon meeting today as follows: Since the opening of the conference to resolve the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute, the first official meeting was convened on February 7. Since then, representatives from the countries involved and the mediator have held informal talks daily with a sincere attitude. Thanks to the spirit of mutual understanding and concession between the French and Thai representatives, and the unyielding efforts of the mediating country, a consensus was happily reached, and the compromise was confirmed today by the signatures of the three parties, France, Thailand, and Japan. This negotiation thus concluded satisfactorily just over a month after the opening of the mediation conference. Henceforth, friendly relations between France and Thailand have been restored, and the connection of co-existence and co-prosperity among the three parties is even more concrete, making a considerable contribution to the construction of Greater East Asia and world peace, which is truly worthy of celebration. The signing ceremony took place in the hall of the Prime Minister's official residence. The three parties' representatives signed at 4:05 PM. The French and Thai representatives used fountain pens, while Matsuoka and Matsumiya used calligraphy brushes. After Matsuoka's speech, French Ambassador Henri rose to deliver a speech, thanking him for his efforts in promoting the compromise. (Eleventh, Reuters Dispatch)

Vietnamese Economy Heavily Losses

French sources in Saigon do not place much importance on the loss of Vietnamese land resulting from the Tokyo Agreement, and predict that indigenous people dissatisfied with Thailand will cause difficulties for Thailand, but admit that France's prestige has been damaged as a result. The general commentary by French sources on the Tokyo Agreement is "The loss of land certainly damages our country's prestige, but it is not economically significant." These people point out that the 18,000 square miles of land lost to Thailand is less than one-twentieth of the total area of Vietnam. Of this, only the provinces of Battambang and Siem Reap (both transliterations) are economically important, while the other areas in Laos are poor and sparsely populated. However, as a result of being forced to cede the two provinces of Battambang and Siem Reap, France will lose some of the most valuable rice-producing areas in Vietnam. These two provinces produce 250,000 tons of the best rice annually. However, this figure is small compared to the more than five million tons of rice produced in southern Vietnam. These areas also produce 100,000 tons of corn and have a large export of pepper. In addition, the French will lose the large sapphire mine near Pailin south of Battambang, the famous ancient sites and temples of Angkor, part of the 50,000-ton annual fishery harvest from the Great Lake, and some rubber plantations. The main indigenous people in the lost areas are the Khmer people, whose ancestors helped build the great temples of Angkor. The Khmer people are very dissatisfied with the Thai people, so once the French withdraw, there will inevitably be disputes between them and the Thai people. (Eleventh, United Press Dispatch)

### Germany to Intensify Offensive After Clear Weather in Europe, Focusing Attack on British Maritime Transport, Britain Considering Ways to Defeat Submarines

Rome - The conservative newspaper Vorlandsera reports that the spring weather will intensify the Axis powers' offensive in Europe and ease Britain's war effort in East Africa. The warm weather is very useful for military operations in Northeastern Europe, the English Channel, and the North Sea, while Africa is either hot or subject to heavy rain, unsuitable for military operations. (Eleventh, United Press Dispatch)

London - A Reuters naval correspondent says that in his last speech, Hitler threatened that Germany would intensify the maritime war on an unprecedented scale. Now that the weather is gradually improving and the season for operations has arrived, it is expected that Germany will exert all its strength in the Atlantic to cut off Britain's lifeline of food and war supplies. With the US Lend-Lease Act passed tonight, Germany cannot but devote itself to this in order to stop US supplies to Britain. Last year, Germany occupied a coastline of 2,000 miles in Europe, which is a new problem that the British Navy and Air Force are trying to cope with with greater determination. After the US Lend-Lease Act becomes law, the British Navy further increases its responsibility for escorting ships. The main naval battle locations are expected to be northwest of Britain and east of Iceland, where British ships are equipped with new submarine detection equipment and are now working closely with the British Air Force day and night in preparation for naval battles. According to reliable estimates, Germany has between 100 and 150 submarines available, but not all of these submarines can be at sea at the same time. Britain is currently considering all possible ways to defeat submarines. Its best scientists are racking their brains to improve the tools for detecting submarines and defending aircraft, and the issue of escorting is currently under close attention by the authorities. (Eleventh, Reuters Dispatch)

London - A Reuters air force correspondent says that the strength of the British Air Force in the Middle East and the Balkans continues to grow. Although the Italian threat has diminished, the German air threat has increased. However, the British Air Force is strong enough not only to contain the German Air Force but also to expand its range of activities, independently attacking enemy territory or covering the army, and will always take the initiative. The weather in Southeast Europe will soon clear up, and the Air Force will be able to carry out more extensive activities. The weather in Africa will worsen, making it difficult for the Air Force to operate. Hitler is now trying to save the country from collapse and protect his rear while preparing to attack the bases of British interests. It is estimated that Germany currently has about 1,000 aircraft assembled to operate on both sides of the Mediterranean. Currently, the German Air Force has invaded Bulgaria from Romania and established bases on the Greek border and near the Black Sea, with oil supplied by the Soviet Union transported via the Black Sea. Other major bases of the German Air Force are in Italy and Sicily, and there are also a small number of German aircraft in Libya and the Dodecanese Islands. British aircraft are not very active in the skies over Germany and the occupied areas, probably due to weather conditions. However, the Germans are well aware of the danger of the next British attack and frequently make their people take shelter quickly in the event of an air raid. (Eleventh, Reuters Dispatch)

Berlin - German military experts commenting on the war situation say that during the World War, the Dover and Northern artillery, extending from the Shetland Islands to the Norwegian coast, exerted extraordinary power. Britain then blocked the two exits of the Atlantic with warships and mines, so Germany was isolated from the outside world. Since Germany's victory last year, Germany's situation is the opposite of that during the World War. The artillery at those two locations has already fired at Britain. The sea lanes west of Ireland and the North and St. George's Channels have become "dead ends" for British shipping. Britain is using convoys and single ships to alleviate the difficulty of supplying Britain. The cost paid by Britain can be seen from the loss of British ships. Sometimes British ships take advantage of the dim night to smuggle through the German blockade line, but German naval and air forces and long-range coastal artillery still inflict heavy losses on Britain. This can be proven by the total annihilation of many British convoys. (Eleventh, Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

Britain Will Clear German Presence at Sea

Somewhere in the Mediterranean - British Mediterranean Fleet Commander Admiral Cunningham told reporters yesterday that British planes and artillery will drive the German Air Force out of the Mediterranean, just as the Italian Air Force lost its momentum months ago. Admiral Cunningham received reporters on his flagship at a secret location in the Mediterranean. When reporters asked if the German Air Force would defeat the British fleet once launched, Mr. Cunningham replied, "At the beginning of the war, the Italian Air Force was very active against our navy. Now it's the Germans' turn. The German Air Force is clearly superior to the Italian one. The Germans clashed with us in the Strait of Sicily at the beginning of the war, and the results were obvious. At the beginning of the war, we did not have the necessary defensive weapons and were caught off guard. I believe the German presence in the Mediterranean will be cleared soon, just like the Italian one. We already know how to defeat the Italian Air Force. Italian warplanes have not fought against our fleet since last December." (Eleventh, International Dispatch)

### Heavy Casualties Among Italian Troops in Albania, Many Important Italian Figures Killed in Action

London - Yesterday, Greek troops in Albania launched a fierce large-scale offensive against the Italian army's central area for the fourth consecutive day. According to Athens Radio last night, Greek troops are advancing with great determination. Italian troops on the two mountain ridges where the Greek troops began their attack have now been completely cleared out. Italian machine gun outposts hidden deep in the rocks have been driven out, suffering heavy casualties, with some entire units annihilated. One unit defending the outer defenses of Tepelene (an important town on the way to the port of Vlorë) suffered heavy losses. Soldiers of the 7th Blackshirt Battalion were almost entirely killed in action. Among the Italian enemies, a member of the Fascist Administrative Council, Beligreni, was killed, and the commander of a large Italian unit that was annihilated was the Italian Minister of Education, Bottai, who may have died. According to Greek newspaper reports yesterday, Bottai and two other senior officials have been killed in action. A telegram from Mussolini to Bottai was found on the body of an Italian major, asking Bottai to do everything in his power to stop the Greek advance, and saying, "Otherwise, Fascism will be disgraced and die. The last hope of Fascist Italy rests on your defense. Please save it." (Eleventh, Reuters Dispatch)

Athens - The strategically important Tepelene is the gateway to the "Hindenburg Line." Yesterday, it was reported that Greek troops were about to occupy the city. Yesterday was the fourth day of the major battle since the start of the war. It is reported that Greek troops have occupied several positions on the mountain front. It is widely believed that the Greek High Command is now making its greatest effort to break through the Italian defenses before German troops arrive in Thessaloniki. After the occupation of Tepelene, it will force the Italian troops to retreat north to the positions between Durazzo and Elbasan and allow thousands of Greek troops to move east to Macedonia. Athens Radio stated that in the battles in the central sector of the Albanian front in the last two days, 3,000 Italian officers and soldiers were captured. It also stated that Greek troops launched a fierce attack on the mountainside, capturing various war trophies. It is generally believed here that this victory is as important as the occupation of Këlcyrë. (Eleventh, International Dispatch)

### German-Yugoslav Friendship Treaty Under Negotiation, It is Said Yugoslav Prime Minister Will Go to Vienna in a Few Days, Britain, the United States, and Germany Are Exerting Pressure on Yugoslavia

Capital of Yugoslavia - Cabinet Minister and Croatian leader Maček went to Čigelj for a weekend vacation on the eighth of this month. He was originally scheduled to return to the capital tomorrow or the day after, but he returned here this morning. Therefore, it is generally expected that the government will decide today how to approach Germany. One theory is that Yugoslavia will sign a treaty of friendship with Germany. Yugoslav Prime Minister Cvetković and Foreign Minister Marković will fly to Germany tomorrow and sign the treaty in the next few days. Another theory is that a German plane has landed at the Zaitmühle airfield in Yugoslavia to welcome the Yugoslav Prime Minister to Germany. According to the latest news, opposition members of the Yugoslav parliament, various patriotic organizations, and the British and American envoys are currently exerting great pressure on the Yugoslav government, opposing the signing of a treaty of friendship with Germany. However, the pressure from Germany is also not weak. Generally, opposition members of parliament have stated that the government should not make any decisions before Cabinet Minister Maček returns to the capital. The government then decided to summon Minister Maček back to the capital early to discuss this matter. Regarding this matter, political figures here said that the government will do its best to make as few concessions as possible when dealing with Germany, and that these concessions must be in accordance with the principle of defending sovereignty. In short, Yugoslavia does not want to sign a general agreement to cooperate with the Axis powers, but only wants to establish a treaty of non-aggression and cooperation with Germany. (Tenth, Havas Dispatch)

Capital of Yugoslavia - It has been widely rumored that Prime Minister Cvetković and Foreign Minister Marković will go to Germany today to sign a non-aggression pact, but it was suddenly heard that the trip has been postponed. According to news from Berlin, the postponement of the trip by the Yugoslav authorities was proposed by the German side. German officials are said to be deeply dissatisfied with the Yugoslav government's procrastination. They believe that signing a non-aggression pact is actually beneficial to Yugoslavia. Germany originally had no intention of forcing Yugoslavia to accept it, and now that Yugoslavia has many internal difficulties, it can be left to its own devices. (Eleventh, Havas News Agency Dispatch)

Capital of Yugoslavia - It is expected that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković will leave for Vienna at any time to sign a treaty of friendship between Yugoslavia and the Axis powers. It is rumored that Marković has already departed, and the treaty may be signed today. At the same time, Yugoslavia continues to mobilize troops on a large scale. The tone of Bulgarian newspapers advocating border revisions is becoming increasingly intense. Former Bulgarian Chief of Staff General Hristov told Bulgarian students yesterday, "We are living in a turbulent period. After this period, our country's ideals will be realized." Yugoslav newspapers have published General Hristov's remarks and the demands of Bulgarian newspapers for border revisions. (Eleventh, Reuters Dispatch)

Belgrade - Well-informed diplomatic circles revealed this morning that Germany has demanded that Yugoslavia sign a German-Italian-Japanese military agreement, and not just a non-aggression pact. It is said that the sudden postponement of Prime Minister Cvetković and Foreign Minister Marković's trip to Berlin was due to this reason. It is rumored that German envoy to Yugoslavia Herren has notified Marković that Germany is not satisfied with the German-Yugoslav non-aggression pact. What Germany wants is Yugoslavia's accession to the Axis. Although this news cannot yet be confirmed, it is certain that the Yugoslav politicians' trip, originally scheduled for Monday evening, has been postponed until the weekend in order to "resolve some technical issues." Rumors are spreading that Cvetković's cabinet is divided on the issue of how close Yugoslavia should be to the Axis powers. Today, this claim has been denied by Yugoslav officials. (Eleventh, International Dispatch)

London - Today, The Times commentator reviewed the military situation in the Balkans, predicting that the British government will take major decisions within a few days, and said that in fact it may have already taken them. The main key at present is still Yugoslavia. Two things are very clear: the increasing Nazi oppression and the disapproval of all levels of the Yugoslav people of cooperating with the Axis powers. There are various indications that the attitude of Yugoslavia is firm. If the Nazis attempt to violate its neutrality in order to attack Greece, Yugoslavia will resist. Turkey has repeatedly stated its loyalty to its treaty obligations and will participate in the struggle at the most advantageous time for the Allied countries to assist its allied countries. British Foreign Secretary Eden's discussions in Ankara and Athens have been fruitful. Before common action, there must be a common policy to guide it. (Eleventh, Reuters Dispatch)

London - Authorities here said today that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps immediately visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky after returning to Moscow from Turkey. It is understood that they discussed events in the Balkans and the Near East. They said that the meeting was very cordial. (Eleventh, Taiwan Public Dispatch)

### British Ships Sunk, Obstructing the Suez Canal

Rome - According to Romanian sailors arriving today at the Black Sea port of Constanta, four British ships were sunk by German and Italian bombers, so the Suez Canal has been partially blocked. This group of 34 Romanian sailors were crew members from Romanian oil tankers captured by the British fleet several weeks ago. They arrived in Constanta aboard the Romanian ship Dacia. They claimed that it would take weeks for Britain to remove the sunken ships from the Suez Canal. (Eleventh, United Press Dispatch)

Cairo - The Ministry of Interior issued a public statement saying that the Suez Canal area was bombed this morning, but there was no damage or casualties as a result. (Eleventh, Reuters Dispatch)

### The Authorities Did Not Adopt Severe Measures; Rice Prices Rose Again Yesterday; They Also Know the Security Situation Is Grave, But Hint at Implementing Price Controls as the Limit

American Rice is of Good Quality and May Be Available for Sale

Local rice market: In the source of rice, Wang, in the situation where the authorities claimed that they would soon implement severe punishment measures, fell once the day before yesterday, and suddenly rose again yesterday by two or four yuan. The "premium" was increased to 2,500 yuan per hundred bags. The speculators' methods are becoming more and more vicious. Regardless of how abundant the source is, all are hoarded by these people to reduce the spot goods in the market and achieve their purpose of wantonly raising prices. In addition to some people having a large amount of capital, they also use special forces to carry out their illegal activities. It is said that each warehouse along the Pudong River currently hoards about one million bags of rice. This amount of rice is still being hoarded. It is hoped that the authorities of the concession and all relevant parties will break through their feelings and engage in thorough investigation, and strive to find the truth to resolve the chaos and quell the floating rumors.

Price Control of Rice Adopts New Measures

The Shanghai Times reports that the food situation in Shanghai is becoming increasingly serious. All parties are anxiously awaiting action from the authorities. Until yesterday (the – day), the responsible party stated that the authorities of the two concessions and the "city" are preparing to adopt new measures, intending to intensify the control of rising rice prices and improve the general rice situation. It is noted that in the past few days, the government has remained silent on the serious rice situation. The public acquiesced that the authorities were in a difficult situation. Until yesterday, the government gave some hints and said that the reason for the silence in the past few days was that the authorities of the two concessions and the "municipal government" all believed that empty words would not help the matter. Therefore, the authorities changed their silent attitude and must regard it as a promising sign.

The Authorities Explained the Limits of Their Power: The authorities explained again yesterday that their powers are subject to strict limitations and emphasized that the three parties will now cooperate prudently to improve the recognized serious situation. The authorities will focus on the implementation of price limits and carefully investigate the purchase price and freight of rice so as to accurately know what the fair retail price of rice is. The three parties all feel that close, unified action will exert a stronger influence on the rice situation. However, the power to truly control it is legally limited.

Last Week's Meeting Reached an Agreement

It is reported that representatives from the two concessions and the "city" held an important meeting on the rice situation last week on the 1st, and a basic agreement has been reached. However, the details have not yet been announced. The authorities are also working closely with the Shanghai Rice and Bean Industry Association and repeatedly engage in consultations. Although government officials say that the authorities can only take supervisory actions, they express their deep belief that the formulation of a decisive plan and its consistent implementation can be effective. The current rice situation is extremely difficult. In addition to speculation and manipulation, there are also political situations, economic chaos, and a shortage of ships. If the actual and potential dangers are eliminated, this problem can be solved soon.

Yesterday's Rice Market Manipulations Intensified

The English Great Beauty Evening News reports that the city's rice prices reached a new high this morning (the 11th). The first-class real rice is 104 yuan per picul, the first-class tribute rice is 98 yuan, and the cheapest foreign rice is also 96 yuan. Only the first-class domestic rice is still sold for 125 yuan, which is the same price as yesterday (the 10th). Although it was rumored this morning that 250,000 bags of foreign rice would arrive in Shanghai this week, manipulators and hoarders are still willing to pay any price to buy as much as possible. A major rice merchant said that the soaring rice prices are all due to the rampant manipulators. Retail rice shops also have to purchase from manipulators, so the responsibility for high rice prices does not lie with retail rice shops. The statement that the Rice Evaluation Committee will cooperate with the authorities of the two concessions to take strict actions has no effect on the rice market this morning. The date of the meeting of the Municipal Council directors to discuss the rice situation has not yet been announced because the authorities refuse to comment on the rice situation. The official price limit for first-class tribute rice is 87 yuan, but the price of the worst tribute rice this morning has exceeded this number by ten yuan.

Red Cross Relief Rice Is of Good Quality

This newspaper yesterday reported that the batch of 8,000 bags of American-produced relief rice from the American Red Cross, which arrived in Shanghai on the President Asquith, is of excellent quality and is produced in the United States and requires formal investigation. Now we have received a letter from the American Melon Foreign Firm, which stated, "Our firm is the Far East agent of the American Louisiana Rice Mill, which is the largest rice mill in the United States. However, the southern provinces of the United States, such as Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, are rich in rice grains, and California also has a small amount of production. The climate and soil of the above provinces are similar to those of the rice-producing areas in China. Therefore, the officials are in charge of rice cultivation. This season's output is estimated to be 600,000 wishes, most of which will be shipped for export. Your newspaper said that the quality of this batch of rice is better than that of Saigon or Siam and is similar to Chinese rice. However, the rice produced in Louisiana has always been famous in the world. Our firm has a full set of sample rice for personal inspection. However, the current freight is high, and shipping American rice to China is not cost-effective. However, the price of rice in Shanghai continues to soar, and Saigon restricts shipping licenses, which have not been issued for a long time, and there is no cheaper water freight available, so shipping American rice to China may soon become a reality. This matter concerns the people's food, so please record and publish the letter in one corner to comfort the people's hearts."

Rice Prices Threaten: Grabbing Steamed Buns

The Charity Relief Association uses trucks to load steamed buns and distribute them along the way every evening. This good deed is still in progress. The day before yesterday, when the association used a car to leave the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road, a large number of refugees suddenly came, swarming like a wall, vying to grab and eat the steamed buns on the truck. The association's workers could not stop them, and many were snatched away. Then, the association's staff came out to persuade them, and they dispersed after a long time. This shows that there are many poor people in Shanghai who cannot withstand the threat of rice prices, and it is very difficult to find food. The situation is extremely pitiful.

Coal Ball Prices Are Raised Privately

General speculative coal merchants continue to wreak havoc on the market, attempting to raise prices and profit. Yesterday, in addition to the slightly looser market price of bituminous coal, the market price of white coal was still quite firm. A large amount of coal dust was firmly hidden. Each major coal company can use the excuse that all the inventory in the warehouse is grouped by people holding orders and does not belong to the company, so there is no coal dust on the market. Each small coal ball factory is ready for a rainy day and has sucked up a large amount of coal dust. On the one hand, the selling price of coal balls has been privately negotiated to increase by ten yuan per ton, which has been implemented since yesterday. Today (1st), the factory price is 186 yuan per ton, plus four yuan for delivery, and the retail price per dan (100 market catties) has risen to ten yuan. Yesterday, each coal shop sold it for nine yuan six, seven, or eight jiao per dan. Although major coal ball factories claim that they will not raise prices, there is no large amount of spot goods on the market. Now, the firewood and charcoal industry will send personnel to Wenzhou and Huangyan, Zhejiang Province, to negotiate the purchase of large quantities of Wenyan firewood and charcoal. Therefore, residents can buy firewood and charcoal for their daily fuel needs in the future. It is hoped that the industry association will take both radical and stopgap measures to actively dredge the source on the one hand and suppress the market price on the other, so as to benefit the common people and stabilize the market situation.

Enduring Hardships and Encouraging Ambitions to Strive for Strength

The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters issued a notice to the people of all sectors yesterday to commemorate the death of the Prime Minister and the National Spiritual Mobilization. The general idea is that every conscious, thoughtful, passionate, and tearful person will never forget this sad and solemn anniversary of the death of the founding father of the nation and the National Spiritual Mobilization. On the 3 years and 6 months of the war today, we must be even more deeply saddened and indignant. The Prime Minister dedicated his life to seeking liberation and freedom for the nation and mankind and fought against evil environments. We commemorate the Prime Minister's death today and allow us to commemorate the Prime Minister during the war, which makes us feel the greatness of the meaning even more. However, this cannot be commemorated casually in form. We must be diligent in encouraging ambition and strive for strength. We must follow the spirit of national responsibility for the rise and fall, lying on firewood and tasting gall, living and teaching lessons, and emulate the founding father of the nation's fearless and indomitable spirit to win the victory of resistance and construction, so that we will not be ashamed of the country and will not lose the meaning of commemorating the Prime Minister.

Concessions Take Special Precautions

Today is the anniversary of the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation. Chinese residents of the city will fly flags at half-mast in mourning. The Public Concession Police will take special precautions and will be assisted by the International Volunteer Corps. The detailed precautions have not been ascertained because the police are currently keeping them secret so that they can suppress any terrorist activities with fierce actions.

### Japanese Residents Are Already Feeling Cold About the Municipal Council Board Elections; It Must Be Known That Westerners Occupy a Majority of the Elections; Even If They Compete, They Cannot Achieve Their Desires

It is still unknown what kind of actions the Japanese residents will take when the Municipal Council holds its annual board elections on April 2 and 3 because the taxpayers of Japan are keeping silent. The date of the annual board elections is not far away. It is said that the Japanese residents have not yet made preliminary preparations for the Japanese board candidates. It is reported that the British residents will hold a primary election early next week to facilitate the nomination of British board candidates. The American residents have nominated Alerman and Minsider to participate in the board elections. Some people believe that the taxpayers of Japan know that the taxpayers of the West occupy the vast majority of the election tickets, and the Japanese residents cannot achieve their desire to increase the number of Japanese boards in the Municipal Council, so they are already feeling cold about the Municipal Council board elections.

### The French Concession Is Implementing Electricity Savings Due to Fuel Shortage; New Equipment or Expansions Will Not Be Accepted; And Researching How to Save Electricity Sales in the Concession

The Shanghai Electric Power Company of the Public Concession has implemented a 30% reduction in electricity since the 5th due to fuel shortages, and the Public Works Department has planned in many ways, and new users are refused. Although the French Concession Water and Electricity Company uses diesel fuel, it has not taken parallel action immediately, but due to the instability of the Far East situation, the source of diesel fuel is more difficult than before. Therefore, after several consultations with the French Municipal Council, it has been decided to implement the first step of reducing consumption. From now on, the request for power supply to users will not be accepted. Other measures are still under consideration.

Stop Electricity and Heat for New Households

Yesterday, Tan Guti, the director of the French Municipal Council, issued a public notice on this matter, which read as follows: "For the purpose of notification, it is hereby notified to the public that the French Tram Electric Light Company will not accept any requests for the supply of electric power or heat, whether it is new equipment or the expansion of existing equipment, because the current fuel is lacking and difficult to replenish. The Bureau is now also requesting the company to study how to save the sales in the concession in the shortest possible time, except for the use of existing equipment. All know this. The notice, Tan Guti, Superintendent, One."

Diesel Fuel Source Is More Difficult Than Before

French, the general manager of the French Water and Electricity Company, told reporters yesterday that all the power generation machines of the Water and Electricity Company have been burning diesel fuel since the start of operation. Now that the source is more difficult than before and it is not easy to replenish, and in order to prevent the occurrence of more difficult situations in the future, it has been decided to temporarily adopt a method of restricting the power supply request of new users. As for the problem of power reduction, the company has now begun to investigate and research, and will announce the implementation as soon as a decision is made, but the French did not announce the specific details of the difficulty of fuel supply.

Savings Methods Are Being Studied

According to a senior official of the company who told reporters yesterday, the company has recently organized a committee to consider how to reduce the supply of current to industrial and commercial dishes in the French Concession. As soon as the committee completes its research, the company will draft a report with recommendations and submit it to the French Municipal Council for approval and promulgation.

Very Little Impact on Industry and Commerce

However, according to informed sources, the French Concession Water and Electricity Company used to use 2,000 tons of diesel fuel per month, but recently, due to the difficulty of the source, it has been reduced to 1,500 tons. The reason why the French Concession is taking restrictive power consumption measures is precisely because of this. It is said that the company's current oil reserves can still be consumed for more than three months, and the amount of oil reserves in the city is still large, so there is no panic at present. It is also said that the French Concession's annual consumption of military volume last year was 67 million degrees, and the monthly average since this year has been 600 degrees, which is less than that of the Public Concession. This is because most of the larger-scale factories and firms are in the Public Concession. Therefore, even if the French Concession implements power reduction, the impact on industry and commerce will be less.

### Only a Little More Than a Hundred American Overseas Chinese Were Evacuated from Shanghai Yesterday

The American mail ship President Pierce arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines and Hong Kong the day before yesterday and berthed at the 12th and 13th buoys. The report has been made previously.

### Shanghai Continues to Promote Daylight Saving Time; Implemented from Midnight on the 15th of This Month

The daylight saving time movement was promoted in Shanghai last summer. The concession authorities and various public and private groups cooperated fully and moved in the same direction. It has been effective in stimulating vitality, exercising physique, and improving work efficiency. It is now known that it will continue to be promoted this year. According to the announcement of the Information Office of the Public Works Department, the Bureau and the French Concession Municipal Council have jointly decided to start the daylight saving time movement from midnight on the 15th of this month (Saturday). At that time, all clocks will be advanced by one hour in accordance with the measures of the previous year. It is hoped that all sectors of the city and public and private groups will follow this method, which is most beneficial to the public.

### On the Album of Photos (Continued)

— Lang Jingshan

The scenery of the universe, the myriad phenomena, among them, there are those that make people like them, and there are also those that make people hate them, but they all come from the nature of creation, the so-called nurturing of all things, and the eye cannot exist or abandon them because of people's likes or dislikes. Therefore, Chinese painters have never made stereotyped depictions when painting the real scenery of a place. All take what they like and abandon what they hate, thinking that it is their ideal realm, and it is not far from the normal phenomenon of nature. Photography is restricted by machinery. When shooting a negative, it is impossible to remove its partial area of the overall view. Besides, if the location is not appropriate, the appropriate angle cannot be obtained. If the foreground is too close, the distant view will be submerged. If the distant view is too far, it will not be enough to set off the foreground. It is often a pity that partial imperfections destroy the whole. Today, the album of photos is suitable to remedy it, that is, Chinese calligraphers depict natural scenery, take and place as they please, and make it a complete painting. Besides, the viewfinder of the camera is actually very stiff, and cannot be compared with the impression obtained by our human vision. Therefore, when shooting a scene, it is mostly a flat perspective, and Chinese painting also has a bird's-eye view perspective. Although there is no explicit record in the painting method, it is actually the same as the impression obtained by the human eye. Therefore, its distance is clear, and the levels are well-organized. The album of photos is also based on this principle. The foreground, middle ground, and distant view can be arranged in the foot, making it complex, deep, magnificent, not only interesting, but also can obtain a better perspective.

If we consider the composition of the picture, the host and guest of the scenery, opening and closing, driving the ranks, and so on, all must be appropriate. The distribution of everything in the natural scenery has its own natural laws. However, if a part of it is taken into a small picture, it cannot be exhausted. Therefore, every time you get this, you lose that. The album of photos is to add human to the obtained parts and combine them to make it perfect. This is what Chinese painting calls business location. However, it must be carved and returned to Bai Ran before it can be magical, skillful and natural.

The collection of materials for the album of photos can be unlimited to the land, unlimited to time, unlimited to distance, and unlimited to climate. Wherever the footprints go, they can be taken at will. A flower, a tree, a water, and a stone are all sufficient as materials for the production of the album of photos, but you must make a quick plan when taking them. That is, which one is suitable for the foreground, which one is suitable for the middle ground, which one is suitable for the distant view, which one is sufficient as the theme, and which one can still set off. All must be slightly determined one by one, and collected according to the plan. After developing and drying, re-determine in detail. When making it, first check out the negatives that you want to collect into one picture, and arrange them into chapters according to the shape of the scenery, the angle of light, etc., and then draw a rough sketch in pencil on a thick piece of paper according to the size of the size to be projected, and carefully consider the position of the scenery and the mutual shadow. When the sketch is completed, prepare the projection equipment, and before projecting, put the sketch on the paper to be projected to test the scenery of the negative. If it is consistent with what I and the sketch planned, project it in turn after the test. Each projection must be checked with a sketch once to make it accurate. However, the author must have superb surgery, be quick in work, and have all the bamboo in his chest before he can be handy.

What should be paid attention to when combining in the album of photos is that the angles of the scenery of each group of negatives must be equal, the light must be in the same direction, the size of the objects must be arranged according to perspective, and the time sequence of the scenery must also be taken into account. In short, everything must be consistent with the impression obtained by human eyes in nature, otherwise it will lose its authenticity and become counterproductive. As for the same direction of light, it refers to the strong sunlight and shadows. If the weather is cloudy and the light is flat and there is no excessive black and white light and shadow, then only measure the situation to connect it. This kind of picture is also impossible to specify the direction of light. And this kind of negative is actually the most suitable material for joining, and it is easier to join than those with strong light and shadow. (To be continued)

### Wang Zuolin Kidnapping Case: Three Key Suspects Arrested, Victim Rescued, Suspects Detained for Investigation

Wang Zuolin, a native of Wuxi and owner of the Fu Chang Xiang Yan Ke shop at No. 3 Xiang Yu Lane, Da Zhu Tang Street, French Concession, residing at No. 182 Fu煦 Road, at 11:11 AM on January 6th of this year, was with his son, Zonggan, and relative, Xi Lusheng, in his private car No. 1936. As they drove through the intersection of Fu煦 Road and Dan Shui Road, a kidnapper dressed in a police uniform, but without a number, stepped forward with a gun and

ordered them to stop.

The driver, Huang Youming, mistook him for an inspector and stopped the car. Unexpectedly, four or five more people arrived, each armed with guns. They forcibly removed Wang Zonggan, Xi Lusheng, and the driver from the car. The kidnappers then drove Wang Zuolin away themselves. Wang's family reported the case to the police for investigation. After kidnapping Wang, the kidnappers confined him on a boat, sailing and anchoring near Xujiahui in the Chinese territory. They then dispatched someone to

closely monitor him,

while sending a letter to the victim's family demanding a large ransom. However, their plans were not airtight, and on February 12th, the case was cracked by the Chinese police. At that time, in addition to rescuing the victim Wang Zuolin, they also arrested three Jiangbei men guarding the victim: Zhou A'er, Shen Dalong, and Zhu Zaoxiu. A handgun was confiscated. They were taken back for investigation. Just yesterday, the Public Concession police authorities transferred Zhou, Shen, and Zhu to the

police station.

This morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated the above situation and presented the statements of various witnesses and defendants, requesting an adjournment. After a brief interrogation by the judge, the order was given to detain them for seven days for further review.

### Details of the Sinking of the Da Li Steamer

The Da Li steamer, owned by the British-owned Eastern Shipping Company, was leased this time. After loading cargo at the Bund, French Concession, on the evening of the fourth, it weighed anchor and set sail for Haikou. While sailing in the waters of Lujiazui, the engine suddenly malfunctioned. At that time, it was low tide, and the current was quite strong. The captain ordered to turn the ship around to drop anchor and be next to the Da De steamer for repairs. The ship's hull was originally pointed. The tide was very rapid at that time, and there was wind and other ships passing, causing the Da Li to be hit. The upper part of the ship collided with the Da De. Some of the cargo on the deck was shaken and overturned, falling into the Huangpu River. The ship then tilted and sank. Although the crew tried their best to save it, it was ineffective. Fortunately, no crew members were killed. It is said that the ship and cargo are currently being salvaged.

### Grain: Speculators Insatiable, Prices Jumping by 500-600 Yuan, "Deaf and Blind" Are Needed to Make a Family Prosper, Bold Speculators Drive Prices Higher and Higher, Not Afraid of Buying

Under the shroud of a speculative atmosphere, foreign rice is still being monopolized by a few households. It is impossible for people to expect it to gradually loosen. Although there are many new arrivals, they are all objects of profit for orderers. The stored goods are tools for speculators to make money. Therefore, expecting the spot goods to be sold as much as possible and the market price to return to normal is truly as difficult as seeking skin from a tiger. Speculators are not afraid of public opinion, because public opinion cannot restrain their speculation. And those who have this power, it is said that "deaf and blind" are needed to make a family prosper. Therefore, the arrogance of speculators is even greater. Moreover, since domestic rice has been plundered, they are now scouring the market for foreign rice. Big speculators rely on each other, staging a double act. But fearing that they won't do this, how can they care about millions of people without food? When the market opened early yesterday morning, the situation immediately became tense. Under-the-table prices jumped by 500-600 yuan compared to the previous day. Rumors arose, and people became panic-stricken. Prices were raised and raised, shouting louder and more expensive. Small rice jumped from 2,200-2,300 yuan to 2,600-2,700 yuan per hundred bags. Saigon No. 1 rose from 2,200-2,300 yuan to 2,700-2,800 yuan. Nos. 1 and 2 and fire rice rose from 2,200 yuan to 2,400 yuan. Even broken rice, which is meant to feed the poor, rose sharply from 1,100-1,200 yuan to 1,300-1,500 yuan. Because both customers and speculators were greedy, the total transaction volume for the day reached more than 20,000 bags.

After the sudden decline in the domestic rice market the day before, yesterday it still showed a soft state. Because it is at the top of the price, the changes are drastic, so when the early market opened, whether it was local shops or general retail households, they all waited and watched. At that time, the sales were unusually sluggish, and the market situation showed signs of another sharp decline. Unexpectedly, most cargo owners held unique views, because they saw that the goods continued to be scarce, and they heard that the under-the-table prices of foreign rice had rebounded. They did not change their original intentions due to the sluggish sales and were very firm in their intention to sell, unwilling to loosen up, causing both sides to go in opposite directions and maintain a stalemate all the way. It was not until near noon that the market announced that it would be closed for one day today to commemorate the death of the Premier. Fearing that the source would be accumulated, and that the thin rice with weak bodies would not withstand the constant changes in the weather, and the unpredictable sunshine and rain, would not be able to be put aside and would easily change, they began to slightly depreciate and sell. As a result, the market price of thin rice fell by yuan. The opening price of Qingjiao rice was 119 yuan to 118 yuan for the rice, and 122 yuan for the original package. However, Houjing was still able to maintain the return to stability, and the opening price was similar to the previous one. The price of Kunshan rice with white rice was still 121-122 yuan, and the original package was 126.5 yuan, 126 yuan. Changbang rice with special white rice was 124-125 yuan. The supply of glutinous rice was scarce, and some speculators continued to hoard it. The market was broad, and the shouting price rose repeatedly. Hong Kong's ordinary Tuanli glutinous rice had risen from 100 yuan to 102 yuan, Weili also reached 100 yuan to 99 yuan, and the middle grade also needed 97-98 yuan, which was 1-2 yuan higher than the previous market. The special high-quality goods were completely out of stock. As for glutinous mung beans, they were opened yesterday, reaching 91.5 yuan to 90 yuan.

### Speculation Runs Rampant in the Flour Market, Trading Suspended, Subsidized Flour Still Supplied, Large Quantities of Foreign Wheat Arrive in Shanghai

The current foreign flour market has been suspended, because speculative buying has been rampant in recent days, and the market has risen too sharply. For the sake of the food of the citizens, the authorities have temporarily banned market transactions. In the rapidly rising flour market, it was suddenly silent. It is said that direct distribution outside the market, although warned by the authorities, the selling price still stands at a high peak. However, outside speculators, seeing that the situation is not good, are secretly taking out the stock, and the price has loosened to within 30 yuan. The state-subsidized flour is still supplied as usual, with 8,318 bags released. In addition to the 5,873 bags supplied by the Fuxin Factory, the rest are sold with foreign flour, and the selling price is 15 yuan per bag, plus 20 cents for transportation and miscellaneous expenses.

Wheat market trading is even more a sign of stagnation. Domestic and foreign sources are scarce. The imported foreign wheat is needed by Chinese factories to make subsidized flour. The wheat in the market has long been exhausted. If you want to buy it, there is no goods. The market cannot escape the stagnant situation.

Foreign wheat is imported in batches. The Aatartia, managed by the manager of Fulai Foreign Company, imported 2,000 tons of foreign wheat from Australia, a total of more than 20,000 bags, which arrived yesterday morning and stopped at the Gonghexiang Wharf for unloading. It is also said that the LLLinois, handled by Laicilai Foreign Company, transported a large amount of foreign wheat from Canada, with a total of 6,000 tons, or about 60,000 bags. It is expected that the ship will arrive this morning. It is said that the wheat was purchased by the Fuxin Flour Mill.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Pulling Up Miscellaneous Grains, Never Letting Go

Yesterday, in the miscellaneous grains and oilseed market, except for soybeans, which continued to fall, other commodities did not loosen because the speculators were strongly walled off, resulting in the market price being raised higher and higher. Although there were slight setbacks in the middle, there were still more rises than falls. Soybean oil rose by about two yuan, with 1,200-1,300 barrels of Dalian oil being opened on a term-spot basis, and 400-500 dans of factory oil. Soybean cake rose by 10-20 cents, with more than 7,000 pieces of various brands of cake being made. Corn rose by 40-50 cents, with more than 3,000 bags of spot goods and more than 600 tons of futures being traded. The number of transactions was still considerable, but actual sales only accounted for one-third. At present, the overall situation is entirely supported by speculators. However, the trade in snowball trading is becoming more and more frequent. One day, the amount of the snowball will be too heavy and difficult to kick out.

On the 11th, 200 bags of beans were imported from Hong Kong. On the 12th, 550 bags of beans were exported to Singapore, 620 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Siam, and 100 bags of sesame seeds were shipped to Singapore.

Compared to last week, there was a significant increase of about 100 yuan, with Reel silk experiencing the most substantial rise.

### Private Schools Urge Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Directors to Increase Education Subsidies Due to High Cost of Goods Making It Difficult to Maintain Operations

Over a hundred schools in the city, including Patriotic Girls' Middle School, Kun Fan Girls' Middle School, Dao Zhong Girls' Middle School, Hudong Middle School, and Zhonghua Middle School, have jointly petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese directors, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and Xi Yushu, requesting an increase in the amount of subsidies for Chinese schools. The original text is as follows:

Respectfully submitted: Since the national crisis, Shanghai's environment has been unique, and the cost of all goods has soared, making life increasingly difficult. Our schools' funding largely relies on tuition fees. Currently, all school expenses are several times higher than before the war, while the average increase in tuition fees is less than 30%, which is far from commensurate with the rise in prices. The Shanghai Municipal Council's tax revenue has increased significantly each month this year, and various expenditures have also increased proportionally by more than 150%. The total amount of our Chinese education subsidies for this year should be included in the Shanghai Municipal Council's budget increase. However, our schools urgently need a large amount of subsidies, even more so than in the past, which we believe you are well aware of. We have always admired your enthusiasm for education and your benevolent nature, and we believe you will do your utmost to protect the welfare of our compatriots in the concession, which is deeply admired by all. We earnestly request that you uphold justice and, based on the increase in other expenditures, vigorously advocate to the Shanghai Municipal Council's board of directors for a broad increase in the amount of subsidies for Chinese schools, in order to meet the needs of the public and stabilize education. We rely on your wisdom and earnestly request your consideration.

### Mr. Zhu Xiaoqin, Proprietor of the Jialin Student Loan Fund, Narrates (3)

Managers in the same industry often concurrently serve in foreign firms, not only to increase their personal income, but also to facilitate business operations. I successively served as a runner for foreign firms such as Shun Heng, Gonghe, and Baosheng. Whenever disputes arose, I always tried to mediate between the two parties, hoping to achieve a fair outcome. However, the parties involved often tended towards extremes, greatly differing from my intentions. Therefore, I resigned from those positions shortly after.

In 1925, I suddenly suffered a great misfortune. After I completed the funeral arrangements for my late father, I also dug an artesian well in the west side of the Miaogong Temple in Haining City, several tens of zhang deep and several bao in circumference, named the Lüqin Public Well, as per my late father's will. At the same time, I also dug a Shuangjie well in Xiashi Town, which belongs to the county, to commemorate my late paternal aunt's return to the Han family as a chaste woman, and the virtuous conduct of her successor wife, also as per my late father's will. My late father was a straightforward and righteous person, who lived to the age of seventy-four.

I managed Datongyuan for several years, increasing capital and expanding operations, which flourished daily. By 1930, the foundation was deep and the reputation was well-established. However, things unexpectedly took a turn for the worse. Misfortune arose from within, resulting in considerable losses. Coupled with the January 28th Incident, the situation deteriorated day by day. I quickly took measures to wind down the business, closing it down after five years. This was done for the sake of others and for myself, as I did not want the situation to become unmanageable.

In the summer of 1936, I established a student loan fund in Haining, using the name of my deceased son, Jialin, to provide loans to those in the county who could not afford to attend high school or university, since our county only had junior high schools and had suffered consecutive droughts, leading to rural bankruptcy. Those who received loans could cover their tuition, board, and lodging expenses at schools in Shanghai and Hangzhou, calculated from the time they enrolled until graduation, spanning several years. Although the number of recipients was not large, it was still a contribution, like a small grain of rice in a large pile. In the following year, on August 13th, although I suffered losses, this matter was still continued in Shanghai, without restrictions on origin, and the loan amount was reduced to tuition fees only. Up to now, there have been seven sessions.

My wife gave birth to one son and six daughters. The second and third sons, as well as the eldest daughter, all died young. The eldest son was Jialin, who passed away in April 1932. The second daughter, Jiazhen, is currently studying at a university. The others, Bao, Zhu, Yu, and Cui, are all in primary and secondary schools. After 1932, my concubine gave birth to two sons named Jiapeng and Jiaqiong, and a daughter named Jiafeng. I was taught by my late father to always plan thoroughly and devote all my efforts to helping others. However, the suspicion of overstepping boundaries is unavoidable, and I often face criticism. It is not that I am unaware of the importance of humility and reticence, but when righteousness is at stake, I dare not yield. My father was fond of acting as Cao Qiu for others. Over the past thirty years, he has introduced countless relatives and friends, but less than one-third have become self-reliant, and more than two-thirds have given up on themselves. Those who have succeeded are even fewer. From this, I know that the path of life is rugged, and it is frightening to stumble. Whenever I encounter young people with potential, I always offer earnest advice, without catering to personal feelings or using deceptive language. Some may resent or hate me for it, but I do not care. I value virtue first and talent second. I often compare talent to a knife and virtue to a handle. If someone has great talent but lacks virtue, then they are like a knife without a handle, sharp but unusable. I advise people to prioritize diligence and thrift, and then other things. I often compare thrift to the root, and other things to branches and leaves. Those with ambitions to conquer the world and the courage of ten thousand men, but who do not start with diligence and thrift, are often like flowers in a vase, with thousands of blossoms but not a single fruit. I have observed this for decades, and it has never failed. My way of observing and advising people is also what I use to encourage myself in ordinary times.

Now I am fifty years old, and I have experienced many changes. My ambitions have faded, and my life is drifting, growing old indifferently. What I cannot stop thinking about is that my two sons are still young. Looking ahead, I may not be able to fully educate and nurture them. Therefore, I rely on all of you. If you can remember my feelings today, guide and support them, and give them assistance, so that I do not make this earnest appeal in vain, it would truly be a blessing for them. (The End)

### The Old Master Has Money

— Xu Yu

The Old Master said: "Money is the vanguard!"

If a person has a "vanguard," then no matter how rugged the world is or how terrible society is, everything will eventually turn out well. Even if you cause some trouble, it will definitely be resolved.

For example, our Old Master has roamed the world his entire life. Relying on his magical skills, the "vanguard" that has come under his command is more than tens of millions? Relying on his "proper allocation," he has been advancing all the way, unstoppable. Some say he is a "lucky general" on the battlefield of life. I think that is the most appropriate description.

That year, the Old Master was happy for a moment and had a relationship with a certain dancer. Who knew that this bitch was ignorant and actually wanted to be his wife. So the Old Master gave a shout, and the "vanguard" immediately rushed over. In a moment, the storm calmed down. The Old Master triumphantly returned in victory!

Since the Old Master possesses this "extraordinary talent," the things he does are naturally incomparable to ordinary people. For example, making money - the most important thing in life - ordinary people cannot even approach him slightly. He only needs one phone call, and colorful banknotes will jump in for ten thousand! Compared to simpletons like you and me, burying our heads and sweating all day, we probably wouldn't even have that amount in a lifetime.

"When money is gone, it will come again," this is a line from Li Bai's poem, which is also the "philosophy" that the Old Master trusts most. He often says: "I really can't understand what's the use of ordinary fools saving money? When a person dies, everything is over. Besides, making money is quite easy!" So when it comes to his "sacrificial" spirit, it is really quite astonishing. And that is why the Old Master can become a "lucky general."

As long as he can earn the "vanguard," then there is no need to worry about allocating the "vanguard." As a result, things will "turn bad luck into good fortune," and life can be lived in the "most interesting" way - at least that's how the Old Master often thinks.

Over the decades, his experiences have proven that his vision has not been shaken. So now the Old Master is even more generous in allocating the "vanguard" and even more committed to his "most reasonable" "belief." (Moreover, things are not like before now. Recruiting the vanguard is even "easier" now!)

The Old Master is also quite well-versed in psychology. He believes that all fools must love money, and the world is full of fools! He also believes that all those who love money must not have money; and those who do not have money are the most likely to become defeated generals in his "vanguard."

Therefore, the Old Master looks down on poor people as soon as he sees them. As soon as he looks down on them, he often thinks: "The Old Master has money! Humph, what are you?" So he walks with a swaying gait.

Swaying and swaying, the Old Master swayed past the corner of ×× Road when suddenly a young beggar came up to him:

"Old Master, bless you, I'm hungry..."

A smelly and ugly thing! The Old Master raised his foot and gave a fierce kick. Haha, the young beggar somersaulted.

Things got awkward. A burly man in the corner rushed up, extremely aggressively, "That's my child, how dare you—"

Saying that, he stretched out his fist: big and thick!

Seeing the situation was not good, the Old Master immediately reached into his pocket, thinking that if the "vanguard" came out, wouldn't that be enough to make them retreat? He hung a sentence "The Old Master has money" on his lips...

But unexpectedly, the other party's fist had already landed, cleanly hitting the Old Master's left cheek, "Who cares about your stinky money!"

The Old Master also did a somersault...

Looking at the wallet full of banknotes, the Old Master felt a little empty after all.

Who knew that there would be such a "cheap scum" in the world who doesn't love money!

(2) Boat Filled with Water

A certain shipping company has recently experienced slow business and has no goods to transport. However, the ships still sail to foreign countries as usual. Because there are no goods, the weight of the ships is reduced, causing them to rock erratically. Therefore, they have no choice but to fill the ships with water.

Some say: This is a strange thing!

### Looking for a "Guarantor"

— Yi Ren

With great difficulty, searching east and west, and expending a great deal of effort, I found a position as a small clerk in a transportation company. However, I needed a "reliable business guarantor!" For me, a poor kid with no rich relatives or noble friends, this was truly the most difficult problem. But for the sake of eating, I had to thicken my skin, muster my courage, and try my luck.

The first person I visited was the principal of my old school. After explaining my intentions, he beat around the bush, saying how bad the situation was in Shanghai, how difficult it was for him to be the principal, and therefore he said he had long rejected all guarantees and social interactions. He seemed to sense my disappointed attitude, and repeatedly said that he sympathized with me, but said that he had no way to help.

The second person I visited was a distant uncle, who was very wealthy and had a considerable position in Shanghai's business community. But when I went, he said that he had already published a notice stating that he would not act as a guarantor for anyone, so he felt that he was also unable to help.

I ran around for an entire day, bringing back only fatigue and disappointment.

The next day, with a weary step, I went to find another fellow villager. He was a wealthy "resident alien," who was quite active before the war, and currently lived a very comfortable life. After he knew my intention, he slowly narrated a story: how he had guaranteed someone to work in the ×× bank, how that person "messed things up," and how he had to pay compensation, so he declined to be a guarantor. No matter how I explained that my position was not as an accountant or cashier, but only a general affairs clerk, he always refused with "I'm sorry."

Walking out of this gentleman's door, I was truly filled with extreme resentment. So I went to visit a classmate who had graduated with me and was working at the ×× bookstore. My purpose was to chat and relieve my worries, not to ask him to be a guarantor, because I knew that he did not have the qualifications to be a "guarantor," he was just a small clerk. But after he knew about my situation, he insisted on being my guarantor, and told me to try.

I anxiously held the classmate's guarantee and went to see the company's manager. Unexpectedly, he actually approved my guarantor. So I started working.

"Nothing in the world is as difficult as eating," I couldn't help but softly recite as I sat at my desk and started working.

(5) The Boundary between Love and Desire

When he saw Luo Xiangqi, he only talked for a dozen minutes, and he felt that this was exactly the woman who completely matched his intentions. After returning to the Tianjin Hotel that day, he didn't sleep for a whole night, constantly thinking about her. But her image in his mind was too vague, and he could never imagine a clear outline. It was as if she was right in front of him, but also as if she was thousands of miles away, just like when people close their eyes, intending to imagine the face of a closest relative at home, but all they get are many vague, fragmented impressions.

"Is her face long or round?" He lay on the couch, staring blankly at a bright electric light. He couldn't even remember clearly whether Luo Xiangqi's face was long or round!

When he was thinking about her, Zhao Yukun's injury to Shen Mazi and the harassment of those hooligans had almost completely disappeared from his mind. Only one thing he could never forget was Luo Xiangqi's current status.

"She is the third master's concubine, and I have received some favors from the first master. Moreover, there is the relationship with Jiu Wen mixed in. How can I think about her?" He tried his best to restrain himself in a very excited state of insomnia.

But what's the use? When love reaches the point where it really wants to be expressed, its power will never be more moderate than a volcano about to erupt! The next afternoon, Begonia met Luo Xiangqi again in the reception room of Yuan's mansion.

"How do you feel about the life of singing opera?" Xiangqi used very brief words to tell Begonia that Governor Hu had agreed to help him, and then asked with an indifferent expression.

Begonia raised his head and smiled at a photo of Yuan the Garrison Commissioner hanging on the wall.

"Completely like a puppet!" The reply was very crisp.

Luo Xiangqi's gaze circled around Begonia's collar again, feeling even more surprised in her heart. Why can't I find any trace of the air of a singer in this young man? (52)

### Commemoration

— Jue Hui

Commemoration is not just commemoration, commemoration must be found outside of commemoration!

For example: Today is the sixteenth anniversary of the death of the Premier, and there must be so many people to commemorate him.

Violation of conscience, satisfying selfish desires, forcing the poor to "have no way into the earth and no way to heaven," so they sit high on piles of rice to commemorate the Premier... Truly "alas, how sad!"

The Premier's death is sad; but the Premier's spirit is immortal, his heart is immortal, so it is worthy of all those who are worthy of the Premier to commemorate him.

The "death of a person's heart" is already the "greatest sadness"; if the heart is "alive" but does all kinds of evil, then it is even "greater sadness"!

Those with a "dead heart" are certainly not worthy of commemorating the Premier; those with a "living heart" who do all kinds of evil are even less worthy!

Commemoration is not just commemoration, commemoration must be found outside of commemoration. What is outside of commemoration? It is conscience!

### The Mysterious James Stewart

— Zhao Ji

Among Hollywood male stars, the one with the best relationships is this James Stewart, who is still a bit of a kid. Because whether it is male stars who are willing to be friends with him, many female stars also want to get close to him. Even temperamental people like Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich have a considerable liking for him.

It's really strange. Counting his age, he is already over thirty, but when he sees strangers, he will act coy and show that he is very afraid of being embarrassed. Even the other party is often made uneasy by this appearance of his. Some say that the shyest Hollywood star is Gary Cooper, but Gary can still deal with a long string of polite remarks, pretending to be a very polite attitude. Our Stewart doesn't even know these kinds of social skills.

James Stewart is not only often like this in reality, but the roles he plays on the screen are also in this tone. Anyone who has seen "You Can't Take It With You" and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" will definitely laugh at his honest and shy expression. Not only does his expression give movie fans a very deep impression, but in all of Hollywood's male stars, he is probably the only one who can do this kind of acting.

But the Hollywood female stars, who are willing to act with him, are willing to co-star with him. In fact, he is not the most handsome leading man, but he has a kind of inexplicable mystery. He is not an absolutely talented actor who can act, but he is not pretentious, his emotions are natural, he never puts on airs, and he can portray the personality of an honest and coy young man. People in Hollywood often shout: "Strange, why do women like to be friends with Jamie and co-star with him? Strange!"

The real reason is something that no one can figure out or say, but James is still a bachelor to this day.

Because everyone in Hollywood likes to co-star with him, stars such as Margaret Sullavan, Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow, Sonja Henie, Carole Lombard, Katharine Hepburn, Ruth Hussey, and Rosalind Russell have all worked with him; however, it is not the female lead who is noticed, but Stewart's mysterious style and typical acting skills that overwhelm the female stars who co-star with him! In the movie city, women both love him and hate him!

Last year, he co-starred with Katharine Hepburn, who made a comeback and returned to the screen, in "The Philadelphia Story," and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for the first time because of his excellent acting skills. The film has already arrived in Shanghai, and the test screenings have taken place. The cast is very strong, with Cary Grant, John Howard, Ruth Hussey, Virginia Weidler, etc. co-starring; the director is the famous director George Cukor of "Dinner at Eight" and "The Women."

Chapter Two: Brave Heroes of the Northern Frontier Show Their Skills

Zhang Cangqiu chuckled and said, "Don't just rely on your own efforts. The times create heroes, and heroes create the times. When the Yuan Dynasty was overthrown, my Taizong rose up with the times, and heroes followed him like shadows. He was just a little monk in the Huangjue Temple, yet he was able to pacify the world. The sea can be measured by the peck, but how can one predict a person's future?" Xu Jing was silent, hearing Zhang Cangqiu speaking with such great ambition. Zhang Cangqiu was also somewhat drunk, so he asked for rice. Liu San brought the rice. Zhang Cangqiu ate three large bowls, saying, "It's been a long time since I've had rice. Today, you've treated me like a guest of honor." Then the meal ended. After washing their faces, the two men sat in the study. Zhang Cangqiu originally wanted to hurry on his way, but somehow, meeting Xu Jing today, they felt a mutual appreciation and hit it off very well. Xu Jing also found that Zhang Cangqiu seemed like a rough martial man at first sight, but his words were very bold and insightful, like a hero in the world, so he treated him with utmost hospitality. The two men talked and talked, and before they knew it, the sun was setting in the west, gradually disappearing behind the mountains. Zhang Cangqiu said, "Oh dear, I've talked too much and forgotten the time. I wonder if there's a place to stay ahead? I want to hurry to Yushan." Xu Jing said, "It's rare for us to meet. Since you're here, make yourself at home. Don't mind the humble rooms and narrow windows. Please stay here for a day or two before continuing your journey, how about it?" Zhang Cangqiu said, "Thank you for your invitation. I'll stay at your residence tonight and leave tomorrow. Just don't worry too much about me. Just have wine for me to drink, but there's no need to prepare dishes." Xu Jing said, "Good, my house has plenty of wine, enough for you to drink." Zhang Cangqiu then went outside the door to lead in that famous black horse, tying it inside the fence. He smiled at Xu Jing and said, "This steed of mine is very valuable. I need its strength to hurry to Shanhaiguan, so don't let bad people get any ideas." Xu Jing said, "Although the situation outside is unstable now, there are still no robberies or thefts in this area, but it's hard to say in the future." Then he instructed Liu San to prepare some feed for the horse. The two men sat in the courtyard, discussing martial arts. (5)

### A View of Life Through Struggle

— Zong Yu

Relaxation and tension, the way of both literary and martial arts. Spiritual relaxation and tension are not about seeking momentary peace or the numbness of nerves for a short time, but about regulating the spirit, accelerating the production of new spirit, so as to continue to struggle forward with renewed vigor, thereby extending the time of struggle to infinity.

### My Views on Reforming Kunqu Opera

— Song Ruiyang

The Problem of Popularization We cannot deny that Kunqu opera is too aristocratic and too elegant. Not only are the lyrics in the form of classical literature, but many of the dialogues are also in paired, rhyming four-six style, making it incomprehensible to listeners. In addition, there is a large amount of Suzhou dialect, which people from other provinces simply cannot understand. Therefore, I propose: First, since Kunqu opera is the embodiment of pure literature, the lyrics should not be changed—and they are matched with special melodies, so it is impossible to change them. Taking a step back, even if they were made popular, it would no longer be "Kunqu opera"—the only remedy is for the theater owner to print the lyrics and give them to the audience, or sell them to the audience at the lowest possible price, so that they can read the words while listening to the music, which would make it very easy to understand. Second, all dialogues in the four-six style must be changed to colloquial new spoken language, so that people can understand it at a glance. Furthermore, I hope that all dialogues will be changed to speak the national language. At the same time, Kunqu opera is a theatrical troupe that is most conducive to contraction, it can be performed on a large stage that can accommodate thousands of spectators, or it can appear on a small red carpet in a small living room, for the pure enjoyment of a very small number of people, and it has the greatest mobility, as long as a small number of actors, with a very small number of "props" and musical instruments, can "go on business". Therefore, I propose to organize many traveling troupes, performing in various parts of the homeland, so that the opportunity to be close to the public is increased, it will be more easily accepted by the public, and a part of the propaganda work and edification work can also be shared by them.

### Costumes and Facial Makeup

Kunqu opera is a song and dance drama, so its robes, sleeves, belts, boots, etc. are all stylized and typical, suitable for viewing, and helpful for dancing; and it is a performance of ancient events, so it is not appropriate to completely abolish the inherent costumes, but many unreasonable aspects should be modified. As for facial makeup, Mr. Zheng Zhenduo denounced it as a "reappearance of barbarism." I personally do not advocate that old opera facial makeup is a kind of extraordinary art, but under certain conditions, I also believe that some of it can be used to symbolize the personality of the characters in the play, such as using a white face for a villain, and a red-browed oily face to represent a thug, which I think can be retained. As for applying terrible, grotesque colors on the face, creating red, black, gold, and other faces that are neither human nor monster, I dare not accept it. Therefore, I think it is enough to use a little white powder, black ink, and rouge, to match the ancient saying of "powder and ink on stage." (To be continued tomorrow)
