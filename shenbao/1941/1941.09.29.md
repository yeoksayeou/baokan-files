### Chinese Army Blocks Japanese Advance; Fierce Battle Unfolds Outside Changsha; Chinese Interception of Japanese Rear and Flanks Proves Quite Successful; Japanese Plainclothes Units Infiltrating China Are All Eliminated

Chongqing - A Chinese military spokesman announced at 10:00 AM today that the Chinese army is still holding Changsha tonight and is facing a fierce attack by the Japanese 6th Division. A bloody battle is underway outside Changsha. The spokesman also said that at 7:00 PM this afternoon, he had spoken with military officials in Changsha, confirming that the Chinese army is engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army, which is attacking with bloodshed. It is reported that the Japanese forces participating in the war are the 3rd, 6th, 13th, 14th, 40th, and 44th Divisions. The spokesman added that the Japanese army launched a terrible human sacrifice in the afternoon but still failed to make any progress. The war is currently taking place three to five miles from the city. It is said that the Japanese Fifth Column (plainclothes soldiers) has been discovered in Changsha, but it is not certain whether the Japanese have used paratroopers. At the same time, it is reported that Chinese bomber squadrons successfully attacked the Japanese army in the afternoon. The entire Chinese army in the north is conducting flanking attacks, which are said to be very successful. As a result, Japanese reinforcements have not been able to leave Yuezhou and Hankou. Meanwhile, Chongqing is very concerned about the fate of Changsha. This is the third time since the war began that Changsha has been seriously threatened. (United Press dispatch from the 28th)

Chongqing - Military News: (1) Changsha, 8:00 PM on the 28th, reports that on the evening of the 27th, several hundred Japanese plainclothes soldiers infiltrated the Chinese front line and launched a sneak attack on the northeastern suburbs of Changsha. They were all eliminated by the Chinese army this morning, and order in the city is as usual. (2) Changsha, 8:00 PM on the 28th, reports that as of the time of the dispatch, the Chinese front line is still in the area north of the Lao Dao River, Shizipu, and Huanghua City, resisting strongly, and the Japanese army has made no progress. Apart from some Japanese bombing of Chinese positions today, the situation is relatively calm. (Dispatch from the 28th)

Chongqing

Military News: (1) The battle on the entire Xiangbei front has continued fiercely on the original battlefield from the evening of the 27th to noon on the 28th. Under the cover of Japanese aircraft bombing, repeated fierce attacks were all blocked by the Chinese army's strenuous defense, preventing the Japanese from advancing. Subsequently, several small groups were organized, attempting to take advantage of the opportunity to bypass the Chinese flanks, but were all ambushed and killed. The entire front is still a bloody and fierce battle. (Dispatch from the 28th)

Chongqing - Fierce fighting continues on the Xiangbei front. Chinese sources say that they are currently strongly resisting the Japanese advance to the south. The main force of the Chinese army's column is putting pressure on the Japanese flanks and rear. The Chinese army has recovered several military transportation centers in the Japanese rear, including several important ferry crossings at Miwei and Xinqiang River, and the important Tingziqiao station on the Yuehan Road north of Yuezhou. Judging from the current situation, the Chinese seem to be paying great attention to activities in the Japanese rear and flanks, hoping to use this attack to stop the Japanese advance. According to Chinese military experts, Changsha lacks natural defenses, and the Chinese air force, heavy artillery, and mechanized equipment are relatively inferior. Therefore, in addition to putting pressure on the Japanese rear and flanks to cut off their supplies and reinforcements, there is no way to stop the Japanese frontal attack. At present, the Chinese do not attach much importance to the Japanese offensive from Guangzhou, believing that its purpose is only to divert Chinese attention. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

Chongqing - General Xue Yue, the Chinese commander defending Changsha, recently telegraphed from the Changsha military. The Chinese high command here denies that the Japanese have occupied Changsha. This phone call from General Xue was made at 10:30 AM today. However, General Xue admitted that the situation is very tight because the Japanese army is only five kilometers from Changsha. Xue declared that Chinese soldiers have decided to defend Changsha street by street and alley by alley. An official military spokesman declined to comment on the situation, but repeatedly stated that the Chinese army is determined to continue to fight the Japanese army with all its strength. (United Press dispatch from the 28th)

Chongqing - Military News: On the tenth day of the Battle of Changsha, the Chinese army stepped up surprise attacks on Japanese strongholds in the rear, recovering strongholds such as Wugou, Changle Street, and Xinshi on the Miluo River, and attacking Japanese warships south of the Miluo River. This Chinese army crossed the north bank of the Miluo River and defeated several Japanese regiments in Gaoqiao, causing "mountains of casualties" and creating a huge overall advantage after the great victory in Taierzhuang in May 1938. At the same time, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army in the central section of the Hunan-Hubei border, attempting to relieve the pressure on Changsha. The Chinese military authorities admitted that the situation in Changsha is difficult, saying that the Japanese offensive is more fierce than before, and said that the Japanese claim that they broke through Changsha on Saturday afternoon and that the Chinese army suffered more than 10,000 casualties is absurd. It also stated that the Chinese army won a victory in Jinjing, 45 miles northeast of Changsha, with extremely heavy casualties on both sides. The military spokesman also strongly proved the absurdity of the claim that Changsha had fallen. According to what he told reporters, he spoke to the Changsha command by phone three hours after the Japanese announced that they had entered Changsha, which shows that the claim that Changsha had fallen is absurd. (United Press dispatch from the 28th)

Chongqing - The Chinese army on both sides of the Miluo River has launched a counterattack, recovering Changle Street, Wukou, and Xinshi, cutting off Japanese transportation and expanding the results of the battle. The main force of the Japanese army is still blocked on the line of Shizipu, Baishui, and Fulinpu, suffering heavy casualties. Last night, a group of Japanese troops reached the northeastern suburbs of Changsha and were surrounded by the Chinese army. The retreat of this group of Japanese troops has now been cut off by the Chinese army, and they are only relying on aircraft to drop supplies. Their combat effectiveness is not strong. Taro Toyoshima, the commander of the Japanese 3rd Division, committed suicide after being wounded in Changle Street. (Dispatch from the 28th)

Chongqing - Military News: (1) The Battle of Xiangbei, from the evening of the 26th to the evening of the 27th, the frontal bloody battle has not stopped. The Japanese troops who launched fierce attacks southward from Liqiao, Fulinpu, and Gaoqiao were all strongly blocked by the Chinese army in the area north of Shedao River and Shizipu, and near Chunhua Mountain. The Japanese troops in Shizipu suffered heavy casualties and their momentum has been thwarted. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to launch a fierce counterattack and is currently engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The fighting in the area near Chunhua Mountain is also extremely fierce. The Chinese army behind the Japanese army has occupied important river crossing points along the Miluo River, such as Wukou, Changle Street, and Xinshi. The troops on the south bank of the Miluo River have reached areas such as Shawan Datangpu, and near the Sandeqiao Baishui Station. All Chinese troops along the Xinqiang River have also made expected progress. (2) On the Xiangbei front, on the 26th, the entire line was engaged in bloody hand-to-hand combat all day. The Japanese troops concentrated their full strength and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army, but were suppressed by the Chinese army's crisscrossing firepower and failed to succeed. In the battlefields around Sandeqiao, Liqiao, Fulinpu, and Gaoqiao, the Japanese army suffered many casualties, the soil was red, and the fierce fighting continued without end. (3) On the 26th, a part of the Japanese army advanced into the southwestern area of Gaoqiao and was surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army. By evening, the Japanese army had been completely wiped out. (4) The Chinese army on the Hunan-Hubei border operated behind the Japanese army and achieved great results. On the evening of the 24th, it recovered Tingziqiao, cutting off the main supply line of the Japanese army and annihilating many Japanese troops. It is now actively expanding the results of the battle. (Dispatch from the 27th)

London - The British Colonial Office said that according to a report from Dr. Kendall of the Hong Kong Health Bureau, a ship carrying lepers from Hong Kong to the Chinese interior was attacked by Japanese patrol ships with machine guns en route, but no one was injured. Japanese officers then boarded the British ship escorting the ship and shot a British officer in the head with a rifle, but he was not seriously injured. The Japanese officers ordered the British crew to board Japanese boats, and inspected the other ships. Upon learning that they were carrying lepers, they apologized and left. Before long the waves began to churn, and the ship temporarily stopped. Unexpectedly, people boarded the ship again to inspect it. However, those who boarded the ship were pirates. Seeing that they were foreigners and held certificates issued by the Chinese military authorities, they did not disturb them and left. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

Editorial

### Re-examination of Japan's Alliance with the Three Powers

The signing of the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan reached its first anniversary the day before yesterday. I remember the situation at this time last year, Germany and Italy were complacent, and Japan was full of arrogance, as if victory was just around the corner, and the desire to divide the world could be realized immediately. Especially Japan, which had long felt isolated in diplomacy, suddenly gained two allied countries. In their elation, even Konoe and Matsuoka expressed that they would prepare to "show" the military power of the three allied countries when necessary, and Nakano Seigo and other active elements even more clamored to divide up territories. However, with only a year's difference, the situation has changed. The exchange of telegrams between Berlin and Rome was just a lonely self-entertainment. Although Tokyo has issued slogans that have not been heard for a long time, such as strengthening the Axis powers, it cannot completely conceal the disappointment in their mood. It can be seen that those who are accustomed to tearing up treaties cannot obtain real benefits from the means of concluding treaties. The Three-Power Alliance is indeed fortunate enough to be the continuation of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. As for the actual value of the alliance, there are already many significant facts in this year that can prove it.

Since the Meiji Restoration in Japan, in the past eighty years, its external operations have undeniably achieved great gains. However, it has been eager for quick success and quick profits, with a narrow and shallow vision, and often blinded by emotions and prejudices. In a smooth environment, it can still cope with it easily. Once the international situation is unfavorable, it inevitably makes mistakes. The Washington Conference after the last European war was the first time that Japan suffered international pressure after the Restoration. Thanks to the fact that it was the golden age of constitutionalism at that time, and the authorities were able to maintain a prudent attitude, they were able to live in peace for nearly ten years. After the "September 18th" Incident, Japan was hijacked by extremists internally, and indulged by one or two major powers externally. At the same time, there were totalitarian countries advocating changing the current situation and overthrowing the Treaty of Versailles. Japan's great desires broke out and could no longer be restrained, and its foreign policy embarked on a path of speculation and adventure, starting with the signing of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact in the winter of 1936. At that time, Japanese public opinion generally believed that it was not advisable to form alliances with unreliable countries far away, provoke the anger of powerful neighbors (referring to the Soviet Union), and make the democratic powers look at them with disdain. Therefore, the German demand for a military alliance based on the Anti-Comintern Pact was repeatedly delayed, and no result was achieved even after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War and the collapse of the Hiranuma Cabinet. If it had not been for the Nazi victory last summer and the crisis in Britain, perhaps the Three-Power Alliance would still be difficult to produce. Japan gladly formed an alliance at the moment when the Nazis were in high demand, although it was one step behind Italy, which participated in the war when the German-French war was about to be settled, but they both had speculative qualities and were focused on how to get a share of the pie after Germany's victory. On the German side, as a Western reporter pointed out at that time: A company never wants to easily accept new shares when it is booming and making profits. The reason why the Nazis at that time eagerly sought to unite with Japan was nothing but to see their own difficulties early and the need to rely on Japanese power. Therefore, the Three-Power Alliance itself was from the beginning a nature of mutual deception and utilization. The actual value of the alliance must be re-evaluated at any time due to the evolution of the international situation. It is not entirely unexpected that it cannot be trusted and effective.

On the Japanese side, there was the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact this spring, and recently there was the launch of negotiations with the United States. No matter how the Japanese authorities explain it, this is always contrary to the fundamental spirit of the Three-Power Alliance. In fact, even at the same time as the alliance was established, the Japanese authorities stated that they would not abandon the adjustment of relations with the United States because of this. The other day, Ito, the director of the Japanese government's Information Bureau, gave a speech, extravagantly talking about Japan's contributions after the signing of the alliance, and cited Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute and the advance into southern Vietnam as examples. In fact, those were only to satisfy Japan's own desires, and had nothing to do with the Three-Power Alliance, and were definitely not the inner demands of Germany when the alliance was formed. As for the German admiration for the Japanese Navy, hoping that Japan could exert its practical effect of containing Britain and the United States, Japan can only put it in the second place at most to consider. Only how to solve its own difficulties is the urgent task today. Try to see that recently, the US-Japan talks have been endless, but the statements and speeches issued by the Japanese government and its spokespersons commemorating the anniversary of the alliance still avoid directly stimulating Britain and the United States? Therefore, if the Japanese really had great expectations for the signing of the alliance at this time last year, this expectation has been diluted with the passage of time, regardless of what its allies think about this.

However, Japan's indifference to the Three-Power Alliance is one thing, and it will still use this to value itself and use it as a tool to deal with the democratic countries is another thing, which cannot be confused. It's just that no matter how the Japanese government and the public repeatedly clarify that the Three-Power Alliance is the focus of foreign policy, the real focus is on how to achieve its goals and solve the current difficulties. The alliance is just a means, and it is not the only means. If satisfactory concessions can be obtained from the democratic countries, then what was once revered as sacred may not be discarded like worn shoes. However, since such concessions cannot be obtained, the call to support the Axis powers will revive after being silent. When the Japanese side is currently making every effort to show a conciliatory attitude towards the United States, the remaining appeasement policy in the international community was once happy, thinking that it may not be difficult to prevent Japan from leaving the Axis powers. But when Tokyo made it clear that it would not change the Three-Power Alliance as the basis of its policy, these people were worried again, feeling that US-Japan relations could not be improved. In fact, the overall situation in the Far East and Japan's policy have never changed. What has changed are just the illusions in the minds of those who pursue the appeasement policy. What can fundamentally eliminate an alliance is not negotiation or the concession of exchanged conditions, but the decisive victory of the war in the three major battlefields of China, the Soviet Union, and the Atlantic Ocean, and the firm and powerful action of the anti-aggression united front in the Pacific. To this day, the Three-Power Alliance itself has actually become the end of its rope, and there is no need to overemphasize it.

### British Government Re-examines Far East and Near East Policies; Ensuring Transportation Lines Is an Urgent Task; Aid to China and the Soviet Union Are Equally Important

Reuters, London, 28th - The British policy in the Near East, Middle East, and Far East is currently under review by the government. The Sunday Times diplomatic correspondent claimed that the transportation of supplies to the British army, the Soviet Union, and China occupies an important position in the current cabinet research. The primary responsibility of General Wavell, the commander-in-chief of the British army in India, is to ensure the transportation lines to the Soviet Union through Iran and the entrances of these transportation lines in Iraq and elsewhere. The War Cabinet attaches great importance to the responsibility we bear to deliver supplies to their destination. If the current transportation lines through Iran to the Soviet Union are insufficient, then what about the lifelines to China? American experts are currently assisting to maintain the smooth flow of the Burma Road, but the maximum freight capacity of the road is 40,000 tons per month, while the previous Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was 75,000 tons. A large number of goods are currently piled up in Yangon waiting to be transported, and methods must be found to transport them out to accommodate the new goods that continue to arrive. Several plans to build new transportation lines between China, Burma, and India have been accepted in principle by the British government. These new transportation lines include railways to supplement the Burma Road, roads starting from India, and air transportation lines.

### British and American Experts Sent to China to Seek Closer Economic Cooperation

United Press, Washington, 28th - The US Treasury Department said yesterday that Kirkland, a foreign service officer under the department, will leave for Hong Kong on Sunday. According to reliable sources, he will participate in an economic conference related to stabilizing China's legal tender. Kirkland will leave San Francisco by Clipper today. It is said that Sir Niemeyer, the governor of the Bank of England, will participate in the meeting. (According to London's announcement yesterday, Sir Niemeyer's mission to Chongqing is of a financial nature). The Treasury Department also said that Kirkland will cooperate with other Chinese, British, and American officials to deal with "financial and economic issues related to the equalization fund, as well as discussions on China's foreign exchange controls and US freezing orders."

Havas, Chongqing, 28th - The Central Daily News commented on the British dispatch of a financial and economic delegation to China, saying that Britain is now fighting for the same cause as China and has entered the same fate. The opening of the Burma Road and all kinds of facts are enough to prove that Britain recognizes the above two points. Now, it has sent a financial and economic delegation to China, led by Sir Niemeyer, the chairman of the Bank of England, and assisted by financial and economic experts from the United States and Britain. This delegation will not only help to strengthen China's financial and economic strength, but also enable close cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States in finance and economy. It will also be of great benefit to the cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States in finance and economy when the world peace line is established after the war. Any step to increase China's strength in the struggle is to increase the strength of the democratic camp and the countries that are currently resisting aggression. Britain is an important part of these countries, so increasing China's strength in the struggle is tantamount to increasing Britain's own strength in the war. This is the same meaning as the Chinese people's hope that the strength of Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries will be enhanced. We are very happy about the coming of the delegation and the selection of the delegation. We will definitely provide all kinds of conveniences and see its success.

United Press, Moscow, 28th: Soviet Foreign Determiner, Rossofsky, stated yesterday that intense fighting had occurred in Crimea for a full day and night. However, he stated, "The battle of Crimea is taking place outside of Crimea," implying a denial of German claims that Nazi forces had advanced to the Perekop Isthmus and the Sea of Azov.

International News Service, Moscow, 28th: The Red Army High Command announced yesterday that four German columns, at a point 220 miles southwest of Moscow, had launched a three-pronged offensive against the Soviet capital, but were repulsed. The Nazi army suffered 20,000 dead and wounded. Soviet public reports stated that the German offensive on the Crimean front was aimed at Sevastopol in the south and the Caucasus in the east, but the offensive was blocked by Soviet fortifications, mines, and air power.

Reuters, London, 28th: A Reuters dispatch from Moscow reported that German forces, with their elite troops aided by Black Shirts, launched a fierce offensive against the Soviet lines south of Lake Ilmen near Staraya Russa, but were ultimately repulsed by the Soviet forces stationed there. Fighting in that area had been quiet for several weeks, but recently resumed, especially intensely in the past few days, but the German army did not succeed. Although they briefly occupied the important town of "L," they were soon driven out by Soviet troops. In two days of fighting, the German side suffered 1,500 casualties. A large battalion of the 30th Division and two companies of the Black Shirts were completely routed. According to recent news, there have been no special changes on the Leningrad front. Soviet troops have achieved local victories in several locations, but the important characteristic is the large number of German war materials lost and the successive deaths of German soldiers. A regiment of Hamburg soldiers and the 20th Infantry Division were defeated in this engagement, and many war materials were captured by Soviet troops.

TASS, Moscow, 28th: On the Northwestern front, the Red Army, led by Klivenko, achieved brilliant results in the past three days, annihilating the 1st Battalion of the 6th Infantry Regiment of the SS Division, the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment, and several companies.

Kyiv Red Army Loses One Million; Soviet Union Denounces German False Propaganda

International News Service, Moscow, 28th: The Soviet High Command today issued a public announcement ridiculing German claims that in the unprecedented battle east of Kyiv, four Soviet armies totaling one million men were annihilated, and that this "victory" was a prelude to the Axis's victory on the Eastern Front. The announcement stated that Marshal Budyonny had rescued most of his troops from east of Kyiv. It is claimed that 800,000 Soviet troops under Marshal Budyonny's command are defending the fortresses of the Transcaucasus oil fields. In mentioning the situation in Odessa and Leningrad, the announcement stated that a large number of Nazi troops besieging the two cities were killed by Soviet defenders. The Soviet Union also absolutely denied that Soviet troops had entered the Crimean Peninsula, stating that "no German troops can set foot on Crimean soil."

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 28th: According to German military sources, the results of the unprecedented battle east of Kyiv were announced today. The number of prisoners captured has reached 665,000, more than double the number captured in the battles of Minsk and Bialystok, and 200,000 more than the number captured in Alsace-Lorraine on June 22 last year. If the number of dead and wounded is added, the Soviet army's losses are more than one million. In addition, 884 tanks and 3,718 artillery pieces were lost. The Soviet Union has now lost its most important military production center. The Soviet victory in the Kyiv area is an important turning point in the war against the Soviet Union.

Authoritative circles do not believe that British troops, including tanks, have been sent to the Caucasus. They refused to discuss possible future battles, only stating that no expeditionary force has been sent. The formation of a joint British-Soviet front in the Caucasus to defend the oil fields is considered one of the most important strategic developments in the future.

### Anti-German Sentiment Rises; Martial Law Declared in Czech Territory; Governors of Bohemia and Moravia Replaced; Attempted Assassination of Puppet Prime Minister Fails

Reuters, London, 28th: According to German news agency reports, former Foreign Minister and current Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, Neurath, has requested to be relieved of his duties due to physical weakness in order to recuperate. Hitler granted his request and instructed Party leader Heydrich to temporarily take his place. Factories in these two provinces that manufacture German military supplies have recently experienced frequent work slowdowns, and Czech people often sabotage railways and other infrastructure. Neurath, wishing to avoid continued conflict between Germans and Czechs, found the situation quite difficult.

International News Service, New York, 28th: The Columbia Broadcasting Company here learned from British broadcasts that Heydrich, after taking office as Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, immediately declared a state of emergency. According to reports, Heydrich has the power to impose the death penalty on anyone who disrupts public order. A British news reporter, commenting on this news, said that Heydrich's appointment to this position is tantamount to admitting that Czech resistance has caused great concern in Berlin.

### Rumors of German Pressure on Bulgaria to Declare War on the Soviet Union; Bulgarian King Meets with Hitler to Discuss Important Issues

Havas, Budapest, 27th: Local newspapers today carried a dispatch from their correspondent in Ankara stating that King Boris of Bulgaria has departed for the Führer's headquarters to meet with Führer Hitler to discuss various important issues.

United Press, Ankara, 28th: Yesterday, reliable diplomatic sources here stated that Germany has demanded that Bulgaria send 100,000 troops to serve on the Soviet front. The German side stated that these troops would not participate in actual combat, but Bulgaria should formally declare war on the Soviet Union. These sources stated that Germany demanded a swift response, while Bulgaria requested room for negotiation on the point of declaring war. Diplomatic circles, in explaining the previous news that Germany had directly sought a separate peace with the Soviet Union, stated that Germany was attempting to probe the Soviet Union, but not actually proposing conditions for mediation. However, diplomatic circles believe that Germany is willing to guarantee that it will remain on the current front lines and will not advance further, including Ukraine and the Caucasus, until the end of the war. At the same time, Germany guarantees not to invade any part of the remaining Soviet territory.

### The Fate of the Entire War Situation Depends on the Eastern Front; Britain and the United States Guarantee Aid to the Soviet Union; The Three-Power Conference Will Be Held Soon in Moscow; Maisky Thanks Britain for Tank Aid to the Soviet Union

Havas, Stockholm, 28th: The Three-Power Conference of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will be held soon in Moscow. According to news from the Moscow Broadcasting Station, Stalin convened a meeting in the Kremlin today with Interior People's Commissar Beria, Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Molotov, and Defense People's Commissar General Timoshenko to discuss the general situation in order to put forward concrete plans at the Three-Power Conference.

United Press, London, 28th: The Moscow radio station reported yesterday that the United States revealed at the Three-Power Conference that the democratic countries have agreed to fully promise the Soviet Union's request for supplies and equipment to continue fighting against Germany. This request includes aircraft, tanks, and various raw materials. The radio station stated that as a result of this agreement, Britain and the United States will jointly transport hundreds of aircraft, hundreds of tanks, and other equipment to the Soviet Union starting immediately. The radio station stated that the democratic countries have stockpiled tens of thousands of tons of raw materials to supply the Soviet war machine. Although the democratic countries themselves lack raw materials, they will still transport valuable items such as aluminum to the Soviet Union. The United States will also transport several types of steel used for military equipment to the Soviet Union. The radio station stated that the democratic countries have assured Moscow that they will supply the Soviet Union with many other items, such as rubber, tungsten, cotton yarn, wool, ramie, and resin.

Reuters, London, 28th: Soviet Ambassador Maisky broadcast here last night to thank the workers for their efforts in the Tank Aid to the Soviet Union Week and expressed the Soviet Union's need for more tanks, saying that the Soviet Union is fighting an unprecedented major battle on the front lines. What will be the result after three months? The entire war situation depends on it. In response to the question of whether the Red Army needs British tanks, he may answer it in simple words: The Soviet Union has indeed developed its tank industry, which was sufficient to meet its own needs when the war had not yet broken out. This can be seen from the quality of the Soviet mechanized units confronting the enemy. But after three months of continuous battles, the situation has changed greatly. On a thousand-mile-long front line, a large number of tanks have been destroyed. Although the Soviet losses are relatively small, they are also significant. How can the usual monthly production compensate for this maximum loss? Moreover, due to Stalin's scorched earth policy, many important military factories have been bombed and destroyed to prevent them from being used by the enemy. Although most of them have been moved to safe areas, it is not possible to choose another factory site and resume work in a short time. Therefore, the production of Soviet tanks has decreased compared to peacetime. The only way to make up for this defect is to ask other freedom-loving countries, especially Britain and the United States, to cooperate. This is why the British and American governments are transferring British tanks to the Soviet army, and why British factories are doing their best to rush to build tanks for the Soviet Union. This kind of method is simple common sense. We must face the facts. Britain and the Soviet Union are now fighting against a very strong enemy country. In this situation, close cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union is the first priority. We must think of this war with a common front, and both sides' resources must be transferred to each other according to the progress and needs of the war situation. All available aid should be transferred to the Eastern Front at present, because a major war unprecedented in human history has been going on in the Eastern Front for more than three months, and the entire war situation will depend on the fate of the Eastern Front. The more tanks Britain can supply to the Soviet Union, the more beneficial it will be to the entire war situation. He hopes that the production standards achieved this week can be maintained and further improved. The slogan today must be "Manufacture tanks, manufacture more tanks, manufacture even more tanks."

### Guo Renyuan Gives Speech in Britain; Post-War Reconstruction in China; Requires British and American Assistance

Reuters, London, 28th: Dr. Guo Renyuan said in a speech to the British Association today on "Post-War Reconstruction in China" that China is destined to become an important country in world politics and may be a great stabilizing factor for international peace or a major threat. It will all depend on how it is reconstructed after the war. China should get full cooperation from Britain and the United States to establish a well-planned economic system, modernize its industry and agriculture to improve the living standards of the people and overseas trade. Britain and the United States should agree to provide full financial and material assistance to China's reconstruction. The new China needs Britain and the United States to fundamentally change their spiritual outlook on China and the Far East. This morning, the British Association's conference on science and post-war relief was chaired by Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to Britain. Gu said in his speech that if the world continues to be dominated by aggressive forces and barbarism, not only will science stop developing, but civilization will also decline and perish due to lack of fertilizer.

### China Will Expose the League of Nations; Poisoning Policy

In the Mengjiang region, opium is grown on a large scale. Taking the five counties of Suiyuan, namely, Sui, Sa, Bao, Tuo, and Qing, as an example, opium is planted on hundreds of thousands of acres, and all are good harvests. The produced raw opium is purchased by the Japanese side, and private trading is strictly prohibited, with violators being sentenced to death. A general investigation office for purchasing opium soil has been set up in Hohhot, with Zhuo Rentuo serving as the director. Management offices have been set up in various county towns. 150 taels are collected per acre of irrigated land and 100 taels are collected per acre of dry land. The price per tael is between 8 jiao and 2 yuan. The collected opium soil is mostly transported to Tianjin and Beijing to manufacture heroin, or sold at high prices to specially set up agencies. After the Ministry of Interior reported, it has telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to forward the League of Nations to expose the matter and urge friendly countries to pay attention.

### Key Points of Chen Lifu's Broadcast Speech

Chongqing: At the invitation of this year's annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Minister of Education Chen Lifu broadcast to Britain at 4 a.m. today, titled "Science and Post-War World Reconstruction." The general idea is that the contribution of science to human civilization is something to be proud of, but it is also a fact that it is misused by a few people for improper purposes to hinder collective security. The misuse of science and its inconsistency with the pace of life have produced all kinds of terrible results, such as: (1) A large number of weapons, which have the danger of destroying mankind; (2) In economics, the creation of a global institution, which is contrary to nationalism; (3) Changes in the population growth rate of the upper and lower classes of society; (4) The constant emergence of novel products, making it difficult for people with slow changes to cope; (5) Creating a serious social problem of unemployment and stimulating the desires of ambitious aggressors, leading to a world war. However, science itself is not guilty, and its rapid progress is not blameworthy. What we should do today is to redefine the goals of science, so that science can be put to proper use, and that the progress of human ethical concepts can keep pace with it, so that mankind can enjoy the benefits of scientific progress without suffering its harm. In his conclusion, Chen proposed convening a world education conference to jointly discuss the perfect principles and methods of integrating science and ethics. (28th Havas dispatch)

### North China Oil Importers; Unwilling to Import Oil

Tianjin: Representatives of oil importers attended a meeting convened by the Japanese in Beijing last Tuesday to discuss the status of the oil industry in northern China. Oil merchants stated that the future is not guaranteed, and that existing oil and funds in the mainland have now been frozen, so they are unwilling to consider importing oil. It is heard that the Japanese intend to assist oil merchants in activating their mainland assets. If this can be done, then Asia and Mobil will jointly import a small amount of oil. It is currently found that Asia alone has gasoline that can supply three-quarters of a month's normal needs, while the American oil companies have sold out their inventories. Therefore, it is now necessary to adopt a oil certificate system as done in Shanghai. These negotiations have attracted the attention of pig bristle exporters, because it is believed that an understanding can facilitate the recovery of pig bristle exports. It is found that there are many pig bristles stored for export, but they cannot be transported out at present. (28th dispatch)

### Dr. Shen Youqian's Lecture: "Training of Thought"

Explanation of the Importance of Adapting to Circumstances in Thinking.  The city's Academic Lecture series held its eleventh lecture yesterday, inviting Dr. Shen Youqian, Deputy Director of the Chinese Education Department of the Municipal Council, to speak on the topic of "Training of Thought."  Dr. Shen has a wealth of insights into educational psychology, and many people who admired him came to listen, filling the seats.  The following is an excerpt of the speech taken by a reporter from the Da Hua News Agency, summarizing the main points:

1. Thought versus Thinking:  Ordinarily, we all know that turning an idea is "thought," but we don't use "thinking." However, the meaning of what is commonly called thought is very vague and refers to different things, including recollection, association, hope, speculation, etc. Therefore, it is better to use "thinking," which is clearer. Thinking is not just random thinking; it must be creative, that is, it must have new discoveries. In one's own opinion, it is newly created and must be consistent with the facts. When thinking, you must use methods of thought, but you must have a purpose, as well as be reflective or critical.

2. The Place of Thinking in Life: George Bernard Shaw said, "Humans use not only thought, but also thinking." If humans cannot think, they cannot adapt to such a complex environment. Because the simplest method for animals is to use "instinct," instinct is a kind of inherited adaptability, rigid and unchanging. It is ridiculous to use instinct alone, while thinking must adapt to circumstances. What is more advanced than instinct is "habit." Habit is a behavior that adapts to a situation. Animals can also be trained to develop habits. Once a habit has been formed, it is difficult to change. Often, as soon as a habit is formed, the situation has changed, so it is also very rigid and not applicable enough. There is also "imitation," which is also an old method. If everyone uses imitation, then human culture cannot progress. Only knowing how to follow others cannot create new things. So, although it is new to the individual, it is still old to the whole, and there is imitation of errors and impropriety, which feels ridiculous. There is also "trial and error." If a problem cannot be solved and there is nothing to imitate, then various methods are tried randomly, or fortunately a suitable one is found, but most of them fail. Sometimes a single trial is unsuccessful, and the second attempt cannot be continued. This is very blind, uneconomical, and even dangerous. Therefore, to achieve a solution economically, the only thing to rely on is thinking. Thinking is planned and creative, different from instinct, habit, and imitation, and also has a degree of difference from "trial and error." Therefore, everything humans do must use thinking. When thinking, there is first a plan in imagination, and then it is done. (To be continued)

### President of the Ruilong Sports Association Plans to Launch a Chinese Football League, Hoping for Sympathy and Cooperation from All Parties, and First Soliciting Registration from Various Teams

Since the Chinese football team has decided to withdraw from the Shanghai Westerners' Football Association, it cannot stop playing football because of this setback. However, the environment on this isolated island is complex, and developing a career is very difficult. In football, the field is the basic requirement. In this city, land is as expensive as gold, and it is even more difficult to find land of fifteen acres or more that is large enough to meet the standard of a football field. However, Zhen Dan University, the Donghua Association's ball field (i.e., the French Army parade ground), and Jiaozhou Park, etc., may not be impossible to use. However, it is difficult to gather things together due to a lack of leadership. Mr. Wang Ruilong, president of the Ruilong Sports Association in this city, in view of this, plans to raise his arms and call for action, taking responsibility for reporting the beginning of the chicken. However, because many hands make light work, and gathering feathers makes a robe, it is hoped that all sectors will give sincere cooperation. A preparatory office has been temporarily set up at the Ruilong Sports Association, No. 5, Lane 271 (Zhaofu Lane), Sanma Road, and the following points are raised to solicit replies, so that basic conditions can be established and active progress can be made. The details are as follows: (1) All teams in this city that are willing to participate in the Chinese League should first indicate their team names and specify the groups (provisionally planned to set up two groups, A and B). It is best to attach a list of players, with at least fourteen and at most eighteen players per team. If you have your own field, or rent a field that can be used for competitions, please state it clearly. (2) If there is open space of about fifteen acres that can be leased or sold, please specify the conditions and contact address, and the name of the person in charge, so that personnel can be sent to contact them. The location is limited to the area within the two concessions, preferably in the Public Concession. (3) If the league can proceed smoothly in the future, the world's latest complex management system will be adopted, that is, each participating team can only send a representative to manage the league, and the Executive Committee will be the highest authority to handle all affairs. The Executive Committee will be elected by ballot, so it will be absolutely open to the outside world. However, with regard to preparatory expenses and self-owned ball fields (if possible), it is planned to adopt the nature of a joint-stock company and issue shares. On this point, please contribute opinions from all sectors to seek collective wisdom and benefit. Mr. Wang said yesterday that his initiation of this competition is entirely for the sake of sports. For half a month, he has only seen calls and waves of support, but no one has come forward to lead, which shows that there are many who are afraid to do it. However, I am absolutely neutral and do not consider fame or profit, so if this move can become a reality, I also plan to add the name of a temporary organization, and will never be subject to the jurisdiction of any party, but will be organized by the public on its own. All parties hope to give sympathy and love.

However, the ball field problem is the most difficult. We hope that all people in the city who are enthusiastic about promoting sports will work together. If there is open space that can be used as a ball field, willing to lend or rent it, to promote this move, please immediately inform the "Sports New Column" of this newspaper, or the Ruilong Sports Association. Furthermore, yesterday, the Mainland News reported that as a result of the Chinese football team withdrawing from the Westerners' Football Association, the loss of the Westerners' Football Association's ticket sales for this season will be more than 200,000 yuan.

Those who fail to gather the right to the championship will be awarded a commemorative bronze medal by the authorities. The club, in accepting the proposal of Cheng Dan and the two gentlemen, plans to take advantage of the final opportunity to invite Shanghai's top table tennis players and male and female table tennis masters to participate in the performance. Tickets are divided into two types, one yuan and two yuan, and the ticket revenue will be used for blind relief expenses. The club believes that this move is of great significance, and has also obtained the approval of Zhu Lianxiang and Zhu Wenwei, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Sports Committee. A preliminary discussion was held a few days ago.

Economic Supplement

### The Stabilization Fund and the Shanghai Black Market

— Translated by Meng Jiamo

From the perspective of the official circles in Chongqing, all foreign exchange transactions in Shanghai whose exchange rate is lower than the pre-war exchange rate are black market transactions. The true legal exchange rate of Chinese currency is still maintained at one shilling and two and a half pence per pound sterling, and three US dollars; this legal exchange rate was set at the time of the Chinese currency reform in 1935, which is more than four times higher than the current Shanghai exchange rate for pound sterling, and almost six times higher for US dollars. However, in the Free China area, Chinese government banks also set a "commercial exchange rate" for importers and exporters that is lower than the pre-war exchange rate. For example, in Chongqing and Kunming, the government has even lower exchange rates for purchasing foreign exchange. For years, the Chinese government has also used the Sino-British Stabilization Fund and its government banks to maintain an exchange rate in Shanghai that is much lower than the legal exchange rate. Now, this new managed currency stabilization fund has come to try its best to maintain the Shanghai foreign exchange market, setting a new official price of 5.3125 US cents per yuan of national currency.

However, the Shanghai black market currently being discussed, in the minds of bankers and the general public, does not immediately refer to the foreign exchange transactions mentioned in the previous section that are lower than the pre-war exchange rate. Strictly legally speaking, this type of transaction is indeed a black market. Now, what we call the Shanghai black market refers to foreign exchange transactions carried out after the freezing of Japanese funds by the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and India, other than those carried out by the fourteen foreign banks licensed to operate foreign exchange, or Chinese banks cooperating with the Central Bank. The exchange rate of this type of transaction is significantly lower than that set by the Stabilization Fund, by about one-tenth. The existence of this black market will threaten the entire commerce of Shanghai in the future. But will this black market continue to exist? Will it permanently occupy an important position in Shanghai commerce? Will importers, exporters, and the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and India still be allowed to use this black market for trade, in addition to settling foreign exchange at the official price with licensed banks or the Stabilization Fund?

How did the Shanghai black market come into being? First of all, it is because there is a large circulation of US dollars in Shanghai. These US dollars can be shipped to the United States at a relatively low cost, and they can be freely deposited into bank accounts, with very free purchase and sale, and even forward transactions. Therefore, the price of each US dollar is about two to two and a half yuan higher than the official price of the Stabilization Fund. However, pound sterling banknotes are conversely lower than the official price of 76 yuan per pound sterling set by the Stabilization Fund by 25 yuan, or 33 percent. The reason is that pound sterling banknotes cannot freely flow into the pound sterling group area, and local British banks and companies, etc., also refuse to accept them except in special circumstances. Therefore, pound sterling banknotes are not as valuable as US dollars in the black market.

Secondly, regarding the supply of black market foreign exchange, there are also many drafts issued by British and American banks before the implementation of the freezing order on July 26. Many of these drafts can still be paid by the paying banks in the United States. However, because many of these funds have ultimately become frozen assets, their value is slightly lower than that of US dollars, which are cash in themselves. In addition, there are many promissory notes and remittances sent to Shanghai from the United States before the freezing order. Most of the people who hold these types of foreign exchange drafts do not exchange them at banks cooperating with the Stabilization Fund, but turn to selling them on the black market, because they are greedy for higher exchange rates.

Finally, there is a large number of export drafts supplied in the black market. There are many exporters in Shanghai: some who are nationals of all-powerful countries, some who operate trade with their own funds, or some who do not rely on the Stabilization Fund and do not interact with licensed banks, sell their export drafts on the black market, and the national currency they receive is 10 to 15 percent higher than selling them to the Stabilization Fund. In recent weeks, the source of black market foreign exchange transactions has mostly been the supply of these export drafts.

As for the buyers of black market foreign exchange: first and foremost, they are importers who cannot apply to the Stabilization Fund for settlement, or merchants who cannot obtain a sufficient supply of foreign exchange; especially for those importers whose goods have arrived in Shanghai and urgently need to pay the full amount of the goods before they can be picked up, or whose shipments have already been shipped from abroad and are on their way to Shanghai, they do not need to worry too much about the foreign exchange purchased on the black market not being useful because the authorities in the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and India have prohibited the export of cargo. Other buyers of black market foreign exchange include: foreigners selling real estate, collectors who are tired of storing foreign currency, and very few speculators, many of whom still believe that freezing funds in the United States is the safest investment.

Currently, the Stabilization Fund is certainly fighting the black market. If foreign exchange can be obtained from the Stabilization Fund, all banks have unanimously withdrawn from the black market; if it is discovered that importers who have applied to the Stabilization Fund for foreign exchange are trading on the black market again, the Stabilization Fund will no longer provide a supply. Banks operating foreign exchange must be upright and honest, and guarantee that foreign exchange obtained from the Stabilization Fund will not flow into the black market. On this point, the Stabilization Fund is also working hard to cut off the main source of the black market. It insists that merchants who have obtained the right to apply to the Stabilization Fund should sell their export drafts to licensed banks at the official price, and those in the banks operating export trade should be forced to settle their export drafts at the official price.

In addition, the circulation of currencies from the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and India in Shanghai should be stopped, and new drafts issued by several banks of the three nationalities should not be allowed to be traded in the black market. If this plan can be implemented, it would be very effective in stopping the source of black market foreign exchange. The Stabilization Fund can also use other measures to crack down on black market transactions; the Stabilization Fund authorities are asking the governments of Washington, London, and Batavia for cooperation in issuing uniform licenses for shipments from Shanghai, which clearly stipulate that foreign exchange proceeds from these shipments must be sold to designated banks at the official price of the Stabilization Fund before they are allowed to be imported. The Stabilization Fund can also negotiate with the US authorities to prohibit the free circulation of US dollars from a certain date, following the British example, and prohibit US commercial banks outside the US border from accepting these US dollars.

The observation of the Shanghai black market seems very bleak. The ABCD democratic countries have the right to restrict trade with Shanghai, which must be carried out through the fourteen licensed banks in accordance with the official price of the Stabilization Fund, and trade between the remaining democratic countries and Shanghai can be completely isolated unless there is smuggling. The value of US dollars in Shanghai can be sanctioned by the US government, causing it to depreciate below the official price of the Stabilization Fund. Drafts issued before the freeze can also be controlled. If these various plans can be implemented in parallel, the source of black market foreign exchange can be cut off, and Shanghai merchants will no longer be confused. If they do not cooperate with the Stabilization Fund, they can only immediately stop their trade with the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and India.

### Shanghai Gold Market and Shanghai-Hong Kong Exchange Rate as New Targets for Speculation

— By Hua Sheng

Becoming Ownerless Wandering Souls

After the Stabilization Fund, with the cooperation of the British and American governments, effectively concentrated the supply and demand of foreign exchange in this city and stabilized the supply exchange rate, the Shanghai gold market, which relied on the rise and fall of the US dollar exchange rate, also lost its target. Because the exchange rate is stable, the gold price converted from the exchange rate is also fixed, and speculative behavior cannot be carried out. The Shanghai gold speculative market, where daily transactions used to be tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands, has become extremely depressed, with daily transactions of less than one hundred. The bleakness can be imagined.

Fluctuations in the gold market and the ups and downs of the exchange rate were originally the two major demons threatening general prices. In recent years, prices have been rising, and the livelihoods of ordinary people have become unspeakably difficult. Although there are many reasons, it is also due to the speculative gold market and foreign exchange speculators. Now the Stabilization Fund is using a method of killing two birds with one stone to eliminate them at the same time, which is more meritorious than building a seven-story pagoda. However, gold and exchange rate speculators are still unwilling to give up and are trying to salvage the situation, hoping to reopen the black exchange market through the activities of the Banque Franco-Italienne. However, since the sources of British and American foreign exchange have been fundamentally blocked, and the Banque Franco-Italienne has no real strength, their struggle is just a waste of effort. Even gold bugs know that their general trend has passed. Therefore, they have fantastic ideas and decided on the 20th of this month to use the Hong Kong exchange rate to settle future gold market futures starting in October. However, will this settlement method be sustainable? It is still a question. Let us first describe the gold market and exchange rate market in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong Gold Market

The Hong Kong gold market is located at No. 14 Massa Street, Sheung Wan; in English, it is called the Chinese Money & Gold Exchange, and its main business is the buying and selling of raw gold and silver, and gold and silver currencies of various countries. There are 246 members, and there are two sessions every day, morning and evening, with two plates in each session. The first plate of the morning session (i.e., the opening price) is at 12:15 p.m., the second plate is at 12:30 p.m., the first plate of the evening session is at 5:55 p.m., and the second plate is at 5:30 p.m. There is no market on Saturdays and Sundays. The main trading items for gold are: (1) gold bars, (2) one-two gold, (3) eight-nine gold, and (4) four-four gold. The settlement price is based on London pure gold and the pound exchange rate. Since the United Kingdom fixed the gold price at eight pounds and eight shillings, and also fixed the Hong Kong dollar at fifteen pence per dollar, the Hong Kong gold market has also been controlled invisibly.

It is necessary to briefly explain the four main trading items mentioned above. In the past, gold speculation in the Hong Kong market was divided into three parts, namely British gold, US gold, and raw gold. British gold is divided into gold blocks and two-one gold. The former is made of London pure gold, which is carried out according to HSBC listings and Reuters telegrams, and is either settled in London or in Hong Kong. This type of transaction has been impossible since the European War. Two-one gold is a British gold coin with a face value of one pound, weighing two mace, one fen, and three li in Chinese weight, hence the name two-one gold. After the First European War, this coin has stopped circulating. This type of transaction in Hong Kong is only for speculation and hoarding. Because of the shortage of spot goods, there is also no transaction to speak of.

US gold has gold blocks, eight-nine gold, and four-four gold. Gold blocks are New York pure gold, and the trading method is the same as operating London pure gold. After the United States controlled the gold market, this type of transaction also no longer exists. Eight-nine gold and four-four gold are both US gold coins. Eight-nine gold, also known as Citibank Big Gold, is a coin with a face value of US$20, weighing eight mace, nine fen, and three li and three hao in Chinese weight. Four-four gold, also known as Citibank Gold, is a coin with a face value of US$10, weighing four mace, four fen, and six li and six hao in Chinese weight, abbreviated as four-four gold. Both are converted according to the US pure gold price and the Hong Kong-US exchange rate. After British gold transactions could not be carried out, Hong Kong speculators focused on eight-nine gold speculation, which seemed to be the center of Hong Kong gold market transactions. Later, due to insufficient chips, after September 1931, four-four gold was used instead.

Gold bars are produced by gold shops; like jewelry gold in silver shops, they are both Hong Kong's local gold transactions. The asking price unit for gold bars is calculated per ounce, and the asking price unit for jewelry gold is calculated per Chinese tael. The price originally followed the transfer of eight-nine gold and today's four-four gold. After the Hong Kong government managed it, it stipulated that the net import price was HK$140 per ounce, and it has remained fixed ever since.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Market

The Shanghai gold market has lost its speculative target and become an ownerless wandering soul. The price of Hong Kong gold bars remains unchanged. It is originally not suitable as a speculative basis; the reason why gold bugs choose Hong Kong gold as the settlement standard is that the drunkard's intention is not in the wine, but in the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange market. In recent years, due to frequent Hong Kong-Shanghai trade relations, the Hong Kong government's control over the Shanghai exchange rate has become tighter and looser, and the policy is uncertain; therefore, the exchange rate has changed frequently and fluctuated greatly, thus becoming the darling of Shanghai gold bugs.

Since 1926, Hong Kong's Shanghai exchange transactions have been concentrated at the Hong Kong North-South Bank (i.e., Bonham West Street), the storefront of Juedelong Bank at No. 36. The trading time is from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. every morning. There are currently more than one hundred members. The market price is calculated as the number of legal currencies per HK$100. Currently, the Shanghai exchange market price is around 460 yuan of legal currency per HK$100, while at this time last year, it was only 412 yuan.

### Ultimately a Waste of Effort

Now the Shanghai gold speculative market stipulates that Hong Kong gold bars and the Shanghai exchange rate will be used as the settlement standard, which will be implemented from next month. The method has been published in the commercial news of this newspaper on the 20th, and the main points are:

(1) The official price of Hong Kong pure gold (i.e., gold bars) is HK$140 per ounce, and each ounce is 0.9953 taels in market weight; that is, 9.953 market taels, which is equal to HK$1,400.

(2) Each Shanghai gold speculative bar is ten market taels, with a purity of 992/1000; the pure gold of each Shanghai gold speculative bar is equal to 9.92 market taels. Converted according to the Hong Kong gold price, each Shanghai gold speculative bar is equal to HK$139,540. This is a fixed number. Dividing this fixed number by the Shanghai exchange rate will be the standard for the Shanghai gold speculative market's month-end settlement price. The formula is:

The current variability of the Shanghai exchange rate is due to two reasons: (1) The ratio of legal currency to Hong Kong dollars in Hong Kong is lower than the ratio of legal currency to Hong Kong dollars in Shanghai. Therefore, speculators in Hong Kong are engaging in large-scale arbitrage, that is, selling legal currency from Hong Kong in Shanghai, buying Hong Kong dollars in the Shanghai market and returning to Hong Kong; exchanging them for legal currency and then shipping them to Shanghai again, and exchanging them for Hong Kong dollars in Shanghai and returning to Hong Kong. Such arbitrage takes the difference, so the Hong Kong exchange rate and the Shanghai Hong Kong dollar exchange rate are both highly variable. If the above-mentioned arbitrage involves transporting cash, it is all smuggling, because Hong Kong has long restricted the export of legal currency. (2) Although Hong Kong's exchange control laws also apply to Shanghai, in order to maintain Hong Kong-Shanghai trade, China's government's request is allowed, so it is more lenient. Therefore, speculators can also operate from it, so the Shanghai exchange rate in Hong Kong fluctuates.

The reasons why Shanghai speculators are now changing to Hong Kong gold and the Shanghai exchange rate as the settlement standard are, in addition to salvaging the speculative situation, also have political implications. Because the Hong Kong government can cooperate with the Chinese government at any time to tighten its control over the Shanghai exchange rate. Once controlled, it will inevitably promote the shrinkage of the Shanghai exchange rate; which is not what Chinese merchants want to hear. Now Shanghai gold speculative prices are settled based on Hong Kong gold and the Shanghai exchange rate. (1) Because the National Government and the Hong Kong government have no intention of tightening control over the Shanghai exchange rate, the market price is highly variable, and Shanghai speculators can therefore prolong their lives. (2) If the Hong Kong government and the National Government tighten control, it will directly promote the shrinkage of the Shanghai exchange rate, indirectly suppress the value of the legal currency, and at the same time make the free zone of China unable to fully utilize the Hong Kong-Shanghai trade relationship to obtain the supply of Shanghai materials. It can be said that it is a far-sighted move and a move that kills two birds with one stone.

However, there are also two reasons why the Hong Kong government and the National Government are relatively laissez-faire about the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate today: that is, (1) the Stabilization Fund's management of the Shanghai exchange market has been successful, at least for the time being; therefore, the flow of legal currency from Hong Kong to Shanghai, although not a good idea for China, has not given people the convenience of arbitraging foreign exchange. (2) If the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange market is relatively free, then Hong Kong-Shanghai trade can be active; this is naturally beneficial to the material needs of the free zone.

However, since Jiangning announced the prohibition of the export of materials at a discount, and the Japanese army tightened its blockade of free Chinese ports, although Hong Kong is outside, the situation has also changed. The National Government and the Hong Kong government have lost the significance of maintaining Hong Kong-Shanghai trade; therefore, they have also lost the significance of maintaining the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate at the same time. In addition, the speculation in the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange market will become more and more widespread due to the relationship between the gold speculative settlement price. Therefore, it is difficult to guarantee that the Stabilization Fund will not cooperate with the Hong Kong government to apply the current method of controlling the US and British exchange rates to the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange market. Therefore, is it possible for this settlement method to last for a long time? It is not optimistic.

### Gasoline Ration Cards

— Dou

Since leaving Shanghai, the abnormal prosperity has offset the war in the minds of those who make a fortune from national calamities: Although they encounter closed doors everywhere and see starving masses trampled by high prices collapsing on the roadside, cars are driving so fast that this impression does not last long in their minds.

As prices soar, ordinary people groan under the pressure, while the automobile class continues to enjoy the blessings of money. What's to fear with money? Shanghai is indeed an isolated island, but as long as ships arrive, there's no fear of not being able to buy anything with money. The number of ships will not stop, even if the British and American merchant ships decrease, there are still Japanese merchant ships!

Alas! They truly haven't realized: In this era of war, the omnipotence of money will ultimately be tested by real materials. Even if you have ships, even if you have inexhaustible money, without real things, it's all useless.

Now ships still arrive as usual, and money is still worshiped, but the purchase of gasoline is subject to restrictions. To get gasoline, you must first obtain a ration card; some people even think this is the result of restricting foreign exchange, but in reality, it is not the case at all. Mainly, it's the lifeblood of this event. Even if producing countries have inexhaustible resources, they must strive to save exports and reserve them for essential needs. Moreover, Britain, the United States, and others are banning oil daily. If the import of gasoline to Shanghai is allowed to continue, the oil ban would be meaningless. These two reasons are the main reasons for restricting gasoline and implementing ration cards this time. Will the people who have generally forgotten the war now regain their impression of the war?

Commercial News

### Yarn Flowers, US and India Cotton Prices Continue to Fall

The New York cotton market continued to show weakness. Prices fell due to foreign merchants selling off. Subsequently, both spot and futures prices fell by 3 to 7 points compared to the previous day. The price of Middling spot cotton was 17.18 cents per pound, equivalent to $358.58 per picul.

The Indian cotton market had no telegraphic report yesterday. It is reported that the unofficial prices have fallen slightly by seven rupees. The price of Oomra was 238 rupees, equivalent to $176.24 per picul. The price of Oomra was equivalent to $128.14 per picul, and the price of Pingguoer was equivalent to $103.22 per picul.

### Miscellaneous, Cigarette Leaf Drafts Can Be Settled, Cigarette Market is Stable

Yesterday, the cigarette market was stable, although the manufacturers still had no goods to distribute, it was known that the drafts for cigarette leaves could be settled, so people's hearts were quite stable. Scattered retail sales seemed slightly active, causing the market to hover. The price of the Great Britain brand was $2,200 per case, the Old Knife brand was $1,840, the Pin Hai brand was $1,400, the Wu Hua brand was $1,170, the Fairy brand was $1,340, the Beauty brand was $1,150, and the Golden Mouse brand was $760.

### Soap and Matches Slightly Tight

The daily necessities market has been hovering for a long time and there have been no major changes. Because the general inside and outside hoarders have been stagnant for a long time, the actual sales also feel weakened. The market opened slightly bullish yesterday because the atmosphere of favorable news for the situation was thick, and the people in the industry were tense. The market price of fixed soap was $59.50 per case, Bai Xiangmao was $50, Huang Xiangmao was $47, Arrow Knife soap was $53, Beauty brand matches were $1,070, Phoenix brand was $1,015, and Sailboat brand candles were $36.50.

### Piece Goods, Summer Discounted Woolen Fabrics

— Also Hoarded —

Summer woolen fabrics that have been discounted for a long time have recently been targeted by hoarders. Both large and small quantities have been heavily stockpiled. White serge, white straight tribute, fat leather, and Van Ertong, etc., are being piled up even more frantically, causing their prices to suddenly skyrocket. Those who hold the goods are particularly afraid that there will be no goods on the market next year, and most are unwilling to sell in whole batches.

### Medicinal Materials, Galangal Rises Sharply

Galangal is becoming scarce due to the lack of supply, and the market inventory is gradually running out, so the price has risen sharply by 20 to 30 yuan. The recent market price for large galangal is 100 yuan, Shen Zhuang is 90 yuan, and small galangal is 80 yuan. The trend is firm.

### Gardenia Goods on the Way

Gardenia was previously scarce in origin, and the numbered goods had already sold out, so the market was extremely firm. According to a letter from the numbered firm, a batch of goods has been shipped and is on the way. The cost is higher than before and will arrive in Shanghai soon.

### Coal, Boshan Bituminous Coal Weak

Boshan bituminous coal has been very weak in the market recently due to factory shutdowns and hoarding by hoarders. Both the unofficial market and the official market have fallen across the board, dropping by 10 yuan. Currently, Boshan bituminous coal, the same industry warehouse order, is 445 yuan per ton. The lower-grade chips have entered the 400 yuan level, and are also traded within 393 to 4 yuan. The warehouse station trucks are subject to additional levies.

### Duff Cooper Prepares to Visit Shanghai, British Community Has Prepared to Welcome Him, Marshall and Others Form a Five-Person Committee, British Intelligence Agency Has Not Yet Received Notification, US-Japan Relations Side Refuses to Disclose Opinions on Duff Cooper's Visit to Shanghai

According to foreign sources, it is confirmed that Duff Cooper, the British government's special envoy to the Far East, is indeed preparing to visit Shanghai with his advisor Casey, former British military attaché to the Japanese embassy Major General Pigott, and other military personnel after inspecting the situation in various parts of the Far East. The purpose of this trip is to inspect the actual situation in this city and hold discussions with local officials. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British ambassador to China, is currently in Singapore meeting with Cooper, but it is not yet known whether Kerr will travel to Shanghai with Cooper. It is reported that the British officialdom and community in this city have formed a five-person committee to prepare to welcome Cooper. The members are Marshall, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, Heimann, general manager of HSBC, RG Woodhead, secretary of the Shanghai Power Company, British Consul General George, and Philip, director-general of the Shanghai Municipal Council. In addition to sending a telegram of welcome, they are also making arrangements in advance.

British Community Hopes Are Extremely Eager

The "Continental Daily News" reported that Casey, manager of Jardine Matheson and former chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is now serving as Duff Cooper's special advisor and will accompany him to Shanghai. The reporter inquired about this information from Alexander, the British intelligence commissioner in this city. He said that he had not yet received official notification and therefore could not comment. However, the British community in this city is very eager for Cooper to visit Shanghai. It is said that Shanghai still occupies an important position in the international situation, so they hope that Cooper and his wife Diana will visit Shanghai.

Chinese Side Attaches Great Importance

The Chinese side in Shanghai believes that the activities and mission of Duff Cooper's visit to Shanghai will be an important factor in the UK's decision on its future Far East policy. Cooper's visit is fundamentally to strengthen the UK's war organization in the Far East. On the other hand, understanding the actual situation in China is also one of the main purposes of this trip. The British ambassador to China, Kerr, went to Singapore to meet with Cooper, which is proof of this. Moreover, at a time when US-Japan talks have not completely stopped, the activities of the British special envoy to the Far East will inevitably be given considerable importance by the Chinese side.

Concession Issue Will Inevitably Be Discussed

According to well-informed sources, if Cooper's visit to Shanghai is true, then the issue of the Shanghai concessions will become one of the focal points of discussion between Cooper and relevant Shanghai officials. Mr. Casey, the current advisor to Cooper and former chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, will definitely explain to Cooper the truth about the Shanghai International Settlement that he has encountered during his one-year term as chairman. Well-informed people have repeatedly urged the British and American countries to support the status quo of Shanghai with a strong posture, and not to allow the administrative sovereignty of the concessions to be fragmented. For this reason, after Cooper's visit to Shanghai, there will be important decisions on the attitude that the British side should take on the concession issue. At the same time, Cooper will maintain important contacts with American officials in Shanghai through the issue of the Shanghai concessions, so that the cooperation between the UK and the US in Shanghai will be stronger.

US and Japan Refuse to Disclose Opinions

Regarding Casey's visit to Shanghai, relevant parties dare not express a definite opinion. When Casey left Shanghai in May of this year, he said that he would return to Shanghai only after the end of the war. At that time, Casey's stated reason for leaving Shanghai was to return to the UK to visit his family. After arriving in the US, he stayed in various places in Washington and New York to discuss with the US shipping authorities on adjusting ship transportation in the Pacific. Later, after Cooper arrived in the US from the UK, Casey was hired as an advisor and followed Cooper to the Far East. If Cooper is indeed going to visit Shanghai, it is very likely that Casey will come along. As for the views of the Japanese and American sides in Shanghai on Cooper's visit, the relevant parties believe that the time is not yet ripe and refuse to disclose them.

### Thirty-One Commercial Banks, Deposits Double Loans, Hinterland Fixed Deposit Interest Rate Increased to Two Points, Port Deposit Interest Reduced to Maximum of Eight Li

After the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China and Farmers Bank of China, were ordered to encourage the internal transfer of port funds, they specially formulated unified domestic remittance methods, and determined remittance methods for the hinterland with reference to market conditions. Anyone who remits Shanghai general remittance bills to the hinterland can receive cash in full in any part of the rear, and strive to increase the deposit interest rate in the hinterland. As for the commercial banks, in view of the ever-changing international situation, various businesses strive to be prudent in order to accumulate sufficient reserves, and cooperate with the four national banks to implement the established policy of assisting the government in guiding floating capital, so that excess floating capital can be transferred to the interior.

Total Deposits Exceed 100 Million

A reporter from the New Sheng News Agency inquired from the bank yesterday that the total deposits of 31 commercial banks including Zhejiang Xing and Shanghai Zhejiang as of the end of the 29th year of the Republic of China were 100,024,998,112 yuan. Including current commercial deposits of 64,100,000,523 yuan, fixed commercial deposits of 17,277,691,911 yuan, savings deposits of 75,900,048,812 yuan, trust deposits of 329,645 yuan, interbank deposits of 58,833,7046 yuan, special deposits of 2,354,050 yuan, and other deposits of 10,425,512,121 yuan.

Loan Amount Only Exceeds 50 Million

The loan amount of each commercial bank is 50,121,964,641 yuan, including 16,923,436,367 yuan for current loans, 10,259,899,960 yuan for fixed loans, 36,401 yuan for discounts, 314,575 yuan for mortgages, and 12,903,533,336 yuan for other loans. According to the above-mentioned commercial banks, the deposit exceeds the loan amount by one time, which proves that there are few investment avenues in Shanghai, and at the same time, for the sake of prudence, loans to Shanghai are particularly prudent in order to consolidate the foundation of the bank itself.

Guiding Floating Capital in Shanghai to the Interior

After the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China and Farmers Bank of China, as well as the Central Trust Bureau and the Postal Remittance Bureau, were ordered to increase interest rates in the hinterland, the fixed deposit interest rate was uniformly increased to 1 to 2 points, depending on the length of the term. The current interest rate on current deposits is 5 to 8 li, and various preferential interest increase methods have been formulated. As for the interest rates of commercial banks in the corresponding areas, they have successively revised and increased them. However, the deposit interest rates in Shanghai and other ports have been reduced separately. The maximum fixed deposit interest rate is 8 li, and the current deposit interest rate ranges from 1 to 3 li, and various preferential interest increase methods have been cancelled. It is stipulated that when the deposit exceeds a certain amount, the excess part will not be calculated as interest. Commercial banks in Shanghai handle the collection of inland deposits with preferential interest rates, and the purpose is also to guide the floating capital in Shanghai to the interior.

### Changsha Telegram, Due to War Outside the City, Commercial Telegrams are Sometimes Suspended

According to news from yesterday, a unit of Japanese troops entered Changsha city and engaged in street fighting with the Chinese army. After inquiring from various parties, this is not confirmed. The most prominent example is that the American news agency still received and sent wireless telegrams from Changsha to Shanghai yesterday. Commercial telegrams from Shanghai to Changsha were also received and sent as usual, and it was said that the time was fast, only taking half a day to reach the destination. Although the agency has stopped receiving and sending commercial telegrams from Shanghai to Changsha, this is because there is war in the area around Changsha. It is difficult to deliver commercial telegrams. However, telegraphic transfers from post offices and banks can still be communicated as usual. As for the Great Northern Telegraph Company, business parties can still send telegrams as usual, and the Great Eastern Telegraph Company only stopped commercial telegrams, which shows that the situation in Changsha yesterday did not change.

### Resolution of the Photography and Plate Making Workers' Strike

Wage increase of 12 yuan. The photography and plate making industry workers in this city started a strike on the 16th of this month. The two parties negotiated the afternoon before yesterday. With repeated concessions, a satisfactory solution was reached. All workers resumed work yesterday. The method is that the plate-making workers and carpenters will all receive a wage increase of 12 yuan. Apprentices will receive a wage increase of 3 yuan within three years, and 5 yuan within five years. The catering will be provided by the employer, and those who take care of themselves will receive an additional catering fee of 60 yuan per month.

### The Chamber of Commerce's Hong Kong Office Requests Continued Refugee Relief Donations

The Hong Kong office of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent letters to various important industries in this city regarding donations for refugee relief, stating that the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has been doing its best to carry out refugee relief work since its establishment, relying on the enthusiastic support and generous donations from various industries to achieve this righteous act. According to the association, in addition to sending refugees away in succession, there are still more than 10,000 refugees being accommodated. When it was established in the 17th year, the living expenses per person per month only needed about 2 yuan. Now, due to high prices, each person needs about 16 yuan per month, an increase of eight times compared to before. They also need to be dispersed separately, which requires a large amount of money. In the past, various industries stipulated two types of donations: business commissions and salary commissions. The donation period is about to expire, and it is proposed to send separate letters to discuss whether to continue to be responsible. The situation of more than 10,000 refugees still needs to be continued after the refugees have been relocated. Now that prices are rising day by day and a large amount of money is needed, all donations recognized by various industries are still requested to be handled in accordance with the original plan, so that the relief work will not be interrupted, and more than 10,000 disaster victims will be grateful.

### Gasoline Rationing System Implemented, Strict Limits on Usage, Consumption Can Be Reduced by Two-Fifths, Oil is also Reduced Simultaneously

According to investigations, there are 12,000 private cars in the city (7,000 in the International Settlement and 9,000 in the French Concession), 4,000 trucks, and 800 motorized bicycles (500 in the International Settlement and 300 in the French Concession). From today onwards, it will be impossible to obtain gasoline without obtaining a "gasoline distribution card." The measures taken by each company are recorded as follows:

Purchase Oil with a Certificate

(1) From today onwards, purchase oil with a certificate. All gas stations will stop supplying other customers. (2) Each gas station will supply gasoline according to the quantity specified on the "gasoline distribution card," and shall not exceed it. The maximum limit for each payment shall not exceed 10 gallons. (3) Currently, due to the lack of oil tankers, each company has no other good policy except to take follow-up measures in order to try to extend the supply time of existing gasoline as much as possible. If the situation can be gradually improved in the future, a notice will be issued to cancel this restriction.

Strict Measures

(4) The allocation of oil is based on the direct environment. The quantity allocated at present may be subject to further reduction. If this is the case, all circumstances and the percentage of reduction will be announced in the daily newspaper. A new gasoline distribution card will be issued on November 1, at which time the old card must be returned and exchanged for a new card. (5) The issued gasoline distribution card is not allowed to be mortgaged or transferred. Gas stations only sell gasoline to vehicles with the license plate number noted on the gasoline distribution card. (6) When the vehicle has stopped being used, please return the gasoline distribution card. If the license plate number is changed or the address is moved, please notify us immediately by letter for record. (7) When purchasing gasoline, you must hand over the gasoline distribution card to the manager of the gas station so that he can use pliers to squeeze out the amount of oil purchased on the card for identification. (8) The purchase of gasoline must be in cash. (9) Gasoline companies do not have any obligations for issuing this new card, and do not guarantee the total amount of oil supplied by the new card.

Future Consumption

According to reports, although the owner of an average medium-sized car applies for 30 or 40 gallons of gasoline per month, the company authorities only approve 23 gallons, which is less than 1 gallon per day. Therefore, if the number of rides per day is slightly higher, there will be a feeling of insufficient gasoline. It is also learned that, starting from today, major oil companies will also send personnel to each gas station to check the daily station oil inventory and consumption quantity. According to a large estimate by a certain gasoline merchant, after the implementation of the gasoline distribution card, the daily sales quantity of major companies is about 6,000 gallons. Before the gasoline was restricted, the daily amount was about 30,000 gallons. After the implementation of this quota distribution system, the gasoline sold is only three-fifths of the original amount. In addition, the oil used by British public buses will also be reduced by 20% starting from today.

### Yuezhou Ship Fire Damages Goods, Handling General Average

The Taikoo company's Yuezhou ship returned to Shanghai from Tianjin on the morning of the 27th and docked at Pier No. 3 of the company's Bund in the French Concession. When the longshoremen were busy unloading the cargo around 4 pm, a fire suddenly broke out in the head compartment. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that in addition to the miscellaneous goods loaded in the head compartment of the ship being destroyed by fire, the rest were soaked by the water used to extinguish the fire. The Peking carpets transported from Tianjin must be transferred to the UK, so they are the most valuable, and some of them are also damaged. The company is preparing for general average for the damaged goods on the ship. The ship was ordered to sail to the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong around 4 pm yesterday to remove the damaged goods, so that the average can be accounted for by the notary public. Freight customers can register with the company today to handle the general average formalities.

### Save on Mid-Autumn Festival Extravagance and Engage in Disaster Relief

And Promote Winter Clothing Movement

The Municipal Festival Saving Movement Committee previously issued a notice, calling on people from all walks of life to actively promote the winter clothing movement, and the Shangjiao Moral Charity Association requested all walks of life to save on Mid-Autumn Festival extravagance, relieve hidden poverty and street refugees, and carry out porridge and rice distribution work. As the weather is getting colder, there is an urgent need for cotton clothes to keep out the cold. Refugees in Shanghai are crying for food and shivering in the cold, and the situation is tragic. Therefore, we especially ask people from all walks of life to act on their conscience and enthusiastically donate to fulfill their national duties.

### Bank Warehouse Business Rules Revised by the Banking Association

The Shanghai Banking Industry Warehouse Business Rules were announced and implemented by the Banking Industry Association on October 1st of the tenth year of the Republic of China. After the government adopted the legal currency policy, many of the provisions were inconsistent. In March of the 26th year, it was submitted to the Warehouse Subcommittee for re-revision. In May of the same year, it was reviewed and approved by the Practical Research Association, and then reviewed and implemented by the Association. By the winter of the 27th year, due to war relations, business conditions changed a lot, and if a part of the rules was not revised, it would not be able to meet the needs of the facts. Therefore, discussions began in the 28th year and were completed in the autumn of the 30th year. During the meeting, opinions were widely sought from all parties, and repeated studies were conducted without being too detailed. The summary of the revision案 is as follows (the full text has a total of five chapters and 53 articles):

Stipulate the Types of Warehouse Business

Types of warehouse business: (1) Custody of entrusted goods, (2) Rental of warehouse rooms, (3) Ancillary business. No interest will be paid on the security deposit or other funds received by the warehouse in its business operations. Warehouse rent is calculated on a monthly basis. If it is less than one month, it will also be calculated as one month even if it is one day. The depositor should keep the seal for the entrusted goods for verification when picking up the goods or transferring ownership. Otherwise, the warehouse will not be responsible for accidents. The value of the entrusted goods is more than 700 yuan per piece or special attention should be paid to it during storage. The depositor should state it in the application form. The warehouse may refuse to accept the following types of goods, and may cancel the contract even if it has been agreed: (1) Dangerous goods, (2) Contraband, (3) Incompletely packaged goods, (4) Goods that are easy to rot and damage or deteriorate, (5) Goods that the warehouse deems unsuitable for storage or that may damage the warehouse or other goods.

Cancel the Storage Deadline and Evacuate

The warehouse may cancel the storage contract with the depositor or warehouse holder and limit the time for evacuation of the entrusted goods in one of the following circumstances: (1) Discovering that the entrusted goods have dangerous or contraband items, etc., (2) Arrears of warehouse rent and other expenses for more than six months, (3) The warehouse deems that the value of the entrusted goods is insufficient to cover the warehouse rent and its expenses, (4) The warehouse building is completely or partially renovated, (5) The warehouse address is relocated, (6) The warehouse is completely or partially closed. After receiving the notice in the preceding paragraph, the depositor or warehouse warrant holder shall pay the warehouse rent and various expenses in full and evacuate the entrusted goods as soon as possible. If the warehouse is delayed and ignored, the warehouse may move the entrusted goods to another place or auction them to offset the warehouse rent and other expenses from the proceeds. The surplus will be returned and the deficiency will be recovered.

The Warehouse Bears the Responsibility for Compensation

The warehouse is only responsible for compensation for damage to the entrusted goods directly due to the warehouse's intentional or gross negligence. The calculation of the damage compensation is based on the market price of the entrusted goods when they enter the warehouse, or based on the market price at the time of damage. The warehouse has the right to consider the handling. If the depositor has not declared in advance, the amount of damage compensation shall not exceed 700 yuan in national currency per piece. The warehouse shall not be liable for damage to the entrusted goods due to natural disasters, earthquakes, floods, fires, soldiers, thieves, insect injuries, rat bites, humidity, mold, dryness, erosion, strikes, epidemics, and all other irresistible or avoidable circumstances. The warehouse shall also not be liable for damages due to sunlight, rain, wind, sand, frost, snow, and other unavoidable damages for those who are placed outside the fixed warehouse or in the open air. In case of damage, the depositor or warehouse warrant holder shall still be responsible for paying the warehouse rent before the damage is compensated.

### Mail to Soviet Russia and Europe Will Be Sealed and Dispatched in Stages Today

Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German War, the Siberian postal line has only been used by the Soviet Union and neighboring countries. At 8 pm today (29th), a batch of mail will be loaded onto a train and transported via this line. Although the mail to Kiev and Leningrad is in a fierce war zone, the Shanghai Post Office still accepts and sends it as usual. Whether it can reach the destination depends on the situation at that time. In the afternoon of the 29th, the Shanghai Postal Administration will have a large batch of mail to Europe and the United States, totaling more than 1,000 bags, loaded onto the American mail ship President Pierce and transported to Europe from Shanghai. It is estimated that the postal journey will arrive in the United States at the end of next month, and will be transported to various parts of Europe in early November.

### Residents of McTyeire Terrace Oppose Subdivided Sale of Apartments: Failure to Curb This Trend Will Impoverish the People

Due to the oppression by landlords and the threat of "subdivided sales," the residents of McTyeire Terrace on Avenue MacMahon in the French Concession have jointly submitted a letter to various sectors, arguing that in this isolated post-calamity island where the population has surged and finding housing is extremely difficult, real estate speculators are unscrupulously resorting to ingenious maneuvers, making transfer illusions, and forcing evictions to raise rents. This has plunged renters throughout the city into extreme panic, affecting the entire society and harming people's livelihoods.

Gasping for Survival

From now on, anyone living in alleyway housing will feel insecure. Moreover, most renters have small leases, and among them, many are small businesses. Relocating their shops is unrealistic and, if their business is affected, it would indirectly threaten their livelihood. One small move affects the entire situation, and the negative consequences are beyond description. Alas, our common people are already gasping for survival amidst unprecedented price struggles, and now this serious housing problem has emerged. What hope is there for a peaceful and prosperous life?

Prejudicial to Public Order

We believe that this speculative activity, which disturbs the majority of citizens and is prejudicial to public peace, must be opposed resolutely. In addition to uniting with oppressed alleyway residents throughout the city to petition the authorities of both Concessions and the judicial administration for impartial relief to seek a thorough solution and realize the protection of Article 420 of the Civil Code, we humbly offer the following points for public discussion based on our limited perspectives.

Speculating for Profit

(1) Selling apartments within a building is a legitimate property transaction, and no one should interfere arbitrarily. However, recently, abuses have been rampant, ultimately resulting in the property being reclaimed for personal use, forcing eviction, intimidation, and deception. Therefore, such real estate transactions are purely speculative and profit-driven and should not be considered legitimate business. All sectors should pay attention to this point and find ways to stop it to prevent future occurrences.

Creating Complications
(2) In the case of houses sold in subdivided manner, there should be attention to the necessary conditions for the subdivided house, such as not having connected roofing or walls, and all public utilities can be separated. If this subdivided house has connected features, then it is possible for the living room, kitchen and everything else to be sold separately, creating many difficulties for all future tenants.

Find a Way to Stop It

(3) The abuses of subdivided sales, as mentioned above, are enough to cause major panic among city residents. Therefore, this matter is not merely a housing dispute, but an entire social problem. We urge the authorities of both Concessions and the judicial administration to find ways to stop it, or ask the competent authorities to establish a "Housing Dispute Committee" to handle this type of dispute, to maintain people's livelihoods and social stability, which is what citizens urgently need and desire.

Consider Public Opinion

(4) We request the Concession courts to give some consideration to public opinion in future cases of this type. This is the most effective and only solution. This is not the people interfering with the judiciary, and historically, court rulings have mostly favored the renters, as the citizens have seen. What needs to be added is that these landlords are very cunning, and they often exploit the renters' minor weaknesses during lawsuits, attacking them individually, making it impossible for the renters to defend themselves. The courts are thus misled. Once they win a lawsuit, they will exploit the law, and this should be deeply guarded against.

### Details of the Kidnapping of Fei Ziyi at the Entrance of Lianzhu Alley, Avenue Edward VII: Abducted After Leaving His Concubine's Residence

At 0:15, a kidnapping occurred at the entrance of Lianzhu Alley on Avenue Edward VII in the International Settlement. Due to the lateness of the hour and the impending curfew, a detailed investigation was not possible at the time. The following are further details of the case:

Wives Separated

Fei Ziyi, a 65-year-old from Wuhan, previously owned the Deyu pawnshop in his hometown, which was destroyed by artillery fire during the war. Fei's family sought refuge in Shanghai, housing his two wives separately. His wife, Mrs. Lu (54 years old), resided at 44 Lianzhu Alley, Avenue Edward VII, while his concubine, Mrs. Wang (37 years old), lived upstairs at Guangrentang in Sanfeng Alley, Chengdu Road. Fei, having some savings, usually had a car (license plate 4862) driven by a local driver, Gu Liugen, and another chartered car (license plate 6429) driven by a Qidong native, Yuan Sheng.

Kidnapped on the Way Home

Fei usually visited his concubine every evening and stayed until late at night. On the evening before last, Fei took his chartered car to the house of his concubine. Because the curfew was approaching, he took the car home. Near the entrance to Lianzhu Alley, three kidnappers suddenly pounced, threatening him with guns, dragging him out, forcing him into a black compact car parked nearby, and speeding off. Afterwards, the driver, Yuan Sheng, reported the incident to Fei's wife, who informed the police to investigate Fei's whereabouts.

### Former Qingdao Municipal Government Official Arrested by Japanese: Another Person Arrested on Rue Amiral Bayle

A certain Zhou, a former official of the Qingdao Municipal Government from Shaoxing, currently residing at 175 Rue Cardinal Mercier in the French Concession and currently unemployed, was arrested by the Japanese on the previous evening. Japanese plainclothes officers drove to the French Concession police station in Zikawei, requesting additional Chinese and Western detectives to accompany them to arrest Zhou. He was taken back to the police station, briefly questioned regarding his name, age, and origin, and then handed over to the Japanese and taken to Hongkou.

Also, at 7:30 yesterday morning, Japanese plainclothes officers drove to the French Concession police station, requesting to dispatch personnel to 153 Rue Amiral Bayle to arrest a Chinese man. It is learned that the arrested person is named Long Zhou from Suzhou, who worked at the Minsheng Shiye Company. According to the Japanese, the reason for the arrest is that the equipment used on the Minsheng Shiye Company's ship "Minniu" belonged to the Chinese government. The Japanese have requested the French police to hand over the arrested person for interrogation in Hongkou.

### A Page of Lincoln's Family's History of Hatred

— Xu Baiyi

An Inevitable Walk

During his life, Lincoln often took a child for a walk, and did so frequently during his 22 years of marriage. Did he love walking? Perhaps; however, the main reason was arguing with his wife. His wife had a very bad temper; servants, water carriers, or delivery people were all subjected to scolding, and in most cases, Lincoln often succumbed. Initially, he would just laugh it off, but laughter could not stop her temper, so in later instances, he used walking as a way to cope; however, when he returned home, the noise would start again.

Lincoln's married life was truly unhappy. His wife came from a wealthy family and was a local social butterfly, with the magic "to make a pastor forget his prayers." She loved dressing up and squandering money, while Lincoln came from a poor family and was a great man who succeeded entirely through his own efforts.

Differences in personality between husband and wife naturally lead to all sorts of friction, so young men and women should carefully study the other person's personality when choosing a partner and must not be careless. At the same time, we can better understand Lincoln's greatness. Although he was in a troubling environment, he was still able to accomplish great feats. Couples who enjoy a happy married life, how should they strive to benefit humanity!

Furthermore, if Lincoln's wife could understand Lincoln's greatness and give him the greatest cooperation, then Lincoln's contributions to humanity would certainly be greater and more astonishing, I think.

### About Our Bodies

— Li

A person's body has enough electricity to light a 25-watt light bulb for up to three minutes.

From our hair, we can see if there are any blood diseases. If blood circulation is abnormal or a person has anemia, their hair is often dull.

Most speech disorders are created between the ages of three and eight, so children should pay attention when learning to speak.

The feeling of fear is enough to affect blood circulation and tighten the skin, so it is actually possible for hair to stand on end from fear.

Worry and fear are enough to cause tooth decay. Recently, an American lost nine teeth in three weeks because his wife was seriously ill during that time.

When we sleep, our brains contract, and our bodies expand because most of the blood flows to other parts of the body.

Because the acidity on our skin is different, some people are more likely to attract mosquitoes and bedbugs, while others are never bitten by them at all.

Our saliva and stomach acid are the most effective germicides in the body.

### Future Fathers Training Center

— Li Si Hua

The Maternity Center Association of New York, USA, in order to ensure the safety of mothers and babies, has specially organized a future father training center, where a group of men who are about to become fathers receive training. The training courses include a lesson on bathing wax dolls.

The organization of this new undertaking is because no fewer than 10,000 people die annually in the United States from childbirth (said to be the most in the world; Norway has the lowest maternal mortality rate, accounting for 2.6 per thousand). Of the 2.25 million babies born each year in the United States, 75,000 die right after being born.

Therefore, the responsibility of men in the United States has invisibly increased. They cannot just think that they have fulfilled their responsibilities by being able to afford household expenses. They must receive preparation and training for fatherhood after their wives become pregnant.

During the training period, a future father must do the following:

1. Accompany his wife to see a doctor before she is three months pregnant.

2. Accompany his wife for a walk nearby so that she gets plenty of air and exercise.

3. Because pregnant women are easily noticed when they go outside, take his wife to places with fewer people.

4. Prepare all the things needed for the baby.

5. Learn how to bathe a baby.

6. Arrange the hospital or doctor for delivery a few months before delivery.

7. After the birth of the baby, the family life will change from then on, especially when the first baby is born. The father will take on more of the heavy work.

8. Set aside some time each day to play with the baby.

### Housewife's Notes

Clothes stained with summer stains can be washed with warm water to remove sweat stains.

Hammering nails into the wall often damages the paint on the wall, but if you soak the nail in hot water first and then hammer it in, it won't be a problem.

When the coal stove gets too hot, sprinkle water on the coal to reduce the flames.

To sharpen dull scissors, you can use the scissors to cut a large piece of sandpaper into small pieces. After cutting, the scissors will be sharp again.

After putting the eggs into the bowl, add a little salt to make it easier to beat the eggs.

To make the light bulb emit the greatest light, it is a good method to wipe it with a slightly damp cloth.

### Proper Method of Hanging Frames

From the frames a person hangs, one can see his personality. A person who loves sports will hang a few photos of sports. A person who loves drama will use frames decorated with drama as the theme.

However, ordinary people use a hook to hang frames, so the line for hanging the frame becomes a triangle (as shown in the figure). In fact, the proper method should be as shown in the picture on the left, because this can match the molding of the house and is much more beautiful.

### Small Statistics

— Qian Ying

Every building in Shanghai has bedbugs,

The total number of citizens is five million,

Each person is sucked of one cc of blood by bedbugs every night,

The total amount of blood sucked by bedbugs every night is equal to a dan of water; if all the bedbugs in the city are caught,

Several trains can be filled.

### Weekly Home Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Time flies so fast. This Sunday is the Mid-Autumn Festival. In the homes of the wealthy, they must set up banquets and celebrations on the night of reunion, while in ordinary families, they will inevitably eat better, especially taro stewed with edamame, as if it cannot be considered the Mid-Autumn Festival without taro and edamame. Both of these things are rich in vitamins, and eating them not only fits the festival scene but is also beneficial to the body. The taro does not need to be peeled, but it must be stewed until soft. The edamame does not need to be shelled, but it must be stewed until crispy. When stewing, just add some salt. Those with strong digestion can eat more, while those with stomach problems should eat less. "Taro Stewed Beans" in the Sunday menu is the abbreviation of taro stewed with edamame.

Spring and Autumn

### Reasonable Austerity

— Pingye

After the power company established restrictions for users, now the gasoline company is issuing gasoline purchase permits for fuel consumption, and is also implementing gradual control. Originally, in this national crisis, it is only right and proper for everyone to restrain their material desires. However, while many users understand this, there are bound to be some who feel inconvenienced. In fact, the phenomenon of wives shopping and young masters going to school, frequently spending foreign exchange to buy gasoline for transportation, is no longer appropriate today. This gasoline control should be a good reminder for those who have failed to be self-restrained in the past.

The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and of course many people cannot avoid the customs. But in reality? "Gazing at the bright moon together, we should shed tears," "Only grieving for not seeing the reunion of the nine provinces." Who can bear to waste money and indulge in extravagance? Even if one is fortunate enough to profit from business, isn't it all given by the general public's groans and sighs? In that case, receiving from society, it is best to seek welfare for society. At the very least, we should not create a wasteful trend that harms society.

Rather than extravagance, let us choose thrift. I hope the citizens of Shanghai will actively practice frugality, help themselves and others, understand each other, and fulfill their respective responsibilities, without being restricted by customs. We must know that the fraction of financial resources we save today is cultivating our future happiness.

### Mr. Zhang Shutong's Humorous New Couplets

— Qingjing

My friend, Mr. Zhang Shutong, is skilled in calligraphy and painting, tracing back to Dong Yuan and emulating Xuanzai. His paintings, in the style of Confucian scholars, are indeed different from those of painters. Mr. Zhang is elegant and unrestrained, his mind as clear as a bright breeze and a clear moon, untouched by any dust. Therefore, his paintings are also refined and transcend the mundane, greatly different from the murky atmosphere of today. Recently, requests for Mr. Zhang's calligraphy and paintings have been pouring in, so he has closed his doors to guests and dedicated himself to calligraphy and painting for several years now, ignoring everything else. Mr. Zhang also enjoys elegant humor, not bound by cumbersome formalities, resembling figures like Zheng Banqiao and Li Liweng. Now, Mr. Zhang is sixty-five years old. Looking at his playful self-congratulatory couplet and the couplets he wrote for others, we can already see a glimpse of his humor:

Looking up to the sky and laughing, laughing at wasting more than sixty years, a rice bag and a wine bag, actually consuming quite a lot; looking at my shadow and feeling sorry for myself, pitying my dignified seven-foot body, following the current and drifting along, achieving nothing, what to do?

Drawing flowers, writing characters, and reading ancient and modern books, all have their own interest; boiling tea, smoking, and talking witty words are also enough to delight the mood.

Here, we only talk about romance and beauty, not about politics. If you are a passionate person, please refrain from opening your mouth;

Inside the room, there are both flowers and trees, and also qin and books. If you are a refined gentleman, you may as well visit often.

Home is everywhere, sitting is fine, lying down is also fine, there is absolutely no restraint; be patient and calm, since you have come, be at ease, you can chat casually.

No vulgar rhymes, no noisy dust, living alone in leisure, entering my lighthearted thoughts, the autumn moon is white; there are qin, books, flowers, and trees, the windows are bright and the table is clean, welcoming people with refreshing air, the distant mountains are green.

Although this place is narrow and overflowing with dust, fortunately, there are calligraphy, painting, qin, and chess, you can use them to pass the time as you like; on the seat are many learned scholars and great men, if you talk about romance and beauty, it is enough to expand my mind.

You are coming? Very welcome. The universe is vast, a fly is tiny, feel free to discuss casually; are you bored? There are plenty of ways to pass the time, flowers and plants nourish the heart, poetry and books nourish the spirit, you can indulge in dissipation as you like.

The flowing water and high mountains place their interest outside the mundane world; listening to incense, reading paintings, and appreciating the heart are in the ability of the wonderful.

### Glass Cuts Rickshaw Puller

— A Reader

This incident has happened more than once in our alley - the feet of rickshaw pullers are cut by broken glass.

Speaking of which, this is really wrong. There is clearly a garbage truck in the alley, but some people insist on dumping all sorts of things at the door, and broken glass is naturally thrown out casually. I really don't know if those people, when they see the poor man's bleeding feet and painful groans, will think that they are the culprits.

Yesterday, when I came home, I saw a rickshaw parked in front of my house. The rickshaw puller was sitting in front of a house not far away. A kind old lady across the street was helping him take out the broken glass and bandage his feet, but blood was still flowing from the cloth. The rickshaw puller pitifully complained, "The rickshaw is rented from the British Concession, it costs more than three yuan a day. I finally pulled a Russian, only got more than two dimes, but I cut my foot, bad luck!" I came in and told my mother, and my mother told me to give him two dimes. But can two dimes help him? Although others also give him money, he may have a wife and children. The money people give him may not even be enough for the rickshaw rent.

(Editor's Note) On the road, these kinds of heartbreaking things are common. There is broken glass, and even more banana peels and melon rinds, etc. Those who discard them do so easily, but those who unfortunately step on them, fall, and suffer serious injuries suffer endlessly. Someone who pushes these kinds of harmful things to the side of the road is doing a public service.

Twelve Unexpected Storms

"Understood, we will send someone to inquire tomorrow." Patrol Chief Li instructed Manager Meng to write down Begonia's name on a piece of white paper, and said it in such a grand manner.

However, before their brothers went to the countryside, Zhao Yukun had already quietly returned that evening and told Begonia everything he had done, and also taught him in detail what he should say when he saw the people in Manager Meng's family, and how he should answer if the police came to inquire. Therefore, he was simply waiting at the Begonia's house.

The next day, at noon, the North River Town Police Branch indeed sent a patrol officer and two policemen to Zhangshucun. They first found Begonia's house and, putting on a very serious look, questioned him about many things.

Begonia's spirit had improved a lot in the past two days. "Gentlemen, it should be my turn to speak now." He sat on the kang, very carefully answering many of their questions, then suddenly darkened his face, bravely recited all the words Yukun taught him. "I was sick at home and really didn't know anything about the embarrassing things in the Meng family. However, I can report another matter to you, that is, my daughter was abducted by a relative of the Meng family more than three months ago..."

"Why didn't you..." The patrol officer eagerly asked. (223)

### Biographies in the Case of the Civet Cat

— Liutang

Li Yonghe, the younger brother of Consort Chen, according to Song Wei Tai's record, "When Empress Li entered the palace she was only ten years old, and Yonghe was only seven years old. When the Empress was about to leave, she tied a silk pouch with her hand and gave it to him, patting his back and crying: Even if you fall into decline, you must not lose this pouch. If I encounter good fortune in the future, I will definitely find you, this is my token. Later, Yonghe worked for a paper money maker and always hung the pouch on his chest. One day, he suffered from severe diarrhea and was about to die, so the paper money maker abandoned him on the side of the road. Someone from the inner courtyard saw him and took pity on him, taking him home to raise him. He was surprised that his clothes were tattered, but he had a pouch hanging on his chest, so he asked him about it, and he told him everything. The courtyard servant was shocked and surprised, because he was often ordered by the Empress to find her brother. The courtyard servant then asked in detail about his surname, given name, genealogy, and everything. He untied his pouch and showed it to the Empress the next day, and told her the whole story. At this time, the Empress was titled Consort Chen and had already given birth to Emperor Renzong. When she heard this, she was both sad and happy, so she told Emperor Zhenzong about it, and he gave him an official position."

According to this, it is a Song Dynasty notebook, and there are many places that do not match historical records. (1) The Empress at that time was not Consort Li, but Empress Liu. (2) The one who visited was Empress Liu, not Consort Li herself, and Emperor Renzong had already ascended the throne, so Empress Liu sent Liu Mei and Zhang Huaide to visit Consort Li's relatives. Wei Tai's statement that he told Emperor Zhenzong about it is a big mistake, because Emperor Zhenzong had already passed away. (3) Consort Li was titled Consort Chen, and was already critically ill. The search for Li Yonghe was at the beginning of Emperor Renzong's reign. The only thing that is the same is that history also says that Li Yonghe was poor in his youth and lived in the capital, making paper money for a living. Liu Mei sought Yonghe among the people and奏 made him an official. When Emperor Renzong knew that he was Consort Li's son, he bestowed favor on his maternal relatives and gave him the official position of military governor of Zhangxin Army, co-equal with the Chancellors, and after his death, he was given the posthumous title of Grand Tutor, Chancellor of the Central Secretariat, and Prince of Longxi. At that time, he was generally known as the Emperor's Uncle Li.
