(United Press dispatch, 2nd)

Strive for Final Victory; Complete Secure National Defense

Chongqing At the opening ceremony of the National Political Conference yesterday morning, Chairman Lin delivered an address, first praising the past achievements of the conference, and then expressing hopes for this session: (1) Spiritual unity to support unification; as long as it is beneficial to the country and the nation, everything should be sacrificed to strive for final victory; (2) The war at the front is already under control, and the construction in the rear needs more suggestions from the councilors to the government; (3) The councilors have extensive contact with various localities and overseas and should convey the actual situation to the government as much as possible, and at the same time explain the various facilities of the central government to the people, so as to infuse the emotions between the two. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek then spoke, and after describing the internal and external situations, solemnly explained the improvement of China's diplomatic situation, saying that although Japan is trying to take advantage of opportunities, friendly countries are increasing their aid to China. The unity of all countries related to the Pacific is becoming Japan's greatest panic and the greatest force for maintaining world peace. Although the European war is at risk of expansion, it is actually beneficial to China's resistance. The goal of China's resistance and construction is very simple, that is, the war must strive for the final victory, and the nation-building must achieve absolute national defense security. (All councilors applauded these two sentences.) As for the ways to achieve this, (1) In the political aspect, left-leaning and right-leaning should no longer exist. All parties and factions should take the construction of safe national defense and the defense of the country as the only goal and work together; (2) National defense construction must be industrialized for national defense and national defense for industry, and should echo and advance with military construction to improve national defense strength; (3) In the economic aspect, efforts should be made to lay the foundation for national defense, which must be absolutely safe whether in wartime or after the war; (4) Educational and cultural facilities should also be centered on and based on national defense. All citizens must reduce their personal lives to the minimum and strive to increase their public lives to the maximum. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

Chiang Kai-shek's Speech; Enthusiastic Applause from All

Chongqing At the opening ceremony of the National Political Conference yesterday morning, 189 councilors attended. Zhang Boling served as temporary chairman. Chairman of the National Government Lin Sen personally attended and delivered instructions, which was the first time since the establishment of the conference. Then, Chiang Kai-shek spoke for thirty minutes. In the middle, he stated that the goal of China's nation-building was to strive for the final victory and complete a safe national defense. His tone was particularly powerful and won enthusiastic applause from all. The councilors elected Zhou Daogang, the leader of the Sichuan army, to respond. The opening ceremony ended there. According to the agenda, the preparatory meeting should have been held next to elect the presidium, and the first plenary session should have been held in the afternoon to listen to reports on foreign affairs and economy. However, more than 40 people, including Zhang Junmai and Huang Yanpei, made a temporary motion to postpone both meetings to this morning. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

Chongqing At the first plenary session of the National Political Conference held secretly this morning, Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui and Economic Minister Weng Wenhao will give separate reports on international and economic matters. The presidium elected this morning includes Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Boling, Zhang Junmai, Zuo Shunsheng, and Ms. Wu Yifang, President of Jinling Women's College. Out of the 188 votes cast, Chiang Kai-shek received 186 votes alone. Chiang Kai-shek serves as the Chairman, and Zhang Boling serves as the Vice-Speaker, taking turns to preside over the meeting. A total of 201 representatives have registered. In addition to Mao Zedong, all Communist representatives are also included, but none of the Communist representatives attended the meetings yesterday and today. The National Political Conference is the most democratic institution in wartime China for expressing public opinion. The conference was established on July 6, 1938, when the government was still in Hankou. Four plenary sessions were held in Hankou. The first plenary session held in Chongqing was on April 10, 1940. The session of the National Political Conference was originally scheduled for October last year, before the convening of the First National Political Conference was completed. However, due to transportation difficulties and the election of the Central Executive Committee, which was not completed, the conference scheduled for November 12, 1940, was delayed. The list of the conference has also been expanded from 200 to 240 people. The names of these councilors were announced on December 23. This afternoon, Chairman Lin will host a banquet for all the councilors at the Jialing Apartments. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)

Chongqing Representatives from Shanghai, Nanjing, the three northeastern provinces, and other occupied areas are also attending the National Political Conference being held here. Representatives from Mongolia and Tibet are wearing Mongolian and Tibetan costumes. When the meeting was held last autumn, it was held in the auditorium of Chongqing University. This time, it is being held in the newly built National Assembly Hall, which can accommodate 2,200 people, so the representatives were surprised when they were taken to the venue.

### Malicious Japanese Propaganda: Chinese Troops Enter Burma

Chongqing The Japanese side has repeatedly claimed that 20,000 Chinese troops have entered Burma and that 6,000 Chinese troops have gone to Singapore, as if they had witnessed it themselves. A military spokesperson recently issued a responsible statement, saying that such malicious propaganda by the Japanese side is intended to confuse the world and is not worth a single inch. It should be known that Burma is Burma for the Burmese and is ruled by the British. Without the consent of both the central and Burmese governments, how can they arbitrarily enter Burmese territory? The British side has repeatedly stated that they are able to cope with any events in the Far East in the Malay Peninsula and Burma, so why would they need the southern assistance of the Chinese army? Therefore, the central government has long denied this, and the Japanese side has also made a public announcement, which is enough to prove that the previous rumors were unfounded. However, the Japanese are accustomed to using the technique of provocation and discord. The Chinese, British, and Burmese people should pay close attention to their intentions. (Dispatch, 2nd)

Editorial

### After the Forced Submission of France and Vietnam Again

The once extremely tense Thai-Vietnamese dispute was resolved by the Vichy government's decision at a meeting on the 28th to accept Japan's "mediation" proposal. Although the conditions have not yet been officially announced and the final result is pending negotiations in Tokyo, it is generally undoubtedly another submission by France and Vietnam. The expansion of the war between Thailand and Vietnam, which the world was worried about a few days ago, is unlikely to materialize. The Thai side, which is determined to seize territory, and Japan, which is using coercion for mediation, will both feel hesitant and satisfied with this. Only France and Vietnam, after exhausting their efforts to support themselves, finally succumbed to internal and external environments and various difficulties and had to make the tragic scene of the division of Vietnamese territory after the Hanoi Agreement last autumn. The situation faced by the French and Vietnamese authorities, who are in the midst of the storm, is indeed more serious and complicated than last autumn, but we cannot help but regret that they have failed to maintain their position from beginning to end. However, the importance of this issue does not lie in Thailand and Vietnam themselves, but in its relationship with the entire South Pacific situation. Now that the territorial dispute between the two sides has been slightly resolved, its future evolution is still uncertain. The theory of yesterday has already started, and now we invite you to give your full view.

The so-called Thai-Vietnamese territorial dispute, in essence, is only similar to the dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay in South America seven or eight years ago; but because of the complexity of the environment and background, it has formed an important part of today's crisis in the Far East, which is tightly grasped by the invaders to build a springboard for their southward invasion. If Japan cannot seize strategic strongholds on this peninsula, it is difficult to imagine that it can fight more than a thousand miles away from its rear base, regardless of whether its future main force for the southward invasion will rely on the navy, the army, or the air force. If the occupation of Hainan Island is the "19181" of the Pacific, then the directing and even "mediating" of the events from the Hanoi affair last autumn to the recent Thai-Vietnamese dispute is no different from the various aggressive arrangements on the eve of the "August 13th" incident; if there is no further hindrance and it is allowed to do whatever it wants, then when the time is right, the outbreak of future incidents in the South Pacific will be as inevitable as water flowing into a canal; how can Thailand and Vietnam be able to achieve temporary completeness because the territorial dispute is resolved! It is expected that soon, France and Vietnam will discover that their repeated submissions are only inviting more covetousness and coercion; even if the Thai side feels satisfied with the fulfillment of its territorial desires, it will eventually find that it is no different from swallowing a poisonous bait, and endless troubles will follow this "restoration movement," and finally be dragged into the South Pacific war that it has initiated and be unable to extricate itself. Thailand, Vietnam, and the relevant powers should all bear considerable responsibility for the creation of this unfortunate future; on the other hand, Japan's use of it is quite skillful. For example, for France and Vietnam, it uses its isolated and unguarded position to exert severe coercion; for the Thai side, it deliberately pleases them, even at the expense of being generous to others, exchanging Vietnamese territory for Thai goodwill; this is nothing more than expecting France and Vietnam to be unable to do anything in the end, while Thailand is approaching India and Burma. If Thailand is coerced, it will turn to unite with Britain. It is precisely because of this that they can use the tactics of picking sides to direct and control between the two countries.

However, what Japan has already completed is only a prelude to the operation of this Indochina Peninsula, and its theme is how to extract benefits from both sides as a reward, which is also an important key to completing the southward invasion steps. How this request will proceed, there are only various speculations and rumors so far, whether the conditions for asking for a reward were proposed at the beginning of the "mediation" and a tacit agreement was obtained, or whether it is to ask for a reward from both sides after the "mediation" has achieved results, there is a lack of reliable reports. However, judging from the fact that both Thailand and Vietnam have readily accepted Japan's "mediation," it seems that the latter assumption is closer to the truth. However, the so-called mediation is meritorious to Thailand, but only generates resentment to Vietnam; moreover, after more than a month of time and several twists and turns, recently France and Vietnam accepted its "proposal" in extreme reluctance and anger due to their inability to resist, then if they further ask for a reward, it can be expected that its progress will be more difficult than the mediation process, which is precisely the result that Japan will inevitably get from favoring Thailand and suppressing France and Vietnam. If no new changes occur internationally, Japan may not be able to achieve everything easily in Vietnam. There are many new and similar precedents internationally: one is Hungary and Bulgaria, which relied on the Nazis to demand land and immediately joined the Axis powers, and the other is Spain, which has received great benefits from Germany and Italy and still maintains its independent stance; will Thailand emulate Hungary and Bulgaria, or will it take France as an example in Spain? This is the touchstone of the insight and courage of the Thai authorities. Originally, its demand for land from France and Vietnam was exposing its imprudence, but now it has reached the critical juncture of the survival of the name and reality of sovereignty, so it should be able to make careful considerations.

Just a few days ago, Japan was clamoring and anxious because the Thai-Vietnamese negotiations were stranded, complaining and blaming others. From these manifestations, it is obvious that it still lacks full confidence in controlling Thailand and Vietnam; it is only because Thailand and Vietnam cannot trust and understand each other, and the relevant powers are watching from the sidelines, that Japan was able to complete the direction. With the offensive of the European invasion, the evolution of the South Pacific will soon reach an important stage, and every step of the development of the Indochina Peninsula will become every crucial prologue in it; it is hoped that all parties concerned can learn valuable lessons from the past mistakes.

### Rumor that Vichy has Accepted Japanese Mediation Terms, Ceding Five Border Areas to Thailand, Ambassador to Japan will Submit Reply

Vichy: Today's news, the Vichy government has agreed to cede provinces in Laos and Cambodia of Vietnam to Thailand, because the government has accepted the Japanese mediation plan. The plan insists on ceding the provinces in the aforementioned areas to Thailand. This decision of the French government was decided by the cabinet last night. There are five provinces to be ceded, one is the entire area of Luang Prabang and Pakse (both transliterations) in the Lao region west of the Mekong River, the entire province of Siem Reap (transliteration) in the northwest of Cambodia, most of Battambang (transliteration), and Kampong Thom (transliteration) province. (United Press, 2nd)

Hanoi: Reliable neutral sources claimed last night that fifty Japanese residents had left Hanoi for Haiphong yesterday afternoon. However, sources familiar with the matter believe that the claim by Japanese in Tokyo that Vichy has accepted the terms of Japanese mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute may be true. Most observers believe that accepting the terms is the only solution, because France's military strength is too weak to fight against the Japanese-Thai allied forces. At the same time, Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux refused to meet with local people, and other government officials remained silent and unwilling to explain. (United Press Agency, 2nd)

Berlin: The German official news agency Vichy telegram stated that French sources claimed that the French reply to the Japanese mediation proposal, transmitted by French Ambassador to Japan Henri, could be considered an approval, but there are still some points that France needs to clarify. It is said that the nature of the reply is to open the possibility of continued negotiations and to show a peaceful resolution of the dispute. (Reuters, 2nd)

Vichy: The government's attitude towards the Thai-Vietnamese dispute has been decided in principle at yesterday's State Council meeting, and a brief communiqué was issued afterwards, mentioning that semi-official sources will soon publish a document specifically explaining France's position. However, responsible officials here refuse to add anything to this. In short, the government's view before yesterday's State Council meeting was that it did not recognize that Thailand's various demands had sufficient legal basis. Although France expressed a spirit of compromise in the Tokyo negotiations, it may not have changed this legal view. (Havas, 1st)

Tokyo: Japanese semi-official sources claim that, judging from foreign news, the Vichy government's attitude towards Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute is trending towards moderation. Therefore, it is expected that French Ambassador to Japan Henri will meet with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka today. Sources familiar with the matter believe that the French reply will be more moderate than before, especially regarding the issue of returning western Cambodia. It is said that French Ambassador Henri was originally scheduled to meet with Matsuoka on March 1, but it was cancelled in order to study Vichy's instructions and request further clarification from his government. (Reuters, 2nd)

Tokyo: According to a telegram from a correspondent in Vietnam carried in yesterday's "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun," the entire French Far East Fleet returned to Saigon yesterday. According to reports, the fleet suddenly left Saigon on the 23rd of [Month missing] in an attempt to intimidate the ongoing Thai-Vietnamese peace talks. The return of the fleet to Saigon is believed to be Petain's expression of willingness to adopt a more amicable attitude towards Japan's involvement in the Thai-Vietnamese war. (Haitong Agency, 2nd)

Tokyo: The current French ambassador to Japan, Henri, met with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka for an hour today. The French ambassador seems to have explained in detail to the Japanese foreign minister the French response to the conditions for resolving the Thai-Vietnamese dispute proposed by Japan. Although Vichy news carried in yesterday's newspapers said that the French government had basically accepted the Japanese conditions, the Japanese government does not seem to have received formal notification from the French government before the French ambassador's visit to Matsuoka today. (United Press, 2nd)

Chongqing: The Central Daily News published an article stating that the permanent and satisfactory solution to the Thai-Vietnamese dispute does not depend on whether France accepts Japan's mediation proposal, but on whether Thailand and Vietnam can engage in direct negotiations without foreign interference to resolve all disputes. The United Kingdom and the United States cannot stand idly by regarding the development of South Vietnam, because once Japan's position in Thailand and Vietnam is consolidated, Japan's second step will be to attack Burma and Singapore. Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States should take action as soon as possible to avoid being too late. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Dutch East Indies Strengthens Strength to Defend Territory, Burma Restricts Steel Exports to India

New York: Associated Press News, according to General Commander Bai Beisu of the Dutch East Indies, the number of troops in the Dutch East Indies has increased several times. Previously, the troops were only concentrated in Java and Sumatra, but currently the Dutch troops have been sent to defend naval bases on the islands between Borneo and New Guinea. The future increase in troops depends on the transportation of military supplies. At present, the transportation of military supplies is very slow. The Dutch East Indies is determined to defend its territory and all its islands. (Tass, 2nd)

Rangoon: According to the newspaper's announcement, in order to preserve all steel within Burma, export licenses for steel will only be issued under very special circumstances, because countries that produce steel also have a great increase in demand for steel. The announcement stated that India is a steel-producing country, but Burma is not. Although exports to India are not currently prohibited, if Burma's steel reserves are exhausted as a result, it would not be beneficial to Burma. Therefore, merchants are advised to limit their sales to India to no more than the original pre-war quantities. (Reuters, 2nd)

Madras: A certain company in Madras, India, decided to donate 562 pounds to strengthen the defense of Singapore. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Soviet Ambassador to the United States Guarantees to the United States that Goods Shipped from the United States to the Soviet Union will not be Used for Other Countries

Washington: Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky assured Deputy Secretary of State Welles yesterday that goods shipped from the United States to the Soviet Union are being used exclusively by the Soviet Union. According to British government officials, they had previously complained to the United States that American goods were leaking into Germany from the Soviet Union, and that the Soviet Union, even if it did not directly ship American goods to Germany, was using American goods to fill the gaps. Oumansky's guarantee was issued in response to this. (United Press, 2nd)

### US Government Studies Philippine Defense Plan

Washington: Congressional leaders said yesterday that government departments are currently studying in detail the plan to defend the Philippine Islands. The authorities are paying particular attention to protecting residents as much as possible when attacked, including food, shelter, and fire prevention issues. Although the White House and the Budget Office have not yet approved the plan, it is expected that action will be taken soon. (United Press, 2nd)

At the same time, the US Navy can also have 15,000 aircraft of various types. (Havas, 2nd)

### The Balkan Situation is Seriously Deteriorating, German Land and Air Forces Pour into Bulgaria, UK May Announce Severance of Relations with Bulgaria, Bulgarian Ambassador to the UK has Resigned

London: Rome Radio news said that with the full consent of the Bulgarian government, German troops will enter Bulgaria today. This is the first time the Axis powers have publicly admitted that German troops intend to enter Bulgaria. (Reuters, 2nd)

Sofia: A British embassy spokesperson announced last night that due to the German military's expansion into Bulgaria, the UK's severance of relations with Bulgaria is only a matter of hours. According to news from London, the British government has empowered the ambassador to Bulgaria, Rendel, to assess the situation and sever relations with Bulgaria at any time. British Ambassador Rendel is scheduled to meet with Bulgarian King Boris after church service today to sever diplomatic relations, which is only one step away from declaring war between the two countries. When this step will be implemented is still subject to instructions from London. (United Press, 2nd)

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent announced today that the Bulgarian ambassador to the UK, Momtchiloff, has telegraphed the Bulgarian government to resign. (Reuters, 2nd)

Southern Capital City: According to news from the Bulgarian capital, 250 German aircraft flew over the area yesterday. It is heard that various airfields in southern Bulgaria have fallen into the hands of the Germans, and German dive bombers have arrived there. (Reuters, 2nd)

Bulgarian Capital: German army corps strengthened their control over major parts of Bulgaria this morning. German engineers are installing coastal artillery in Varna, intending to bombard British ships entering the Dardanelles. German officers and technicians occupied private houses and villas, while troops were stationed in schools and town halls. The Bulgarian capital has been officially declared a demilitarized city. No one is allowed to leave the city without a pass. The German headquarters are located forty miles southeast of the city. The Bulgarian capital has imposed a strict blackout order. The German military has complete control over radio stations, railways, highways, docks, etc. Large German armies are moving along the coast, apparently establishing a major outpost on the Black Sea border of neighboring countries. (International News, 2nd)

Yugoslav Capital City: The "Politika" recently carried a telegram from a correspondent stationed in the Bulgarian capital stating that 250 German aircraft landed at the Bulgarian capital's airfield this morning. German motorized units also arrived in the Bulgarian capital at 5 PM today. In addition, German troops have been seen in cities such as Varna, Vidin, and Ruse in Bulgaria. (Havas, 1st)

Bulgarian Capital: Fully armed German troops, ready for war, controlled Sofia last night. They entered various parts of Bulgaria on armored trains, trains, and troop carriers, apparently heading towards the northeastern border of Greece. Knowing that Bulgaria had joined the Axis pact in the Vienna Conference two hours ago, helmeted German troops entered the Bulgarian capital in armored vehicles. Yesterday, the skies over the Bulgarian capital were filled with German aircraft. When the Brownshirts crossed the bridges across the Danube from Romania to Bulgaria, they were escorted by large numbers of German bombers and fighters. The Bulgarian government was quite alarmed. The crowds on the streets of the Bulgarian capital watched silently as the German troops paraded by. The speed of the German troops' entry into Bulgaria exceeded their expectations. Senior officials have been hotly speculating as to whether the German troops will immediately attack Greece or simply deploy in Bulgaria, but because the general direction of the German troops is towards the Greek border, the theory that they will soon attack Greece seems more reasonable. (International News, 1st)

German Influence Extends into the Balkans, Attempting to Facilitate a Ceasefire between Italy and Greece

Yugoslav Capital City: Since the Bulgarian situation unfolded, diplomatic circles here have predicted that Germany will issue an ultimatum to Yugoslavia. It is believed that the Germans, who have already occupied Bulgaria, will not attack Greece for the time being before attempting to use Yugoslavia to mediate the Greek-Italian war. Political circles here all believe that Greece's rejection of the Axis powers' proposed conditions for resolving the Greek-Italian war will inevitably lead to Germany's blitzkrieg advancing to the Thessaloniki area. Most diplomats believe that Yugoslavia can no longer safely remain outside the Axis powers. (International News Agency, 2nd)

Vichy: According to observations from foreign diplomatic circles, Bulgaria's joining of the Tripartite Pact at a time when the Balkan situation is critical will be regarded by the Axis powers as a response to the recent talks between the United Kingdom and Turkey in Ankara. As for the claim that German troops have arrived in the Bulgarian capital, although it has not been officially confirmed, it is a natural result of Bulgaria joining the Tripartite Pact, because at this moment the Axis powers are actually expanding their first line of defense as much as possible. In addition, it can be asserted that if the United Kingdom or Turkey take any aggressive actions, the Axis powers will immediately respond. For example, if British troops land in Greece, Germany will definitely take action. The intention is nothing more than to warn the United Kingdom not to interfere in the Balkan Peninsula war. In short, Greece is now isolated. As a result of the current situation's evolution, that country will have to give greater consideration to the proposal for a separate peace with Italy, which is not necessarily impossible. (Havas, 1st)

Germany Completes Military Deployment, Possibly a Prelude to Aiding Italy in Attacking Greece

Vichy: After the German troops entered Bulgaria, observers here generally believe that this move may not immediately produce any military consequences. In particular, the border area between Bulgaria and Greece is not only mostly mountainous, but also is located north of the Greek port of Thessaloniki. After the German troops arrive on the Bulgarian border, they will have a commanding position, which will inevitably have a significant impact on future military operations. Since the United Kingdom has won successive victories in Africa, its military position on the Aegean coast has also gained an advantage as a result. However, it will be difficult to maintain this advantage in the future, because until the end of the month, the British troops' target in the Balkans was only the Italian army, which was travelling far by sea and threatened by the British fleet. In the future, they will have to confront the German army directly. According to estimates by The Times of London, the entire strength of the German army is no less than 225 divisions, of which 13 are armored divisions and 10 are motorized units. There are 500,000 officers in the Lower Danube region. Although these troops are scattered in Romania and Bulgaria, resulting in long transportation lines, their defenses are far from the coast, so they can be free from the trouble of the British fleet. This is probably another reason why German troops can operate more easily than Italian troops. (Havas, 2nd)

Yugoslavia is Isolated, Germany Implements Terror Tactics against Yugoslavia

Yugoslav Capital City: The Germans are currently adopting terror tactics against Yugoslavia. Today, German bombers flew over the area of Skopje, but one of them was forced to land by Yugoslav fighters. Seven German aircraft also violated Yugoslav territory opposite Gevgelija. Yugoslav guards opened fire with machine guns, forcing them to retreat towards Romania. Yugoslavia has deployed anti-aircraft artillery positions at important locations in the Danube region. (Reuters, 2nd)

Vienna: After Bulgaria joined the Tripartite Pact, people generally worry that the country will actively assist the Axis powers. However, some political observers here believe that the country may not immediately implement the pact, because Article 3 of the pact stipulates that other signatory countries will only provide assistance if one signatory country is subjected to "attack by countries that are not currently at war." Since the United Kingdom is already a belligerent country, this clause cannot be applied according to legal principles. Therefore, the so-called mutual assistance treaty must wait until Turkey takes aggressive action before it can be invoked. However, most observers do not believe that Turkey will take any sudden action and strongly assert that the country's diplomatic activities have historically been inclined towards peace rather than war. On this basis, the importance of the Tripartite Pact lies not in its theoretical application, but in its spiritual influence. As for Bulgaria, its joining the pact is nothing less than declaring that it will abandon its consistent policy of refusing to participate in any pact and cautiously making friends with all countries. Looking at the Balkan Peninsula today, Yugoslavia is the only country that has not entered into any treaty relationship with the belligerent countries. However, it is questionable whether this isolated attitude can be maintained for a long time. (Havas, 1st)

If Turkey's Security is Threatened, it is Prepared to Fight Shoulder to Shoulder with the UK

Ankara: The news of the German troops entering Bulgaria has sent shockwaves through Ankara. A Turkish government spokesperson said yesterday that if war breaks out in the Balkans as a result and Turkey's security is threatened, then Turkey may be forced to fight shoulder to shoulder with the UK. This statement was made after British Foreign Secretary Eden and Chief of Staff Dill left Turkey, and after Eden and Dill had agreed with Turkish leaders on a joint political, diplomatic, and military plan, they departed from Turkey for Cairo. (International News Agency, 2nd)

Ankara: There is not much surprise here about Bulgaria's participation in the Tripartite Pact, and it is regarded as Germany's response to British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to Ankara. The Turkish cabinet convened a meeting to review the results of Eden's visit. (Reuters, 2nd)

Istanbul: It is heard that the Turkish naval authorities have issued an order that all ships intending to pass through the Dardanelles Strait must report their identities to the authorities in the future and request the assignment of a pilot. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Supreme Soviet Declares Closing, Passes National Defense Budget and Important Bills

Moscow – The eighth session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union concluded successfully on March 1st. The Chairman of the People’s Committee of Finance of the Soviet Union, Zverev, delivered a speech on behalf of the People’s Committee, stating that the Soviet government agreed to the proposed amendments to the 1941 budget by the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities. It was decided to increase revenue by 990 million rubles and expenditures by 17.3 million rubles. Zverev continued, saying that the People’s Committee of the Soviet Union believed that the proposals of the delegates to increase economic and cultural expenditures in various states and regions should be immediately approved. An additional 6.6 million rubles should be allocated for industrial construction in Latvia, 1.5 million rubles for municipal construction in Tashkent, and construction funds for Ukraine, Armenia, and other states. After the above amendments, Zverev proposed approving the 1941 Soviet budget, with estimated revenue of 216,840,224,000 rubles and expenditures of 216,520,134,000 rubles, including 70,865,000,000 rubles for the Red Army and Navy.

The two houses voted in succession, and the budget was unanimously approved. At this point, everyone stood up and cheered. When the national defense budget was passed, everyone applauded even more enthusiastically. In addition to approving the 1941 budget, the following items were also approved at the meeting: (1) the Collective Farm Income Tax Law and amendments to agricultural taxes; (2) an amendment to several articles of the Soviet Constitution regarding the renaming of the Aikemen district to the Isimo district; (3) the establishment of the People's State Management Committee; (4) the division of the People's Internal Affairs Committee into two departments; (5) the decrees promulgated by the Presidium since the seventh session of the Supreme Soviet.

### Japan Coerces Vietnam to Cede Land with Threatening Posture; Guarantee of Territorial Integrity Is Empty Words; Thailand Invites the Wolf into the House, Future Is Worrying; Renowned Commentator Woodhead Writes an Article Discussing This

Renowned commentator Woodhead published an article in the English-language Greater American Weekly yesterday, commenting on Japan's handling of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, stating that the attention of people in the Far East has been entirely focused on the Thai-Vietnamese dispute and Japan's mediation over the past week. Japan is forcing Vietnam to cede land to Thailand at any cost, even proposing conditions that Vichy cannot accept, setting a deadline for a reply, and ordering Japanese residents in Vietnam to prepare to evacuate, while amassing large numbers of land and naval forces near Vietnam. Under these circumstances, Vietnam can only be forced to accept Japan's proposals. This kind of power politics is already commonplace in Europe. Therefore, there is no need to be surprised if the third axis follows the old tricks of Hitler and Mussolini. If we are not forgetful, we should recall that a few months ago, Japan guaranteed to Vietnam that it would respect the territorial integrity of Vietnam. Recently, Japanese politicians have repeatedly stated that Japan has no intention of using force anywhere in East Asia. Such remarks are not surprising, because any Axis country must make such remarks before engaging in aggression. Thailand takes advantage of the situation and relies on the assistance of other countries to engage in aggression, thinking it is a good plan, but does not realize that it has already been incorporated into the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." It has invited the wolf into the house. Although it has gained some land, it has already lost something more important. One does not need to be a wise man to know what has been gained and lost. Is Thailand the Bulgaria of the Far East?

Economic Constraints Faced by Vietnam

Renowned economic commentator A. Arlander published an article in the English-language Greater American Weekly yesterday, commenting on Japan's economic advance into the South, stating that Japan hopes that countries in East Asia can voluntarily participate in its so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." However, after witnessing the Sino-Vietnamese and Sino-Dutch economic negotiations, various countries have a good understanding of the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and lack enthusiasm for voluntary participation. When Japan negotiated with Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies, it made it clear that it had no intention of implementing the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and its purpose was only to obtain unilateral benefits without offering any goods in exchange.

Applying Political and Military Pressure Simultaneously

At the same time, in order to force Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies to accept its demands, it spared no effort in using political and military pressure. When Vietnam negotiated with Japan, Japanese troops had already invaded, and Japanese warships were patrolling along the coast and the lower reaches of the Mekong River, so its situation was not as good as that of the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch East Indies is still outside the sphere of Japanese influence, and its defense is more solid. Therefore, it can adhere to certain principles when conducting economic negotiations with Japan.

Vietnam Yields and Is at Its Mercy

Vietnam's situation is different; it is almost entirely at Japan's mercy. Nineteen out of twenty major demands made by the Japanese have already been accepted. As evidenced by the economic agreement established between Vietnam and Japan in East Asia on January 20, Vietnam has made every effort to satisfy Japan economically. Japan has the right to prioritize the most important economic resources of Vietnam. According to recent news from Saigon, Vietnam will supply Japan with 700,000 tons of rice this year (accounting for one-third of Japan's foreign rice imports), and 15,000 tons of rubber (accounting for one-third of Vietnam's rubber exports and one-half of Japan's import needs). In addition, Vietnam will also supply Japan with large quantities of corn, coal, phosphorus, and limestone.

Fulfilling Obligations by Restricting Exports

In order to fulfill its obligations to Japan, Vietnam has adopted many special measures. For example, since last month, Saigon rice exports have been subject to export bans, and except for those transported to Japan and France, they may not be transported to other places (except for those previously scheduled). At the same time, a special export agency was organized, adopting a quota system and a licensing system to control foreign trade, such as restricting rubber exports. Although Vietnam tries its best to satisfy Japan with the items transported to Japan, it intends to imitate Japan's organization and establish an import agency to control the items Japan transports to Vietnam. However, Japan expressed great dissatisfaction, and Japanese newspapers criticized it extensively, believing that Vietnam intended to undermine the economic agreement established on January 20.

Vietnam Has Gained Nothing

The purpose of Japan's move is to pressure Vietnam to allow Japanese goods to enter. It is not that Vietnam does not need Japanese goods. When Vietnam and Japan negotiated in Tokyo, Vietnam notified Japan that it hoped that Japan could supply it with the items it needed, such as hardware, chemicals, medicines, and dyes. At that time, Japan promised. Today, Vietnam has accepted its demands, but Japan has not fulfilled its promises and has supplied Vietnam with textiles and toys that Vietnam does not need.

### Saigon Grain Supplied to Japan in Large Quantities

When both parties were conducting these negotiations in Hanoi and Tokyo, the Japanese side could not wait to pressure the French side to fulfill its unilateral obligations in accordance with the agreement established in January. At present, Saigon rice has been transported to Japan in large quantities, and rubber will soon be transported there as well. After witnessing the suffering of Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies felt sympathetic and could not remain indifferent. Under the oil agreement established last year, the Dutch East Indies has been particularly generous to Japan, supplying it with one-third of its oil production.

Dutch East Indies Not Afraid of Any Threats

According to last year's agreement, part of the oil production is exchanged for goods. Japan is greedy and insatiable, and recently hoped that the Dutch East Indies would supply it with more oil. The Dutch East Indies replied, "Please pay in cash." The main issue in the negotiations held in the capital of the Dutch East Indies is this. The Japanese economic delegation sent to the Dutch East Indies for the second time was not as well-prepared as the first time. Japan's purpose seems to be to use threats and intimidation to force the Dutch East Indies to follow in Vietnam's footsteps and establish the same unilateral commercial agreement. The Dutch East Indies is not unwilling to accept reasonable demands, but it is not without options and has no defeatist sentiments. Therefore, it will be difficult to achieve results by trying to threaten the Dutch East Indies in the same way as it threatened Vietnam.

### Electricity Supply in French Concession Temporarily Not Restricted, Because Generators Use Fuel Oil Instead of Coal; Situation Can Obtain Safe Supply if There Are No Changes

The Times reported that the Public Concession may reduce electricity supply to industries such as textiles and machinery due to the failure to obtain sufficient coal storage. However, on the French Concession side, there has been a temporary guarantee that there is no such emergency, at least not before now.

French Company Uses Fuel Oil

The manager of Shanghai French Electricity Company, Fafle, said yesterday morning (1st) that the company's power generation equipment all uses fuel oil instead of coal, and a safe supply can be obtained in the near future. However, he also warned about the delicate situation, which could cause changes at any moment.

If Supply Fails, Other Plans Will Be Made

According to preliminary estimates, the textile and machinery industries will be most severely affected by the reduction in electricity supply in the Public Concession, and Chinese factories that are currently operating at maximum capacity may be the first to be affected. The resulting unemployment is of course a topic that the committee should consider. However, factories and the public in the French Concession still have the freedom to use electricity because Fafle has made a clear guarantee. If there is an unforeseeable event in the situation, then other plans will have to be made.

Oil Supply Comes from Dutch East Indies

Because the supply of fuel oil in this city all depends on the Dutch East Indies, the reason for Fafle's reserved restriction is obviously the volatile situation in the South Pacific. As for the power generation of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, most of it relies on coal. Some equipment has recently been reformed to use fuel oil, but it accounts for less than 20% of all equipment. However, once something happens in the South Seas, the supply of fuel oil will face the same difficulties as coal, because the belligerent countries will definitely concentrate on sinking oil tankers.

### Western Chamber of Commerce Asks United States Line to Open Hong Kong-Shanghai Air Route, Extending the Hong Kong Route to Shanghai

The Shanghai Western Chamber of Commerce has decided to ask United States Lines to extend the Hong Kong route to Shanghai in order to promote commerce and benefit foreign residents. It is reported that United States Lines has considered it, because Shanghai merchants have been affected by the war, and shipping schedules are uncertain, causing airmail sent from Shanghai to not be able to catch ships to transport it to Hong Kong to be attached to the Clipper ship to the United States. Therefore, they requested the opening of the Hong Kong-Shanghai air route. The company is also planning to extend the Hong Kong-Philippines route to Singapore and believes that this plan is even more important than the Hong Kong-Shanghai route. Therefore, it decided to open the Singapore route first, and then open the Hong Kong-Shanghai route.

### Sufficient Food Reserves for Shanghai Residents; Urgent Need to Suppress Hoarding; Over 500,000 Quintals of Foreign Rice Shipped to Shanghai in January; Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee Rescheduled to Meet Today

Foreign Sources of Foreign Rice Never Interrupted Regarding the amount of rice shipped to Shanghai in January, the Jianghai Customs has just completed the statistics, and a summary is provided below. The total amount is 501,733 quintals, worth 3,528,318 gold units, equivalent to a national currency value of 9,551,186.076. The third largest is Siam, with 66,862 quintals, and other places account for 2,513 quintals. This foreign rice can supply the city's food needs for more than a month, so the abundance of the city's food reserves can be imagined. However, because these reserves are monopolized and hoarded by speculative rice merchants and non-industry speculators, market trading has reached a situation where there are markets but no goods. The only important thing now is to suppress hoarding and encourage the procurement of food. Anyone who tries to hoard in the market should be severely punished in accordance with the law, otherwise the rice reserves will be manipulated.

However, yesterday was a Sunday, and the authorities were closed for the usual holiday, so they could not send representatives to attend. Now, for the sake of prudence, it has been rescheduled to convene the evaluation committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. today at the association hall on the third floor of No. 15, Edward Road. It is reported that the meeting will discuss (1) How to deal with the intentional increase in rice prices by foreign rice trading companies, which has increased the costs of the same industry; (2) Whether the price limit for foreign rice should be lowered again.

20,000 Bags of Tribute Rice Arrive Today

According to a revelation from the rice industry yesterday, the Pluto ship of Baolong Foreign Company, a Portuguese company, is expected to arrive in port from Saigon this afternoon. The ship is loaded with 20,000 bags of tribute rice and will be docked at pontoons 23 and 24 in the Huangpu River. As soon as unloading is completed, it will continue to export and load foreign rice to Shanghai. According to a rice industry committee member, there will be no interruption in the source of foreign rice. Last week, the number of foreign rice shipments to Shanghai was not as abundant as in previous weeks due to a slight reduction in foreign flights. Now, everything has been arranged gradually, and the number of ships carrying rice will increase. Therefore, it is expected that the source of foreign rice will be abundant. At the same time, various foreign companies in the city have been entrusted by legitimate rice merchants to order foreign rice by telegram so that they can continuously load ships to Shanghai.

Today is Friends Day

### Originator Huang Jingwan Encourages Friendship and Composes a Folk Song with Profound Meaning

Today marks the seventh anniversary of the March 3rd Friends Day. The originator, Huang Jingwan, issued a declaration yesterday, stating that the most important thing in life is friendship. However, there are good and bad friends. Good friends encourage each other to overcome bad habits and make gradual progress, learn to be good people, and reverse the declining trends. Having lived in the world for thirty years, and witnessing the decline of friendship and the treacherousness of people's hearts, I initiated Friends Day seven years ago to emphasize the promotion of friendship. This year, on this day, we still face severe national crisis and a fierce European war. Countless friends are suffering. Due to the special circumstances, we cannot hold commemorative ceremonies or private banquets to celebrate. Therefore, I am issuing a declaration on this day to encourage friends at home and abroad to self-reflect. Every year on this day, I strive in various ways to inspire interest in friendship, awaken the psychology of friends loving groups and the world, and awaken the world's attention to the welfare of friends as the purpose. In other words, the purpose of Friends Day is to enhance the friendship between men and women, cultivate noble and pure personalities, foster a spirit of universal love and mutual assistance, realize the important mission of life, and then strive for one's position, improve virtue, study diligently, and become great assets to society and the nation. At the same time, it also calls on public opinion to pay attention to friendship, love people, and at all times and in all places, do its best to support social welfare undertakings (such as poverty relief, disaster relief, caring for children, and respecting the elderly, etc.). In short, it is hoped that all ethnic groups will not infringe on each other, but cooperate and assist each other, coexist and prosper together, and be able to deeply understand and practice, and seek the revitalization of humanity.

Folk Song

Mr. Huang recently composed a folk song for Friends Day amidst his busy schedule, which is recorded as follows: "Winter goes and spring comes quickly, young men and women, don't waste your youth. Making good friends brings smiles, encountering bad friends brings frowns. It's not just about academic inferiority, but a lack of character and trustworthiness. Usually, treating people may be too casual, but don't throw away morality. Cultivate your mind and nature peacefully, believe in optimism and write poetry. If you encounter difficulties, help each other. A noble personality is known far and wide. Working diligently brings happiness, old and young, men and women, take what you need. Faithfulness, righteousness, courtesy, and harmony are the virtues of friendship. Sharing joy is like the full moon, a helpful friend is better than gold. May you cherish the good spring, I offer this folk song to you. Don't forget the March 3rd Friends Day."

### Xin Puyu Hall Continues to Receive Donations

Some have even saved on banquet expenses and donated the money intended for birthday celebrations.

### Kidnapping of a Child Sentences Defendant to a Year and a Half in Prison

Shuyou, the five-year-old son of He Yurong, a native of Yangzhou residing in a bungalow in Caoxiebang, Gordon Road, was playing near his doorstep at 7:30 AM on the 24th, when he was lured away by Wang Xiaosanzi, a native of Jiangbei. Wang Xiaosanzi enticed the boy by saying he was taking him to play somewhere and offering him a beautiful pencil. The child, unaware of Wang's ill intentions, followed him to the entrance of Caoxiebang. There, Dai Xiaomei, the wife of the child's neighbor Shen A'er, spotted them. Dai remembered that her sister, Hongwen (age 7), had been lured away by Wang Xiaosanzi last winter but was later found and brought back. She immediately cried for help and apprehended Wang, taking him to the Putuo Road Police Station and handing him over to the Special Court for investigation. Recently, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial. Jiang Baolian, the police station's lawyer, requested a severe punishment. The defendant confessed that he had previously worked at a certain yarn factory but had recently lost money gambling. He resorted to this desperate measure and begged for leniency. Judge Huang sentenced Wang Xiaosanzi to one year and six months in prison as a warning, and the pencil was confiscated.

### Social News

Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, the Putuo Road Police Station received a tip-off that two notorious robbers and assassins, Chen Zhaoying and Tang Jinlong, who were previously wanted by the two concessions, have recently been active in the concessions again. The station ordered Chinese Detective Feng Baishun, Chinese Detectives Kong Guangxiao, Wang Yongjun, Pi Shaozhang, Detective Gu Yinxuan, etc., to disguise themselves and lie in wait at the intersection of Hubei Road and Guangdong Road. After a while, the two robbers were seen staggering along. Without making a sound, the detectives stepped forward, apprehended them, and took them to the police station, where they will be transferred to the Special First Court for investigation today.

Some businesses act as agents for pawning goods and even accept pawn tickets as collateral for cash. Their exorbitant interest rates exploit the poor to an extreme degree. The largest number of such shops is in West Shanghai, where they have been springing up like mushrooms after rain. However, due to the impending establishment of the "West Shanghai Special Police Station," this type of business is subject to suppression. They are already relocating to the Xujiahui and Zhaojiabang areas, where there are over fifty such establishments. When will the harm they inflict on society finally be eradicated?

Yesterday morning at 6:50 AM, three robbers suddenly broke into a house on 544 Baker Road, Public Concession.

It is reported that after the sudden crackdown on gambling dens of all sizes in the Nanshi area on the 18th of last month, all of them temporarily closed. It is now said that the owners of the gambling dens have sought powerful individuals to intercede with all parties, and there is a possibility of a resurgence. It is expected that they will all reopen around the 6th or 7th of this month. Therefore, since yesterday, the gambling dens have been renovating their premises.

### North-West YMCA Displays Formidable Momentum; Tung Wah Fought to a Draw Yesterday; Recovered a Goal; Still Hope for the A League Championship

Yesterday, the focus was on the A League football match between Tung Wah and North-West YMCA, which ended in a 1-1 draw. In the first half, North-West YMCA led 1-0. In the second half, Tung Wah returned a goal, resulting in a draw. Tung Wah's hopes for the A League championship are not extinguished yet. In the future, everything will depend on the final battle against West Police. If West Police cannot defeat Tung Wah again, Tung Wah will have a hard time winning the championship. If Tung Wah wins the next two matches, it can still win the title. Yesterday, there were about 7,000 fans at the Canidrome. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

Tung Wah

Qin Bigao, He Jiatong, Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Huang Kehou, Han Longhai, Wan Jin, Dai Linjing, Li Yichen, Fei Chunhua, Jia Youliang

North-West YMCA

Snichung, Paul, Rugen, Cairo, Lialio, Glevife, Dingel, Te, Nick, Kocklan, Katepei, Tauberlinki

An Unfavorable Start Results in Conceding a Goal

Yesterday, Tung Wah changed Li Yichen to lead the central attack, with Aja playing on the left wing. As a result, the performance was not good. In the second half, Huang Kehou was substituted, and Li Yichen retreated to center back. The situation improved significantly, demonstrating the significant impact of a single adjustment. North-West YMCA had a strong attack yesterday, but unfortunately, they failed to score multiple times. North-West YMCA kicked off first. As soon as the battle began, the ball went to Tung Wah's feet. Aja darted forward several times, passing the ball horizontally to Wan Jin, who swept it along the ground. Snichung caught it directly. Dingel cut in, lacking support. Aja made a high pass, and Li Yi laid it off. Dai Lin made a sharp angled shot. Dingel made a forceful kick along the touchline, which was swift and fierce. Qin Bigao saved the dangerous situation.

The situation became a stalemate. After 35 minutes, Dingel charged up like a raging horse, making a quick pass to the center. Kocklan took advantage of the opportunity to make a sliding shot, hitting the upper right corner, making it 1-0. North-West YMCA took the lead. The first half ended like this.

Changing the Formation to Achieve a Draw

After the lemon break, Tung Wah deployed troops and arranged a new formation. Zhuang Youren was moved to the left side, Han Longhai to the right back, He Jiatong to left winger, Liang Shutang to the right side. Little Fei and Aja had already been rotated in the forward line. At this time, Li Yi was moved to center back, and Huang Kehou replaced him in the front line. The formation took on a brand new look.

On the North-West YMCA side, the two inside forwards also swapped positions. Tung Wah's luck was extremely poor, making it impossible to make a comeback. Aja, Dai, Little Fei, Little Wan, and Huang Kehou all took a series of shots, but either missed or went too high. Half an hour passed again. After a dangerous shot from Kocklan, Tung Wah launched a desperate counterattack. Li Yi intercepted the ball from the midfield, made a long pass to Aja, and Aja charged forward fiercely, passing Rugen and Paul, and crossed the ball to the center. The landing point was less than five yards from the goal. Little Wan Jin was waiting on the side, lightly touching the ball, and Snichung was caught off guard. The ball flew straight into the net, and the whole stadium erupted with firecrackers. Tung Wah was fortunate enough to avoid defeat with a 1-1 draw.

On the Yousheng side, they had solid kicking skills and entered the field with a strong presence. After the match began, both sides had their own attacks and defenses, and they remained stalemated for 15 minutes.

### Children's Library: Recruitment Team Leaders' Meeting Yesterday Resolved to Intensify Recruitment to Achieve Goals; Revised Donation Reward and Commemoration Measures

The Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee held a reception for recruitment team leaders at noon yesterday. Over a hundred people attended, including Yuan Ludeng, Chen Qingshi, Hu Zuyin, Huang Yantang, and Lin Chongzhi. The meeting was chaired by Yuan Ludeng, the head of the recruitment team. During the meeting, Yuan Ludeng delivered a speech, stating: "Today, the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee is holding a reception for team leaders. I, as the head of the recruitment team, would like to say a few words on behalf of the entire Preparatory Committee. First, on behalf of the entire Preparatory Committee, I extend a warm welcome to all of you. Despite your busy schedules, you have still found time to raise funds for the Children's Library. Your enthusiasm is truly admirable. You are the benefactors of the children of Shanghai. I should also express my gratitude to you on behalf of the children of Shanghai. Second, preparing the funding for the Children's Library is not an easy task. Although the amount of 50,000 yuan is not very large, it is indeed difficult to raise this amount given the current high cost of living. Therefore, I want to encourage everyone not to underestimate this task. At the same time, do not be discouraged if you encounter obstacles during the process. Finally, we have a saying in China, 'Where there's a will, there's a way.' I firmly believe that as long as everyone works hard, we will surely achieve satisfactory results. I wish you all a smooth recruitment process and look forward to the early completion of the Children's Library." Chen Qingshi, the chief strategist, then spoke, elaborating on the importance of establishing a Children's Library and reporting that the Public Works Department is also preparing to establish a small-scale Children's Library within the Northern District Elementary School on Connaught Road to enhance children's welfare. This can be complementary. Hu Zuyin, representing the Standing Committee, reported on the progress of the preparation. Ding Bingnan, the deputy secretary, reported on the fundraising situation. Huang Jingwan, Zhang Zupei, Li Shanzhan, Liang Zhongyuan, Su Luxiang, and others spoke successively, contributing their opinions. After the chairman summarized the results: (1) It was agreed to request all major primary and secondary schools in the city to universally organize recruitment teams to assist in fundraising. (2) It was agreed to request all newspapers to promote the cause of children's welfare as much as possible. (3) Fundraising efforts should be intensified to complete the fundraising target before this year's Children's Day. (4) The revised reward measures for enthusiastic donors are as follows: (1) Those who donate one dime or more will receive a commemorative badge. (2) Those who donate one yuan or more will receive a specially made commemorative badge. (3) Those who donate five yuan or more will receive a bronze commemorative badge. (4) Those who donate fifty yuan or more will receive a silver commemorative badge. (5) Those who donate one hundred yuan or more will receive a banner. (6) Those who donate five hundred yuan or more will receive a plaque. (7) Those who donate one thousand yuan or more will receive a plaque and have their photograph displayed for permanent commemoration.

Suggesting Fundraising on March 8th

Madam Qin Shuluan, the wife of Mr. Ying Yongwang, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee, suggested that since the March 8th Women's Day coincides with the period of fundraising for the Children's Library, and considering the close relationship between women and children, she sent a letter to the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) yesterday, initiating a fundraising campaign for the Children's Library Committee on March 8th.

### Natural Gasoline in the Soviet Union by Xu Boxiao

This article was originally written by U. Boksierman, the Director and Engineer of the Gas Directorate under the People's Committee of Petroleum of the Soviet Union, and published in the Izvestia newspaper in Moscow on January 3rd.  ——Transliteration

Natural gasoline, measured by its highest calorific value (8,000 calories per cubic Russian yard, a unit of heat) and chemical composition, is not only an excellent fuel for industrial enterprises and cities, but also a valuable product, a high-grade volatile oil, and a raw material for the production of soot and other similar products derived from gasoline. Therefore, the capitalist countries consider natural gasoline as an industry that should be widely developed during the Second World War, especially the United States.

In the United States, the extraction of natural gasoline in 1939 was 62.26 billion cubic Russian yards. In 1938, the industrial enterprises accounted for 79% of the total extraction of natural gasoline, and the needs of life accounted for 16%. At the end of 1938, the number of gasoline wells reached 53,000.

The United States has the longest gasoline transportation network, with a total distance (main line distribution) of 300,000 kilometers in 1938. Among them, the annual production of gasoline was 1.8 trillion cubic Russian yards. Specifically, in 1939, the high-quality volatile oil produced from natural gasoline accounted for 5.5 million tons, and the number of gas plants reached 620 in 1940.

The United States has greatly expanded its business of burning petroleum into liquid gas. Its sales volume in 1939 was about 90 million liters, an increase of 36% compared to 1938. From 1929 to 1939 (a total of ten years), the demand for liquid gas in the United States increased as high as 90 times. Liquid gas has a high calorific value of 100 and is suitable to replace volatile oil for automatic transportation or propulsion and life needs. The investment in the gasoline industry in the United States is 49.8 billion US dollars, of which the natural gasoline industry accounts for 26.7 billion US dollars. This is a larger investment than other industries: such as the automobile industry, which is 13 billion US dollars, and the steel casting industry, which is 400 million US dollars. The production of soot reached more than 238,000 tons in 1939.

The Soviet Union's estimated reserves of natural gasoline are roughly equivalent to those of the United States. However, due to insufficient exploration and equipment in its production areas, the 18th plenary session of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union listed it as a major agenda item, deciding to expand the acquisition of gasoline benefits from petroleum, clean up gasoline production areas, and underground coal gasification, which should be increased by three and a half times in the third five-year plan.

The output of natural gasoline must be increased by two times in 1942. The basic work in the past two years is to pay attention to the needs of different petroleum regions in the Soviet Union, estimate the development of production, and transform petroleum into gasoline.

The Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union soon promulgated a decree on the development of petroleum gasoline utilization and volatile oil production. This decision is the procedure for the petroleum industry workers to follow.

The natural gasoline industry is one of the seedlings in the Soviet Union's national economy. It has been composed or is currently being composed in the Stalin year of the five-year plan (i.e., this year). The extraction of gasoline in the Azerbaidzanskaja petroleum industry has increased more than ten times compared to 1913.

In 1940, the improvement of the gasoline economic work of the People's Committee of the Soviet Union Petroleum Industry has been achieved. Since July, the gasoline extraction plan has been practically exceeded and its application has been improved. Although there was little improvement in the extraction and application of gasoline before this, the only problem lies in sorting out the loss of gasoline and volatile oil.

The consumption of gasoline in the petroleum business is still very large. The basic reason is the lack of a secret system for the construction of gasoline production areas (the organization of refining from petroleum well openings to oil storage ponds) and the stagnation of the work of acquiring gasoline in new oil wells and new petroleum area gasoline areas.

There are still soil blocks, gasoline consumption, and evaporation fractionation issues in the petroleum business. The first thing to do is to eliminate these soil blocks, so it is necessary to first improve the construction of oil ponds and gasoline pumps for spraying oil, as well as pressers, and replace the petroleum pressing extraction method with the air-pressure oil suction method.

The Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union decided to stipulate the procedures for business and secret construction work from 1941 to 1942. This work must be fully achieved in the basic oil areas of the Soviet Union, such as Baku, Mayangba, Ishimbaya, and Pukoroslana, in the past two years. The largest work of gasoline storage ponds and transportation must be laid in Kazakhastan, Turkemen, and Birikam.

The secret construction work is first the Azov Petroleum Company's General Toras, and the first phase is given significant work. The "Stalin," "Kaganovich," and "Azizbek" petroleum companies have built stone and iron petroleum storage rooms, refineries, and pipe cylinders. There are hundreds of well exchange open warehouses, and seven air-converted gasoline pressing stations. The development of its volatile oil, compared to 1938, has increased by 6 to 7 per thousand for Surakha Petroleum, 7 to 10 per thousand for Karachukhor Petroleum, and more than 1 percent for Bodin Petroleum.

The Azirbayen Company, together with the Party organs, resolutely extracts petroleum, and uses air pressure to extract gasoline at a rate of more than 100 tons per day and night. Other petroleum extraction Toras extracts 20 to 30 tons. Therefore, the "Kirov," "Kaganovich," "Gergez," and other petroleum companies have tried to absorb the spraying oil, condense the black bursting rock, form wells from open warehouses, lay gasoline pumps, and so on.

As a result, the progress is very rapid. The company has not only completed but also exceeded the national plan in a concrete way. The daily gasoline production has increased by 20%, especially the Toras of the Oljonikitzi Petroleum Company has achieved the best results in gasoline extraction. It can be guaranteed to systematically extract gasoline from new wells, and at the same time, pumps and black bursting rocks should be equipped.

The government has now promulgated a ban on the construction of new oil wells and oil ponds extracting gasoline without the implementation of work on January 1, 1941. This ban applies to secret construction work, as well as the general development of business economy.

Regarding the construction work of the two gas plants, the only problem lies in guaranteeing the extraction of volatile oil extracted from petroleum in the short term. Therefore, new factories should be built to transport the gasoline of existing gas plants in a short period of time. The work of the Baku and Gruz factories is not fully capable, although they have the possibility of transportation.

In the past two years, great work must be carried out to utilize liquid gas, showing the fractured haystacks of natural gasoline fractionation in liquid gas. The huge development of gasoline volatile oil production encourages the expansion of liquid gas resources.

Liquid gas is used as a substitute fuel for automobile transportation, and the Soviet Union has entered the experimental period. Designed by government agencies, attempts are made to lead the way and widely introduce the excellent parts. Automobile supply stations must establish gas plants (existing or under construction) under the jurisdiction of aircraft and automobile storage warehouses. The construction of the first station in Baku has been completed.

The relevant People's Committees (such as the three committees of Medium Machines, Black Metals, and Petroleum) expressed that they cannot delay on this issue, and the Liu Beretzki Factory's liquid gas plant will transport the volatile oil to the Moscow bus yard (about two to three months) in a short period of time. The Moscow Municipal Government issued this order as early as 1939, but it has not been done yet.

In the third five-year plan, efforts are made to produce and utilize natural gasoline in the deep gasoline production areas. The equipment in the production area is still insufficient and needs to be greatly organized and explored.

In the past two years, the utilization of gasoline must be developed, with the western region of Ukraine in the Guangmi Autonomous Region of Izrum being the most important.

The Dashava, Obaoli, and Kaloshi production areas that have now been built can guarantee the gasoline supply for industries and cities in western Ukraine. To reserve and increase the needs of the region, the gasoline pumping ditch will communicate with the Kief area. Kief has been making gasoline supply drafts for five years, but it is not sufficient, so it imports Donetsk fuel.

The Izrum gasoline production area has 11 oil wells. The gasoline from Izrum can be transferred to the industrial centers of North Ural, Berezhniki, Sulegemsk, Molotov, and other places by a distribution pipe. The implementation of this transfer gasoline over a long distance should be reorganized.

In addition, it is necessary to organize the gasoline exploration of Dagestan, where chemical glass, iodine, and other factories have been established, but the vast Dagestan production area has not been fully utilized.

The Zaporozhye state refines gasoline, which can greatly develop the along-Azov proletariat area near Melitopol. The oil springs are only 70 to 80 yards deep, and it takes only 10 to 15 days to open a well. Voloshilovsk in the Olteyo Kitzi border area can also be developed.

From 1941 to 1942, petroleum industry workers will vigorously promote the natural gasoline industry, which is the most powerful preparation for the Soviet Union's national economy.

### Seeing, Hearing, and Thinking

The Ministry of Finance reiterated the ban on privately purchasing gold. A certain person frankly said: "It doesn't matter—I'm doing futures."

Everyone is worried about the price of rice in Shanghai after the outbreak of war between Japan and the United States, and hoarders are preparing to make a fortune. Unfortunately, when that time comes, the hoarded grain in the warehouse will become the Japanese army's military grain, and it will all be confiscated and "publicly" charged. The only way for hoarders to prepare for a rainy day is to quickly get out of the cage, but unfortunately, no one wants to be a scapegoat. As a result, the rice price plummeted, completely unexpectedly.

The fixed deposit for group purchases of rice is 40 yuan per bag. Transactions in the rice market have never paid a deposit. At the end of last year, there was a method of paying a fixed deposit of 5 yuan per bag. But it always gives people a different feeling of "restriction" and "reward." Speaking of which, they are all good deeds to "stabilize the people's food."

The rice brokers temporarily suspended entering the market the day before yesterday, saying that "at this time of chaos in the rice market, they will temporarily suspend entering the market as intermediaries to avoid external criticism." Some people said, "This is coy," but no one would pay attention to their pretty faces. Some people said, "This is a strike." That's right: there was a notice on the surface that "rice stored in the warehouse should be cleared within a time limit" that day.

As soon as the news of the reduction in power supply came out, the price of yarn became popular. But no one thought that if coal could not continue to come and the power had to be reduced, the cloth would also have no customers.

### The Secret of Rising Prices

— Shen Leichun

Since the recent tensions in the Far East, the question of war or peace between the US and Japan has drawn widespread attention, particularly among speculators who manipulate the market. They view the Sino-Japanese conflict and any related international issues in the Far East as opportunities to create artificial market fluctuations. Especially in Shanghai, wealthy merchants with vast amounts of floating capital operate in three stages: first, fabricating rumors; second, hoarding goods; and third, raising prices. These three actions are inherently intertwined. However, for the sake of resistance and national reconstruction, the future of the Chinese nation, and the overall improvement of people's livelihoods, how should we curb rising prices? This is arguably the most critical issue on the economic front.

The rise in Shanghai prices differs from that in the interior. Since the outbreak of the European and Asian wars, Shanghai's transportation lines have not faced the same absolute difficulties as those in Free China. Therefore, Shanghai's soaring prices are not due to transportation difficulties or supply-demand imbalances. In contrast, the types and multiples of price increases in the interior last autumn were: first, metal materials up twelvefold; second, fuel up ninefold; third, clothing up sevenfold; fourth, miscellaneous goods up slightly over fourfold; fifth, construction materials up fourfold; and sixth, food up threefold. This reflects the general situation in the interior, where transportation is relatively convenient. However, in Shanghai, while prices are generally rising, the types of increases differ significantly, almost in inverse proportion. Food and daily necessities have seen the most substantial increases. As stated in the Shanghai News editorial, "Since the war, the highest price increases have been for rice, coal, and flour, nearing tenfold." Therefore, attributing Shanghai's price increases to supply-demand imbalances is a complete misrepresentation.

Although Shanghai is part of Chinese society, its economic structure differs from the semi-feudal, semi-colonial nature of Free China. It is a component of the comprador class; semi-feudalism does not truly exist there. However, since the National Army's westward retreat and Shanghai's transformation into an isolated island, its economy has grown and developed in a distorted manner. The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines were originally prosperous regions. After their homelands were occupied, wealthy individuals with large amounts of liquid capital mostly retreated with banks from the occupied areas. Although they were considered "high-class refugees," finding a place as "retired gentlemen" in Shanghai, where integration into the comprador class was difficult, their options for managing these vast funds were limited to investment and speculation.

Therefore, I believe the problem of rising prices in Shanghai is not truly about supply-demand imbalances. We should not believe the nonsense of speculators, especially rice weevils. Supply-demand imbalances have their own price equilibrium laws. The current price increases in Shanghai deviate significantly from these laws, so we assert that it is not a matter of supply-demand imbalances.

Some self-proclaimed economists believe that war inevitably leads to currency inflation. However, considering the price increases in Shanghai, it cannot be attributed to increased legal tender circulation. We all know that since Shanghai became an isolated island, the available floating capital that can be statistically accounted for has reached 200 billion yuan. However, according to the official figures released by the four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China) at the end of June last year, the total amount of legal tender issued was just over 390 billion yuan. If all the floating capital in Shanghai were legal tender, the four banks' legal tender issuance would certainly exceed this figure. This proves that Shanghai's floating capital is mostly in bank deposits and public bond futures, while large holdings of legal tender as wealth are rare. Therefore, Shanghai's floating capital consists more of intangible legal tender than tangible legal tender. It can be said that the high prices in Shanghai cannot be attributed to either supply-demand imbalances or currency inflation.

However, in recent years, ordinary people, deeply affected by the rising cost of living, have coined a new phrase: "Paper money is worthless." This phrase originates from currency inflation. Although currency inflation leads to a decline in currency value, which affects price increases, this is an irrefutable argument. However, in general currency inflation, the resulting price increases are gradual. The recent soaring prices in Shanghai are not gradual but jump-like, especially changing with the changing political climate. Although the legal tender issued by the four banks before the war was only slightly over 140 billion yuan, less than three times the 390 billion yuan, the price increases in Shanghai are not significantly related to the increased currency issuance.

Ultimately, stabilizing the value of legal tender is essential for wartime economic policy. However, curbing prices is a practical measure to prevent rampant currency inflation.

Some also say that the decline in foreign exchange rates is a reason for rising prices. Shanghai, in particular, is a major market for the foreign exchange black market. In countries with economically dependent economies, the exchange rate inevitably influences prices. We also acknowledge that China's economic strength is not yet fully independent. This is an undeniable fact. When the war began, the legal tender exchange rate against the British pound was one shilling and two and a half pence, the official exchange rate. Up to now, judging from the rate of decline in the exchange rate, it has fallen by only about three-quarters. The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, linked to the British pound, is almost the same. In terms of exchange rates, the price of imported foreign goods should increase by about four times to balance the exchange rate ratio. However, the current price of imported foreign goods has risen by seven or eight to ten times compared to the beginning of the war. This indicates that the exchange rate fluctuation is not the main reason for soaring prices. Even more strangely, the current soaring prices are primarily for domestically produced and sold daily necessities, which are irrelevant to the fall of the foreign exchange black market.

Stabilizing foreign exchange black market prices is also necessary for wartime foreign economic policy. However, the reason for the decline in Shanghai's foreign exchange black market is not the recent surge in foreign goods imports. The main reason is that one party is using legal tender to acquire foreign exchange. Secondly, wealthy merchants and corrupt elements are fleeing overseas with their funds, causing Shanghai's black market foreign exchange to continuously decline. Currently, the foreign goods imported into Shanghai are not primarily military equipment or food, although they exist, but are secondary. The main imports are luxury goods consumed by wealthy and noble individuals. They have money, manipulate the market in Shanghai, profit from the national crisis, and live a life of extravagance. Ordinary people, although they do not need foreign goods or consume foreign exchange, bear the responsibility of using foreign currency for the domestic goods they use. That is, the prices of domestic goods rise simultaneously, outpacing the price increases of foreign goods. This is because the few who use foreign goods hoard domestic goods, causing trouble with 200 billion yuan of floating capital, not the depreciation of foreign exchange.

If the above three factors are not the main reasons for the secret of rising prices, then it is hoarding and speculation. We also believe this is the case. Although the above three points can contribute to rising prices, they are not the main reason. The main culprit is the hoarding and speculation caused by the accumulation of 200 billion yuan of floating capital.

Hoarding goods and monopolizing for profit are not investment but speculative behavior. Since the war, they have witnessed the destruction and damage caused to national industries near Shanghai by the war and the enemy, the control of occupied areas, the blockade of Free China, and the lack of materials and transportation difficulties in the interior. All these provide opportunities for speculators to exploit. Hoarding and speculation are inherently speculative activities. For the sake of stability, they primarily hoard daily necessities. The soaring prices of daily necessities now serve as proof.

Speculators, seeking to profit from the national crisis, have cast national welfare and people's livelihood to the winds. They see that the more they hoard, the higher prices rise, and the greater their profits become. However, they fail to realize that rising prices weaken consumers' purchasing power, leading to social panic due to livelihood anxieties. The war is prolonged, and ordinary people suffer more. Although the National Government is promoting production and thrift, it is being offset by the hoarding and speculation of speculators. The path to victory from the hardships of the people is prolonged. All this is thanks to the speculators who hoard and speculate.

It is difficult to reduce prices back to their original levels. However, if we can eliminate the speculators who hoard and speculate, at least Shanghai's prices can fall somewhat. Even if it is difficult to bring them down, we can prevent future price increases.

Sanctioning hoarding is an urgent matter. However, how to sanction it is the immediate concern. Some advocate: first, moral sanctions; second, political sanctions; third, warning sanctions. However, others say that moral sanctions are a waste of time for speculators. Political sanctions cannot be implemented when the National Government's orders reach Shanghai because Shanghai is already an isolated island. Warning sanctions can only lead to punishment when warnings are ineffective. However, I believe that the spirit of mobilization should be implemented in Shanghai, using moral, political, and warning methods simultaneously. Although it should not be overdone, it is better than doing nothing. At least some effect can be achieved in the future. The secret of rising prices is not a mystery. We only need to quickly implement sanctions against hoarders and speculators from multiple perspectives.

Commercial News

### Sugar Market: Raw White Initially Weak, Then Firm

Yesterday's sugar market saw mixed trends. Raw white was initially weak but rebounded. The association's benchmark prices were 79.10 to 79.80 yuan for raw white spot goods at the outer warehouses, and 79.60 to 80.20 yuan for this month's delivery futures (12th), and 80.02 to 80.05 yuan for the 20th delivery. Taikoo's refined white sugar B mark was 80.50 to 80.80 yuan at the western warehouse and 80 yuan at the eastern warehouse. DY mark was 78 yuan at the eastern warehouse, and HX mark was 77.80 to 78 yuan at the western warehouse, a slight increase of 0.02 yuan.

### North-South Goods: Hainan Dried Longan Continues to Rise

Miscellaneous Roads Longan Opens Today

Hainan dried longan: Market reports that there are more goods in stock at Shenshi stores, but costs are high, so the market is very tight. High-quality goods have risen to 181 yuan, and dealer prices have also risen by 5 yuan, with high-quality goods selling for 185 yuan. Tong'an goods have lacked arrivals since the spring due to high production prices. In the future, the market prices of both parties may converge, and more arrivals are expected.

Miscellaneous roads dried longan: Because spring sales are weak, store goods have not yet been released. Recently, dealers on both sides have gradually reached an agreement. Today, it is planned to release a portion first, which is expected to be looser than before, in order to develop sales.

### Seafood: Tapioca Starch Continues to Rise

Tapioca starch: Because the source is expected to be obstructed, both dealers and speculators are very active, and it continues to rise. Yesterday's market prices: Flying Unicorn 125 yuan, Lao Qilin 110 yuan, Double TA mark 88 yuan, Double T mark 80 yuan, C mark 55 yuan, large sago 95 yuan, small sago 53 yuan.

### Sichuan Pepper Fails to Drop Significantly

Sichuan pepper: Recent arrivals are not many. The previous market opened at 216 yuan, which can be said to have reached a peak, then fell to 212 yuan. Yesterday's market opened with 2,000 packages, priced at 210 yuan, a slight decline, but it has not dropped significantly.

### Piece Goods: Among Woolens, Only Plush Falls

Recently, the prices of woolen goods, whether yarn, silk, woolen fabrics from local factories or foreign goods, have been firm, and most are still rising. Only plush goods (except camel hair) such as mohair, sea tiger plush, long and short hair sea dragon plush, bear hair plush, and spiral plush have been falling in price. Sellers are willing to cut prices to sell, but in fact, even if they are cheap, no one is buying. Those who need them only need the fast-selling products of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Because plush is only suitable for winter coats, it is now off-season. To wait for the market, one must wait another seven or eight months. Moreover, prices have reached their peak. If new goods can arrive, the cost can still be calculated. Moreover, the colors are incomplete, and there is a large inventory, which makes importers even more disinterested. Currently, ordinary mohair is sold at a reduced price of 75 yuan, long-haired sea dragon plush at 61 yuan, short-haired at 56-57 yuan, bear hair plush with the Water Overflowing Jinshan brand at 63 yuan, and spiral plush at 12 yuan.

### Coffee (Continued)

— Gao Jiannong

The custom of drinking coffee was introduced to Egypt in the early 16th century and to Europe in the mid-17th century. After the Turkish ambassador used it to entertain guests, it became even more popular. However, at that time, the coffee trade was entirely controlled by the Egyptians. They transported coffee from the city of Moka to various European countries, and like various monopoly organizations, the value was of course arbitrarily determined. This inevitably made Europeans feel exploited and annoyed. They were unwilling to rely on the Egyptians and pay them such a transit tax. In 1710, merchants from Saint-Male in the Brittany region of France formed a company to bypass the Cape of Good Hope in Africa and directly purchase coffee in Moka. At the same time, Europeans saw that the need for coffee was increasing day by day and the profits were high, so they also tried to cultivate it in various colonies. The first to realize this plan was the Dutchman Nicolas Witsen. In 1690, he brought the first coffee tree to Java, and by 1743, he was able to transport 3.5 million catties of coffee beans to the Dutch mother country! The coffee trees on Ceylon and India were all passed down from Java. France first had coffee trees in 1714, the year the Spanish War of Succession ended. The mayor of Amsterdam in the Netherlands obtained some coffee trees from Java and gifted one to the famous French King Louis XIV, who planted it in the famous Paris Botanical Garden. In 1723 AD, a French officer named De Clieu obtained a special permit from King Louis XV to carry three coffee trees propagated from the botanical garden across the sea to Martinique Island in the West Indies to take up his post. On the way, water was in short supply, and two coffee trees had already withered. De Clieu could not bear to let the beloved third tree dry up, so he shared his last sip of water with the small tree, saving its life. This was the beginning of coffee trees in the West Indies. Later, almost all the coffee trees on the islands were direct descendants of this one tree. As for Brazil, which now holds the reins of coffee beans, producing 80-90% of the world's output, its formal cultivation of coffee trees started later, beginning in 1815, although a priest had already transplanted coffee trees there in 1773.

Now let's talk about the brief history of coffee shops, which occupy such an important position in modern cities socially and are as numerous as teahouses and taverns. The establishment of coffee shops actually began in the early 15th century, first discovered in the holy city of Mecca in Islam. Later, throughout the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt, and Syria, they were established everywhere like bamboo shoots after rain. The first coffee shop in Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire, was in 1553, opened by two Syrians. Since the establishment of this coffee shop, countless Muslims have flocked to it in droves, and the business has flourished day by day. The Islamic religious leader, witnessing this situation, feared that Islamic churches would be deserted in the future and would become a wilderness, so he ordered the coffee shop to be closed. The customers who drank coffee were fined on the date of the public judgment, wearing animal skins as black as coffee grounds, and the two owners of the coffee shop were each beaten eighty times. However, drinking coffee has already become a trend and cannot be suppressed by violence. Later, the ban was lifted, and coffee shops were opened everywhere again, but they had to pay some taxes to the state. Coffee shops in France were first established in Marseille in 1654. Later, in 1672, the Procope coffee shop and the Pascal coffee shop in Paris, which have long been famous in history and are frequented by countless famous writers, philosophers, or politicians as gathering places, were also established one after another. Moreover, the Procope coffee shop was the first to invent and manufacture "frozen ripples" for supply, which was immediately welcomed by customers and became popular everywhere. Coffee shops in London were established in 1662, but their number increased so quickly that in 1665 King Charles II was already somewhat frightened and had to close them: saying that this was a den of filth, a nest of treacherous people full of conspiracies! As for the coffee shops in other major European cities, they also sprang up almost simultaneously everywhere. Later, some people came up with new tricks, attaching performances, dances, and music to the coffee shop to attract customers, and its business was of course becoming more and more prosperous, following the current situation.

### The New Life Movement in the Family

— Zhang Mengzhao

The New Life Movement promoted by Chairman Chiang has quickly been going on for seven full years. In these seven full years, how many people have gotten rid of old bad habits and embarked on a new path? And how many people abide by propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and practice the standards of orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, and frugality, promptness, and reliability? Thinking from the individual to the situation of a family, most are scattered, disorganized, and without order. Things are piled up randomly and do not look good. The housewife entrusts everything to ignorant servants, but she herself enjoys painting bamboo at night in the amusement park (i.e., playing mahjong), watching movies, listening to operas, and dancing at will. The next day, the sun is already high, but she still hasn't gotten up, her hair is disheveled, and her spirit is low. What orderliness and cleanliness are there? What simplicity, frugality, promptness, and reliability are there? This phenomenon is especially true for families on the isolated island, which is known as the paradise of adventurers. Secondly, the prevalence of smoking and gambling in homes in the occupied areas is also an undeniable fact. Chairman Chiang said, "This is everyone's internal enemy who is self-destructing!" These are truly incisive words. The author believes that whether housewives can practice the "New Life Movement in the Family" is the starting point for the revival of the nation. Ancient sages said, "Cultivate oneself and then regulate the family; regulate the family and then govern the state; govern the state and then pacify the world." The family precepts of the sage Zhu Bolu also say, "Get up at dawn, sweep and clean the courtyard, keep the inside and outside clean, rest when it is dark, and personally check the doors..." All these are "maxims" for housewives to manage their families. To have a "prosperous and never-declining family," one must practice the standards of orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, frugality, promptness, and reliability to be effective.

Everyone should deeply remember and strive to believe in and follow the broadcast speech given by Chairman Chiang at the 7th Anniversary Commemoration Meeting. He said, "...Why do we promote propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame? Everyone must know that the opposite of 'propriety' is not valuing order, not abiding by discipline, and not being familiar with the rules; the opposite of 'righteousness' is not speaking of integrity, not fulfilling one's duties, and not being responsible; the opposite of 'integrity' is not understanding right and wrong, not distinguishing between public and private, and not valuing moral character; the opposite of 'shame' is having no integrity, no sense of shame, and no awareness; therefore, we must correct these shortcomings to be considered practicing the 'Four Cardinal Principles'....Everyone must know that the opposite of 'orderliness' is chaos and disorganization; the opposite of 'cleanliness' is filth and corruption; the opposite of 'simplicity' is complexity and tediousness; the opposite of 'frugality' is luxury and extravagance; the opposite of 'promptness' is slowness and numbness; the opposite of 'reliability' is hypocrisy and deception. If these six major ills can be completely eradicated, China's nation-building work will advance rapidly...." I say that in the family, being able to achieve what Chairman Chiang has indicated to eradicate those six major ills, this great family is a strong cell in China's nation-building work. Housewives! Arise! Cleanse yourselves! In the big and small aspects of "food, clothing, housing, and transportation" in the family, quickly achieve the six major living standards of orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, frugality, promptness, and reliability, strictly abide by the discipline of life, and then you will be worthy of the new families of the future new China.

### Do Chinese Women Really Need Hats?

— Yi Zhen

After reading Mr. Si's great work "Why Chinese Women Don't Have Hats" in the current issue of this publication on July 24, I truly admire Mr. Si's thorough research on Chinese women's hats. However, is it really necessary for Chinese women to have hats? That needs to be discussed.

It is undeniable that Chinese women are not absolutely without hats, and the elimination of phoenix coronets and headscarves can be taken as proof that they have no hats or do not use hats. However, it is absolutely not possible to think that this is the reason for the lack of hats. You must know that "lack" and "absence" are completely different!

As for the popularity of hairnets and ribbons, saying that "Chinese women need hats" is also somewhat far-fetched. Let's not talk about the fact that women will not get nervous diseases because they don't wear hats. In fact, the popularity of hairnets and ribbons is only to avoid disheveled hair. This can be confirmed by the current trend of young girls wearing braids and the prevalence of hair combing among middle-aged and older women. Speaking of "accidentally discovering that rural women wear bowl-shaped hats" also means that this is formed due to the special living environment of the women. At the same time, it can be seen that in the living circle of most Chinese women, there is no such superfluous so-called "need"!

Practically speaking, foreign women wear hats because of their own historical background and traditional customs. And the fact that the strange hats of the seven dwarfs can be popular in the United States can be used to understand the shortcomings of American women's psychology! Chinese women who wear cheongsams will never blindly sigh for hats in this way, unless she is a complete and authentic foreign slave!

Whether women's hats are needed is as described above. Moreover, today's China is practicing the movement of frugality, who would be foolish enough to be willing to bear the suspicion of running counter to it?

Finally, there are two points that the author thinks are worth mentioning: First, the only condition for clothing is practicality, not peculiarity. Second, although European clothing has its merits, blindly imitating it and acting as the tail of foreigners is absolutely unacceptable.

### Economic Rice Cooking Method

— Ying Jun

Now that the price of rice is like pearls and firewood like cassia, everyone feels life is difficult. The isolated island is affected by the current situation, and business is inferior to last year. Therefore, the difficulty of making a living can be imagined. There is no way to increase income, so reducing expenditure is urgent. However, the ways to economize are numerous and broad, and cannot be fully described in a short article. Here, I will first describe in detail how to cook delicious white rice with an economical method for the three meals a day, so that you can choose from them:

Every day, save two or three bowls of leftover cold rice. When cooking rice, mix the cold rice into the washed rice and stir well. Then put it into the pot and cook it in the same way as usual. The cooked rice will definitely be more than the pure rice cooked without adding cold rice. This cold rice is commonly known as "cold rice mother," which means endless generation. According to my experience, the ratio of cold rice to uncooked rice should not exceed one-third, otherwise the taste will be inferior. For example, if a family of eight needs eight bowls of rice per meal, and about twenty-four bowls of rice are cooked, if one and a half bowls of cold rice are added, then twenty-seven bowls of rice will be cooked, enough for nine people to eat. The added one and a half bowls of rice can save half a bowl of uncooked rice. Over time, the money saved on rice each year is also considerable. Anyone who wants to try the above method, please cook one or two more bowls of rice first, and keep it as the cold rice mother for the next meal, ready to be mixed with uncooked rice for cooking.

### The Strange Stones of Huang Garden

— Bai Shi

Gardens occupy a very important place in one's residence, and can even be said to be a spiritual food. However, on this isolated island, there are very few gardens with equipment, as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.

A garden must have a few exquisite Taihu stones to embellish it, so that the garden can be more beautiful and you can get a lot of elegance. Therefore, the garden and Taihu stones are inseparable. Speaking of Taihu stones, wrinkles, transparency, thinness, and leakage are the four necessary conditions. If one of them is missing, it cannot be considered a top-grade strange stone. On the isolated island after the war, it is not easy to see such a perfect Taihu stone. However, I recently discovered many strange stones in Huang Garden on Gaun Road, and the most peculiar one is the stone carved with "Little Weaver Girl Stone." It is about seven or eight feet high, weighs about two or three tons, and has all the four conditions of wrinkles, transparency, thinness, and leakage. It does not look like a natural Taihu stone, but seems to be carved by hand. According to the dictionary, the origin of the "Weaver Girl Stone" is: "Someone was looking for the source of the river and saw a woman washing silk. He asked her, and she said that this was the Milky Way. So he gave her a stone and went home. He asked Yan Junping, and Junping said that this was the Weaver Girl's Weaver Stone." This stone is called "Little Weaver Girl Stone," and its mystery can be known. The second most important stone is the "Cloud" stone, which is even larger than the "Little Weaver Girl Stone." The characters carved on the stone are very old. Later, according to Mr. Huang Yueyuan, the owner of the garden, "This batch of Taihu stones was removed from an old garden between Suzhou and Changshu, and transported to Shanghai, which took a lot of effort. Moreover, I haven't been out of the barbed wire fence for a year, but when I heard this news, I was very excited and resolutely stepped out of the barbed wire fence and brought back these souvenirs..." The old gentleman was very talkative and energetic. I walked around the garden and saw that the dragon cypress, red maple, weeping plum, etc. were planted in an orderly manner. There were also thousands of peonies, which would be very beautiful when they bloom in the future. I heard that there is a kind of yellow peony, which is very precious. So I made an appointment with the old gentleman to appreciate the peonies, and I will definitely go there to broaden my horizons in the future. He has hundreds of acres of planting fields in Zhenru, which is very large. I heard that the trees in Zhang Garden, which recently opened, are also completely produced in the Zhenru planting field, and were arranged by his son, Mr. Delin. Such courage is really admirable.

Water chestnuts are originally a very ordinary thing among fruits, but it is said that they have the effect of clearing heat and digesting food. It can be eaten as a fruit, or it can be used as an auxiliary product for meat and vegetarian dishes. Cantonese families often use it. Although we are not from Guangdong, we also like to use it to cook. For example, when stir-frying diced meat, diced chicken, or stir-fried shrimp, cut the water chestnuts into small pieces and stir-fry them together. When eating, you feel that it is crisp and sweet, and it is especially delicious. As for vegetarian dishes, such as braised vegetarian ten scenes, stir-fried bamboo shoots with dried mushrooms, you can also add water chestnuts, whether you cut them into dices or slices, they are very suitable.

### The Art of Scolding People

— Xiaomu Feng

It is said that there is also an art to scolding people.

I am a fool, and I can't understand the meaning of this sentence. So, Lao Zhang volunteered to explain it to me.

"For example," he said solemnly, "for example, you are talking with a colleague who is in a similar situation to you, and everyone is complaining about the hardships of life, resenting the rising prices and no increase in income. At that time, if you pat your colleague on the arm, and sincerely and solemnly say to him——

Damn it, that stingy section chief! He never increases our allowance, what are we supposed to eat? Drink air! Drink wind! Seeing how stingy he is, he will never accomplish great things! … If you, old brother, were the section chief, huh! Then everyone would have a way to survive! Isn't that right? You, old brother, have always been tolerant and generous!

——As you speak, you have to smile, and at the end, you have to give him a thumbs up. Then, then your colleague will be very happy, and he will laugh with you!" Lao Zhang stopped here and took a breath.

But I'm still at a loss. What does this have to do with the phrase "There is also an art to scolding people"?

Lao Zhang saw my confused face and knew that I hadn't understood yet. So, he first made a face at me, then showed his gold-inlaid teeth, sprayed saliva, and said to me:

"Old brother, don't you understand? You scolded the section chief and flattered your colleague, isn't that killing two birds with one stone? If you only scold the section chief, that's too dangerous. In case your colleague messes with you and goes to the section chief to expose your shortcomings, then you, then you… , you understand yourself. Now, you flattered him, so he won't mess with you behind your back, and you yourself, after scolding, can finally let out a breath of anger…" Lao Zhang is a "big guy" and spoke breathlessly. I really felt sorry for him because he sincerely taught me "the art of scolding people." He continued:

"Moreover… and on the other hand, you also scolded that colleague. After scolding him, he still agrees and laughs with you, thinking that you flattered him!" Lao Zhang actually laughed loudly, and I even saw a small piece of green vegetable leaf in the gap next to his gold-inlaid tooth.

I was even more at a loss.

Lao Zhang stopped laughing, made another face, patted my shoulder again, and said

"Old brother, how can you not understand? Your colleague is just a small clerk like you, and he is not a section chief, and he will… he will never be a section chief… When you say that, aren't you also scolding him, scolding him? And he's still happy!" Lao Zhang laughed again, laughing until he couldn't catch his breath.

I laughed with him too. But, immediately I felt confused again… I couldn't help but ask Lao Zhang, "Is this the art of scolding people? But, but we don't have that damn section chief in our shop!"

Lao Zhang laughed even harder and fell on the sofa, unable to stand up.

"You're really a fool!" Finally, Lao Zhang barely suppressed his laughter and said.

I also felt that I was a bit of a fool, and after working so hard for so long, I still couldn't understand the meaning of these few words. I had no choice but to reward the hard-working Lao Zhang with a smile. Suddenly, I remembered that Lao Zhang scolded me "fool" but I still smiled at him. "Damn it! This is the art of scolding people!" I thought.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(4) Unexpected Encounter

"What do you want to eat?"

Although Begonia himself was not a fat man, he also knew the relationship between food and fat men. Four meals a day were absolutely necessary for Zhao Si, especially when he needed him to run errands. Eating his fill was the top priority, so without waiting for him to say anything else, he hurriedly asked the waiter to make twenty pot stickers and bring a bowl of pork noodles.

Zhao Si stopped yawning.

"Third Master's matter, I heard that it was done very interestingly, like a farce. Haven't you heard Seventh Master talk about it?" While waiting for the noodles and pot stickers, Zhao Si suddenly asked this question out of the blue.

"What's the matter?"

"Didn't you know about his marrying that concubine from Tianjin?"

"No." Begonia said without the slightest interest.

"According to a friend," Zhao Si was most happy to mind other people's business. "That woman was completely tricked by Third Master!"

Begonia only gave a cold smile. Although he didn't know about this matter, judging from Yuan Baofan's usual behavior, how could he not do such a thing? Tricking was still being polite. When he was happy, he would have to rob people!

"I heard that Seventh Master's photo was used for the match."

"Seventh Master's photo?" This made Begonia feel very strange! Because he knew Yuan Shaowen's character, and he firmly believed that no matter what, he would not help his uncle.

"I don't know if it's true." Zhao Si stretched his head out the door to take a look, wondering why the pot stickers and noodles hadn't come yet. "I just heard people say that that woman is very fierce, a female student. Later, she quarreled with Third Master until the sky turned upside down, and she refused to give up. Seventh Master also blamed Third Master for being wrong. That night, he slipped back to Beijing, unwilling to mediate for him again. Thanks to Governor Hu and some officials here, who tried their best to mediate, the matter was settled. As a result, Third Master also agreed to her three major demands. I guess the reason why he didn't go back to Beijing to live with the first wife must have been stipulated like that!"

"In that case, Seventh Master's photo was probably also tricked away by Third Master." Begonia nodded and said.

"That's right!" Zhao Si hurriedly followed his tone and said, "Seventh Master is much more decent than Third Master!"

### "Sweeping Snow" and "Peeling Skin"

— Jue Hui

"Everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door, and doesn't care about the frost on other people's roofs." This is a "God-given teaching"; we are "eating according to God," so naturally we shouldn't have any behavior that goes against God; therefore, just "sweep the snow."

But now there are people who don't even sweep the "snow"!

Not sweeping the "snow" is still a minor matter; who knows that when people see that you don't sweep, they will sweep all the "snow" to your door! If everyone sweeps, day after day, wouldn't it be to "cover up death" and then stop?

Or, you think that once the "sunlight" comes out, the "snow" will "melt" by itself; however, before it comes out, it is not just "not melting"!

Taking a step back, even so, you can still "barely survive" for a while; but nothing is worse than "choking your throat and caressing your back"……

The Book of Changes says: "Stripping the bed with the skin, it is close to disaster." Now that it is close to the pain of "skinning", how can we turn a blind eye and let people "peel" us?

### Happy to Enjoy Happiness

— Hongshui

You are happy to enjoy happiness, I am happy to enjoy happiness, he is happy to enjoy happiness, everyone is happy to enjoy happiness, forming the "happy to enjoy happiness" isolated island.

The performance of "happy to enjoy happiness" is wonderful every day, and the development of "happy to enjoy happiness" is amazing every moment. Listen: go to the movies in the afternoon, listen to plays in the evening, go to the hotel tomorrow (play mahjong), run to the gambling den the day after tomorrow (scrounge for freebies and eat big meals), the day after the day after tomorrow……

So the movie theater pulls the iron door tightly all day long, the theater tickets are sold out every other day, so the hotel rooms are noisy and full (you can't spend money, book a month in advance!), so

Madness, the enthusiastic "happy to enjoy happiness"!

However, the more people who are "happy to enjoy happiness", the more people seem to be "doomed to be unlucky". Look: the "full" refugee camps and beggar shelters (this place is not worthy of being called full.) The "daily statistics" of the hungry and frozen (today's newspaper can add this column, alas!), the days of welcoming the God of Wealth must be counted, the suicides are committing suicide with "methods" that are constantly innovating…… The "mold" that is discharged from the "Adventureland" that "should" "fall" also created a void…… (Unprecedented what, clumsy me, can't say)

Therefore, in short, the more people who are "happy to enjoy happiness", the more people who are "doomed to be unlucky" will follow, but, but the people on the isolated island are always these people, right? When the "unlucky" are finished, how will the "happy" enjoy it?
