### The United States Quietly Awaits Japan's Reply, Tensions Show No Sign of Easing, Kurusu Claims Continued Progress, Washington Figures Note Japan's Delaying Tactics

Reuters, Washington, 2nd - U.S.-Japan relations are currently in a serious crisis. Unless Japan's reply significantly changes the situation in Tokyo, this crisis will continue. This is the prevailing view among well-informed sources in Washington. They believe that President Roosevelt's hasty return to the capital indicates that major changes are imminent. However, until Japan's reply arrives, the situation remains deadlocked, and the atmosphere of extreme tension remains unchanged.

Reuters, Washington, 2nd - Japan's reply has not yet arrived, and the tension remains unchanged. Currently, what Washington figures are paying attention to is the news from authoritative sources in Tokyo, which states that Japan hopes the Washington talks will continue for at least two more weeks. Some observers believe that this means Japan's preparations for war are expected to be completed in two weeks. There is little hope here that Japan's reply will allow the discussions to continue, as Japanese Prime Minister Tojo has already rejected the principles on which the U.S. proposal for resolving the Pacific issue is based.

Reuters, Tokyo, 1st - This morning, the leading newspapers carried editorials with the same opinion, stating that although U.S.-Japan views are very different, Japan still holds a calm position of continuing the Washington talks. Many Tokyo observers now believe that Japan has issued a reply that will prevent the situation from worsening. It is likely that this reply was passed by an emergency cabinet meeting yesterday.

Reuters, Washington, 2nd - After Secretary of State Hull spoke with the Japanese ambassador yesterday, President Roosevelt held a lengthy meeting with Hull and Chief of Naval Operations Stark at noon.

United Press, Washington, 2nd - According to Special Envoy Kurusu, he has not yet received the Japanese government's reply to the United States. The talks on the 1st cannot be considered the "final" negotiations, and he anticipates that the negotiations will continue.

United Press, Washington, 2nd - It is revealed here that Under Secretary of State Welles and British Ambassador Halifax also met for about twenty minutes yesterday. Afterwards, Welles hurriedly went to the White House. This development reflects the state of tension in Washington regarding the Far East situation.

Kurusu and Nomura Meet with Hull Again to Review Past Discussions

Reuters, Washington, 2nd - Japanese Ambassador Nomura and Special Envoy Kurusu went to the Secretary of State's office yesterday morning and met with Hull for over an hour. They looked worried as they left. A reporter stepped forward and asked if the U.S.-Japan positions were still far apart. Nomura replied, "I believe that preserving the situation must be a wise political move. We are under the government's orders and will meet with Hull again. This time, we are only reviewing the points of previous talks with the Secretary of State." State Department officials said that Japan's reply to Hull's statement explaining the U.S. position should be sent soon. The President just returned from Warm Springs and, apart from dining with Hopkins, did not have any appointments.

Reuters, Washington, 2nd - After meeting with Hull yesterday, Kurusu looked tired and solemn as he left the State Department, while Nomura, although trying to appear optimistic, could not hide his anxiety. Considering Tojo's statements about sweeping away British and American influence in East Asia, and Togo's criticism of American principles as absurd, it is widely expected that the Japanese reply currently being awaited will not significantly change Tokyo's position. Kurusu used diplomatic tactics yesterday, suggesting that Tojo's remarks were misinterpreted, but he remained silent and unable to defend Togo's criticism of American principles. People here have sympathy for Kurusu personally, as it is rare for an envoy to be both tasked by the government and betrayed by it. Since Kurusu was ordered to come here, hardly a day has passed without Tokyo cabinet members making hostile or arrogant remarks sufficient to hinder his discussions. However, Hull has shown great patience. It is unknown how much valuable time Kurusu has had to spend in the past half month explaining the bizarre remarks made by so-called responsible officials in the Tokyo government to Hull. Kurusu cannot control his own government, nor can he oppose the unyielding principles of the United States. Even if he is sincere, his position is hopeless. Although Washington still hopes that war can be avoided, there is no optimism. As everyone knows, Japan will lose if it fights, but Japan is still struggling to push its point closer to war. Its position is dubious.

Japanese Cabinet Holds Regular Meeting Yesterday Morning to Exchange U.S.-Japan Views

Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd - According to Japanese sources, a regular cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's residence at 10:00 this morning. Cabinet members exchanged views on the U.S.-Japan talks and passed more than fifteen domestic plans, including a plan to increase rice production in Taiwan.

Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd - Information Bureau spokesman Kiichi Anami said this morning to foreign news reporters that although the U.S.-Japan talks have quite different viewpoints on both sides, they will continue. When asked about the future of the talks, the spokesman replied, "If there is no hope of compromise, no one would want to continue negotiations. We must wait and see." When asked if Hull's document was an obstacle to the negotiations, the spokesman replied that he was unaware of the Asahi Shimbun's report that the United States intends to close its Japanese consulates if the overall situation worsens. Someone asked if the Japanese government would consider dealing with American consulates in Japan. The spokesman replied, "I don't think so." The spokesman confirmed that the Tatsuta Maru will depart for Los Angeles and Balboa at noon today.

United Press, Tokyo, 2nd - Japanese newspapers today simultaneously published comments expressing pessimism about the final outcome of the Washington Conference. Almost all newspapers believe that the negotiations will fail and say that Japan should prepare to cope with the worst situation. They also advocate taking swift action to deal with the situation in Thailand, which is now clearly a member of the ABCD group. The Kokumin Shimbun said, "We must immediately eliminate the U.S.'s ambition to dominate Asia with retaliatory measures."

United Press, Tokyo, 2nd - Nakano, the leader of the pro-Axis Towa Association, proposed at a mass meeting in Hibiya Park today that the government resort to force if the United States does not recognize the three principles of East Asia. He also demanded that the government take war-like actions, such as sinking American transport ships, if the United States continues to provide aid to Chongqing. Nakano also attacked the government's dispatch of Kurusu to the United States, saying that any compromise between Japan and the United States would lead to Japan's ruin. He also said, "We cannot ignore the current crisis. At present, Britain and the United States are well aware that they are unable to challenge Japan, so we must not allow the Washington talks, motivated by peace, to continue indefinitely." Nakano also said that democratic countries are engaged in propaganda and intimidation in an attempt to complete their anti-Japanese encirclement. He also said, "The United States has no real intention of approaching Japan. If Japan compromises with the United States and gives up southward advance in exchange for American gasoline, then I fear that on the day this agreement is signed, we will see anti-Japanese flames erupt in the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, and Thailand, and Japan's ties with Germany and Italy will be severed."

### British and Indian Armies Reinforce Burma, Eastern Fleet Arrives in Singapore, Including HMS "Prince of Wales," Hong Kong Garrison Massively Deploys Defenses

Reuters, Rangoon, 2nd - Army Headquarters announced that a large number of British and Indian reinforcements have continued to arrive in Rangoon. These troops are well-trained and include several units that can be called the largest batch to have arrived in Burma in the past. They are well-equipped and have the latest equipment, including various vehicles and livestock for transportation, and are ready to go to war upon receiving orders.

Reuters, Rangoon, 2nd - Yesterday, the largest collection of modern military vehicle transportation that Burma has ever seen assembled in Rangoon and left here to be transferred to various defense centers throughout the territory to jointly undertake defense with the original garrison. All the tanks are newly built and are the latest models used by the British army.

Reuters, Singapore, Urgent Dispatch, 2nd - A portion of the British fleet, including several heavy warships, sailed into this port this afternoon. Several warships of the newly established Eastern Fleet have arrived. Among the giant ships is the battleship Prince of Wales. The new commander-in-chief of the Eastern Fleet, Sir Phillips, has hoisted his flag on the Prince of Wales. Other warships of the fleet are also arriving one after another.

United Press, Hong Kong, 2nd - Military authorities announced yesterday that a portion of the Hong Kong garrison is standing at its combat posts. The government issued a special notice urging unnecessary residents to evacuate the area. Military authorities said that a part of the garrison is currently carrying out a "large-scale" deployment on the island. About 1,500 Chinese here have been collecting certificates for typhoid and malaria vaccinations to prepare for evacuation. About 100 Japanese residents left here earlier for Guangzhou.

### Thailand Actively Prepares for War

Reuters, Bangkok, 2nd - The situation here is completely dominated by the future climax of the Far East crisis. Thailand is quietly advancing all self-defense preparations in anticipation of the worst-case scenario. Although those in charge refused to release details, they insisted that the scope of preparations is broad, including all aspects of national defense. It is now believed that the Thai Navy has entered a state of preparation and is patrolling within territorial waters. Military fortresses in Bangkok and their entrances have been garrisoned. Air defense teams are being rushed to various places. According to reliable sources, the authorities are currently collecting all information on private cars and trucks to requisition them in case of emergency. At the same time, there is also news that plans to evacuate women and children from Bangkok are being considered. Domestic defense volunteer teams are registering in various places, but on the other hand, preparations for the "Miss Thailand" pageant, which is the second week of December, are still in full swing and are not affected by the situation.

Reuters, Bangkok, 2nd - Last night, Thai radio announced that the relevant authorities had checked various parts of the Thai border and had not seen any Japanese troops gathered, and that there was no sign of any invasion of Thailand from any direction. The public should believe these words. No one knows our affairs better than we do ourselves.

Reuters, Bangkok, 2nd - When asked by the Japanese Embassy spokesman about reports that the Japanese army will invade Thailand from Vietnam, he replied, "I have not received accurate information, so I cannot comment on this matter. However, the Japanese army has never crossed the Thai border, and I believe it will not do so. This is a fact."

Reuters, Singapore, 2nd - The precautionary plan is being implemented step by step. The formal expression of Japan's threatening attitude has not eased at all, so the preparations of the ABCD countries to cope with the breakdown of peace are being implemented in order. The plan should not be changed until Japan issues a more reliable guarantee of its peaceful intentions. People here also take a cold view of the rumors from Manila and the United States that a Japanese fleet was discovered outside the Japanese-administered islands near Borneo. Those in charge, who have very close ties with the United States, pointed out that this news was transmitted by irresponsible parties in the United States and has not been confirmed by the information obtained here. London also believes that this statement should not be taken lightly. All the manpower in Malaya has now been controlled, and Singaporean volunteers have begun to report for service yesterday.

Reuters, Singapore, 2nd - British Cabinet's Far East representative Duff Cooper said yesterday that Australia, New Zealand, and Britain and the United States are also willing to avoid war with Japan, but like Britain and the United States, they are not prepared to sacrifice their principles or friends in order to seek temporary peace. He was deeply impressed by the observations he made about Australia and New Zealand. The spirit of the people and their dedication to the war effort are great. Regarding his report on the adjustment of British administration in the Far East, both governments agree with his recommendations. He has included other opinions in the telegram and is now awaiting instructions from London.

Reuters, Canberra, 2nd - Australian Prime Minister Curtin said yesterday that war will only occur in the Pacific if the Japanese side takes the offensive. The British Empire has taken steps over the past two years to ensure that it has the physical resources in the area to defend the Empire's territory, so all actions taken are aimed at resisting aggression. The British Empire has no offensive purpose in the Pacific.

Reuters, Rangoon, 2nd - The Commissioner of Civil Defense announced that a blackout drill will be held throughout Burma starting last night.

### Australian 10,000-Ton Cruiser "Sydney" Sinks in Battle After Sinking German Raider, All 600 Crew Members Missing

Reuters, Sydney, 2nd - According to a statement issued by the Australian government today, the Australian Navy's 10,000-ton cruiser Sydney sank in battle after destroying the German armed raider Steiermark. All crew members, including 42 officers and 603 sailors, are now reported missing. The ship sank the German raider with artillery fire, but since then, no information has been received from it, so it must be considered that the ship has now sunk. Aircraft and warships are still conducting extensive reconnaissance in the hope of finding survivors of the ship. Due to military strategy, it was previously inconvenient to publish this news. The loss of this excellent warship and its brave crew is regrettable, but the Australian people are also proud of the ship's ability to maintain the traditional spirit of the Australian Navy and its glorious record in previous battles against the enemy. The Steiermark was known as Raider No. 41 and sailed under the name Kormoran. The Greek ship Antonis and the British ships British Union and African Star were all victims of its violence. The ship then cooperated with another armed merchant ship to sink the British ship Eurylochus. After that, the ship operated in the South Pacific and sank the Agni Thaiti and Eithon in March and April of this year. In June, the two ships Velivit and Mariba were sunk by it between Ceylon and Sumatra. On September 26, the Greek ship Kandiclicos 1 was again victimized.

### Vichy Reiterates Determination to Defend Vietnam and Resist Invasion by Any Country

Havas, Vichy, 1st - A government spokesman said, "If war breaks out in the Pacific, France is determined to continue to defend Vietnam against aggression, regardless of which country the aggression comes from." When asked what attitude France would take if the Japanese army attacked Thailand from its base in Vietnam, the government spokesman replied, "This matter does not seem likely to happen for the time being. Even the Prime Minister of Thailand gave a speech in Bangkok on the 27th of last month, saying that according to reliable news, the Japanese army in Vietnam has no ambition to invade Thailand, nor does the British army in Malaya. Even if this factor changes, the French government will review the new situation in the Pacific based on realistic policies."

### Soviet and Japanese Soldiers Clash Again

The appointment ceremony for the two officials is scheduled to be held in the Imperial Palace today. According to Information Bureau Director-General Tani Masayuki, due to the urgency of the international situation, Foreign Minister Togo was not allowed to concurrently serve as Minister of Colonial Affairs. In view of the importance of the national food problem, Ino will continue to concurrently serve as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry.

### The United States Possesses a Powerful Fleet Sufficient to Handle Two-Ocean Incidents; Knox Publishes an Article Announcing Naval Strength; Gerold Claims Japan Can Be Crushed in Months

Paris, 1st (Havas) – Official announcement: Marshal Pétain today met with German Aviation Minister General Göring in Saint-Florentin, Yonne department, in the German-occupied zone.

Vichy, 1st (Havas) – Pétain and Darlan returned here at 10:30 tonight.

Paris, 2nd (Haitong) – The German Embassy here held an intelligence conference. After the German Ambassador, Abetz, read the official report on the Pétain-Göring talks, Mei, a representative of the French Foreign Ministry, followed.

New York, 2nd (Havas) – Secretary of the Navy Knox recently published an article in a certain magazine, explaining the strength of the U.S. Navy. It is said that the United States today possesses the most powerful fleet in the world. "Whether an incident occurs in one ocean or two, we can handle it with ease. Moreover, due to the expansion of bases in various locations and the construction of a large number of auxiliary ships, the activity of our navy has greatly expanded. As for our strength, we already have seventeen battleships, with fifteen under construction; seven aircraft carriers, with eleven under construction; thirty-seven cruisers, with fifty-four under construction; and one hundred and thirteen destroyers, with seventy-three under construction. The U.S. Navy has a total of 5,800 aircraft of all types, including training aircraft. Once the current military expansion plan is fully realized, the number of naval fighters alone will increase to as many as 15,000. Moreover, the equipment of each aircraft is novel, the speed is high, and the firepower is even greater. In addition, the accuracy of U.S. warships' firing is extremely high. The naval authorities spare no expense and often order each ship to practice target shooting. In the first year of the outbreak of this European war, the U.S. fleet consumed more shells in shooting practice than the British Navy used in combat. This is because British cruisers often do not fire a single shell for several days, while our warships are constantly practicing."

Washington, 2nd (United Press) – Former Minister to Thailand, Mr. Gerold, said yesterday, "If Japan truly wants to fight, this is an opportunity of a lifetime. I believe that our people can crush them with superior naval power within months." He also said that he does not believe Japan currently dares to take actions in the Far East that would cause war, and added, "Japan's past megalomania has only led them to seize opportunities when there is no great danger. If we do not want to allow the Far Eastern door to be closed by Japan, then we must stop Japan. There is no compromise."

Washington, 1st (United Press) – The Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, Mr. May, today urged President Roosevelt to warn Japan that if Japan does not abandon its ambition for a South Asian empire, the United States will bomb Japan by sea and land. Mr. May said that if Japan advances southward, Congress will approve declaring war on Japan now. Americans hate Japan more than Hitler, and said that if American planes can be used to protect the Burma Road, they can also be used to bomb Tokyo.

Washington, 2nd (United Press) – Senator Thomas, a Democratic senator from Utah, said yesterday that the firm stance of the United States can save the Far Eastern situation. He said, "If the United States takes a firm stand, it will be powerful enough to save the situation, because all countries related to the Pacific Ocean, whether in logic or principle, are standing with us. The pressure exerted on Japan is almost equal to war. I believe that the Japanese will have the same observation as the whole world, knowing that the peace of the Far East will be preserved under the wise leadership of the United States."

Editorial

### The Recovery of Rostov

The large army under the command of the Soviet Union's southern route, Timoshenko, began its offensive against the German forces a week ago. After nearly a week of fierce fighting, on the 29th of last month, the key southern route city of Rostov was completely recovered. This news has been officially announced by the Soviet side, and the German side has also acknowledged it.

This is the first important victory for the Soviet army since the German-Soviet war. Of course, this is just a local attempted offensive, and it may not immediately develop into a full-scale and decisive counter-offensive. However, in terms of significance, it at least shows two points: First, the Soviet army has a strong reserve force and has always maintained the strength to turn defense into offense. Second, the Soviet army's supreme commander's strategic command is excellent, and he indeed has the ability to seize opportunities and take the initiative. In the more than five months of fighting since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the recovery of Rostov is indeed a change of face under the situation of the German army's consistent advance and the Soviet army's constant defensive posture, which makes general observers feel refreshed. We can easily imagine that the encouragement of this important victory must have unprecedentedly boosted the morale of the Soviet army. As for the encouragement received by the Allied forces in Europe and the entire anti-aggression front in the world, and the strengthening of confidence in the final victory, it goes without saying.

Needless to say, the actual impact of this victory of the Soviet army in the southern route on the German-Soviet situation is also very significant.

First, it blocked the German army's advance towards the Caucasus head-on. When the German army's second offensive was blocked and the third offensive was launched, its left wing had gathered very strong military strength and equipment and tried its best to rush into Ukraine, occupying several key points in one fell swoop and reaching the Dnieper River. In the fourth offensive, although its main target was Moscow, the southern route's attack has never stopped. As a result, Rostov, a key Soviet industrial, military, and transportation hub, was occupied, reaching the Don River basin and the Donets Basin. In addition to this, it also launched a major battle on the Crimean Peninsula, and within more than a month, it had almost completely occupied all the important points on the island. And the Soviet army's greatest reliance on blocking the German army in Crimea from advancing towards the Caucasus is, of course, the naval power now arrayed in the Sea of Azov and the eight-mile-wide sea surface completely under Soviet control. Therefore, assuming that the German army started from Rostov and advanced directly towards the Baku oil fields and the Caucasus area, which are six hundred miles away, while also advancing south along the coast of the Sea of Azov, then not only would the Caucasus become a direct target of the war; even the Soviet navy now staying in the Sea of Azov would be under serious threat. Therefore, in this counter-offensive by the Soviet army, in addition to recovering Rostov in one fell swoop, it also launched a corresponding counter-offensive in Crimea, forcing the German army to retreat backwards. This at least greatly reduces the threat to the Caucasus in the near future.

More importantly, the German army's pressure on Moscow has also been greatly relaxed due to the Soviet army's recovery of Rostov. This time, the German army's all-out attack on Moscow has been going on for more than two months. Especially in the past ten days or so, the German army has been forced by the situation to face the desolate Soviet wilderness and the long winter, forcing it to do its final onslaught with all its strength near Moscow. However, with the large-scale gathering of the Soviet Moscow garrison and the determination to defend the land, the German army's strength to attack Moscow, if it does not greatly increase fresh troops and equipment, will in no way have any hope of defeating the Soviet army. However, the large number of German troops currently assembled has already created a very serious wintering problem for Hitler. If he now mobilizes fresh troops to launch a fifth offensive, then the problem of how to winter after the number of people increases will be even more serious. This is what Hitler currently considers very depressing. Under such a situation, the development of the war in the Donets Basin area has also had a very significant impact on the gain or loss of Moscow. According to the Soviet side, the German army once attempted to launch a large-scale breakthrough from the Kharkov and Donets River basin area towards the Don River basin, launching an unprecedentedly huge pincer movement against the Moscow area, while attempting to completely cut off the central Soviet army defending Moscow from the Soviet army defending the southern route. If the German army could really realize this attempt, then the threat to the Soviet army would undoubtedly be very serious. However, the Soviet army has now completely seen this point, so it launched an offensive in the southern route, eliminating this potential crisis and relaxing the German army's threat to Moscow.

The size of the forces used by the Soviet army in this southern route offensive has not yet been published with specific figures. And the recovery of Rostov is mostly due to its excellent strategy. It first defeated the German front west of Rostov in one fell swoop from the Donets River basin, putting the German army in the face of the danger of being surrounded and forcing it to retreat quickly. According to the official announcement from the Soviet side, four German divisions were completely annihilated, and another four divisions were completely disorganized. Then, the degree of the intensity of the war can also be imagined. The war is still developing. The German army has retreated to the area of ​​Melitopol, which is one hundred and dozens of miles away. As for whether the German army can stabilize its position here or launch a counter-offensive, it will of course depend on the size of the forces used by the Soviet army this time and the strength of the German reinforcements. This will probably be clear in the next few days.

### Food Procurement to be Completed Within the Year; Procurement in Various Provinces is Not Difficult; There is No Shortage of Military Food and Civilian Food

Chongqing – The total amount of food procured nationwide this year is more than 60 million dan, of which the procurement in the northern provinces is mainly wheat, and it can be completed within the year. According to Food Minister Xu Kan's statement to a Central News Agency reporter on the 1st, after the amount of food procured in each province is stipulated, they have all started to handle it according to the procedure without any difficulty. Of the total of 60 million dan procured, most will be used as military food, and the rest will be distributed to various markets to supply civilian food and to adjust the shortage in grain-deficient provinces. For example, Guangdong and Fujian provinces will be supplied by Hunan and Jiangxi provinces nearby. After this, there is no need to worry about the lack of military food and civilian food nationwide. The local authorities in various provinces are working very hard to handle this matter, and it is expected that all procurement can be completed before the end of the year. Xu continued to talk about the procurement situation in Sichuan Province. It is said that the total amount of commercial procurement in Sichuan Province is 12 million dan. Since the opening of the micro-procurement on September 16, the amount of procurement has reached 8 million dan by the end of November, and the remaining 4 million dan can also be fully procured within the year. This year, about ten counties in eastern and northern Sichuan have suffered poor harvests, but the people are still enthusiastically responding to the procurement, and even after paying the grain, there are no grains left, but they have no complaints. Their enthusiasm for supporting the government is particularly inspiring. (1st dispatch)

### Gansu County System to be Implemented in Stages

Lanzhou – The implementation of the new county system in Gansu Province began in July of last year. The reporter recently inquired Chairman Gu Zhenglun about the situation after a year and a half. He said that since the implementation of the new county system in the province, it has been carried out simultaneously in more than 60 counties in the province. There is a lack of talent and funds, so it is difficult to achieve significant results. Starting this year, in order to concentrate strength and create a model role, the provincial government has made changes according to the actual situation and stipulated that Lanzhou, Lintao, Minxian, Zhangye, Tianshui, Qingyang, etc. Eight counties are the first batch of implementation counties. As of now, this implementation method has achieved the expected results. The funds from the county to the townships have been enriched, and the personnel have also been improved. Recently, a training class has also been established to train office staff in order to equip cadres at all levels with a sound organization and a unified will, so as to achieve the effect of finger and arm coordination. It is expected that after these personnel graduate, the new county system in these eighteen counties can also be completed as scheduled, and it will be easier to promote it to other counties in the future.

### Germany Two Years After the War

The park is full of children's mothers and old people all day long. The young ones are playing ball, and if they are not careful, they will fall on the side of the road.

Will Germany go to war with the United States? When I arrived in Berlin in the autumn of 1940, German officials only said, "It would be extremely foolish for the United States to join the war." But by the late spring of 1941, some officials believed that not only was the Yugoslavian incident and the war with Britain prolonged, but the United States should be fully responsible for it, and that the United States should also be responsible for this European war. They firmly said: Since 1933, Germany has been wary of the conspiracies of the international Jews gathered around Roosevelt, and Poland, France, and Yugoslavia were sacrificed because they mistakenly believed in rumors under the United States' crazy desire to destroy Germany. Some people also said that Britain is just the cat's paw of the United States.

Even the rich rarely wear high-quality leather shoes, let alone the middle class. Of course, they are nowhere to be seen. Ordinary people wear wooden shoes, and walking on the road is like a prototype of Japan. Even privileged classes cannot buy genuine leather shoes, and even imitation leather shoes must be purchased with special permission.

The coffee you drink in the cafe doesn't taste like coffee, and the tea doesn't taste like tea: the ice cream you eat is called "Farbón L.G. Farben (a dye trust)", and the cigarettes you smoke are called "dry grass".

More than half of the women in Berlin make a living by working, but there are a large group of women dressed in fancy clothes along Kurfürstendamm and Unter den Linden. Although there are rumors of forced labor, they don't seem willing to work in factories.

There are many good tennis courts in Berlin, but they are rarely used due to the lack of tennis balls. High-altitude artillery has been installed in the Wensie Golf Club. This year, because there are many members in the army, the scores of the gambling games are not announced, so I don't know which horse is an underdog and which horse is favored by everyone. However, people who are familiar with the inside story know that when it is announced fifteen minutes after the race, the winner must be present in person, and even at a high price, you can't buy golf balls in the country, so it is not very crowded. Most of the people who play golf are Japanese, and most of the people watching on the balcony are upper-class Germans and foreign officials wearing Scottish tweed suits, with blonde and blue-eyed women. The best tip for the club waiters is not money, but cigarettes or food stamps.

Horse races are held as usual. The spectators are still crowded, and their calmness is the same as in other parts of the world, but the actual profit never exceeds the capital by a factor of two, and sometimes it is not even enough to cover the cost. Part of the reason is that the national taxes are heavy, and part of the reason is that the rebates from the racetrack are too high due to the heavy taxes, but there are still many people who gamble.

In the summer, the cafes, golf courses, and racetracks in Berlin are certainly more lively due to the warm weather, but the lives of most Germans who make a living by labor have not changed much. Labor in Germany is not more relaxed in the summer than in the winter, and the working hours are the same. Men work 60 hours a week, and most women work 56 hours.

The monthly allocation of soap is only enough to wash your hands once a day and take a bath once a week, and it is often used up by the end of the third week. Hot water is a luxury, and apartments in the city only have it on Friday and Saturday evenings. It is very difficult for housewives to buy pots, pans, porcelain, and coffee pots. In fact, various household utensils are no longer seen in stores. Even if people have money, they can't buy cameras, telescopes, watches, typewriters, radios, and gold and silver utensils.

The summer days in Germany are very long, and it doesn't get dark until ten o'clock. Most Germans spend their time either taking a walk in the park or having a beer and chatting with each other. They also go to see thunder films in groups, but children with knowledge over the age of eleven or twelve also feel unhappy when they see such films. Operas and dramas are good, but they are too expensive.

May 1st is called National Labor Day in Germany. That labor front swindler Lei said: Our work is so difficult, our achievements are so great, I

One day in early June, I saw three well-dressed children playing together in a park in Berlin. Two four- or five-year-old boys turned their tricycles over and sat between the two rear wheels, holding the front wheel with their hands. They were supposed to be airplane pilots. A girl of about six years old drew a large square frame on the ground near the tricycles. She told them, "This is the airplane field below." She also drew a small square frame in the corner and said, "This is the hangar. The older boy got off the car and drew many crosses in the square frame and said, "These are the airplanes. He and another boy filled a few bags with stones, got on the plane, and threw the stones at the airplane field, shouting loudly when the stones landed! Boom! The airplane field was destroyed," and they began a fierce battle. (To be continued)

### South Route Defeated German Army: Retreat Cut Off by Soviets; Fate of Annihilation in Days; Red Army Gains Much Booty in Rostov Battle

Reuters, London, 2nd: A Kubyshev radio broadcast stated that the fate of the Nazi troops defeated at Rostov has been decided, and they may be annihilated within days. Currently, the scattered remnants of the Nazis are not only being fiercely pursued by the victorious Soviet army, but their retreat has also been cut off. The only remaining escape route for the Germans is to retreat to the Sea of Azov and perish. The radio also stated that the defeated German army has been surrounded by Soviet forces from all directions and is in a desperate situation, being gradually eliminated.

TASS, South Route, 2nd: A correspondent for Izvestia reported that after the Red Army recaptured Rostov, it continued to advance rapidly, retaking many villages and towns each day. The vanguard of the Red Army is now further away from Rostov. The German army is attempting to resist our advance, and fierce battles have broken out in several areas, but our army continues to advance rapidly. Steel-Jacket-Off's troops advanced 30 kilometers in one day, and other units are also rapidly advancing as the enemy continues to retreat in disarray. Our army continues to advance westward, and as of December 1st, our army had advanced another 50 kilometers after recapturing Rostov.

Reuters, Moscow, 2nd: The Soviet Information Bureau stated that in the victory at Rostov, the spoils captured included 28 tanks, 120 artillery pieces, 306 machine guns, 178 grenade launchers, over 4,000 rifles, 871 trucks, and a large amount of other military equipment. 102 enemy aircraft were also shot down. These figures are only preliminary estimates and are not yet complete, as the Soviet army is still engaged in the offensive and has not been able to thoroughly inspect all the spoils.

Reuters, London, 2nd: A Reuters military commentator stated that the situation in the Moscow area is still quite confused. Although newspapers report Soviet victories in Tula, there has been no decisive change. The German side claims to have made some progress northwest of Moscow, but their communiqué lacks conviction. The disposition and strength of the Soviet forces cannot yet be disclosed, but the names of the former commanders of the three fronts are now known. The Leningrad Soviet army, which is now cut off from the central and southern districts, is commanded by General Gusin. The supreme commander in Moscow is General Sukov, assisted by Generals Rokossovsky, Gutorkov, and Chumarkov. Gutorkov and Gutonev are commanders under Zhukov. Marshal Tomusenko is the supreme commander of the southern front, with Lieutenant General Chelevingerko, Generals Remisov, and Karetonov as his deputies.

Northern Route Battles Fierce; German Deaths Numerous

TASS, Galerria, Day Unknown: The battles on the Stenengrad front in the northern route remain extremely fierce. The German "Norton" SS Division recently attacked Loki Station, resulting in a major defeat, with numerous dead and wounded, and corpses littering the battlefield for kilometers. Currently, the battle on the left flank is still in full swing, and our army's fierce counter-offensive is quite successful. The battle for Highland F is extremely fierce. Although the enemy is resisting stubbornly, our army has occupied the eastern part and continues to advance. On the Murmansk front, our army is holding its ground and strengthening defenses. A certain high ground abandoned by the Germans in early November is still under fierce attack by the Finnish army, who are attempting to retake the area, but have failed, losing over 500 men.

Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Denounces Shameless German Lies

TASS, Kubyshev, 2nd: At a reception for foreign journalists, Soviet Deputy Director of Intelligence, Luo Chaevsky, answered reporters' questions, saying, "The recapture of Rostov is neither the first nor the last blow to the German army. At the same time, the Red Army's victory and the defeat of General von Kleist's troops have shattered the myth of the German army's 'invincibility' and prevented the enemy from continuing to advance. After the German defeat, the German command issued absurd communiqués in an attempt to cover it up, claiming that 'the German retreat was aimed at retaliating against the Soviet people with all their might, because the latter had violated international law by attacking the German rear.' This is a pure lie, and such lies only prove the German side's panic. When the German side occupied Rostov, they declared to the outside world that 'the Soviet people warmly welcomed the German army' and regarded the German army as 'liberators.' But in what a short time have these 'liberators' denounced the 'ungrateful' Soviet people of the city. As for the German side's claim that the Soviet people violated international law, it is even more absurd, because if a bandit breaks into a house, the owner cannot be considered to be breaking the law by driving him out."

### North African Axis Forces: Bitter Fighting Achieves Contact; British Encirclement Temporarily Broken; Both Sides Continue Bloody Battles in Three Areas

Reuters, London, 2nd: According to the latest communiqué from the British Middle East forces, fierce fighting continued yesterday in the main battle area of Rechie due to the Axis forces attempting to link up with the Axis troops east of Tobruk and north of Rechie at Chaferan, six or seven miles away, with the tanks and armored vehicles that General Rommel could gather on the Axis side joining the bitter fighting. The Axis forces suffered heavy losses, but contact has been made. At the same time, the British army in the border area continues to annihilate the encircled Axis forces. In yesterday's battle, the British Air Force again provided close support to the ground forces, constantly attacking enemy armored vehicles and mechanized transport units around the Rechie area. In the desert southwest of the main battlefield, the British mechanized forces in Gelo have resumed operations after being re-equipped and refueled. There is currently no new information from the British reconnaissance teams attacking enemy troops south of Benghazi. There are now more enemy aircraft in the skies over Libya, but air supremacy is still in the hands of the British Air Force, as exemplified by the major battle in the skies over Cobi on Sunday, when British aircraft shot down 15 enemy aircraft while only losing 3 of their own. Today's German communiqué mentioned the Libyan campaign, saying that the battles southeast of Tobruk in the past few days have been favorable to the German and Italian armies.

Reuters, London, 2nd: Axis forces in the Rechie area of Cyrenaica briefly broke through the British lines, but the British forces counterattacked, driving them back and re-establishing their positions. The enemy infantry involved in the battle, likely German soldiers, arrived by truck about four days ago and infiltrated the British lines from the east to assist the enemy 15th Armored Division advancing from the west. Fierce fighting continues in this area. Although more enemy aircraft are appearing in the skies over the Libyan triangle war zone, the British Air Force still maintains air supremacy, as demonstrated by the downing of 18 enemy aircraft in the aerial battle over Cobi on Sunday. British aircraft not only protect the ground forces, but also search for and attack Axis aircraft to prevent them from launching attacks. Cairo officials stated that from the start of the Libyan offensive at dawn on November 18 to midnight on November 30, 176 enemy aircraft in North Africa have been destroyed, of which 90 were shot down in the air, and the British have suffered significant losses.

Reuters, London, 2nd: A Reuters correspondent in the 8th Army on the northern front reported that attacks and counterattacks continue in the Rechie area. The German army has launched an offensive, apparently attempting to cut off the British forces in the area from the main British forces in the Tobruk area. Yesterday's battle can be likened to a sandwich, with the German army being the sausage in between two slices of bread, and the British army being the fingers holding the two sides of the sandwich, holding tighter and tighter. The outcome is not yet apparent. According to a communiqué from the British Middle East Command, the battle in Cyrenaica is now divided into three main areas: (1) the main front southeast of Tobruk, where the British forces advancing from the southeast have linked up with the British forces who have successfully attacked from the Tobruk fortress; (2) the border area from Heerfa to positions north of Omar; (3) the southwest of the Gello area, from Toutou to the main front of Rechie and Hammet. Heavy fighting all day last Sunday, with the enemy attacking from the southwest in the morning and being repelled by the British armored forces south of Rechie.

### U.S. Advises Individual Evacuations; Batch of British Nationals Leaves Shanghai Today; Three British Ships Have Already Left Southward with Nationals; Dozens of U.S. Citizens Take French Ship to Philippines; Rumors of a Shutdown at British Merchant Shipping Company

Nearly 200 British nationals, mostly women and children, left Shanghai at 12:00 noon today on the British evacuation ship Anhui, bound for Singapore via Hong Kong. The number of passengers is the same as on ordinary ships. Those in first and second class are older and unable to withstand the rigors of the journey. Among the evacuating British nationals are many Indians, most of whom will disembark in Hong Kong and transfer to ships bound for Australia. The Indian nationals are going to Calcutta. Luggage was loaded onto the ship at Taikoo Wharf yesterday. According to yesterday's notice from the British Consul-General, Indian nationals were required to board the ship at 9:00 this morning, and British nationals were required to board the ship before 11:00. The ship weighed anchor and left Shanghai at 2:00 PM.

British and American Evacuations Continue Actively

Although there are reports of continued negotiations between the United States and Japan, the British and American evacuations of nationals residing in the occupied areas of China continue actively and have not been relaxed. The Taikoo Company's Liangzhou ship left Shanghai southward yesterday afternoon, and the Yuezhou ship also weighed anchor at 10:00 last night, carrying British nationals to Hong Kong. The Anhui ship is carrying more than 200 British nationals and left for Hong Kong and Singapore this afternoon. The Jardine Matheson's Yisheng and Fusheng ships, coming to Shanghai from Hong Kong, were expected to arrive last Saturday, but as late as this Monday, they had not yet arrived in Shanghai. When asked about this, the company said that heavy fog was slowing their progress and that they would probably arrive yesterday morning. However, as of yesterday evening, the two ships had still not arrived. The company has no information, so it is uncertain whether these two ships will arrive. In addition, the French Company's postal ship General Joffre is scheduled to leave this morning at 8:00 AM, returning to Vietnam via Luzon. A group of about 60 to 70 U.S. citizens are taking this postal ship to the Philippines to return to the United States.

Rumors of a Shutdown at British Company

It is rumored that British Merchant Steam Navigation Company, the largest shipping agency in the Far East, will only send its ships as far as Hong Kong, and will not come to Shanghai for nearly a year. Therefore, in addition to handling transit goods, the company has reduced its work. Chinese staff are being laid off one after another, and there are recent rumors of a complete shutdown. However, the company has not yet made a formal announcement.

It has been reported that the U.S. Consulate-General in Shanghai yesterday urgently advised the more than 2,500 U.S. citizens in Shanghai and the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui (all within the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Consulate) to leave the country unless absolutely necessary. The U.S. Consulate-General recently announced the evacuation of U.S. citizens through newspapers, but the advice issued yesterday was sent to individual U.S. citizens or families, and is the latest recommendation from the U.S. and British authorities for citizens to evacuate due to the dense war clouds in the East. According to consulate statistics, there are currently about 2,500 U.S. citizens in the Shanghai consulate district, including 450 to 500 Filipinos. 2,400 live in Shanghai, and only 100 to 125 are scattered in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui.

It is also reported that gasoline must be further reduced and consumption restricted due to the need to provide more difficult supplies. The four major gasoline companies issued a joint notice yesterday stating that from December 1st, the existing gasoline allocation certificates will be reduced by 50% at the next allocation. The four major companies include Asia, Mobil, Swiss-American, and Guanghua. The notice also stated that any requests for increased allocation will be rejected.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Moves Police Authority to Northern District of Suzhou Creek: Additional 300 Police Officers Sent to Serve, but Subordinate to Japanese Police District Chief

Negotiations on this matter have been intermittent, and now it has been announced that the process is complete amidst talk of "changing the police department's structure," which is being closely watched by all parties.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Flour Sales: Price of Each Bag is 40 Yuan; Still Plans to Reduce it to 36 Yuan per Bag; Rice and Coal Supply; Banks Guarantee Cooperation

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Announcement No. 5625, stating that from the 3rd to the 9th of this month, the Council's Rice Office will temporarily suspend the sale of foreign rice for one week.

Council Flour Sales Still Plan to Lower Price

Yesterday morning, the Municipal Council began selling flour at the Municipal Council building to reputable merchants such as bakeries and noodle shops at a price of 40 yuan per bag. The Council has also formulated a plan to take firm action to limit the price of flour to about 36 yuan per bag. The Council will first register all flour stocks in the Public Concession, and then find a number of bags of flour in the city. After the work is completed, the Council's Price Control Office will begin selling flour to reputable merchants. It is reported that yesterday morning, those who went to the Council building to buy flour far exceeded the amount of flour obtained by the Council.

Conference Today to Limit Price and Dump

With the first stage of the Municipal Council's lowering of flour prices completed, a conference is scheduled to be held today to formulate the second stage of the process. In order to preserve the flour stocks within the Concession, the Council may implement the same regulations as those for rice, that is, purchase a large amount of flour and then dump it on the market at a limited price, and prohibit those who do not have a special permit from transporting it out of the Public Concession. The fourth batch of flour ordered by the Municipal Council through importers in this city, totaling 64,000 bags, is expected to arrive in Shanghai in the latter half of this month. The fifth batch of 12,000 bags is expected to be shipped to Shanghai in January. A responsible person from the Municipal Council recently denied the rumors that the Council had ordered rice from Thailand to be shipped to Shanghai. It is said that the Council will consider various proposals for selling rice, including those from Thailand, but has not formulated a definite plan to purchase rice from Thailand.

Make Every Effort to Lower the Cost of Living

The Municipal Council held a routine meeting yesterday to discuss various aspects of the city's economic situation. The Coal Committee also met to thoroughly discuss issues such as the import of coal, paying close attention to the two points of freight and shipping convenience. The Council is working hard to lower the high cost of living. Although it encounters various difficulties, there are also reasons for optimism, namely that the various banks and insurance companies have guaranteed the authorities their wholehearted cooperation. Each bank will report monthly details of its rice purchase assistance, such as the names of the rice purchasers and the quantities purchased. Each insurance company will report the amount of rice insured to it. Another welcome development is that the organization of the Municipal Council's Price Control Office is more effective, and a flour office has been added. It is also learned that the Municipal Council has been studying the issue of coal for a long time, and has transferred Teef, a specialist from the Works Department, to the Price Control Office to handle coal issues. It is rumored that the Municipal Council has already prepared to sell the flour in the Puxi warehouses.

Rice Supply Also Available in West Shanghai

The Municipal Council has decided that residents in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads Area can purchase foreign rice, starting today (3rd), and will set up a temporary foreign rice retail outlet at the intersection of Great Western Road and Edinburgh Road, selling Municipal Council foreign rice, limited to one dou per person.

### All Banks Have Unlimited Liability for Savings Deposits - Most Chinese and Foreign Banks Are Unwilling to Follow the Temporary Measures of Datong Bank This Time

### Engineers Association Decides to Promote Industrial Standardization - Engineering Societies Establish Committees

(Guiyang Hangxun) At the tenth annual meeting of the Chinese Engineers Association, the discussion on the issue of "Industrial Standardization" concluded on the third day of the conference. The conference was held at the Southwest Highway Zhongshan Hall, with more than 50 experts attending. First, Chairman Ouyang Lun reported on the promotion of industrialization in our country, followed by Wu Chengluo's report on the regulation of the metrology system in our country, and Gu Yu's report on the central industrial test site for the standardization of chemistry, electricity, materials, and machinery. Then, a discussion began on Yun Zhen's proposal to first seek to solve the difficulties of standardization and the methods of promotion in the future. Yun offered three points of opinion on the promotion method: the supply side, the application side, and the government and academic group side should jointly formulate a draft standard to carry out a large-scale standardization movement to arouse general attention and awareness. The above proposals were passed by the whole body, and the chairman proposed the proposal of the board of directors last year to organize the Chinese Engineering Standards Promotion Association. It was resolved that the association should draft the articles of association and proceed independently, and closely cooperate with the competent authorities and the engineering standards committees of various specialized associations and related groups. The final conclusion is that industrial standardization is very important for the future completion of the defense industry. The association should establish an industrial standards promotion association in the future to actively promote the industrial standardization movement by contacting public and private institutions and organizations, and to obtain contact with consumers, manufacturers, and distributors at any time. After the conference, engineering societies such as water conservancy, machinery, civil engineering, chemistry, mining, metallurgy, and electrical engineering all held separate meetings and unanimously established engineering standards committees for each department.

### London Chinese Government Bonds Soar: Domestic Bonds Begin to Recover but Remain Weak

London, 1st (Monday) Telegram: Today's listing of Chinese foreign bonds and stocks of British and American companies in the Far East shows a rise in Chinese government bonds. Crisp and Reorganization (British-French) bonds from the previous period each rose by 5 pounds, with the former at 37 pounds and the latter at 43 and a half pounds. Sino-French American Dollar and British-French (British-French) bonds each rose by 4 pounds, with the former at 51 pounds and the latter at 52 pounds. British-German Continuing (British-French) bonds rose by 3 pounds, to 53 pounds, and British-Kexin rose by 1 pound, to 15 pounds. Among the railway bonds from the previous period, Daoqing, Jinpu Original Continuing, and Guangjiu each rose by 3 pounds, with Daoqing at 20 pounds and Jinpu and Guangjiu each at 18 pounds. Hukwang Non-German-French bonds rose by 1 pound, to 19 pounds. The rest each rose by 2 pounds, with Beining at 72 pounds, Hukwang German-French and Longhai at 17 pounds, and Jinghu at 10 pounds. As for British stocks, only HSBC shares showed a downward trend, with London registered shares falling by 2 and a half pounds, to 75 pounds, and Hong Kong registered shares falling by 2 pounds, to 83 pounds, with trading inactive. There were no other changes.

Although the unofficial bond market showed a slight recovery yesterday, it still felt weak. Typically, during rebounds, trading becomes active, but yesterday's trading actually decreased significantly, indicating that people were still focused on the US-Japan negotiations. At the opening yesterday morning, Runde and Renfeng made purchases, but they were unable to push prices up. Type C bonds failed to reach 8 yuan from morning to evening, and Type E bonds, although approaching the lottery draw, only rose by 5 fen. Because Lianyi, Yuxing, and Hongda were selling, the market still felt unable to rise. In the afternoon, Tongkang and Gongmao made purchases, while Lianyi continued to sell. Yitai also sold off, and the market remained flat, with trading significantly reduced. As a result, except for Type D bonds, which rose by 5 jiao due to small openings in the past two days, the rest rose by 5 fen to 8 jiao. The volume of transactions was approximately 1.3 million yuan. A summary table is provided below.

Stock trading: 100 shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded at a price of 130 yuan each.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's stock market opened with firm prices, and short sellers made slight replenishments after the opening. However, due to the significant gains already made and the lack of definite progress in the situation, most operators were watching and waiting, so the market remained range-bound with no major fluctuations.

### Yarn Loses Momentum: Floating with the Market, Buying High and Selling Low

The yarn market rose and then fell, but the situation remained volatile. In reality, people sell when prices are high and buy when prices are low, so the current situation is still in flux. Major players buy when prices are low, while general retail investors view existing yarn as non-tradable and tend to sell. The highest price for 20s Double Horse yarn was 2,550 yuan, and the lowest price was 2,435 yuan.

Double Horse yarn opened in the morning, continuing the firm and bullish momentum from the previous day. The opening price was 2,515 yuan, and many people were covering their short positions. Shortly after, it rose to 2,550 yuan. Later, the price of the second session on the exchange fell, and market sentiment weakened, leading to more sellers. It fell to 2,480 yuan, but as prices fell, profit-takers began to cover their short positions again, pushing the price up to 2,565 yuan. However, the large players secretly sold off their holdings, causing the chips to loosen. As the market neared closing, it gradually declined, closing at 2,470 yuan. It was found that the transaction volume in the morning half-day totaled 2,850 bales. The afternoon situation was lackluster. The opening price was 2,460 yuan, and it rose slightly to 2,475 yuan. Suddenly, it was heard that the exchange price was loosening, and it fell back to close at 2,435 yuan.

The futures market for Gold Double Horse yarn was volatile and suddenly returned to a sluggish state. This was because the negotiations between the US and Japan had not shown any significant progress, and the overall situation had not been followed up with good news. Therefore, the general sentiment had not improved significantly. In addition, the unusually tight money supply greatly weakened the potential of the long positions. Although the market rose rapidly after each positive stimulus, it did not rise as much as it fell, indicating that the foundations of the yarn market were not yet solid. At the initial opening in the morning, the futures market for yarn was invigorated by the continued rise in the gold market and spot yarn prices, and there was a scramble to buy, especially among short sellers covering their positions. Therefore, the December contract opened at a high price of 2,570 yuan, rising by another 70 yuan. The January contract opened at 2,615 yuan, also up by 56 yuan. When the February contract opened, it coincided with the softening of factory orders, and there was already a downward trend. After entering, it continued to be weak, and by the afternoon, it had fallen by 30 to 50 yuan. Although the factory orders and the exchange were extremely volatile in the afternoon, the futures yarn was still stable, and although there was a low price for the day, the closing was considered firm. As a result of the seven rises and falls throughout the day, the contracts for each month were down by slightly less than 40 yuan. A table is provided below:

December January February

The situation for spot cotton was mediocre, but the majority of the market was watching and waiting for an opportunity to move.

The New York cotton market was volatile, rising and falling. It fell first due to the dangerous situation in the Far East, but then rose slightly due to purchases by brokers and short covering. As a result, the closing price rose or fell by two or three basis points compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market fell first due to cotton merchants selling short again, but then rose again due to purchases by speculators and the firm stock market. Yesterday's closing price rose by about one rupee each. It is predicted that the market will open lower by one and a half rupees today due to very bad political news.

### Rice Weevils Stirring, Mill Noodles: Uneven Joy and Sorrow

The Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign rice: yesterday afternoon, the Taikoo Company's ship Beihai arrived in port with 10,200 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and it docked at Wharf No. 4 of the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. A portion of Shanghai's rice merchants, especially rice dealers and large-scale hoarders, are making a final struggle, hoping to restore the rice market. Their rationale is, of course, related to the livelihood of a small number of people, but in reality, they want to destroy the Municipal Council's control. If the market can be opened, prices can rise and fall, and the Municipal Council's price limits will become a dead letter. This is their insidious and clever tactic. It is thought that the Municipal Council will never be deceived and will not abandon their efforts halfway, so that they will not be criticized for abandoning their responsibilities. Therefore, the national rice market did not open yesterday, which was a silent demonstration of passive resistance by the rice merchants against the government.

Yesterday's foreign noodle market was slightly lively, because the actual retail customers on this street had not been able to buy smoothly for a long time, and the demand gradually increased. The purchasing appetite of customers from other regions and hoarders was also good. However, those who held the goods were still willing to sell. Generally, retail investors, seeing that the market had sufficient supplies, that Hong Kong noodles were about to arrive, and that the current situation was volatile, believed that hoarding noodles was a long-term risk, so they mostly sought to sell at market prices. Therefore, supply and demand were evenly matched, and the market remained balanced. Dongzhan's Jinlong noodles were priced at 51-52 yuan, and Dongzhan's Australian noodle Bell Tower brand was priced at 54 and a half yuan. The imported registered noodles from Xizhan, Jinlong brand, were priced at 40 yuan and 39 and a half yuan, and cannonball noodles were priced at 41 yuan to 40 yuan, all similar to the previous market. However, wheat bran was selling well due to shortages.

### Bankers Unleashed: Gold Market's Rise Declines Again

Yesterday, the spot gold market initially rose and then fell. After repeatedly breaking through the 15,000 yuan mark, it immediately fell back. People were confused, as the US-Japan negotiations were approaching their final stage, and the future changes were still difficult to predict. Although Chen Ji and the goldsmiths had a good appetite, the banks and cash shops competed to sell, and the price immediately fell back after reaching 15,400 yuan, retreating to 14,300 yuan. In the end, it was 370 yuan lower. The total transaction volume for the day was approximately 23,000 taels.

Spot prices rise first, then fall.

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) continued the upward momentum from the previous day, suddenly breaking out of the 15,000 yuan mark. Opening at 9:00 AM at 15,100 yuan, the opening was 300 yuan higher, reaching 19,400 yuan. Xianghe, Shunyuan, and Tongkangyong cash shops sold continuously, and Tianyuan and securities brokers also sold, immediately causing a 600 yuan decline, retreating to 14,800 yuan. Chengji, Decheng, and Mingfeng absorbed the supply, raising the price to around 15,000 yuan for a long time, once rising to 15,200 yuan. At noon, Xianghe, Shunyuan, Gonghe, Xiangxingyong, and Hesheng continued to sell without stopping, and the price gradually declined and could not recover, retreating to 14,480 yuan at the noon close, at 14,530 yuan. The market opened strong at 2:00 PM, raising the price by 270 yuan, to 14,800 yuan. Xianghe, Yongcheng, securities brokers, Wanfeng, and Tian兀 took turns to sell forcefully, and the price gradually fell by 500 yuan, dropping to a low price of 14,300 yuan. Xianghe, Mingfeng, and Chengji entered forcefully, slightly raising the price, closing at 14,430 yuan, which was 370 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day, with a difference of 1,100 yuan. The retail price of gold from the cash shops was 14,600 yuan, with the purchase price about 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.

Jewelry falls 50 yuan

The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael opened at 50 yuan higher in the morning, at 1,570 yuan, but then suddenly fell three times, lowering the price by 100 yuan, finally reaching 1,470 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by 150 yuan), down by 50 yuan. The price of silver remained at 22 yuan, and the black market price was 17 yuan, with a transaction volume of 500 to 600 taels.

### Chinese Merchants Bullish on Black Market Foreign Exchange: Unwilling to Supply Unless at High Prices, British Gold Notes Suddenly Plummet

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the central bank and HSBC posting prices as before, and the prices at the smaller counters of HSBC, etc., were also flat. The black market for British and American exchange continued to soften. Although importing foreign firms rarely made purchases, sellers had disappeared due to the soaring spot prices the day before. Chinese merchants were only willing to supply at bullish prices, asking for 2.375 yuan for British exchange and 3.5 yuan for US dollars. No transactions were made throughout the day. The price was 0.0625 yuan tighter than the previous British exchange and 0.125 yuan tighter than the previous US dollar.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds fall, with spot prices falling by 10 yuan each. British gold notes suddenly plummeted, retreating to 60 yuan in the evening market. US gold notes were high at 29 yuan in the morning, with a final price of 28.5 yuan, up 2 jiao from the previous day. Hong Kong notes also tended to soften, retreating to 6.4 yuan in the evening market. Japanese gold notes and military notes also declined, with the former retreating to 2.8 yuan and the latter falling to 3.46 yuan.

Hong Kong, 2nd (Tuesday) Telegram: The foreign exchange market opened calmly this morning, with all exchanges showing no gains or losses.

Tianjin, 2nd (Tuesday) Telegram: The foreign exchange market opened flat this morning, with no change in the London and New York telegraphic transfers. There were prices but no buyers. The Shanghai exchange also remained at its original level. The unofficial price of the Federal Reserve note fell by 2.5 jiao to 49.25 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Fluctuations Narrowing

Factory cloth: The market initially rose seven times in the morning, but then immediately fell. This was because retail sales were sluggish, and factories and traders sold off at high prices. Yihua and Zhenzhong factories opened sales of rental cloth in various grades for recent contracts, making it difficult for cloth prices to rise. The fluctuations were even smaller in the afternoon. As a result, the prices rose or fell by 0.25 to 0.5 jiao compared to the previous day. Approximately 200 pieces of coarse cloth and flannel were traded on this street, and Zhejiang dealers handled 50 to 60 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth.

Dong cloth: The market initially rose and then fell, with the range of increases and decreases gradually narrowing. Therefore, the market trend turned stable. The opening price of the exchange's colored ball fine cloth futures rose by 5 jiao, but then fell following the decline in yarn prices. The closing price for this month was 85 yuan, down by 1.5 yuan. January was at 88 yuan, and February was at 89.5 yuan, both down by 1 yuan. The closing price for leading fine cloth factory orders was 90 yuan, down by 2 yuan. The closing price for Four Gentlemen serge was 3.3 yuan, also down by 7 fen.

### Sugar Market Returns Downward

Declines range from 12 yuan to 4 yuan. Yesterday, the sugar market weakened due to the seemingly eased US-Japan situation. The bullish mood of the previous market was fleeting, and trading was quiet. The total number of contracts traded was only about 6,000 bags, and spot goods were only about 5,000 bags. For example, the futures contract for 24 coarse white sugar companies opened at 206 yuan to 202 yuan in the morning, but fell below the 200 yuan mark in the afternoon, to 197 yuan to 199 yuan, down by 8.5 yuan from the previous market. The 20th contract was at 212 yuan to 211 yuan in the morning and 206.5 yuan in the afternoon, returning to a high of 9 yuan. As a result, it fell slightly by 9 yuan. The import of spot goods in November was 214 yuan to 208.5 yuan in the morning.

### Bean Oil: Mixed

Yesterday's miscellaneous grains market was mixed. The price of cooking oil rose by around 10 yuan due to the reduction in inventory and the bullishness of the cargo owners. Soybeans continued to rise by 2-3 yuan due to the continuous appetite of customers from other regions. Corn initially firmed due to the efforts of customers from other regions, but then declined as profit-taking hoarders dumped their holdings, resulting in a decline of 1-2 yuan compared to the previous day. Sales opened for 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 300 cans of Jiangbei raw oil, over 100 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 800 dan of Dayou factory clear oil, over 200 barrels of Rihua factory vegetable oil, 400 bags of Tianjin Xinjinyuan, and 200 bags of green beans. There were over 2,000 bags of spot corn, and 700 tons from Yinghua Company.

### Dealing with Housing Disputes

— Ping Ye

The efforts of the concession authorities to stabilize the prices of daily necessities have been successful, and we believe that they are also considering the issue of housing for citizens. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the concession authorities had studied the rent issue, but the proposed solutions involved legal matters, making progress difficult. However, we believe that this does not mean that they are unable to stop the exorbitant rent increases. Laws are based on human considerations, and price increases that go beyond human considerations and threaten the housing security of citizens also affect public safety. Therefore, our opinion is to be lenient with the past and strict with the future. As long as they can establish a method that balances emotions and reality, they can at least stabilize the soaring rental prices.

We believe that to solve the pressure of rent increases that most common people suffer from, the following short-term measures can be taken: (1) After the measures are announced, all rental contracts signed by second landlords and third tenants shall remain as they were. After that, if a second landlord needs to increase the rent, they must report the reasons for the increase (such as increased water fees or property taxes) to the relevant department of the concession authorities. After review and confirmation that the reasons are valid, the rent may be appropriately increased. The same applies if the landlord requests a rent increase when the rental contract expires and is renewed. The landlord must not secretly contact a third party to replace the tenant. If the second landlord claims that they are taking back the property for their own use, they must also report the reasons and await review. If the rental contract has not expired, the landlord must not claim that they are taking back the property for their own use, requesting the tenant to move out, unless otherwise stipulated in the contract. (2) In the case of selling subdivided housing, even if the landlord changes, the original tenants cannot be changed, and the rent cannot be increased. The name of the landlord in the contract can be changed, but the wording of the original contract cannot be changed. (3) Hereafter, when a landlord rents out a house, they must not collect any fees under the name of small rent or other similar names. Tenants may voluntarily pay a small amount of repair fees, but it should not exceed a few yuan per room. (4) If a tenant requests to continue renting one month before the expiration of the contract, they may continue to rent at the original rent. (5) Those who violate various regulations shall be fined. Those who extort tips or order tenants to move out shall be severely punished.

We have received letters from all walks of life appealing for the issue of rent, almost like a mountain. At the same time, some people have sent letters advocating a compromise solution, so that the second landlords do not leave the houses empty without renting them out, or sublet them to relatives and friends, leaving those who have no relatives almost without a place to stay. In fact, as long as there is a fair solution for extortion of tips or forced relocation, the housing problem will not become thorny. We are convinced that the concession authorities have been able to establish a good atmosphere in the difficult work of stabilizing the prices of daily necessities. This housing problem, which seems complicated but is actually simpler than the issue of daily necessities, will surely be successfully resolved by the concession authorities in a reasonable amount of time. This is what we can say with certainty.

### Housing and Living · Moving and Rent Increases

— Fang Yang

The landlord’s son said he was getting married next month. The landlady came to discuss, saying, "Move back to your own place a month early, so you can find a new one!" The words were as pleasant as could be. But finding a south-facing unit for forty-five dollars a month? Where would one find that?

In fact, the rent I pay monthly already covers the entire expenses of the landlord's house. They live in the entire lower level for free, and also earn thirty-six dollars from the three-story building and twenty-two dollars from the attic room. Yet, they are already calculating on my head, an "old tenant"—the son's marriage is a pretense, but wanting me to move is the truth.

Moreover, I heard that once the old tenant leaves, they can collect a small "key money" or deposit of one or two thousand dollars from the new tenant.

In the end, someone was sent to tell me they would give me three months' "moving expenses." However, we have decided this:

"Everyone go out and find a place. As long as the conditions (including rent, accessibility, etc.) are suitable, ask the landlord to help us move to the new place, and that's it. As for myself, I absolutely will not take a single copper."

Thus began my "house-hunting" life. —Seeing the landlady's lifeless face every day is truly boring. I decided to go out and see what the outside "housing market" is really like.

I ran around to quite a few places, but was rejected because of these conditions:

"How many people are there in your family? We don't rent to families with children!" I told them there were three of us, and they almost shook their heads off. They repeatedly said, "No rent, no rent!"

This really baffled me. Isn't the country "encouraging childbirth"? Isn't China boasting to the world about its large population? But why are the landlords in Shanghai opposing people "having children"? Are they afraid that others' children will snatch away their "property," and hope that people will "die childless and without descendants"?

That's one reason, but many others scared me away with conditions like thousands of dollars in "key money," several months' deposit, and paying five years' rent in advance.

So, I have no choice but to stay in that house, enduring the landlord's anger. Moreover, I have been enduring "scolding the daughter to teach the daughter-in-law" every day for two months, and still haven't found a new place! (Their son's "wedding" had to be postponed.)

I don't understand any of this. The price of goods in the Seven Seas can be controlled, so why are the landlords in Shanghai still allowed to be so arrogant today?

### Collection of Profound Opinions

— Compiled by University Students

Some university professors in Shanghai, in addition to lecturing, routinely love to utter profound opinions, covering everything from the vastness of the universe to the minutiae of flies. Now, let us record a few examples below to amuse the readers.

The Leapfrog Theory

According to a certain professor, it is fortunate that China's railway and highway transportation are not well-developed, because the most convenient means of transportation today is the airplane; railways and highways are outdated. The United States has railways and highways crisscrossing the country, which are almost useless. China can skip the railway and highway stage and directly utilize airplanes. In fact, we can wait another eighteen hundred years. If humanity does not perish and progress does not stop, there will surely be more convenient means of transportation than airplanes in the future. Wouldn't we be able to leap even further if we wait a few hundred years, or even a few thousand years? What do you think, Professor?

A Profound Lesson

Since one is a professor, one must have "gilded" oneself; since one has gilded oneself, one must say, "When I was in the United States..." And the most profound lesson that our great professor learned when he was in the United States was the following:

When our great professor was about to return home, his foreign teacher gave him this famous saying: "You can take anything back with you, but by no means take American machines with you; the United States has suffered from machines, and your Eastern spiritual civilization is great." If this foreign teacher knew how diligently his student was spreading his famous saying, he would surely say with joy, "This child is teachable." If Ah Q were executed by shooting, he could also smile in the afterlife; if he were resurrected again, he would say, "My doctrine is not isolated."

### Revitalizing Business Ethics

— Jing Cun

Before the war, the business community in Shanghai had made efforts to advocate for the cultivation and training of employees. At that time, I knew that many companies and shops ran their own training classes or subsidized employees' supplementary schools. Since the outbreak of war, industry and commerce have been hit hardest, and the work of training employees has also been suspended. After the war moved inland and the population concentrated in Shanghai, various industries showed a booming atmosphere again. Although business is booming, the service ethics of commercial employees seem to be less satisfactory than before the war. This is really something that the business community must pay attention to. Recently, I had the opportunity to visit the He Ming shoe store and had several in-depth conversations with its owner. I feel that the training of his employees is truly admirable.

In general shoe stores in Shanghai, the clerks are mostly apprentices. He Ming recruits middle school students and then provides them with vocational training. Therefore, they treat customers with courtesy and kindness, giving people a good impression. After work every day, the manager leads them in various extracurricular activities, such as knowledge lectures on Mondays, family worship on Wednesdays, and ball games on Fridays. They also invite celebrities to give lectures from time to time to instill the knowledge necessary for young people. It is also said that a business youth association will soon be established to provide employees with full training in moral, intellectual, physical, and social development. All extracurricular organizations or activities of the store are attended unanimously, without distinction between managers and employees. Therefore, they are usually harmonious, advising each other well and correcting each other's faults. Among the industrial and commercial firms I know well, He Ming is one that I consider to have the most promising future.

It is really necessary to revitalize business ethics in Shanghai after the war, especially today. Aside from "making money," the business community does not talk about service. For example, the repeated price increases cannot be said to be necessary. Everyone raises prices in a frenzy, but as far as I know, He Ming's prices are raised later than others. If everyone did that, prices would not rise like a runaway horse.

### Chinese Flowering Crabapple

— Qin Shouou

Fifteen. Father, let's go busking!

"When will this situation improve?" Mei Bao asked, looking up at the face of this great editor, her brows furrowed with worry.

Qian Ruomo hesitated for a full four or five minutes before answering.

"It's hard to say." He exhaled a mouthful of smoke, tilted his head, and looked at the overcast sky. "Before the dawn, everyone can only endure some suffering!"

Mei Bao already understood the situation in Shanghai in recent days, but she didn't know how serious it was until she saw Qian Ruomo's expression at this moment.

Unfortunately, this situation became more serious day by day. By the time Qiu Haitang recovered from his illness and got out of bed, Shanghai had become another world. Qian Ruomo had left, and before leaving, he sent them fifty dollars and a short note, stating that he was leaving Shanghai to go to Sichuan due to his job, and hoping that Mei Bao and her father could also slowly find a way to go to the southwest.

Zhang Yincai also came several times, and told Qiu Haitang that he had transferred to the newly opened Rong Stage to be in charge of martial arts. As long as Qiu Haitang's voice was good enough, he could help him get a role as an old male character.

But this time, Mei Bao didn't want to let her father go out and sell his old bones anymore. (278)

### Greer Garson's Reason for Acting as a Mother with a Loving Heart

— Yi Fan

"Mrs. Miniver," currently showing at the Grand China Theater, marks Greer Garson's first appearance in a color film. In "Mrs. Miniver," she plays the superintendent of a Texas orphanage, showing her loving heart for children. Before Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer produced this film, they spent some time choosing the leading role, and eventually found that Miss Garson was the only suitable actress in Hollywood.

This blonde, blue-eyed Irish woman knew that playing this role would not be easy, but she decided to take it on and work for the happiness of children around the world. As for why she was chosen and suitable for the leading role in "Mrs. Miniver," there is also a reason.

Like other Irish people, Greer Garson entered school at a young age. But from elementary school to graduation from the University of London, she relied on scholarships to advance through these three stages. Of course, after graduation, she became a teacher, fulfilling her responsibility for education. Soon, she was introduced to a research institute by an advertising company in London. Later, she was introduced to a music academy in Birmingham. The first play she performed was Shaw's famous work, and from then on, she decided to dedicate herself to entertainment. Her famous work was the film "Golden Arrow."

After acting in the film "Goodbye, Mr. Chips," she was introduced to Hollywood to develop her career. Her first film in the United States was "Blossoms in the Dust," which received praise from the education community. She co-starred with Ronald Colman in Remember. She was also the leading actress in "Pride and Prejudice." Now she appears in the color film "Mrs. Miniver," playing the lover of two thousand children. With the influence she received in her childhood and the experience she gained in education after graduation, her success can be imagined. After seeing it, people in Shanghai may have a little "loving heart for children."

### The First Day a New Actor Takes the Stage

— Zhi Yu

Li Shaochun has returned from gilding himself in Peking and made a grand debut at the Tianchan. The opening day's performance was "Striking the Drum and Scolding Cao Cao" and "Two Generals," one civil and one military. The plays were so brand-new! When I arrived, Li Peifang was singing "June Snow," followed by Ban Shichao's "Peach Blossom Festival," a big fight, which was not weak compared to Yan Shishan. Xiaba Bai Yuanjie, a young lad who looked to be about ten years old, was quite good! Because it was the first day, he put in extra effort. Zhang Haichen's "Taking Luoyang" was average. Then came Bai Yuwei's "Spring Boudoir." As soon as Bai Yuwei appeared, she charmed the whole house. Her makeup was as beautiful as her name. Her expression was quite realistic, probably because a young girl was playing a young girl. The pity is that her voice is not bright, so many good tunes can only be enjoyed by the audience in the front row.

Li Shaochun's "Scolding Cao Cao" took the stage. His opening line was full of charm. A voice filled the hall, "A lifetime of ambition..." Every line of the singing was enjoyable. The sound of the drum, using the phrase "big pearls and small pearls falling on a jade plate" to describe it, would not be an exaggeration. Adding to that the clear and vigorous "Midnight Song," ah! Too beautiful. A few lines of Er Liu were also quite proper, but his voice is a bit worse than Yang Baosen, and his face has more acting than Baosen. "Two Generals," I think, is the most powerful show. Li Shaochun comes from a martial arts background. In "The Extraordinary Hero in Red Robe," he was already very famous. So his martial arts skills are really not bad. That leg stood independently for three minutes. Then came three somersaults. He can also sing - in "Two Generals" that I have seen, that General Ma always sings in a "hoarse" voice. Although Zhi Yu tried hard to shout, he couldn't make a sound. - Worthy of being a "civil and military talent." Mao Qinglai really put in hard work. No wonder the Li brothers-in-law both wanted to grab him.

Finally, one should mention Li Baokui's Liu Bei. Don't look down on him for being a secondary role. His singing and acting are much better than the "neither fish nor fowl" leading actor. The expressions of "surprise," "joy," "anxiety," and "resentment" when watching the battle from the city really brought Liu Bei to life at that time. It was really enjoyable to watch!

### A Rehearsal Record of You You Troupe

The You You Troupe rehearsed at the Ningbo Association yesterday. Each of the dramas performed was extremely wonderful, but Mr. Zhou Dongshan's "Teaching his Son, Wang Chune" was even more rare. His opening citation and recitation won thunderous applause. The big paragraph of Er Huang in the machinery room was sung sweetly and clearly, like pearls falling on a jade plate. Old Xue Bao...'s clapper was even more masterful. Other aspects, such as the stage style, the beauty of the makeup, and the generosity of the stage steps, were rare in the amateur world. The entire play was extremely wonderful. The drama was also played by the famous amateur musicians Zhou Dongming and Li Shishan, which added icing to the cake. The flamboyance of the large interlude was no less than that of Lan Yuanshaoqing. Famous amateurs Sun Minhou, Shen Jinling, Miss Zhou Ping and the renowned amateur performer Cheng Junke all praised it.

### Jade Shattered, Pearl Rounded Filming Completed

The filming of the Venus Film Company's "Jade Shattered, Pearl Rounded" was completed yesterday after two months of work. The film was directed by Zheng Xiaoqiu, and the results of the film are better than "Peach Blossom Lake."

Also, following "Jade Shattered, Pearl Rounded," Venus has internally decided on Zhang Shichuan's "Red Tears Shadow," and the complete list of actors is being considered these days.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

Chapter 19: Yellow Turbans and Hu Cavalry Fill the City

Liu Yinyin also wore a white undershirt, revealing two snowy white arms, and reached out to untie the bindings on his legs. He rolled up his trousers, revealing thighs as fair as jade lotus roots. Shi saw that there was a small hole in the wound, not yet healed, with some slight blood flowing out, and some congealed bloodstains nearby. Xu Jing then used cotton to soak in warm water, and gently wiped away the blood stains for Liu Yinyin, dried it, and then went to get the medicinal powder, sprinkled it on the wound, covering the wound completely, took a small piece of oil paper, and put it over the wound, and then stroked it once outside the oil paper, meaning to make the oil paper flatter. Unexpectedly, when his hand touched Liu Yinyin's thigh, Liu Yinyin couldn't help but feel a little itchy, and giggled, shrinking his thigh and saying, "Thank you, I'll tie it up myself." Xu Jing then retracted his hands and stood in front of the bed, watching Liu Yinyin put down his trousers and slowly tie them up. As soon as he had tied them, but because Liu Yinyin's upper body was leaning forward too much, the corner of the cotton quilt covering his body suddenly slipped down. Liu Yinyin didn't realize it at first, but later he raised his head and saw Xu Jing's eyes staring at him without letting go, and then he realized that a button on his small shirt was not buttoned up, and was loose, revealing his snowy white neck and a corner of his chest. His face turned red, and he quickly pulled up the cotton quilt, covered his body, and lay down. When Xu Jing saw his appearance, a cloud of suspicion arose. He thought to himself that Liu Yinyin's skin was so white and smooth, like ice and jade, and resembled that of a girl. Seeing me, he is always shy and hesitant, isn't it ridiculous? If he is not a girl, why would he be like this? (234)
