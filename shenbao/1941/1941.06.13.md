### Breakdown of Negotiations Between Japan and the Dutch East Indies; Arita to Return to Japan Soon; Cabinet Holds Secret Meeting to Decide Final Stance; Instructions to Delegation to Be Published Within Days

Tokyo - Chief Japanese negotiator Arita, in the Japanese-Dutch negotiations, recently told the Yomiuri Shimbun via radiophone that due to the Dutch East Indies' strong stance, a compromise is impossible. Therefore, he may leave the Dutch East Indies without consulting with Dutch officials. The newspaper also quoted Arita as saying that unless Foreign Minister Matsuoka issues instructions, he personally sees no need to negotiate with the Dutch side before leaving. He reiterated that the Dutch East Indies' firm stance leaves no room for compromise. The paper also stated that Arita had revealed that public opinion in the Dutch East Indies is extremely strong. Various newspapers also supported the position of the Dutch economic representatives. Arita is expected to depart for Japan on June 29. This afternoon, the Japanese Foreign Ministry telegraphed Arita with instructions to return to Japan, specifying that Japan's policy regarding the Dutch East Indies' response to Japan's final proposals, the instructions for the Japanese-Dutch negotiations, and Japan's statement of its stance will be announced here tomorrow.

Tokyo - With Japan abandoning economic negotiations in Batavia, government authorities held a secret cabinet meeting yesterday to resolve Japan's future policy. It was subsequently declared that if the Dutch East Indies' "rigid attitude" requires military action to subdue it, "now is the time." Government sources stated that Japan can no longer tolerate the Dutch East Indies' "belligerence." It is widely believed that the Dutch representatives' refusal to negotiate and sell the goods Japan requested is a blatant defiance of the Axis powers by the Dutch East Indies government and an obstacle to ending the China Incident. It is reported that the chief Japanese representative, Arita, may be ordered to return to Japan. Japanese officials insist that Japan is determined to satisfy its interests in the near future. They believe that since the opening of the Burma Road and the U.S. pledge to lend money to Chongqing, this failed negotiation is Japan's first setback. Japanese officials assert that because Japan and the Soviet Union have signed a treaty of friendship, the Soviet border no longer poses a threat to Japan. The British navy is "overwhelmed," and the United States is preoccupied with concerns in the Atlantic and unable to assist the British navy in Asia. Therefore, Japan does not need to be cautious in dealing with the Dutch East Indies. (International News Service, 12th)

Tokyo - Domei News Agency announced today that the Foreign Ministry has issued government instructions to Arita, chief representative for the Japanese-Dutch negotiations. It is understood that this directive will be publicly announced tomorrow. Domei also stated that the Foreign Ministry will simultaneously release a statement clarifying the Japanese government's views on the Japanese-Dutch negotiations and the Dutch East Indies' response to Japan's proposals. This morning, Foreign Minister Matsuoka reported to the Emperor on the Japanese-Dutch negotiations and other diplomatic issues, which lasted ninety-five minutes. (United Press, 12th) Tokyo - Official sources here declared last night that the Japanese cabinet met yesterday for four hours and has now decided on Japan's final stance toward Batavia and new instructions for the Japanese delegation to the Dutch East Indies. The content of the resolutions will be published within a reasonable period. Well-informed sources here believe that the Japanese delegation will be recalled from the Dutch East Indies. It is believed that the cabinet has also considered the consequences of this action. (Haitong Telegram, 12th)

### Washington Has Not Yet Expressed an Attitude on the Matter

Washington - News that Tokyo has instructed its representatives in Batavia to terminate negotiations with the Dutch East Indies has attracted considerable attention here. However, Under Secretary of State Welles, while hosting reporters on behalf of Hull this morning, declined to comment on the news before receiving official information. When asked whether the U.S. would have access to raw materials such as elephant hide if the Dutch East Indies acceded to Japanese demands, Welles replied that he did not know what Japan was demanding or what the Dutch East Indies was refusing, so he could not comment at this time. Japanese sources claim that Japan's negotiations with the Dutch East Indies are purely economic in nature, but meetings among those in the Tokyo power structure regarding the Dutch East Indies negotiations seem to clearly indicate that the negotiations are of a political, even military, nature. Although there are reports from Tokyo that Japan cannot accept the Dutch East Indies' response, Washington officials still do not believe that Japan will launch an aggressive act to seize what it wants from the Dutch East Indies for itself and its Axis allies. Washington is closely monitoring the situation. It is widely expected that the Dutch East Indies will not change its firm stance. Whether Japan is merely bluffing or intends to advance southward while still mired in China will soon be seen. According to recent news from here, those in Tokyo who advocate moderation are gaining influence. There is no immediate concern of major changes occurring in the East. (Reuters, 12th)

### Japanese Newspapers Unanimously Express the Need to Enforce Demands

Tokyo - The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated in today's editorial that the withdrawal of the Japanese economic delegation from Batavia will strengthen Japan's determination to make the entire Dutch East Indies an "important member" of Japan's "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The nationalist Hochi Shimbun demanded the immediate withdrawal of the delegation, arguing that delaying the withdrawal would damage Japan's prestige, and urged the government to take "the most effective measures" to cope with the situation. The newspaper stated that the resources of the Dutch East Indies should not be monopolized by the Netherlands, Britain, or the United States. The Dutch East Indies should remember that Japan will not hesitate to make any sacrifices to achieve "co-prosperity," regardless of the attitude of the Dutch East Indies and third countries. (United Press, 12th)

### Japanese Residents in the Dutch East Indies Prepare to Evacuate

Tokyo - The Asahi Shimbun's report from Batavia today states that a large number of Japanese residents are evacuating from the Dutch East Indies due to fears about the future relationship between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. The report states that the mass evacuation of Japanese residents, including those from Borneo and Sumatra, is under consideration due to the tense relationship caused by the breakdown of trade negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. Forty-two Japanese women are scheduled to leave Batavia today. The newspaper said that space on three ships departing from Batavia has also been reserved. (United Press, 12th)

### Germany Speaks for Japan, Warns the Dutch East Indies

Berlin - A German government spokesman stated yesterday that if Japanese Prime Minister Konoe takes decisive action on the Dutch East Indies issue, the German government will support Japan's policy and recognize Tokyo's legitimate desire to seek "living space" in the Dutch East Indies and establish a new order. The spokesman criticized the Dutch East Indies for not exporting raw materials to Germany, and a German official stated that the Dutch East Indies "in reality is an ally of the enemy." Observers believe that the spokesman's statement is a warning to Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies, and that Berlin has given Tokyo a blank check, meaning that now that the economic conference in Batavia has ended, Japan can act freely as it sees fit. (Central News Agency, 12th)

### Philippine Independence Act to be Amended Again

Washington - The Philippines is considering a second amendment to its Independence Act of 1934. This amendment is intended to suspend export taxes in order to adjust the country's economy as it moves toward independence. Philippine Resident Commissioner Elizalde, after consulting with U.S. congressional and executive leaders for several weeks, stated that his proposal does not change the independence process in 1946, but only recognizes the economic pressure the Philippines is under due to the war. Elizalde emphasized that the suspension of export taxes is limited to one year, after which the tax will be reimposed. (United Press, 12th)

### Luce Believes Japanese Invasion of China Will Make Little Progress; Chinese Army Has Increased to Four Million; Any Policy Japan Adopts Will Inevitably Lead to a Miserable Defeat

New York - Henry Luce, an American author born in China and editor-in-chief of Time and Life magazines, stated on American radio last night that the Chinese army has increased to four million men and that the Japanese invasion is making no progress. Luce, a director of the United China Relief, recently returned from a general inspection of Free China. Luce and his wife, the famous playwright Clare Boothe Luce, personally visited the front lines in China for twenty days. He stated that the current positions of the Chinese army are along a 2,000-mile front. If Japan wants to succeed, it must make a maximum effort to break through the salient points of the Chinese military line. If the Chinese army remains in place, any policy Japan adopts will inevitably lead to a miserable defeat. Many educated Chinese people do not understand why the United States is still supplying military supplies to Japan. Japanese planes are currently using American gasoline and bombs made from American metals to bomb Chongqing. However, China's ability to mount a "great resistance" is largely due to the Chinese people knowing that the United States is friendly to China and to the expressions of support from the United China Relief. (United Press, 12th)

### U.S. Builds Two-Ocean Navy; Additional Large Sums Allocated

Washington - Government sources said today that the executive branch plans to submit a new naval budget to Congress to accelerate the building of a huge two-ocean navy.

### U.S. Aircraft Factory Strike Completely Resolved

Inglewood - Lieutenant Colonel Brandt, the military officer in charge of the North American Aviation factory, stated that the strike has completely ended, and production has resumed at 100% efficiency. Seven people have been fired, and another person will be removed if they dare to return to the factory. These people have all taken actions that harm the public interest of the American people, so they cannot be allowed to do so. (Central News Agency, 12th)

Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox declared yesterday at a meeting of the aviation industry that communist saboteurs are now using labor union activities to undermine American freedom, and that such people will henceforth be treated as enemies of the state. The government's handling of the Los Angeles strike does not challenge collective bargaining or labor union activities, but it does challenge those who use labor union activities to attack American freedom.

Editorial

### Stalled Negotiations with the Dutch East Indies

After the Dutch East Indies authorities rejected Japan's "final proposal" of May 7, negotiations between the two sides have effectively stalled. Over the past few days, the Japanese government has held repeated meetings and decided yesterday to order Arita and his delegation to withdraw from the negotiations in Batavia, indicating that it cannot accept the Dutch East Indies' response. At the same time, Japanese residents in the Dutch East Indies are also withdrawing en masse, presenting a very tense situation on the surface. For nearly a year, the Dutch East Indies issue has been an important link in the Far East and even for the entire world. The stalling of these negotiations is bound to have serious consequences and even affect the global situation, making it an issue worthy of the utmost attention.

To this day, the outside world knows nothing about the content of Japan's demands on the Dutch East Indies or the major points of contention between the two sides. At most, it only knows from the Dutch representative's two-point statement on May 7 that the Dutch side's most important opinions are: first, not to recognize the "East Asia New Order" and its leadership; and second, to oppose the direct or indirect use of Dutch East Indies resources to aid the enemy (referring to Germany). These two points are naturally points of disagreement between the two sides, but beyond this, even if the Japanese side were willing to guarantee that raw materials would not flow into Axis countries and sought to obtain all or most of the Dutch East Indies' exports, it is likely that the Dutch side would not accept it. This shows that there are many difficulties involved, not only in the political realm but also within the purely economic sphere, which is why negotiations have failed to achieve a compromise despite repeated changes in the Japanese representative over the years.

Since the Japanese side's attention shifted from the Asian mainland southward, the Dutch East Indies' resources have been treated as a lifeline. After Arita's two statements regarding the Dutch East Indies, commercial negotiations were launched. Although the two sides reached a compromise on items such as oil exports to Japan, it was still far from meeting Japan's demands. The Dutch East Indies authorities' unexpectedly strong attitude has made Japan's diplomacy, which had previously accommodated Britain, appeased the Soviet Union, and forced Vichy to yield, unable to make progress even after Arita's "final proposal" was presented to the Dutch East Indies, whose homeland had already fallen. On May 30, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka issued a statement declaring that Japan was absolutely loyal to the Tripartite Pact, while hinting that if the development of the international situation made Japan's peaceful policy toward the South Seas impossible, it would reconsider that policy depending on the circumstances. Although the wording was still euphemistic, it was, in effect, putting pressure on Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies in order to break the deadlock in negotiations. The Japanese newspapers and public opinion have recently been clamoring in response to Matsuoka's statements on the Dutch East Indies issue. Now that the Japanese side has withdrawn its representatives, it is still seriously considering further countermeasures, while a German government spokesman has engaged in incitement, urging the Japanese side to deal with the situation harshly. It is evident that the Axis countries, which are eager to contain Britain and the United States in the Far East, would be pleased if this spark were to start a prairie fire.

However, although Japan is a member of the alliance and has a strong desire for expansion, its actions are actually determined by its own interests and are not entirely controllable by its allies. For example, in a recent article in the Hochi Shimbun, Japanese scholar Teiichi Muto argued that Japan's affiliation with the Allied powers in the previous World War was a mistake and insisted that it should not repeat that error. He also deeply regretted the Japanese army's reckless capture of Qingdao at that time. However, the current situation surrounding the Dutch East Indies is by no means comparable to Qingdao. If Japan takes reckless action, it may lead to an even more difficult outcome. First, the current Dutch East Indies is no longer as exposed and weak as it was a year ago. The Japanese side has missed the opportunity to use blitzkrieg tactics when the Western front of Britain and France collapsed. Leaving aside the land defense forces there, in terms of naval strength alone, its light fleet, including a number of destroyers and submarines, is said to be quite capable of dealing with an overseas expeditionary fleet. What is more, there is a considerable air force to coordinate with it. Second, in terms of the strategic situation in the South China Sea, any Japanese naval base is more than a thousand nautical miles from any island in the Dutch East Indies, exceeding the maximum distance for overseas operations. Japanese ships, which lack sufficient endurance, would face great difficulties in terms of combat technology. Moreover, it is not easy to penetrate the waters controlled by Singapore to seize Java and Sumatra. Third, and more importantly, military cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies in the Far East has already taken shape. Singapore, Surabaya, Manila, and Darwin in northern Australia are mutually reinforcing, and their combined military strength, in a situation of waiting for the enemy, is sufficient to cope with the Japanese offensive. According to Japanese scholar Masanori Ito, an attack on the Dutch East Indies by Japan will inevitably lead to a war between the United States and Japan. Given the U.S.'s consistent concern for the Dutch East Indies and the recent frequent visits by Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens between Batavia and Washington, this statement is likely to be close to the truth. Therefore, before taking decisive action against the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese side must have the resolve to fight the United States. Although strong rhetoric toward the U.S. has been heard from time to time, knowledgeable Japanese have gradually realized the danger of blindly acting rashly. The Japanese government has been quite cautious in its attitude toward the Dutch East Indies issue, and even now that negotiations have stalled, it has still not taken immediate action. This is naturally due to the various difficulties it sees ahead and a reflection of various cautious views.

Therefore, even though the Japanese side has decided to recall its representatives in the Dutch East Indies, it still hopes that the situation can be resolved through concessions from the Dutch East Indies. At present, the situation no longer depends on the Japanese-Dutch negotiations themselves, but on the overall international situation and the course of the war.

### Chinese Army in Suiyuan Moves East in Three Routes to Launch New Offensive Against Japan; Cutting off Communications on the Eastern Railway of Baotou; Advancing from Wuyuan to Anbei

Chongqing - This afternoon, a Chinese military spokesman told reporters that the Chinese army in Suiyuan is currently moving east in three routes, crossing the Mongolian desert, and encircling Baotou, an important stronghold and trade center of the Japanese army. Before the Chinese army launched its offensive, it cut off the railway east of Baotou to block communications and delay Japanese reinforcements and supplies. A strong Chinese army is advancing east from Wuyuan to Anbei to eliminate the Japanese army operating north of the Wula Mountains. Another Chinese army is attacking Anbei City, while a third Chinese army is attacking the highway between Anbei and Baotou. A Chinese army has crossed Anbei and is attacking various points to the north and northeast. Two other Chinese armies have crossed the Yellow River and are attacking various points northwest of Baotou. (Reuters, 12th)

### Fierce Fighting Occurs East of Qingyang

Tunxi - The Japanese army in southern Anhui took advantage of the heavy wind and rain on the night of the 10th to move surreptitiously. The Japanese troops stationed east of Tongling, including Lianyushan and Wuyutang north of Qingyang, launched attacks on the Chinese side. Fierce fighting has broken out in the mountainous areas east of Qingyang, including Muzhen and south of Suyushan. On the 11th, Japanese aircraft also came to assist in the battle. The Chinese army occupied favorable terrain and intercepted the attacking Japanese army. Fighting is currently underway. (11th dispatch)

Gutian - The Chinese army achieved significant results in the battle to recapture Dahu, a key point northwest of Fuzhou, at the end of last month.

Unfortunately, he was shot in the left flank, but he continued to fight bravely. When Guo fell, the soldiers immediately seized the Japanese machine gun that had shot him and captured all six gunners. Guo's coffin was transported to a certain place yesterday, where it was greeted by local organizations offering flowers. At the same time as Guo's death, Feng Yusheng, a platoon leader of a certain Chinese unit, entered the Japanese position alone after the Japanese soldiers occupied a certain high ground. Feng was stabbed by two Japanese soldiers. Knowing that he had no hope of survival, Feng detonated a grenade, killing himself and the two Japanese soldiers. In addition, a certain soldier, after suffering three serious injuries, still carried a heavy machine gun and a rifle back to the original position. What is commendable is that the wounded officers and soldiers of the Chinese army in this battle all brought back some of their weapons and captured valuable spoils of war, demonstrating the high morale and courage of the Chinese soldiers.

### America Aids Democratic Nations with Large Quantities of Military Equipment—Roosevelt Submits a Report to Congress on the Implementation of the Lend-Lease Act

Washington President Roosevelt submitted to Congress the first report describing the situation in which the United States provided supplies to Britain, China, and other democratic nations under the Lend-Lease Act. It stated that in the first five months of this year, the number of aircraft shipped to Britain increased twelvefold compared to the same period last year, and aircraft engines increased tenfold. Currently, more heavy bombers and medium bombers are being shipped. In terms of value, explosives increased seventeenfold and arms and ammunition increased ninetyfold in the first quarter of this year. As of the end of May, the main allocations under the Lend-Lease Act included 88,000,000 yuan for the purchase of arms and other items, 318,000,000 yuan for tanks and other vehicles, and 551,000,000 yuan for ships. Long-range bombers, ships, tanks, and other war equipment needed for the defense of democratic nations have been ordered separately. The remaining funds are insufficient by 2,750,000,000 yuan and will be allocated as soon as possible. Britain has already received surplus American rifles, machine guns, field guns, aircraft, and ammunition, worth over 43,000,000 yuan. This equipment arrived in Britain after the Dunkirk evacuation. The effect of the arrival of these supplies on Britain's summer resistance cannot be estimated. In this report, the President stated, "American aid can enable Britain to surpass the Axis powers in terms of armaments. We must ensure that these armaments can be safely used to defeat the aggressors. From March 11 to May 21, the output of tools was [zero] yuan. Although this number is small, the export of war equipment to Britain has gradually increased since September 1939. In the future, we will supply more aircraft, artillery, ammunition, and other war equipment to Britain, China, and other democratic nations resisting aggression. Facts and numbers will only be disclosed to the extent that they are available, without revealing military secrets that would benefit the Axis powers. These facts only indicate the past and present state of American aid to democratic nations, but do not represent the most important fact. But the most important fact is the American people's strong determination to prevent aggressive violence from dominating the world. Our current goal is not only for our current security, but also for our future survival. We have begun the large-scale supply program necessary to defeat the Axis powers. To make it effective, all the aid we give must be multifaceted. Ships are necessary to carry war equipment and food. We are now enabling Britain to obtain ships—oil tankers with a gross tonnage of 2 million tons—but this number is still insufficient. We must maintain full shipping capacity every day from now on. Since the appropriations bill was passed, 550,000,000 yuan has been allocated for the construction of new ships, and the new methods needed to build these new ships are also being completed. Allied ships are now being repaired by us, equipped by us to protect against naval mines, and armed by us to defend against piracy. British warships are also being repaired by us so that they can quickly resume their maritime duties," he said. (12th Reuters dispatch)

Strengthening Defenses to Cope with Air Raids

London Lord Beaverbrook, former Minister of Aircraft Production, stated in the House of Lords yesterday for the first time in his capacity as Minister of State, "There are various reasons to expect that enemy bomber attacks will become more frequent, but we have strengthened and improved our defenses to prepare for them." He also congratulated his successor on the record-breaking high production of aircraft and engines in May. During the debate on civil defense, Lord Strabolgi advocated unifying the various defense agencies under the sole jurisdiction of one minister. Beaverbrook did not agree with this view, saying that the duties handled by the ministers of various departments are extremely heavy and complex, and it is not advisable to merge them for the sake of national interest. Lord Astor suggested subsidizing civilians after air raids. He replied that production is far more important than the impact of air raids on civilians. In any situation, production must continue as much as possible. The army defends the country to resist imminent aggression, so priority should be given to the army's accommodation, and then consider the civilians' housing. (12th Reuters dispatch)

### Allied Forces in Syria Make Progress—A घेराव Position Has Been Formed—The Northeast Roads Will Converge in Aleppo—British Troops Advance Along the Coast Beyond the Litani River

London The British and Free French forces, advancing in five routes, have again made great strides and are forming a घेराव position in Syria. The capture of Beirut and Damascus is generally expected to be completed in the previous two days, but it has been delayed due to unexpectedly fierce French resistance. However, this morning, this resistance, except for those surrounding Damascus, seems to have been largely overcome. One team advancing along the coast, after fierce fighting north of the Litani River, is reportedly a few miles outside Sidon, about twenty miles from Beirut. The third team is either on the outskirts of Damascus or has advanced to a location closer to Kisweh, about ten miles from Damascus. The fourth team, starting from the Iraqi border city of Abu Kamal, has reportedly advanced eighty miles. The fifth team is advancing along a road parallel to the Syrian border. The fiercest fighting is likely in the Kisweh area. (12th United Press dispatch)

London According to the latest war report from Syria, the Imperial military divisions attacking Syria from Palestine continue to make satisfactory progress. Two columns of British troops advancing from Iraq have penetrated deep into Syria. According to Ankara radio, a brigade of British mechanized troops advancing along the south bank of the Euphrates River occupied Deir ez-Zor, seventy miles from the Iraqi border, yesterday. Ankara military commentators said that the location is a military key point, from which one can reach Aleppo to the north and Palmyra and Damascus to the southwest, but this news and the news that the second British column from Iraq has penetrated one hundred miles into Syria, as reported by Ankara, have not yet been verified by London. The Vichy forces seem to be putting up a major resistance on the coastal road to Beirut and in front of Damascus. It is reported that fighting in the coastal area is still taking place north of the Litani River. Vichy troops have dug trenches in predetermined positions to hold the area. According to a Middle East British radio broadcaster, various Australian armored vehicles occupied Tyre and crossed the Litani River and are now advancing north, encountering French armored troops. In the first engagement, Australian troops destroyed two enemy tanks. It is reported that the Australian troops in the area had just arrived in the Middle East a short time ago. These people are well trained and equipped, but most have never seen battle. (12th Reuters dispatch)

London According to reports from London today, British troops advancing along the coastal road in Syria have reached a location less than six miles from Sidon.

(12th Reuters dispatch)

The two roads of British troops may converge and continue to advance towards Aleppo. (12th Reuters dispatch)

Vichy Front-line news, British troops advanced along the Lebanese coast yesterday and reached within artillery range of the port of Beirut. British troops crossed the Litani River and opened a blood road. An army regiment endured great sacrifices and resisted in bloody battles, resisting the British mechanical army, and finally collapsed due to the British warships opening fire and bombarding fiercely. The three cutting edges of the British attack in the south have greatly increased their reinforcements. Since dawn, a strong tank team has crossed the Litani River and pushed northward to Seseda under the cover of naval artillery. Last night, it was not far from its destination, Beirut (this important naval port). The British army in the central south, after receiving reinforcements, advanced along the Jordan River. The French defense line defending the British invasion in the Hasbaya Valley was broken through. Another team of British troops on the east bank of the Jordan River attacking Damascus made no progress, because the French army counterattacked frequently. Further east, Free French troops advanced along the highway from Amman to Damascus, and also received reinforcements, with British tanks and artillery, but were repelled by the French army in the Kissweh area at noon.

(2) In southern Lebanon, the Australian Federal Army, under the cover of British warship artillery fire, continuously attacked the main stronghold of our army, and made some progress north of the Litani River. (3) Although our army suffered great losses, it still vowed to resist. This spirit of sacrifice is commendable. (4) On the western slope of Mount Hermon, our army defending the city of Metek has been forced to retreat to the north of Mount Asbaya. (5) Our army in Mount Hermon and the city of Terruz yesterday afternoon launched successive large-scale counterattacks under the cover of the Air Force, which were very successful, preventing the British army south of Kisweh from succeeding in directly approaching the city of Damascus. Fierce fighting is still underway. British troops attacked our position under the cover of tanks, which was very fierce, but our army still resolutely resisted. (6) A mechanized British force invading Syria from Iraq has engaged in a battle with our army in the Syrian border area of ​​Khemerville. (7) Our Air Force cooperated with the Army in combat in various places on the front line, which was very successful. It flew to various places to bomb the British Army and fleet. On the night of the 8th, it shot down nine British aircraft, and shot down more enemy aircraft yesterday and today. (11th Havas dispatch)

Vichy Military observers here say that after the army north of the Litani River in Lebanon was forced to move north to protect the city of Sidon, only one battalion of French troops was left to cover the retreat of the main force, in order to prevent the enemy from taking advantage of the victory and advancing north. The lone army fought hard for two days, which can be called tragic. (11th Havas dispatch)

New York American newspapers approve of British action in Syria. The New York Sun said that the protests issued by Vichy are not being paid much attention to. General Petain's statement that Vichy refused the invasion of Syria for the sake of protecting French territory is only a joke.

The French now still know who is fighting for their ultimate prosperity, freedom, and glory. (12th Reuters dispatch)

### Franco-German Relations Are Now Strained

Madrid According to news received here, the French in Syria are clearly unwilling to comply with Vichy's promises to Hitler, so Franco-German relations are now quite "strained." A newspaper's diplomatic editor wrote that although Berlin says that the Syrian dispute is an event between France and England, if Syria is unable to resist, or if British and Tergo propaganda is effective, and it does not resist, then Germany cannot remain indifferent. The advance of British and French soldiers led by Generals Wilson and Catroux will have repercussions affecting relations between Berlin and Vichy, which is not impossible. (12th Reuters dispatch)

### Hawaii Still Needs Greater Air Defense, More American Flying Fortresses Arrive, Large Food Warehouses Under Construction

Honolulu – Lieutenant General Short, commander of the U.S. Army in Hawaii, told the Associated Press yesterday that modern tactics are constantly changing, making it necessary to further strengthen the air defense and anti-aircraft artillery of Hawaii, which has become one of the most heavily fortified areas in the world. Short said that in the past 20 years, the War Department has allocated more funds for the defense of Hawaii than for any other defense area. As a result, Hawaii's defense engineering has made it one of the most heavily fortified areas in the world. However, the constant emergence of modern tactics has shown that Hawaii needs to further increase its air defense. The War Department's announcement that it will transfer 21 "Flying Fortress" bombers to Hawaii has indicated the department's intention to strengthen air defenses there. We recall that when the Flying Fortresses arrived in Hawaii, the War Department also revealed that more Flying Fortresses would be shipped later, and that the U.S. forces stationed in Hawaii have also been substantially strengthened due to the addition of modern-style destroyers and light bombers. Short also said, however, that until we know what form the world situation will take, we cannot say that Hawaii is fully equipped to cope with any situation. Short also said that although 36 percent of Hawaii's residents are Japanese or Americans of Japanese ancestry, there is no racial discrimination between army personnel and the mixed Hawaiian residents, and there are no factors that could lead to racial conflict. He also said that although many of the soldiers drafted in Hawaii are Americans of Japanese ancestry, there are no racial opinions among the enlistees in the Hawaiian military. The actions of soldiers of Japanese ancestry and their enthusiasm in their work are sufficient to prove that they are all loyal. The descendants of Japanese in Hawaii not only do not oppose the U.S. drafting their children into the military, but also regard the fact that their children are engaged in defense training as an honor. Regarding the defense cooperation between the public and the military, Short repeatedly stated the four main facts of public preparation that he had previously mentioned, namely: (1) producing and storing food; (2) organizing medical and nursing teams to treat and care for wounded soldiers; (3) organizing auxiliary police to protect public utilities and prevent sabotage; and (4) preparing plans for evacuating women and children and establishing air-raid shelters for workers near major industrial areas. Short also revealed that the local army is taking steps to deal with the food shortage problem, stating that the army has been authorized by the higher authorities to build a huge underground warehouse capable of holding 2 million pounds of grain, and that the plan for refrigeration engineers to build a 175,000-cubic-foot warehouse has been underway for several months. Two million pounds of grain may be enough to supply the residents of Oahu Island for eight days in normal times, and may last several more days in the event of famine. Short also said that various news reports have indicated that residents in various areas are experiencing a severe shortage of food. In addition, news from Washington indicates that the federal government is likely to provide substantial assistance in the near future. (Associated Press, 12th)

### Cripps Returns to London, Britain to Decide on Relations with Soviet Union, Rumors of German Troops Concentrated on the Baltic and Black Sea Borders, Aimed at Coercing the Soviet Union to Make Economic Concessions

London – London officially announced last night that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Cripps, who recently left Moscow and flew to Britain via Sweden, has arrived in the UK. The British Foreign Office released the following statement: "British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps, who has returned home for consultations, has arrived in the UK. Undersecretary of State Butler and Foreign Secretary's representative Mallet were at the airport to welcome him." The British ambassador is here at Eden's request and will return to his post after a few days. (Reuters, 12th)

London – After British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps arrived in London yesterday, diplomatic activities in various European capitals have intensified.

Meanwhile, according to news from Ankara, the Soviet Ambassador to Turkey is now on his way home.

(Reuters, 12th)

London – Diplomatic correspondents for London's morning newspapers discuss possible developments on the German-Soviet border. The Times states that on the surface, everything seems quiet between Germany and the Soviet Union. Hitler and Stalin may have different dreams, but because there is a friendly alliance, both sides speak of faithfully adhering to this alliance when they mention it. However, this is the surface appearance of the official arena and cannot hide the truth. According to news from various parts of Europe, Hitler is now deliberately pushing relations with the Soviet Union to a serious point. In recent weeks, he has mobilized large numbers of troops and deployed them on the Soviet border from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. This plan is by no means secret, and Hitler has even indicated to guests that the German side is confident of success. We think it is just a scare tactic. The News Chronicle said that if the news coming from European capitals under German control is reliable, then there will be significant changes in Soviet-German relations within a week or a few weeks. The intention of Germany to invade the Soviet Union should be kept secret, but the German side is openly talking about it. Why is that? Many diplomatic observers find it puzzling. As for the gathering of troops on the border, no matter what the purpose, there is no doubt that Germany is determined to coerce the Soviet Union to supply Germany with large quantities of oil and grain, regardless of the needs of its own people and economy. (Reuters, 12th)

Prior to the Soviet Ambassador giving this assurance, there had been widespread rumors in diplomatic circles that the Soviet Union had negotiated with Germany, and some had even said that it had concluded an agreement with Germany, making huge economic concessions to Germany, and even dividing Iraq, Iran, and the rest of the Near East into Soviet and German spheres of influence.

### Public Sale of Rice, Including the Ka Min Tang Rice

Yesterday's market for foreign rice initially fell and then stabilized, with the situation still not breaking free from the oscillating pattern. Prices initially fell by two or three yuan, then rebounded by one or two yuan, but ultimately closed slightly lower by one or two yuan. Repurchased goods of Inghua Co.'s original-packaged rice were being hoarded and released by customers, further weakening the market. This was because the market opened weak after several days of fatigue, and people were very apprehensive due to the large amount of existing stock and the huge quantity of new orders. In addition to the originally designated small polished rice, the Shanghai Municipal Council's public sale of rice has now expanded to include Ka Min Tang rice as a public sale at a flat price. About 500 tons, or about 5,000 bags, have already been approved for sale, with merchants purchasing them at a price of 127 yuan and 25 cents, plus a profit and expenses of 9 yuan and 5 cents, totaling 136 yuan and 30 cents. The retail price is usually 2 yuan higher than the small polished rice, at 112 yuan. The public sale will commence as soon as the rice arrives, further unsettling people and causing the market price to fall by two or three yuan. Subsequently, merchants and inland buyers helped with flat-price purchases, and their appetite was strong, and the market immediately turned from fatigue to stabilizing, so the result was only a slight drop of one or two yuan. Inghua Co.'s broken rice opened at 105 yuan and 50 cents and 105 yuan, small polished rice ranged from 136 to 37 yuan to 135 yuan and 50 cents, and No. 1 Saigon rice was at 136 to 37 yuan, with a turnover of 700 to 800 tons. The current rice offerings were between 13,000 and 14,000 bags.

Thick japonica domestic rice, which had been barely maintaining a stable price for the past two days, finally succumbed to the lack of sales in the local market and softened, opening at 134 to 35 yuan for fresh early and late rice from Nanhui, 132 yuan for ordinary rice, 130 yuan for old rice, and 129 yuan, 112 yuan for old original-packaged rice, and 121 to 119 yuan for original-packaged old japonica rice from Wuxi, a drop of about 2 yuan.

After rising continuously for days, the market for foreign glutinous rice seemed to have satisfied its demand, and those holding goods gradually released them, so the market supply slightly increased. But things are valued when they are scarce, and now that the market has suddenly turned strong, people have become slack, and the sales channels for rice meals and cake shops have immediately weakened, creating a situation of oversupply, and the market has turned soft, with all prices falling by one or two yuan. Hong Kong special round-grain rice was selling for 114 to 15 yuan, long-grain rice for 113 yuan, then down to 111 yuan and 50 cents, rice for 102 to 3 yuan, domestic glutinous rice for 110 yuan, then down to 116 to 17 yuan.

The flour market was initially fatigued and then tightened. When the market opened in the morning, it was depressed due to the tepid appetite in the local market. Jindong flour from the Pudong warehouse only opened at 28 yuan and 50 cents. Around noon, a local merchant bought 500 bags of Jindong flour from the Puxi warehouse for 28 yuan and 50 cents. The situation suddenly tightened in the afternoon, as news of the tense situation in the Dutch East Indies made the foreign flour price unsustainable, and rumors spread that the news of new wheat arriving in Shanghai was false, which prompted speculators to actively hoard purchases. The price of Jindong flour suddenly rose to 29 yuan and 20 cents, then 30 cents and 40 cents, up to 50 cents, with nearly 10,000 bags traded. The price of Clock Tower brand Australian flour, which was also scarce, also opened at 31 yuan, reportedly from a dealer distributing a certain quantity. It was said that all of it was sold locally, and that no more flour was available for sale at 31 yuan.

Trading in wheat was still sluggish, and industry operators confirmed that rumors were inaccurate. According to discussions within the industry, there were concerns about the impact of propaganda, and the market had indeed been significantly affected. The problem of new wheat arriving in Shanghai is now under control, and hopes have been dashed for the time being. Efforts are currently being made to find a solution.

### Miscellaneous Grains and Bean Cakes Plunge

Yesterday, the price of corn continued to plunge by 1 yuan and 70 to 80 cents.

### Finance: Tensions Re-escalate in Dutch East Indies, US Exchange Rate Returns to Level, Sterling Still Slightly Declining

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the exchange rates of the various currencies listed by HSBC remain level. The black market for the Sterling-US dollar exchange rate saw little change, with only the current month's US exchange rate softening briefly due to speculators covering short positions, closing at 5.34375 yuan.

The silver balancing tax continued to be levied at 25.75 percent, trending towards stagnation.

### Gold Market Listless Before Exchange; Settled Price Only Made Ten Yuan, Longs in Current Session Have Difficulty Employing Usual Tactics

Yesterday, the gold market saw a dark market with fluctuating prices, rising first and then falling. Although the exchange for the current session will be held at 8:00 AM tomorrow, the listed prices of HSBC Small and Standard Chartered Bank were the same as the black market, both settling at 5.375, which is 6,479 yuan. If it still stands at the original price today, it will only decrease by ten yuan. The premium offered to buyers was also only ten yuan or so. The longs had difficulty employing their usual tactics. Moreover, with negative news in both the forward and spot markets, the Dutch East Indies situation was tense again, and the Japanese representative declared that the Tripartite Pact would be implemented, along with rumors of the withdrawal of Japanese bridges. Therefore, the securities firm Defu and the silver firm Heng Kee Jin raised the price to 6,489 yuan, and the settled price was also raised. Soon after, remittance merchants engaged in large-scale arbitrage selling. Under the influence of negative news, the price gradually fell. In the afternoon, at the current rate, Shi He even sold more than a thousand taels, dropping to 6,461 yuan, and finally only hedged a slight three yuan.

### Public Bonds and Hot Money Already Responding

The dark market for public bonds continued to rise. Category C bonds had broken through the 70 yuan mark, and other types had also surged by one level. The financial community's appetite was even stronger. Banks such as Guohua and Women's Bank, following Jin Cheng, absorbed funds on a large scale. The abundant liquidity further proved that this was the only outlet for hot money. As the half-year interest period was approaching, current purchases already included four and a half months of interest. Yesterday, Da Zhong, on behalf of a certain bank, bought in enthusiastically. Xie Da, Lian Yi, Heng Kang, Fu Xing, Xin Chang, Yi Chang, and Lian He all bought in successively. Xie Da sold Category E bonds, and the rest was supplied by scattered retail investors. Market prices gradually rose, with Category C bonds breaking through the 70 yuan mark. Xie Da continued to buy. Run De, Yi Chang, Tong Shun, Qian Yi, Li Feng, Yi Zhong, and Le Mao were all buyers. Transactions expanded further. On the selling side, Xin Chang, Hu He Ji, and Yong Kang were more active. Lian He and Ren Feng sold first and then bought back. The rest was supplied by general retail investors short selling. As a result, prices rose again by three to nine cents, and the total transaction volume was approximately 3.5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

### Yarn and Cotton; Shorts Struggling But Still Forceful; Yarn Market Lingering

The yarn market continued to rise, and the trend remained firm. At the same time, Hong Kong merchants continued to relentlessly demand Shuang Ma yarn, so sentiment was good, and there was a sense of lack of chips on the market. The short exchange rate was still quoted at half a cent, and the longs did not pay the interest rate, but had income and profits, so they had a stronger desire to go long. However, some argued that there were many buyers and they were deeply afraid of not being able to benefit from the longs, so small companies were still struggling on the short side. After the market price rose, it fell back down. Generally speaking, the market may still have the possibility of seeing 1,450 yuan. Today's trend has shown obvious signs of lingering. In short, the fundamental problem must rely on actual sales as the first priority. The high price for 20-count Shuang Ma was 1,475 yuan, and the low price was 1,458 yuan. The initial momentum in the afternoon was very high, at 1,471 yuan, rising to 74 yuan. After that, the securities firms came out and gradually fell to 1,460 yuan. The final price was 1,465 yuan. Today, 635 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Although the opening momentum of Shuang Ma was tight, retail investors cashed in their profits. The opening price was 1,465 yuan, with more sellers than buyers, and it loosened to 1,458 yuan. Then it was heard that Guang merchants Sheng Yuan and Sheng Mu were trading Shuang Ma more actively, and the buying momentum was particularly strong. The market price rose step by step, rising to 1,475 yuan. Those who made profits in the middle closed out, and it loosened again to 1,464 yuan. The closing price returned to 1,472 yuan. According to statistics, 9,800 bales were traded in half a day, of which 1,300 bales were purchased by Hong Kong merchants and 8,500 bales by domestic merchants.

The Shuang Ma standard yarn market was relatively flat. In the middle, due to good sales of spot yarn, it also saw an increase, but it weakened slightly in the afternoon. As a result, the July contract fell by 5 cents, and the August contract fell by 2 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 9,150 bales. The high, low, and closing prices for the day are listed on the left.

### Cotton Prices Advance; Trading Booms

Yesterday, the cotton market was even more prosperous, and sentiment remained excited. This was because factory demand was strong, and the rise in American cotton was even more intense, resulting in extraordinary prosperity for the public, and the trading volume suddenly surged. Especially fine lint raw materials have become the center of advancement, and prices have also increased by more than ten yuan. Coarse lint was also raised a lot. Yesterday, a total of 2,150 pieces and 198 bales were traded.

Another message: the Shanghai Bund foreign cotton trading, sentiment was excited, the market was lively, because overseas procurement was quite troublesome, at the same time American cotton repeatedly rose, and the yarn market situation has been unfolded in a favorable condition in recent days, predict the future of the cotton market, it should be prosperous undoubtedly.

The New York cotton market, due to weather reports favorable to the long side, and good cotton cloth trade situation, fellow industry members bought very hard, therefore the market situation repeatedly lively firm increase, as a result the closing price, compared to the previous day, rose 17 to 25 pounds (British) or so.

The Indian cotton market, first fell due to scattered retail selling and continuous switching of contracts by buyers, but then rose again due to speculators covering white rots for new blooms. Yesterday's closing price, except for white rots for July and August falling half a rupee, the rest rose by 1 to 4 rupees. It is also predicted that today's opening market situation will be 2.5 rupees higher.

### Piece Goods; Trend Flat

The factory cloth market yesterday was stable. Nanyang merchants continued to purchase vigorously. Coarse cloth factory plates were not loose, and the prices of hand-held goods rose again, by 1.5 to 5 cents per piece. Fine cloth twill bleached and dyed cloth was flat. Shangshen poplin, such as the warp and weft factory's 80-count and 60-count goods, all rose by 1 to 2 yuan per piece. About 200 pieces of various cloths were traded in this street. Nanyang merchants purchased about 200 pieces of lightweight coarse cloth bleached cloth, etc.

The East Market was flat without honor or disgrace. Although the price of Shuang Ma yarn rose frequently, it still could not arouse the interest of hoarders. Fellow merchants also sold at high prices and had no desire to enter, so the closing price of the leading fine cloth store, Baihuo, was 44 yuan, 7 jiao, and 7.5 cents, only rising by 2.5 cents. Four Gentlemen serge circulated at around 1 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen, with the evening closing price at 1 yuan, 4 jiao, 5 fen, and 1.25 li.

### Sugar Market; Exchange Sugar Settlement Price Official Method; Has Not Yet Been Publicly Announced

The Sugar Industry Association's futures sugar dispute was resolved through public discussion and settlement, but the resolution has not yet been publicly announced. Therefore, there is no lack of opportunities to deceive customers. For customers whose short positions are profitable, the settlement method of the association is used as an excuse to reduce the profits they should have received. For customers whose long positions lose money, the method of reducing the price is omitted, and the settlement price is generally 93 yuan, or the transaction is settled flat without settlement, and they still have to pay all the losses. Therefore, some customers have expressed dissatisfaction and hope that the association will publicly announce the resolution to avoid confusion and trickery.

The sugar market was weak at first and then tight yesterday, and as a result, there was not much ups and downs. The Association's drawing rate, spot 24 coarse white, the initial price of new goods from foreign stores was only 89 yuan, then it turned tight to 89.5, 90, and 91 yuan. The 3/4 month old goods opened the weakest, only 86 yuan, then rose to 87, 88, and 89.5 yuan. Dutch red remained soft at 68 yuan, 2 yuan smaller. Tai Koo Cart White was without weight, B mark 108 yuan, DY mark 95 yuan, HX mark 88 to 89 yuan, the factory's first ice 124 yuan, Jingming ice 125 yuan, National Sugar reported from customers, because the domestic sales price was higher, so although it was shen, it was said that Dia Qing's transportation to Shantou even reached 88 yuan, and white sugar was 145 yuan, so the price difference was very large.

### Dried and Preserved Goods; Longxi Longan Has Poor Harvest

Longxi produced longan, the texture is also not bad, but the particles are smaller only. According to a letter from the production area, the new flower seedlings are very thin, only 10% to 20%, so the price of old goods is very tight. If the wholesale sector will carry out autumn sales activities in the future, the future market looks promising.

### Newly Offered Fetal Membranes

Cooked bamboo shoot clothing is also known as fetal membranes, the first batch of new goods only arrived recently at five pieces, each piece about 100 market pounds.

### Municipal Council Actually Approved; British Tram Company to Increase Fares; Scheduled to Be Implemented on the 28th of This Month; Salary Increase Proposal for Council Members Has Not Yielded Results

The British-owned Shanghai Electric Construction Company and Tramways Company, in the Concessions, had previously made excuses of high prices and insufficient income and expenditure, and repeatedly increased prices in order to obtain more profits. Recently, the price of rice has been suppressed by the authorities purchasing and transporting foreign rice to Shanghai, and other prices have also fallen. In theory, these public transportation enterprises should also automatically reduce prices to reduce the burden on citizens. However, the Tramways Company instead used the excuse that the exchange rate continued to fall and expenses increased, making it difficult to maintain operations, and requested another price increase. As a result, the public opposed it. Unexpectedly, the Municipal Council meeting the day before approved the proposal and scheduled it to be implemented on the 28th of this month. Therefore, the burden on the general public will not only not be reduced in the future, but will also increase compared to the past. There is a deep regret over the Municipal Council's move. The Municipal Council's announcement issued yesterday is recorded below:

Tram Price Increase Scheduled for Implementation

According to the Municipal Council's announcement, the Shanghai Electric Construction Company presented that due to the continuous decline in the exchange rate, coupled with the impact of the foreign war situation, various operating expenses have not increased sharply, making it difficult to maintain operations. Therefore, a request has been submitted to the Bureau for permission to increase tram fares, which is calculated as an increase from an average of 6.37 cents per mile to 9.11 cents for the first class, and from an average of 4.87 cents per mile to 7.29 cents for the third class, to increase revenue and supplement funds. It is found that the company's income has failed to meet the increase in expenditures since 1917. At present, expenses are about three times more than in 1937, of which a significant part is the electricity bill, which has increased more than four times. However, during the same period, the number of fare increases was only 153%, which caused the company's net profit from investment to decrease year by year. This net profit, which was 8.5% in 1936, was reduced to 1.3% last year. After the Bureau's Public Utilities Committee held a meeting to discuss, it was considered that the requested price increase was in compliance with the provisions of the franchise agreement and should be approved. It has been forwarded to the Bureau's Board of Directors for approval at the regular meeting on the 11th of this month and will be implemented from June 28th.

Salary Increase for Staff Decided

According to reliable sources, the Municipal Council has not reached a resolution on the salary increase proposal submitted by the Council's銓敘委員会. The salary increase issue will be discussed again at the next regular meeting. It is not yet possible to know for sure, but reliable sources indicate that the discussion of salary increases will be postponed indefinitely. It is reported that the銓叙委員会 proposed to increase the living allowance of 150% for all Council members, but it is not clear how much the increase will be. Some say it will be increased to 170%, while others say it will be doubled.

### British Horticultural Society Moves Venue; Changed to Haig Road Haig Garden; Date and Time Remain as Originally Scheduled

The Horticultural Society, organized by Mrs. Matheson, a British resident in Shanghai, was originally scheduled to hold a horticultural competition on the 18th of this month in the French Concession, at 118 Route du Père Robert, which was borrowed from Mr. Mores. The proceeds will be donated to the British War Fund. However, due to the Syrian political developments, the French Concession authorities feared possible friction between the British and French residents in the city and prohibited the competition. The competition has now been moved to Mr. Haigh's Haig Road Garden. The date and time remain as originally scheduled without any changes.

French Concession Forbids British Fundraising

The French Concession authorities issued an order the day before prohibiting the British in Shanghai from sending people to raise funds in the French Concession for relief efforts for the British war effort. This order came into effect yesterday.

### London Broadcasting Corporation Broadcasts Chinese Program; Next Program to Broadcast "Intestine Flower"

The local Democracy Radio Station, call sign XCDN, frequency 1440, in addition to news reports, has added two more times at 7:45 in the morning and 11:50 at night. Other entertainment programs are also gradually increasing. Yesterday (Wednesday) at 6:15 in the afternoon, the radio station rebroadcast the Chinese program of the London Broadcasting Corporation, which was exceptionally clear. It is heard that when the London Broadcasting Corporation broadcast the Chinese program the night before, the radio station's technician recorded the London broadcast onto a record and then rebroadcast it yesterday, so it was so clear. It is also heard that next Monday at 5:00 in the afternoon, Ms. Yuan Meiyun, the protagonist of "Xi Shi" and "Intestine Flower," has been hired to broadcast and sing the theme song of "Intestine Flower." Starting at 6:30 on Tuesday afternoon, Gu Yelu, the protagonist of "Wild Rose," will be hired to broadcast the one-act play "The Executioner."

### Asiatic Petroleum Company Downsizing; Waterworks Labor Unrest Rises; Chinese Business Labor Modifies Conditions

Yesterday, the various unresolved labor-management disputes were still under negotiation. The Asiatic Petroleum Company had a dispute over downsizing, and the comrades of the Commercial Press made concessions on the conditions, which are recorded as follows:

Asiatic Petroleum Company

The authorities of the British-owned Asiatic Petroleum Company in the city have said that they are going to downsize staff. Upon hearing the news, the staff were shocked and uneasy. After a meeting, they delegated representatives to present three requests to the company's manager, Mr. Bouville: (1) Each laid-off employee should be given 2,000 yuan in severance pay; (2) The savings deposits should be given out; (3) Those who continue to serve should have their salaries increased by a certain amount. The company was required to give a satisfactory reply by noon today, otherwise the staff may take drastic action.

Water Company

After the labor unrest occurred among more than 200 temporary workers of the British-owned Yangshupu and Jiangxi Road Water Companies, at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, more than 80 temporary workers gathered at the gate of the water company's storage place on Xinzha Road, demanding a response from the management. However, the office said that it had no right to respond, and because the workers were gathering in increasing numbers, which was hindering work, it telegraphed the police to send a large number of detectives to disperse them. A dispute once occurred at the time, but fortunately, it did not cause any trouble.

Commercial Press

In the Commercial Press labor unrest, in order to show sincerity and seek a solution as soon as possible, the labor side revised the previous six articles into three: (1) Comrades who are laid off and those who are transferred and do not want to go will be given an additional year's salary (including rice subsidies and temporary salary increases) and the arrears of wages after the August 13th Incident will be returned, but if the total of the two items is less than 1,200 yuan, it will be made up to that amount; (2) When the company needs to add staff in its business, it should absolutely employ the comrades who were laid off and those who were transferred and did not want to go this time. Only after all the above-mentioned comrades have been employed may new staff be hired. Before the above-mentioned comrades have been fully employed, the company's work may not be contracted out to parties outside the company; (3) Maintain the minimum wage rate for existing comrades. Please forward it to the labor party by the industrial section of the labor bureau, according to the industrial section, provisions 1 and 3 can still be consulted, company no. 2 has repeatedly firmly stated that there is no need to talk any more about this. The labor party considers that this provision should not be rejected by the company in terms of morality and reason, because the labor party is aware of the company's current difficulties and recognizes that it is reducing staff. In the future, when the company needs to add staff in its business, it would be better to employ old staff than to employ new staff, because they are familiar with the work and it would be beneficial and harmless to the company. Moreover, most of the staff have been working for more than 20 years. Once they leave, how can we bear it? Therefore, if this article is also rejected, it is obviously malicious, and the labor party will sacrifice everything to achieve its goals.

Shaphal Works Labor Unrest

All the workers of Shaphal Works demanded an increase of 1 yuan and 1 jiao per person per day for rice subsidies last month, but the management only agreed to 4 jiao, which led to labor unrest. The two sides have been deadlocked until now for more than half a month. It is now known that the labor unrest was resolved a few days ago, and each person will receive a uniform increase of 5 jiao per day for rice subsidies.

### Among the Four Foreign Ships Detained, Two Have Been Released; Cargo Has Not Yet Been Claimed

The four ships that were previously detained in the Zhoushan waters and later sailed to Shanghai, Changde, Ave Maria, Ammanley, and Baoli, could not regain their freedom because the Japanese did not allow them to unload their cargo. According to shipping industry news yesterday, the Ave Maria and Baoli have recently unloaded their cargo at the Yangshupu wharf under Japanese supervision. As for all the cargo, the Japanese considered it to be contraband and did not allow the shipping company or cargo merchants to claim it. Although the company has negotiated, it is still invalid. It is also known that the Japanese have stated that if they want to claim it, they must meet certain conditions, but the cargo merchants cannot do it because the losses are too great, and the water acquisition has not been resolved. Therefore, there is actually little hope of unconditionally recovering the cargo. As for the two ships, they have been released from supervision and are now moored at the Pujiang buoy. The cargo of the remaining Changde and Ammanley has not yet been unloaded. It is said that they are currently moored at the mouth of the Wusong River, and the Japanese do not allow them to unload their cargo there.

### Centralized Slaughter of Pigs May Be Abolished

The Shanghai slaughtering industry, fresh meat industry, and slaughterhouse were approved by the Municipal Council Board of Directors to lease the Hongkou Shajing Road slaughterhouse. In the future, the pigs in the British and French Concessions will be slaughtered in a centralized manner. If this is implemented, the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people in the industry will be cut off. Representatives were elected to petition the Municipal Council. Because the lease of the slaughterhouse has not yet been signed, the Municipal Council agreed to find a way to provide relief. The industry has also negotiated, and in the future, the slaughter of pigs must be restored to the pre-war state. At the very least, the area south of the Suzhou River must maintain its current state. If the goal is difficult to achieve, the entire industry will be shut down. It is now known that this case has been considered and may be abolished the centralized slaughter of pigs.

### For Navigation and Remittances in Occupied Areas, No Chinese Make Remittances

### Children's Hospital Hopes for Assistance from All Circles; Some Equipment and Furniture Were Searched

Dr. Chuan, the President of the Shanghai Children's Hospital at No. 11 Rue Molière, French Concession, announced yesterday that the matter of the hospital's equipment and furniture being forcibly removed has now come to an end. According to Dr. Chuan, a part of the equipment in the hospital has been taken away, but most of the equipment in the hospital is self-owned, so the hospital's operations will not be interrupted. He continued that the hospital is currently only lacking a microscope, an electric refrigerator, a sewing machine, as well as tables, chairs, and children's beds. At this time, the hospital will build another room and has been scheduled to start work today. It will take about three months to complete.

### Death of Fritz Rittmuller, General Manager of Deutsch-Asiatische Bank

Mr. Fritz Rittmuller, General Manager of Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, who resided in the Far East for several decades, passed away in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 6th of this month. His remains were buried on the 9th at the public cemetery on Jing'an Temple Road. He was born on March 14, 1874. After graduating from a local middle school, he entered a bank for an internship. Subsequently, in 1897, he joined the London branch of the old Deutsche Bank as a staff member. In May 1901, he began working at Deutsch-Asiatische Bank in Shanghai. After several years, he was promoted to director of the bank's Kobe office and was later appointed as a director. In 1901, he was appointed as the manager of the Yokohama branch. The following year, he served as acting manager of the Shanghai branch. In the same year, he married the youngest daughter of Mr. Du Hua of the French Municipal Council in Shanghai. From 1913 to 1935, he served as the manager of the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank in Qingdao. At that time, Qingdao was the German stronghold in the Far East. During the European War, Qingdao fell into Japanese hands, and he was captured and taken to Japan. After regaining his freedom, he returned to Qingdao to assist in the restoration of German commerce in China. Subsequently, he successively held the position of manager of Deutsch-Asiatische Bank in Hankou, Beiping, Kobe, and other places, and also held important positions in the Berlin branch. In 1934, he was ordered by the board of directors to inspect the branches of Deutsch-Asiatische Bank in the Far East and was subsequently appointed as the manager of the Tianjin branch. In January 1940, he was appointed as the manager of Deutsch-Asiatische Bank in Shanghai and concurrently as the general manager of the Far East. Mr. Rittmuller possessed extraordinary talent and foresight. He served Deutsch-Asiatische Bank for nearly 40 years, making outstanding contributions to the bank's planning and management, and made significant contributions to German commerce in the Far East. His sudden death is not only a great loss to the bank, but also deeply regretted by the Germans in the Far East, who have lost a leading figure.

### Establishment of Land Finance Department, Issuance of Land Bonds, China Farmers Bank Ordered to Handle, An Important Step in Rectifying Land Registration

The China Farmers Bank, under the order of the Ministry of Finance, has established a Land Finance Department with a stipulated capital of 10 million national currency, and has been formally established. Mr. Huang Tong is the director. The department has begun to provide long-term agricultural credit loans and has been specially approved by the government to issue land bonds. The types of loans are listed below:

Loan Types

(1) "Land Acquisition at Assessed Value" Loans: When the land value tax is implemented, people may underreport the value. Land administration agencies can request loans from the department to acquire land at the assessed value. Therefore, this type of loan aims to facilitate the implementation of the land value tax. (2) Land Expropriation Loans: The government sometimes needs to expropriate private land but is unable to provide fair compensation to landowners. If such loans are available, both the government and the people will benefit. (3) "Land Improvement Loans": For projects such as water conservancy and afforestation, the people's financial resources are limited, or the benefits are long-term. Therefore, the government needs to provide loans. (4) "Land Consolidation Loans": Land consolidation requires significant expenses, which private individuals cannot afford. Therefore, loans are needed. (5) "Loans to Support Owner-Cultivators": China has many tenant farmers. The government must use political and economic power to enable tillers to own their land. (6) "Land Registration Rectification Loans": Currently, land registration in many places needs rectification. After rectification, land tax revenue will definitely increase. However, due to insufficient funds, many projects have been shelved. Therefore, it is necessary to provide loans for this purpose.

### Bombing of Hanaoka's Residence, Truth Unknown, Rumor of Slight Wall Damage, No Injuries

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that a bomb exploded at the residence of Mr. Hanaoka Taro (president of Mitsui & Co. Shanghai), a Japanese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, at 112 Rue Cardinal Foch, at approximately 12:30 AM last night (the 11th). The sound was very loud. This morning (the 12th), the French police and Japanese authorities have launched an investigation and have taken special precautions at the residences of Mr. Okamoto, a Japanese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Mr. Yasuzo Yajima to prevent possible attacks. It is reported that no one was injured in the bombing, and only the walls suffered slight damage. According to this morning's reports, Japanese military police were the first to arrive at the scene after the incident and did not allow the French police officers who arrived later to investigate Mr. Hanaoka's residence. About an hour later, a Japanese major also arrived at the scene, and only then were four French police officers allowed to enter the residence to investigate jointly with the Japanese military police.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyun Ship Sold to Norwegian Merchant

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyun ship, which sails between Shanghai and Lianyungang and has a deadweight of 5,600 tons, was docked in Hong Kong after the war. It has recently been sold to the Norwegian company Erling for a price of 300,000 US dollars. The contract has been signed, and the buyer, Hualing Company, will inspect the ship and send it to the Taikoo Dockyard & Engineering Company for repairs. It is designated that the proceeds from the sale of this ship will be used to develop inland shipping, as there is a need to strengthen the efficiency of inland transportation tools. As for the four new ships, Yuan, Heng, Li, and Zhen, which were previously docked in Hong Kong, they were sold to the British company Jardine Matheson & Co. in 1938.

### Insurance Industry to Discuss Preventing Car Theft, Due to Numerous Recent Car Theft Cases, Rumors of Increased Car Insurance Premiums Incorrect

Recently, there have been widespread rumors that various insurance companies in Shanghai intend to increase car insurance premiums due to the numerous car theft cases. However, according to Mr. Sheehan, the manager of American International Assurance Company, yesterday told reporters that various insurance companies in Shanghai are not currently considering increasing car insurance premiums, as such a move would not reduce car theft. He said that although there are many car theft cases at present, the compensation paid by insurance companies is less than 2%. If insurance premiums were to be increased rashly for this reason, it would likely affect business prospects. In the past, when car theft cases occurred, they were often solved in a short period of time because thieves could not drive the cars out of Shanghai. However, the current situation is very different, and those stealing cars are organized gangs. It is said that they have the same keys for most new American-made cars in Shanghai, so car theft cases are frequently heard of. It is reported that the Insurance Association of America will soon hold a meeting to discuss this matter in order to take effective measures to prevent it.

### Mandalay Rice Can Be Shipped Soon, Price Already Set, Retail Price is 112 Yuan Per Stone

In addition to Rangoon Small Grain Rice, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession is continuing to procure Rangoon Special Mandalay Rice at affordable prices to help the people and ensure that rice prices are not manipulated by rice merchants and raised again. According to sources from the Ping Ming News Agency, the special Mandalay Rice that the council plans to procure has already been agreed upon with the Hong Kong government and will soon be shipped to Shanghai. As for the selling price, the agency acting on behalf of the council for the affordable rice has already set it. The wholesale price to grain merchants is 127.2 yuan per bag. The grain merchants must not sell it to retail rice shops for more than 136.25 yuan per bag. The retail price at rice shops is 112 yuan per stone. It is found that in the Japanese rice market, the price of Mandalay Rice is 117 yuan per stone, and the retail price at rice shops is generally over 120 yuan. Because the cost incurred by the Municipal Council is lower, the selling price is only 2 yuan higher than that of Small Grain Rice.

### Greater Shanghai Cinema Again Bombed, Fortunately No One Injured

The Greater Shanghai Cinema on Rue Chapsal in the Public Concession was previously bombed with smoke bombs. Unexpectedly, last night, when the film "Snow White" was being screened, at around 10 o'clock, someone threw a giant smoke bomb into the cinema. With a loud bang, smoke filled the theater. The audience was extremely frightened and rushed to escape, causing great chaos. Upon receiving the report, the police immediately dispatched detectives to investigate and maintain order. The fire department also sent ambulances to the scene. After investigation by the detectives, no one was injured, and the ambulances returned to the fire department. The bomber had already escaped without a trace.

### Victims of Panay Incident to Receive Medals from the United States

The crew and American citizens on board the U.S. gunboat Panay, which was sunk by Japanese aircraft in the Yangtze River a few years ago, will receive medals from the U.S. government. Each medal will cost 72 cents. The bill has been passed by the Senate and will soon be awarded to the victims.

### Fire at San Tong Bookstore

The San Tong Bookstore at 331 Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession caught fire suddenly at 11:38 last night. Thick smoke quickly filled the air, and the fire was intense. The fire department arrived at the scene after receiving the alarm and extinguished the fire in about half an hour. As a result, the bookstore's storefront was completely destroyed. When the fire was raging, two people jumped from the second-floor loft to escape and were slightly injured. They were taken to the hospital for treatment. It is said that no one was living in the bookstore at night. The police are still investigating how the fire started.

It is reported that the bank is ready and will open on the 15th of this month.

### Roulette Gambling Den Broken Up at 74 Nanyang Road, Operated by Two Englishmen on a Large Scale, Access by Password, Gamblers All Wealthy

Detective Liao Hua of the Public Concession Police, along with Detective Feng Qishan and Western Detective Wahl, recently discovered that a large-scale roulette gambling den was secretly opened in the D-character apartment at 74 Nanyang Road. Those who went there to gamble were all business tycoons, including managers of banks and large companies. The gamblers all arrived in the latest luxurious cars. The winnings and losses were recorded by signing notes. Each night, the table stakes amounted to hundreds of thousands. The gambling den was exceptionally well-equipped, with passwords required for knocking on the door, making it extremely difficult for outsiders to enter.

Operated by Englishmen

After a long period of investigation by the police, the number was finally discovered. At 10:15 PM on the 11th, they managed to sneak in. The gamblers were in high spirits and gambling. The detectives then began to arrest the people in charge: two Englishmen, W. Hawkins (who was previously fined five pounds by the British Consulate for operating a gambling den in the Cangzhou Hotel) and V.L. Xavier; four Chinese assistants in charge of gambling equipment: Chen Baodi from Wuxi, Zhao Guiqing, Wang Haili from Tianjin, and Bi Fugen from Shanghai; and nineteen gamblers, both men and women. The gambling equipment and thousands of chips were also seized and taken to the police station.

Wealthy Gamblers

Because the gamblers were all business tycoons, most of the names they gave were false. The names they reported were Wang Beidi (female) from Guangdong, Guo Mali (female), Guo Daola (female) from Shanghai, Guo Qiaoqi and his wife, Wu Junli and his wife from Jian (all listed the address as 110 Avenue Haig), Hu Huarong from Suzhou (26 Avenue Joffre), Lu Xuefei and Mrs. Lu from Shanghai (3 Lane 592 Rue Amiral Bayle), Meng Chao from Suzhou (22 Lane 67 Rue Amiral Bayle), Shen Youbo and Shen Wangshi from Suzhou (11 Tranquility Lane Seymour Road), Guangdong women Lin Zhen, Lin Hui, Wu Zhi, Zhang Xin (134 Poplar Lane Rue du Lieutenant Petiot), Cantonese man Liu Andu and his wife (905 Yu Yuan Road).

Separate Lawsuits

After investigation by the police, the two Englishmen were handed over to the British Consulate for interrogation. The four Chinese assistants were detained. The nineteen gamblers were each allowed to post bail of 500 yuan to avoid detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where Judge Meng Tingke presided over the hearing. After being released on bail, all the gamblers avoided appearing in court. Police lawyer Fang Fushu filed separate lawsuits on charges of assisting in the operation of a gambling den and gambling. He also stated that the property was owned by Wing Lee Real Estate Company and leased by an Englishman named Natto. Hogan, who was arrested, had admitted that Natto was his alias. However, the police knew that Hogan was not wealthy, and the gambling den was luxuriously equipped, which must have cost a lot of money. Therefore, they strongly believed that there must be a Chinese person as the behind-the-scenes boss.

Still Under Investigation

The situation was similar to the gambling dens broken up in the past. Therefore, the police need to investigate further and requested permission to postpone the hearing. Subsequently, Detective Feng Qishan reported the details of the case. Judge Meng interrogated the four, Chen Baodi. They were ordered to be detained and a new hearing was set for one week later. The police were also ordered to notify the defendants who had been released on bail that they must appear in court at the next hearing.

### Cutting and Stealing Electrical Wires, One Criminal Caught, Stolen Goods Found, and Eighteen Suspects Detained

The electrical wires installed by the Shanghai Power Company in the eastern and western parts of Shanghai have recently been cut and stolen by petty thieves, causing losses not only to the company but also inconvenience to users. On the 7th of this month, the Wayside Police received a report that a criminal who cut and stole electrical wires was hiding in Tangshan Road. The police dispatched officers to the address and arrested one criminal and 200 feet of stolen wire. The criminal confessed to repeatedly cutting and stealing electrical wires and selling them in the concession and western Shanghai. Subsequently, more criminals and eighteen suspects were arrested, and a large number of stolen electrical wires were seized. The police are still continuing to investigate the case and intend to apprehend all the criminals who cut and steal electrical wires.

### Tragic Situation Below the Poverty Line, Mother Pushes Deaf-Mute Daughter into River, Fortunately Rescued and Did Not Die, Pan Chen Shi Has Been Arrested Pending Investigation

Pan Chen Shi, a widow from Changshu, is forty-one years old and lives in a bungalow in Qingcheng Lane, Rue Pere Robert in the French Concession. She has a daughter named Miao Gen, who is fourteen years old. Because she is deaf-mute and cannot speak, she was fortunate that her family had some savings in her early years, so she was able to make a living. Recently, because her savings have been exhausted and the cost of living in Shanghai has increased, she has been unable to support herself. She then

Went Out to Work as a Servant

at the house of Mr. Lin Qiu, but her deaf-mute daughter Miao Gen cannot always be by her side. She was worried about this and came up with a strange idea. On the 15th of last month, she lured her deaf-mute daughter Miao Gen to a riverbank in Hongqiao. Taking advantage of Miao Gen's unpreparedness, she suddenly pushed Miao Gen into the river to drown her and avoid being a burden. Fortunately, after falling into the water, Miao Gen shouted loudly, and was rescued by someone, while Pan

Took the Opportunity to Flee

She was then sent to the Zhong Ci You Association and reported to the French police. It was not until recently that the French police found Pan Chen Shi's hiding place and arrested her. After investigation by the police, Pan Chen Shi confessed that she had no way to support her biological daughter due to the difficult living conditions, so she took this desperate measure. The police believe that Pan Chen Shi's actions are inhumane and have now filed a lawsuit against her according to law to show their deterrence.

Four sharp knives were seized. It was found that Bai was responsible for transporting munitions for these people. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi requested a postponement of the hearing on the grounds that the facts of the case had not yet been clarified. Judge Su then ordered a postponement of the hearing.

### How to Study English (3)

— Ye Jingfeng

This approach emphasizes the "ability" and "strength" of the teacher. It cannot be undertaken by teachers without special training and cultivation, and it is not easy to achieve results.

As for the textbook guidance method, the general mentality is to regard the teacher as a magician, hoping to completely rely on him to "turn stone into gold." This is probably a wrong mentality, because the teacher's responsibility is to guide and point out, not to manufacture. If you want to learn English well, nine-tenths of the work still depends on your own efforts and self-study. The so-called self-study is not a miserable pose of facing the wall for ten years, but a lively and interesting automatic work.

The above three conditions are all related to each other. Those who have not suffered hardships may not be able to experience it for a while. Those who have spun around and taken detours on the road of research will probably understand it at a glance. Next, let's examine the small shortcuts of reading, writing, speaking, and translating.

Read

(1) What to Read: Most of the school's textbooks are prescribed by the academic director and teachers and cannot be changed. Some schools are also very willing to respect the opinions of the students, and some teachers please the students, allowing them to choose textbooks at will. This is even more dangerous than prescribing textbooks. Young people's psychology is sometimes blind, sometimes fickle, and sometimes ambitious. These are all morbid mentalities.

I remember that students in a certain class in the past advocated reading English newspapers. The English in newspapers is extremely irregular and is listed as a taboo in rhetoric. New words, strange words, and obscure words are used, and even self-created words are used. Moreover, newspapers have their own documents, and nine out of ten are a bit glib. How can we learn from them? For example, it would be a joke to use cursive script as a model for learning calligraphy. Of course, there are occasionally neat articles in newspapers, but very few. As for learning some current affairs vocabulary, first ask if we need it.

Even magazine articles are generally not suitable for reading as textbooks. When you reach a certain level, you may be able to use publications such as Reader's Digest as supplementary reading material, but when you reach this level, our English knowledge may force us to explore better, more beautiful, and richer treasures.

What should we read after all? The simple answer is: (1) pure English, (2) standard textbooks and other reading materials compiled by standard authors, (3) selections suitable for your own level.

(2) How to Read: Our reading steps are often wrong. Nine and a half out of ten people first look up new words. After looking up the new words, they are already exhausted. This method is neither scientific nor logical. If we choose our textbooks appropriately, I believe that we should first read the entire article or chapter from beginning to end, once, twice, or three times. Although it may seem a bit superficial, it doesn't matter, because the purpose is to grasp the general meaning of the whole article. After grasping the general meaning, the second step is to find the paragraphs in the whole article (here, paragraph does not mean section). Mark each paragraph with a single word or a short sentence to indicate the subtitle. Then, the third step is to see how many sections are in this paragraph. Paragraphs and sections of short articles are mostly mixed. If it is a large paragraph, there may be two or three sections. We have to carefully find the main sentence of each section. This is not difficult, because in English writing, the main sentence of each section (that is, the main idea) is either the first sentence or the last sentence. It is rare to be hidden in the middle. Once we find the main sentence, we know what the section is about. Only then can we discuss each sentence in detail.

The Spring and Autumn Period

### "Eating in Restaurants" Appeals: Plain Noodles Jump a Corner, Six Major Hurdles

— Disheng

Stir-fried Meat Like a Kite with a Broken String

I remember two years ago, during the spring, when I first fled to the isolated island of Shanghai and started "eating in restaurants," a bowl of "plain noodles" was only seven coppers, and it was filled to the brim. The rice grains were white, large, and genuine Du rice. Just two bowls would make my belly tight and full.

Stir-fried meat was also seven coppers a piece, moderately fatty and lean, and as big as a dried tofu block. So two pieces of stir-fried meat and two bowls of "plain noodles" were enough for a hearty meal, costing only a dime. It was both decent and practical, and the waiter would greet you warmly, treating you like an honored guest.

But good times don't last, and the situation has been deteriorating. The "plain noodles" jumped from seven coppers to seven cents a bowl, and then soared to "jump out of the dime barrier," reaching the current peak of sixteen cents. At the same time, corners were cut, the flat-bottomed bowl was changed to a pointed-bottom bowl, and Du rice was replaced with second-grade foreign indica rice. Hong Kong rice was also mixed with broken rice, which was shallow and very rough. It took three or five bowls to barely feel not hungry. I'm not lying; it's definitely not really full.

The stir-fried meat is getting smaller, smaller, and smaller, to the point where you can't tell if it's a "piece" or a "strand." If there were a strong storm, I believe this thin slice of meat might fly straight to the clouds like a kite with a broken string. Adding a small tip is, as usual, non-negotiable. Now, a meal costs not one yuan, but nine mao. This small tip is enough for a meal in the past. I am a little envious of the waiter's position and lament my own inferiority.

These days, newspapers report "rice prices plummeting" and "vegetables crashing," but our restaurant owners don't seem to be as quick to react as they were when prices were raised before. "Plain noodles" are still sixteen cents, and still served in a pointed-bottom bowl, and still shallowly filled. The stir-fried meat naturally has no hope of returning to its old appearance. Even the vegetables are still the old price of twenty cents, hard as nails! They always maintain their "genuine non-negotiable price."

As someone who "eats in restaurants," I sincerely appeal to the restaurant owners here: raise prices when they should be raised, and lower prices when they should be lowered. Please reduce your money-making calculations a little and ease the burden on us small eaters. Doing good is the greatest joy, and that would be a great merit.

### Overture in Three Movements

— Hai Feng

In the past, when you met an acquaintance, the first thing you said was always, "The weather today is haha," and then; you laughed, I laughed, he laughed, and everyone laughed. It seemed that if you didn't open your mouth, you couldn't start any other way.

Now it's different. It's okay if you don't see people, but when you see people, you always unconsciously talk about life problems, and from life problems, you turn to the repeated breaking of rice price limits and the incessant rise in coal prices. Then, you sighed, I sighed, he sighed, and everyone sighed.

Recently, the rice from Hong Kong set by the Municipal Council has arrived, and the freight for transporting coal has also fallen. As a result, rice and coal prices have fallen sharply in recent days. Although the price of rice is still above 100, and the price of coal is still selling for fifteen or sixteen yuan per dan, it is still inseparable from the "real business" -- the difficulty of solving life problems. Everyone thinks that while rice prices are falling, the cost of living is rising instead, discussing each other, and finally you are angry, I am angry, he is angry, and everyone is angry.

### Letter from Sixty Apprentices: Beasts of Burden? or Paying Compensation?

Editor… We are also oppressed apprentices. Our wages range from four yuan to more than ten yuan per day. We work twelve hours a day, and our access to books and newspapers is extremely limited. In the past, for the sake of life, for the sake of obtaining the minimum amount of food to sustain life, we have always silently endured.

However, the bosses recently forced us to sign a so-called "voluntary agreement," the content of which is as follows:

1.  Must be between the ages of sixteen and twenty; be physically strong, have good character, have a junior high school education, and pass an examination. After a three-month trial period, they may become formal trainees.

2.  The training period for trainees is stipulated to be three years. After graduation, they must serve in the factory for two years. The factory is not responsible for any loss, natural disasters, or man-made disasters.

3.  Within the above-mentioned period, trainees shall not enroll in school or change careers, otherwise, they shall compensate the factory for tuition fees of one thousand yuan in national currency, and the guarantor shall be responsible for this.

4.  Trainees who pass the examination by the general manager at the time of graduation will be given a certificate and promoted to staff members. Those who fail will have their term extended or be dismissed altogether.

5.  Trainees are not allowed to privately hoard money. All funds due to them from the factory shall be deposited in a savings account. If they need items, they may apply to the general affairs officer to handle them. (Omission)

Here, we have no freedom to study on our own in our spare time, we have no freedom to use our own wages; and most importantly, we must unconditionally sign a five-year contract of servitude. …

Sir! Please think about it, what kind of life should we live under such conditions?

But, likewise, for the sake of life, for the sake of obtaining the minimum amount of food, we were prepared to accept it: But when we went to ask our guarantors to provide a guarantee, their replies were all: "Yes, you can, as long as you give me one thousand yuan, I will guarantee you." Sir! Where do the workers get one thousand yuan? We were thwarted. When we were thwarted everywhere, the factory not only did not understand, but also set a deadline to submit it by the end of this month, otherwise, we would be fired. This really made us "have no way to go to heaven and no door to enter the earth."

Sir, we want to live, we are willing to work. In order to obtain the minimum amount of living materials, we are even prepared to sacrifice our entire happiness, but now everything is completely over. The boss's iron wrist is holding our sixty lives tightly. We do not have one thousand yuan, and we are watching unemployment and displacement right in front of us. What lies before us is the road to death.

But we want to live, we want to live. … With the greatest hope, we write to you, sir, asking you to publish our letter and appeal to society on our behalf, asking righteous people to lend us a helping hand. …

Respectfully wishing you good health!

### Miss's "Routine"

— Xu Ping

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(9) A Farmer from an Ancient Marsh

In the blink of an eye, it was the cold winter season again. This evening, Xiao Meibao, as usual, took out the photo album left by Xiangqi, looked through it again, and leaned on the warm kang, chatting with Begonia about her mother, long mother, and short mother.

"Didn't I tell you just now that Mother is even taller than Da Jiazi!?" Today, Begonia was really troubled. After Xiao Meibao had repeatedly asked him the same question three or four times, the tone of his answer was unknowingly much harsher than usual.

Three days ago, he heard this news:

"The situation in Beijing has changed drastically. The Revolutionary Army has been attacking from the south since the end of last month. The five-colored flag has also been abolished, and hanging it again will result in being shot. Male and female revolutionaries are everywhere. The officials who used to be in office have all been kicked out. Several banks have also collapsed. Rich people have to face lawsuits. Each farmer cannot have more than ten mu of land. Any more than that will result in being dragged to stand in a wooden cage…"

This was said by a Shandong man who was accustomed to selling large silks in the countryside. Judging from Begonia's knowledge, most of it was of course laughable rumors. However, the overall situation had changed, which could definitely not be fabricated by a broker.

"Several banks have also collapsed…"

This sentence made Begonia feel the most uneasy.

And today, the quick letter he received from Zhao Si indeed confirmed what the Shandong man said. He said that the Eastern Province Colonial Bank had collapsed following the retreat of the × army, and the Fuhua Bank was also showing very unstable news due to the downfall of ××× and ×××. These two were precisely where Begonia had stored his only savings! Therefore, according to Zhao Si's meaning, he himself should go there immediately to avoid total annihilation. (131)

The Entertainment World

### Hollywood News Chronicle

— Qinghui

Running a Side Business

Hollywood Chinese photographer Huang Zongzhan, in addition to working on the photography set, has actually opened a restaurant in the bustling downtown area of Hollywood, called Qing Howe Cafe. Many movie stars attended the opening day. John Garfield and James Stewart were the two most enthusiastic. Everyone personally helped to pick dishes and move rice, and each wore a Chinese-style melon-skin hat, expressing admiration for the great spirit of the Chinese nation.

International Family

The family of comedian Mischa Auer can simply be called an international building, because the people living in it include seven nationalities. He himself is Russian, his wife is British, their servant is German, the children's nanny is Finnish, the cook is French, the gardener is Japanese, and the ranch manager is Swedish. Therefore, he can speak the languages of these seven countries.

Self-Recommendation

In the past, it was often very difficult for producers to ask a star to take on a certain role; but now all these difficulties have been overcome. Many stars are practicing self-recommendation. For example, Joan Crawford, when she read the script for "The Women," asked to play the harlot Crystal. Also, the role of Susan in "Reunion in France" was also obtained at her request, and both achieved great success. Also, Hedy Lamarr's co-starring with James Stewart in "Come Live with Me" was also successful due to Hedy's self-recommendation.

Baby Elephant Dies

MGM has a baby elephant star whose name is Bady Bea. She was only three years old and made a brief appearance in "Tarzan Finds a Son." She recently died suddenly. However, the company is eager to film a new Tarzan film, so it urged the zoo director Imerson to find a replacement, but he has not yet found one.

New Work Renamed

Shirley Temple has joined MGM, and her first work was originally scheduled to co-star with Miguel Toronchikara in "Panama Hattie." But according to MGM's latest confirmed news, it has been changed and will co-star with Huarez Piel in "Lazy Bone."

### Zha Ruilong Leads Guanghua Art Troupe Abroad

Martial artist Zha Ruilong has progressive ideas, is enthusiastic about sports, and especially loves art. He has led art troupes on tours to various ports in Southeast Asia, where he was well-received. The overseas Chinese giant Wang Chaozhuan in the Philippines believes that Mr. Zha has been back in China for several years, and the overseas Chinese and local people miss his demeanor and hope that he will travel south again. He has sent repeated telegrams inviting him. Mr. Zha cannot refuse the sentiment, and since it is this time, rather than living in isolation on the island, he would rather avoid the noise overseas. He has decided to lead the Guanghua Art Troupe (formerly the Guoguang Troupe led by Mr. Zha) to perform in Cebu, Iran, and other places in the Philippines. He is currently busy preparing, and will set off as soon as he is ready. It is heard that the Guanghua organization includes techniques, singing, dancing, magic, etc.? Among them, Zhang Suzhen, Yin Jin, and Chen Peiyu's singing and dancing, Zhu Enrong, Zhu Yulan, and Zhu Wangzhen's techniques, and Li Menghuan and Huang Yushu's magic are all said to be superb. With such a strong lineup, led by Mr. Zha to perform, it will surely cause a sensation everywhere and return with honor.

Chapter Ten: Gongsun's Sword Qi First Appears, Part One

Liu Yining repeatedly declined and deferred, but could not refuse, so he had no choice but to, along with Wang Yongtai, Xu Jing, and others, partake in the sumptuous banquet hosted by Zhou Yuji within the yamen. Several subordinate generals, Zhang Lie, Fan Cheng, and others, accompanied them at the feast. Cups were raised and exchanged, and host and guests alike were filled with joy until dusk before the banquet dispersed. Xu Jing and Liu Yining, along with Wang Yongtai, thanked Zhou Yuji and departed. Having left the yamen gate, Liu Yining still intended to return to the mountain. Wang Yongtai said, "It is already late. Why bother returning at night? Last night, the family elder of Liu was not informed clearly. I presume arrangements have been made today. Please come to my humble abode to rest for the night, and return to your residence tomorrow." Liu Yining initially declined, but after Xu Jing insisted on him staying, he accompanied Xu Jing to Wang's residence. Wang Yongtai had already instructed servants to clean the guest room where Xu Jing had stayed previously, preparing it for the two of them to lodge. When Liu Yining initially heard that he was to share a room with Xu Jing, he seemed displeased. He said that he had a peculiar habit of always sleeping alone and could not share a bed with others. Xu Jing then spoke to Wang Yongtai, who arranged for an additional bed, to which Liu Yining reluctantly agreed. As night deepened, Xu Jing, having been sleepless the previous night and having drunk quite a bit of wine today, felt very tired and yawned repeatedly. He hung his sword on the wall and urged Liu Yining to rest. Liu Yining sat quietly, backlit by the lamp, his head lowered, not speaking. Xu Jing said, "Today's banquet was most enjoyable. General Zhou treats people with great sincerity, which is why his soldiers are willing to risk their lives. If the rebel Chuang were to attack Daizhou, it certainly would not be easy for him compared to other places. Tonight, I am weary and wish to sleep. Dear brother, please rest early." Liu Yining said, "Brother Jing, please sleep first. I still wish to sit quietly for a while before retiring." Xu Jing did not understand what Liu Yining meant. Thinking that this was his nature, and feeling very tired himself, he undressed and went to sleep. When he woke up the next day, he saw Liu Yining lying on the other bed, facing the wall, wrapped in a thin blanket, still sleeping soundly. He thought to himself that the weather was very hot, yet he was still covering himself with a blanket, truly unafraid of the heat. He got up and dressed, quietly walking to Liu Yining's bed. He saw his eyes slightly closed, his cheeks slightly red, and a very white and delicate arm exposed outside the blanket. The sleeping posture looked just like a woman, and his heart couldn't help but stir. Not daring to disturb him, he walked out to the courtyard to take a stroll and breathe some fresh air. When he returned to the room, Liu Yining was getting up. Seeing Xu Jing, he hastily put on his outer robe and said with a smile, "Brother Jing, you are up early. I overslept." Having spoken, he slipped on his shoes and went outside to relieve himself. (88)
