### US Secretary of State and British Ambassador Confer on Grave Situation in the Far East

Australia Prepares to Mobilize 600,000 Soldiers

Cabinet Also Convened a Special Meeting Today

Washington, 10th (United Press) - British Ambassador to the U.S., Lord Halifax, yesterday conferred with Secretary of State Hull for 45 minutes regarding the Far Eastern situation. It is understood that the two also discussed the Soviet Union issue and the latter's supply problems, including the aid that Britain and the U.S. can provide to the Soviets. Dutch Minister Loudon also met with Hull, it is said.

Adelaide, 10th (United Press) - Australian Prime Minister Menzies yesterday requested that the Federal Cabinet convene an emergency meeting on Monday. It is believed that Menzies' request indicates that the government considers the situation in the Pacific has worsened.

Brisbane, 10th (United Press) - American cruisers that recently visited Australia yesterday sailed to "an undisclosed location."

Canberra, 10th (United Press) - The government reported yesterday that Australia has 600,000 soldiers ready for full mobilization. This number indicates that Australia has brought its national manpower under control, engaging in military service, war industries, and all aspects of society on a war footing, it is said.

Melbourne, 10th (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Menzies has suspended his tour of all parts of Australia due to the increasing tension in the Pacific situation and is scheduled to return here tonight. The cabinet will hold a special meeting tomorrow.

Sydney, 10th (Reuters) - Australian Foreign Minister Sir Stewart declared that the phenomenon of Japan's continued southward advance means the continuation of the tense situation. Japan once cried out about being encircled as an excuse to seize bases in Vietnam, and is now adopting the same pretext to cover its plan to expand its power to Thailand. Japan must know that the only encirclement it fears is the union of countries that feel threatened by its aggression, and Japan should bear the responsibility for causing this union. Japan can see from the warnings of the British Foreign Secretary and the U.S. Secretary of State that any action to encroach upon Thailand is a grave and direct threat to the interests of Britain and the United States, and will cause serious consequences. To avoid these consequences, Japan has full control, it is said.

The Far Eastern Situation Has Become Serious, British-Owned Japanese Nationals Prepare to Withdraw

Stockholm, 10th (Haitong News Agency) - According to the London correspondent of a Swedish newspaper, in the view of British political and military figures, the Far Eastern crisis has entered its most serious period. The evacuation of Japanese nationals from Australia, India, and Burma sufficiently demonstrates the tension of the situation. Japanese shops in India have already begun to dismiss staff, preparing to close down. Japanese shipping companies and Japanese nationals in Australia, India, and Burma are eagerly booking passage back home. Regarding the results of the talks between Britain and the United States on the Far Eastern issue, London has not been able to obtain any fragmentary information. London officials are maintaining strict silence on this matter. The reason is obviously that British authorities have not yet contacted the representatives participating in the negotiations, so they have not yet learned of the results of the negotiations. London believes that the government does not need to maintain constant contact with the representatives participating in the negotiations, because the British representatives participating in the meeting are very capable, but the list of British representatives has not been disclosed. It is also impossible to know the whereabouts of President Roosevelt's special envoy, Hopkins, in London at present, it is said.

Philippine Soldiers and Civilians Actively Prepare to Cope with Future Crisis

Manila, 10th (Reuters) - The seriousness of the situation is generally recognized, but the Philippines has not yet been disturbed by the future crisis on the surface. Military and civilian authorities are very active. Civil authorities are beginning to organize civil protection matters, such as stockpiling food, training residents, lighting control, air raid defense, and other matters. As for military plans, they concern U.S. policy and are not allowed to be disclosed. What is known is only the publicized methods. The most important of these is that the Philippine Army's regular and reserve soldiers will be incorporated into the U.S. Army at the end of this month, and the Philippine military camps will be taken over by the U.S. military on September 1. Communist members in the rural areas who were elected as mayors swore an oath when they first met with President Quezon, willing to jointly resist the almighty forces with the United States and the Philippines, and representatives of the Labour Party also made similar expressions to the U.S. military commander. From this, one can get a glimpse of the attitude of the Philippine people towards the situation. Recently, some Spanish and German people have applied for Philippine citizenship, but many people consider it suspicious, because many of them have relations with the Fascist Party. The local Civilian Liberties Union has requested all citizens to provide information on those applying for citizenship who are politically unqualified, and has requested the government and private institutions to eliminate employees with Axis and Fascist affiliations. Generally speaking, the public sentiment in Manila is now very calm. A trial air raid drill was held last week with good results. The newspapers unanimously support the U.S. Far East policy, and although they discuss the war in detail, they do not favor any side, but they do express sympathy for Britain. Since Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, public opinion has also had a good impression of the Soviet Union.

Washington, 10th (United Press) - Secretary of State Hull said yesterday that it is too early to say what definite plans there are regarding finding a way to send ships to welcome overseas Chinese who urgently want to return to their country. He also said that what he discussed with Ambassador Nomura on Friday was the details regarding ships.

### Canada Announces Freezing of Raw Silk

### Duff Cooper Arrives in the US from England

New York, 10th (Reuters) - British High Commissioner Duff Cooper, who is going to Singapore to take up his new post, will arrive here tonight by clipper. After staying in New York for a short time, he plans to go to Washington, and after completing his official business, he will start his journey to Singapore.

### US to Implement Economic Sanctions Against Japan's Invasion of Thailand

If Japan Does Not Do This, the US May Provide Convenience

Washington, 10th (International News Service) - According to reliable sources here last night, if Japan attempts to invade again, especially if it infringes upon Thailand, the government plans to implement strict economic sanctions against Japan. The US will stop issuing permits for the free import of raw silk, unless the current tension in the Pacific is reduced. It is said that if the Japanese do not attack Thailand, the US government will consider resuming normal "peaceful trade" with Japan. The US will also allow the import of unrefined oil from before the war, and will allow the Japanese to purchase products from the Philippines. The US will not allow the Japanese to use the benefits of trade with the US to enhance their military establishment. This is the position adopted by the US government. What the United States fears most is that Japan will attack Singapore as an important step for the Axis powers to control the ocean. President Roosevelt has begun to prevent this. If the four major powers of the Far East, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, can unite in the Pacific, then Japan will never dare to fight, and war may be avoided as a result.

Rome, 10th (United Press) - Turin's "La Stampa" newspaper wrote in a commentary yesterday that if Britain thinks of undermining Thailand's territory, Japan will enter the war. The newspaper said, "Japan obviously will not be taken advantage of by other countries, especially since that country has now occupied bases in Vietnam and has direct contact with Thailand. If Britain thinks of invading this Asian nation in any way, Tokyo will intervene. After President Roosevelt and Churchill issued warnings of war, would they be willing to encounter a full-scale war in the Far East?"

Rome, 10th (United Press) - Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, wrote an article in the "Italian Daily" yesterday, accusing Britain of doing its best to expand the war, drawing Thailand and the Soviet Union into the Far Eastern war. He said, "The situation in Thailand, its complexity and danger, has been increasing day by day. Britain is applying political and military pressure on Thailand, and it is rumored that it has asked Thailand for the right to occupy important military bases in 'this neutral country.'" He also said, "The reason for Britain and the United States raising this demand is to claim that Thailand is threatened by Japan, but in reality, Britain intends to draw Thailand into its political system and into the vortex of war. However, Japan cannot maintain a passive and indifferent attitude towards this. Britain is hoping that Japan will make a natural and necessary retaliation for this, so that it can expand the conflict in the Far East," it is said.

Tokyo, 10th (Haitong News Agency) - The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" stated that Japan will never allow Britain or the United States to undermine Thailand's independence. Any action taken by Britain and the United States against Thailand will be met with a response from Japan. The Thai government has recognized that Thai-Japanese cooperation is the only way to maintain the new order in the Far East. After obtaining Japan's help, Thailand is strong enough to cope with the pressure exerted on Thailand by Britain and the United States.

Thai Cabinet Meets to Discuss Countermeasures

Bangkok, 10th (Reuters) - The Thai Cabinet held a special meeting yesterday morning, lasting for three hours, and the diplomatic community was also very active throughout the day. This shows that the authorities are now carefully observing the overall situation, not slacking off in the slightest. According to a newspaper here, 25 Japanese military officers, traveling in eight large military aircraft, have landed at the Viangchan airfield on the northern border of Vietnam. This place is being rushed to build an aviation base. People here are paying close attention to this move. The painful memories of Viangchan during the recent Thai-Vietnamese war have not yet been forgotten by the Thai people. It is rumored that these people do not feel happy about this recent development.

### US Inventing a Powerful Weapon to Detect Enemy Aircraft

Washington, 10th (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of the Army said that coastal areas and overseas bases will soon have a newly invented secret device to detect the movements of enemy aircraft, working continuously every day. This new device can issue warnings before the enemy approaches, similar to the new British-made radio detector, it is said.

### Japanese Artillery Unit Returns to Saigon

Saigon, 10th (Reuters) - A large batch of Japanese artillery units dragged by horses returned to Saigon yesterday morning and re-boarded ships, probably to advance via the Mekong River crossing, or because the horses could not withstand the current humid and hot climate. According to reliable sources, the Japanese are currently building a large fort at Cape Saint Jacques.

### The International Situation Amidst the Churchill-Roosevelt Meeting

The most noteworthy event in the international arena recently is not the urgency of the Far Eastern situation, nor the great battle between the Soviet Union and Germany in Ukraine, nor the rumor that German troops will occupy French West Africa via Spain, but the meeting between the British and American authorities that has been shrouded in speculation. The various situations listed above should indeed be recognized as important and have significance in influencing the future world situation, but they are all facts that have already developed or are developing. Their trends and changes are obvious. The talks between Britain and the United States are believed by everyone to be a fact and are certainly a major key to the future situation, but apart from some speculations or inferences, no official news has been revealed to the end. From this, one can realize that the significance is so great that it cannot be compared to the routine meetings such as those at the Brenner Pass. Since President Roosevelt set sail on a yacht on the 3rd of this month, his whereabouts have been kept secret, and for the first time, reporters were not allowed to accompany him. Then, Deputy Secretary of State Welles, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Marshal Stark and Arnold, the top leaders of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, all left the capital together. British Prime Minister Churchill, after US Special Envoy Hopkins flew away from the Soviet capital, mysteriously disappeared, and his whereabouts were unknown. He did not even attend the British Parliament's debate on the war situation. Now that the two have been away from their national capitals for a full week, and the meeting has become an open secret, the governments of both countries are still keeping tight-lipped and avoiding the issue as much as possible. Although this is the due prudence in wartime, it also shows that the nature of the meeting is extremely important. According to what the White House Secretary O'Leary announced at the beginning of Roosevelt's trip, today is the scheduled date for his return from his vacation. The issues to be discussed and decided should have come to an end after several days of discussion. According to yesterday's United Press London news, it is believed that from this week onwards, Japan will no longer be able to doubt the determination of the democratic countries. From this, one can probably get a glimpse of the results of this meeting.

Now let's turn to the current international situation. Summarizing the dynamics of all parties, it should be confirmed that the eve of the final settlement between aggression and anti-aggression is approaching, and it is also the period when the aggressors are trying their best to break out and save themselves from their misfortune. The Axis's launch of the invasion of the Soviet Union has trapped itself in a mire of prolonged bitter fighting, which once made its Far Eastern allies feel caught between a rock and a hard place. On the other hand, it has given the democratic countries more sufficient time to prepare. Objectively, it has also added the Soviet Union's vast manpower and material resources to the anti-aggression front. However, these are all the results of the failure of Britain's peaceful offensive and the failure of the blitzkrieg strategy against the Soviet Union, which Hitler did not expect. Unable to launch a full-scale offensive, it changed to a breakthrough in the middle and a sudden attack on Moscow. After encountering setbacks in Smolensk, it changed again and stepped up its invasion of Odessa. After such repeated changes in strategy, without asking how this will determine the fate of Ukraine, the reputation and vigor of the Panzer troops are no longer what they used to be. On land, the British army has not yet launched a counter-offensive, but in the air, Berlin has already tasted the taste of being attacked on two sides. If this situation continues to stalemate for another month or two, it will be difficult to say how the Nazis will maintain their rule. Therefore, Hitler cannot but seek a favorable way out other than stepping up the attack on the Soviet Union. The seriousness of the South Pacific crisis is certainly beneficial to the Axis. But while it still regards the attack on the Soviet Union as the most important task at present, it also needs to take action in other areas, especially the Atlantic, to contain Britain and the United States' active aid to the Soviet Union, and at the same time make the United States face the difficulty of dealing with both sides. This is the only assistance that the Nazis can provide to their Far Eastern allies when they are being "encircled." According to the analysis of the Reuters military commentator a few days ago, the Nazis still have such strength at this moment. The turmoil in the Vichy regime, the crisis in de Gaulle, and the instability of the situation in Iran should all be regarded as important parts of the current volatile international crisis. But the most dangerous and urgent place is still the Far East. Regardless of the true situation and development of the so-called "encirclement" or "counter-encirclement," the extension of the military base from the northern border of Vietnam to the Gulf of Siam, the reaffirmation of the tripartite alliance and the so-called "new order," and any expression that the "encirclement" is too small to make it turn back, all prove that the Far East is approaching a critical moment of transition from appeasement to decisive action when viewed in contrast with the parallel statements issued by Eden and Hull on the 6th of this month regarding the current situation in Thailand. If a new incident breaks out in the Far East, it is expected that the Axis powers in Europe will also do their best to engage in a last-ditch effort.

Comparing the current international lineups of the two sides, one side is a trapped beast fighting, and the other side is like a new sword being sharpened. Whether in terms of strength or situation, there is a huge disparity, and there is no possibility that the adventurer will succeed by chance. However, in the past, the democratic countries had weaknesses such as being passive, slow, indecisive, seeking temporary stability, and having uneven steps. This is probably where the aggressor front places a glimmer of hope. However, this situation is constantly changing, and no person or country can maintain the status quo forever. In the past month or so, one can see everywhere that the role of the democratic countries is undergoing a dramatic change. It is believed that this meeting between the British and American authorities is aimed at the entire international crisis, and they will pay special attention to the most tense places, and the arrival of a new segmented situation is probably not far away.

### Hundreds of American-Made Medium Bombers Begin Shipping to the Soviet Union

Washington Announces Transfer by British

British and Soviet Air Forces Jointly Bomb Berlin

United Press, Washington, Tenth: Authoritative sources stated yesterday that warplanes made in America are already en route to the Soviet Union. They also stated that the Defense Committee has completed its procedures for transporting medium bombers to the Soviet Union. This batch of warplanes was originally ordered by Britain, but Britain has agreed to transfer them to the Soviet Union. There are several hundred of these planes. The number being shipped this time is not known, and how they are being transported has not been explained in detail. They may be shipped on cargo ships sailing across the Pacific Ocean. Experts say that it is also possible to fly them from Alaska, across the Bering Strait, to bases in Siberia. It is said that the Soviet Union purchased this new batch of planes with cash. Soviet leaders told the United States that they were not concerned about military stockpiles being useless, but stated that the material losses suffered by both Germany and the Soviet Union were "considerable."

United Press, Rome, Tenth: A well-known Italian commentator, Malavoglia, declared yesterday in the "Forum" newspaper that the United States intends to acquire Vladivostok in exchange for aiding the Soviet Union against Germany. He said that Japan is currently closely monitoring developments in the Far East and will do everything possible to prevent the United States from acquiring this important base.

TASS, Moscow, Tenth: Last night, Soviet planes attacked Berlin for the second time. Incendiary bombs ignited military targets and railway tracks. German anti-aircraft fire was very weak. All Soviet planes returned to base. Only one is missing.

United Press, Moscow, Tenth: On Friday night, the Soviet Air Force bombed Berlin three times. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky warned yesterday that Soviet planes would continue to bomb Berlin. He also said that Soviet air fleets would never stop attacking German rear areas, especially targeting the bases of German air fleets.

Reuters, Moscow, Tenth: Last night, German planes attempted to raid Moscow. Eight of them were shot down by Soviet forces. According to the Soviet official TASS news agency, on the evening of August 9, German planes attempted to enter Moscow, but only a few planes managed to penetrate the city's airspace.

Britain Will Provide the Soviets with Photos of Bombing Targets

Reuters, London, Tenth: According to a dispatch from the Swedish capital, the Soviet planes that bombed Berlin on Thursday night were the same type of planes that flew over the Arctic before the war. A dispatch from the Daily Telegraph reported that Soviet planes carried incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs, fiercely bombing factories and power plants on the outskirts of Berlin. A total of three Soviet plane formations were involved in the attack, all four-engine heavy bombers. They took off from bases on the islands of Osel and Dago in the Baltic Sea off the coast of Estonia, completing a 1,200-mile round trip to Berlin without interception or loss. The report stated that the German side was trying to conceal the fact that the attackers of Berlin were Soviet planes, first claiming that the attackers were the British Air Force, and then claiming that the attack was only a German Air Force night exercise aimed at testing the effectiveness of new night air defense equipment. However, the German anti-aircraft artillery teams were caught off guard and did not have time to open fire, and the German night fighters took off too late and did not have time to intercept the Soviet bombers, indicating that the Soviet air raid was completely successful. A dispatch from the Swedish capital to the Daily Mail reported that the British had provided the Soviets with photos of Berlin's military targets taken by the British Air Force, and that the attack on Thursday night was the beginning of a joint large-scale British-Soviet air raid on Germany. According to a dispatch from Berlin to the Swedish newspaper Aftontidningen, the German side recently refuted the Soviet claim that Soviet bombers had reconnoitered German territory on Thursday night, saying that it was cloudy that night and reconnaissance was not possible. The dispatch did not specify which side's planes were involved in the attack on Berlin on Friday night, only stating that at least Berlin's anti-aircraft artillery did not open fire, and some planes flew to Berlin, but were prevented from dropping bombs.

### Soviet and German Armies Stalemate on an 1,800-Mile Front; Fierce Battles Underway in Ukraine

United Press, Moscow, Tenth: Yesterday, Soviet and German armies completed their seventh week of bloody fighting, with a stalemate on the 1,800-mile front. The German army concentrated its main forces in Ukraine and on the northwestern front lines of Kholm. The fiercest battles were in Ukraine, where Marshal Budyonny seems to have checked the German army in the areas of Korosten and Belaya Tserkov (the German side claims to have captured Korosten). According to news from the front lines, since the German 14th Panzer Division launched its offensive, it has caused the Soviet side to lose 150 tanks in two days of major battles. The Soviet high command stated that the German army's fierce attacks on Ukraine and Smolensk have not yielded any significant gains, and that many German tank and infantry divisions have lost 30% to 40% of their strength. These figures have been confirmed in captured German statistics.

TASS, Moscow, Tenth: A Soviet Information Bureau report released on the ninth stated that last night, our army engaged the enemy on the Kholm, Smolensk, Korosten, Belaya Tserkov, and Estonian fronts. There was only patrol activity in other areas. Our air force, in conjunction with the army, struck enemy mechanized units and infantry units, and bombed enemy airfields.

TASS, Moscow, Tenth: A Soviet Information Bureau report stated that fourteen German planes were destroyed yesterday, and our side lost twelve. In addition, the previous report of eighty-one German planes destroyed the day before yesterday and thirty-one the day before was incorrect. The Soviet Red Navy sank one enemy torpedo boat and destroyed two in the Baltic Sea, and bombarded enemy cargo ships.

TASS, Moscow, Tenth: A city on the Western Front: Yesterday, Soviet and German tank units engaged in another battle. The Soviet tanks led by Trotsenko attacked a large unit of German tanks, destroying fifteen German tanks and halting the enemy's advance.

### German Army's Southern Advance Aimed at Odessa

Reuters, London, Tenth: A special communiqué from the German High Command announced news of a major defeat of the Soviet army, stating that the Soviet army southeast of Smolensk had been surrounded and destroyed, with 38,000 Soviet soldiers captured, and a large number of armored vehicles and artillery seized. In addition, the German army also captured Korosten in Ukraine. According to London sources, the German army's slight progress in southern Ukraine is probably aimed at the Black Sea port of Odessa. Apart from this, there have been no major changes along the entire front from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. The German side makes no mention of its own losses, while the Soviet Union openly admits its losses, claiming 600,000 dead and wounded, indicating that the Soviet side is confident in the strength of its forces. The German army is facing increasing difficulties due to harassment by Soviet guerrillas and resistance from the Polish people. If Polish resistance to the German occupation forces spreads further, the German army's transportation through Poland to the Eastern Front will be greatly affected. The Finnish communiqué also echoed the German line, stating that military operations are proceeding according to plan, and that Soviet resistance is quite stubborn. Details of the fighting and locations are not announced to avoid providing information to the enemy. Soviet air force continues to be active, especially on the Finnish front lines, as Soviet planes have been transferred from bases in Estonia.

### Soviet Guerrilla Units Active in the German Rear

The Soviet side seems to have moved its troops and war materials from the ports of Estonia to other places by sea, as its land retreat route has been cut off by the German army. The German army is said to have already reached Taiba, to prevent the Soviet side from leaving troops in the Estonian maritime bases and continuing its guerrilla warfare elsewhere. The Finnish communiqué also stated that the Finnish army's attack on Soitelava is currently underway, attempting to find weaknesses in the defense line. There is nothing to report elsewhere except for fighting in Hango. The Soviet defense forces in Hango have probably received assistance from fresh troops transferred from Estonia. Although the German High Command announced that the battle near Smolensk has ended, details of guerrilla activity in the Belarusian province and the Far Eastern border continue to be transmitted to Moscow. The province is at least thirty miles behind Smolensk. According to a phone call from a Communist Party secretary in the province, guerrilla units are still active in the German rear, with units of hundreds of men, numbering in the thousands.

### Many German Warships Destroyed in Six Weeks of War

Red Fleet reported that, in a statement of a certain captain, that in the six weeks of war, many German warships were destroyed by Soviet warships and aircraft, including thirteen submarines, thirteen torpedo boats, three escort ships, one minesweeper, and over thirty transport ships. Germany, under attack from Britain, cannot move its larger warships to the Baltic Sea, and only a few submarines from Romania are concentrated in the Black Sea. Also, according to a message, as of August 4, a total of fourteen German submarines had been lost.

TASS, Moscow, Tenth: The Soviet guerrillas on the Northwest Front are extremely active, especially adept at night attacks. On the night of the seventh, a guerrilla unit raided a German headquarters, suddenly occupying it, obtaining a large number of documents and destroying two tanks.

### Red Army Braves Fierce Charges on Southwest Front

TASS, Moscow, Tenth: The Red Army fought bravely. Yesterday, on the Southwest Front, under heavy Romanian artillery fire, a Red Army soldier named Prusakov voluntarily sneaked into the enemy's lines, killing the enemy artillerymen with hand grenades, destroying four artillery pieces, and carrying several undamaged cannons back to the Soviet positions. Also, Red Army soldiers Boyekin and Nikolsky saw that their commander, Lysenko, was trapped in an enemy encirclement. They fearlessly charged into the enemy's lines with bayonets. Boyekin was unfortunately wounded, so Nikolsky fought alone, stabbing four enemy soldiers to death with his bayonet, and rescued his wounded comrade, carrying him back to their own positions.

### German Delegation Arrives in Turkey

Havas, Istanbul, Ninth: Two German planes flying to the Turkish capital landed here recently, carrying a German delegation of several people to Ankara to discuss a certain agreement with Turkish authorities.

### British Army to Launch Large-Scale Offensive in the Near East

Preparations for Invasion of Europe Intensifying; German Troops Rush to Norway as Reinforcements

Havas, Alexandria, Ninth: According to observations here, the British army will soon launch a large-scale offensive in the Near East. Recently, several convoys filled with military equipment, escorted by British naval and air forces, arrived here and turned toward the Mediterranean.

Reuters, New York, Tenth: The Business Week reported that the latest indication of British preparations to invade Europe is the Central Supply Committee's request to the U.S. Administration to prioritize the supply of tanks and bombers.

Reuters, Transvaal, Tenth: South African Prime Minister General Smuts stated in a speech here yesterday that a land invasion of Europe is currently necessary, but he is unable to confirm it. In his view, the air force's attack on Europe has already begun. This offensive will be carried out on a large scale, inflicting a fatal blow on the enemy. This could eliminate the need for a land invasion. Air superiority is the decisive factor in today's war. He believes that Britain will win, and South Africa will contribute to the final victory.

Havas, Stockholm, Ninth: Military observers here are paying close attention to the news that the British and American navies will take military action in northern Norway and that American reinforcements have arrived in Iceland. A portion of the British garrison in Iceland has been replaced by American forces, which will reach 70,000 men. At the same time, airfields are being built to use the air force to assist the navy in patrolling the Atlantic. The German side has also been strengthening its defenses in northern Norway and rushing to build fortifications at the submarine base in Trondheim. German reinforcements are also rushing to Norway.

### De Ru Attacks the Caucasus: Turkish General to Join the War

United Press International, Cairo, 10th: Yesterday it was reported that Hitler and his generals discussed launching a blitzkrieg across the Bosporus, through the Caucasus, to attack the southern flank of the Soviet forces. If they take this action, Turkey will join the war on the side of Britain and the Soviet Union. I have just returned from a three-week trip to Turkey and even went to the Bulgarian border. The military observers and officials I met and spoke with unanimously held the above view. I believe the Turkish government and army are eager to maintain neutrality and are determined to resist any aggression. The Soviet Union's resistance has sapped the spirit of Hitler's blitzkrieg tactics in the Eastern war, thus encouraging Turkey. The more firmly the Soviet Union resists, the more confident Turkey becomes in maintaining its neutrality. In my opinion, the Soviet Union's decision to resist has convinced Turkish public opinion that the British Empire will defeat the Axis powers. This optimism has also given hope to the invaded Balkan countries to rise up.

United Press International, Ankara, 10th: Diplomatic circles yesterday unanimously believed that the Anglo-German diplomatic and propaganda war in Turkey and Iran would reach a new peak by the end of August. It is widely believed that Turkey and Iran may become battlefields for Britain and Germany. Axis figures questioned Britain's reinforcement of troops in northeastern Iran and its preparation to attack northwestern Iran to establish contact with the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union collapses, Britain can also assist in destroying the oil production centers of Beitum and Beigu. German propagandists are trying to incite Turkish people against British actions in Iran, promising that if the Soviet Union is defeated and Britain is forced to sue for peace, Germany will cede Beitum, Beigu, Georgia, and Azerbaijan to Turkey.

### The Americas Expand Territorial Waters

Havas, Brazilian Capital, 9th: The Neutrality Committee of the American countries held a meeting here today. The Chilean representative proposed expanding the territorial waters of the American republics from three miles to twelve miles from the coastline. The Uruguayan representative advocated expanding it to twenty-five miles. As a result of the vote, the representatives finally passed the proposal made by the Chilean representative.

### Mother of Maginot Passes Away

United Press International, Vichy, 10th: Parisian newspapers announced yesterday that Madame Maginot, the mother of the creator of the Maginot Line, has passed away.

### An American Reporter in China Describes the Scenery of Hong Kong (Part 2)

Scenery on the Border

The road from Happy Valley is a winding path that leads you through a mountain pass to the other side of Hong Kong. Below are many crescent-shaped coasts, but now the beaches are all equipped with barbed wire barriers. At both ends of the beach, there are hidden ammunition boxes that can fire directly onto the beach.

Behind the other coast, there is a golf course surrounding two bow-shaped lands. This golf course is situated on a green lawn between the mountain and the sea. Regardless of the weather, the British like to play here. Above the golf course, you can see the large houses that dominate Hong Kong from the mountain peaks. If you are dining in a large room that can accommodate fifty people, you can easily be shocked during the meal, as long as a six-inch shell is fired from a nearby battery, it can explode here immediately.

Across the bay to the New Territories, you can eat at a country store, which is a very magnificent Chinese temple, roofed with lead pipes, American-style. After the meal, people separately took four cars to the border. The British came to hunt, moving along the mountains in pink clothing. The car road passes through vegetable gardens and brown, barren mountain tops. Within half an hour, you have reached the border. On the other side of a small river and a row of barbed wire is the Japanese-controlled area. The border divides a main road in the village into two.

A Major Thoroughfare

Hong Kong is wealthy, and the symbol of wealth is the vast HSBC Bank, a white building topped with a skyscraper, dominating the entire Hong Kong. The bank paid out a dividend of $3.5 million this year. There are many other banks in Hong Kong: Hong Kong is the banking and insurance center of South China. You have never seen any factories manufacturing cement or firecrackers. However, foreign freighters load goods worth over $140 million each year. These freighters pass through the port and dock on the Wanchai side; the goods are then transshipped to various provinces in South China, the Indochinese Peninsula, the Philippines, Java, and other ports in the East. More than 3,500 ocean-going vessels enter and exit each year.

The war in China has forced millions of Chinese to seek refuge in Hong Kong and the New Territories. Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, it is generally believed that five hundred wealthy individuals have fled here for safety. If not millionaires, most are homeless and penniless refugees. Hong Kong has become the last place they can go. The terrible crowding is now making the residents of Hong Kong even poorer. People cannot rent a room, they only rent a corner of a room. In one room, ten to twelve people sleep at the same time in dim, unventilated cubicles separated by curtains, looking like dirty train bunks. The houses have dark, damp cement walls and floors, no gutters, and a greasy, narrow ladder leads to the mixed rooms. Beds are placed haphazardly on top of the ladder.

Defending Hong Kong

Last summer, the British government ordered women and children staying in Hong Kong to evacuate. Within forty-eight hours, three thousand women and children prepared to set sail for Australia. Only current caregivers can stay here. Most people believe that this sudden evacuation order had one purpose: to tell others that Hong Kong is prepared to deal with any attack. Since then, the British have laid mines in the harbor and straits, deployed submarine nets, built air-raid shelters, buried munitions, installed heavy artillery, searchlights, and anti-aircraft guns, and erected barbed wire on potential landing areas and roads across the island. They have stored a large amount of gasoline and food, and organized a people's volunteer army to assist the regular army.

Strategically, Hong Kong is not very important to Britain. However, it is very important to Britain's reputation in the East and is the last commercial base in China. Anyone who lives here for a few weeks can understand their policy. (The End)

Widespread extreme poverty in Hong Kong. This is a street where peddlers gather, and there is a hairdresser to comb their hair. Dirt, disease, and poverty are the fate of most Chinese people.

The mansions atop Hong Kong's mountains are extremely luxurious. The picture shows the private residence of Sir Robert Ho Tung.

### Rumor of Secret German Troop Movements Advancing Southward Through Spain

The Objective is to Occupy French Dakar

British Authorities in Gibraltar are Consulting

International News Service, Washington, 10th: It was learned late last night in American diplomatic circles here that German troops have passed through Spain, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar, and reached Morocco, and are now en route to Dakar. Just as the world's attention is focused on the Soviet-German war and the recent Japanese invasion of Vietnam, a German armored division, including 1,000 tanks and motorized vehicles, is rumored to have entered Morocco. According to observers here, this news is a secret action by Germany in response to the American occupation of Iceland, and to prevent the American occupation of Dakar. Washington officials declined to comment on this. It is claimed that President Roosevelt and the State Department have repeatedly warned Vichy and Portugal that any change in the status of Dakar and the Azores would be considered a serious military threat to the United States. However, if France and Portugal do not resist, the United States may not take any action against Germany. It is rumored that Spanish leader General Franco has agreed to cooperate with Germany in any actions against Dakar and French Morocco. It is also rumored that Germany has promised to give Spain a portion of French Northwest Africa in exchange.

International News Service, Vichy, 10th: The important cabinet meeting has been postponed. It is rumored that they will succumb to German pressure and allow Germany to use African bases, the most important of which are Dakar and Sablanca. Before the postponement of the cabinet meeting was announced, Vichy sent a note to the United States in response to America's concern over the colony. Although the content of the note has not been made public, it is expected to reiterate France's determination to defend its colonies against any aggression.

Reuters, Gibraltar, 10th: British Ambassador to Spain Hoare arrived here last night from Madrid and will consult with Gibraltar Governor Lord Gort here later this week.

Postponement of French Cabinet Meeting

Havas Agency, Vichy, 9th: The Council of Ministers, originally scheduled to be held today, was generally regarded as extremely important given the presence here of General Weygand, the government's commissioner for North African territories, and the return of cabinet minister Darlan from Paris. However, the meeting was suddenly cancelled, and it is not expected to be convened before the 11th of this month. Therefore, the current situation is unlikely to become clear until after two or three days. At this time, due to official silence, it is extremely difficult to ascertain the future development of the situation. Darlan exchanged views with various cabinet members last night, and will continue to do so today. In general, a conclusion can be reached during the cabinet meeting. Political figures were very active today. Pétain continued to consult with Weygand and Darlan. The public gathered outside the head of state's residence, all wanting to catch a glimpse of the important figures. When Deputy Commissioner Pujol and Minister of Justice Barthélemy arrived at the entrance, the crowd cheered and paid their respects. Barthélemy went to the head of state's residence to discuss issues of international law, as France still wants to adhere to the French-German armistice agreement in both spirit and letter, and it is necessary to consult this expert on public law. General Weygand and Minister of the Army Huntziger did not leave the head of state's residence until the afternoon. The talk of a cabinet reshuffle that Parisian newspapers have been advocating in recent days has subsided today.

### American Shipyard Workers Strike

Reuters, Philadelphia, 10th: A spokesman for the U.S. Navy said yesterday that work at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard has been greatly hampered by a strike. The strike involves 348 people, including many carpenters, who refused to comply with the notice issued by their national union regarding overtime and Saturday work conditions and did not come to the factory yesterday. The superintendent of the shipyard has reported the matter to the Maritime Department in Washington.

Reuters, Kearney, New Jersey, 10th: Workers at the Federal Shipbuilding Company, with the support of shipbuilding union president Green, continued their strike, causing work to stop. The Newark Evening News reported that, according to sources in Washington, the U.S. government is prepared to take over the shipyard at the request of industrial organization local congress Vice President Flynn. At the same time, work on aircraft worth $100 million undertaken by the Curtiss Company's New Jersey factory has almost completely stopped because workers in one part of the propeller manufacturing unit are demanding higher wages and two-thirds of them have gone on strike.

### United States Fully Controls Steel Use

Reuters, Washington, 10th: The Production Management Bureau yesterday placed all types of steel under full government control. Defense Priority Administrator Stettinius issued a control order due to the gradual shortage of certain steel products. All steel production must be prioritized for defense purposes and important decisions are made by the people. It also stipulates that steel mills must accept defense orders, and are not allowed to refuse even if it hinders non-defense orders. In addition to orders placed by the U.S. Army and Navy, orders from Britain or other countries under the Lend-Lease Act also have priority. From September 1, purchase orders for steel must be accompanied by a special form proving its use.

### Many American Congressmen Will Visit Iceland for Inspection: Roosevelt's Yacht Now Anchored in Fog

Hull Avoids Answering Questions on Anglo-American Talks

Reuters, New York, 10th: According to a Washington dispatch from CBS, many members of the U.S. Congress will soon travel to Iceland to inspect the new bases built by the United States in Newfoundland, Greenland, and Iceland.

Reuters, Washington, 10th: A telegram from the President's yacht said that the yacht was anchored in fog and that the weather was not suitable for fishing yesterday. Everything on board is quiet and there is no special news.

United Press International, Washington, 10th: Secretary of State Hull avoided answering reporters' questions yesterday about Roosevelt's whereabouts and the alleged meetings. As for the recent rumors of "Anglo-American talks" to warn against further Japanese aggression, Hull said that this issue has not yet been considered.

International News Service, Washington, 10th: The general public is now planning to stop speculating about the mystery of Roosevelt and Churchill's meeting. However, high-level sources are increasingly convinced that the two are either in talks or will be meeting soon. Neither Washington nor London has denied the rumors, and the news censorship office has allowed most rumors to be published. The President himself has not mentioned the rumors. The general public speculates that Welles and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark, Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, and Air Force Chief of Staff Major General Arnold are all on the President's yacht meeting with senior British officials.

### British Planes Bomb Northern France

Axis Bases in North Africa Also Heavily Attacked by the British

Reuters, London, 10th: British Air Force fighters escorted bombers to northern France yesterday morning. Due to the clouds, it was impossible to see the targets, but military targets near Gravelines were bombed. British fighters engaged in dogfights with enemy fighters, and ten enemy planes were destroyed. The eleventh was destroyed by a British patrol plane near the French coast on Saturday afternoon. Ten British planes did not return. The British Air Ministry's intelligence department said that on Friday night, a British plane bombed two German supply ships in a Norwegian port north of Bergen. One of them was hit, and thick smoke rose. On Saturday evening, British fighters conducted offensive patrols over the Strait and northern France, destroying seven more enemy planes. Therefore, a total of eighteen enemy planes were destroyed on Saturday.

United Press International, Cairo, 10th: Heavy bombers of the Royal Air Force's Middle East Command heavily attacked Axis bases in Africa on Thursday evening, bombing the central church and embankment of Benghazi and causing fires in the Tripoli dock area. An official bulletin also stated that on Friday, a British bomber damaged a motor vehicle carrier in Bardia, killing and wounding a hundred enemy soldiers. During the German Air Force's attack on Alexandria on Thursday evening, a Junkers 88 German plane was shot down in combat. All British planes returned safely.

### Bombing Incident at Vichy Synagogue

Havas Agency, Vichy, 10th: A bombing incident occurred at the synagogue here last night. The material damage was very minor, and there were no deaths or injuries. According to semi-official sources, this was caused by conspirators attempting to disrupt the political situation.

### British Government Funds Compensation for Civilian Air Raid Losses

People Do Not Suffer the Misery of Displacement and Are Better Off Than Those in German Shelters

United Press International, London, 10th: The heavy bombing of Britain by German planes has never slowed down British production, nor has it crushed the British people's animosity toward the enemy. However, these air raids have cost the British government and people hundreds of millions of pounds. It is impossible for us to obtain a complete official figure. If the air raids of the coming winter are as fierce as those of last winter and spring, the amount of money spent by Britain to compensate for losses may be the same as the national debt. People here believe that Britain's method of compensating for destroyed houses and clothing with cash is better than Germany's method of collecting the homeless in specific shelters. Because such simple places inevitably cause pessimism among air raid victims, officials here who are responsible for compensating war damages have already felt that if they can pay out cash as soon as possible after the victims' applications are approved, the people will never be pessimistic or despairing. The experiences of many air raids in London have already shown that if people who have suffered from air raids are given money by the government to buy food and clothing, they can still be as calm as normal people.

### Japanese Report British Warship Found in Gulf of Siam

Japanese Newspapers Believe the Warship's Purpose is to Demonstrate Against Thailand

Reuters, Tokyo, 10th: Both the Jiji Shinpo and the Kokumin Shinbun reported this morning that a reporter from a certain foreign news agency in Shanghai had heard that a British warship was found in the Gulf of Siam, and said that this ship must be the HMS Warspite, which was injured in the Battle of Narvik last year and is going to Singapore for repairs. It deliberately appeared in the Gulf of Siam in order to threaten Thailand, but the scars on the waterline of the ship are still visible. The Yomiuri Shimbun also carried this news and published a photo with the title "Cunning Britain's Threat to Thailand," and said that this ship was damaged by the Italian side in the Mediterranean and is now going to the United States for repairs. The Jiji Shinpo also mentioned that this ship may be destined for the United States, and the Japanese semi-official news agency broadcast that this ship was sailing from Manila to the west coast of the United States in order to repair it because Singapore does not have the necessary repair materials. The purpose of this ship's appearance in the Gulf of Siam is to demonstrate against Thailand, but it is heard that Thailand has decided to share the responsibility of establishing the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere with Japan. Japanese newspapers are now continuing to attack Britain and the United States by using the rumor of the British warship HMS Warspite appearing in the Gulf of Siam, accusing them of putting pressure on Thailand in order to encircle Japan. The Jiji Shinpo said that Thailand has a strong navy as its backing, so there is no danger of resisting Britain and the United States. Thailand's independence is necessary for the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.

European War Talks (74)

### Liaison Officer of the Democratic Front

U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt dispatched special envoy Harry L. Hopkins to London in January of this year to meet with Winston Churchill to convey the U.S.'s intention to assist the democratic front. In July, he sent him to Moscow to meet with Stalin to convey the same mission and he may visit Chongqing in the future. This figure travels busily between the capitals of the democratic front, and can be described as a popular figure in international affairs. His background is introduced as follows:

Hopkins was initially not a prominent figure. However, he and President Roosevelt are close as family members. Among the thousands of officials under the President, none can compare to him. Others may hold high positions, be influential on the political stage, or have outstanding reputations in society, but Hopkins is the only guest besides the Roosevelt family who can stay at the "White House" for a long time. The close relationship between him and the President can be imagined.

The President sees guests from nine o'clock in the morning to nine o'clock in the evening every day, all of whom are prominent celebrities and outstanding politicians. But when he finishes his official business, closes the door to guests, and sits down to rest, the one who is qualified to have a heart-to-heart talk with him is his old friend Hopkins. The President and him are close friends, as close as father and son. But how did they get to this point? Hopkins is rich in understanding and good at being considerate. If the President has anything on his mind, he will not guess unless necessary, and once he guesses, he is right. Some compare him to the President's trusted confidant Corydon Meharry Howe, and there are indeed many similarities.

Experienced American politicians have great respect for Hopkins. When he first arrived in Washington in early 1933, people did not know his real name without an introduction. Even after learning about his origins, people simply regarded him as a follower of the President's "New Deal" movement.

At that time, the figures who planned the New Deal around Roosevelt had a so-called "brain trust," and people speculated about the members. Raymond Moley was one of them, and he was a famous individualist. In addition, Rexford Guy Tugwell was outstanding in character and beautiful in appearance. A.A. Berle (now Assistant Secretary of State) was dedicated and had the demeanor of a scholar.

As for Hopkins, he also has his strengths, but they are different in nature from the people mentioned above. Until he lived in the White House as the President's confidant, he always seemed unremarkable on the surface. His clothes could not hide his thin elbows and knees. He looked exactly like a farm boy singing ditties. If it weren't for his focused eyes and particularly long face, he would have no striking features. But perhaps because of these characteristics, he was able to fight his political enemies in three hundred rounds and recover his health from a near-death illness last year.

He has been unruly since his youth, but he is not reckless, and he is alert in dealing with matters, and sometimes uses spicy methods. It is no coincidence that he was recognized by the President, from a small social worker to a minister, to the President's most trusted advisor, and even a liaison officer for the countries of the democratic front related to the fate of the world.

Iowa is a place where talents emerge. Ambitious young people in the state all take New York as a place for development. Hopkins was born in Sioux City, Iowa, fifty years ago, into a poor family. After graduating from Grinnell College in Iowa, he went to New York to make a living like other Iowans. He first worked as an investigator for the "Poor Relief Association," the largest private charity in the country. At this time, due to his work, he discovered the contradictory phenomena in society, where the rich lived extravagantly and the poor could not guarantee their lives in the morning. He spontaneously developed infinite sympathy for the general poor, which was the cause of his later efforts in social relief work.

This young Iowan strives to improve himself in the new environment. In 1915, he became the director of the New York Children's Welfare Bureau, and was only twenty-five years old at this time. After 1922, he served as the executive director of the New York Tuberculosis Prevention Association. His scope of activities gradually expanded and attracted Roosevelt's attention. At that time, Roosevelt, the new Governor of New York, appointed him as the director of the New York State Temporary Emergency Relief Administration, and he was like a fish in water, able to give full play to his ambitions.

His work in New York was only a stepping stone to his later power in Washington. In May 1933, President Roosevelt took office and brought a group of talents to implement the "New Deal." Hopkins was summoned to the capital, and was just an unknown soldier among the various authorities. When President Roosevelt recommended him to the Senate Banking and Currency Committee as the director of the Federal Relief Bureau, the members of the Senate looked at each other in confusion about this unfamiliar name.

### US Medical Association Strengthens Organization to Increase Aid to China

Newly Established Eight Standing Committees Divide Responsibilities

Over One Hundred Health Clinics Established in China

New York News - The Board of Directors of the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, in view of the growing expansion of its affairs, found it necessary to adjust internally and expand its organization in order to cope with the complex tasks and to increase the effectiveness of fundraising for aid to China. At the annual meeting of the Board of Directors last month, Director Meng Zhi and others proposed the addition of various standing committees and the expansion of the National Committee, among other suggestions. These proposals were deemed urgently needed and were unanimously approved. The American Bureau for Medical Aid to China is a leading organization in the United States for public support of China. It is believed that this adjustment and expansion will lead to significant progress in the future.

Strengthening Organization and Enhancing Power

The American Bureau for Medical Aid to China is a legally registered organization in New York State. Its internal organization originally consisted of the General Assembly, the Board of Directors, and the Executive Committee as its administrative system. After this reorganization, eight new standing committees were established, including Fundraising, Organization, Finance and Budget, Account Allocation, Procurement and Collection of Accounts, Medical Affairs, Community and Public Relations, and Administration. This aims to achieve the benefits of division of labor and cooperation. Furthermore, the original National Committee of the Aid to China Bureau, composed of national leaders who are enthusiastic about supporting China and sponsoring the organization, aims to assist in the development of the Aid to China movement. It is now planned to enrich and expand it to seek an unlimited increase in its power.

Aid to China Funds Exceed One Million

The American Bureau for Medical Aid to China was established in September 1937 and has been in existence for four years. Cash and medical supplies raised have exceeded one million US dollars in value. The United China Relief (composed of seven organizations including the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, the China Emergency Relief Committee, the China Aid Council, the Committee for Relief of Chinese War Orphans, the Christian China Relief Committee, the Committee for the Promotion of Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, and the United Board for Christian Colleges in China) plans to donate five million yuan to the Aid to China Fund this year, with the Bureau undertaking 1.6 million yuan. Since its implementation, American oil magnate Rockefeller has donated US$50,000 in one instance, and a celebrity in Pennsylvania has also donated US$20,000. The total amount of donations received throughout the United States has now exceeded one million US dollars.

Health Clinics Established Successively in China

According to an announcement by the United China Relief, Ms. Chen, secretary to Madame Chiang Kai-shek, wrote to the Medical Aid to China Bureau, an important component of the Relief organization, stating that of the 150 health clinics currently funded by the Bureau, five, including Fuzichi and the northern bank of the Jialing River, have been completed. Madame Chiang Kai-shek personally visited and inspected the "Fuzichi" health clinic, the first to be completed near the New Life Movement headquarters in Chongqing, and photographed its interior and equipment for the Bureau. It is reported that "each of these health clinics, funded by the Medical Aid to China Bureau, employs 18 staff members, with monthly expenses of 3,560 Chinese currency. The equipment is complete, with pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and other rooms, and provides free medical treatment. Specialists are in charge of internal and external medicine, with particular attention paid to midwifery, vaccination, physical examinations for schoolchildren, and public health education.

US President Thanks Chinese Youth in Letter

It has also been learned that President Roosevelt recently sent a letter to Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, expressing his deep gratitude for the letter of thanks from 100,000 Chinese youth presented to him last month, expressing their gratitude for US aid to China. President Roosevelt said, "These young people are well aware of the problems faced by all nations that uphold international pacifism with justice. I am greatly excited by this. Your patriotic spirit deeply moves me. I am convinced that these young people, whether in times of peace or in the face of hardship and difficulty, will always cherish and uphold the torch of their ideals." President Roosevelt asked the Ambassador to convey this message to the youth, expressing his sincere gratitude for their thoughtful letter and signatures.

Organizing the Sino-British Development Association

London News - British Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Industrial Cooperatives Association, Barnes, announced at a well-attended Aid to China meeting that a Sino-British Development Association is being organized to assist the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives movement. This Sino-British Development Association has a strong Sino-British committee with various commercial and technical advisors, as well as representatives of shareholders. Barnes emphasized that this new association is a commercial enterprise, and every pound spent must earn one pound in return. The association's trade has been guaranteed by the Chinese government, and the current trade is mainly to purchase machinery for the "Industrial Cooperatives" or to provide loans to members. The association hopes to promote the import of Chinese goods into Britain. "Although the beginnings of this are small, I believe we have initiated some work that will affect workers worldwide, increasing economic reciprocity as the most solid foundation for peace."

### The Coolidge Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow

The President Coolidge, the largest passenger ship of the American President Lines, which was requisitioned by the US Maritime Commission, has been out of service in the Far East for two months. After being requisitioned, the ship was docked in San Francisco awaiting reassignment. It is now learned that the ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today from Little Luzon via Hong Kong and return to San Francisco and Los Angeles on the 14th. However, due to encountering a hurricane en route, it will be delayed until tomorrow. Because the company maintains strict secrecy about the itinerary and ship names, the company claims that the exact time of arrival in Shanghai has not yet been telegraphed. The reason why the President Coolidge is resuming service to Shanghai is that it has a large deadweight tonnage, sufficient to accommodate a large amount of cargo. However, the right to command the voyage still belongs to the US Maritime Commission. This time, it is also carrying a large quantity of American wheat to Shanghai for disaster relief.

Bowen's Trip to the US May Have a Mission

Major Bowen, Chief of the Police of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, has applied for seven months' leave to visit his home in Canada. It is now confirmed that his application has been approved, and he was originally scheduled to travel to the US and return to Canada on the Nitta Maru on July 31. However, the trip has been postponed. It is reported that Bowen is expected to travel to the US on the returning President Coolidge from Hong Kong within days, stay briefly in the US, and then visit his home in Canada. His daughter will accompany him. However, Bowen's sudden application for leave to go to the US at a time when Shanghai's security is serious has aroused concern from all sectors. There are rumors that he has an important mission, which remains to be proven.

### The Seizure of Mobil Oil Tanker Has Been Submitted for Negotiation

After the Mobil Oil Company's oil tanker Mei Yao, carrying 1,600 tins of gasoline, was forcibly confiscated by the Japanese on the pretext of supplying guerrillas, the company negotiated with the Customs. The US Consulate General in Shanghai has also reported the matter and is negotiating with the Japanese for its return. The gasoline was all supplied by the company for commercial use, so there is absolutely no reason for the Japanese to detain it.

### Over One Hundred People Infected with True Cholera

Since the beginning of summer, epidemics have been rampant. According to statistics, as of now, there are a total of 148 cases of true cholera, of which 11 have died. 80 cases are in the International Settlement, 40 in the French Concession, and the remaining 28 in Hongkou, Nanshi, Zhabei, and other districts. The number of cholera cases in the Hongkou area is particularly high this year compared to previous years. It is reported that in addition to requiring people entering and leaving the area to be vaccinated, the Japanese are now implementing compulsory vaccination for all Chinese employed by Japanese. At the same time, all suspected infectious diseases will be investigated and diagnosed.

### The Tji Baro Departed Yesterday; Dutch Nationals Evacuate by Ship

Java Mail Vessels Have Not Received Suspension Orders; The Tjisadane Has Telegraphed to Cancel Service

The Dutch Java Mail Company's Tji Baro was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 5th of this month, but due to the need to transport a large number of passengers and cargo to various ports in Southeast Asia, and later due to a hurricane, it was delayed. The ship finally departed yesterday at 12:00 noon, heading for the Dutch East Indies via Xiamen and Hong Kong. It is carrying over 200 passengers, mostly Dutch nationals from Shanghai heading to the Dutch East Indies and on to Australia. At a time when the situation in the Dutch East Indies is tense, the Dutch Consulate General in Shanghai has issued a notice to register Dutch nationals, so all parties are paying attention to the evacuation of the Dutch. Regarding the Java Company's mail ships preparing to suspend service, although the company has not yet received formal orders, the company's Tjisadane has telegraphed to cancel its service to Shanghai. Whether the Tji Baro will still need to come to Shanghai after sailing to Southeast Asia cannot be confirmed by the company.

### Increased Security in Both Settlements; Curfew Thoroughly Enforced

Troops from Various Countries and Merchant Corps Deployed Yesterday; Unusually Strict Searches in the Western District

Since the authorities in both settlements began special security measures the day before yesterday, yesterday was the second day, and the precautionary measures were even stricter. The curfew was originally from 12:30 am to 6:00 am the next morning. However, normally, traffic was allowed around 4:00 am, effectively shortening the curfew. Now that special security measures are in place, pedestrians were not allowed to pass through both settlements after 4:00 am yesterday morning until after 5:00 am when they were allowed to move freely.

Troop Alert

In addition to preventing various gatherings and blockading some traffic, both settlements deployed all patrol teams, plainclothes teams, and car patrol teams to patrol and check pedestrians and vehicles along the way. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps on the International Settlement side also assisted in maintaining order. US troops guarded the area west of Yu Qiaqing Road and south of Robison Road, Italian troops protected the northern part of Robison Road and the extraterritorial road area. The British troops in the area east of Yu Qiaqing Road and west of the Bund were entirely responsible for security by the British members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.

Western District Defense

The authorities of the International Settlement, considering that the anniversary of the Shanghai War is approaching and fearing that criminals would cause trouble and disrupt public order, have increased security in the extraterritorial area. Yesterday, a reporter from the Da Guang News Agency personally inspected various places, such as Great Western Road, Hardoon Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Connaught Road, where barbed wire was placed, leaving only access for pedestrians. Seven or eight detectives, assisted by Italian soldiers, stood on both sides, strictly searching pedestrians and vehicles.

### Another Hurricane Approaching Shanghai Rapidly

Huangpu River Experiences Another High Tide; Humidity Begins to Decrease Yesterday

According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory, after the hurricane swept through the city and entered the Yellow Sea, it had generally approached Weihaiwei. Because the Japanese have stopped reporting meteorological information in North China, its exact coordinates are unknown. Another hurricane, which originated in the South Pacific, reached 26 degrees north latitude and 121.5 degrees east longitude at 2:00 pm yesterday, moving rapidly north. The city is again threatened.

Tidal Inundation

Also, at 3:00 pm yesterday, the high tide in the Huangpu River recurred. According to the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau's prediction, the height was only 10 feet and 8 inches, but the actual height exceeded the prediction by more than a foot. The tide flooded the roads again from the sewers, especially at the corner of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, where the water accumulated more severely. Also, the water on the roads in western Shanghai yesterday had not yet receded. There is still a high tide today, and the roads will inevitably be flooded again.

House Collapse Causes Death

The North China Daily News reported that, according to information received yesterday, the hurricane caused considerable damage to houses in the International Settlement and western Shanghai. Countless trees were also blown down by the wind, and three people were killed and twelve injured. The ambulance service received twelve telephone calls and twelve reports of accidents and rushed to rescue the injured in the International Settlement. Three of the dead were women, one of whom was seriously injured when a house collapsed on Jiaxing Road, and the other died at 458 Ningguo Road. Another male died at 4:01 pm yesterday at Yejia浜 on Connaught Road when a house collapsed. At the time, one person was also injured. At 9:37 am yesterday, part of the house at 258 Tangshan Road suddenly collapsed, but fortunately no one was injured.

Humidity Record

Due to the wind and rain in the city yesterday, the air humidity increased. According to the Observatory records, it reached 100% on the 8th, and 94% to 100% on the 9th. Yesterday, it began to decrease to below 90%. The density of air humidity has exceeded the records of recent months, so attention should be paid to the mold and rot of goods stored in warehouses and stacking yards. Residents should also pay attention to health care.

### China-America Radio Station Broadcasting as Usual

The XMHA radio station (China-America Radio Station) of the China-America Radio Wireless Corporation in the city is known for its accurate news reports. The reports of Mr. Alcott in particular have won the trust of the general public in the city. Recently, due to the hurricane damage to the station's antenna, it is being repaired by craftsmen and will be temporarily suspended for a few days. However, recently, rumors have spread that the China-America Radio Station has been closed and will withdraw and no longer operate. According to the station's manager, Johnson, the rumor of withdrawal is completely untrue. We have no intention of abandoning the operation of the China-America Radio Station.

### Shanghai in the Past Four Years: Development Under Abnormal Conditions

The Main Reason is Control by the Japanese; Ordinary People Suffer the Pain of Not Being Able to Survive

Economic expert Arles wrote an article in the English-language Greater Shanghai Weekly yesterday, reviewing Shanghai in the past four years, saying that Shanghai's commerce has developed under abnormal conditions for several months since the outbreak of the war. After four years, the abnormal situation is becoming more and more serious. It is almost impossible to incorporate it into the normal situation in the shortest possible time. The isolation of transportation in the past four years has made it more difficult for Shanghai to trade with the mainland than with foreign countries. Since some places were occupied by the Japanese, the boundaries are strict and there are many obstacles. In addition, in the past year, the Japanese have implemented strict control over import and export commodities, and import and export trade has almost lost its freedom. However, post-war Shanghai is still a paradise. However, due to the large population, public health problems have arisen, and the crime rate has also increased. In the past, Shanghai could obtain large quantities of cheap rice, cotton, and coal from the mainland. After the war, it had to purchase them from abroad. Therefore, the amount of wartime profits of industry and commerce is staggering, but the general public cannot survive.

### The Two Students Interviewed Share Pitiful Backgrounds

Unlimited Hidden Pain While Tears Flow; Mother Abandoned by Father and Endures Miserable Years

(1) Unfeeling Brother

"Boiling beans to burn beanstalks, beans weep in the pot;

Born of the same root, why so eager to harm each other?"

This is Cao Zijian's poem lamenting his predicament. Yesterday, I met one of the more than twenty applicants for financial aid. He shed tears and explained the reasons for his application, which could not but make me revisit this poem. At the same time, I couldn't control my boundless feelings of sympathy, but I couldn't help but place some hope in his brother's courage to change.

The father of this student applying for financial aid is old and unable to produce. He lives with his brother and sister-in-law. His brother's monthly income reaches more than 300 yuan. This monthly salary should not require him to apply for financial aid for his younger brother. His family has more than a dozen people. To be fair, in this tide of rising prices, with the burden of tuition fees for five or six children, his brother may not be able to cope with it easily, but he is certainly not in dire straits. Since he applied for financial aid, our assumption is that the student may have a hidden pain. The result of the conversation was unfortunately as expected. Originally, his elder brother, because of the heavy burden, put his younger brother first, and there was no way to pay his tuition fees. He only shed tears, and he never wanted to reveal the fact that his elder brother refused to pay the fees, but the fact still cannot be buried. I think similar facts are inevitable in all kinds of societies. We sympathize with the student's experience in seeking education, we expect his brother to sincerely reflect on himself, and we are willing to do our best for the student to ensure that his studies are not hindered.

(2) Unrighteous Father

"Only see the new person smile, never hear the old person cry."

She is a female student. Her father teaches in a certain place, but he disregards the lives of his wife and daughter, and has long been in love with someone else, allowing his weak wife and young daughter to be forced to come to Shanghai. Fortunately, his wife had received considerable education in her early years and found a teaching position in a primary school, maintaining the lives of her mother and daughter with a monthly salary of 40 to 50 yuan. For the sake of her daughter's future, she came to apply for financial aid. These past facts should be extremely painful for her mother and daughter! But her father, as an intellectual, is willing to abandon his wife and daughter. If he can sincerely condemn himself, he must feel deeply guilty. At the same time, we cannot help but feel ashamed of his role as a teacher of morality, but we still hope that the mistakes of gentlemen are like the eclipse of the sun and moon. If he can correct his mistakes, we will of course still look up to him.

After we have met with many young students, these impressions of unfortunate events in society cannot but emerge in our minds. We always feel that we hope to no longer hear these miserable voices, so as not to hurt the hearts of those young students. If we can save these students who are suffering and restore the happiness of their families, that would be "leaning on tiptoe and watching for it"! (N)

### The V for Victory Movement Has Spread to Shanghai

In Addition to the V for Victory Movement, the "Happiness Chain" is Also Popular

Since British Prime Minister Churchill actively promoted the V for Victory movement, it has now expanded into a common victory symbol for democratic group countries. The Chinese communities in the city are now enthusiastically responding. This V is always visible on the main streets, occasionally with the Chinese characters "Resist and Build" or "Democratic Group". Yesterday, a foreign national in the city said that he admired the courage and enthusiasm of the Chinese youth and believed that the relationship between the ABCD group would become closer in the future. At the same time, the "Happiness Chain" has recently become popular, requiring recipients to rewrite nine copies and distribute them to friends. It is reported that this "Happiness Chain" is written in English and was initiated by Tagore Free People. It has spread to Shanghai via the Philippines and Hong Kong.

Wall Letters Found on Important Roads

Since the day before yesterday, huge red and black wall letters have been found on the main roads of the city, such as Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Avenue Edward VII, Rue Say-Zoong, and the French Concession. In addition to the "V" character, there are also words such as "Victory in War", "Nation-Building Will Succeed", and "Final Victory", as well as the English letters "V ABCD", which are conspicuous and eye-catching. Passers-by stop to watch and are deeply excited.

### Cooked Water Shops Request Reduced Water Fees

Coal and Water Prices Have Increased Repeatedly Since the War; Maintaining the Original Selling Price is Difficult

Since the price of white coal and tap water has been repeatedly increased, the more than 500 cooked water shops in the city have suffered a serious blow. Cooked water is mostly supplied to the common people. In order to reduce the burden on the common people and to jointly suppress and stabilize prices, the Cooked Water Shop Association has strictly ordered that the selling price of cooked water must not be secretly increased. Fortunately, the cooked water shops in the city have been able to share this purpose and abide by the regulations. Now, because the tap water company has increased the tap water surcharge since July, the expenses of the cooked water shops have become more and more extensive, and it is becoming more and more difficult to maintain.

Request for Preferential Treatment

It is reported that the owners of more than 500 cooked water shops in the city have been calling on the industry association, requesting that it negotiate with the tap water companies in the two settlements to provide tap water with preferential treatment in order to take care of the livelihood of the common people and to jointly assist the authorities in thoroughly suppressing and stabilizing prices, or to change the calculation method, or to exempt the surcharge in order to reduce costs and maintain the original price for the sale of cooked water. The committee members of the Cooked Water Shop Association, in view of the fact that the statements made by the members are true, are now secretly studying and discussing them.

Social Problems

According to the standing committee members of the association, Ji Jianming, Zhang Delong, and Ye Hanjun, speaking to a reporter from New Sound News Agency, the industry has closed down due to the difficulty of maintaining it due to the high price of coal and water after the war, which has led to four major social problems: (1) Due to the closure of cooked water shops, citizens must boil their own water. At a time when the population of the isolated island is dense and the houses are like pigeon cages, it is easy to cause fires. (2) The number of people who suffocate due to coal gas due to coal stoves burning day and night will increase. (3) The working class will inevitably drink more raw water, which is prone to disease and is related to hygiene. (4) Nearly 10,000 people in the city rely on cooked water shops for their livelihoods, and they will suffer unemployment due to the closure of the cooked water shops. Therefore, the above points cannot be ignored.

### Prisoner Commits Assault in Ward Road Prison

Zhu Si, from Anhui, was sentenced to six years in prison for robbery and is serving his sentence in Ward Road Prison. According to prison rules, prisoners serving long sentences must do work, so he was assigned to the paper cutting department. At around 7:00 am on the 8th, prisoner Zhu and Liu Wenwu, from Shandong, who was sentenced to five years for abduction, had a quarrel over a trivial matter. Liu was assigned to manage the area near the department. He suspected that Zhu had told the Yindu on 63 Lane 3 Head about his bad words. Zhu then took a paper cutting knife and went to Liu to question him. When they disagreed, he stabbed Liu hard in the right abdomen with the knife. He fell to the ground in pain and called for help. Yindu No. 17 saw this and immediately caught Zhu, took the knife, and reported to the Western Warden. He telephoned the Huishan Police Station, and Chinese Detective Zhang Yunsheng came and took the prisoner Zhu to the police station. He hired a car to send the injured to the police hospital for treatment. Yesterday, he escorted the prisoner Zhu to a special court. The police lawyer detailed the case, saying that Liu's injuries were serious, and that several inches of his intestines had flowed out in the hospital, and that his life might be in danger. According to the testimony of Yindu No. 17, Zhu's confession was vague. Judge Huang ruled that he should be remanded in custody and re-examined at a later date.

### Airmail to Malaya Temporarily Suspended

Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1686 yesterday stated, "The air route of the Dutch East Indies Airways from Saigon via Singapore to Batavia has been suspended. This Bureau has temporarily suspended the acceptance of all airmail sent from this route to Malaya, Dutch East Indies, and Australia. It is urgently announced.

### The French Authorities are Determined to Strictly Enforce the Control of Rising Prices in Times of Turbulence

Combining Dredging Sources and Cracking Down on Hoarding

The person in charge of the French Concession Evaluation Committee said that the Committee will implement the established procedures to the fullest extent. However, all members of the Committee are doing their best, and they hope that the leaders of all industries in the city and insightful people will assist them in order to achieve great results.

Combining Symptoms and Root Causes

As for the measures to be taken to suppress and stabilize prices, the Committee has repeatedly discussed and agreed that the rise in prices is due to the manipulation and monopoly of bulk goods. If these people have ulterior motives and repeatedly wait for slight changes in the international situation, they will be active in the market, hoarding goods and raising prices for profit. Therefore, the only good policy to suppress and stabilize prices is to take effective measures that combine the symptoms and root causes. On the one hand, we must assist merchants in dredging the sources of goods, whether finished products or semi-finished products, in order to increase the number of spot goods in the market.

Cracking Down on Evil Practices

On the other hand, the evil practice of hoarding goods and raising prices must be thoroughly cracked down on. If we allow it to continue in the long run, the sources of domestic and foreign goods and raw materials will pour in, but the number of spot goods in the market of various industries will be difficult to increase. If the spot goods in the market are not abundant, people's hearts will inevitably be tight, and the selling prices of various items will continue to rise. Although the two authorities have issued repeated orders for this, these people still comply in appearance but oppose in their hearts and turn a blind eye. Therefore, the Committee will strictly crack down on the evil practice of hoarding and speculation.

### Undertaking Overall Planning

According to the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, since February of this year, after the source of Indian coal was cut off, Shanghai has faced problems such as coal shortages and reductions. Later, the Shanghai Power Company and other foreign merchants planned to charter ships to purchase coal from coal-producing areas, but this also failed. Subsequently, the Public Works Department negotiated with the Japanese side to solve this problem. Unexpectedly, just as this matter was underway, the United States and Britain froze Japanese assets, making it impossible to resolve this issue. Since assets have been frozen, it is impossible to purchase foreign coal, and this has a significant impact. Therefore, the Shanghai concession authorities are making an overall plan for the coal issue in order to find a solution. The Shanghai Power Company had an estimated reserve of 200,000 tons of coal last summer. When the source of Indian coal was cut off this year, it still had about 150,000 tons of coal. The monthly consumption is estimated at 50,000 tons, which can only last for three months. Later, the company tried to purchase some Indian coal and also shipped heavy oil (fuel oil) from the United States, so it has been maintained until now, with a reserve of about 100,000 tons of coal. Since the freeze order, Shanghai's industrial sector will inevitably reduce working hours due to this impact, and the demand for electricity will also decrease, so a major power outage crisis will not occur in the short term.

### Clear and Refreshing Weather; Intensified Assistance and Study Visits

Jingzhi Girls' Middle School Donates Free School Places

Elementary School Students Should Use Slates and Slate Pencils

As of last night, the total amount of the newspaper's reader scholarship fund has exceeded the 40,000 yuan mark, which is gratifying since yesterday was a holiday and donations from all parties continued to pour in. The hurricane has passed, and the weather is cool and refreshing. The work of family visits for applicants and face-to-face interviews at the newspaper office was even more intense yesterday. This procedure has been completed by sixty to seventy percent and can be completed according to the scheduled plan. Then the review will begin, which can also be gratifying to the enthusiastic donors.

Jingzhi Girls' Middle School Sets Up Free Places

Jingzhi Girls' Primary and Secondary School on Chengdu Road and Foch Road is very supportive of the newspaper's scholarship program and has specifically set up twelve free places for the newspaper, namely two places each for grades five and six of primary school, two places for first grade of junior high school, one place each for second and third grade of junior high school, and one place each for first and second grade of senior high school. If students have excellent academic performance after enrollment, they may be rewarded separately in the second year. The school's kindness is deeply appreciated. The newspaper has specified the following methods: (1) Any female student who believes that her academic ability is adequate can write a letter stating her detailed academic qualifications and family situation without filling out an application form. (2) The school is scheduled to start classes on September 8. All applicants should send a letter before the 15th of this month. (3) Those who are qualified will be invited to the newspaper office for an interview. Those who are not qualified will not be replied to.

Cherish Material Resources and Reduce Burdens

A letter from Mr. Wang Huifang says, "Your newspaper's initiation of the reader scholarship fund demonstrates the spirit of mutual assistance for the country, society, and humanity, which is admirable. I am sending one hundred yuan and soliciting one hundred yuan on behalf of Mr. Bai Ruixi. Please accept them. I have a humble opinion and wonder if it can be published. Elementary school students used to practice writing and arithmetic using slates and slate pencils, which was extremely economical. Now, they use paper notebooks, even foreign paper notebooks, which are expensive and consume a lot. The cost for one person is limited, but if we add up hundreds of thousands of elementary school students in Shanghai, the number is considerable. In my opinion, it is unavoidable for middle school and university students to use foreign paper notebooks, but elementary school students can save a lot. These are the words of an amateur. I wonder what educational experts think?" Mr. Wang's suggestion is worth studying, and it is published above.

Donations Exceed 500 Yuan Yesterday

Donations from all parties yesterday included 100 yuan from Mr. Wang Huifang, 100 yuan from Mr. Bai Ruixi, 50 yuan from Mr. Gao Weike, 200 yuan solicited by photographer Kang Zuyi (including 50 yuan from Erquan Shanren, 50 yuan from Jinlong Gauze Company, 60 yuan from Kang Zuyi, 10 yuan from Jiang Chuibing, 10 yuan from Hui Ying, 5 yuan each from Yan Bin, Zhou Yushu, Ye Jun, and Bu Changji), 30 yuan from Mr. Yang Yusheng, 17.30 yuan found by apprentice Wang Zengming from Shen Gui Ji Hardware Store on Beijing Road, 11 yuan found by apprentice Zou Xinshan from the same store, 5 yuan from Chen Shunde, 10 yuan from Yang Ji, 9 yuan from the 1941 class of Xiaoshi Middle School, 5 yuan from Rong Zhixuan, 5 yuan from Dr. Qu Liheng, 2 yuan from Xiangjun (abstaining from cigarettes for two days), and 2 yuan from Zhu Youdi. The total amount is 556.30 yuan. The previous balance was 39,834.39 yuan. The total is 40,390.69 yuan.

### The Reason for Tedder Pang's Arrest

Embezzlement of 2,000 Yuan in Public Funds; Unable to Post Bail, Thus Arrested Quickly

In addition to being suspected of selling military supplies, the reason for the arrest of Tedder Pang, acting executive officer of the U.S. Consular Court in China, was that he had embezzled 2,000 yuan in public funds, which was confirmed by prosecutor Sears of the agency. He was dismissed and arrested on the 8th. His vacancy was temporarily filled by Mrs. Ginggen, the secretary appointed by Mr. Sears. Mrs. Ginggen executed the arrest warrant ten minutes after being sworn into office. After Tedder Pang was arrested, the agency allowed him to post bail of 5,000 yuan, but because he did not have this amount of money, he had to be detained in the Ward Road prison. Although there is no definite date for the trial, the case has caused quite a stir among the American community. Tedder Pang previously arrested the "Slot Machine King" and brought him to justice for trial. Now, he himself is imprisoned. Tedder was originally a Shanghai correspondent for an American newspaper. Not long after arriving in Shanghai, he became a news broadcaster for the Greater America Radio Station. He was later dismissed for broadcasting beyond the scope. Later, he replaced Mr. Bertelsen as acting executive officer. One of his feet is slightly lame because he was shot in the leg while fighting with bandits when he served in the Chicago Police Department. Mr. Deng, the American judge in China, has refused to comment on the development of the case. The American community hopes that Mr. Haermick, the U.S. Consular Judge in China, can come to China from the United States as soon as possible to handle the case personally.

### Old Woman's Hair Dye Suddenly Swells; Barber Shop Owner Summoned for Interrogation

At about 6:00 p.m. yesterday, an old woman, 57 years old, went to the Songyuan Barber Shop at the intersection of Caishi Street and Father Du Road in the French Concession to dye her hair. The barber dyed all the white hair on her head black. Unexpectedly, the woman's head suddenly swelled and she became delirious not long after leaving the shop. She was sent to the hospital by someone, and her family reported it to the police, who dispatched officers to investigate and took the shop owner to the station for questioning.

### Street Cleaner Picks Up Hand Grenade; Hitting It Causes Disaster

Left Hand Blown Off

At around 9:00 a.m. yesterday, a street cleaner named Chu Guanghong, 23 years old, from Yancheng, picked up a hand grenade at the gate of 103 Haifang Road in the Public Concession. Not knowing what it was, he hit it with a stone. Unexpectedly, the grenade exploded immediately with a loud bang. Fragments of the grenade flew in all directions, and Chu's left hand was blown off. Bleeding profusely, he fell unconscious. The nearby guards rushed to the scene after hearing the news and urgently called an ambulance to take him to the Tongren Second Hospital for treatment.

### Two Notorious Robbers Sentenced

Notorious robbers Dong Rongqing and Huang Lianxi from Jiangbei, for carrying weapons and gathering gangs to rob the Wang family at 11 Haining Road, Tong Yutang at 149 Carter Road, Yao Fuxiang at 4023 Robison Road, Shunfeng at 691 Robison Road, Liu Guanghui at 15 Muirhead Road, and for shooting and wounding Chen Zhangsong, a clerk at the Shunfeng Tobacco and Paper Store, each committing a capital crime, were investigated and arrested by Chinese Detective Shang Wu and Detective Kong Guangxiao of the Putuo Road Police Station. A pistol, five bullets, and a hand grenade were seized and taken to the police station and sent to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baokang filed a public prosecution for robbery and attempted murder under the Criminal Law, requesting strict punishment. The case was investigated by Judge Huang Risheng, who found the facts clear and ordered them to be remanded in custody pending sentencing. Yesterday, Judge Huang delivered the judgment in the Third Criminal Court, sentencing Dong Rongqing to nine years and six months of imprisonment and Huang Yunxi to six years of imprisonment. The guns, bullets, and hand grenade were confiscated and stored in the police station for destruction.

### Three Teachings Morality Association Continues to Relieve Disaster Areas

In view of the continuous deaths of refugees in the Nanshi refugee area, various charitable organizations in the city have specially organized emergency relief. In addition to cooking porridge and distributing meal tickets, the Shanghai Three Teachings Morality Charity Council also accepts donations of food and other items from all walks of life and distributes them on behalf of the donors. The work is still ongoing. The association's office is located at No. 10 Hongyun Villa, Lane 70, Jing'an Temple Road, telephone 91067.

### Actual Visit Records of Scholarship Applicants (5)

Their former status was quite high, and their income was also quite good. Now, they still hold meager salaries and have to maintain this high standard of living. Due to their status and face, they are embarrassed to ask others for help. It is spicy in their mouths, bitter in their hearts. In this vast city, how many people of this class are there?

The old lawyer who rents a room upstairs in a Chinese medicine store in the western district of the French Concession is one such person. He now earns less than 200 yuan a month, maintaining a family of six, and is also responsible for the tuition fees of two daughters. Generally speaking, it does not seem very difficult. However, he is a poor scholar. Although he has a very long history in the judicial field, his hair is now gray, and the result is that his sleeves are empty. His eldest daughter has gone to apply for the Shu Ping Scholarship, and his second daughter has applied to this newspaper. Listening to his calm and slightly sighing tone, I can't help but feel infinite sympathy. (T)

Tragic Experiences

Yuan Xingzun is an eighteen-year-old young man from Wujin, Jiangsu. He wrote his brief history on the application form: "Graduated from Lufei Lane Primary School in Nanjing, entered the Second Municipal Middle School. The August 13th incident occurred, and he dropped out of school for a year. He came to Shanghai to take refuge. He completed junior high school at Southern Middle School. Due to a serious illness, he was idle for half a year. After recovering, he transferred to Huiling Middle School, first year of senior high school." He also wrote next to the form: "The family situation is extremely miserable. Please allow me to present it in person." His academic performance has not been affected by his experiences, and he has also received four certificates of merit. His conduct is also rated as "A."

Because his family members are not in Shanghai, and he is the only one living in the school dormitory, we invited him to the office for a face-to-face interview. He arrived on time, carrying a book. An old blue cloth gown reflected his thin face, making him look even more haggard. He said: "My father used to work in the archives department of the Ministry of Finance, responsible for keeping files. After the August 13th incident, he was transferred to Hankou. At this time, my mother unfortunately passed away in Nanjing. My two younger sisters and I followed my grandfather and maternal great-aunt to Changzhou. Unfortunately, our ancestral home was bombed, and we had nowhere to live. We then went to the countryside, relying on relatives and friends for support. We only came to Shanghai in the 28th year. We didn't know that my grandfather passed away this year, and the family situation deteriorated. My maternal great-aunt also passed away soon after. By the time the funeral was over, we were already heavily in debt. Due to the heavy blows, I suffered a serious illness last year, and my two younger sisters dropped out of school." Speaking of this, he couldn't help but shed tears. After a while, he pressed his book with his hand and continued: "Because my father's income is not enough to subsidize the family, my two younger sisters have to live in relatives' homes. My food and lodging depend on borrowing and pawning, but there are not many places where I can borrow money and many things that I can pawn!" His voice gradually lowered. After thinking for a while, he said, "The cost of my grandfather's temporary coffin has been owed for two years. I don't know what to do with my mother's coffin?" He turned his tone to himself with great sadness and sighed for his future: "What if I graduate from middle school?" The reporter sympathized with him, comforted him, and encouraged him: "A young man should not be so depressed, but should cheer up!" He became excited, "If I can get the Shenbao scholarship to continue my studies, my happiness will surpass everything, and I will never forget it!" He said goodbye to me with eager expectations. (D)

### How to Study Botany (3)

— Yuan Shanzheng

(4) Classification Research: The classification of plants is an important task in the study of botany. After studying plant morphology, we can begin to study taxonomy. The method of research is to collect various fully developed plants, use a key, and compare them with specimens, proceeding step by step without error. Then, we can determine the family and genus of the plant. As for the characteristics of each category, they are summarized by scientists from the morphological properties of many plants. Except for extremely important categories, it is not necessary to memorize them strongly.

(5) Precise Records: After carefully observing the morphology and growth of a plant and determining its category, we record it in writing or drawing for future reference. 1. For written records, it is best to create a table, dividing it into sections for roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds, filling in the information accurately in order. 2. Drawing method: A. First, carefully observe the plant clearly, then lightly divide it into several areas with a pencil according to the plant's structure, drawing step by step from left to right or from top to bottom of the paper. Once it is accurately depicted, deepen the pencil lines. B. Draw on one side of the paper, arranging the drawings evenly. C. Divide the drawings into three types: one is a realistic drawing, two is a schematic drawing, and three is a detailed drawing. D. The lines drawn must be smooth and continuous, and corners and circumferences must also be connected and closely joined. E. Indicate the type of drawing below the drawing, and label each part of the drawing. The lines used for labeling should be straight and should never intersect.

(6) Making Specimens: Because written or drawn records are sometimes not as accurate as the real thing, after collecting specimens, we take all or a part of them and make them into specimens for research and to aid memory. The most common method is pressing specimens. Other types include various leaf specimens, fruit specimens, and root specimens, for the purpose of studying morphology.

(7) Reading Outline: For beginners, the most troublesome thing about botany is that it is not easy to memorize. If we use the above methods to study diligently, it will be easy to remember. Reference books and textbooks are also tools for studying. After reading and understanding them, we extract the key points and create a table, so that the organization is clear and easy to understand at a glance. This makes it easier to remember and saves time and energy in reviewing.

### Ways to Beat the Heat

— Bai Zheng

In recent days, the fiery sun has been blazing, the asphalt roads are soft and melting, and the roadside trees are lush and green. The loud chirping of cicadas and the calls of ice and melon vendors weave together a picture of high summer. Wave after wave of heat assaults everyone on this isolated island, and the cry of "Hot! Hot!" echoes in everyone's mouth. Indeed, the mercury in the thermometer has approached the hundred-degree mark, and the soaring prices on the isolated island have also reached boiling point, seemingly echoing the climate of these past few days. Therefore, the people living on this isolated island, under the oppression of these dual forces, are truly suffocating, as if they have fallen into the depths of fiery hell. But life must go on! Thus, "beating the heat" has imperceptibly become the newest phrase. In this fiery hot place, how can one comfortably while away the long summer? But methods of beating the heat vary. Before the war, one could go to Lushan, Qingdao, or Moganshan to escape the heat. Now, with every step fraught with difficulty, one can only shrink onto this isolated island to spend this long summer. There are two ways to beat the heat:

(1) Material Ways to Beat the Heat: Watermelon, frozen desserts, soda, shaved ice, orange juice, etc., have become wonderful products for beating the heat. Watermelon can quench thirst and promote urination. It is a natural domestic cold food and has always been the most popular in summer. However, before the war, watermelon was for everyone. Now, watermelon prices are too expensive, and only the wealthy class can enjoy it to the fullest. Frozen desserts and orange juice, which cool one to the core, are also excellent ways to beat the heat. Their flavors are completely different from watermelon, and each has its own merits. Nowadays, popsicles have replaced watermelon and become a popular cold drink. They are cold and sweet, but unfortunately, they are not as nutritious as watermelon and frozen desserts. Swimming is a very good summer sport, but now one cannot go to the seaside and can only squeeze into those small artificial swimming pools. But it does have some benefits for physical health. Some people have nothing to do at night and go to air-conditioned dance halls to sit for a while, which is also a special way to beat the heat.

(2) Spiritual Ways to Beat the Heat: Summer is hot, and one has no heart to do anything. It is best to have a book in hand and read various novels and miscellaneous books that one loves, or various magazines such as "Xifeng," "Wanhxiang," "Xiaoshuo Yuebao," "Le Guan," and "Yongan," lying on a cool mat to while away half a day. Adding some spiritual food and turning on the radio to listen to music and songs will naturally calm one's mind and make one feel cooler, and one will not feel the heat. If one has nothing to do and is idle all day, one will feel restless and feverish, and one will feel the heat even more oppressive. Some people seek improper entertainment to stimulate the spirit, which eventually makes them depressed. This is not the right way to beat the heat, so you must choose the right way to beat the heat.

### A Casual Discussion on Beating the Heat

— Yaming

Talking about beating the heat in Shanghai, this metropolis, first requires careful consideration, because in the city, unlike in a summer resort, there are all kinds of environmental limitations.

However, I think that if we can use our brains a little, beating the heat will not become a problem. I think the greatest purpose of beating the heat is to spend the summer under hygienic and healthy conditions. Then, one must ask you, do you prefer to use dynamic methods or static methods?

If you prefer to use dynamic methods, then although you cannot take a boat to your summer resort, you can take a double-decker bus for a ride around the city. Although you cannot climb Mogan Mountain, you can walk to the top of a nine-story building for a panoramic view. Although you cannot stroll on the beach, you can wander under the shade of lush greenery, which can all make your body and mind comfortable. Moreover, there are so many places to go.

Even at home, you can prepare various summer drinks and do housework that you have never done before, so you can get new interest.

If you prefer static methods, then you can listen to your favorite programs on the radio, pick out a few books written by your favorite authors and read them. You can collect and browse landscape pictures from all over the world. The snow-capped mountains of Switzerland and the snow scenes of the Alps are like a refreshing medicine that can make you feel cool all over. The scenic spots of various countries can bring your thoughts to those places worth staying in.

Alternatively, you can study chess, Go, Xiangqi (Chinese chess), and the chess pieces popular in Europe and America. Or, engage in stamp collecting, or create some handicrafts, or engage in drawing. Any method that can make you use your brain can make your body calm, which meets your needs and avoids the heat. Experts in recreation say that if you have proper recreation, you can be happy. Be Happy with A. Hobby. In fact, these recreations are still excellent ways to beat the heat.

### Hong Kong's "Snow"

— San San

Hong Kong never snows all year round.

In the summer, when you walk on the streets of Hong Kong, you can also see some shops with a large (usually red) box with a large white character "雪" (snow) written on it. You should know that what is stored inside is not "compressed snow blocks" of dry ice (solid carbon dioxide), but transparent, very hard, meltable -- actually "artificial ice"! This kind of "snow" is transported daily from the "ice factory" to the above-mentioned distribution points, sawed open, and sold to chefs and peddlers who run cold drink stalls.

If you point to it and say to the Cantonese, "This is ice, not snow," they will definitely argue with you and insist that "係雪" ("係" means "is" in Cantonese, pronounced 　　). Therefore, Cantonese people who grow up in Hong Kong do not know snow. In general, elementary school students only stare wide-eyed when they see drawings of hexagonal snowflakes under a magnifying glass in textbooks. If they encounter a teacher with less experience, they will also talk nonsense for a while...

I remember that Hong Kong had a heavy snowfall once last year. This time, I think Hong Kong people probably recognize real "snow" now?

### Selected Summer Poems

The small pavilion is open on all four sides in the square pond, after bathing, I lean on the railing to enjoy the cool evening, the wind and waves are calm in the willow boundary and lotus sky, how can I bear to startle the two mandarin ducks. (Qin Yiting's Beating the Heat)

Leisurely flipping through the words of Chu poets on the ebony table, where is the beauty who stirs my thoughts, the cool wind blows the inkstone pool green, I occasionally write a few orchids. (Wang Zhu's Garden Beating the Heat Poem)

Bishan's home has a pure flavor, the bamboo bed is stable, and the table is wide and flat, there are no lamps and candles in the pavilion because there is much wind, the waterfall sounds like the moon is bright in the middle of the night. (Gong Banqian's Mountain Home)

Trying to open flowers in the courtyard at dusk, the cool moon is hazy through the green gauze, blown into my half-awakened dream in the third watch, the faint fragrance rests slanted on my jade hairpin. (Guo Xiu's Quiet Night Comes to Check)

The whole lake is covered with lotus leaves, making it impossible to pass, the misty peaks horizontally block the window, the pillow and mat are secluded, the mountain man with short robes is as pure as a swan, and the sand birds fly up to the bamboo curtain hook. (Tao Hong's Inscription on Painting)

The shimmering light ripples on the misty water, the pond pavilion is cool in the evening after the rain, the west wind blows the fallen red leaves, and I see the mandarin ducks sleeping freely. (An Qi's Fireflies)

With ice and snow as her complexion and jade as her bones, her gentle feelings should be near the latticed window, the fragrance is felt when she returns from a clear dream, and the flower blooms on the beauty's head. (Wang Shilu's End of the Beautiful Words)

The roosting crows are quiet and do not fly all night long, the dew is so cool that it penetrates the silk clothes, the jade horse also understands people's good intentions, and slowly returns, treading on the flower shadows. (Zhao Yi's Returning Home at Night in Fragrant Hills)

The reflection of the first moon is faintly visible in the clear pond, and coolness is born after the rain, penetrating my kudzu clothing, ten miles of chaotic cicadas blowing on both sides of the wind, and the fragrance of lotus flowers sends the fishing boat home. (Heng Ren's Scenes Outside the South West Gate)

The new rain welcomes autumn and wants to fill the pond, the elm trees provide cool shade in the afternoon breeze, no one has come to the water pavilion for several days, let the lotus flowers be fragrant freely. (Zhang Wentao's Lotus Flowers)

### Idle Talk about Watermelon

— Zong Qi

When the cries of "Yangmei black Yangmei" disappear from the alleys, what replaces them is "Watermelon, watermelon, Tiger Yellow watermelon." So let's talk about watermelon.

Watermelon is also known as cold melon, presumably because of its cold nature. It is commonly called watermelon because it comes from the Western Regions and is transplanted to China, hence the name watermelon.

According to the history of the Five Dynasties, the watermelon was transplanted to China when Hu Han brought back melon seeds from the Khitans during the Five Dynasties (according to modern Hami County, Xinjiang, because there are many fertile fields and sweet springs nearby, the Hami melons produced are still famous). He mixed the seeds with cow dung, and the melons that grew were large and sweet, named watermelon. According to this, watermelon was a native product of the Khitans and was only introduced to China during the Five Dynasties. Another saying is that watermelon was originally produced in eastern Zhejiang, especially those produced in Yongjia, and gradually spread throughout the country. In my humble opinion, the former is more credible.

Today, the production of watermelon is most prevalent in Jiangnan. The Three Whites of Pinghu and the Tiger Yellows of Sanlintang in Pudong are all juicy and sweet, so they have long been famous throughout the region. Now, Pinghu and Sanlintang have become things of the past. At this time when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, the terror of food and clothing is tightly gripping the throats of farmers. It is natural for melon fields to be turned into rice fields. Even if some are occasionally planted, the countryside cannot sell them for a good price. If they are transported to Shanghai, they must be subjected to heavy taxes. Sometimes, the melons in the melon fields are often forcibly eaten for no reason.

The price of watermelons this year is truly beyond the dreams of us poor folks, but I dare to believe that next year today, we can often enjoy the Tiger Yellow and Three White watermelons to our heart's content.

### From Using Reading to Beat the Heat to Methods of Reading

Summer days are long, making it the best season for reading. Although those who feel interested in reading are extremely increasing their reading enjoyment in every season.

However, one must have appropriate methods for reading in order to truly benefit from reading. According to the young American philosopher Adler - who is a dedicated promoter of the Renaissance at the University of Chicago and has great prestige in the American reading community - the best method for reading is to utilize writing. The following is his theory and method.

Buying a book is only the prologue to owning the book. Unless you transform the material in the book into a part of yourself, you cannot actually say that you own that book. If you want to absorb the material in the book, then you need to do some writing. This kind of writing has several advantages:

1. It can keep you alert while reading.

2. Because true reading is really the work of thought, and thought needs to be expressed through writing or speaking.

3. After the work of writing, you can put the material from the book into your mind, so that you are facing the author and having the most congenial conversation, which is the greatest joy of reading.

Of course, this refers to books that require more thought or seek to answer questions. Ordinary novels and leisure books, aimed at whiling away the time, can be read casually.

As for reading with writing methods, it can be divided into several types:

1. Use underlining to highlight the important parts of the text.

2. Draw lines next to the text, that is, in the blank spaces of the book.

3. Use asterisks or other symbols to mark important places, so that you can immediately see the important parts when you flip through them in the future.

4. Write numbers in the blank spaces next to the text, so that the important points of the whole book are recorded in order.

5. Write page numbers next to the text to indicate that there is an equal discussion on a certain page.

6. Circle the important words and phrases.

7. Write your own questions in the blank spaces, and add the answers if possible. After this work, not only does the material in the book become a part of you, but even your book, because you have spent so much effort on it, you are unwilling to lend it out easily, and you want it to always be your possession. ·Li Sihua·

### Ten Summer Pleasures

— Chen Nianyun

The sun is blazing, and the heat is oppressive. Confined in a small room, I feel bored and listless. But others may feel so, but I do not. Because the pleasures of the world are truly boundless, and those who understand can get them. Therefore, I have created ten summer pleasures.

Get up before dawn, go to the sun deck to watch the sunrise, or stroll on the street to breathe fresh air: at this time, the gentle breeze caresses my face, making my heart feel refreshed, this is the first pleasure.

Fill several empty glass bottles with plain boiled water and put them in the water tank to serve as a drink for the day. It is clear and clean, can quench thirst, and is economical and hygienic, this is the second pleasure.

After breakfast, read the newspaper, big or small, take it all in. If there is a work that pleases me, I recite it three times. It increases my knowledge and my intelligence, this is the third pleasure.

Go out to work, walking slowly, again and again, humming a marching song. Although the journey is long, I do not feel it is bitter, this is the fourth pleasure.

After lunch, when the sun is high in the sky, steal some leisure from the busy schedule and take a short rest, half asleep and half awake, calm my mind, put everything aside, feel relaxed all over, as if I am in an air-conditioned room, this is the fifth pleasure.

Return home after work, feeling a load off my mind, prepare a basin of hot water, scrub my whole body with medicated soap, removing all the accumulated dirt, feel refreshed in body and mind, this is the sixth pleasure.

After bathing, sit for a while, and then dinner is set before me. I wash the hot rice with cool boiled water, it is warm but not cold, and eat it with dried radish and preserved vegetables. After chewing, the taste is better than delicacies, this is the seventh pleasure.

Enjoy the cool air in a high place after dinner, or listen to the singing of my little children, innocent and charming, or gather with two or three close friends to talk about everything under the sun, losing myself in delight, this is the eighth pleasure.

Write a diary entry before going to bed, read a few pages of my favorite books, or a few chapters of poetry, sweeping away all the gloom in my heart, this is the ninth pleasure.

At this time, my body is cool, my eyelids are dry, I go to bed and ask myself if I have not let anyone down, if I have not let myself down, I feel at ease in my body and mind, and I fall asleep, this is the tenth pleasure.

### Air Conditioning Cloth

— Chen Lihua

I gave it the name "air conditioning cloth" because major buildings, major theaters, dance halls... all have air conditioning installed in the summer, but in ordinary households? It's considered good to have an electric fan, but the electricity bill is expensive and not cost-effective. So the only thing to do is to work with your hands and use a fan instead, but that's very tiring, so it's best to save money and effort and make your body feel cooler.

Therefore, I came up with a method, although it is not as good as air conditioning, but its heat-reducing effect is not small. It's good to save money and effort, so it's worth using.

If you sprinkle some water on the ground at noon or in the afternoon of a hot day, it will dry in a short time, which indicates that part of the water is being absorbed by the sunlight (heat). If there is no part of the water, then it will obviously absorb the water from our bodies, so wouldn't we feel even hotter?

So our "air conditioning cloth" is based on this principle: the method is very simple, just use any piece of cloth, soak it in water, and then hang it like a window curtain in the window or in a place exposed to sunlight. You sit behind this soaked cloth curtain and can do whatever you want, because this "air conditioning cloth" can act as a curtain or blind on the one hand, and replace the water in your body on the other hand. It is not easy for sunlight to enter, and the room feels cool. Sometimes, when a cool breeze blows by, your "air conditioning cloth" also sways with the wind, and many small droplets of water blow towards you, making you feel even cooler.

### Anglo-American Freeze on Chinese Funds and the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Market

— Sun Liyu

Following the Anglo-American order on July 26 to freeze Chinese and Japanese funds, a significant reaction occurred in the Chinese and Japanese economies, especially in the Shanghai foreign exchange market, which underwent a complete transformation. In the past, funds could be easily transferred for speculative transactions without restrictions. Now, only legitimate transactions arising from trade are possible. Although the freedom of transaction has not been completely eliminated, the difference in degree is vast. Looking back over the three and a half years since the emergence of the black market in Shanghai, the government has tried every possible means to maintain exchange rates, but ultimately failed to prevent arbitrage and speculation, rendering their efforts incomplete. Recently, after the Sino-British-American Stabilization Fund began operations, rumors circulated that it would control trading. However, without the freezing of Chinese and Japanese assets, even if control were implemented, it would only create a black market within the black market, failing to completely close loopholes. Knowing the difficulty of controlling the Shanghai foreign exchange market, informed observers hoped for the Anglo-American freeze on Chinese and Japanese funds as one hopes for rain during a severe drought. Now that it has been implemented, its benefit to the Shanghai foreign exchange market cannot be overstated. However, it is regrettable that the UK and the US cannot thoroughly enforce it for the sake of their own commercial interests and international relations.

Restriction Measures

Although the UK and the US claim to have frozen Chinese and Japanese funds, their methods differ greatly from those applied to European countries, especially the US, which is more lenient. It can only be described as a fund management license system, not a true freeze. The restriction measures of the two countries are explained below:

The US measures for freezing Chinese funds are stipulated in Implementation Orders No. 58 and No. 59. The former stipulates that the trade nature of permissible US dollar transactions must be: (1) bona fide imports and exports; (2) trade not managed or entrusted by blocked countries outside China, their people, or the people of the Three Eastern Provinces, except for those residing in China; and (3) trade not related to the interests of blocked countries outside China, their people, or the people of the Three Eastern Provinces, except for those residing in China. Considering the first condition, the term "bona fide" is quite flexible. It is difficult to explain what is bona fide and what is malicious. If supplying Japanese military needs is considered malicious and trading in daily necessities is considered bona fide, there is no clear distinction between military supplies and daily necessities, making it an insufficient standard for identification. Moreover, bona fide imported goods can easily become malicious through a simple transfer, making the distinction even more confusing. Therefore, the incompleteness of this condition is very obvious. As for the second and third conditions, the nature of the trade operators and beneficiaries are specified to prevent Japan from using China as a transshipment point, which is appropriate. However, the exclusion of people from blocked countries residing in China means that the Japanese can still use China as a transshipment point, which is also very clear. Therefore, these two conditions are also insufficient to exclude Japan's indirect trade with the US. Order No. 59 stipulates the financial institutions authorized for US dollar transactions and the trade areas authorized to receive US dollars. The former designates 14 banks from the UK, the US, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, including Chase National and Citibank, but excluding Japanese and Axis banks. The latter designates five regions: the US, American republics, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies, excluding Japan, Axis countries, and their occupied territories. The intention of the issuer of these orders is to maintain trade with China while severing commercial relations with Japan and the Axis powers. However, Shanghai itself has already developed economic ties with Japan. Even if the US does not trade directly with Japan, it cannot avoid indirect trade with Japan due to Shanghai's intermediary role. Therefore, looking at the US restriction measures, not only is the trade in luxury goods not suppressed, but also Japan's transit trade in Shanghai can proceed unhindered, except for speculative transactions. The leniency of the US freezing measures is beyond what we initially expected.

The British measures for freezing funds in China were received by British banks in Shanghai on the 30th. According to HSBC's announcement, all sterling deposits, bonds, and cash owned by various countries within China or by Chinese people in branches outside China shall be frozen. However, import and export trade with China and the sterling area will still be supported, and certain exchange transactions may continue. According to this regulation, not only is trade between China and the sterling area strictly limited, but also the sterling deposits of people of various countries in China cannot be withdrawn in legal tender at the exchange rate. This is much stricter than the US, which only restricts speculation without freezing deposits. Looking at the actual situation in Japan, the settlement of sterling for import and export trade is very difficult, and sterling is almost in a state of having prices but no market. Although this is due to a lack of detailed understanding, it is also due to the strict restrictions. Compared to the US, it seems somewhat more satisfactory.

Impact of the Freeze

Currently, the Shanghai foreign exchange market is dominated by the US dollar. Although the US freezing measures are not very thorough, they have already had a significant impact. Since the emergence of the foreign exchange black market in March 1938, it has not been easy to stabilize exchange rates due to the trade deficit with Japan, arbitrage, capital flight, and rampant speculation. The Sino-British Stabilization Fund failed due to insufficient funds, and the country lost a countless amount of foreign exchange. After the outbreak of the European war, capital flight subsided slightly, and exchange rates were able to stabilize. However, Shanghai was flooded with idle capital. Although there were no more days of turmoil, the Sino-British-American Stabilization Fund was able to support the difficult situation at the moment, but could not guarantee its effectiveness in the future. The government was afraid of the consequences of abandoning the black market, but also lacked a permanent solution to maintain it. Abandoning the black market would harm the interests of foreign merchants, jeopardizing diplomatic relations. Soaring special prices would affect the inland. Restricting supply would lead those who did not obtain foreign exchange to search for it through various channels, inevitably creating a black market within the black market, severely shrinking the exchange rate. The government was trapped in this dilemma, so it has been procrastinating until now, without establishing a permanent solution. However, this time, the UK and the US implemented a freeze on funds at China's request, which may allow China to determine its foreign exchange policy.

The biggest problems in the Shanghai foreign exchange market are the possibility of capital flight and the rampant speculation. This freeze has considerably curbed the activities of both. The British freeze on deposits and restrictions on trade have already strictly curbed speculation, which need not be discussed further. The US measure of allowing the withdrawal of US dollar deposits is also sufficient to promote the repatriation of funds held abroad. When people of various countries in China withdraw their US dollar deposits, they only collect legal tender at a proportional rate, which is to sell US dollars and exchange them for legal tender. From the perspective of the US dollar, it increases supply. From the perspective of legal tender, it strengthens demand, which should be beneficial. Moreover, some of the US dollars sold may be absorbed by the Stabilization Fund, which further strengthens the foundation of legal tender and consolidates its credit. Although exchange rates have seen a sharp decline after the news of the freeze, they have now shrunk within five yuan. However, this is actually caused by speculative merchants scrambling to cover their positions and importers using false pretenses. In the future, following the prescribed licensing system, those who settle foreign exchange must present their order forms, and the exchange rate should recover.

Moreover, this method of restricting foreign exchange is different from China's proactive foreign exchange control. As mentioned earlier, if the government selectively allocates foreign exchange based on people and goods, those who do not obtain foreign exchange will inevitably search for foreign currency deposits at high prices, creating another black market. However, this freezing method restricts the use of foreign currency deposits in their home country. Those who fail to obtain officially approved foreign exchange will find it useless even if they search for foreign currency deposits. Therefore, the implementation of the freezing method is actually a solution for China to the foreign exchange control problem in Shanghai.

Legitimate international trade can still proceed unhindered. Although Japan may be able to obtain British and American goods through this, Shanghai's supplies should not be lacking. In theory, Shanghai's special prices should not rise excessively, but hoarders are taking advantage of the freeze news, deliberately exaggerating its impact, causing a phenomenon of soaring special prices. When trade returns to normal, there is hope for a return to equilibrium.

Further Hope

Although the Anglo-American freeze on Chinese funds has already had a positive impact on China, the restrictions are too lenient to achieve the expected results. In particular, the US restriction measures have too many loopholes to fully achieve its sanctioning effect. At the time of the implementation of this freeze, we hope that the UK and the US will work closely with the Chinese government and take it one step further, so that the UK and the US can achieve their sanctioning goals, and China can enjoy the full effect of the freeze.

What are the further restriction measures? It is to completely freeze all Chinese funds and assets and allow the Chinese government to dispose of them; abandon trade in Shanghai and transfer commerce to Free China. During the First World War, the UK implemented the Securities Mobilization Act, which required the British government to register its funds and assets in the US. When necessary, the government would purchase them at a price, and the government would then sell the people's assets it had acquired in the US market, obtaining US dollars to purchase American military supplies, which was of great benefit to the British wartime economy. Before the outbreak of this European war, the UK promulgated the Foreign Securities Control Order on August 27, 1939, which still followed the previous law, ordering people holding foreign securities to register with the Bank of England within one month. The government could forcibly purchase them at any time if deemed necessary. Although the British government was reluctant to dispose of them at will for fear of affecting the market prices of British securities, it ultimately relied on this as collateral to obtain a large amount of loans, which also made a significant contribution to the wartime economy. At the beginning of the Chinese war, some Chinese advocated requisitioning funds and assets abroad. Later, when it was difficult to maintain the Shanghai foreign exchange market, this proposal became even more rampant, believing that this drastic measure could prevent capital flight and speculation, and avoid fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. However, at that time, the requisition of foreign exchange was inconsistent with the Anglo-American principle of free trade and could not be implemented. Now that the situation has changed and the UK and the US have frozen Chinese funds and assets, why not take it one step further and prohibit the withdrawal of foreign currency deposits and the transfer of foreign securities, allowing them to be entirely controlled by the Chinese government? When the government deems it necessary, it will compensate its price with government bonds or legal tender and requisition its foreign exchange. As for the requisition price, it should be converted and compensated at the exchange rate at the time of purchase. In this way, on the one hand, it can crack down on capital flight and eliminate its undue profits; and on the other hand, it can strengthen the legal tender base and its external purchasing power, benefiting the national economy.

Regarding trade, this restriction method still cannot prevent Japan from obtaining military supplies in Shanghai, as mentioned above; and because the UK and the US froze Japanese funds, Shanghai is burdened with more foreign exchange for Japanese indirect trade, which is the most incomplete. Now that the international situation is turbulent and uncertain, the trade relationship between Shanghai and the UK and the US is tenuous. If we take a broader view and look to the future, we will know that the termination of trade in Shanghai is inevitable. If the UK and the US can abandon the current small profits in Shanghai and engage in trade in Free China, not only will the future be unlimited, but also the effect of sanctions can be immediately seen. Therefore, a complete freeze or strict restriction of trade is what we most hope for.

Although the UK and the US are concerned about the drastic changes in the international situation and the damage to Shanghai's century-old commercial foundation, they do not want to use severe sanctioning methods to provoke further conflict. However, the increasingly urgent situation in Southeast Asia has proved that appeasement is wrong. Early sanctions are the basis for a quick resolution. Thoroughly implementing the freeze will not only benefit China.

### American Severe Restriction on Oil and Japan's War Power

— Yang Feng'e

Oil is the lifeblood of modern war machines, but Japan's war needs are mostly supplied by the US and the Dutch East Indies. According to "Oil and Gas" magazine: in 1939, Japan's consumption of oil and its products was 5.8 million tons, but its domestic production was only 440,000 tons (including products made from imported oil), accounting for only 7%. The remaining 93% of its needs depended entirely on imports. At that time, the US supplied him with 3.54 million tons, and the Dutch East Indies supplied him with 1.6 million tons. At this time, the US had already managed oil exports, but exports to Japan were still so high. Japan had exhausted its efforts to increase production, but its gains were still so meager. It is clear that if the US implemented an embargo on oil to Japan, it could immediately control Japan's fate. Now, the US has officially ordered the prohibition of machine oil and other exports to foreign countries on August 1. Although Japan is not mentioned in the order, it is actually aimed at Japan. The Dutch East Indies also abolished the Dutch-Japanese oil agreement after the UK and the US froze Japanese funds. So how long can Japan support itself? This is an interesting question.

88.6% of Peacetime Consumption Depends on Imports

As soon as the Sino-Japanese war began, Japan stopped publishing statistics on oil imports and domestic production, so it is difficult to investigate Japan's current supply and demand situation. But his usual materials are enough for our reference.

The Japan Petroleum Association still publishes the Japanese oil supply and demand statistics table made in the 11th year of Showa (1936), which is still the latest of those statistics that are publicly published. They combine the refined products of imported crude oil and the refined products of domestic crude oil as domestic products. Therefore, in the total supply of Japanese oil in the 11th year of Showa, domestic products are estimated to account for about 43%. In fact, the total amount of domestic crude oil and its products is only about 10%, as shown in the following table:

Japanese domestic crude oil 104,751

Japanese products of crude oil 99,33

(A) Subtotal 104,073

Imported crude oil and products 1,243,463

Japanese products of imported crude oil 340,452

(B) Subtotal 1,583,915

Total above 1,787,988

A percentage of the total 2.4%

B percentage of the total 88.6%

(Note) Unit thousand gallons. Calculated according to "Domestic and Foreign Petroleum Statistics". Three hundred gallons equal one ton.

This means that Japan's self-sufficiency rate for oil and its products accounts for only 11.4% of the peacetime demand. Without imports, his factory machines, airplanes, cars, warships, ships, fishing boats, etc., would have to stop 88.6% in peacetime, unable to turn.

Wartime Japanese Oil Imports

Modern mechanized armies need more fuel. During the First World War, each ordinary division was about 4,000 horsepower, and now it is equivalent to 187,000 horsepower; and each mechanized division is equivalent to 2.5 million to 3.5 million horsepower. According to French newspaper reports: when the German army invaded France, each tank division consumed 1,500 tons of oil per day, and each air force division consumed 1,600 tons of gasoline per day; therefore, the entire army's daily gasoline demand reached 18,000 to 40,000 tons. Although the equipment of the Japanese army is not as good as that of the German army, there is no doubt that his wartime oil demand will increase sharply compared with peacetime.

The import situation of Japanese oil during the war, according to the survey of the United States, is roughly as follows: (unit US$1,000)

This not only points out the great increase in Japan's need for oil during the war, but also clearly indicates that the proportion of Japan's oil needs relying on the United States can also increase. Generally, people are very strange "Why didn't the United States ban the oil of combat blood at the same time when it implemented a moral embargo in mid-June 1938"? But until now, this question seems to no longer exist. Because the United States has begun to ban oil exports to Japan. And the day before the United States banned oil exports to Japan, the Dutch East Indies had abolished the oil agreement with Japan. Now we have many reasons to believe that the oil embargo to Japan by the United States and the Netherlands this time has a great determination; unless our confidence is wrong. Otherwise, no matter how much storage Japan may still have, it can be imagined that Japan has reached the difficult situation of "defeat in battle or defeat without battle." Because he wants to fight, then his poor oil conditions are really not suitable for maintaining modern warfare for long. If he still wants to avoid a head-on conflict with the United States and implement a drag, he can sit and watch the great effect of "economic sanctions" in the evolution of time.

How much oil does Japan currently have in storage

According to a joint news agency telegram on the 3rd, US Navy Secretary Knox told reporters that he guessed that Japan had one to three years of oil and gasoline storage, which was prepared for war, but he said that this was "pure speculation." Let us observe his supply again: according to the "Oil and Gas" magazine statistics, in 1939, it was 5.8 million, 3.4 million tons for civilian use, and 2.2 million tons for military use, totaling 5.6 million tons. The difference between the two numbers is 300,000 tons. Then the possible storage capacity per year will not exceed this number. No matter how actively he increases production and saves, if he stores it in this way, it will take at least twenty years to supply him with the current consumption for one year; therefore, Knox's estimate is not too low.

Bond Market News Knowledge Mr. Zhang Yifan's Lecture Chen Huijun's Notes

Shanghai University School of Commerce "Commercial News" Textbook

When the government's expenditures exceed its revenues and the financial balance is unbalanced, it often makes up for it by borrowing money, issuing treasury bills, or issuing public bonds.

Government debt without issuing bonds is called borrowing, bonds whose face value is calculated in foreign currency are called gold bonds, bonds whose value is counted in national currency are called national currency bonds, treasury bills are short-term in nature, with a term of about one year or five years, usually one year, guaranteed by the tax revenue of the current year, and the principal and interest are extracted on average every month. Therefore, it is called tax securities. Before January 28, my country had treasury bill issues, which have not been issued since the reorganization. Public bonds are long-term in nature, guaranteed by long-term national income, with interest paid on time and different repayment periods.

Public bonds issued due to financial imbalances are called fiscal public bonds. In Japan, they are called deficit public bonds, because the Japanese government writes the deficit in the revenue and expenditure budget in red, hence the name; and this name is also used in my country, and it is often seen in articles in newspapers and magazines. Most of the public bonds issued in my country in the past were deficit public bonds. After January 28, the Ministry of Finance reorganized the number of issues, extended the principal and interest, and the creditors proposed that the Ministry of Finance could not issue public bonds due to revenue and expenditure imbalances in the future, which was passed by the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, there were no deficit public bonds in the national budget for a while. Later, the previously issued public bonds were reorganized and unified public bonds were issued, divided into five types: A, B, C, D, and E according to the length of the repayment period, with face values of ten yuan, one hundred yuan, one thousand yuan, and five thousand yuan, totaling 146 million yuan, which was used to recover various old-issued public bonds and treasury bills. The interest rate is 6% per week, and the principal and interest are paid once every six months.

Different from deficit public bonds, there are industrial public bonds, which are issued to revitalize industry; railway public bonds, which are issued to build railways; military public bonds, which are issued to purchase military supplies; and national defense public bonds, which are issued to enrich national defense.

Most of the public bonds issued in China are long-term public bonds, with terms of about 30 to 50 years. The face value is mostly in unregistered form, so it can circulate freely. There is also a registered public bond in foreign countries. Registered bonds must be transferred if they need to be transferred; and there are regulations that do not allow free transfer. If registered public bonds are issued during wartime, the purpose of having money to contribute can be achieved, because who has purchased and who has not purchased are recorded; those who have not purchased can be persuaded to raise funds, so as to equalize the burden of the people.

The methods of raising funds include voluntary and compulsory. Voluntary is for the people to voluntarily subscribe, and they are all unregistered. The public bonds issued in our country are all voluntary. Compulsory is to compulsory apportion to the people. There are registered and unregistered forms. Most of the bonds issued during the warlord government era contained compulsion. After the Northern Expedition, voluntary subscription was the main method.

The price of public bonds The price of public bonds can be divided into face value market price issue price. If a public bond has a face value of 100 yuan and is issued at a 98% discount, the face value is 100 yuan, the issue price is 98 yuan, and the market price is determined by the trading in the public bond market, so the market price fluctuates.

Methods of paying back public bonds upon maturity:

Lottery —— Drawn once or twice a year, those drawn will be repaid the principal and interest, and those not drawn will pay interest.

Fixed term —— Repay the principal upon maturity, and pay interest before maturity.

When the government issued public bonds in the past, they were often issued at a 60% discount. After January 28, they were issued at a 98% discount; this discount is called the issue discount. In addition to the central government's direct issuance of government public bonds, other departments and local governments can also issue them according to their own needs. Such as the various railway public bonds of the Ministry of Communications and the various reorganization public bonds of the Zhejiang Provincial Government.

The greater the difference between the market discount (i.e., the market price) and the face value, the greater the benefit of buying public bonds. Because the repayment of the principal upon maturity or in the lottery is paid according to the face value, the thicker the profit obtained by buying at a lower face value.

### American and Indian Cotton Prices Both Fall

### Copper Reaches Highest Peak

The production areas of copper originally belonged to the United States and Japan. However, the copper produced in Japan is not enough for its own use recently, so no goods come to Shanghai. Most of the copper circulating on the market now comes from the United States. There are two types of its brand name: "T" and "TC". However, in the past month or so, because the United States has banned exports and the inventory in this port has become thin, it is feared that the spot goods will be out of stock in the future. It is found that the only use of the goods in the past was to manufacture copper coins and other items. However, since the outbreak of the war, copper coins have disappeared, and the needs of military supplies have risen instead. Therefore, one of the sales channels for copper in the market now is military supplies. However, there is a shortage of spot goods in the market, so the standard has repeatedly reached peaks. It is heard that a foreign company in the city searched around yesterday, and the one being searched had about ten tons. The industry quoted a price of 850 US dollars per ton. The company once countered the price of 800 US dollars, and finally the transaction was concluded at 820 US dollars (the above idle is the "T" brand, and the transaction is calculated in US dollars). The quoted price of "TC" brand is 800 US dollars, but there are no goods on the market.

### Matches and Candles are Priced Higher

Honeysuckle has recently seen a thinner inventory, so the market price is gradually moving towards a higher peak. After the previous price was 580 yuan, it suddenly rose to an unprecedented new high price of 700 yuan yesterday. The increase before and after has reached more than 200 yuan.

### Summer Decline in Woolen Fabrics

The summer sales of woolen fabrics have recently become quite outdated and declining. Regardless of whether it's for Chinese or Western-style clothing, there is currently no intention to replenish stocks. Looking back at shop sales, there's also very little movement of summer goods. Observing the transactions of general street vendors and brokers, the majority involve autumn and winter goods. Regarding the market for autumn and winter goods, standard prices have been continuously rising in recent ten-day periods, with particularly noticeable and unusual increases recently.

### Sugar and Sugarcane (Part 5 - China)

— Gao Jiannong

As mentioned before, Persians likely knew how to make white granulated sugar in the 6th century AD, and Egyptians had already produced rock candy by the 8th century AD. When and how did this refining technology of sugarcane sugar begin and progress in our country? Although the "Sugar Frost Treatise" states, "Sugarcane is planted everywhere," specifically mentioning "Fuzhou, Siming, Panyu, and Guanghan, thus having 'sugar ice' and Ning being the best," we can determine that this "sugar ice" refers to sugar lumps made by boiling sugarcane juice, definitely not what we now call "rock candy." However, the "frost" produced at that time was already "light white," which must be considered a kind of progress in the sugar-making industry. The "Sugar Frost Treatise" also states: "In the early Xuanhe period—around 1120 AD—Wang..." However, due to the incompleteness of the document, we cannot know how "extraordinary" the sugarcane sugar produced at that time was. According to the French Encyclopedia, China hired sugar-making technicians from Egypt around 1250 AD—after the Mongols had destroyed the Jin dynasty, conquered Eastern Europe, and established the Golden Horde—to improve the sugar-making industry. This statement probably has its basis, but it cannot be proven from Chinese history. In his "Guangyang Miscellaneous Notes," Liu Jizhuang of the early Qing dynasty said: "Before the Jiajing era—before 1522 AD—there was no white sugar in the world (the word 'world' of course refers only to China). The sugar refined by the Min people was all brown sugar. During the Jiajing era, at a sugar bureau, a roof tile accidentally fell into the funnel. Upon inspection, the sugar at the top was as white as frost and tasted exceptionally sweet, different from usual. The middle was yellow sugar, and the bottom was black sugar. Surprised! They then took mud and pressed it on the sugar, succeeding every time. White sugar first appeared in the world from then on..." From this perspective, it seems that our people did not learn to make real white granulated sugar until the mid-16th century AD, which is many years later than foreign countries. Strictly speaking, I cannot definitively say that such an accidental "roof tile falling into the mud" event was impossible! However, the mid-16th century was when our country's maritime ban was greatly relaxed and trade with the Portuguese was frequent—the Portuguese leased Macau in 1557—I always suspect that the progress of our sugar industry at this time was directly learned from their methods.

Spring and Autumn (Essays)

### How to Serve a Young Master

— Fang Xiu

Hoping parents will take note

After exhausting countless favors and words, I was finally introduced by a friend of my father to a "mansion" to be a "private tutor." I was very happy, but that happiness was mixed with a component of fear, because I was still a "greenhorn"! But now I had to teach four children, from first grade to second grade of junior high school, which was really exhausting.

The next day was the day I "took office." I specially put on a pair of "Russian leather shoes" and, braving the strong sun, walked towards the "mansion."

Walking through the gate of the mansion, there was a courtyard. Several "young masters" were happily skating. When they saw me, they stared at me strangely and then went back to playing on their own. The youngest even rode his tricycle to me, looked at me, and then turned the car around and drove back contentedly. Passing through their "grand playground," was the parlor. I sat alone in the parlor for half an hour before the "master" lazily came out, stretching and yawning. He greeted me briefly with a listless voice, then introduced his young masters to me and sighed with a shake of his head, "Alas! Good-for-nothings, good-for-nothings, all extremely naughty! I hope the teacher will guide them more in the future. Ha!"

I said some polite words modestly and felt that my underwear was soaked with sweat.

On the third day, because class was supposed to start at nine o'clock, I rushed over at seven forty-five, intending to allocate their courses today. Who knew that after waiting in the parlor until ten o'clock, the young masters still hadn't "arrived." I was really getting anxious. To be honest, I hadn't even had breakfast yet! A servant girl next to me said, "You should come later. The young masters don't get up until eleven thirty every day! They watch plays until after one o'clock at night!"

At twelve o'clock, the "young masters" finally "graced us with their presence." The eldest was still wearing skates; the second and third were carrying billiard cues and paddles, slapping them all the way in; the fourth was still riding that tricycle, still chewing on candied lotus seeds. The "big troop" "charged" in with a clatter, but none of them brought books. This really made it difficult for me. What could I use to teach these naughty children? So I asked them, "Haven't you bought your books yet?"

"Books?" The eldest replied, "Dad said in a few days!" "What about the books you read last semester?" "Tore them up long ago!" "I still have one!" said a little one, and then he took the tricycle from the parlor, pedaled it in, and came out after a while, handing me a book. I took it and opened it. Heavens! It turned out to be a serial comic book about some knight.

It was time to divide the classes. After a long time, I finally decided how to divide their grades. But the eldest insisted on studying junior high school three and said loudly, "I was in junior high school two last semester!"

"I was in fifth grade last semester! I want to study junior high school one now!"

"I am…" Whirr, whirr, my mind was completely confused. As a result, I promoted them each one grade, and they all smiled happily and contentedly.

"Okay, now I'll test your level!" I said and wrote a very simple character to ask the youngest child who wanted to read third grade, "What character is this?" He shook his head impatiently and said, "You didn't teach me!" Then I asked the others, fourth grade, junior high school one, junior high school two, and all three gave the same answer. Moreover, they all slipped out to play after sitting for less than a quarter of an hour.

The books were bought. The eldest bought many hardcover original Western books and many reference dictionaries. In addition to textbooks, the younger ones also bought many elementary school entrance examination guides, model Chinese dictionaries, and things like that. This really gave me a headache. Which one should I teach first within three scenes a day?

Every day, the same old thing. The eldest young master, the second young master, and the third young master tied those thick books together and bound them behind the fourth young master's tricycle on the ground; the fourth young master dragged them into the "study" with a whirring sound, the younger ones following the older ones. When they got to the desks, they all collapsed on the sofa and sat together in a mess. Then the eldest young master would ask many questions: "Which came first, the chicken or the egg?" "Why does the fart that comes out smell bad?" "Why is the stool that comes out yellow?" "…?" Endless questions! The second young master and the third young master would clamor for me to tell jokes, tell stories, and even play ping pong with them! What about the fourth? He would take out some rented serial comic books and want me to tell them to him, and also want me to compare whose palm is bigger and whose legs are thinner… On Sundays, the eldest would drag me to the cinema, while the younger one wanted me to accompany him to the park… It really made my head spin! But if I offended them, they would immediately throw a young master's tantrum: "I'm not going to school!" This was a great threat to me! …

Can things go on like this day after day?

### Talking About Employment Agencies

— Zhang Guoxian

General "matchmaking shops" are now called "employment agencies."

I heard that employment agencies welcome older domestic workers. "Older" means experienced; "old mouths" are said to be much more capable when they are older. "Original households" are the slowest to sell because Shanghai families prefer more nimble workers to avoid getting entangled in unclear situations. "Original households" are those who have just come from the countryside. However, some honest families like "original households" because they take them to be more honest. Actually, they can soon become "slippery."

The introduction fee earned by employment agencies is calculated in proportion to the wages. According to the recent regulations of their guild: roughly, the employer and the employee each pay 20%... In Shanghai, the most sought-after are wet nurses.

Editor's note: According to the recent market: for maids and older servants with wages of three yuan or more, the introduction fee is 50 cents per yuan for the employer and 25 cents for the employee; in addition, there is a guarantee fee of 50 cents (2 yuan for wet nurses), paid by the employer. For wet nurses, three months' wages are paid in advance, and the introduction fee is 1 yuan 20 cents per yuan, with 60 cents for the employee. From this, it seems that employment agencies welcome wet nurses the most. But introducing a wet nurse is also a troublesome procedure. Some employers are very serious, such as requiring the wet nurse to test her body and test her blood; they don't want those who are a little worse.

In this season of oversupply of labor, employment agencies can be said to be full of talent. However, most housewives in general middle-class families cook for themselves and cannot afford to hire help.

From the perspective of employment agencies, this will naturally affect their business.

However, there is still no need for people to worry: many "old mouth" domestic workers, when they are introduced to an employer, will first ask about side income? See if the employer's house is big enough? Is the sleeping area good? What are the "work standards"? How many people are there? If they are not satisfied, they simply pat their butts and leave. At that time, the employment agency authorities still have to worry about the cost of a bowl of noodles.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Eleven. Phantom of the Opera

"Dad, now you can finally rest assured, right? From now on, I will never do such a silly thing again, wasting my energy and making you angry!"

"I'm afraid it's not that easy, is it?" Begonia knew very well how annoyed the Second Master Shang would be after losing this future cash cow for nothing, so he still felt very uneasy, fearing that after a while, Manager Meng and Second Master Shang would come to make trouble.

Meibao, however, didn't feel there was anything to worry about and happily went to prepare food for Little Gouzi and his brothers. - These days, they were harvesting cotton in the fields, and the food they needed had to be prepared by her and sent to them.

Until she returned to her room with Begonia in the evening, she was still a person without any worries. The matter of learning opera seemed to have been completely forgotten. However, how many people's hearts can be as innocent as hers? Otherwise, the world would indeed seem too quiet!

As soon as she entered the Meng family, she felt that the situation was not right.

"Oh, you've come?" Second Master Shang said to her first with an iron-blue face.

Meibao knew that just talking would not work, so she immediately pulled the small inner manager of the Meng family aside and softly told her about her plan to send ten yuan to Second Master Shang in a few days. Sister-in-law Meng was also completely inexperienced and had a rough temperament. When she heard this, she thought it was right, of course. But how could Second Master Shang be willing to spit out the fat meat that was already in his mouth?

He insisted on not taking a penny and used many extremely rude and overbearing words to threaten Meibao - he had simply become another person - to continue learning opera from him. At the same time, Old Manager Meng was also saying many things to complain about Meibao. Although Meibao knew very well that these were baseless things, and it was Sister-in-law Meng who had initially suggested pulling her over, three or four people from the Meng family were blaming her in unison for ruining everything. She was a fifteen-year-old child, so it was of course difficult for her to defend herself.

Everyone discussed for more than an hour. Meibao worried that her father might have woken up, so she had to beg Sister-in-law Meng, hoping that they could talk again another day. (181)

### Comparison of Fluorescent Lamps and Ordinary Lamps

— Zhong Han

It is true that fluorescent lamps save more electricity than tungsten lamps. A 40-watt tungsten bulb gets so hot that it's scalding to the touch, while the same 40-watt fluorescent lamp doesn't feel hot when touched. To use a technical term: only a small portion of the 40 watts of electrical energy in a tungsten lamp is converted into light energy; the rest is converted into unnecessary heat energy. I have used a light meter to measure the light intensity of various lamps and found that a 40-watt fluorescent lamp can be worth more than a 75-watt GE tungsten lamp. Fluorescent lamps have a large light source area, reduce shadows, have a soft light color, and have no glare that hurts the eyes. These are their significant advantages, but they also have their disadvantages. Because there are more accessories, the chances of damage and repair also increase. The price of bulbs is too expensive; a medium-sized tube costs 5 US dollars. If you calculate 18 yuan to 1 US dollar, it will be worth 90 yuan in national currency. A GE bulb is only 2 yuan each. The difference between the two cannot be measured in distance. The position of the lamp should be fixed. It is inconvenient to move it often, and it is more easily damaged in shaky places. If the filament of a tungsten bulb breaks, it is ruined, which is very obvious. But this is not the case with fluorescent bulbs; the signs of failure are not very obvious and are not easy to detect. In this way, the issue of advantages and disadvantages lies in the life of the bulb. Although the life of a bulb can be as long as four or five thousand hours or as short as several hundred hours, the average is 2,500 hours. If each lamp is used for an average of 6 hours per day, then each lamp can be used for a year and a half.
