### America Decides to Aid China with Materials, Supplying China with Important War Equipment

Negotiations on Aircraft Purchase Underway Between Both Parties; Implementation to Commence Upon Congressional Approval

Washington – U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau declared that President Roosevelt intends to apply his plan of leasing armaments and military equipment to Britain, and also to China and Greece, stating that this plan can be applied to any country when the President deems it necessary. It has been noted that some members of Congress view the U.S. President's extensive leasing of military equipment plan as a step to circumvent the Johnson Act (which prohibits lending to any defaulting nation). Morgenthau stated that the implementation of this new plan would depend on Congressional approval, and Chinese officials stationed in Washington have already discussed with the U.S. Treasury Department methods for transporting fighter planes. The difficulty lies in the fact that the existing number of American aircraft is insufficient to supply them. Unofficial sources close to the President said that the United States deeply believes that China has been able to contain Japan and is therefore in a better position than Britain. Furthermore, the planes used by Japan are rarely new and high-altitude, and the gasoline used is also very poor, so planes that are considered obsolete in the United States can still be used by China. The U.S. Treasury Secretary also stated that the chairman of the British Purchasing Commission, Purvis, had met with the President at the White House to discuss and present Britain's needs. Purvis said, "The President's plan truly opens a new era in American policy. I will wait quietly for Congress's opinion." (31st All-American News Agency Dispatch)

Washington – In response to questions regarding the U.S. lending war equipment to Greece and China, U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated that President Roosevelt's plan to lease war equipment could be applied to anyone, and the scope of application of this plan would depend on Congress. According to the original suggestion of the American President, it was "to lease military supplies to Britain if a situation arises where direct payment methods are no longer available."

### Sino-British Loan Extended for Half a Year

New York – Columbia Broadcasting Corporation and the National Broadcasting Company have recently reported hearing from the British Broadcasting Corporation that the British government has decided to extend the Sino-British short-term credit agreement for another six months in order to encourage China to use the British loan of £10 million to purchase British goods.

Malayan Federation – To Levy Income Tax

Singapore – It is currently believed here that the Straits Settlements and the Malayan Federation may implement an income tax due to a committee's proposal to levy a war tax on people's income. (31st United Press Dispatch)

### Utilizing Flying Fortresses, Bombing Japan Becomes Possible

New York "Herald Tribune" reported yesterday that Rear Admiral Towers, head of the Naval Aviation Technical Division, and other experts jointly requested massive aircraft assistance to China. The "Herald Tribune" published a Washington authoritative source stating that the United States will soon assist China with at least four hundred warplanes. Rear Admiral Towers stated that China's needs cannot be ignored, and four hundred is only the minimum quantity. The newspaper stated that Chinese officials currently in Washington are strongly advocating for China's need for new-style aircraft because Japan is using the new Messerschmitt fighter planes. The newspaper stated that the planes given to China will include six of the U.S. Army's famous "Boeing" "Flying Fortresses." The newspaper pointed out that this type of aircraft will enable China to take the offensive against Japan and conduct night raids. This news from the "Herald Tribune" was revealed after President Roosevelt's "fireside chat." In his speech, President Roosevelt praised China's "great defense" in the East and promised to do his best to aid China with materials. The current plan to supply aircraft to China has been delayed because Britain's need for aircraft is far more urgent than China's. What China wants is at least one hundred or four hundred fighter planes, plus a small number of long-range bombers. T.V. Soong has not yet signed the loan agreement for 100 million U.S. dollars with the Export-Import Bank because there are currently no ready-made goods such as aircraft available. Well-informed sources do not believe that the United States will hand over the latest aircraft to China, but they know that the U.S. Army has a batch of earlier-period Flying Fortresses, about seventeen, which can probably be given to China for use. This batch of large aircraft has now been replaced by newer models. This type of Flying Fortress can fly continuously for 3,000 miles at a time, carry two tons of bombs, and fly at 250 miles per hour. If China obtains this, it can bomb Japan every night. The relevant authorities stated that the U.S. Army's bombers are gradually being put aside for scrap and must be replaced with new models, so a part of the existing aircraft should be available for China to use. U.S. government officials and Chinese Ministry of Finance personnel have been negotiating the purchase of aircraft for a long time, but the entire plan has not yet been agreed upon.

### President's Fireside Chat – A Powerful Warning to Japan

Washington – Many government officials believed yesterday that President Roosevelt's fireside chat on Sunday night was an anti-Japanese message and also released a historic U.S. Far East policy. Federal Security Administrator McNutt told United Press reporters, "The speech is tantamount to warning Japan and the other two Axis countries that the United States is prepared to maintain the interests of democratic countries by military means." McNutt also praised the President's speech, calling it "completely brave and straightforward." Democratic Senator Sherman believed that Roosevelt's remarks about the Far East were quite important. He said, "The President announced to the world that the United States will not accept the philosophy of dictators in Asia, just as it will not accept the philosophy of dictators in Europe, the same stance." Political observers have focused on the President's words about the "Hawaiian Fleet," all believing that it is enough to create a deep impression. They believe that these words are tantamount to indicating that the U.S. fleet will remain stationed in Hawaii for a long time before the tense situation in the Far East is resolved. They also believe that it can be regarded as a warning that the U.S. fleet is prepared to resist any actions that infringe on U.S. interests. In his speech, the President placed Japan in the same position as Germany and Italy and solemnly declared that the Tripartite Pact is a threat to the United States. He also refused to accept Yosuke Matsuoka's assurance that the Axis alliance is not aimed at the United States. In addition, one thing worth noting is that Roosevelt condemned the so-called new order in both Europe and Asia with an attitude of condemnation. (31st United Press Dispatch)

Washington – People here expect Tokyo to repeatedly read, study, and ponder the U.S. President's remarks about the Eastern Axis in his "fireside chat." The fact that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's statement that if the United States does not change its foreign policy, which is opposed by Japan, then there will only be war, is not valued by the United States and cannot have the slightest impact. President Roosevelt has clearly stated this in his speech, and nothing can be added. There is a section in the President's speech, only one sentence, "Our fleet is in the Pacific." The President paused deliberately before and after this sentence, without adding other words, because the meaning of this sentence is extremely obvious and there is no need for redundant words. The President also clearly declared that he sees China's resistance to Japan as a part of the struggle of democratic countries against evil forces seeking world conquest and domination. The New York Times commented on Japan in an ironic tone, saying that Japan is trying its best to imitate Germany's behavior and wants to use Thailand like Hitler used the Sudetenland. But if it goes beyond Korea and the three northeastern provinces of China and incorporates them into Japan's territory, what will Thailand's awareness be? (31st Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo – The Yomiuri Shimbun criticized U.S. President Roosevelt's broadcast, saying that the U.S. President's policy is now driving the United States closer to war. The U.S. President's claim that he believes the Axis countries will eventually fail can be regarded as a completely irresponsible statement. Regardless of how the situation will be next year, the United States must bear half the responsibility. Official criticism of President Roosevelt's speech is still unknown, as Japan's official New Year holiday officially began on December 28, and government and administrative agencies will not resume work until January 4. However, after reviewing the opinions of the responsible parties, it can be found that well-informed Japanese people all believe that President Roosevelt has intentionally ignored and not heard Japan's repeated statements that the purpose of the Tripartite Pact is not directed at the United States and that Japan's "East Asian New Order" is not due to imperialist purposes. President Roosevelt's claim that the Axis countries' new order aims to enslave the world through an unholy alliance has reportedly caused particular dissatisfaction among Japanese people, who say that Japan's point of view has been restated by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka in his speech at the welcoming ceremony for the new U.S. Ambassador Nomura at the Japan-America Association on December 19.

### Smuggling of Japanese Goods Decreases in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region

Zheng County – The economic war against Japan in North China is still in full swing. Since the establishment and strengthening of the organization of the Cargo Inspection Association of the Economic Committee of North China, the monthly leakage of 8 million yuan in Henan Province has gradually been stopped. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Inspection Association was established in May of this year. Seized cases are handled by three methods: confiscation, fines, and tax supplements. The main Japanese smuggled goods are textiles, cigarettes, and pigments, followed by stationery and sundries, with very few medical supplies and hardware. Due to the promotion of inspection work, the tax revenue of various tax authorities is booming, exceeding the past by several times. The reporter patrolled along the river and saw that the work in Zhengzhou, Luohe, Jieshou and other places was very tense. It is reported that the Japanese side has banned the inflow of British and American goods into the guerrilla areas in the interior of China. (30th Dispatch)

Editorial

### Welcoming 1941

Today is New Year's Day, January 1, 1941, according to the Gregorian calendar. In China: tracing back to the ascension to the throne of the Yellow Emperor's Jiazi, it has been 4,638 years; creating the Republic, it is the 30th year of the Republic of China; beginning the great cause of resisting and rebuilding, it has been five years, and today is the fourth New Year's Day in hardship.

This year's New Year's Day will not only be celebrated because of the change of the year and welcomed with the removal of the old and the establishment of the new. Embracing hope is often a powerful encouragement and often a factor of success, but this year, we have grasped what we hope for. The dark night has indeed passed, and the dawn has begun to reveal a new atmosphere. Loyal and tempered people have jointly embarked on a glorious and bright future. This is not a prayer, but a clearly visible trend, a fact that can be expected and is just around the corner. Dear readers! The seven necessities of life are the same for every household, every day, but modern life has eight things; reading the newspaper is the first of the eight. The first thing reported to readers on the first day of this year is that this year is the year of victory, that is, the suffering and price paid over the past four or five years, and this year should be the harvest.

The world's turmoil began in the Far East with the September 18th Incident in 1931; like the spread of an epidemic, like the pushing of waves, like the penetration of water, like the spread of fire, day after day, place after place, the turmoil has become so vast and profound to the current situation; it is very likely that it will finally end in the Far East! Of course, either because China's planned general counter-offensive has reaped the scheduled achievements, or because the strengthening of international pressure has taken effect, or because the invaders' internal exhaustion has collapsed, causing the Far East situation to turn sharply downward and end earlier than elsewhere; this is within expectations and a reasonable step. But even if we don't think so and assume that the Far East will inevitably end later, since other places will inevitably be unable to withstand several decisive large-scale offensives in modern warfare and will not be difficult to end, the Far East will closely follow the end of other places and end. Let's review today before the large-scale offensive. On the side of the Allied Three: the apparent discord between them, the partial and ineffective cooperation, the frequent failure of their recent international plans, the irreparable remedy for their congenital poverty and acquired damage, and the fact that their essence of war is neither progress nor victory, but decline and failure, are all explained by facts. On the side opposing the alliance: China is advancing towards the final victory through self-reliance and foreign aid, Britain has overcome the crisis and turned to an advantage, and Greece is continuing its unexpected great victory; although the United States does not directly participate in the war, it has recently openly declared that its success or failure is consistent with that of China, Britain, and Greece, and is doing its utmost to help the three countries with its great and unparalleled national power to win victory; the three countries firmly insist on their determination to resist, and the United States also recognizes that it is engaged in a short-sighted attempt at peace. Comparing the two, China, Britain, and Greece will undoubtedly win. The allied countries will undoubtedly be defeated. They are destined to be defeated, but because it is difficult to get off the tiger, they still take risks in the hope of luck, and will soon try several decisive large-scale offensives, which is bound to happen. It is easy to imagine and does not prevent judgment: several decisive large-scale offensives will be between spring and summer this year, or even before summer, and it will be difficult to endure past autumn. Autumn is the natural harvest season!

Of course, who knows that you can't get something for nothing, you can't sit and wait for the harvest, and in the last moment before the harvest, you must shed the last blood and sweat. A year's plan lies in spring. How should we prepare for the exchange of the last blood and sweat this year, and how should we adapt to the arrival of the final victory? Under the belief of certain victory, while welcoming the New Year's Day of 1941, everyone is willing to solemnly and reverently accept this topic.

### This Year's Precious Gift

The head of a country that has not yet directly participated in the war can righteously and sternly issue a speech like the one the day before yesterday, denouncing Germany, Italy, and Japan, and supporting China, Britain, and all anti-aggression countries. This is only possible for the United States, which finally suddenly participated in the European War at the end, and determined the victory of Britain and France in one fell swoop, and for the United States, which determined China's integrity with a "Open Door" declaration when the imperialist powers jointly conspired to divide China in the 19th century, to have such courage. Moreover, only Roosevelt, who has been re-elected as the head of state for three terms and is deeply supported by the American people, dares to represent 150 million American citizens and speak boldly. Observing the current and future situation of the international community, this speech has epoch-making significance!

President Roosevelt, in his speech, specifically clarified the plan to keep the United States from getting involved in the war, which is to do its best to help China and Britain defeat the Axis powers and Japan. In such assistance from the United States, of course, there is a crisis of direct conflict between itself and the three countries; Roosevelt must have estimated this crisis before resolutely making this final decision. Analytically speaking, he is doing his best to help China and Britain defeat the three countries with the determination to participate in the war, and still hopes that the United States can eventually avoid the pain of war. Comparing the advantages and disadvantages, Roosevelt's speech has been clearly pointed out. The signing of the Three-Power Alliance is the first step in threatening the United States; for the past three months, spokespersons at all levels in Germany, Italy, and Japan have repeatedly echoed each other and threatened the United States, which is the second step; and in the past few days, the German fleet, with Japan's cooperation, has begun to attack British ships in the Pacific. In this third step, the tentacles of war have indeed extended to the Pacific. Since the situation has forced the United States to approach the front line, the United States will not hesitate to fight, let alone help China and Britain. For this reason, after Roosevelt's speech, the plan for the United States to lend a large number of weapons to China was revealed far and wide. As detailed in the telegram, no further citations are needed. Although there is a considerable distance in space and time from the present to the establishment and implementation of the plan, the sincerity and real support for China that this shows has also become a precious gift that China is happy to accept.

Chongqing – Foreign Minister Wang hosted a banquet for the Burmese journalist delegation at noon on the 30th, with many government leaders accompanying. During the banquet, Wang delivered a speech, roughly saying that although the delegation's visit to Chongqing coincided with the fog season, the broken walls and rubble were visible everywhere, which proved the difficulties we encountered and the people's and government's determination to fight to the end. He then spoke of the geographical and historical relationship between China and Burma, and the intimacy of their friendship, discussed the opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road and its benefits to both parties, and finally said that China's spirit of fighting has become stronger and stronger over time, and hoped that the journalist delegation would convey this to the Burmese people. The deputy leader of the delegation, U Tun Tin, then gave a reply to express his gratitude. (31st Dispatch)

### Large Numbers of Japanese Troops Concentrate Near Guangzhou

Chongqing – Here, many speculations have been aroused regarding the rumor that large numbers of Japanese troops are concentrated near Guangzhou. It is widely believed that since there are no signs of large-scale Japanese military operations in northern Guangdong at present, these troops may be concentrated to prepare for an attack on Hong Kong, and it is likely that they will first attack the Kowloon area. It is said that the Japanese attack on Hong Kong may coincide with the new Axis activities in Europe and the future Japanese attack on southern Vietnam. It is believed that the reopening of hostilities along the Thai border is of particular significance. Although the exact number of Japanese troops currently concentrated near Guangzhou is still unknown, it is reported that at least 50,000 Japanese troops have gathered there in the past two weeks. According to news from the former officials in Guangdong Province, it is estimated that the number of Japanese troops is between 70,000 and 80,000, but it is believed that the figure of 50,000 is more reliable.

### Nazi Military Aid to Italy, Trenches Dug on Romanian Border

Yugoslavia Feels Extremely Uneasy, German Army and Air Force Arrive in Italy from Austria

Yugoslav Capital – Travelers returning from the border yesterday stated that German troops entering Romania from Hungary in recent days have been digging trenches on the Romanian border and preparing defensive lines. According to travelers, German troops are preparing 15 miles outside the entire border of Romania. This news has caused considerable unease in Yugoslavia. German artillery positions are built at opposite locations on the South Country border. Travelers said that since December 6, 1 million to 3 million German troops have been arriving in Romania daily on 70 trains, carrying military supplies and troops through Hungary. Travelers arriving here from Slovenia reported that German "Junkers" aircraft fly from Germany to Italy in squadrons every day. (31st United Press Dispatch)

London – According to responsible sources here, in addition to several German air force squadrons in Italy, there are also four German divisions. It is reported that three of them took the train through Vienna and arrived in the Italian ports of Venice and Sicily on December 15. The fourth division, mostly composed of Austrian soldiers, crossed the Corinthian Alps and entered Trieste. This division will likely be sent to Albania or North Africa. It is reported that a large squadron of Condor-type aircraft piloted by Germans has been sent to the airfield near Endini to aid Italy. Currently, railway transportation is constant every day, so Italy is gradually receiving supplies of aircraft parts, armaments, ammunition, small tanks, small gunboats, and submarines. The submarines are disassembled and transported by train to Monfalcone in the Gulf of Trieste for assembly. (31st Reuters Dispatch)

Rome – Well-informed unofficial sources here predicted yesterday that "the most important action of the Axis countries" may occur around January 20, before and after President Roosevelt takes office. It is reported that the Axis countries have made various preparations for this large-scale move. Everything is almost ready in the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian Sea to launch… (The following content was deleted by the Italian government's press censorship office) (31st International News Agency Dispatch)

London – It is reported that German troops are heading from Austria to France, which is related to the rumor that Germany will occupy the non-occupied zone of France. Düsseldorf and neighboring cities have gathered the most German troops. German troops are constantly heading to northern France from here. Recently, Germany has actively promoted internally that it will launch a general offensive against Britain in the early spring to end the war in favor of Germany. The purpose of this propaganda seems to be to encourage the morale of the German people, which is said to have greatly declined. (31st Reuters Dispatch)

### One German Division Aids Italy in Combat, Greek Troops Advance Towards Valona

Struga – Reliable sources report that an entire German division has arrived in Albania and is currently assisting the Italian army in combat in Elbasan and Librazhd. German engineering teams have also arrived in the middle of the Durrës to Berat highway. In addition, Greek troops reoccupied the village of Lin, capturing many Italian soldiers and armaments. (31st United Press Dispatch)

Athens – A Reuters correspondent accompanying the Greek army reported that Greek troops, departing from Himara, are advancing along the coastal road towards Valona, an important base for the Italian army, and are rapidly gaining an advantage in the Keraunian Mountains. They have now controlled both sides of Polican, and fierce fighting continues around Tepelena and Klimara. When this battle is successfully concluded, it will be seen what price the Italian troops guarding the high mountains overlooking these two important places will pay, and what the spirit of the Greek troops fighting for the high mountains is. Currently, the other important matters on the Albanian front are the Italian counter-attack north of Klimara, the Italian offensive actions in the mountains east of the Aulona ridge, and the gradual advance of the Italian troops from their positions on the shore of Lake Ohrid. All these actions prevent the right wing of the Greek troops approaching Elbasan from taking large-scale actions. (31st Reuters Dispatch)

London – The Athens non-fee radio station broadcast a bulletin from the Greek Information Office stating that the enemy's defensive positions west of Lograt have been captured by Greek troops. Despite the bad weather, the Greek troops are still achieving good results on all fronts. (31st Reuters Dispatch)

### Bulgarian Foreign Minister Reaffirms Neutrality

South Bulgaria Suddenly Adopts Anti-Soviet Policies; Soviet Military Attaché in Bulgaria Replaced

Sofia: During yesterday's parliamentary debate on the budget in Bulgaria, a former minister stated that the Bulgarian people have the right to request the government to clarify its foreign policy, as the people will defend Bulgaria with their property. Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov replied that Bulgaria will not deviate from its clearly declared policy of strict neutrality, as there is no reason to change the policy of neutrality at present. Popov also mentioned the left-wing elements in Bulgaria advocating closer cooperation with the Soviet Union, saying that the Bulgarian government and parliament will not listen to the words of either the right or the left. Rumors are spreading that the staff of the Soviet embassy in Sofia will be changed soon. The newly appointed military attaché, Colonel Masarov, has recently arrived. Given the recent intensification of communist propaganda in Bulgaria, it is widely believed that there will be changes in the Soviet embassy staff. (Reuters, 31st)

Budapest: Yesterday, two Southeast European countries suddenly adopted anti-Soviet policies amidst the entry of German troops into the Balkans. This action was completely unexpected. The Soviet TASS news agency correspondent stationed in the capital of Southern Bulgaria was expelled by the Southern government on suspicion of espionage and given 24 hours to leave the country. The Southern government authorities also suppressed trade unions. A pro-neutrality Bulgarian newspaper published new and severe measures to deal with communist activities. Bulgarian police arrested a communist leader for staging a fierce demonstration demanding a military alliance with the Soviet Union. The Bulgarian government emphasized that since Bulgaria has refused to align itself with the Axis powers, it cannot sign a contradictory alliance with the Soviet Union. (International News Agency, 31st)

Sofia: Bulgarian Defense Minister Daskalov today issued a year-end statement, saying that the recovery of Southern Dobruja was the happiest event for Bulgaria this year. He continued by saying that the reputation and determination of the Bulgarian army allow the country's borders to be defended with a minimal number of troops. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)

### President Roosevelt's Speech Enthusiastically Welcomed by All Sides, But Axis Powers Express Indignation; Hitler to Respond After Study

Washington: White House Secretary O'Leary recently told reporters that the President's latest speech has received a more positive response than before, with support for the President's policies being 100 to 1. Therefore, the President is extremely pleased with this feedback. However, it is rumored that the Axis powers are very angry after hearing the speech, and that Hitler will respond. The President did not comment on this. Yesterday, after the President delivered his speech on aiding China and Britain, he immediately took action, inviting the Chairman of the British Purchasing Commission, Purvis, to a meeting at the White House. U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau also attended. (Reuters, 31st)

New York: "The New York Times" stated that the absolute majority of the American people unanimously agree with the key point in President Roosevelt's speech that "an Axis victory would create a terrible era." "The New York Bulletin" stated that this speech is the highest call for the people to rise up and take action. The President's purpose is to make the people aware of the truth of the situation. (Reuters, 31st)

New York: President Roosevelt's speech on Sunday evening was warmly welcomed by Britain and several Balkan countries, while the Axis countries only expressed anger. When the London press listened to President Roosevelt's speech, German planes were bombing various parts of London, causing huge fires. The London press stated, "Our purpose has been forged into steel by the great fire in London." According to reports from Athens, all of Greece welcomed President Roosevelt's challenge to the Axis powers and predicted that the Axis powers would eventually fail. The press in the capital of Southern Bulgaria even set an unprecedented precedent by publishing President Roosevelt's speech, which the Axis powers hated, prominently in the newspaper. However, the press and unofficial sources in Budapest said that the speech was insincere and contained many contradictions. Roman newspapers deleted large portions of President Roosevelt's speech and published it on pages two and three in an insignificant position. The authoritative "Messaggero" did not publish a single word about Roosevelt's speech. Italian political circles generally said that this kind of third-country opposition to the Axis's position would not cause them to panic. "Il Popolo di Roma" recognized that the United States had become an ally of Britain. "Il Giornale d'Italia" editor-in-chief, Gaeta, wrote that Roosevelt had united with Britain and had launched an undeclared war against the Axis powers and Japan. "The Axis powers have been patient for a long time, but it must be known that the patience of the Axis powers is limited." As for the general public in Moscow, they have not yet learned of Roosevelt's speech through the press or radio. In Sofia, Bulgarian authorities said that the scope of President Roosevelt's speech was far beyond people's expectations. In Vichy, the Havas news agency disseminated a summary of President Roosevelt's speech at 4:00 PM, deleting everything in the speech that involved the Axis powers and Japan. The conclusion of the Havas telegram stated that the spirit of President Roosevelt's speech has far exceeded the usual limits and will inevitably arouse enthusiastic comments around the world. (Havas, 31st)

Berlin: Unofficial but highly reliable sources in Germany now know that Hitler will directly respond to Roosevelt's speech within days. However, it is not yet clear whether his response will be in the form of a speech by Hitler himself or through someone authorized to speak on his behalf. Before the announcement of this declaration, the sources stated, "We are under orders not to express any opinions." It is known that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is personally studying Roosevelt's speech. Yesterday, Berlin newspapers not only did not publish Roosevelt's speech, but also did not publish any news about the U.S. President's upcoming speech. The major newspapers will criticize it after the German government responds. (Associated Press, 31st)

Rome: "Il Giornale d'Italia" stated that Roosevelt believes that the Americas are harmed by the Axis powers. In fact, the Axis powers have tolerated them to this day, but tolerance has its limits. This war aims to liberate Europe from British rule. Britain cannot win, and U.S. aid is just a futile waste and will only bring disaster upon itself. (Reuters, 31st)

### Hitler Issues New Year's Address to Soldiers; Army and Navy Leaders Offer Congratulations

Berlin: German Head of State and Supreme Commander of the German Armed Forces, Hitler, recently issued a New Year's address to the German soldiers, stating, "German soldiers, the army of the National Socialist Party of Greater Germany has achieved glorious victories in 1940. The enemy has suffered major defeats on land, sea, and air. All achievements have been accomplished by the brave soldiers of each army. I am deeply moved. Your combat spirit has accomplished such great achievements in a matter of months, washing away the humiliation we suffered in the forest of Compiègne. It will be immortalized in history. I now, in my capacity as Supreme Commander and on behalf of the people of the entire country, thank you. We will commemorate the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country and the brave soldiers of Fascist Italy equally. At the beginning of this new year, I respectfully wish the army of the National Socialist Party of Greater Germany to accomplish the greatest victory in our country's history in 1941."

At the same time, the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force also issued New Year's greetings. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)

Berlin: Commander of the German Stormtroopers and Chief of Police Himmler today issued a New Year's address to the soldiers, declaring, "To all officers and soldiers of the Stormtroopers and the Police, our goals for action in 1941 are threefold: (1) Loyalty to the country, (2) Determination to win, (3) Faith in the Führer."

### Japanese to Receive Diplomatic Corps on New Year's Day

Vichy: According to well-informed sources here, French Head of State Marshal Pétain is scheduled to receive the diplomatic corps tomorrow. At that time, the Papal Nuncio will lead the New Year's greetings to Marshal Pétain. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)

Lisbon: The newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to Vichy, Admiral Leahy, has arrived here aboard the cruiser "Tuscaloosa". Leahy does not intend to stay in Portugal and will proceed to France as soon as possible to present his credentials. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)

### French Army Chief Issues Message to Comrades

Vichy: Army Minister General Huntziger recently issued a message to all soldiers across the country on the occasion of the New Year. The message read, "1940 was truly one of the most tragic years. Now that the end of the year has arrived, I am deeply concerned for all my comrades. However, I must first offer my best wishes for the New Year to those who are prisoners of war, those who are detained abroad for the country, and their families. I then offer my best wishes to those who are far away in overseas territories, defending the integrity of the empire, and those who are unable to return home for the holidays due to official duties. Finally, I offer my congratulations to all soldiers and their families in the country. I deeply hope that as a result of our efforts, the new France will achieve something." (Havas, 30th)

### German Planes Madly Attack Britain, London Suffers Terrible Devastation; Fires Still Burning, Walls and Ruins Everywhere; Many Famous Ancient Churches Damaged

London: On Saturday night and Monday morning, the British Air Force bombed Frankfurt, and military targets in the area suffered heavy bombing. However, the results are unknown. (Associated Press, 31st)

London: On Sunday night, the city of London was heavily attacked by enemy planes, and dozens of houses caught fire and were completely destroyed. Yesterday, firefighters worked all day without stopping, clearing rubble and embers. It was found that there were no military targets within a mile of the bombed area. The major fires that broke out after the bombing were extinguished after an all-night effort, but some houses were completely burned inside, leaving only shells, which were still smoking and emitting sparks. In the worst affected areas, fire hoses crisscrossed the streets, winding through alleys and courtyards to reach areas where the residual fire was not completely extinguished, spraying water. The number of famous churches in the city of London that have been damaged has previously reached six, and now St. Anne's Church on Gresham Street, St. Agnes Church, and St. Mary's Church on Lombard Street have all been damaged. Another famous building, the Dr. Johnson Memorial Hall in Gough Square on Fleet Street (where Dr. Johnson compiled his famous English dictionary), was also set on fire by the bombing, but the chair that the doctor often sat in and valuable first editions of the dictionary were rescued. Other buildings such as the London Central Criminal Court, the City Hall, and the music school were also damaged. Houses in the Cheapside area were destroyed by fire, leaving only dangerous walls. The same was true of St. Bride's Church, where only the spire still towered high. The beautiful interior architecture of the church was the best in the city, but despite efforts to save it, it could not escape devastation. All the woodwork was reduced to ashes, and large pieces of glass were melted. The roof also collapsed, leaving only a pile of rubble. The City Hall auditorium also caught fire, and the roof was burned and collapsed. A fire broke out inside St. Mary's Church, and the embers were not extinguished. The above is part of the scene presented in London today after this severe night attack. The method used by the German planes in this attack was similar to the previous attack on Coventry, that is, first dropping incendiary bombs to start fires, and then using the firelight to find targets and drop high-explosive bombs. However, the German planes left before they could indiscriminately drop bombs, probably because the weather suddenly changed or because British fighter planes took off, and they did not dare to linger.

### British Planes Attack Naples at Night; Customs Wharf Hit; Red Light Illuminates the Sky

London: British bomber squadrons raided many military targets in German territory and various seaports and airfields in German-occupied areas on Sunday night. (Reuters, 31st)

Cairo: Naples, Italy's largest port, was heavily bombed by British planes on Sunday night. British planes first dropped bombs on customs buildings and wharves, and then distributed leaflets. The leaflets contained Churchill's speech criticizing Mussolini for harming the country and the people. According to a British Air Force bulletin, when British planes flew away from Naples, they saw the west end of the customs wharf on fire, illuminating the sky in a red glow. The extent of the damage there could not be seen in detail due to weather conditions. All the planes that participated in the attack returned safely. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)

### British Prime Minister Churchill Inspects Disaster Area

London: There were no German air raids anywhere in Britain last night. An Aviation Ministry bulletin simply stated "nothing to report." After the German planes bombed London on Sunday night, the British King sent a telegram to the city's mayor to express his condolences. Prime Minister Churchill also personally visited the bombed areas yesterday to inspect the damage. It is said that the damage suffered by the public halls was beyond general expectations. Six of London's oldest churches were either destroyed or heavily damaged. (Reuters, 31st)

### Rumors of Japanese Navy's Southern Advance Pending; U.S. Will Not Abandon Dutch East Indies; Willing to Use Force

Hong Kong: Rumors are rampant that the Japanese army will soon advance south or is preparing for a southern advance, but there is no factual proof. Concerned people have investigated this point and feel that the Japanese army has no such plan at present. There are currently 25,000 Japanese troops in Vietnam and 25,000 in Hainan Island. There has been no recent increase. According to military experts here, the Japanese navy is not preparing to advance south to seize the Dutch East Indies or Malaya, because if Japanese warships leave their territorial waters, they may be attacked by the U.S. fleet. According to reliable sources, if Japan launches a southern advance, the United States will go to war with Japan, because the United States wants to maintain the status quo in the Far East and wants to retain the resources of oil and rubber from the Dutch East Indies, because American synthetic rubber cannot replace natural rubber. The U.S. Navy believes that if the Japanese fleet remains within its territorial waters, like the Italian fleet, it will be difficult to attack and destroy. However, if it risks a southern advance, observers believe that the U.S. fleet can defeat it. Observers pointed out that west of Hawaii, the U.S. Navy has no good base, but it can use supply ships to supplement warships and oil tankers to form a temporary surface base for relief. It is widely believed that although Germany is trying to incite a U.S.-Japan war to prevent the United States from aiding Britain, the British victories in Albania and North Africa are also one of the reasons why Japan has been hesitant to advance. Observers said that Japan is not preparing to fight the U.S. now. (International News Agency, 31st)

### U.S. to Build Naval and Air Bases on British Islands; Preliminary Survey Completed; Locations Also Determined

Washington: It is expected here that the U.S. Navy will soon begin construction of naval and air bases on the British territories leased from Britain. The locations for the bases to be built from Newfoundland to the British territories at the northern tip of South America have been determined, and the preliminary survey has also been completed. The locations of the bases to be built in each territory are listed below: (1) In Bermuda, Long Bird Island will be used as an airport, and St. David's Island will be used as a seaplane base, naval base, and garrison area. (2) In the Bahamas, Abrahams Bay and a small area of Mayaguana Island will be used as bases. (3) In Jamaica, Port Royal Bay, Goat Island, and nearby bays will be used to moor warships. (4) In Antigua, an area of Parham Sound and the Crabbes Peninsula east of Parham Harbour will be used as bases. (5) In St. Lucia, a seaplane base will be built on Gros Islet. (6) In British Guiana, an airfield will be built upstream of the Demerara River, and a seaplane base will be built near Suddie on the Essequibo River. (7) In Newfoundland, an airfield and army training camp will be established on the Argentia Peninsula, a naval base will be built in St. John's Harbour, and the army will be stationed and fortified north of Quidi Vidi Lake.

### Rumors of German Peace Proposals to U.S.; State Department Does Not Deny; Formalities Not Worth Attention

Washington: It is rumored that Germany made a peace proposal in October of this year, requesting President Roosevelt to act as a mediator. Yesterday, Marshall, chairman of the America First Committee, questioned the State Department, demanding that the U.S. release the proposal it received. The State Department did not deny that the peace proposal had been made, but said that regarding these formalities, there was "nothing" worthy of attention. Marshall said that the proposal was submitted to the government by New York oil magnate Davis. The State Department responded, "The government can only handle important international events through legitimate and responsible agencies." (International News Agency, 31st)

### New Year's Greetings and Looking Back at Shanghai

— Wu Kaixian

On this commemorative founding anniversary of the Republic of China, while looking forward to the future, looking back at Shanghai fills me with boundless excitement:

First, this year marks the 30th anniversary of the Republic of China. In ancient times, people regarded thirty years as one generation, and they attached great importance to the number "thirty." The growth of an individual is indeed similar to the development of a country. Confucius said: "At fifteen, I set my heart on learning; at thirty, I stood firm." In this word "firm," He Yan's Collected Explanations says that it means "having something established," and Zhu Xi's Commentary says that it means "having something to stand on one's own." The general meaning is the same. A person in society should truly "have something to stand on one's own" when they reach the age of thirty. The same is true for a country. Confucius said, "If there is a king, he must have a generation before benevolence is achieved." This means that "if there is one who receives the mandate of heaven and rules the world, it will take thirty years before benevolent government is achieved." The so-called "at thirty, stood firm," and the so-called "must have a generation before benevolence," these all coincide with the meaning that we must complete the policy of national construction in this year, the 30th anniversary of the Republic of China. What we call the policy of national construction would be simply called "building the government" in ancient times. Completing the policy of national construction is what the ancients hoped for: benevolence after a generation. Only by completing the policy of national construction can our country stand on its own in the international community. On this New Year's Day of our thirtieth year, everyone should encourage themselves with this in mind.

Second, I have studied and worked in Shanghai for more than twenty years. Shanghai is truly my second hometown. I returned to Shanghai once in the autumn of the year before last. The dire environment of Shanghai was what I saw with my own eyes and experienced personally. The perseverance and hard struggle of the Shanghai compatriots, gritting their teeth and struggling to overcome the difficulties, was what I saw with my own eyes and what I admired most from the bottom of my heart. This was still the situation a year ago. I imagine that the current environment is even worse than it was a year ago, and the spirit of perseverance and hard struggle of our compatriots is certainly even more admirable than it was a year ago. Although my body is in the provisional capital, my eyes are always looking back at Shanghai, and our hearts are always concerned about the hard struggle of our compatriots and friends in Shanghai. I should take this auspicious occasion of the National Day to express my personal concern and admiration.

Third, although the past environment in Shanghai was dire, it will likely become even more difficult in the coming months. Although all commercial interests of third countries in Shanghai will be hit in the future, at the same time, the economic lives of five million citizens will also feel the threat. However, the foundation of Chinese legal tender is solid and cannot be shaken by any attempt. I sincerely hope that the Shanghai compatriots can take the overall situation into consideration, endure the pain of one corner and one moment, and remember the saying that after suffering comes sweetness.

Fourth, China has now reached the 30th year and has indeed reached the period of "at thirty, stood firm" and should have something established. After three and a half years of struggle, we have already reaped satisfactory results. In the current European situation, although it is a war in another region and another camp, and the evolution of the events has its own internal and international contradictions and fundamental factors, the awakening of ambition has not been inspired by the Far East. Since the signing of the Tripartite Pact, the two major wars in the East and West have merged in form. Although Japan's attempt to advance south is preparing step by step, in reality, it is still hesitating. The reason for this is, on the one hand, due to the strong attitude of the United States, but the continued fighting of China is the main determining force. Because of this, the increasingly powerful China has become the true stabilizing force in the Far East and has won international sympathy and assistance. The loan of 100 million US dollars from the United States and 10 million pounds from the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union's statement by Ambassador Smetanin in Japan that "there is still no change in the policy towards China," and the signing of a new trade agreement with China, all of this is not accidental, but the result of our resolute struggle.

Now we are stepping into the great 30th year of the Republic of China, and the history of national resistance has opened a new page. Whether in the military, political, or diplomatic aspects, we are clearly in a proactive position. The freedom and independence of China is related to the survival and happiness of our nation for thousands of years to come, and at the same time, it is also related to the reconstruction of world peace and human civilization. Our responsibility is exceptionally great, and our current work is particularly difficult. At this moment before the arrival of national liberation, all compatriots across the country must recognize that individuals only have freedom when the nation has freedom, and that the interests of the country are higher than private interests. They must also endure pain, have firm faith, and work together under the grand goal of resisting and building, to complete the mission of national liberation.

On this auspicious day of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, looking forward to the future and looking back at Shanghai, I am filled with boundless excitement. Therefore, I honestly and frankly list the above four points as a token of my admiration and blessings for the New Year. I also hope that everyone will do their best to overcome the difficulties, break away from the predicament, and regain the light. The day is not far off.

### Wheat Shortage in China and Japan

Washington: The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced yesterday that although wheat production in Manchuria, China, and Japan was higher than last year, there is now a panic over a wheat shortage. The U.S. Department of Agriculture explained that the reasons for the wheat shortage are the interference of officials in transferring wheat from surplus areas to areas with poor harvests, the disruption of transportation, and the gradual increase in the replacement of rice with wheat. The news also stated that under the current circumstances, it seems impossible to import large quantities of foreign wheat. (International News Agency, 31st)

### Japanese Cabinet Decides to Reform Civil Service System

Tokyo: The plan to reform the Japanese civil service system decided by the Konoe Cabinet, after the public demanded changes and the elimination of inefficiency, was approved today by the Privy Council convened in the Imperial Presence. According to a statement issued by Information Bureau Director Ito, this is evidence that the New Order has deeply penetrated all levels of Japanese civil service personnel. The approval of this plan will go a long way towards the most effective personnel management and the establishment of the highest degree of national defense. This is truly a historic achievement in the 2,600th year of the founding of the Japanese Empire. (Reuters, 31st)

### Kong Xiangxi Reports on the State of Governance Over the Past Year - This Year Will Be the Year of Victory in Resistance and Construction

Chongqing. The Central Government held the last weekly memorial service of the year on the 30th morning, where Vice President Kong attended and reported on the state of governance over the past year. The main points are recorded as follows: Chairman, comrades, today is the last weekly memorial service for Premier Sun Yat-sen in the 29th year of the Republic of China. I am here to report on my duties. I would like to take this opportunity of the changing year to report on some important matters of our resistance and construction in the past year, as a reference for learning from the past and looking to the future. I ask all comrades to give guidance. The past year has been the most breathtaking year in human history and a turning point in the safety and well-being of our Chinese nation. International winds and clouds have changed, like the transformation of the sea. On this day last year, many countries that enjoyed peace and happiness are now suffering the most tragic encounters of mankind. All old international order, political ideals, economic construction, and even people's thoughts, beliefs, and lifestyles are under serious threat and may be forcibly changed. Some small countries in Europe, who usually lived in peace with their neighbors, with their countries bustling with people and peaceful, are now being conquered. The conspiracy and hatred of those who would destroy countries are truly chilling. In this turbulent storm, our Chinese nation, fortunately, relied on the spirit of the Premier in heaven, secret blessings, and the leadership of the leader, and the cooperation of the whole country, to finally turn danger into safety, turn defeat into victory, break through numerous difficulties, and lay the foundation for victory. Compared with the current situation of resistance and construction and the situation on this day last year, we have made significant progress and have definite confidence in military, diplomatic, political, economic, and financial terms. According to the current situation, the 30th year of the Republic of China will be the year when the War of Resistance will be closer to victory, which is undoubtedly certain.

In the military, stability has been maintained throughout the year. Although there were slight advances and retreats in the Battle of Central Hubei, the scope of the Japanese activities could not escape our army's control. The great victory in Northern Hubei last month allowed the remaining Japanese forces in Yisha to fall into a dangerous situation. The unprecedented victory in Suiyuan and the repeated annihilation of Japanese troops in Southern Shanxi showed that the Japanese had exhausted all their efforts to invade Southern Guangxi last year, but eventually withdrew in October of this year due to our severe pressure. The gains and losses show the Japanese army's weakness and their awkward state of being unable to attend to both ends. This is very different from the situation at the beginning of the War of Resistance.

In terms of diplomacy, the most memorable thing for us is the closure and opening of the Southwest International Transportation Route, the establishment of the alliance between the three countries, and the signing of the Japan-German-Italy Pact. Although the process of these events was very tortuous, the final evolution has finally brought us great benefits. The German blitzkrieg crushed France and Poland and occupied the Netherlands and Belgium. In a few months, most of Europe changed dramatically. The British Isles were under heavy threat. The Japanese took this opportunity to use tricks to lure various countries, "hoping to achieve their goal of taking advantage of the situation." Our government has always adhered to a firm stance and responded to any incidents. Unexpected pressure is not enough to affect our national policy of resistance and construction. However, the possible development of the international situation at that time was indeed the focus of national anxiety. The transportation on the Yunnan-Burma Road was announced to be closed in this dim atmosphere. The depression in the spirit of the people was also unavoidable. It was not until the announcement of the establishment of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance that peace-loving people all over the world realized the endless ambition of the Japanese and knew that our War of Resistance had a significant contribution to the overall situation in East Asia and world peace. Therefore, international public opinion changed overnight. The Yunnan-Burma Road was reopened. British and American loans to us were successively established. The military supplies that the Japanese relied on from the United States were repeatedly restricted from being exported. This urgent change was like seeing the sun through the clouds, making the light of justice reappear in the international community. The alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan and the pact signed by the Japanese were regarded by the Japanese as the supreme treasure, but in fact, they were counterproductive and accelerated their collapse. Right and wrong, smoothness and adversity are very clear. The future of China's War of Resistance has been given a more favorable situation.

In terms of general administration, the government is promoting resistance and construction simultaneously. The gradual implementation of the new county system is the foundation for completing the national revolution in the past year in internal affairs. In order to establish a long-term foundation for national governance and security, the central government has provided subsidies to promote the realization of the new county system and has allocated 30% of the stamp tax revenue for local application. Furthermore, in view of the improvement of national education levels and economic life, for the long-term plan of national construction, we have made continuous efforts to promote production in the rear and popularize national education. In the spring and summer of this year, the Executive Yuan organized a political inspection team, selecting senior officials to go to various provinces to investigate the situation of governance and visit the hardships of the people. Summarizing the results of the inspection, during the War of Resistance, the general local politics of various provinces have improved. This has a positive impact on stabilizing the rear and promoting construction. It can also be seen that the opportunity for national restoration and construction has also been initiated with the war.

Economic warfare is the main factor determining the victory or defeat of the War of Resistance and is the focus of attention of the people of the country. It is true that the longer the war lasts, the more important the economic issues become. This is a very common and natural trend in modern warfare. However, some people do not understand this principle, and because they see that from the president to the government officials at all levels, they are paying attention to this issue, they think that there is some special crisis in the current economic situation of our country, and they misunderstand each other, causing a kind of psychological panic. This is because they do not understand the basic principles of modern warfare and its natural trends. We do not deny that China currently has an important economic problem that needs to be resolved with the greatest determination and perseverance. However, this does not mean that our economic society is now encountering a serious crisis. This is something that the people of the country must deeply understand.

Among the current economic problems, commodity prices occupy the core of the problem. If there are some people who do not understand modern economics, they will have various questions and speculate in surprise. They do not know that commodity prices have always occupied a central position in modern economics, especially during wartime. The government and the people have recently used all their strength to solve the price problem for this reason. If the price problem is grasped, other problems can also be solved easily. This is something that people with modern economic common sense can certainly understand and can no longer be repeated. However, modern economic problems are very complex and have related relationships with all aspects of the entire society. This also means that the price problem is not a simple problem, and it is even more difficult to solve it with a simple formula. We need to plan comprehensively on the one hand, taking into account all the factors, and on the other hand, we must assess the current financial and human resources situation, make appropriate arrangements, distinguish priorities, and proceed step by step, and at the moment, military and diplomatic affairs cannot be affected in the slightest. Otherwise, the entire War of Resistance will be affected. In the past few years, the government has been working hard in accordance with this policy, and it has been even more active in the past six months. In order to enable the economic institutions to operate flexibly and connect with each other, the Executive Yuan has recently established an Economic Conference, which meets once a week, and holds a meeting report once a month. It has also established a Department of Material Supervision in the Executive Yuan in accordance with the resolutions of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee, which is responsible for economic and administrative affairs during the War of Resistance, so that the strength is concentrated and the power is unified. It is hoped that it will be formally established soon. In the past few months, because of the high prices of grain, which has greatly affected the people's lives, a National Grain Administration has been established in the Executive Yuan to control the country's grain. Grain management agencies have also been added to the provincial and county governments, using the power of the government to seek reasonable production and sales of grain in order to stabilize its price. The competent authorities are also seeking fair prices for other necessities of life in order to enrich the people's livelihood. These are the facilities in the political institutions in recent years. Concrete measures to address the grain problem have now been set and distributed to the country for implementation. Among the short-term measures, the most important thing is to strive for smooth grain sources, and to prevent counties from blocking grain exports and absorbing surplus grain from various places to supply the market, in order to achieve smooth flow of goods. The long-term solution is to increase production, dredge the source, and restrict people from storing more surplus grain based on the production and consumption of various places, and strictly crack down on hoarding of essential goods. On the one hand, they are punished according to law, and on the other hand, they adopt the policy of simultaneous price parity of grain prices, commodity prices, and labor prices, and regular price suppression. The government also allocates huge sums of money to purchase and transport separately for sale at parity prices to supply the market. Since the implementation of these measures, considerable results have been received. When the long-term solution is implemented smoothly, the price problem can be gradually solved. (To be continued) (Broadcast on the 31st)

All students who are admitted, have good character and academics, and whose families are indeed impoverished can apply in accordance with the regulations. Most of the school's main teachers and staff are graduates of well-known Christian universities in Shanghai and have the hard-working spirit of general Christian middle schools. However, the school life is serious and there is no aristocratic atmosphere. The school's winter vacation enrollment is scheduled for the 22nd of this month, and there are still vacancies in each class.

### The Whole City Celebrates Joyfully, Welcoming the New Year of Victory, The New Year and New Hopes Arrive Simultaneously, Supporting the National Policy of Resistance and Construction with Increased Faith

Today is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China and also the New Year's Day of the 30th year. All sectors of the city decided to follow the central government's order not to hold extravagant celebrations because it is an extraordinary time and the national crisis is still in progress. Commemorative ceremonies were held separately. All agencies, organizations, schools, and companies are closed for three days. The authorities of the two concessions implemented ordinary precautions for three days to ensure safety. The Shanghai Chinese National Unity Alliance issued a letter to all citizens of the city on New Year's Day of the 30th year. The original text is recorded as follows:

Completing the Great Cause is in This Year

Today is the New Year's Day of the 30th year of our Republic of China. With the beginning of this 30th year, our Chinese nation is embarking on a bright road. Confucius said, "At thirty, I stood firm," which is exactly the symbol of the revival of our Chinese nation. The lessons that history has shown us cannot be forgotten. In the past hundred years, the wounds and shackles suffered by our nation have been too much accumulated. Not only have we lost our national spirit, but we have also lost our freedom and peace. However, the sound of the artillery of the July 7th Incident awakened the soul of our Chinese nation, and with the irrigation of fresh red blood, the vitality of our national revival has also grown and developed. The New Year brings new hopes. We have new strength, fully prepared, waiting for the opportunity to strive forward and restore our homeland. Therefore, this year is the year of victory. This is the new hope of the New Year. We must all be prepared to welcome the arrival of this year of new hope. Dear compatriots, our more than three years of depression on the isolated island is something we should be proud of. In order to complete the great cause of national resistance and construction, and to seek national freedom and equality, we have built a mountain of nine ren. In the future, we should bite our teeth, and go further on the hundred-foot pole, that is, to complete our greatest task and realize our new hopes.

Hanging Flags to Celebrate, Enthusiasm

Today is the New Year's Day of the 30th year, which is also the year of victory in the general counter-offensive. Although all sectors of the city are in a special environment, they are enthusiastically hanging flags to celebrate this New Year's Day of great significance, and are even more determined to adhere to the belief in resistance and construction, support the national policy of resistance and construction, and actively promote the movement of thrift and construction to save the disaster and the movement of conscience contribution, in order to welcome the early arrival of the year of victory, so that the great cause of national construction and revival can be completed as soon as possible.

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek Tells American Friends: Victory is Coming Soon; Rapid Progress Achieved in Western China; Transformed Anew Amidst Painful Hardship

1941 is China's year of victory. Our country has been fighting with all its strength for more than three years, and now the international situation is becoming increasingly favorable, and the nation's future is becoming brighter. At the beginning of this new year, boundless hope suddenly arises. The people of the isolated islands should take this as a starting point for vigorous self-reflection. While extending celebrations together, they should strengthen their determination to serve the country. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Song Meiling, recently wrote to her American friends, describing the growth and development of our country in difficult circumstances. Her vivid descriptions serve as a profound warning to us. The translation of her original letter is as follows:

Free China Actively Engaged in Construction

The old year has passed and the new year has come. Although the situation we are in is quite dire, we have achieved great victories in the midst of difficulties. Because China has transformed anew in the midst of suffering. It is undeniable that the morale of the people is high and that their will is firm and difficult to shake. Without witnessing the perseverance of the people of Free China and observing the rapid progress of Western China, one cannot have a correct estimate of China's fighting power. In this vast area, a new China is being actively built. The development of industry and practical efforts keep China alive, vigorous, hopeful, and resolutely determined. All of this is amazing.

Extraordinary Spirit, Vibrant Vitality

However, not only this, but the strong character of the Chinese people, the diligence of individuals, and the manifestation of extraordinary spirit give China a vibrant vitality. Their calm attitude, appropriate management, and strong confidence are also inspiring and uplifting. The great changes in Western China are hard to imagine. Roads connect various places, making transportation extremely convenient. The construction of railways is advancing rapidly. This is not only conducive to the import of foreign raw materials and military supplies, but also eliminates jealousy and separation between some remote provinces in the Southwest, leading to cooperation. With such integration of provinces, increased administrative efficiency, peace, and tranquility, progress will inevitably be astonishing.

The Giant Wheel of Industry Moves Forward Unceasingly

The promotion of the New Life Movement encourages people to strive to be valuable citizens, improve family environments, trust and help each other, and pay attention to hygiene. Women's industrial cooperatives are also established everywhere, all working diligently to improve individuals and promote the progress and prosperity of the country. In addition to rural industries that have arisen due to the encouragement of cooperative undertakings by the New Life Movement, large-scale industrial cooperation movements are also being actively promoted. This will surely drive the giant wheel of industry, making it move forward unceasingly. Workers everywhere cooperate enthusiastically. Cooperatives spring up like mushrooms after rain, being established in Free China and spreading to other places. Their products are mostly made from local raw materials and sell well with great demand.

Women Everywhere Mobilized in Unison

They are fully utilized in coal mining, gold refining, shipbuilding, leather making, weaving, sugar refining, vehicle manufacturing, soap making, and food production, machine factories, iron smelting plants, and lumber yards, etc. Women everywhere are also mobilized to go to the front and rear, serving the military and civilians, teaching the people to reform bad habits, implement the New Life Movement and new ideas, with the aim of improving the situation in various rural areas. Their enthusiasm for work is quite remarkable. In short, the day of our country's victory is not far off, but the responsibility is even more arduous than before. We should do our best to promote the construction of Free China and mobilize the vast and boundless manpower of the whole country. Regardless of East, West, North, or South, regardless of men, women, old, or young, we should work together to achieve independence and liberation.

### Female Writer Visits Shanghai: Soviet Aid to China is Determined and Unwavering; Harmonious Relations Among Authorities in the Capital

American writer Ms. Snow, author of numerous works on China and the Soviet Union, most of which are best-selling books in the United States, has a strong reputation. Recently returned to the US after travels to the Soviet Union and Chongqing, she passed through Shanghai yesterday and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the President Coolidge at 2:00 AM today. When she will return to China is unknown, but Ms. Snow indicated to friends that she was reluctant to leave. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Ms. Snow at her residence yesterday. According to her, the Soviet Union is determined to continue aiding China and will not sign any treaties with Japan. When Ms. Snow was in Chongqing, she spoke with General Chiang Kai-shek, General Bai Chongxi, and CCP leader Zhou Enlai. She deeply feels that the Chinese communists all support General Chiang Kai-shek. When Ms. Snow discussed rumors of conflict between the Nationalists and Communists, she said that this matter arose because the Eighth Route Army and Fourth Route Army were ordered to be transferred north of the Yellow River, but she insisted that the leaders of both parties she met in the capital believed that this matter would be resolved satisfactorily. Ms. Snow said that she stayed in the capital for three weeks and deeply understands that the spirit of cooperation among the Nationalist and Communist leaders cannot be alienated by rumors and conspiracies.

### Group Leader Xie of the Lone Army Camp Encourages Youth

Xie Jinyuan, the leader of the lone army camp, issued a letter to the youth of the isolated island for the new year, encouraging the youth to strengthen our confidence in "certain victory" and "certain success," hold our heads high, stride forward, firmly stand our ground with resolute will, and, at any time and place, directly or indirectly, for the country and the nation, be down-to-earth, pragmatic, and do as much as we can with our strength, save every penny, and increase the country's strength by one point. Currently, the first to donate money are overseas Chinese, even a coolie, a cart driver, each person can donate their daily wages regularly on a monthly basis and send them back to their motherland continuously. This kind of example of serving the country can serve as a model for us to glorify our ancestors. We must understand that our strength lies in the extensive and subtle exertion of effort. This most basic, most practical, and easiest patriotic movement should not be taken lightly or considered too troublesome because the matter is trivial, or started but not finished. Young people, with a firm belief in "certain victory" and "certain success," move forward together on the great and bright path to national rejuvenation. Arise, everyone, and shoulder the sacred task that cannot be shirked, and jointly follow the leader's New Year's Day message: "The military and civilians of the whole country work together to welcome our year of victory."

### Beggar Shelter Begins Admitting; Must Be Sent by the Bureau; Others Not Accepted

The beggar shelter entrusted by the Public Works Department and Rotary Club to the Salvation Army has now been fully completed. The Salvation Army held an opening ceremony at the shelter on Hart Road and Singapore Road at 2:30 PM yesterday. Over a hundred people, including officials from the British and American consulates and the Public Works Department, attended. The district chief, Ma Ruishan, gave a speech, Pastor Ba Waner prayed, and the chairman of the Public Works Department, Kai Ziwei, presided over the flag-raising ceremony and gave a speech. Afterwards, Ma Ruishan led a tour, and the mood was quite enthusiastic. The shelter is scheduled to start admitting people today, fifty people per day, and will be able to accommodate them all within a month. The beggars to be accommodated must be sent by the Public Works Department. Those introduced by others or those who come on their own will not be accepted, in order to prevent abuses.

### What Should the People of Shanghai Do?

— Zhuang Fu

On the eve of a major historical transformation, in today's exchange of Far Eastern war and European turmoil, the importance of our country's sacred task of resistance and construction is becoming increasingly clear. Because our fighting is not only for our own independence and survival, but also for world peace and justice. Although its goal is to seek liberation for ourselves, its results affect the future of mankind.

For the past three and a half years, our strength has grown stronger as we fight. Militarily, politically, and diplomatically, we are in an active position with a leaping posture. The political offensive of the other side has been shattered by our great national spirit, and military aggression has also fallen into a fragile and powerless state on the verge of collapse. Diplomatic and economic situations are even more thorny, like a fire consuming itself. In a situation where they are at a loss, they have to use the Wang Jingwei conditions to carry out self-anesthesia, and use it to perfunctorily deal with the domestic masses. The objective situation has proven that our country has the hope of light, while the other side is declining like the setting sun.

The New Year's Day of the 30th year of the Republic of China is undoubtedly the revelation of the dawn of final victory. This year will be a new stage for us to launch a general counter-offensive and obtain national freedom and independence. However, in the occupied areas, especially on the misty and confusing isolated island, the moment before the light must be more difficult, darker, and more dangerous. As long as we can firmly believe in resistance and construction, endure temporary pain, and break through the darkness, the road ahead will be the road to happiness.

It must be known that they are trying to attack our military strength, and at the same time, they are also trying to attack our revolutionary spirit. If our spirit cannot be invigorated and our will cannot be concentrated, then wartime life will inevitably fall into being content with the status quo or being selfish and self-serving, or even falling into a pre-set trap. As the saying goes, "Once a chain is put on, it cannot be untied for hundreds of generations. Once the spirit is subdued, it will sink into eternal damnation." This is what the Chinese masses should be vigilant about in welcoming the year of victory.

Therefore, what we should practice at present is:

First, production and construction are an important part of national economic construction, and also a major prerequisite for enriching combat strength. Due to the increase in population during the war in this city, the influx of idle capital, and the dangerous environment, legitimate businesses cannot develop. As a result, speculators take advantage of it to hunt for illegitimate profits. Illegally engaging in private interests is no different from assisting Japan. Hoarding and manipulating prices often affect people's livelihoods, ignore the survival of the country, and seek personal greed. Even if conscience does not blame them, national law will ultimately not tolerate them. Moreover, the crisis on the isolated island is just beginning to develop. Instead of waiting for immeasurable losses, it is better to move capital to the mainland, engage in production and construction, so as to achieve a state where there are no wasted people, wasted time, wasted land, and wasted materials, and promote the rapid arrival of final victory.

Second, schools are the gardens for cultivating revolutionary youth, and at the same time, they are the fortresses for developing Chinese culture. The responsibilities of the education sector are more important than those of other sectors, and it is more difficult to cope with the harsh environment than others. However, since we have a deep understanding of righteousness in favorable and adverse situations, and we have a firm belief in the national policy of resisting aggression and building the country, we will not be shaken by threats, inducements, or slight setbacks. The education sector must not only be loyal and unwavering to the country and the nation and have a clear conscience, but also actively shoulder the mission of saving and building the country. Even if it is subjected to the oppression of dark forces and cannot maintain the status quo, it should insist on the spirit of non-compromise and fight to the end. The youth of the city will surely follow the teachers to eradicate the spread of toxic education. Moreover, the relevant authorities are already planning remedial measures and will not ignore the lives of colleagues in the education sector.

Third, last year, due to the tightening of control and the hoarding and profiteering of unscrupulous merchants, prices were high and life was increasingly difficult. As a result, labor disputes arose one after another and were particularly serious. The reason for this is mostly driven by livelihood issues, but there are also traces of villains taking advantage of the situation to incite trouble, hoping to generate a political offensive. We deeply hope that at this moment before dawn, we should promote the spirit of labor-management mutual assistance. The capital side must find ways to improve the lives of workers in the face of rising prices, and at the same time, the labor side should not resort to strikes as a last resort in order to overcome this final difficulty. It must be known that the current difficulties and hardships are caused by the forces of aggression. Only when China gains true freedom and independence will the day come for our compatriots in this city to be reborn. Otherwise, both labor and management will perish due to the increasingly dangerous environment. This is something that must be paid attention to.

The above three points are the minimum hopes for this New Year's Day and the necessary conditions for striving for national liberation. After three and a half years of hard fighting and the recent development of the situation, China is confident that it will win the final victory, and the day of victory is not far off. The key to victory is now in the hands of every compatriot.

### The "District Chief" of Sijing Town Tramples on the Local People

Cao Jiancai, the "district chief" of Sijing Town, was imprisoned for forging documents before the National Army withdrew to the west. When the area fell, he was released with the crowd. In March of this year, he was appointed as the "district chief" of Sijing during the tenure of the former "Songjiang County Chief" Zhang Shouzhi. After taking office, he increased the arbitrary taxes and levies by more than threefold. It is said that more than 4,000 yuan for the construction of streets was embezzled, which is truly shocking.

### After External Negotiations Regarding Goods Held Up in Vietnam, the Vietnamese Governor Has Agreed Not to Auction Them; Negotiations on Returning Them to Shanghai and Hong Kong are Underway

Regarding the goods of Chinese merchants in Shanghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou that were transported via the joint transportation system but were held up in Vietnam, after the Vietnamese governor ordered that they not be allowed to be returned to Hong Kong and Shanghai, and proposed to auction them, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and various industries cabled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to fight for their release, and sent representative Jiang Chengdong to Saigon to negotiate with the Vietnamese governor for their release. Now that representative Jiang has returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with representative Jiang yesterday. The Vietnamese governor had ordered that the goods of Chinese merchants held up in Vietnam be auctioned, but the money from the auction would still be returned to the owners. After protests from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and efforts by the owners, the Vietnamese governor has agreed not to auction them. However, negotiations on returning them to Hong Kong and Shanghai are underway. The owners have joined forces with the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and other organizations to demand their release.

### Public Works Department Files Definitely Moved; Total of Twelve Boxes

The North-China Daily News reported that on Sunday evening (the 29th), twelve boxes of files from the Shanghai Municipal Government's Public Works Department at No. 172 Qiqi Road had been taken away by the Japanese and would probably be handed over to the "Municipal Government." An official of the French Concession police did not confirm or deny this, only saying that he had also heard that there was a dispute at the intersection of Qiqi Road and Fuli Road at 7:00 PM on Sunday afternoon. According to a Chinese report, the French police sent officers to the scene, but it was too late. The Japanese had already loaded the wooden boxes onto a car and driven away.

### Xue Gengxin Has Been Promoted to Chief Inspector

Xue Gengxin, inspector of the French Concession police's political department, and translator Zou Chengding are deeply valued by the police department authorities for their diligence and outstanding work. It is learned that Xue has now been promoted to chief inspector, and Zou has been promoted to second-class inspector.

### Pudong Mercenaries Ding and Xu Clash; Ferry Service Suspended Yesterday

The Pudong mercenaries are fighting among themselves for territory, resulting in the suspension of ferry service from Puxi to Donggou and Gaoqiao yesterday morning. There are two people, Ding Xishan and Xu Hongfa, who, when the National Army withdrew to the west, acted as bandits in the name of guerrilla teams in Nanhui, Chuansha, and Fengxian in Pudong. Ding and Xu were then reorganized. Ding's force had about 3,000 people, and Xu's force had about 1,000 people, occupying the area under the jurisdiction of Chuansha County. Recently, Ding's force planned to annex Xu's force, but Xu's force refused, and disputes arose. Suddenly, the day before yesterday morning (the 30th) at dawn, Ding's force, in conjunction with the "police brigade," surrounded Xu's force in the Tangmu Bridge area of Chuansha County and carried out disarmament. The two sides immediately clashed, with dense gunfire from rifles and machine guns. The nearby people were greatly alarmed and fled in droves. The two sides were deadlocked for a day and night, and had not stopped as of yesterday morning, and the situation became more and more serious. The Japanese side then sent troops to the Gaoqiao Donggou area to defend, but did not interfere in the conflict between the two sides. Yesterday morning, in order to mobilize troops, the Japanese side completely requisitioned the ferries traveling between Shanghai Donggou, Gaoqiao, and Wusong for military use. Therefore, since yesterday morning, the people in that area have changed their routes to Pudong Lannidu and Dongchang Road and transferred to other routes. The ferry service from Puxi to Pudong is operating as usual. The outcome of the clash is currently unknown.

### Donation Campaign Should Guard Against Swindling

All sectors of the city have been very enthusiastic in supporting donation campaigns in the past, and the results have been very good. However, recently, there was a case of soliciting donations of 400,000 yuan of condolence funds to all sectors in the name of the Shanghai Municipal Consolation Money Fundraising Committee. After investigation by relevant parties, it was said that there was no such thing, and there is no such organization at present. The association is obviously an illegal organization with other attempts, and it has claimed to have organized Spring Festival Military Comfort, Friends of Wounded Soldiers, Air Force Comfort, Mid-Autumn Festival Military Comfort, and Winter Clothing Money, etc., which are not consistent with the facts. Moreover, its attached so-called Shanghai Municipal Fundraising Condolence Fund Regulations also have provisions for dispatching personnel to collect money, which is enough to prove that it is a swindle. It is said that the relevant authorities of the city have informed all sectors to pay attention.

### American Missionaries in Zhejiang Mostly Evacuated; Elderly Pastor Hutcherson Also Returns Home on the Coolidge

The North-China Daily News reported that several Americans left Shanghai on the President Coolidge today (the 31st), and Reverend Hutcherson of the American Southern Presbyterian Church in Jiaxing, Zhejiang, was among them. With Hutcherson's departure, almost all American missionaries in Zhejiang have evacuated. Hutcherson has been writing correspondence for the North-China Daily News since 1898. At the age of 73, he is still quite healthy. Although he is over the retirement age, he has repeatedly received requests to stay in office due to his effective service. This time, Hutcherson's determination is firm. It is said that it is useless for American missionaries to stay here, because if the United States and Japan go to war, the missionaries' stay will not only involve the Chinese people, but also be a burden to the American government. At that time, the Japanese will imprison the missionaries in concentration camps, and the Chinese who have contact with the missionaries will also encounter the same fate. The American women and children serving in the 25 churches in the Jiaxing area have been completely evacuated, leaving only one or two men to guard them. Chinese pastors are still working, but schools and hospitals have been closed.

The Coolidge Sets Sail This Morning

The American President Lines' President Coolidge came from the United States to the Far East this time. Because American volunteer pilots were on board to assist China, it went directly to the Philippines via Kobe. Now it has returned from the Philippines and arrived in Hong Kong the day before yesterday (the 30th) at 2:30 PM, berthed at floating buoys 11 and 12. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The mail ship stayed in Shanghai for a day and night and set sail at 2:00 AM this morning, leaving Shanghai for Japan, passing through Xiangshan, San Francisco, and returning to Los Angeles. The ship this time carried many American expatriates evacuating from Southeast Asia and this city. The passenger seats were full. There were 37 first-class passengers, 40 second-class passengers, and 95 third-class passengers, totaling 172 people, coming from Little Luzon and Hong Kong to Shanghai. Those who passed through Shanghai and returned to the United States on the original ship included 230 first-class passengers, 42 second-class passengers, and 305 third-class passengers, totaling 577 people. About 300 people boarded the ship in Shanghai to return to the United States. More than 80 missionaries from various places were also on board.

### How China Can Wage a Long-Term War (1)

— Hu Shi

Mr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, gave a very moving speech at the third "Bowl of Rice" campaign banquet in New York, entitled "The Sympathy of the American People," the original text of which was published in this newspaper on December 16 last year. Yesterday, we received Ambassador Hu's manuscript "How China Can Wage a Long-Term War?" sent by airmail from the United States.

This is another masterpiece that analyzes the factors of the Far East War from a scholar's perspective. Undoubtedly, the Chinese nation has lived in one country, one government, one law, one script, one education system, and one historical culture for 2,100 years. In any nation or any history, there are no similar examples of a nation under this kind of unified life. Ambassador Hu uses the methods and perspectives of historical research to explain how the Chinese nation can wage a long-term war.

On the New Year's Day of welcoming the year of victory, we publish this masterpiece, which may be worth savoring by readers!

The war of China's resistance against Japanese aggression has a history of exactly forty months as of the weekend of the first week of November 1940. China has been fighting for three years and four months.

This war, for a peaceful nation like China, which was unprepared beforehand, is a very difficult war, which I don't need to explain, I think you will know. You know that China has lost many important territories and countless lives. You know that the Japanese have almost completely controlled our skies and seas, as well as important railway lines and waterways. You know that almost all of our trade, industry, education, and cultural centers, from Peiping to Xuzhou, from Shanghai to Yichang, have been ravaged or occupied by the invaders.

You know that almost all of our famous universities and colleges have been relocated to the interior. They mostly have no books, no laboratory equipment, and are often at risk of air raids. You know that for two years, almost all of our sea routes have been completely cut off, and we have had to rely on three "back doors" to transport our military supplies from overseas and to transport our exports in exchange for foreign exchange. You also know that among these three "back doors," the land route to the Soviet Union is only suitable for transporting light goods; the railway through Vietnam has been closed since the collapse of France this summer, and is now actually seized by the invading Japanese army; the famous Burma Road was blocked by the British for three months and has recently been reopened.

Today is not to tell you the stories of these disasters and the almost insurmountable difficulties. No! What I am here to tell you is: despite the hardships, China continues to fight.

You are now witnessing two living miracles: the war in Britain and the war in China. The world has begun to realize that China and Britain are the only two countries that are still resisting aggression by force, and China has been engaged in combat for three long and difficult years.

You may ask: Under such difficult circumstances, why can China fight for so long when many European countries, which are stronger and better armed, cannot avoid surrendering one by one? Let me try to explain a few reasons.

China is naturally and genetically endowed with three things that are lacking in several European countries that have surrendered; second, vast manpower, third, a historical consciousness of national unity.

The vast space and vast manpower are obvious and need not be explained in detail. I only need to say that the Japanese army's occupation of Chinese territory is limited to a few large cities and some transportation lines. Even today, it is doubtful that Japan can claim to have controlled more than one-tenth of Chinese territory. Regarding manpower, even senior Japanese commanders themselves have publicly admitted that General Chiang Kai-shek still has three million well-trained troops. That is to say, Japan also admits that the number of Chinese troops today, not counting guerrillas, is greater than it was when the war broke out three years ago.

### Sir Victor Sassoon Returns to Shanghai After Trip to India: Broadly Discusses the General Situation, Saying U.S.-Japan War Would Only Benefit Germany, Shanghai's Situation Can Ultimately Remain Neutral

The English-language North China Daily Mail reported that Sir Victor Sassoon, a prominent financier in the city, recently returned from India. Today (the 31st), he hosted a press conference at the Cathay Hotel to discuss the global situation, including the possibility of war between the U.S. and Japan, the roles of the Soviet Union and Italy in the Nazi "Lebensraum" (living space) plan, and the situation in Shanghai.

Soviet Union Free to Act Against Japan

Reportedly, he expressed doubts about Germany launching a blitzkrieg in the Balkans, as this would damage the region's summer grain harvest next year, endangering Germany's food supply. Germany, in its prolonged war against Britain, does not want to "disturb" the Soviet Union and hopes to maintain understanding with the Soviets, allowing them to act freely against Japan. This move suits the Soviet Union perfectly.

Germany Eager for U.S.-Japan War

Japan is currently being used by Germany, and Hitler's use of Japan is solely to fulfill his own selfish desires. If Japan were to go to war with the U.S., the only beneficiary would be Germany, as the U.S. would then have to keep most of the war supplies intended for Britain for its own use, weakening Britain's retaliatory power against Germany. Furthermore, Japan's supply lines in a war against the U.S. would be severely threatened by American submarines. Japan has sufficient oil reserves but faces extreme shortages of steel and cotton. Therefore, it is believed that Japan does not want to go to war with the U.S., and neither does the U.S.

Shanghai's Situation Unaffected

Sassoon further stated in response to questions that the European war would continue for at least another two years. The British government's policy is based on the possibility of a sustained war for three years, and munitions factories and various wartime activities are planned accordingly. Sassoon concluded by saying that when he left Shanghai six months ago, he was quite concerned about the situation here, but now he believes that Shanghai can maintain its neutrality and remain unaffected, which is a great relief, as Shanghai, apart from being designated as a public concession, has no other use to anyone.

### Winter Clothing Distributed Today: Clothing Vouchers Issued, Donations Urgently Needed, Women and Children Relief Association Airs Fundraising Appeal

The Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association, recognizing the cold weather and the dire situation of homeless children on the streets without adequate clothing, who are at risk of freezing to death, launched a fundraising campaign to provide winter clothing for needy children throughout the city. Since the micro-donation campaign began on November 20th, it has received enthusiastic support and generous donations from all sectors of society. As of yesterday, over 30,000 yuan has been raised in donations. The association had already solicited bids on the 21st of last month and commissioned the production of 2,000 sets of winter clothing.

Types of Winter Clothing

The winter clothing is divided into four categories: Category A (for children aged 12 to 14), 500 sets; Category B (for children aged 9 to 11), 800 sets; Category C (for children aged 5 to 8), 500 sets; and Category D (for children aged 1 to 4), 200 sets. The average cost per set was originally estimated at six yuan. However, thanks to the sponsorship of Gu Tiansheng Flower Shop and Mao Xiong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, which offered special discounts on the purchase of cloth, cotton, and dyeing, the average cost per set is only five yuan in national currency. It is reported that all the winter clothing was completed yesterday. The association is scheduled to begin distribution on New Year's Day and has dispatched personnel to conduct on-site surveys in poor areas such as Nanshi, Hongkou, Caojiadu, and Xujiahui to distribute clothing vouchers in advance. The vouchers specify the location for clothing distribution, and recipients can then collect the winter clothing upon presentation of the voucher. Although the association's fundraising efforts have been successful, they have not yet reached the predetermined target. The fundraising campaign continues, and the association hopes that people from all walks of life will contribute as soon as possible to support this charitable cause.

Da Fu Donates Rice

Da Fu Foreign Firm, which specializes in the import of food grains, has been accumulating scraps of rice and maize during the past July and August from bulk shipments of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai on behalf of its customers. According to custom, the firm originally planned to distribute these scraps to its customers. However, Mr. Jin Yunsheng, the Chinese manager of the firm, proposed to the customers that the scraps be used for charitable purposes instead, entrusting the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) to distribute them to various charitable organizations. The donation consists of 65 bags of broken rice and 73 bags of maize. In addition, Mr. Jin personally donated 50 bags of Saigon broken rice No. 1 and No. 2. The SMC has been notified by letter to distribute these donations as well. Upon receiving the donations, the SMC, in addition to sending letters of thanks to the firm and Mr. Jin, has made the following distribution: (1) Salvation Army, 65 bags of broken rice; (2) Shanghai Charitable Organizations Federation, 71 bags of maize; (3) Shanghai Civilian Maternity Hospital, [number missing] bags of Saigon broken rice; (4) Shanghai Refugee Relief Association First Hospital, 10 bags of Saigon broken rice; (5) Chinese Red Cross First Refugee Hospital, 10 bags of Saigon broken rice; (6) Pushan Villa, 10 bags of Saigon broken rice; (7) Old People's Home, 10 bags of Saigon broken rice.

### Living Standards of Workers in 1940: Prices Increase, Purchasing Power of Legal Tender Declines, Dropping to 17.25 Cents Last Month

In December of last year, the cost of living for workers in the city saw another significant increase, mainly due to the continued rise in prices of rice and coal briquettes. The changes throughout the year have been dramatic and unusual. Now that the year is coming to an end, it is necessary to compare the situation in December with that of the previous month and December 1939 to understand the extent of the increase. Taking the stable prices of 1936 before the war as the base period, the total cost of living index for workers in Shanghai in December was 579.70, an increase of 39.08 points compared to 540.62 in November, and 275.64 points higher than 304.06 in December of last year, an average monthly increase of 23 points. The purchasing power of the national currency in December, compared to 1936, fell to 17.25 cents, compared to 18.5 cents last month and 32.89 cents in December of last year. The classified index and the comparison between December of this year, the previous month, and December of last year are shown in the table below.

### Illegal Transactions of Over-aged Rice: Authorities Confirm Facts, Successful Cooperation in Past Sales of Flour at Fixed Prices, Two Flour Mills Lost Over One Million in Revenue

The concession authorities are determined to crack down on illegal trading in the rice market and thoroughly investigate rice hoarding. It is learned that several rice brokers have been found to have engaged in illegal transactions beyond the prescribed limits, and the police department of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) has dispatched personnel to investigate and verify the facts. They will be prosecuted according to law to deter troublemakers and prevent imitation.

Overview of Fixed-Price Flour Sales

Since the Battle of Shanghai, the food supply has been a constant challenge in this city. Flour, as an essential part of the people's diet, has often been subject to high prices and hoarding by unscrupulous merchants, making it difficult for ordinary people to purchase. To suppress prices and regulate the food supply, the SMC reached an agreement with Fufeng and Fuxin flour mills at the beginning of 1940 to have the SMC properly manage all wholesale transactions of flour from the two concessions, determining the amount of purchases based on the needs of users to regulate the market. Subsequently, in February and June, the SMC convened meetings with various flour shops to decide that the flour sold by these shops should be priced at the factory price plus a handling fee of 30 cents. Users who needed flour were required to apply to the SMC first, and after approval, they could present a letter to the flour shop to purchase flour at the fixed price. Fortunately, both buyers and sellers were able to comply with the regulations, resulting in a satisfactory outcome. Small businesses and the working class were able to maintain their livelihoods, and the flour market remained relatively stable.

Three Phases of Sales

The first phase of the fixed-price flour sales ran from February 10th to March 19th of last year. Fufeng and Fuxin mills supplied each flour shop with 7,500 bags of flour daily at a factory price of ten yuan per bag. The flour shops were allowed to add a handling fee of 30 cents per bag at the retail level. The flour shops' enthusiastic service was commendable, and Fufeng and Fuxin mills' concern for the people's food supply and their willingness to sell flour at fixed prices were admirable. The former Chairman of the SMC, Mr. Fessenden, sent letters of thanks to both mills. The second phase of the fixed-price sales started on July 2nd and lasted for more than a month before concluding. The third phase of the fixed-price sales began on September 27th and continued until the end of the year, with the two mills supplying over 8,000 bags of flour daily (reduced to 5,646 bags in December). During this period, the factory price was raised several times due to the higher cost of imported wheat, so that the mills could barely cover their costs and ensure a normal supply of flour. In summary, the two mills sacrificed approximately one million yuan in revenue throughout the year due to the fixed-price sales of flour, benefiting the people and maintaining social order, which is admirable.

Cooperation from Foreign Firms

On November 26th, Mr. Marshall, Chairman of the Food Committee of the SMC, sent letters to Vida, Jardine Matheson, Daofu, Jardine, and Kung Li foreign flour import firms, requesting them to ask their clients to offer one-tenth of their orders to be redistributed to flour shops and sold at a fixed price of eighteen yuan per bag (the same as the local factory price), plus a handling fee of 30 cents. All the foreign firms expressed their support for the above proposal and agreed to comply. Their clients were also considerate of the authorities' efforts to stabilize the flour market and generously cooperated. By the end of the year, foreign flour had been withdrawn four times, totaling 71,996 bags. After distributing the flour to various flour shops for sale at a fixed price to users, a net surplus of 2,700 bags remained. The SMC sold the entire surplus to the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Federation for baking steamed buns to provide relief to the poor. Therefore, all the withdrawn foreign flour has been sold at a fixed price.

Flour Prices This Month

Furthermore, due to the reduction in the number of flour bags supplied by the Fufeng mill in December of last year, the one-tenth of foreign flour withdrawn was used to supplement the supply. Therefore, throughout the entire month of December, except for Sundays and December 25th and 31st, users with licenses approved by the SMC in the two concessions could receive the approved quantity of flour daily, without any shortages. Those who have not received their flour can claim the outstanding amount from the designated flour shop. As for the flour prices for January of this year, the SMC has been in contact with the mills several times, but a final decision has not yet been reached. This is because it is necessary to consider the manufacturers' costs to ensure a continuous supply of raw materials, and also to consider the burden on users to prevent the flour price from being too high. Therefore, the price has not yet been finalized.

### Ding Da Cloth Shop's Shanghai Branch Dismantled, Occupied, Embezzling Funds of Seventy to Eighty Thousand Yuan

The Shanghai branch of Wuxi Ding Da Cloth Shop, located in Yongji Lane, Jiangxi Road, has been operating for many years. Zhu Shangyi was appointed as the director. The branch had the most business dealings with the Da Feng Cloth Shop on the second floor of the Eddie Road Cloth Exchange, buying and selling futures entirely on credit. From February 1939 to June 1940, Zhu embezzled approximately 70,000 to 80,000 yuan from the branch. Recently, the owner of Ding Da Cloth Shop discovered this and hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to file a lawsuit in the criminal division of the First Special Court, accusing Zhu of business embezzlement and breach of trust. They also requested the court to order the surrender of all accounting books. The court accepted the case, and judge Huang opened the third criminal court yesterday to summon the defendant Zhu Shangyi, who failed to appear. The plaintiff, Yuan Xiaokun of Ding Da Cloth Shop, and lawyer Lin Yingqing appeared in court to present the plaintiff's case. The court ordered a postponement and will summon the defendant Zhu Shangyi to appear for questioning at a later date.

### Gangsters Rob Yitai Taxi, Kidnap Cotton Cloth Merchant, Ji Jinfu, Staying at Shanghai-Taiwan Hotel, Abducted by Gangsters in the Early Morning, Disappearing Without a Trace

Yesterday morning around six o'clock, two customers suddenly came to Yitai Taxi Company at 188 Hubei Road and hired a car, paying 15 yuan in advance for two hours of rental. The company sent driver Cai Adong (from Pudong) to drive the No. 1770 taxi. After the two customers got into the car, they instructed Cai to drive to Xiaoshadu Road. However, when they reached the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Jing'an Temple Road, the two customers suddenly revealed their true colors, pulled out guns and threatened Cai, forcing him to get out of the car. Cai watched as the two gangsters sped away. He reported the incident to the police. At the same time, after ousting Cai, the gangsters drove the car away. On the way, they met up with two other gangsters and drove to the entrance of Yingchunfang, Lane 203, Hubei Road and parked. They rushed into the Shanghai-Taiwan Hotel at No. 3 in the lane. It was around seven o'clock in the morning. One gangster guarded the main entrance with a gun, another monitored the telephone, and the remaining two gangsters went upstairs and broke into Room 25. They pushed open the door and kidnapped [missing text] who was still fast asleep and drove to Fuzhou Road in the Yitai taxi that had been hijacked from the lane entrance. Their whereabouts are unknown. After the police received the report, they immediately pursued the gangsters, but they had already escaped without a trace. It was found that the kidnapped passenger was Ji Jinfu, from Rugao, 38 years old, a cotton cloth merchant. The hijacked Yitai taxi was later found at the intersection of Kaixuan Road and Kainna Road.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Needs Strong in the Evening

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the HSBC exchange rate announced at 9:15 AM, with a uniform increase. The exchange rate for British gold was adjusted to 3 pence 4375, and the exchange rate for the US dollar was adjusted to 5.4375 yuan. The exchange rates for other currencies such as Dutch, Taiwanese, and Japanese were also increased. As for the domestic market situation, the US banks were initially eager to supply, so the situation was strong, with the US dollar trading at 5.5625 yuan. However, thereafter, in addition to the constant demand from speculators, foreign firms were also active buyers, so by the evening, the US dollar had tightened back to 5.5 yuan. At the close, British gold was at 3 pence 484375, and the US dollar was at 5.5 yuan, both up 0.03125 from the previous day. From today onwards, it is the Lunar New Year, and banks are closed for three days, so there is no market.

HSBC Exchange Rate Increases

In the early morning, the London large bars and near-term contracts all rose by 0.0625, the New York silver price remained flat, the London gold price remained unchanged, and the exchange rates between British and US dollars remained unchanged.

The exchange rates announced by the Central Bank remained unchanged. Banks initially opened with a spot selling price of 3 pence 515625 for British gold and 6.53125 yuan for the US dollar, unchanged from the previous day's closing price. After opening, speculators showed a strong appetite for buying. Although US banks were actively supplying, the buying and selling eventually balanced out. It is estimated that a certain US bank and Chase traded the US dollar for January delivery to speculators at 5.5 yuan. The HSBC exchange rate announcement suddenly showed an increase of 0.125, with British gold adjusted to 3 pence 4375 and the US dollar to 5.4375 yuan. Other exchange rates also eased. Subsequently, Chinese banks also came to sell, and the market strengthened. It is estimated that speculators were buying the US dollar for January delivery at 5.5625 yuan. The midday closing prices for spot British gold were 3 pence 515625 and the US dollar 5.5625 yuan.

Continuous Speculative Buying

In the afternoon, both speculators and foreign firms showed strong demand, so the market tightened again.

A certain bank with favorable buying power was also reaching 5.5 yuan for the US dollar, causing speculators to continue to offer the US dollar for January delivery, which shrunk to 5.46875 yuan.

### Outbreak of Selling Continues: Gold Market Rises and then Falls, Cash Price Still 40 Yuan Lower Than Futures Price

Yesterday's gold market, in both official and unofficial trading, first rose and then fell. The 6,500 yuan mark was broken through and then re-entered. This was because it was only half a day of trading in the morning, and the foreign exchange market was rising in both official and unofficial trading. The trend of multi-party selling emerged again. At the opening in the morning, the US dollar was slightly tight, stirring up uncertain sentiments. Under the buying pressure from both gold and silver dealers, sellers did not dare to lower their hands, and the market was raised to a high of 6,570 yuan at the opening. However, a reversal soon began. The unofficial foreign exchange market followed the increase in the official exchange rate. The tendency of exchange dealers, securities firms, and the Shanghai West faction to sell led to a drop to 6,460 yuan. However, since it is the Lunar New Year starting today, there will be a three-day holiday, and short sellers were also eager to cover their positions, so the decline stopped and the market trended sideways. After briefly breaking through 6,500 yuan again, gold dealers were also seen selling, and the market closed at 6,480 yuan, the same as the previous day's closing price. Based on the midday closing price of the US dollar for January delivery at 5.53125 yuan, the settlement price was 6,315 yuan, an increase of 164 yuan. The total trading volume for the first half of the day was 6,000 to 7,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon. The cash price was still 40 yuan lower than the official futures price. Fengxiang sold 20 taels to Shengyuan each, and Xiangxing also sold a large 40 taels. Jewelry gold remained at 660 yuan. Customs gold and other prices remained unchanged.

No Gain or Loss in Official Trading

Starting in the morning, because it was rumored that the US dollar for this month's delivery was only settling at 5.5 yuan, people's spirits were greatly boosted, and gold and silver dealers were eagerly buying. The price soared out of 6,500 yuan and continued to rise. The opening price at 9:15 AM had already risen to 6,570 yuan, 90 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. When news broke that the official exchange rate had increased and the unofficial exchange rate had also eased, the market momentum weakened. Exchange dealers, silver dealers, and securities firms began to sell heavily. A certain Shanghai West-based company also sold, and retail investors also flocked to sell, so the price fell sharply, dropping by 110 yuan to within 6,500 yuan, falling to 6,460 yuan. A certain money shop and another securities firm came to buy, and the easing trend of the foreign exchange market was minimal, so the price gradually recovered, breaking through 6,500 yuan again and rising to 6,518 yuan. At noon, gold dealers, money shops, and the Shanghai West faction again began to sell, and the market trend weakened again, falling by 30 yuan. The midday closing price was 6,480 yuan, showing no gain or loss compared to the previous day's closing price. After the closing, it fell further to 6,460 yuan, which was a result of floating profits being taken. There was a fluctuation of 110 yuan in the first half of the day. There was no market in the afternoon. The selling price of the official gold from cash shops was about 20 yuan lower than the official futures price, and the buying price was 40 yuan lower than the selling price. There was still no market or price for current standard gold.

Jewelry Gold Exchange Rate Unchanged

The exchange price for jewelry gold per tael in silver jewelry stores remained at 660 yuan at Datong Bank and Xin Tonghang Bank, with the buying price reduced by 30 yuan.

### US Dollar Notes Rise by 0.2 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw official prices rise and then return to steady levels. However, in the afternoon, due to the tightening of the foreign exchange market, the unofficial trading price rose again. As a result, British and US gold pounds also rose by one yuan. British gold notes remained unchanged, and the market price remained steady. US dollar notes initially retreated to 18 yuan after the market opened, but in the afternoon, due to the sudden tightening of the foreign exchange market, it briefly rose to 8.4 yuan, eventually settling at 18.3 yuan, an increase of 0.2 yuan from the previous day. The supply of Hong Kong notes decreased slightly, and the market price rose by 0.02 yuan. The demand for Japanese gold notes was strong again, and the evening market rose to 1.61 yuan. The supply of Korean notes remained strong, and the evening market continued to retreat to 1.27 yuan.

The holiday is for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. The market will open on Saturday the 4th for half a day. Yesterday's market conditions were due to the news that the United States would transport 400 aircraft to China, making the next year's counter-offensive seem more powerful. People's confidence grew stronger. At the same time, it was heard that there would be significant financial reforms to protect the fixed status of legal tender. The market's sentiment immediately became excited. The number of sales in the market suddenly decreased. The market prices of various debt firms gradually increased due to greater demand. Types A, B, and D all saw new high prices. Ju Xin Firm suddenly bought about 300,000. Tong Kang Jiu Fu and Lian He also had demand. Only Zhi Sheng Da Run Li and Xie Kang sold relatively more.

A simplified table is listed below:

Stock Transactions: 100 shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded at a price of 84 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Red and White Sugar's Rising Trend Is Intense

### North-South Goods: Longkou Noodles Slightly Looser

Previously, Longkou noodles were scarce and mostly resold to Hong Kong, so the market price initially rose from 150 yuan to 160 yuan, and then from 160 yuan to 180 yuan, which can be considered extremely high. Recently, demand has weakened slightly, resulting in a loosening trend. Yesterday, the market price was 175 yuan, down 5 yuan, and other prices also loosened accordingly.

### Coal: Hongji Coal New Goods Arrive, Over 8,000 Tons

Recently, a certain French merchant's ship arrived with more than 8,000 tons of No. 2 Slurry, which has already arrived at the port. The managing firms are arranging trucks at the dock to unload it. It is heard that more goods will arrive soon. The market price is nominally stable but secretly loose, and it will soon decline.

### Grains: Rice Arrivals Reach Limit, Extra High-Quality Goods Still Not Sold

Foreign rice is arriving in an endless stream, and new transactions are also being made continuously. Yesterday, it was confirmed in the market that Heyi sold 3,000 tons of small-grain rice loaded on January 10th, with a price of 84 yuan and 8 jiao. In addition, it is rumored that there were many more direct orders that were not announced, and some profit-takers were selling off their stockpiles as the market rose. Therefore, after the market opened in the morning, the prices of all grades were generally flat. No. 1 Saigon was 87 yuan, No. 2 was 81 yuan and 5 jiao, small-grain was 79 yuan, and Mi Lu was 78 yuan, all of which could be sold publicly at the assessed limit price. The lower grades were even sold below the limit price. Although the extra high-quality rice was not willing to be sold off lightly with the market, the market trend was indeed leveling off. However, spot transactions were quite brisk. In addition to some inventory held by customers, the demand from various firms in this street was very strong. Because of the New Year holiday and market closure, merchants were all stocking up in advance. Therefore, a total of 13,000 to 14,000 bags of rice were sold throughout the day. There were also 300 to 400 tons of futures, with prices similar to the previous day. The price for January Mitsui original small-grain was 85 yuan, the price for February Jian Yuan goods small-grain was 85 yuan, and the price for December 9th Xin goods was 93 yuan and 5 jiao. A small amount of foreign rice arrived yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Suiyang Wheel transported 686 bags from Hong Kong and arrived at the port at about 3 pm yesterday, docking at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. It is heard that a large batch of pearl rice will arrive in Shanghai on the 5th. (Zu)

The sources of thick and thin japonica rice have mostly ended, so the amount arriving at the port has suddenly decreased, but the sales market is more active than in the past few days. Therefore, the price of thin rice is tight, increasing by about half a yuan to nearly a yuan, with Qingjiao goods opening at 93 yuan and 92 yuan and 5 jiao per dan (unit of volume). As for Kun white japonica rice, the price is only flat due to weaker sales, remaining at 98 yuan to 96 yuan, and a special price of 100 yuan.

Although the sales of glutinous rice are quite high, there are many sell-offs, resulting in uneven supply and demand, with prices down by a short yuan, opening at 93 to 94 yuan for Yili white and 84 yuan to 80 yuan for Hong Kong goods.

### Flour Market Stays Strong, Discount Flour Stops Supply

The current flour market is quite stable because it is the end of the year holiday. Although customer sales are not particularly active, the stores on this street are stocking up a lot, and the discount flour has stopped being supplied. Various factories have temporarily stopped producing flour due to a lack of raw materials and will set a new method after the lunar new year. Therefore, people are increasingly hopeful. The overall market sold nearly 10,000 bags of Kaihua Wu and Zhonglou brand Australian flour, with prices ranging from 22 yuan, 5 jiao, 7 fen to 6 jiao. Before the end of the settlement period, merchants are unwilling to sell too much and will wait for the market to open after the new year before starting business.

The wheat market is tight as usual due to rising production costs and transportation difficulties. With the news of scarce arrivals and thin inventories, and the end of the lunar new year settlement period approaching, buying and selling are becoming increasingly deadlocked. It is heard that Japanese factories are not temporarily loosening prices, while Chinese factories are temporarily suspending purchases. Therefore, the market is exceptionally calm. The market will be closed for three days for the lunar new year holiday and will reopen as usual on the 4th.

### Oil Market: Closed for Three Days, Oil Market First to Raise Prices, Oil Merchants' Speculative Mentality Generally Enthusiastic

Yesterday was the end of the lunar year, and the market will be closed for three days for the New Year, reopening as usual on the 4th. Therefore, the miscellaneous grains market was completely stalled. However, the oil market, due to speculative sentiment and the three-day closure, raised the prices of various oils by nearly two yuan in the afternoon. The reason is that the Dalian soybean oil futures market, under the manipulation of hoarders, jumped by 3.5 yuan, leading those with quick minds to anticipate a price increase when the market reopens, so they raised prices in advance to wait for the profits to come in. Yesterday, the trading volume was 150 pieces of unrefined Jiaozhou oil at a price of 89 yuan to 90 yuan and 5 jiao, and 200 pieces of new goods at a price of 90 yuan to 91 yuan and 5 jiao. There were 30 barrels of unrefined Qingdao oil at a price of 124 yuan and 5 jiao, and 50 barrels of new goods at a price of 125 yuan. There were 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil at a price of 80 yuan to 81 yuan, 50 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil at a price of 80 yuan, 50 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil at a price of 85 yuan, 20 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil at a price of 109 yuan, and 100 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at a price of 115 yuan and 5 jiao. In addition, over 1,000 barrels were ordered for future delivery, with prices ranging from 113 yuan and 5 jiao to 116 yuan and 5 jiao for the first half of January, 115 yuan for the second half of January, 116 yuan to 117 yuan for the first half of February, and 300 dan (a unit of weight) of Daya Factory soybean oil at a price of 90 yuan to 93 yuan.

Yesterday, 1,600 cans of unrefined oil arrived from Yantai. Today, 1,130 bags of soybeans, 1,115 bags of sesame seeds, and 100 bags of raw kernels will be shipped together to Singapore.

### Yarn and Cotton: Year-End Relationship, Cotton Yarn Bulls and Bears, Mostly Squaring Positions

The yarn market, which had plummeted wildly the previous day, returned to a state of tranquility yesterday. This is because the exchange rate has stabilized, while gold is still expensive, so people's minds are stable. However, actual transactions have naturally decreased due to the changing year, and the turnover of buying and selling in the market is also lower than the previous day. Also because of the year-end, both the bulls and bears are mostly squaring their positions to avoid the risk of the three-day New Year market closure. Everyone is shortening their trading positions to wait for the new spring to begin development.

The Double Horse opened in the morning, and the price had recovered well after the afternoon of the previous day, and people's confidence continued to rise. The opening price was 1,370 yuan. Once this price opened, everyone expected the exchange rate to shrink, and there were quite a few buyers. The price gradually rose to 1,379 yuan, but some bulls sold out, and the price loosened again. Then it was heard that the exchange rate opened slightly longer, and the price of gold fluctuated greatly, and people's minds turned tired, and the price gradually fell to 1,366 yuan. Buyers made small purchases in the middle, and Sheng Da had both purchases and sales. Later, it slowly recovered to 1,379 yuan, and the closing price returned a few yuan, to 1,374 yuan. According to statistics, the half-day turnover was 5,500 bales, and the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 18 yuan. The amounts purchased by various groups are listed on the left:

Fellow Merchants 5,200 Hong Kong 170

Yunnan 100 Tianjin 25

Ningbo 5 Total 5,500

### Cotton Mills' Appetite Is Weak

The current cotton situation is slightly weak because the price of yarn is mediocre, and the mills' intention to purchase is particularly weak, so people's minds are not firm. Moreover, there is no hope for active development from any party in the middle of the end of the year.

In other news, the market price of foreign cotton, and specifically, fine Egyptian cotton, rose in the early morning due to purchases by speculators. Subsequently, the price increased again due to the increase in the domestic consumption of raw cotton and purchases by some industry colleagues. As a result, the closing price was more than ten pounds higher than the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by 4 rupees.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been unusually quiet recently. The mills' intention to purchase is weak, and industry colleagues are unwilling to sell at low prices. As a result, there is no improvement in the transaction of raw cotton. However, the general expectation is that the cotton market will improve after the New Year.

### Cotton Cloth Repeatedly Suffers Setbacks

The factory cloth market was stable yesterday because it has reached the end of the year's final settlement period. The market has repeatedly suffered setbacks, and people's minds are weak. Most are watching and waiting, and transactions are scarce, waiting for next year's red market to discuss transactions again. The selling prices are fixed and rarely changed. The street traded in scattered amounts of coarse and fine cloth, twill, bleached and dyed cloth, etc., for more than 200 pieces. The Zhejiang Road, Wenyong gangs imported nearly 100 pieces of Dapeng, Fugui, fine cloth, Yihe bleached cloth, and striped bleached cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled more than 100 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and coarse and fine cloth.

The morning market for eastern cloth was flat, and the afternoon market was firm. The closing price for white goods Longtou fine cloth was 41 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen. Sijunzi serge was sold at 1 yuan, 1 jiao, and 7 fen per yard.

For export, 45 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 9 pieces to Penang, and 20 pieces to Hong Kong for transshipment to Yangon.

### Miscellaneous: Cigarette Distribution Fails to Meet Market Sales

The cigarette market has remained tight for the past few days. The factories' distribution of goods is insufficient to meet market sales, and all items are trending upward. Therefore, everyone has strong confidence, and those who hold goods are unwilling to sell them, all holding on tightly and not buying, making it difficult for market prices to fall. Yesterday, the price of Great Britain Brand was 1,385 yuan, Old Knife Brand was 985 yuan, Pinhai Brand was 875 yuan, Wuhua Brand was 675 yuan, Little Fairy was 675 yuan, Huacheng Company's Beautiful Brand was 960 yuan, and Gold Rat Brand was 940 yuan. The factories are closed for three days, and the market price is still expected to rise.

### Matches and Soap Also Feel the Shortage

The match market has continued to rise in price for the past few days because the amount on the market is decreasing daily. Those who purchase and sell to the market provide a small supply to the market, causing market prices to soar. Yesterday, the market price of Beautiful Brand was 390 yuan per box, Phoenix Brand was 385 yuan, and Miscellaneous Brand was around 360 yuan, all up more than 30 yuan from last week.

The soap market price is tight with buying interest because raw materials are soaring in price. The factories have distributed a small amount to industry colleagues to meet the market, resulting in firm prices. Gu Ben Soap is sold on the market for 24 yuan and 4 jiao per box, Xiang Mao Soap for 18 yuan and 8 jiao per box, and White Xiang Mao for 22 yuan and 8 jiao per box. (Kun)

### Metals: New Spun Yuan Sees Setbacks, Narrow Strip Steel Sells Well

The market for new spun yuan has seen several new price changes in one day in the past due to repeated tightening of the exchange rate, with the highest price reaching 80 yuan. However, since yesterday and today, the price has loosened, the gold market has fallen, and industry colleagues have not dared to push up prices. Therefore, the opening price of new spun yuan has also seen gradual setbacks. Yesterday, the price was 75 to 76 yuan per dan, down 3 to 4 yuan from before, and transactions were still scarce.

The trading of American narrow strip steel has been quite brisk recently. Because several factories on this street saw the high prices of tinplate and Huisit iron, they have switched to buying narrow strip steel, so the market is particularly lively. Actual sales are more considerable than other goods. Therefore, those who deal in this are not weak in confidence, and their opening prices are very firm. Yesterday, the market price for 200-pound assorted colors was between 120 yuan and 130 yuan per box.

### Retrospective of Cement Over the Past Year

— Yue

Before the war, China's cement was self-sufficient, and supply and demand were balanced. Although there was no surplus for export, there was also no need to rely on foreign goods. Since the outbreak of the war, the war zone has gradually moved westward, and Shanghai's environment has been special, with abnormal commercial development, and the population has also increased sharply. The demand for housing exceeds supply, so new houses are being built like bamboo shoots after the rain to meet the needs of society. Cement, as an important product in buildings, was supplied to the Shanghai market before the war by Shanghai's Elephant Brand, Qixin's Horse Brand, and China's Taishan Brand. However, after the war moved westward, Shanghai's China Factory was located in the occupied area and naturally could not ship goods. The market was supplied only by Horse Brand and a small amount of Japanese goods. Later, although Shanghai's China Factory was opened by a certain party, the amount supplied for commercial use was very small. Until last year (1940), Horse Brand had only 5,000 to 6,000 barrels arriving in the New Year, and was then restricted by the local authorities and not allowed to be shipped to Shanghai. The Shanghai market immediately felt panic, and prices rose accordingly. In addition, coal prices soared, increasing the cost of cement, leading to endless price increases. A table is listed on the left:

Month　 Price per Barrel (Yuan)

1　 12.00 to 17.00

2　 17.00 to 22.00

3　 22.00 to 22.00

4　 22.00 to 34.00

5　 34.00 to 51.00

6　 51.00 to 53.00

7　 53.00 falling to 51.00

8　 51.00 to 54.00

9　 54.00 to 60.00

10　 60.00 to 72.00

11　 72.00 falling to 70.00

12　 70.00 falling to 58.00

Looking at the right table, January, February, and March were still relatively flat. After June, the price had reached its peak. Unexpectedly, since September, a certain party has strictly controlled it, and the supply for commercial use has further decreased. Operators have taken the opportunity to hoard and speculate, causing the price to rise again and again, and to become heated. However, it is certain that things will reverse when they reach their extreme. It is common business practice for merchants to seek profit. Various cement merchants believed that there was profit to be made and ordered foreign goods from foreign merchants, hoping to gain high profits. However, the isolated island is a small place, and its appetite is limited. Cement is not like rice or cotton, which can be stockpiled for a long time. Since the beginning of last month, more than 20,000 bags of Red Dragon brand cement have arrived one after another. At the end of last year, another 15,000 bags of Indian cement arrived, and there are still 20,000 to 30,000 bags of Red Dragon brand already loaded on ships and on the way. When the news spread, the market price plummeted. In addition, the exchange rate fell, increasing costs instead. Not only is it impossible to profit, but there will also be losses. This trend was not anticipated from the beginning and was due to a lack of overall planning.
