### Large Chinese Army Assembles on the Border of Shanxi and Henan to Prevent Japanese Troops from Crossing the River; Fully Safeguarding the Central-Soviet Route and Northwest Key Locations; It is Reported that Chinese Troops Annihilated 3,000 Japanese Soldiers in Two Days of Bloody Battle in Shanxi

Chongqing - Military News: (1) A portion of the Japanese army that attacked Yuan'an from Dangyang to the north, on the 9th, detoured via Shimachao, Huangmao Cen, and Mao Pingchang to attack the old county and Lu Xitai (north of Yuan'an). They were severely attacked by the Chinese army and were eventually defeated, with hundreds of Japanese soldiers killed. The Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed and retreated. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy and is currently engaged in battle with the Japanese army in the area south of Yuan'an. (2) The Japanese army that invaded westward from Yuanqu was blocked by the Chinese army in the dangerous area from Ban Jianhe to Wufu Jian. The Japanese army was unable to succeed and suffered heavy casualties. (3) The Japanese army that attacked Feng Doukou (west of Jiyuan) invaded Feng Menkou on the morning of the 10th. A contingent of Japanese troops from Yuanqu also turned east to attack Dong Huai, attempting a pincer attack. The Chinese army divided its forces to resist, engaging in bloody battles. (Report from the 11th)

Chongqing - The official Central News Agency announced today that the Chinese army launched a counter-offensive on the Shanxi front, ninety miles northwest of Hankou. As of yesterday, it had been fighting fiercely for forty-eight hours, killing 3,000 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army's westward advance from the Pinghan Railway area has failed. Today, a Chinese military official told a reporter from the Associated Press that the Japanese army has concentrated six divisions in the Yellow River area in southern Shanxi and northern Henan, apparently intending to cross the river and attack Luoyang or Xi'an, in order to cut off the supply route from the Soviet Union to Chongqing. Military sources continued to say that the Japanese army took advantage of aircraft and heavy artillery to occupy Yuan'an and Jiyuan, and the Chinese troops formerly stationed in these two cities retreated north to Zhongtiao Mountain. These sources also pointed out that the Chinese army is implementing various plans to frustrate the Japanese army's attempt to cross the Yellow River. In the past, the Japanese army had repeatedly made such attempts, but had not succeeded. These sources emphasized that the Chinese army is determined to defend the Northwest territories where the Sino-Soviet highway is located, and also said that the Japanese offensive in central China is intended to assist the war in southern Shanxi, because the Japanese army has been blocked in Hubei, and Chinese military leaders are now concentrating their efforts to deal with the situation in Shanxi. (Report from the Associated Press, 12th)

Chongqing - Frontline news from southern Shanxi reported that fierce fighting is taking place on the north bank of the Yellow River, with the Japanese army launching a large-scale offensive against the Chinese army defending Zhongtiao Mountain. This battle is of great importance, because the safety of the Chinese army's position in northern China depends on the ability of the Chinese army in Zhongtiao Mountain to hold its ground. Otherwise, the Japanese army will completely control Shanxi Province and the north bank of the Yellow River, and may look west to Xi'an, or cross the Yellow River to the south and cut off the Longhai Railway in Luoyang and Tongguan. In addition to stationing elite troops in Zhongtiao Mountain, the Chinese side has also sent large forces to concentrate in the Yellow River area. It is noted that the Chinese army in Zhongtiao Mountain has been fighting for about four years, repeatedly repelling Japanese troops. The military and the public are now closely watching the development of the battle in southern Shanxi. (Report from Reuters, 12th)

Chongqing - Military News: (1) A portion of the Japanese army in Lianjiang, north of the Min River, attacked Zhushan (northwest of Lianjiang) on the afternoon of the 8th. They were severely attacked by the Chinese army and retreated with injuries. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to attack Zhushan and continued to pursue the defeated Japanese army, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army near Donghu (four kilometers north of Lianjiang). (2) A large number of Japanese troops reinforced Zhuji. At 4:00 a.m. on the 10th, they advanced to Caota City with a force of four to five thousand, and then divided into three groups to attack southward. One group attacked Jiu Jing Kui Shan and Xida Shan, and was blocked by the Chinese army, and then turned to attack Shi Bi Shan and Huang Jin Ta. Another group attacked Shizitou Gang and Huang Yan Shan Jian, and joined the Japanese troops attacking Huang Ti Ta to attack Shen Zhai to the south. Another group of Japanese troops attacked south via Douzi Yan. The Chinese army is fiercely resisting them. (Report from the 11th)

Shuikou - The Japanese army is besieged in various strongholds on the outskirts of Fuzhou, and dares not attack. The Chinese army is attacking them as opportunities arise. There has been some contact in recent days. (Report from the 11th)

A Certain Place in Southern Anhui - The entire Japanese army that attacked south from Hegang was repelled by the Chinese army. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. Xia Tan Town and other places have been recovered by the Chinese army. (Report from the 10th)

A Certain Place in Eastern Zhejiang - The Chinese and Japanese armies are still fighting south of Zhuji. East of the railway, a portion of the Japanese army attacked Zhangjiawu via Shanfeng Bridge and Chenchan Temple yesterday, and was repelled by the Chinese army. West of the railway, the Japanese divided their forces to attack the positions in the area of Wuta Dushan, Hengshan, Yin Xue Shan, Jiu Jing Kui Shan, and Kaokeng Shan. Jiu Jing Kui Shan and Kaokeng Shan were once occupied by the Japanese army, but were counterattacked by the Chinese army and were recaptured. The Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, retreated from the mountain tops of Jiu Jing Kui Shan and Kaokeng Shan. (Report from the 11th)

### China is Willing to Make Further Sacrifices to Prevent Japan's Southward Advance; Japanese Newspapers Demand an End to the Sino-Japanese War, Which Has Not Elicited the Slightest Response from China

Chongqing - Recent Japanese attempts to end the Sino-Japanese War and seek peace with Chongqing have not elicited the slightest response from Chongqing. The mood in Chongqing is still as expressed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in his speech on Saturday night. People here feel that Japan's indirect request for peace is due to its recognition of the hopelessness of conquering China, and that Japan now needs to concentrate its efforts on advancing southward. If the southward advance is successful, Japan can still easily turn around to deal with China. People here say that China has no intention of helping Japan escape its predicament in China, and that because of the real assistance from Britain and the United States, and in order to maintain its long-standing policy of friendship with Britain and the United States, China is willing to make further sacrifices to prevent Japan's southward advance. People here also believe that Chiang Kai-shek's unification of the interests of China, Britain, and the United States is an important explanation of China's current and future foreign policy. According to He Yingqin, Minister of Military Administration, in a broadcast to Britain and the United States on April 6, "Our purpose is a common one, the victory we hope for is your victory, and your victory is our victory." It is also believed here that the government's appointment of Guo Taiqi as Foreign Minister is enough to prove this trend, and in the past two weeks, newspapers here have written articles emphasizing the common interests of China, Britain, and the United States, and advocating the ABC policy. (Report from the Associated Press, 12th)

Hong Kong - This morning, the Dagong Bao reported that the first ship of American military supplies and transportation materials is on its way to Chongqing. Chinese experts in the United States are discussing with American officials how much and what kind of supplies the United States will transport to China. A spokesman for the US Embassy told a representative of the Chongqing newspaper that even though Europe has a great need, the quantity of American supplies to China will still be increased. It is also pointed out that in the event that the United States enters the war, the US fleet will not withdraw from the Pacific, because the United States has the ability to operate in both oceans at the same time. (Report from the International News Service, 12th)

The entire journey takes twenty-three hours. According to the Sino-Soviet Aviation Agreement signed in 1937 by the Chinese Ministry of Communications and the Soviet Civil Aviation Administration, the Soviet side was responsible for the Almaty to Moscow section, the Chinese side was responsible for the Chongqing to Hami section, and both sides were jointly responsible for the Hami to Almaty section. However, the Almaty to Moscow section was soon suspended.

Editorial

### The Mystery of Soviet Russia's Movements

Since the outbreak of the European war, Soviet Russia has been regarded by the world as an important stronghold that carries weight on the international stage. In recent days, it seems to have been regarded as the main actor about to perform on the international stage. In fact, apart from signing a neutrality treaty with Japan, which further emphasized its proclaimed policy of peace and its grasped attitude of neutrality in this region with this treaty; apart from announcing a decree prohibiting the transit of foreign weapons, and formally explaining the principle and exceptions in writing regarding the transportation and traffic that has been strictly controlled by the government for many years; apart from Stalin taking over as Chairman of the People's Committee, thereby having the "Supreme Head of State," that is, the one who actually holds the power, personally come to the fore and take control of the regime; all of these things only made the original phenomenon and substance more apparent; there are no new facts to indicate any new direction, new preparation, or any new strategy or action. Therefore, to hastily regard it as "about to perform" is too early, at least for now there is insufficient evidence. However, international telegrams have almost simultaneously transmitted that Soviet Russia is about to help Germany enter the war, and that the period of German-Soviet conflict is not far away. Such communication is naturally not mutually beneficial: such contradictions are not mutually corroborative; however, one cannot lightly dismiss these contradictory exchanges as positively and negatively offsetting each other, equaling zero. Because the intricate growth and decline of the international situation, and the spread and expansion of disturbances, ultimately have objective factors that will make this important stronghold unable to remain on the sidelines for long, and it will eventually perform.

Paying attention to world events, paying attention to Soviet Russia, everyone is eager to know what the future holds; but regarding everything about Soviet Russia's future, even if one attempts to make a definitive judgment, one cannot deeply believe in the accuracy of the judgment. What can be inferred is a mixed bag of opinions, a confusing array of appearances, some of which are possible, some of which are ambivalent and differ in their weight, and some of which are impossible; even this distinction, while still unable to obtain a definitive and accurate conclusion, is still a useful source of information for studying conclusions. For example, in a recent telegram from Chongqing, when Japanese planes attacked Chongqing, they distributed leaflets, using the material that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka embraced Soviet Russian dignitaries when he left Moscow, to clearly indicate that Soviet Russia was friendly to Japan and imply that Soviet Russia was hostile to China. This method of propaganda is what we expected to have the effect of sowing discord and inciting disputes, which we are childish enough to laugh at, so we will not comment on it for now; however, the pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese Soviet Russia that the Japanese side hopes for is impossible in fact. The decisions of Soviet Russia regarding all choices are naturally based on Soviet Russia's interests as the standard. Soviet Russia's territory spans the two continents of Europe and Asia, and it is equally unwilling to abandon either, and equally deeply hates threats. In its Asian part in the East, the only threat from beginning to end comes from Japan; now that China's long-term war has weakened the threat that the Japanese side could impose on Soviet Russia, and China's continued war will inevitably continue to weaken the Japanese side's threat, it is impossible to hope that Soviet Russia will be hostile to China. Regarding Japan, although it has witnessed its power gradually decline, and the opposition with Soviet Russia is no longer on an equal footing; however, before it can confirm that the Japanese side's threat has completely disappeared, it will never slacken its guard; therefore, the statement that it will reduce its Eastern garrison and transfer it elsewhere must be recognized as a great effort, so how could it be possible to be friendly to Japan. The signing of the neutrality treaty with Japan is enough to explain the temporary easing of the state of opposition between the Soviet Union and Japan, and it can also explain that the current Soviet Russia feels that the threat from the West is greater than the threat from the East, or even feels that it is almost impossible to maintain its neutrality on the European side.

Since the main organs of Soviet Russia are in the European part, it is only natural to give priority to covering the European aspect. If it goes beyond the nature of cover and actively goes to war, then siding with Germany or siding with Britain is not necessarily impossible. On the whole: in terms of materials, Great Britain has the richest holdings, and from the Near East to India, Soviet Russia is particularly close at hand, so siding with Germany would be a fatter share. In terms of strategy, Soviet Russia is called a bear but resembles an elephant, Germany resembles a tiger, and Britain is a whale; fighting with the tiger on the mainland may result in self-injury: if it joins forces with the tiger on land to conquer and encroach, the whale will only cry out in vain; therefore, siding with Germany is a cheaper cost. In short, the existence of the possibility that Soviet Russia will side with Germany and oppose Britain cannot be denied. In terms of belief, capitalism and communism are truly incompatible, and communism and Nazism are even more irreconcilable; the two are not only different in distance, communism and Nazism are almost congenitally irreconcilable, while Britain and the Soviet Union are not incompatible. In terms of harm, Germany is militaristic and Britain is democratic; Germany is trying to become a hegemon, while Britain is only uneasy with other countries becoming hegemons; militarism and hegemony on the same continent naturally pose a more serious threat to people. In terms of conflicting interests, there are already latent conflicting interests between Britain and the Soviet Union, but there are no new disputes; if in the Danube River basin, in the Balkan Peninsula, and in the Near East surrounding Turkey in Syria and Iraq, then Germany's every move recently has made the Soviet Union feel pain. In short, Soviet Russia has more reasons to side with Britain and oppose Germany, and it is even more impossible to deny its possibility. Comparing the two things, we compare it not by thinking that Soviet Russia has no doubts about nurturing the tiger and causing future troubles, and thus takes military actions that are beneficial to Germany. How can it be neither friendly nor hostile to Britain and Germany, at least knowing that although there is hostility, it will not directly fight, and it can do something in the cracks, and even get what it wants, as it did last year with the small countries in Northern Europe, come again once, and gain a big win again, is this not what Soviet Russia intends to do? However, the Near East is not comparable to Northern Europe, and there is fundamental doubt as to whether there are cracks for the Soviet Union, and without cracks, it is impossible to get rid of the British-German division and establish a separate army.

### Large Strike at San Francisco Shipyards; Naval Construction Program to be Affected; Police Mobilize to Guard Against Accidents

Old Yu Shan - Seventeen hundred mechanics at eleven shipyards in the San Francisco Bay went on strike at midnight on Friday. At 6:30 this morning, pickets began to operate. Five hundred police officers have been mobilized to guard against accidents. The police will be prepared at the police station in the industrial area, and special police teams will be dispatched to the shipyards. Police Chief Du Li announced that the workers in the midnight shift will continue to work until they are allowed to stop work. The reason for the strike is that the American Federation of Labor insists on refusing to sign the coast no-strike agreement. Secretary of the Navy Knox, Maritime Commission Chairman Lant, and others have tried to stop the strike, but the American Federation of Machinists, together with the machinists of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, have implemented picketing at the shipyards. This move endangers the US$500 million national defense contracts that the shipyards should fulfill. The content of the contract is to build four cruisers, twenty-seven destroyers, and dozens of other ships. After the pickets came out to patrol, another 15,000 construction workers and coppersmiths will also stop work. A spokesman for the shipwrights and joiners of the American Federation of Labor declared that 1,200 of their workers will pass through the picket line, and boilermakers, coppersmiths, and electricians will also not participate. The spokesman also stated that the agreement not to stop work on national defense contracts made at the West Coast Metal Industry Conference in Seattle last month has not been approved by any union. Oakland police officers are not allowed to take leave on Monday, and special guards will be dispatched to the Xinmuer Shipyard Company. The San Francisco traffic police will still be temporarily replaced by motorcycle team members, so that the traffic police can engage in work related to the strike. It is believed that the police's protection plan is the most detailed since the 1964 San Francisco general strike. At the same time, the machinists of the American Federation of Labor declared, "The police's plan is actually unnecessary, because we will never harass anyone who wants to pass through the picket line." A spokesman for the Shipbuilding Craftsmen's Union said he believed that the US Navy requested the deployment of additional police, and the spokesman added that the Shanghai army side avoided taking any action, and only sent the information it obtained to Washington. (Report from the Associated Press, 13th)

Workers at US General Motors Plants to Go on Strike

### US Congress to Take Action on Labor Disputes

Washington - Senate Investigator Truman threatened that Congress will take action on national defense labor disputes, especially on the Saturday strike at eleven shipyards in San Francisco Bay. These eleven plants have increased their investment to more than US$500 million since signing contracts with the government. Previously, the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations failed to negotiate with the shipyard authorities, so they decided to declare a strike. Labor disputes have also occurred at Bethlehem Steel Corporation. The company is currently building four cruisers and twenty-five destroyers. There are other smaller labor disputes, and a total of 38,000 national defense workers are on strike. At the Tieteloe local union, the Automobile Workers' Union declared that 160,000 General Motors workers will go on strike on Thursday unless wages are increased by ten cents per hour. (Report from the International News Service, 12th)

### Japanese Reports on the Dutch East Indies Actively Preparing for War; Dutch Foreign Minister Visits Australian Authorities

Tokyo - According to a report in the "Asahi Shimbun", the signs that the Dutch East Indies are preparing for war are very obvious. The public must use one day's income each month to pay for war preparation expenses. Government agencies and military agencies have all been painted in colors to prevent air raids. Air-raid shelters have been built everywhere. Although the strength of the army and navy has been strengthened, recruitment is still ongoing. Various wartime economic measures have also been implemented. Special permits must be obtained for all imported goods and exported food. Since the Dutch cabinet members came to the Dutch East Indies from London for a visit, the attitude of the Dutch East Indies authorities has become stronger. Therefore, Japanese-Dutch relations are still tense. (Report from Haitong Electric, 12th)

Sydney - Dutch Prime Minister Kerfen and Colonial Minister Weert are expected to arrive here today from the Dutch East Indies and hold informal talks with Australian Federal Cabinet members. (Report from Reuters, 12th)

### US Troops Hold Spring Exercises in Honolulu; Approximately 40,000 Troops Participate; The Scale is Extremely Large and Unprecedented

Honolulu - Fourty-thousand, an unprecedentedly large number of Hawaii-based troops, were ordered to disperse at midnight to conduct the US Army's 1941 spring exercises to test the island's important defenses in the most serious hypothetical situation (i.e., simultaneous attacks by hypothetical enemies from both the Pacific and Atlantic). Army Commander Lieutenant General Short instructed the troops that preparations for testing the defenses should begin immediately. In the early morning, infantry and other troops riding in the latest-style lightning-war vehicles moved to the batteries defending Wahu Island, preparing to take over the temporarily assigned positions. Army officials declared that the content of the exercise was a hypothetical attack on the United States by enemies from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and that enemy ships were operating near the Hawaiian Islands. Regarding this issue, it will be assumed that there has been a period of tension for several months, and then a public break will occur. Other news about the exercise will be kept strictly confidential due to military reasons. General Short will serve as a judge and will normally guide the various participating troops in the exercise. During the exercise, Hawaii will be completely blacked out on May 20. (Report from the Associated Press, 12th)

### US Congressman Dingkham Attacks the President; Claims that Key Members of the Executive Branch Advocate US Entry into the War

### South American Representatives Visit Washington to Discuss Fleet Cooperation; If Various Nations Can Unite, Naval Strength Would Be Quite Considerable

WASHINGTON - The naval commanders of eleven South American countries, invited to Washington, will provide an opportunity for the countries of the Americas to mutually discuss the defense of the Western Hemisphere. According to a Navy Department announcement, the purpose of the invitation is to promote goodwill and observe the recent developments of the U.S. Navy. However, it is also believed that the cooperation of American fleets to defend against foreign threats will be discussed. The invited countries include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela. This marks the first time in world history that naval commanders from so many countries have visited the United States, coinciding with America's assumption of the world's greatest naval power, which will be used to protect the two oceans of the world. Currently, the majority of the naval force is stationed in the Pacific. As long as the British Navy remains intact, the eastern edge of the New World will be safe. However, if this external defense were to weaken, the United States would feel great anxiety. This is the main reason why the government is advocating for aid to Britain. Therefore, the unity and cooperation of the American navies is a crucial plan. Although the armies of Central and South American countries are weak, their combined strength should not be underestimated. They have a total of five battleships (two each from Argentina and Brazil, and one from Chile). There is a strong trend in the U.S. Congress to cooperate with the navies of the United States and other American countries for mutual benefit. (United Press, 10th)

WASHINGTON - The U.S. State Department issued a statement last night regarding the speeches of Welles and Argentine Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Guisasola. Welles, in his speech at the banquet welcoming the naval chiefs of Central and South American countries, stated that this grand gathering demonstrates the determination of American countries to cooperate. Guisasola, in his response, emphasized that when the international situation is turbulent, it is meaningful and valuable for the countries of the Western Hemisphere to openly express their attitudes. He also stated that the American republics share a spirit of democracy and history, and naturally have a sense of concern for each other's interests. (Haitong, 12th)

### Japan Can Never Conquer China, Observes Philippine Newspaper

MANILA - The "Manila Daily Bulletin" today published an editorial commenting on the recent admission by the "Japan Times and Advertiser" and the "Hochi Shimbun" that Japan cannot conquer China by force. It believes that Japan is gradually becoming more realistic, but it is still far from openly admitting failure. The editorial states, "Whether standing from an individual, group, or military standpoint, the Chinese are waiting for the coming change with their inherent personality, as they have now heard the Japanese talking about withdrawing a very large portion of their troops. The Chinese are now waiting for an opportunity to destroy the weak invaders left on the front lines at any time." It also says, "The Chinese believe that the war is in their favor, as U.S. aid to China has increased. The Chinese are now hoping for the arrival of a large number of aircraft and tanks to enhance their military strength. How should the Chinese interpret the Japanese admission that the Japanese army in China feels weak due to being dispersed?" The editorial concludes, "Japan is now beginning to bargain in this situation, and they will find that China is not an easy customer to deal with." (United Press, 12th)

Chiang also mentioned the peace proposals published in the Japan Times and Advertiser, saying that these proposals clearly revealed Japan's opposition to the United States' plan. As the Allied nations provide China with military and economic assistance, they can leave Japan to China without having to send naval and land forces to China. (Reuters, 12th)

### Severe Damage to British Parliament; Westminster Abbey Suffers Calamity; Thirty-Three German Planes Shot Down

LONDON - The German High Command claims that German cities such as Berlin have been bombed in residential areas during the past few nights by British aircraft, so German troops launched a fierce attack on London on Saturday and Sunday in retaliation. That night, the British Houses of Parliament and Westminster Hall were hit by bombs, causing considerable damage. The opposite Westminster Abbey also caught fire. The debating chamber of the House of Commons was destroyed and may not be usable until rebuilt. The Chief Clerk of the House of Lords was reportedly killed while supervising the fire brigade. It is feared that two others have also perished. Finally, through the efforts of other staff throughout the night, the flames were extinguished, and important archives were preserved. The magnificent roof of Westminster Hall was pierced by bomb holes, and much of the interior was damaged. This hall, without pillars, was built in 1097 and is the largest hall in the world. Although the Parliament clock tower was also bombed, only a small part of the clock was slightly damaged, so this world-famous clock continues to tell the time. The Westminster Abbey sacristy, the best model of British medieval architecture, has suffered a calamity, but the entire structure of the Abbey remains intact. Parts such as the royal tombs have not been damaged. An architect stated that the most architecturally valuable parts of the Abbey fortunately still exist. Although the roof built in the 19th century was destroyed by the bombing, exposing the Abbey to the sky, it is not irreparable. The British Museum was hit by a bomb and caught fire. Fortunately, most of the treasures in the Museum had already been moved to a safe place, so the loss was relatively small. A Reuters reporter described the state of London after the attack, saying that on Sunday, London was covered in ash, like black willow catkins flying in the air. Although the enemy carried out a major destruction at night, the price was not small, sacrificing thirty-two bombers and their pilots. The reporter toured the British capital in the morning, and several places were shrouded in black smoke. Leather shoes, black ash, and dust fell on the streets, staining my clothes. Flames could still be seen inside the houses along the road, and fire brigades were still working hard everywhere. Bomb fragments were visible everywhere in the road, proving how many bombs had fallen. However, vehicles were still running smoothly, and buses were running continuously, although sometimes detouring, traffic was not interrupted. This is a symbol of the Londoners' determination to carry on as usual. Looking into the distance, the two tall towers of Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's Cathedral still stand majestically in the clouds. (Reuters, 12th)

LONDON - There were two air raid alerts in the London area before midnight last night, lasting a very short time. On Saturday night, British night fighters shot down nineteen German bombers, and anti-aircraft guns also shot down four. A British aircraft chased an enemy aircraft to the Dutch coast and destroyed two of them in a matter of minutes. Another British aircraft shot down three enemy aircraft single-handedly. The courage of British aircraft in combat can be seen from this. (Reuters, 12th)

### British Night Fighters Highly Successful; Many Attacking German Planes Shot Down

LONDON - British night fighters and anti-aircraft guns shot down another seven German planes last night until this morning. Counting those shot down in the previous few days, the British have shot down more than 160 German planes in the eleven days of May so far. Last night and this morning, many parts of Britain were attacked by German planes. As a result, four German planes were shot down by British night fighters and three were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. It is said that bombs fell in 40 places in Britain, but none developed into intense bombing. London experienced three air raid alerts yesterday, but was not bombed. Londoners waited from dusk until dawn for enemy aircraft to repeat the blitzkrieg they had carried out the night before. It is heard that bombs fell in the East Anglia region, the southwest, southeast, northeast, and northwest coastal regions, inland counties, South Wales, and northeast England last night, but the casualties and losses were small. Small teams of German planes flew over the coastal airspace three times shortly before dusk, shortly after midnight, and after dawn, attempting to attack London, but were repelled. It is said that only one German plane flew into the British capital last night. Aviation experts believe that the German group's scattered air raids last night may have been testing the techniques and nature of British night fighters to avoid huge losses in the future. After all, on Saturday, Germany lost 33 aircraft in one night. According to general estimates, this number represents 10% of the German planes that attacked Britain that night. And experts believe that if so many could be shot down every night, this percentage will cause the Germans to give up night raids. British experts also say that the special achievements of the British Air Force in moonlit air combat may force German aircraft groups to limit large-scale moonlit blitzes and change their strategy, relying on dark nights that are difficult to observe. At the same time, experts hope that British night fighters will continue to improve and achieve greater success, and predict that if German planes launch another large-scale air raid on a night with a full moon, 50 German planes can be shot down in one night. It has already been confirmed by British aviation authorities that British night fighters and anti-aircraft guns shot down seven German planes. Although only one German plane was seen over London last night, London suffered an unprecedented bombing on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The British House of Commons debating chamber was destroyed, and part of the roof of Westminster Abbey was bombed. The famous Big Ben was also damaged, but it has not stopped ticking. The sky this morning is cloudy and overcast, the moon is full, and the stars are orange, which is most suitable for the German planes' blitz. All air defense workers, firefighters, ambulances, service personnel, paramedics, police, hospital staff, and other personnel performing defense duties are standing on the streets in preparation, and the underground air raid shelters are filled with exhausted citizens. The air raid from Saturday night to Sunday morning was no less severe than the famous "Wednesday Blitz" half a week ago, but the scope was not as wide as that night. German aircraft groups have rarely carried out large-scale air raids for two consecutive nights. This may be because a large number of bombers are being used in the Balkans and Africa. However, ordinary Londoners know that cities such as Plymouth and Liverpool have been subjected to several nights of heavy bombing and are preparing for this type of attack. Yesterday, large crowds of people gathered in the market streets, staring blankly at the rubble and bomb craters of their bombed houses, or watching firefighters spray water on smoking houses with water hoses, or searching for machine gun bullets and shell casings that fell during the moonlit air battle as souvenirs. The air raid on Saturday night left countless wounds, small rivers and piles of charred grass caused by extinguishing incendiary bombs, 30-foot-deep craters, and houses that looked as if they had been cut in half by a knife. Among the houses hit by bombs were four hospitals, but the air raid shelters in each hospital were very well equipped, so only two patients and one nurse were killed by the bombs. Among the historical buildings, one of London's most famous churches was destroyed by fire. Observers estimate that 33 German planes were destroyed on Saturday night, accounting for about 10% of the total strength of the German aircraft group that night. (United Press, 12th)

BERLIN - Responsible authorities in Berlin announced last night that German aircraft groups had carried out retaliatory bombings of the British Isles the night before, and many air defense sites in Britain had been bombed, causing large fires. The losses in Peterborough were particularly severe. The buildings at Lulworth airfield were completely destroyed, and 47,000 tons of bombs were dropped on Fort Hill airfield (it was not specified whether aircraft were destroyed). Also, during the German attack on Maranta on Saturday, a large British Sunderland seaplane was destroyed. In addition, hundreds of aircraft participated in the retaliatory bombing of London on Saturday, dropping bombs for a total of six hours. The largest fires broke out between Waterloo Bridge and Victoria Docks. Furthermore, 29,800 tons of merchant ships in the North Atlantic have been sunk in recent days. Yesterday, another 30,000 tons of British ships were sunk, bringing the total to 110,200 tons in three days. (United Press, 12th)

### British Planes Raid Major German Cities; Drop Large Quantities of Incendiary and Explosive Bombs

LONDON - The Air Ministry Information Office said that the British air raid on Hamburg on Saturday night was fierce and effective. Pilots reported that Hamburg had suffered enormous damage throughout the city. When British planes attacked, there were no clouds in the sky and the moon was shining brightly, so the ground targets were clearly visible. The British Air Force repeatedly dropped large quantities of incendiary bombs and explosive bombs in the midst of a fiery network, and the industrial and dock areas were almost completely bombed again, causing great fires. Incendiary bombs continued to be dropped, and fires were also reported elsewhere. British bombardiers had no trouble finding factory targets. Warehouses and railway tracks were repeatedly hit by explosive bombs, and a shipyard building submarines also caught fire. The flames reached the sky and seemed impossible to extinguish. Four enemy aircraft that took off to intercept were destroyed, and at least two were damaged. Also, the Air Ministry announced that a large group of British bombers attacked Hamburg's ships and industrial areas on Saturday night, causing significant damage and large fires. Other British planes attacked Bremen, Emden, Rotterdam, Berlin, and enemy ships. One enemy warship was hit, and two supply ships were damaged. British bombers and fighter aircraft engaged in air combat with the enemy under the bright moonlight. Many enemy aircraft were hit by bullets and injured. Seven British bombers were missing. Also, British coastal aircraft attacked enemy ships, docks, and oil refineries in the port of Le Havre, causing fires in many places. Many dock buildings were damaged. Other coastal aircraft attacked ships off the coasts of Holland and Denmark. None of the coastal aircraft that carried out the attack were lost. Also, the German communique stated, "Hamburg was bombed by a large group of British planes on Saturday night, causing fires in many places and significant damage. Three civilians were killed and wounded. A small number of British planes flew to the outskirts of Berlin. Night fighters shot down eight British planes. In the North African sector, the fighting in the Tobruk area was limited to artillery shelling between the two sides." (Reuters, 12th)

BERLIN - According to responsible authorities here, British air forces have attacked Bremen, Hamburg and Berlin for four consecutive nights. None of the bombed areas have military targets. The seaside resorts of both cities have also been bombed twice. In Bremen, children's clinics, women's clinics, homes for the mute and the operating room of a municipal hospital were all hit, causing many casualties. In retaliation, the German air force bombed London heavily on Saturday night, setting fires everywhere, which could be seen from 100 kilometers away. German submarines sunk 50,000 tons of British ships in the Atlantic on the 8th and 9th and then sunk another 30,000 tons of British ships yesterday, for a total of 110,020 tons of British goods sunk in three days. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

### German Aircraft Groups Bomb British Merchant Ships; Rumors That Four Were Hit and Sunk

BERLIN - Responsible officials in Berlin announced last night that German aircraft groups bombed British ships the night before, sinking four merchant ships. One oil tanker was hit and half sunk into the water. One of the merchant ships (8,000 tons) exploded and sank after being hit by two bombs. A 2,000-ton merchant ship was sunk in a convoy. A third merchant ship (3,000 tons) was sunk north of the Havre area. The fourth ship was also sunk in a convoy. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

### Wartime Dutch East Indies-U.S. Trade Still Maintains a Surplus; U.S. Needs Raw Materials from the Region for National Defense

BATAVIA - Although the Dutch East Indies has purchased a large quantity of military supplies from the United States, it is still able to maintain a trade surplus of US$100,508,000. This figure is based on calculations during the financial period from January to November 1940. This is an extraordinary achievement during wartime. This is due to the United States' need for raw materials produced in the Dutch East Indies, which are necessary for the U.S. defense program. The prices of goods such as tin, rubber, and quinine have not changed since the recent world depression. Producers and manufacturers at the time agreed to equalize prices and profits to maintain prices. This is the current standard for the Dutch, which can protect their markets without unduly oppressing foreign manufacturers. It is expected that at the end of 1941, the Dutch East Indies will have a commercial surplus balance of US$20,000,000 in the United States. As of December 1, 1940, the total amount of U.S. imports from the Dutch East Indies was US$148,353,000, while the total amount of Dutch East Indies imports from the United States during the same period was US$47,508,000, of which US$34,000,000 was for "manufactured goods." Authorities acknowledge that the majority of these manufactured goods are military supplies. In the future, the trade balance will probably remain the same, but the Dutch East Indies' credit in the United States may increase slightly. The Dutch East Indies budget has stipulated the purchase of additional military and aviation supplies, but the United States' purchase of necessary raw materials from the Dutch East Indies must also increase dramatically. Not long ago, a notice was issued to importers, prohibiting certain products, such as American-made cigarettes, toothpaste, and certain types of American soap and tinplate that are considered not essential for defense. The prohibition of these goods will be lifted or significantly changed. Previously, the tinplate imported into the Dutch East Indies came from Wales, but now, due to shipping difficulties and reduced British exports, the Dutch East Indies' required tinplate will have to be supplied by the United States. Therefore, the ban on tinplate will soon be lifted. Economic experts expect that the same will be done for other manufactured goods that are produced in the United States and were previously imported into the Dutch East Indies. The United States has refused to grant the Dutch East Indies a gold credit to purchase goods covered by the notice totaling approximately 10 million Dutch guilders. Other luxury goods, such as cigarettes and soap, total approximately 2 million. (United Press, 12th)

### Hoover Urges America to Stay Out of War; German Report Claims British Ambassador to US Actively Seeking Aid for Britain

New York - Former President Hoover, in a radio address to the nation yesterday morning, urged the United States to stay out of the European war, stating that America is not yet prepared enough to participate in the war, and the public is not united. However, he said the US should continue to aid Britain, as Americans have complete sympathy for their brave resistance. If the US remains neutral, it can extract war materials to provide to Britain, thus the US's non-belligerent status is actually beneficial to aiding Britain. He also advised the nation to face the transitional period of the war with calm consideration, thought, and reason. Hoover also opposed the United States' inadvertent entry into the war, as it would inevitably lead to attacks on German submarines and aircraft, which would require extensive overseas naval and air bases and the deployment of an expeditionary force, necessitating preparations for a long-term war. (United Press Dispatch, 12th)

New York - Former President Hoover recently delivered a radio address here, discussing the British issue, stating that if the country implements naval escorts, it will be drawn into the vortex of war. It is indeed a fact that the country is not fully prepared militarily or industrially. However, the country is the world's leading power, and Germany cannot deceive it by claiming it lacks preparation. When necessary, the country can train millions of troops and manufacture unparalleled weapons, and will never be defeated. As for the current situation, although the country must deal with "painful facts," the Axis powers and the country have not yet formally engaged in combat. If the US wants to supply Britain with as much military equipment as possible, it is best not to get involved in the vortex of war. Direct participation in the war would not be beneficial to either Britain or the US. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)

Berlin - The semi-official newspaper "Political Foreign Correspondence" recently published an editorial criticizing the activities of British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, stating that US President Roosevelt will soon deliver a speech addressing the issue of more effective US aid to Britain. Halifax is currently actively working to arrange Roosevelt's speech in advance, and the expansion of US aid to Britain only increases the risk of the US being drawn into the war. In order to obtain more US aid, Halifax is even participating in US political activities to win support for the aid policy. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)

### Polish Deputy Prime Minister Injured in Air Raid

London - Polish Deputy Prime Minister General Suśkiewicz was seriously injured during an air raid on London on Saturday. At the time, Suśkiewicz was visiting a friend and, upon hearing the air raid siren, did not immediately seek shelter but instead stood in the street watching the air raid. Unexpectedly, a bomb hit a nearby house, and shrapnel struck Suśkiewicz in the back, hand, and neck. He has undergone surgery. As Suśkiewicz had previously suffered injuries in the military, although the injuries are severe, they are not life-threatening. (Reuters Dispatch, 12th)

### Archbishop of Canterbury States the Purpose of Britain's Struggle

London - The Archbishop of Canterbury, in a speech at the second session of the Religious Conference yesterday, stated that the primary purpose of Britain's current great struggle is to eradicate this entrenched evil force and liberate the countries currently trapped in slavery. After the war, humanity should be able to rest and establish a more beautiful civilized order than the one currently being destroyed.

Moscow - At the end of 1940, the Iraqi government repeatedly suggested to the Soviet government through its ambassador to Turkey that diplomatic relations be established between the two countries. The Iraqi government also deeply hoped that upon the establishment of diplomatic relations, the Soviet government would simultaneously issue a declaration recognizing the independence of Arab countries (including Iraq). The Soviet government believed that it could not make the issuance of a declaration a condition for the establishment of diplomatic relations. The Soviet government responded to the Iraqi side based on this point, and the negotiations were interrupted. On May 3, 1941, the Iraqi government again suggested to the Soviet Union the establishment of diplomatic relations, but this time it did not make the Soviet Union's recognition of Arab countries a condition. At this point, the Soviet government accepted the Iraqi government's suggestion to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries. (TASS Dispatch, 12th)

(Reuters Dispatch, 12th)

Turkey Not Pleased to Welcome Iraqi Minister of Defense

The Iraqi Minister of Defense, Shukat, has been visiting the Turkish capital for several days. The Turkish government is not very pleased with Shukat's visit, as the Turkish government has not yet formally recognized al-Gaylani's cabinet. However, Turkish dignitaries cannot easily refuse Shukat, as Turkey, given its position, has the Sa'dabad Pact with Iraq on the one hand and an alliance with Britain on the other. It could have mediated the British-Iraqi conflict, but the Iraqi government is colluding with the Axis powers. The reason why Turkey is keeping silent about Shukat's visit is precisely this.

Vichy - Today is the memorial day for the French female heroine Joan of Arc. It is being enthusiastically celebrated throughout France and its colonies, with high praise for the heroine's sacrifice for national unity. For example, a memorial ceremony was held in Hanoi, attended by Governor-General of Vietnam General Decoux, who delivered a speech stating, "The actions of this 19-year-old female heroine have become the responsibility of the youth of our colonial empire."

In addition, commemorative ceremonies were also held in French Morocco, Syria, and Lebanon. (Havas News Agency Dispatch, 11th)

### Franco-German Cooperation Negotiations Have Not Yet Reached Significant Decisions; Reports of French Navy Preparing to Resist US

Berlin - Regarding the Franco-German negotiations, German Foreign Ministry personnel only stated that the negotiations have not yet ended. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 12th)

Vichy - According to unconfirmed reports yesterday, French Deputy Prime Minister Admiral Darlan may have negotiated with Chancellor Hitler on Friday regarding the issue of Franco-German cooperation. The report stated, "Darlan met with a most important German figure at an undisclosed location." The tone of the report seemed to indicate that Darlan had met Hitler in person. It is claimed that the two had a mutual discussion on the entire scope of Franco-German relations. Darlan has been conducting talks with German authorities repeatedly over the past week. He left Paris for elsewhere on Friday. Observers here recalled that in December of last year, Darlan also secretly went to Beauvais to meet with Hitler and review Darlan's actions. He had lunch with German Ambassador to Paris Abetz on Wednesday, during which the two signed a temporary agreement stipulating that German forces would shorten the occupied area of the French coast and relax the restrictions between the occupied and unoccupied zones. At the same time, it was reported that Head of State Pétain was leaving Antibes and returning to Vichy. He is expected to arrive today to meet with US Ambassador to France Leahy. (United Press Dispatch, 12th)

Vichy - Associate Minister of the Cabinet Admiral Darlan is currently in Paris conducting important negotiations with the German occupation authorities. He can return here tomorrow. According to political figures, the content of the negotiations is still unknown. There has been no mention of reports that France has reduced its military expenses for Germany. As for the various rumors published in foreign newspapers, the authorities here do not comment, only stating that the reports are often contrary to the facts and not credible. (Havas News Agency Dispatch, 12th)

Vichy - Marshal Pétain returned to Vichy this morning. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 12th)

Vichy - Pétain's return from his villa in Roubaix on the southern Côte d'Azur will arrive here tomorrow. This trip was purely personal in nature to allow him to rest. However, he maintained close contact with his cabinet members while passing through cities such as Antibes, Cannes, and Nice. Associate Minister of the Cabinet Admiral Darlan, who is in Paris conducting talks with the German authorities, telegraphed the progress of the talks at any time. It is learned that Marshal Pétain is very satisfied with the results of the talks in Paris. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)

Sourek - According to news from Berlin, the new diplomatic victory expected by Berlin has not been achieved. A Basel newspaper, in a Berlin dispatch, stated that Vichy has not yet made a significant decision on restoring cooperation in the manner expected by the German side. Furthermore, the scheduled return of German Ambassador to Turkey Papen can also be seen as an indication that Turkey's development is different from what the German government's mouthpiece calls an established fact. The reshuffling of key Spanish government officials is considered to be a concrete sign of the conflict between Franco and Foreign Minister Suñer over Spanish policy. However, the German government naturally refers to Franco's actions as purely domestic affairs. A Basel newspaper, in a Budapest dispatch, stated that the border negotiations between Foreign Minister Ciano and Pavelic, the head of the German-backed Croatian state, in Zagreb, are also facing obstacles. In addition to gaining Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia also wants part of Dalmatia, which Italy is unwilling to give up. (Reuters Dispatch, 12th)

Sourek - German radio broadcast that French Ambassador to Paris Brinon disclosed that French Deputy Prime Minister Darlan had notified US Ambassador Leahy that France could no longer tolerate the British blockade and that if the United States sent troops to occupy Dakar, France would resist. Brinon also told a US correspondent that the French Navy was ready. (United Press Dispatch, 12th)

### Eu Tong Sen Dies

Hong Kong - Eu Tong Sen, a Malayan tin tycoon with tens of millions of dollars in assets and properties in Hong Kong, passed away suddenly yesterday afternoon at the age of 64. (Reuters Dispatch, 12th)

### Salisbury Plain: British Army's Large-Scale Exercise; Enemy Forces Imitate Nazi Tactics; Landing Troops Repelled in Realistic Combat Scenario

London (Reuters Special Correspondent from Southern England): The British 1st Armoured Division, along with 50,000 soldiers, recently conducted a four-day simulated battle on Salisbury Plain, practicing the repelling of a German landing force. The mechanized division acting as the enemy, comprised of several regiments of British cavalry now mechanized, imitated Nazi landing tactics but were flanked by British heavy tanks and ultimately succumbed, retreating into the sea. The combat scenario was exceptionally realistic, with army liaison aircraft, wireless radio cars, and military telephones all participating in the exercise, ensuring rapid action. General Sir Alan Brooke, Commander-in-Chief of Home Forces, and Major General Martel, Commander of the British Armoured Corps, both observed the exercise on-site. (Reuters, 12th)

### Random Notes on the European War (54): The Quelling of American Labor Strikes

This spring, labor strikes erupted one after another in major industrial areas of the United States, dragging on for over two months and involving tens of thousands of workers. National defense industries, including Ford Motor Company, Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Bendix Aviation Corporation, Los Angeles Shipbuilding, US Navy shipyards, army ordnance factories, DuPont munitions plants, General Motors, and thirty other companies, were forced to cease operations. These companies had accepted orders from the government for munitions and military equipment totaling $450 million, accounting for one-third of all military supplies, and were temporarily unable to deliver.

The reasons for the factory strikes can be summarized as follows: First, wage increases. Workers speculated that the cost of living would continue to rise and demanded that employers sign wage adjustment agreements to prepare for future conditions. Economists warned that wage increases would lead to inflation, ultimately reducing workers' actual benefits, but the workers remained unconvinced.

Second, workers aimed to secure the legal status of labor unions, believing that if they did not solidify their position during this critical period, they would fade into obscurity once peace was restored.

Third, internal strife within unions. The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and the American Federation of Labor (AFL) were the two major labor groups in the United States, long engaged in a rivalry for dominance. Within the CIO, those involved in the national defense industry largely viewed the small number of communist elements in the union as a thorn in their side, which had to be expelled.

As the labor strikes spread and intensified, French opinion was ablaze. The chairman of the Chamber of Deputies' Judiciary Committee, Mr. Sonnen, in a fit of fury, advocated electrocuting enemies hiding in factories. Secretary of War Stimson also raised his gravelly voice, proposing sending troops to clear out the troublemakers in the factories.

Most comical was the suggestion of Air Force General Brett, who advocated sending military aircraft to stage a demonstration over the striking factories, to make the strikers aware of the importance of their mission and thereby induce them to be cautious. Congressman Dies angrily denounced the communists as "jackals," and now, more enraged than ever, demanded the elimination of all red workers. One officer in Washington even vowed that the first target of the US Army would not be the enemy, but the country's own people. Meanwhile, public opinion polls showed that approximately 72% of the nation supported using forceful measures to quell the labor strikes in national defense industries.

President Roosevelt, seeing this situation, recognized that the labor-management issue required active handling. After careful consideration, he issued an order at the end of March to establish the National Defense Mediation Board, as the highest-level body to mediate labor disputes. This board consisted of eleven members, including three representatives of the public: University of Wisconsin President Dykstra (who served as chairman), University of North Carolina President Graham, and New York lawyer Davis; four representatives of labor: CIO President Murray, United Mine Workers Secretary-Treasurer Kennedy, AFL Secretary-Treasurer Meany, and Railway Labor Executives' Association Chairman Harrison; and four representatives of management: US Rubber Company Director Tewksbury, New Jersey Standard Oil Company Chairman Teagle, publishing magnate and Washington Post publisher Meyer, and American-Hawaiian Steamship Company Chairman Lagem.

Secretary of Labor Perkins was eager for someone to take on this difficult task. Upon hearing the news of the establishment of the National Defense Mediation Board, she declared that her department's existing arbitration board would temporarily step aside, providing considerable convenience to the new board. The scope of the commission established by President Roosevelt, according to his instructions, was divided into (1) negotiating agreements, (2) conducting arbitration, and (3) gathering public opinion. If the commissioners encountered difficult or unresolved issues, they could submit them to the President for a final decision. In general, this organization and…

…was similar to the War Labor Board established by President Wilson during the First World War. However, before the board could begin its work, a minor hiccup arose. Secretary of Labor Perkins had not yet asked them to mediate any labor disputes, labor leader Hillman had gone away to convalesce, and President Roosevelt was vacationing on the Florida coast. Without a leader, progress was difficult.

Fortunately, Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Knox remained in the capital. They seized the opportunity and gently urged the workers to return to the factories and resume work. While some workers affiliated with the CIO complied, most were exacting regarding the conditions for returning to work, making them difficult to appease. Finally, Perkins submitted four strike cases from New Mexico to the Mediation Board for resolution. Chairman Dykstra, upon receiving this task, promptly convened a meeting of the entire commission to discuss a plan of action.

Indeed, where there's a will, there's a way. They first quelled the brewing labor dispute at the Cyclops plant, followed by resolving the forty-day-long strike at the Vanadium Corporation. The labor-management disputes at the Tube Turns Electric and Harvill Aircraft Die Casting companies were also settled. In just three short days, they announced that the majority of factories would immediately resume operations first, and discuss conditions later. This was their initial victory.

On the other hand, statistics also demonstrate that the labor strikes that had been prevalent in the United States were already on the decline. For example, in the week of April 1st to 7th of this year, the number of strikes in national defense factories had decreased from forty to twenty-seven, and the number of striking workers had also decreased from 47,000 to 40,000. There are currently 36 million workers in factories across the country who are still working as usual, so the outlook for the labor strikes is largely optimistic.

### Inexorable Decline of Imported Rice Prices

The imported rice market continued its downward trend yesterday. Not only was the spot market affected by the impact of 50,000 bags of Hong Kong rice arriving at parity prices, but the near-term Inghwa brand also showed weakness due to contracted exchange rates, low production, and smooth shipping. New arrivals of spot Inghwa rice were doubly pressured, falling to 149 yesterday, a drop of 6-7 yuan compared to Saturday. April-May shipment rice fell to 143-144 yuan. No. 1 Saigon, for shipments of late April and early May, traded heavily at 143-144 yuan, reaching a high of 145.5 yuan, currently at 141 yuan. Broken rice fell from 114.5 yuan to 111 yuan, a decline of 3-5 yuan in each case. Spot prices initially fell, then rose, before continuing to decline in the afternoon, all down 3-5 yuan compared to last weekend. In addition to the weak sentiment from the previous day, the market also reacted to the arrival of 50,000 bags from Hong Kong and reports that a second batch of parity-priced Inghwa rice and the first batch of parity-priced Kwong rice were being negotiated for shipment, while rice stocks in Shanghai were steadily increasing. Consequently, the market immediately plummeted 3-6 yuan at the opening. Subsequently, due to the efforts of major players to rally the market, prices rebounded 1-2 yuan in the afternoon, but were still suppressed by the emergence of floating supply, with early morning prices falling to 116-117 yuan, rising to 120 yuan in the afternoon, before falling again to 116-117 yuan. A total of 8,000 bags of various rice types and 1,000 tons of Inghwa rice were traded throughout the day.

While the arrivals of thick and thin japonica rice and glutinous rice were still limited, sales had yet to improve significantly. Thus, supply and demand were relatively balanced, and market prices showed little fluctuation. Specifically, Hsinchu japonica rice was priced at 138 yuan, Kunshan japonica rice at 135-136 yuan, secondary at 133 yuan, early and late southern Hong Kong rice at 132-133 yuan, original packaging at 137-138 yuan, and glutinous rice at 117-118 yuan. Glutinous Rong rice was not traded.

### Flour Lacks Support, Follows the Downward Trend of the Rice Market

The current situation in the imported flour market is once again trending downwards, influenced by the declining rice prices. Genuine demand from customers has suddenly become lukewarm, and floating holders, seeing the unfavorable trend, have been actively selling off at lower prices, causing the market to decline rapidly. Golden Dragon brand Kan flour fell again to 31.2 and 31.5 yuan, and foreign Battery brand flour was priced at 31.4-31.5 yuan, with nearly 10,000 bags traded. The situation stabilized somewhat in the afternoon as the rice market rebounded, and genuine demand from merchants increased slightly, briefly increasing buying interest and pushing prices up by 2-3 jiao. Market prices fluctuated, rising and falling in line with the rice market. The flat-priced flour from Chinese factories remained unchanged, and the factory price of 29 yuan is unlikely to fall further.

Wheat trading was extremely quiet, with market trading virtually non-existent. Both Japanese and Chinese factories were not actively buying, waiting for the new wheat crop to come to market before deciding on a strategy. The price of old Shanshi wheat was reportedly still between 47 and 48 yuan, but no formal trading has taken place.

### Spot Cake Trading Disappears

Yesterday, the miscellaneous oilcake market faced an unfavorable environment for bulls, causing prices for various types of cakes to decline again. Transactions on the trading floor have been decreasing. Yesterday, a total of 2,000 bags of spot corn and 100 tons of corn futures were traded. Old Saigon corn was priced at 32 to 31 yuan, new corn at 33.3 to 32.5 yuan, Dutch yellow corn at 34.5 to 35 yuan, with contracts for delivery between April 10th and early May at 63.5 yuan, and white corn at 33 to 33.5 yuan. Spot trading in bean cake was non-existent, with only speculative futures trading. Over 30,000 pieces of Sang Kee cake were traded, with contracts for delivery in late May at 20.06 to 20.3 yuan, and contracts for delivery in early June at 21.08 to 21.01 yuan. One thousand pieces of Yuan Kee cake were traded, with contracts for delivery in late May at 19.05 yuan, and another thousand pieces of Tai Yu cake were traded at 19 yuan.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Easing Trend Continues

Yesterday in the foreign exchange market, HSBC's opening rates showed British pound unchanged, US dollar up 0.0625 to 5.1875 yuan, Japanese yen up 0.025, Dutch guilder and French franc up 0.0125. There was no market for German marks. Exchange rates for Indian rupee, Hong Kong dollar and other currencies remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British pounds and US dollars was still gradually easing. Due to a speculator having bought 15,000 US dollars, the rate had hardened to 5.375 yuan, momentarily recovering to flat and becoming difficult to close out. Near noon, commercial banks selling US dollars, combined with rumours of Japanese cabinet reshuffle and negative news about German U-boats protecting US warships, causing speculators to cover their positions, and Hong Kong telegrams were also being sold, resulting in a renewed decline. In the afternoon, the China Bank also sold US dollars, making US dollars for next month's delivery at 5.4375 yuan difficult to close out. British gold reached 3 pence 3.125, as British banks showed a strong appetite for buying, and gold prices returned to the 6,400 yuan level. The US dollar alone softened slightly, closing at 5.40625 yuan, up 0.0625. British gold closed at 3 pence 3.125, up 0.03125. Trading volume was extremely active throughout the day.

HSBC's Opening Rates: British Pound Unchanged, US Dollar Up

According to morning news from abroad, British and American banks were closed for a holiday. The Indian silver market suddenly tightened sharply, with international exchange rates increasing by 0.03 yuan for US dollars against Shanghai, and 0.0625 yuan for British pounds against Shanghai, with other rates unchanged. The Central Bank's official rates remained unchanged. Bank selling prices opened higher in the domestic market, with spot British pounds at 3 pence 2.8125 and US dollars at 5.34375 yuan, before hardening slightly. Next month's US dollars reached 5.40625 yuan, and speculators bought this month's US dollars at 5.375, halting the decline and momentarily softening the rates. HSBC's opening rates showed British pound unchanged, US dollar up 0.0625. After the silver equalization tax remained at 24.5%, this month's US dollars at 5.375 yuan were also difficult to close out, and rates softened to 5.34375 yuan. HSBC and an American bank suddenly showed interest in selling, causing speculators to sell, and rumours of Hong Kong telegrams selling and other negative news began, causing market sentiment to harden. Speculators and Hong Kong telegrams aggressively sold June's US dollars at 5.375 and 5.40625 yuan, with the market closing at 5.375 yuan, allowing for close out, and the US dollar also hardened to 3 pence 2.96875.

Speculative Short Selling Becomes More Eager

As gold prices continued to decline in the afternoon, speculative short selling became even more eager, with aggressive selling of June's US dollars, pushing the rate up from 5.40625 yuan to 5.4375 yuan. Zhejiang Industrial Bank offered June's US dollars at a favorable rate of 5.4375 yuan, which was once close enough to close out at the offered price. British gold also hardened to 3 pence 3.125, which was also close enough to close out. Eventually, due to the excellent buying appetite of British banks, the rate softened again. At the 4:00 PM close, both spot and June-dated British gold remained at 3 pence 3.125, and the US dollar at 5.40625 yuan, up 0.03125 for British gold and 0.0625 for US dollars compared to last Saturday's close.

### Swap Rates Favor Sellers; Gold Market Fluctuates Unpredictably

Yesterday, the gold market turned from active trading and unofficial trading to unpredictable fluctuations. Various parties were particularly unsettled due to negative rumors. Tomorrow is the day to roll over from May to June contracts, and sellers need to pay a premium of 60 yuan, which favors buyers. Major players bought and sold frequently, causing market prices to change three times in a single day, initially falling, then rising, and then trending downwards again. Prices repeatedly broke the 6,400 yuan level. The market opened weak in the morning, and foreign exchange softened and leveled out as a Chinese merchant profited by covering a short position. Securities firms, banks, and gold firms all took the opportunity to sell, and the price rose from 6,430 yuan to 6,482 yuan. Near noon, rumors spread of American convoy ships being sunk by German U-boats and news of a Japanese cabinet reshuffle, and foreign exchange softened again. Banks, securities firms, and other parties sold again, and retail investors aggressively sold, causing the market to decline again. In the afternoon, US dollars for 5.4375 yuan were also available for close out, and bank firms also sold, causing the price to plummet to a low of 6,370 yuan. As foreign exchange ceased to soften, sellers covered their positions, and the price rebounded. The market closed at 6,414 yuan, up 73 yuan. After the close, the price rose again to 6,440 yuan. Total trading volume was 80,000 to 90,000 taels, and cash trading resumed. Tianyuan sold 300 taels, Xiangxingyong sold 150 taels, Yifeng, Yongfengyu, and Defu each sold 100 taels, and Chengda sold 60 taels, all bought by the gold firm Cheng Kee, with the price 230 yuan higher than the futures price. Chida sold 100 taels of Zhongxing and later bought back 50 taels of Shijie, also 230 yuan higher. Xiangxingyong sold 100 taels of Zhongxing, 230 yuan higher. No trades were heard of in the afternoon. The price was about 230 yuan higher, about 70 yuan more than last Saturday. Jewelry was down 10 yuan, priced at 685 yuan. The rollover date from May to June is the 14th of this month (Wednesday), which is earlier than usual at 8:00 AM and will formally go on the board at 8:15 AM. The sellers are said to be paying a premium to the buyers of around 50-60 yuan, and the June contract is expected to debut at 9:15 AM.

Unofficial Market Down Over 70 Yuan

Since this morning, with US dollars for 5.375 yuan available to close out, the market was weak and soft. At 9:15 AM, the opening price had already fallen to 6,440 yuan, a drop of 47 yuan. Cheng Kee and Decheng actively bought, pushing the price to 6,460 yuan. Renchengyong, Xinfengyong, and Defu sold, causing a sharp decline to 6,430 yuan. Yida and Tongkangyong actively bought, and Renchengyong, Xinyuan, Yifeng, and Heng Kee also bought, pushing the price back up to around 6,460 yuan. Around 11:00 AM, Heng Kee and retail investors bought, pushing the price up to 6,482 yuan. Near noon, negative rumors suddenly emerged, and Heng Kee and Yida started selling, and Defu and Cheng Kee also sold, causing floating long positions to liquidate, pushing the price down to 50 yuan and dropping to 6,430 yuan. The noon closing price was 6,440 yuan. Xinfengyong sold, and the price dropped to 6,428 yuan after the close. The market opened at 6,430 yuan at 2:00 PM, down 10 yuan. Yida, Chida, and Xinfengyong aggressively sold, and retail investors aggressively shorted, causing the price to gradually fall to within 6,400 yuan, dropping to 6,390 yuan, prompting gold firms and banks to set limit orders to buy, hovering around 6,400 yuan. As US dollars for 5.4375 yuan became available for close out, Decheng, Cheng Kee, Qingtaiyong, Tongkangyong, and Xinfengyong aggressively sold, causing the price to fall to a low of 6,370 yuan. As foreign exchange ceased to soften, Yida bought again, and Dafeng and Defu also bought, causing retail investors to cover their short positions, pushing the price up to 6,415 yuan. The market closed at 6,414 yuan at 4:00 PM, down 73 yuan compared to last Saturday's closing price. The closing price for May US dollars at 5.40625 yuan was 6,442 yuan. Liu pressed down 28 yuan. After the close, Defu, Dafeng, and Yida aggressively bought, pushing the price up to 6,440 yuan. Finally, there were sellers at 38 yuan, with a total difference of 73 yuan.

Hong Kong notes continued to soften, retreating to 0.46 and 0.48 yuan in the evening market. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes trended slightly higher, with the former rising to 2.08 yuan and the latter rising to 1.79 yuan.

### Economic Musings

—Ma Liutang

Banking Weekly (Continued from 11th)

Because China's first exchange, the Shanghai Securities and Commodities Exchange, was established, Xu Yongzuo was responsible for planning and compiling the exchange's accounting affairs. In 1921, Xu Cangshui succeeded him as editor-in-chief. After Cangshui's death, Dai Lulu, the editor of the Beijing Banking Monthly, took over. Li Quanzhi followed Dai, marking the general outline of these personnel changes.

Since the Banking Weekly was published weekly, it included weekly sections on commercial conditions, finance, essays, communications, surveys, and statistics, pioneering a model for the compilation of economic magazines. With this model, economic publications were no longer without a guide, and one after another, they followed suit. The widespread attention to the Gerner Report by the Chinese banking community was largely due to the Banking Weekly's translation efforts; otherwise, Gerner's name could not have become so well-known in the Chinese business community!

Because the Shanghai banking community had the Banking Weekly, the Beijing banking community also launched the Banking Monthly. When the Banking Monthly was first published, the Shanghai Banking Weekly even sent people to help; each issue only published communication reports received by the Bank of China from its branches. Later, when Dai Lulu joined, essays and other writings also began to appear.

Following the Beijing Banking Monthly was the Banking Magazine, published by the Hankou Banking Association and managed by Li Guphan. Initially, Pan Shihao was invited to edit, but due to Shihao's illness, his brother Pan Gengsheng founded the publication. Later, Zhou Chengang continued to edit it.

To this day, the only publication still being published is the Banking Weekly, which was the first to be launched.

In 1916 and 1917, although people knew to value economic writing, those who could write were as rare as phoenix feathers. Since the Banking Weekly appeared, people gradually became familiar with economic writing through exposure. Those who are now known as economic scholars and experts were largely obscure at the time, and most were probably still studying, not as arrogant and conceited as they are today. But this shows progress, and progress is a welcome phenomenon. As the saying goes, "The younger generation is to be feared; how do we know that those who come later will not surpass us?" This also embodies the meaning of "Heaven moves strongly; the superior man strengthens himself without ceasing."

The recognition of statistics in the world was previously limited to customs publications, but Huang Renzhi was the first to utilize and classify customs publications into books. Yang Duanlu and Hou Houpei's compilations came much later. Of course, later compilations surpassed the former, but at the time of Huang Renzhi's compilation, the era was different, and this insight was indeed beyond reproach. Compiling statistics from customs publications, using existing materials, and being organized by foreigners was not difficult. But for the statistics to be created by the Chinese themselves, we must consider the Shanghai Survey Office for Commodity Prices, established in 1919, as the pioneer, which is the predecessor of today's National Tariff Commission. It was then that various statistics compiled by the Chinese themselves began to circulate, gaining a place in the world's statistics. The Banking Weekly also followed suit, compiling monthly economic statistics, printed as a booklet, and sent with the newspaper, which conveniently compiled daily market prices. Of course, the content focused primarily on finance.

The Qian industry, which has always held the reins of Shanghai's financial world, was not willing to fall behind. Finally, Qin Runqing initiated the launch of the Qian Industry Monthly in February 1921, with Tu Guangfu as the editor. Tu resigned in the autumn of 1927, and a committee was established, with Hu Shuren, Wang Chusheng, Wang Weiqiao, and Wei Youfei serving as editors one after another. The publication was suspended in December 1937 due to the incident, having published seventeen volumes. (End)

### Securities: Multiple Parties Powerfully Boost Domestic Bonds

In the unofficial public bond market, the situation yesterday was initially weak but later strengthened, as previous days had been soft, the major players put in their last efforts to pull it upwards in the afternoon. Sinfu took the lead, and Tongkang followed, which prompted some short covering, but the gains were clearly forced. Although the market closed at high prices, there was no one willing to accept the selling offer 0.1-0.2 yuan higher. This situation is perhaps a technique for the major players to find a way to exit their positions. It can be seen that Class A bonds were only in better shape by 0.2 yuan, while Class C bonds were in better shape by as much as 0.6 yuan, an abnormal situation. Let's see how the trends are today. Yesterday morning, Yitai and Hongda bought in slightly, while Tongkang, Lianhe, and Jiaoyu sold. At noon, there were more declines than gains. In the afternoon, Sinfu raised prices to buy, causing Tongkang to cover its position, and Shengda also followed suit by covering short positions, prompting Hongda to increase its bets. Jiufu also absorbed some, but Yitai was already reselling, Lianhe continued to sell, and Lemao, Yichang, and Runli aggressively sold. Although market prices rose by 0.2 to 0.6 yuan, there were only sell offers after the close, with no buyers. On the surface, it recovered by 0.2 to 0.6 yuan, but the total trading volume was approximately 1.3 to 1.4 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.

In stock trading, 200 shares of New New Company were traded, priced at 21 yuan each.

The public stock exchange opened steady, but the trend softened as the Shanghai market reported easing conditions. With the exception of rubber stocks, trading in other stocks was still active. Prices improved slightly near the close, but were only slightly higher than the lowest price.

### Yarn Flower: Yarn Sales Decline, Sudden Price Drop

The yarn market, which had stabilized slightly over the weekend, is now declining again, and the price drop is particularly severe. This is due to the continued easing of foreign exchange rates and the fall in margin calls, which has led to a loss of confidence. Actual sales are increasingly sluggish. However, the Guangdong merchants still have some scattered demand for 10-count coarse yarn, so some large bullish players are holding firm. As a result, the market situation saw a brief period of hesitation. However, recently, due to the weakness of Japanese yarn and the lack of trading in mixed-brand yarn, and the unfavorable environment, the bearish side has tended to sell off. As soon as the price drop started, sellers rushed in. In short, there are many people currently bearish, and without the development of wholesale trading, there is no hope for a turnaround in the market. 20-count Shuangma yarn was priced at a high of 1,470 yuan and a low of 1,433 yuan. The afternoon market was extremely chaotic, initially trading at 1,429 yuan, but due to the sharp fall in yarn prices on the exchange, people were panicked, and it plummeted to 1,407 yuan. However, those making a profit rushed to cover their positions, and it rebounded to 1,429 yuan at the close.

Shuangma opened in the morning, and because there were many bullish players, they continued to push prices up. However, the gold merchants had already started selling, and the opening price was 1,455 yuan. Then, due to the strong bullish activity and steady margin calls, it rose to 1,469 to 1,470 yuan. However, spot sales were only for coarse yarn, and 20-count yarn was normal, but people were holding on firmly, fluctuating around 656 yuan for a long time. Unexpectedly, as it approached 11:45, the market suddenly weakened due to the fall in gold prices and the easing of exchange rates. The selling pressure surged, and the market gradually declined, closing at 1,433 yuan. A check of the trading volume for half a day showed 10,320 bales traded. The amount bought by each merchant is as follows:

Hong Kong: 520 bales
Colleagues: 9,800 bales

Total: 10,320 bales

The current cotton situation is desolate. This is because yarn prices have fallen sharply, and both Chinese and foreign factories have little interest in purchasing raw materials. Therefore, the cotton market has also been drawn into the vortex.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Prices Fall Sharply, Market Declines Straight Down

Factory Cloth: The price drop in the JST crystal cloth market is large. This is because people are shaken, and floating long positions are being sold off, settling accounts, but there are few buyers. Therefore, cloth prices have plummeted. As a result, white fine cloth fell by 1 to 1.5 yuan per piece, coarse cloth twill fell by 0.5 to 0.75 yuan per piece, and bleached and dyed cloth fell by about 1 yuan. The market is very chaotic, and transactions are scarce. Transactions in this street amounted to over 100 pieces of various goods. Customer merchants slowly purchased only over 100 pieces of Jardine Matheson 9-pound coarse cloth and local factory twill colored cloth from Guangdong and Hong Kong. Over 2,000 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth were purchased for Singapore, Siam, and other places.

Eastern Cloth: Due to the sharp drop in yarn prices, sluggish actual sales, and great uncertainty, all cloths have fallen sharply across the board. In the spot market, the lowest price for white Longtou fine cloth in the afternoon was 46.3 yuan. Midway, short sellers covered their positions, rebounding to 48.2 yuan, but the market atmosphere was still weak, falling to 47.6 yuan at the close. The price of colored cloth "Four Gentlemen" serge was particularly chaotic. It opened at 1.512 yuan in the morning, gradually falling to 1.475 yuan. In the afternoon, the market opened and plummeted to 1.4 yuan, closing at 1.4425 yuan.

### Woolen Fabrics Rise Steadily, Le Road Recedes Step by Step

Yesterday, the selling price of woolen fabrics remained firm and high. Except for Palaisse, which was cheaper, all others were rising. Because overseas orders require advance payment of deposit and prior purchase of foreign exchange, ordering has completely stopped. As for previous orders, shipping is difficult, and it is difficult to predict whether they can arrive. Local factory goods are short and expensive due to the lack of raw materials, output is small, and prices have risen. Also, due to the surplus of legal tender in Shanghai, hoarding by both insiders and outsiders has not weakened, so confidence is further strengthened. However, looking at the sales side, (1) due to traffic obstructions, internal merchants have stopped purchasing, and it is difficult to obtain transportation permits in the occupied areas, so they cannot be sold smoothly. (2) Because the price of all goods is rising endlessly and the cost of living is increasing daily, actual sales of woolen fabrics have also weakened accordingly.

### Coal: Underground Trading of Coal Balls Eliminated

Retail Price at Shops: 16 Yuan per Load

The coal ball market, due to rumors of positive factors at the end of last month, general hoarders raised the underground price to 330 yuan. Subsequently, because the factory limited the time for clearing out, the spot price of 296 yuan was supplied as much as possible, so old orders could not be hoarded for long, and the underground market collapsed spontaneously, returning to normal. The retail price at shops is generally 16 yuan per load (there are exceptions for small factory goods, which are charged 5 yuan more per load). However, there are still expectations of rising prices in the future, and indefinite warehouse receipts are being raised by 15 yuan, according to market reports.

### Sugar Market: Spot Sugar Continues to Weaken

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to trend downward, but futures rebounded. The association quoted 24 coarse whites, with spot prices at external warehouses at 114.7 to 114.8 yuan, 70 cents lower for small quantities. The 20th day delivery order opened at 115.4 to 115.2 to 115.1 yuan, 80 cents lower for small quantities. The end of the month delivery order was 117.8 to 117.9 to 117.6 to 117.4 to 117.6 to 117.3 yuan, an increase of 30 cents. Taikoo granulated white B mark was 116 yuan at the main warehouse and 115.5 yuan at the west warehouse, 1 yuan lower for small quantities. DY mark was 104 yuan at the east warehouse, 2 yuan lower for small quantities. HX was only 20 cents lower at 103 yuan at the east warehouse.

### Rubber (Continued)

— Gao Jiannong

It wasn't until 1823 that the use of rubber was first expanded. Because there was a major chemical industrialist named Macintosh in Glasgow, England, he found the solvent for rubber - using Benzine - which could melt the rubber, spread it between two layers of thin cloth, and create "raincoats". He built a large factory in Manchester, engaged in manufacturing, and since then raincoats have become popular everywhere under his name. Later, in 1829, there were Guibal and Rattier, - French people? - The first to use the elasticity of rubber to create "garters" and "suspenders", that is, they cut the rubber ball in half from the middle, and then wrapped each half into a long strip in a spiral shape, and then divided it into strands, interwoven in the middle of cotton thread to succeed. These products were also popular all over the world, and still are now.

However, what limited the long-term development of rubber was a major shortcoming of its own. When the weather was too hot, reaching thirty or forty degrees, it would become viscous, and then collapse, and the elasticity and impermeability would be completely erased. But when the climate is too cold, it becomes hard and brittle, and easily broken. This shortcoming was also made up for in 1839 by an American industrialist named Goodyer. Goodyer was born in New Haven, and first made agricultural tools, but later his family fell into decline, so he turned his attention to the rubber industry. He wanted to improve the solid nature of rubber, so he mixed various substances into it to engage in experimentation. One day, he accidentally mixed sulfur and rubber, and used high heat to melt and burn it. Unexpectedly, the rubber that was produced was firm, strong, and not easy to melt. High heat and extreme cold did not want to shake it at all. The rubber business has progressed rapidly since then. In 1851, a Frenchman named Myrey tripled the amount of sulfur mixed with rubber. The result was that the finished product - hard rubber - was compact, bright, and easy to polish, just like real ebony. So wooden cores, buttons, bowls, dishes... decorations, daily necessities, and a large batch of so-called "Bakelite" things came out. Who knows how far rubber will develop in the future?

The quality of rubber is extremely inconsistent. Initially, Castilloa rubber from Central America was considered the best. Now, due to the indigenous people's harvesting, it is almost extinct. Since the mid-19th century, the Para city south of the mouth of the Amazon River in Brazil has exported the most, and the quality is also the best, which is what people call "Para rubber". The so-called Catilloa rubber tree is distributed in the mountains from Mexico to Peru. Initially, the Indians took rubber by felling rubber trees and dividing them into sections, which was "draining the pond to catch all the fish." There were also spiral or large V-shaped cuts made in the tree trunk. These actions were so barbaric that the rubber tree often died due to excessive "plant blood" flowing out. The natives used utensils to receive the white sap, mixed it with a kind of clay to make pear-shaped spheres, dipped it in the sap, took it out, and dried it in the sun or smoked it dry. There was a very thin layer of rubber on the mud ball. After dipping it again and drying it, when the rubber skin was thick enough, they smashed the mud core and took it out, and the so-called "elastic pear-shaped utensil" was successful.

Brazilian Para rubber comes from a rubber tree called Hovea. This tree is divided into two types, one black and one white, distributed on both sides of the Amazon River and its tributaries, in the famous Selvas forest where human traces have not yet fully reached. Rubber tappers, called Seringueros in Portuguese, are roughly concentrated in the city of Manaus - that prosperous city of Manaus perched at the confluence of the Amazon River and the Negro River. When there were many rubber trees in the past, everywhere you looked, these Seringueros, both men and women, set off for their destinations at dawn every day, carrying baskets and hampers, with knives, axes and basins. After arriving, they searched for rubber trees separately - which can also be called plant cows - and used knives and axes to cut cracks in the tree trunk. Below, they used sticky mud to stick the basins, or simply placed them on the ground. Afterwards, the sap trickled down from the cracks. The sap usually stopped flowing from three to eleven hours. So the Indians collected the sap from all places and started the smoking work. Before this work, it was necessary to first build a small adobe kiln, covered with a metal chimney, and burn freshly split palm branches and leaves inside, so that the smoke would be thicker. After the fire was lit, a wooden spatula was used, dipped in sap, and stretched into the chimney to smoke. So they smoked and dipped, and dipped and smoked, the rubber accumulated layer by layer, forming a spherical shape, some of which could weigh up to fifty kilograms. This is the so-called Para City with the purest and best quality rubber, which is transferred to various European countries.

The situation is a little different now. The rubber trees nearby have been felled by the natives again and again, and they are becoming rarer and rarer. They have to drive a small boat up the Amazon River and its tributaries to find new fields, and the season is also limited. It is roughly from July to October. When they go, they are at least in groups of two, choosing a landing point and a small adobe kiln for smoking rubber, and then laboriously searching for rubber trees everywhere, because now this rubber is always very sparse. Although there must be many "plant cows" growing in the "virgin forest" far from the river, there are swarms of poisonous snakes and wild beasts everywhere, and it is really a bit risky to go in, and the journey is long and the expenses are also high.

### Preventing Hoarding and Distributing Equally: Hong Kong Rice Will Limit Purchase Quantity, Each Person Must Not Exceed One Month's Needs, Rice Shops Will Prioritize Fixed Rice, Rice Transport Rubber Wheel Handcart Workers Went on Strike Yesterday Morning

According to the person in charge of Lap Kee & Co., yesterday he told reporters that the first batch of 5,000 tons of Hong Kong rice, a total of four ships, in addition to the Tai Koo Company's Hanyang Wheel and Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng Wheel that arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the day before yesterday), the Tai Koo Company's Taiyuan Wheel and Jiangsu Wheel arrived yesterday. In addition, there is also the Yuesheng Wheel, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai before Saturday. It is heard that the government will issue a statement in one or two days, announcing the sales method, in addition to the price and quality have been stipulated, each stone of 80 kilograms, that is, 160 market pounds, sold for 110 yuan, and strictly prohibit price increases and adulteration. According to reliable sources from Lap Kee & Co., it will be stipulated that the amount of rice purchased by each customer must not exceed the amount needed for more than one month. As for how much rice should be needed in one month, it will be determined by the distributors. It is heard that this regulation is entirely to prevent hoarding, because the rice for the next month will be supplied by another batch of Hong Kong rice, so there is no need to store more.

Four More Ships Transport Rice to Shanghai

It was also learned that this week, a large amount of rice will arrive in Shanghai. It is heard that one lot is Saigon rice ordered by the French Municipal Council, totaling 10,000 tons, part of which will be carried to Shanghai by the French ships Gouvenneut Gen. A. Varenne and Albert Sarraut. In addition to the following two ships, there are also two freighters from the Java Company, which can transport a large amount of rice to Shanghai on the 23rd of this month. Therefore, it is expected that in the future, when the supply exceeds demand, the price of rice will continue to fall sharply.

Most of the Arrived Hong Kong Rice is Sold Retail

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," after the first batch of 5,600 tons of rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council from Hong Kong arrived in port, the price of rice fell by another five yuan from 125 yuan this morning (the 12th). Responsible persons stated that 600 tons of the first batch of Hong Kong rice will be handed over to wholesale rice merchants, and most of the remaining 5,000 tons will be distributed to retail rice shops today or tomorrow (the 13th) and sold at a maximum price of 110 yuan. Rice speculators predicted that rain would delay the arrival of Hong Kong rice in Shanghai, so they slightly pulled back the price of rice on Saturday and Sunday last week. This morning, they still tried to raise the price of rice, but they had exhausted their skills, and the price of rice finally fell by five yuan.

Second Batch of Hong Kong Rice Will Arrive Within the Week

It is heard that another batch of Hong Kong rice is expected to arrive in Shanghai within the week, and thereafter, about 25,000 tons of Hong Kong rice will be shipped every month. At the same time, the French authorities are now waiting for the first batch of 8,000 tons of Saigon rice purchased from Vietnam to arrive, with a maximum selling price of 100 yuan.

Order Quantity Exceeds Arrived Amount

The Hong Kong rice that has arrived this time is small-grain rice, which is no different from the Rangoon 40-grain small-grain rice sold on the market. The rumor that rice speculators spread a few days ago that this small-grain rice contains a lot of broken rice will naturally be refuted without attack. The various grain shops and rice shops that went to Cheung Mao & Co. to pay for the goods were endless all day long. However, the Hong Kong rice that has arrived this time is only over 50,000 bags, and the rice pre-ordered by the various grain shops and rice shops is several times more than this number. Therefore, the rice that arrives first this time can only be distributed to the various grain shops and rice shops in advance for a certain number of bags to maintain the continued arrival of rice, and then supplement the pre-ordered number. Currently, Lap Kee & Co. has started to handle the distribution procedures. According to an employee of the company, the distribution procedures can be completed yesterday, and after being submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council for review and approval, distribution and sales can begin.

Rice Speculators Panicked, Market Price Continued to Plunge

In recent days, the buying and selling situation in the rice market has been improving day by day. Statistics show that since a week ago, the average price of rice in various stalls has fallen by about 30 yuan. General rice speculators holding goods are quite panicked and are all lowering prices to sell off large amounts of hoarded goods. After the rice market opened yesterday morning, due to the arrival of the first batch of cheap foreign rice, rice hoarders scrambled to sell off hoarded goods, resulting in the supply of spot goods in the market exceeding demand, and people unanimously looking down. Rice shops no longer intend to absorb spot goods in the market, waiting for the price of rice to continue to fall. At that time, the market situation was quite depressed. As a result, the price of rice in each stall fell by 4-5 yuan per stone compared to the previous market. Today, the highest price for foreign rice is 128 yuan, and the highest price for domestic rice is 137 yuan.

Rice Transport Carters Went on Strike Yesterday Morning

In this city, there are as many as one thousand and several hundred carters who specialize in transporting rice for rice shops using tractor rubber wheel handcarts. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, due to the constant rice-grabbing incidents and the soaring price of rice, each rice shop gradually switched to using trucks for transportation in order to reduce the number of robbery incidents and unnecessary losses, and gradually switched to using trucks entirely. Although the carters repeatedly requested to maintain the status quo in order to maintain their livelihoods, there has been no effect for several months. Recently, due to the soaring prices of goods, the carters actively requested relief, but the Rice Shop Association did not respond, resulting in a stalemate.

Threatened by Livelihood: Although the carters, hungry and cold, have requested a deadline for a reply and petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council, they have been unable to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, starting at 8:00 a.m. yesterday, all of them went on strike (all vehicles were not pulled out), and all 1,000-odd workers gathered in front of foreign warehouses such as the Shuntai Warehouse, where rice was stored, on the one hand, dispatching a delegation of 200-odd people to petition the northern office of the Rice Shop Association at Maoye Lane, Shanhai Pass Road. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, considering that the number of striking workers was large, was deeply concerned that other excessive actions would occur. Therefore, a large number of detectives were specially dispatched to maintain order at the places where the workers gathered. The Rice Shop Association's office sent Secretary Wang Yuting to invite the workers' representatives Zheng Xueyuan and Liu Shouming to talk, urging the workers to wait quietly for the authorities to mediate, so as to avoid the expansion of the labor unrest.

Authorities Consult: The Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council considered the matter serious and related to the entire people's food problem. Therefore, in addition to dispatching detectives to protect, it also dispatched political department detectives such as Li Bijun to conduct investigations into the truth of the dispute separately. On the one hand, it also invited Fu Qian'geng, chairman of the Rice Shop Association, to the political department for consultation, and scheduled to convene representatives from both sides today and tomorrow to conduct mediation in order to resolve the labor unrest as soon as possible. The Rice Shop Association also invited the former workers' general representatives Zhang Maocai, Li Guozhu, Liu Yufu and three others to the association at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to talk, so as to negotiate from within.

Petition Today: As for the truck workers who are currently responsible for transporting rice, it is heard that after the truck workers' strike, someone had sent someone to contact the carters' representatives, and they were also willing to sympathize with and assist the striking workers. Because the number of people was large, they were afraid that excessive actions would occur. Therefore, they organized a disciplinary team. The striking workers also scheduled to petition the Shanghai Municipal Council today.

### New Putang's Annual Donation: Separate Printing of List of Donors

Not Within the Scope of This Fundraising

The Xin Pu Yutang was founded single-handedly by Mr. Lu Bohong. For 30 years, he devoted his life to it. Over the years, he personally donated and raised funds from all walks of life, amounting to a huge sum. Since Mr. Lu passed away, his son has inherited his legacy, working together with the Catholic Needle Society to maintain it. Currently, the hall provides care for 1,000 elderly, young, disabled, poor, and sick men and women, and the monthly expenditure requires 16,000 yuan. There has never been a fixed amount of funds. This time, a temporary fundraising was initiated by this newspaper, appealing to all walks of life, and repeatedly received donations of cash, goods, and other items. Yesterday, the hall published a thank-you advertisement in the newspaper. However, the annual donations solicited by the hall at the end of the lunar year over the years, as a rule, the hall compiles and prints a list of donors, which is sent to the donors, and is not included in the number of thank-you advertisements published in the newspaper yesterday. It is heard that the list of annual donors is currently being compiled and printed.

### New American Ambassador to China, Gauss, Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow Morning: Will Go to Hong Kong to Take Office in the Provisional Capital: American Community in Shanghai Holds Grand Banquet

After reporting to President Roosevelt, he will leave for Australia to take office. Ambassador Gauss is expected to arrive in Chongqing before the end of this month. Johnson was the first U.S. Ambassador to China and came to China in 1907. He was originally an interpreter at the embassy and has a long history in the diplomatic world. He has many Chinese friends. He returned to the United States from 1918 to 1921, serving as the director of the Far East Diplomatic Office of the State Council. From 1927 to 1929, he served as the Associate Secretary of the State Council. During his time in China, he successively served as the U.S. Consul in Pan Yang, Harbin, Hankou, Changshan, Chongqing, and Shanghai. In 1938, he was the previous U.S. Ambassador to China. He stayed in Chongqing for a long time during the Chinese war, and came to Shanghai twice during that period. He was particularly sympathetic to the Chinese situation.

Starting at 9:00 a.m., friends and relatives of Mr. Jin went to express their condolences in an endless stream, numbering more than 300 people, all of whom bowed three times in front of Mr. Jin's portrait on the spiritual platform. Mr. Jin's family returned the salute from the side, and the orphanage band played mourning music, and the mood was very tragic.

Solemn Public Memorial Service

At 12:00 noon, a public memorial service was held by colleagues in the press. About 100 representatives from newspapers and news agencies arrived. First, all stood in silence and played mourning music. Then, the chief officiant, assistant officiant, and public memorial officials took their seats and lined up in front of the spiritual platform. Then, the chief officiant offered incense, wine, silk, and flowers. All bowed to Mr. Jin's portrait and read the memorial text, silently mourning. Then, the family thanked, and the ceremony was completed. The ceremony was solemn. Amidst the mourning music, the colleagues in the press who participated in the public memorial service recalled Mr. Jin's loyal, unyielding, and hard-fighting spirit in his lifetime. In addition to admiration, they could not help but shed tears.

Wreaths and Elegiac Couplets Sent by All Circles

All circles of the country mourned deeply for Mr. Jin's martyrdom for the country and sent wreaths and elegiac couplets. In addition to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang, dozens of ministers and officials from various departments and committees also sent them. In addition, dozens of wreaths and elegiac couplets were sent by Zhengyan Daily, Sino-American Daily, and various circles.

Dreary Wind and Rain, Grieving Family

Mrs. Jin, Qiu Peizhen, suffered this tragic change with a body weakened by many illnesses. Standing next to the spiritual platform, she thanked the guests, looked at the portrait, and almost burst into tears. The children Jiewu, Jieming, and Jieyun, although young, seemed to know that they were now fatherless children, and all had worried expressions on their faces. Moreover, the wind and rain added to the sorrow.

### Plague Raging in Hong Kong and Macau

According to passengers from Hong Kong who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, since the discovery of the plague in Hong Kong, it has become increasingly rampant today. The total number of people suffering from the disease has reached 674, of which more than half have died due to inadequate treatment, totaling more than 410. The Hong Kong health authorities are now starting to seal off the epidemic area and carry out all disinfection work. On the one hand, they are also forcing vaccinations. In Macau, the plague has been extremely rampant in the past month, and more than 100 people have died. The Macau authorities are now at a loss, and the general residents are extremely panicked.

### Photograph of the Memorial Hall for Jin Huating

Yesterday, the wind and rain were bleak. It marked the hundredth day since our newspaper reporter Jin Huating was murdered. His family specially rented Huguo Temple on Route Cardinal Mercier to set up a memorial altar for him. Colleagues from the local press circle, remembering Mr. Jin's dedication to journalism, his uprightness and integrity, and deeply mourning the loss of an old friend, specially went to pay their respects yesterday. The four walls of the memorial hall were covered with funeral banners and elegiac couplets from important figures of the Party and the nation. A large portrait of Mr. Jin, full of heroic spirit, was placed in the center. Simple offerings were placed before the spirit, a stick of incense was burned, and wreaths and flower baskets were arranged on both sides. (Photo by Kang Zuyi)

### Stabilization Fund Stabilizes the Exchange Market

Committee Members Chen Guangfu and Four Others Ensure Long-Term Stability of Exchange Rates

Following the establishment of Sino-British and Sino-American monetary agreements, loans, and the maintenance of currency credibility and foreign exchange stability in China, a Stabilization Fund Committee was established to be specifically responsible for the application of the fund. It is reported that the members of the committee have recently been decided. The Chinese side is Chen Guangfu, Xi Demao, and Bei Songsun; the British side is Rogers; and the American side is Fox, making a total of five people. The committee is established in Hong Kong. Hereafter, the official exchange rate will be announced by the Central Bank, the black market exchange rate will be quoted by the British-owned HSBC bank, and the entire exchange market can achieve long-term stability.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Transportation

Postal and Telecommunications Interrupted, Passengers Detour; Postal and Telecommunications in Eastern Zhejiang Inland are Normal

The state of transportation and postal telecommunications between Shanghai and Ningbo has not yet returned to normal. According to a source from Datong News Agency, since Ningbo's fall, transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo has only been maintained by Japanese military transport ships traveling directly from Zhenhai Port. Other foreign merchant ships have not yet resumed sailing. In addition, the so-called route from Qingpu to Yuyao Songpu is actually only the Zhangjiajun to Yuyao Anjiao line using sailboats, which has resumed operation. Travel agencies claiming to take passengers via Qingpu actually still send passengers to Zhangjiajun to cross Hangzhou Bay to Andong. Therefore, the only route currently open between Shanghai and Ningbo is this one. Furthermore, regarding telegrams, because the Ningbo Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications had already dismantled and loaded its equipment and retreated to Lishui, resumption is not easy. The same is true for Zhenhai, Fenghua, Cixi, Yuyao, and other places. The Ningbo Post Office has resumed operations, but the official Shanghai-Ningbo postal route is still suspended. In the past half month, there have been no mailbags exchanged. However, the post office still accepts light mail for temporary storage, pending resumption of traffic before sending. Money orders have also been completely suspended. However, telegraphic transfers to Lishui, Yuqian, Jinhua, Fangyan, Lanxi, and other places are still possible.

### Millar Transport Company: Labor Dispute Completely Resolved

Color Printing Industry Demands Double Salary Increase

At 106 Beijing Road, the drivers and laborers of Millar Transportation Company, due to financial pressures, submitted a request to the management on the 19th of last month to improve their treatment. The management issued dismissal notices, and the workers began a strike on the 19th, with the situation becoming very serious. After vigorous mediation by the industry, both sides began negotiations. It is now known that the labor dispute was completely resolved the afternoon before yesterday. Drivers will receive a uniform increase of 30 yuan per month, and laborers will receive 25 yuan. The labor side is satisfied, and the entire workforce has resumed work this morning.

Color Printing Demands

Over a thousand workers in the local color printing industry, feeling that current prices are high and meager wages are insufficient to cover expenses, began a strike on the 10th of this month. At that time, besides verbally requesting the management to improve their treatment, no specific conditions were put forward. It is now known that the labor side formally submitted documents to the management the day before yesterday, requesting a 200% increase in monthly salary and 5 dou of rice subsidy. The management is currently considering the matter, and representatives from both sides are expected to begin negotiations today to seek an appropriate solution.

### Intruders in Homes of Three Judges of the First Special Court

On the evening before last, within the French Concession, there were successive incidents of kidnapping of Zhang Yicheng, the Chief Prosecutor of the First Special Court, and Chen Ziguan, the wife of Judge Fang Qinghuan, who had previously served as a Judge in the Second Special Court. While the French Concession authorities were conducting a thorough investigation, unexpectedly, unknown men also broke into the residences of Dai Rongduo, a criminal court judge of the First Special Court, Cao Jun, a civil court judge, and Tong Jishi, a civil court judge of the Second Branch of the Higher Court. After searching and finding no trace of the three men, they left in disappointment. It is believed that the three men were not at home at the time, so they were not found.

### Various Circles Commemorate Hu Zhantang's Death Yesterday; Hu Dedicated Himself to the Revolutionary Cause with Great Merit; Remembering the Martyrs, Universal Grief and Mourning

Yesterday (the 12th) was the anniversary of the death of revolutionary pioneer Hu Zhantang. Although the Central Government stipulated that the Shanghai Municipal Government and other circles should commemorate the anniversary of Mr. Hu's death along with the Revolutionary Martyrs' Day on March 29th, in memory of Mr. Hu's pursuit of the Prime Minister and his dedication to the national revolution, his achievements were great, and his lifelong words and deeds are especially worthy of emulation. Therefore, all are united in grief and mourning to express their remembrance and are determined to emulate Mr. Hu's revolutionary spirit, work hard in their respective positions, and complete the unfinished will of the martyrs.

### Shanghai British Association, etc., Telegraph Churchill Pledging Loyalty, Expressing Consistent Support and Unwavering Determination

Reuters, Shanghai, 12th – The Shanghai branch of the British Association of China, together with the British Women's Association and the British Chamber of Commerce, telegraphed Churchill yesterday on the first anniversary of his appointment as Prime Minister, stating, "On the occasion of the first anniversary of Your Excellency's appointment as Prime Minister, we reiterate to Your Excellency the assurance that this association and others consistently support, with unwavering determination, the fervent belief in Your Excellency's leadership and the attainment of ultimate victory."

### Local Rainfall Survey

### Customs Anti-Smuggling Officers Search Tricycles

Huge Value of Copper Ingots and Daily Necessities Confiscated; Crew Members Detained

According to the Shanghai Times, it is reported from reliable sources that customs anti-smuggling officers received a report last week and searched tricycles, seizing contraband worth a huge sum of one million yuan, which was confiscated. The tricycles searched included:

Tricycle Ship Names

(1) Taikoo Company's Shandong arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on Friday; (2) Taikoo Company's Suzhou arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on Tuesday; (3) A steamboat arrived from Minhang, about twenty miles from Shanghai, yesterday morning. The customs first received a report on Tuesday,

Search Circumstances

Knowing that the Suzhou, which arrived that day and was about to dock at the Bund in the French Concession, was carrying copper and tin ingots worth over 500,000 yuan, a large number of personnel were dispatched to board and search the Suzhou upon its arrival. After fifteen hours, copper and tin ingots were found in the coal bunker. It is reported that the owner of the smuggled goods has escaped, but several crew members have been detained, suspected of knowing that there were smuggled goods on board. On Friday, customs officers searched the Shandong again and also found smuggled copper and tin ingots, which were transported to the customs office on Saturday morning and confiscated.

Customs Secrecy

Shortly after eight o'clock on Saturday morning, a steamboat arriving from Minhang was found to be carrying a large quantity of cotton yarn, kerosene, cigarettes, and candles, worth tens of thousands of yuan. Several crew members have been taken to the water police station for questioning. Customs officials are unwilling to say much about these three incidents, only stating that customs confiscates smuggled goods and maintains secrecy.

### Final Arguments in the Fang Dan Case Yesterday; Heated Debate Between the Two Sides; Plaintiff's Lawyer Cites Land Regulations; Randall's Proclamation Cannot Be Used as a Basis

The case of four Chinese landowners suing the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) for collecting land taxes on Fang Dan land was heard in the Consular Court yesterday afternoon at 2:30 p.m. in the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting room. The attendees were Judge George (British Consul-General), Lockehead (U.S. Consul-General), Horiuchi (Japanese Consul-General), Defendant's lawyer Bohlen, and Plaintiffs' lawyers Liu Shifang and Wang Jian. British Consul-General George served as the Chief Justice. The debate lasted for two hours, with heated arguments over the Land Regulations of the Yangjingbang and the Tanggu Report concerning Fang Dan land donations. However, the date of the judgment was not announced yesterday. It is expected to be given no later than one week from now.

Key Points Stated by the Plaintiff's Lawyer

After the court opened, the plaintiff's lawyer Liu Shifang stood up and said that the facts of the case were simple. The four plaintiffs were all descendants of the owners of Fang Dan land, and they had neither sold nor leased the land to others. Both parties had no dispute over these facts. Therefore, the focus of the case was purely a legal question, namely, whether the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) had the right to collect donations and taxes on Fang Dan land. According to the Land Regulations of the Yangjingbang and the speech of Mr. Mettheusdett, chairman of the Taxpaying Westerners' Association in 1870, the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) had no right to collect donations. Furthermore, Randall's proclamation of 1855 could not be used as a basis for collecting donations because before issuing the proclamation, Randall had exchanged documents with the British, American, and French consuls, stating that old Chinese residents had the right to continue residing in the concession, and that these people were different from those who entered the concession for refuge.

No Right to Collect Fang Dan Land Tax

Liu continued, stating that the Shanghai International Settlement was Chinese land, and that the Chinese government had leased an area to foreigners for residence. This was called a "servitude" in international law. The Chinese government granted the right to collect donations, so this power must necessarily be interpreted in favor of the grantor. If the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) claimed to have the right to collect taxes, then it must have clear proof and concrete reasons, and could not rely solely on analogy. Moreover, the Chinese government has always retained sovereignty and has never agreed to the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局)'s collection of Fang Dan land taxes, and has often obstructed the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局)'s collection. As to whether the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) has the right to cut off electricity and water supplies due to refusal to pay donations, this must be based on a court judgment. The Tanggu Report pointed out that violence should not be used to cut off electricity and water supplies before a court judgment. If the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局), as an administrative organ, also becomes a legislative organ, then what is it that it cannot do?

How Can the Defendant Abuse Power?

Liu continued, stating that the Consular Court was different from ordinary courts, and did not apply the laws of any particular country. Therefore, its rulings must be based on legal principles and fairness. The plaintiffs had lived here for generations, and no one could force them to sell their land. Therefore, Randall's proclamation could not be applied to them. Although the defendant claimed that the organization of the Shanghai International Settlement was a consensual group, the plaintiffs were not a part of it. Therefore, it was unfounded to apply the theory of a consensual group to the plaintiffs. If it was necessary to have the plaintiffs pay donations, then the Land Regulations would have to be amended, which would require the consent of the Chinese government. By extension, even if the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) had the right to collect this land donation, it should file a lawsuit with the court under its jurisdiction. There was no reason for the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) to abuse its power.

Defendant's Lawyer Presents Rebuttal

Bohlen then stood up and said that the ownership of the plaintiffs' land dated back to 1855, which, although before the third expansion of the concession area, was still after the establishment of the original British Concession. Therefore, the Land Regulations of 1854 and Randall's proclamation also applied to them. When the Provisional Court was reorganized into the Special District Court, the agreement signed stated that the Land Regulations were recognized by the Chinese government. Therefore, the Land Regulations were naturally valid. Since the Land Regulations stated that the Taxpaying Westerners' Association had the right to collect other donations and taxes, then according to this provision, the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) naturally had the right to collect Fang Dan land taxes from the plaintiffs.

Pretending to Overthrow the Tanggu Report

According to the former American Concession Regulations, Chinese landowners did not have to pay land donations, but the original landowners did not include their heirs. The plaintiffs' claim of international servitude was based on a dissertation by a Dr. Diao and could not be compared with authoritative works on international law. According to the opinion of international law scholar Martens, all treaties concluded under political coercion were invalid. Therefore, international public law should be the basis. The Tanggu Report, which stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) could not collect taxes from Fang Dan land, was naturally not entirely correct. As for the plaintiffs' claim that all those who did not pay donations must be judged by a court before their electricity and water supplies could be cut off, this court had already ruled in a similar case that electricity and water supplies could be cut off. Since the facts of this case were the same as the previous case, this court should rule according to precedent.

Cannot Have Retroactive Effect

At this time, Lawyer Liu stood up and said that the so-called acquisition of ownership by the plaintiff in 1855 was inconsistent with the facts. According to this time being the fifth year of Xianfeng, it was the time of issuing the Fang Dan, which was also a substitute for the Fang Dan issued in 1780. Therefore, it was sufficient to prove that the plaintiffs' ancestors had lived here before 1780. The defendant also claimed that according to the recently amended Land Regulations, the defendant had the right to collect land donations, but whether this action was valid was debatable. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) could not amend it and have the right to have legal retroactive effect.

Randall's Proclamation Should Be Based on the Chinese Text

Also, the defendant's claim that Randall's proclamation should be based on the English text was unreasonable because Randall's proclamation was issued for the Chinese to read, so how could it be based on the English text? Now Ru Bao Yi recognizes that the Chinese and English texts are consistent, which is equivalent to recognizing the validity of treaties concluded under political coercion. How contradictory is this? Judge Tanggu was hired by the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) at a high price and took a year to produce the report. Now the defendant believes that the various points based on the report by the plaintiff have no value. This is something that I cannot help but regret.

Requesting a Fair Judgment

Previously, this court had a judgment to cut off electricity and water in similar cases. I have already stated that the theory based on the consensual group cannot be applied, so that case cannot be used as a precedent in this case. Since the circumstances of each case are different, each case should be discussed on a case-by-case basis in order to obtain a fair judgment. What I am now requesting from your court is that the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) has no right to collect this land tax, and whether that micro-collection right exists still has great doubts. Your court should order the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) to seek a diplomatic solution, etc. At this point in the interrogation, it was already 4:15. The judges briefly consulted and then announced the adjournment at 4:25.

### Fell into the River and Died

Lin Weigen, a 54-year-old man from Suzhou, was crossing the Huangpu River from Pudong to Shanghai at 8:00 p.m. on the 5th. When disembarking at the Huangyuchuan Wharf outside Xiaodongmen in the French Concession, he accidentally fell into the river. He was rescued and sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but died at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. The body was sent to the coroner's office by the police car, pending examination, investigation, and notification of family members to claim the body.

### Passenger Commits Suicide by Poisoning

Zhang Jinmu, a 31-year-old man from Beiping, booked room 203 at the Guotai Hotel at 28 Balichiao Street the day before yesterday. That night, he committed suicide by taking poison. The waiter discovered him and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died. The police sent the body to the coroner's office by car. Since there were no family members, the body was photographed and buried by the charity organization. The belongings are stored pending claim by family members.

### Japanese Side Sinks Boats in Suzhou Creek; Western Newspaper Investigates in Detail; 250 Boats Destroyed in Three Days; 1,500 People Displaced

Since the local newspapers disclosed on the 11th that the English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that more than a hundred sampans were sunk or confiscated by the Japanese army along the section of Suzhou Creek from Macgen Road to Changping Road on the morning of the 10th in a bleak wind and bitter rain, causing hundreds of families to be displaced, all Chinese and foreigners expressed deep sympathy for the plight of these people. Unexpectedly, the spokesman of the Japanese Navy and the Allied News Agency decided that Japan would solemnly deny the matter. However, the English-language Da Mei Evening News, published yesterday, not only published eight photos taken during the on-site investigation on the morning of the 10th but also revealed that similar incidents had occurred on the 9th and 11th, with about 250 sampans sunk and about 1,500 people displaced.

Boat Sinking Incident Occurs Again

The English-language Da Mei Evening News stated that forty-eight hours after the spokesman of the Japanese Navy denied that the Japanese army had sunk sampans, it was heard that eighty small sampans had been sunk again yesterday. According to eyewitnesses, soldiers of the Japanese Naval Special Landing Forces, carrying axes and sledgehammers, went to the previous shipwreck site yesterday and forced the boatmen to sink the sampans. If the boatmen were unwilling, the Japanese army planned to tow the sampans to other places. This morning, an old woman, over sixty years old, told reporters with tears in her eyes that she relied entirely on her sixteen-year-old son's peddling for a living, so she could not afford to rent a house. Now the only place where they could live has been destroyed, and their future life is unimaginable.

Investigation Results Completely Confirmed

According to the results of the continued investigation this morning (the 12th), it has been completely confirmed that the boat sinking action that occurred last Saturday (the 10th) did indeed take place. The Zi Lin Western News and the Thames News reported that the Japanese army denied the matter and claimed that this newspaper's disclosure of the news was "reversing right and wrong," which proves that the above two newspapers did not send reporters to the site for an on-site investigation after the incident occurred. According to eyewitnesses, in addition to the more than one hundred sampans sunk last Saturday (the 10th), sampans were also sunk last Friday (the 9th). A total of about 250 sampans were destroyed before and after. It was also heard that some sampans had been towed away by the Japanese side, while others were dismantled by the owners and sold as timber.

Some Boat Households Still Remain on the Riverbank

Several reed sheds were seen along the Suzhou Creek near Macgen Road this morning. According to a senior police officer of the Gordon Road Police Station, most of the displaced boatmen lived in the reed sheds. The number has been decreasing day by day, because the police cannot allow them to stay there for a long time. The police officer also said that if they do not immediately and voluntarily leave, the police will be forced to take necessary steps to disperse them. However, they are currently observing the development. It is said that the boat-sinking action of the Japanese Naval Special Landing Forces was to search for some terrorists. Unexpectedly, it has made about 1,500 Chinese homeless in this torrential rain.

Western Newspapers Comment on This

The English-language Da Mei Evening News yesterday commented on the Japanese military spokesman's denial of the Japanese military's sinking of sampans, saying, "The Japanese spokesman may one day be able to explain to us what benefit sinking sampans in the Suzhou Creek, causing hundreds of people to suffer the hardship of displacement, will have in the process of building a 'New Order.' Now our understanding of the 'New Order' is really too little, but we firmly believe that the Japanese side's explanation will also be difficult to satisfy us. All the actions of Japan in the past four years have been unreasonable, and now they are becoming more and more intense, which really makes us think a hundred times and still cannot understand. If it is to hate the Chinese, then this action has almost reached its peak. However, what we cannot deny is that, in terms of moral standing, those with knowledge among the Japanese must recognize that this action by the Japanese side is a suicidal policy in politics. However, what we deeply regret is that these clear-headed Japanese people are only a minority. Because of the silence of these people, Japan is in trouble today. Therefore, the day when Japan can rise again in the international community must be when these people change from a minority to a majority and change from silence to daring to speak."

### Wei Bu Hospital Offers Free Smoking Cessation; First Group Successfully Withdrawn

Weiguang Hospital's free smoking cessation program has achieved remarkable results. The first group of people who were admitted to the hospital on the 1st of this month included Zai Yunsheng, from the academic community, residing at 15 Ximen Road; Zhang Yongpei, a postal worker, residing at 114 Lane 327 Park Road; and Huang Huankui, a teacher, residing at 15 Hengqing Lane, Beile Road. All three have quit their old habits and were discharged from the hospital on the 7th. The second group, Wei Lisheng, Zhang Ruiqing, and Caballo (Portuguese), were admitted on the same day and are currently receiving treatment. It is noted that the first group also included Shen Shicai, Weng Renjie, and Zhao Jinshi, who were receiving outpatient treatment. Outpatient quitters do not stop taking drugs immediately but gradually reduce their addiction, so the withdrawal period is slightly longer than that of inpatients.

### Fu Pinggui Attacked in Front of the Zhonghui Bank; Fu Escapes into Armored Car; Bodyguard Zhang Lianzong Dies from a Bullet Wound

Fu Pinggui, the 47-year-old son of the deceased Fu Xiaoan from Zhenhai, residing at 1189 Avenue Joffre, has been a director of the Zhonghui Bank at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Henan Road for many years. He uses an armored car for transportation and employs Zhang Lianzong as a bodyguard, who accompanies him to protect him.

Leaving After Work

At 12:10 p.m. yesterday, Fu Pinggui finished his work at the Zhonghui Bank and planned to go home with his friend for lunch. Just as he left the bank gate, his bodyguard Zhang Lianzong closely followed him. As he was about to enter the car, a young assassin, who had been lying in wait there, rushed forward and drew a pistol.

Seven or Eight Shots Fired

The assassin fired seven or eight shots at Fu in succession. At that time, Fu suddenly heard gunshots and quickly rushed into his armored car to hide, and he was not hit. However, Fu's bodyguard Zhang Lianzong saw the situation and immediately took out his pistol, intending to fight back. But his back had already been pierced by a bullet, and he fell to the ground with a wound, with blood gushing out like a spring. The assassin saw that Fu's bodyguard had been knocked down and fled in all directions, disappearing in an instant.

Assassin Flees

After the incident, the Mailand Police Station of the French Concession, which was nearby, also received the news and immediately dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and Western detectives, blocking the traffic on that section of the road and conducting a search. However, the assassin had escaped into the International Settlement, and only a few shell casings were found at the scene. A car was then summoned to transport the injured Zhang Lianzong to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The police dispatched detectives to escort the victim, Fu Pinggui, home, and ordered all detectives on duty to investigate and arrest the fugitive murderer.

Bodyguard Dies

The details of the case are being thoroughly investigated by the police. However, the injured bodyguard, Zhang Lianzong, was sent to the hospital, but died of his serious injuries soon after treatment proved ineffective.

### A Girl Struck and Killed by a Bus

Xu Erbao, a nine-year-old girl from Jiangbei, residing in a straw shed on Haig Road and Bubbling Well Road, was chasing and playing with Zheng Hai on Haig Road at 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday when she was struck by a British-owned Route 7 bus. She was sent to the hospital but died before she could be treated. The body was sent to the coroner's office by the French Police car. Yesterday, the body was claimed by the girl's father.

### Inside the Threatening Letter: Two Bullets Enclosed

At 8:05 AM on the 10th of this month, a letter was delivered to the residence of Mr. Cao Baogen, a cotton yarn merchant residing at No. 95, Lane 1462, Edward Road. Cao's son, Songnian, received the letter and noticed two bullets inside. Realizing it was a threatening letter from bandits, he immediately gave chase, catching up with the deliveryman, Xu Xichang, a Ningbo native, at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Avenue Foch. Together with Chinese detective Zhang Peilan and Chinese constable No. 3194, he apprehended Xu and took him to the police station. Upon opening the letter, it was found to contain no specific amount of money demanded, but instead instructed Cao to send a representative to a gambling den for negotiations, with the bearer to carry a newspaper as a signal. Xu confessed that the letter was written by Wu Fugui and that he was merely delivering it. This morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan requested a postponement to investigate accomplices. After questioning by Judge Zhong Qing, the request was granted, and Xu was ordered to be detained pending further interrogation.

Confucius's Teachings: The Culmination of the Five Teachings - A Speech by Shen Daling at the Rongwu Society

At the fifteenth lecture of the Rongwu Scripture Society, Mr. Shen Daling spoke on the teachings of Confucius, not limiting it to Confucianism. He stated that while the world often regards Confucius as the founder of Confucianism, in reality, the status of Confucianism in Ban Gu's "Book of Han: Treatise on Literature" was only one of the Nine Schools. Confucius, however, edited the Six Classics, and his subtle words and profound meaning directly inherited the hearts of Fu Xi through Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou. The Yao Yue chapter of the Analects, in particular, emphasized the word "zhong" (the mean), revealing the essence of Confucian learning. The Wan Zhang chapter of Mencius refers to Confucius as "the sage of the times" and "the culmination of all virtue." The Gongsun Chou chapter states, "Since the beginning of mankind, there has been no Confucius." Furthermore, Zigon said, "Since the beginning of mankind, there has been no teacher like Confucius," and You Ruo said, "Since the beginning of mankind, there has been no one more prominent than Confucius." The respect is utmost. Sima Qian revered Confucius as the "Ultimate Sage," establishing a definitive view for all ages. Therefore, the Treatise on Literature begins by saying, "After Confucius died, his subtle words ceased; after the seventy disciples passed away, the great meaning went astray." How lamentable are these words! This was likely said by Liu Xiang after collating the classics in the Seven Records, and Ban Gu adopted it.

Upon examining the various classics, the "Rites of Zhou" states that the "Ru" (Confucians) in the "Grand Minister of Heaven" section "obtain the people through the Way," indicating the special responsibility of Confucianism. In the "Ru Xing" (Confucian Conduct) chapter of the "Book of Rites," Confucius lists fifteen characteristics of a Confucian, concluding with the "Confucian as a sage," making Duke Ai afraid to treat Confucianism as a joke.

The Buddhist "Heart Sutra" speaks of "the emptiness of the five aggregates." Comparing this with the Analects, "Kong Kong Ru Ye" in the "Xian Jin" chapter and "Hui, he is almost there, repeatedly empty" suggests that Confucius did not mean "empty" as in "lacking," but rather emphasized the concept of "emptiness in the middle," which is close to what Buddhists call "emptiness." The "Six Paramitas" of the Six Degrees Sutra, especially the first degree, aligns with the Analects' Yong Ye chapter's saying that "bestowing widely and benefiting the masses is the characteristic of a sage." Giving includes giving wealth, giving strength, and giving the Dharma. "Bestowing widely" encompasses all three, not just giving wealth. Thus, it is said, "Why speak only of benevolence? It must be sagehood!" Giving wealth aligns with the Analects' Yong Ye chapter, which states, "Yuangen resigned the grain, saying, 'Give it to your neighbors and community.'" Giving strength aligns with the Analects' Yan Yuan chapter, which states, "The gentleman helps others to achieve what is good." Giving the Dharma aligns with the Analects' Shu Er chapter, which twice mentions "teaching tirelessly." "Shila," translated as "observance of precepts," aligns with the Analects' Ji Shi chapter, which condemns the "three prohibitions" of greed, anger, and ignorance. "Kshanti," translated as "patience," aligns with the Analects' Wei Linggong chapter, which states, "Impatience in small matters spoils great plans." "Virya," translated as "diligence," aligns with the Analects' Xue Er chapter, which emphasizes being "diligent in affairs," the Li Ren chapter, which emphasizes being "diligent in action," the Yang Huo chapter and the Yao Yue chapter, both emphasizing that "diligence leads to success," the Shu Er chapter, which emphasizes "learning without being tired and teaching without being weary," the Tai Bo chapter, which emphasizes "learning as if constantly falling behind, fearing lest one should lose it," and the Zi Han chapter, which states, "Advancing is my path." The Doctrine of the Mean states, "Tell Duke Ai, if others can do it once, I will do it a hundred times; if others can do it ten times, I will do it a thousand times." "Dhyana," or meditation, aligns with the "Great Learning" chapter of the "Book of Rites," which states, "Knowing where to rest, one can be firm; being firm, one can be tranquil; being tranquil, one can be at peace." Zhu Xi believes this aligns with Zengzi escaping Confucius's words. "Prajna," or wisdom, aligns with the Analects' Li Ren chapter, which states, "The wise benefit from benevolence," and the Zi Han and Xian Wen chapters, which state, "The wise are not deluded."

### Portuguese Man Accused of Running Gambling Den: Portuguese Consulate Court Delivers Verdict - Carvalho Acquitted and Released

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Police Inspector Moore of the Shanghai Municipal Police and Deputy Inspector Blancart, some time ago, raided a gambling den in the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank building and arrested Portuguese citizen Carvalho, accusing him in the Portuguese Consulate Court of operating gambling. The Portuguese Consulate Court held a trial on Saturday and Sunday afternoon last week, presided over by Portuguese Consul-General and Judge Melo, with Mr. de Campos, Mr. Sequeira, and Mr. Souza serving as jurors. The defendant hired lawyer Ranchil to defend him. Inspector Moore and Mr. Blancart both appeared in court to recount the circumstances of the arrest. The consulate court lawyer also called a certain police officer and his wife from the Public Concession to testify, but their testimony was ineffective because the defendant's lawyer argued that the police officer and his wife were not independent witnesses. After the jury deliberated, they found the defendant not guilty, and Melo ordered Carvalho's release.

### Fire in Ronghua Lane: Water Shortage in the Lane

And Belated Report Leads to Tragedy

According to the authorities of the French Concession, some irresponsible newspapers, such as tabloids, have made inaccurate reports regarding the case of the fire in Ronghua Lane, Rue Massenet on the 7th of this month, which resulted in several deaths. The problem that caused the incident was the lack of water in the lane. The authorities of the French Concession have several points that should be brought to the attention of residents regarding the incident: (1) The "bull's head" (fire hydrant) does not belong to the lane. The water for firefighting is supplied directly by the company and is exclusively for the use of the Fire Brigade. (2) The French Concession has never restricted water usage. (3) Firefighters arrived on the scene to put out the fire immediately after receiving the report and did not feel any water shortage. At that time, because the fire was very large, eight large hoses were used to put out the fire. At that time, more than thirty workers were trapped in the fire, and the firefighters bravely rescued more than twenty-three of them. The reason why the fire could not be extinguished immediately was that the incident occurred at 5:00 AM, and the person responsible for the carelessness could not borrow a telephone, resulting in a belated report. (4) Although the destroyed factory had fire extinguishers and water bucket facilities, the fire spread too quickly, making it impossible to use them.

### Unexpected Calamity While Getting a Haircut

If he returned late, they would argue. On the night of the 10th, Zheng went out again and did not return until midnight, causing Sun to become dissatisfied and attempt suicide. She poisoned herself that night. It was not until noon the next day that Zheng discovered her. He sent her to the First Hospital of the Red Cross, but it was too late to save her.

Gathering the best works in one place, with non-selling items accounting for half, it is sufficient to promote the inherent culture and add luster to the people.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Special Education Committee Publishes Report (4): A Glimpse of the Recommendations

For ease of reference, the various recommendations are briefly listed below: (1) The educational responsibility of the Public Concession primarily belongs to the resident communities of various countries, and the decision rests with the Municipal Council. (2) The Municipal Council's educational policy should move towards expanding the subsidy system, increasing the number of schools for expatriates of various countries, and strictly limiting direct educational facilities. (3) The current restriction on educational funding should be clearly abolished, and sufficient funding should be temporarily allocated to maintain the educational work currently in progress. (4) The allocation of educational funding for Chinese, Japanese, and foreign schoolchildren should be proportional to the donations paid by residents of each nationality. (5) Once the financial situation improves, educational funding should be increased beyond the minimum amount stipulated in Section 3. The additional funding should be used in a way that facilitates the application of the principles included in Section 4. (6) The proposal to transfer existing Municipal Council schools to expatriate organizations, while logically consistent with the principles of Sections 1, 2, and 4, is not feasible under the current circumstances. (7) The allocation of subsidies can be freely handled by the Subsidy Subcommittee under more flexible conditions, to implement and support special education programs that benefit the entire Public Concession, and to assist existing schools. (8) Subsidies should not be given to for-profit schools. (9) Schools receiving subsidies may be inspected by the Education Department. (10) The direct expenses of Municipal Council schools should be offset as much as possible by tuition revenue, but without placing hardship on parents. (11) The position of Director of Education should be retained after the current Director retires.

Current System

All Municipal Council schools and educational administration maintain their high level of efficiency. The Director of Education is about to retire. After his retirement, whether his successor should be appointed or whether the position should be left vacant, with the Chinese and Western educational supervisors responsible for handling Chinese and Western schools and allocating subsidies respectively, all of this has been discussed by this committee. As a result, the committee believes that the position of Director of Education should be retained to manage educational affairs in general. Otherwise, once the organization and responsibilities are divided, the efficiency of internal administration and external management will be impaired. However, to save expenses, all foreign assistants in the Education Department could be abolished.

Regarding the subsidy system, the committee's views are as follows:

A. The committee authorized to approve subsidies should be given the freedom to dispose of subsidies under more flexible conditions, unrestricted by previous allocation methods, and to allocate a portion of the subsidies for special projects that benefit the public, such as:

(1) Rewarding and assisting independent organizations, charitable organizations, and individuals in establishing primary schools in areas of the Public Concession with insufficient school facilities.

(2) Establishing a basic hygiene course in primary schools for poor children.

(3) Cooperating with the Industrial and Social Affairs Department to conduct industrial and technical training.

(4) Adding special vocational training classes in secondary schools.

(5) Assisting schools in experimenting with improvements in teaching methods.

B. Subsidies should not be given to any schools whose purpose is to seek private gain.

C. Schools receiving Municipal Council subsidies, in addition to being inspected by the Health, Public Works, and Fire Departments, may be inspected by the Education Department.

Due to the decline in exchange rates and the rise in commodity prices, the cost of maintaining Municipal Council schools must increase. Therefore, the committee does not recommend any large-scale austerity measures. Eighty-two percent of the expenditure listed in last year's education budget was for the salaries of teachers and staff (including pensions). A large portion of these are bound by contracts, making it difficult to reduce them. Unless staff are laid off or salaries are reduced, expenses cannot be reduced. The implementation of layoffs must sacrifice efficiency, and salary reductions will affect the standards of appointing teachers and teaching. The committee believes that some savings can be achieved by replacing the Western principals of Chinese schools with Chinese personnel. The Municipal Council has already established this as a policy.

Regarding tuition fees, the committee believes that the direct expenses of Municipal Council schools should be offset as much as possible by tuition revenue, but without placing hardship on student parents.

Appendix: Memorandum from Chinese Committee Members to the Special Committee

(1) The Municipal Council has a moral obligation to provide educational facilities for the children of taxpayers (regardless of nationality), and from the perspective of overall social welfare, it is hoped that the Municipal Council will provide such facilities as much as possible. (2) The Municipal Council's current education policy has a dual approach:

(1) Establishing public schools. (2) Subsidizing private schools. The committee believes that this policy should not be changed in the future with regard to Chinese education. Municipal Council schools should serve as a model for private schools in terms of improving teaching methods and sound management. The subsidy system should aim to raise the standards of private schools. (3) The allocation of education funding between Chinese and Western schools should be more equitable. In any average allocation method, attention should be paid to two aspects: the amount of taxes paid by Chinese and foreigners and the number of enrolled children. (4) In the autumn semester of the year, the Municipal Council Chinese schools, including night schools, had a total of 8,479 registered students. According to the 1935 survey, there were 149,542 Chinese school-age children (between the ages of five and fifteen) in the Public Concession (excluding the area outside the concession roads). It can be seen that the Chinese school-age children attending Municipal Council schools account for only 5.7% of the total. As for the Western school-age children in the Public Concession, including the area outside the concession roads, according to the above survey, there were 5,405. In the autumn semester of last year, there were 1,287 registered students in the Western public schools, accounting for 35% of the total. From this, it can be seen that the Municipal Council has not assumed the primary responsibility for educating Chinese children. Therefore, the committee proposes that Chinese education funding should be increased and Chinese schools should be added to reach at least 10% of Chinese school-age children attending Municipal Council schools, in order to eliminate the above-mentioned inequality. (5) In 1934, education funding was stipulated not to exceed the income equal to 2% of the tax collection rate. This method has not been changed. When this principle was applied in 1935, the tax rate was 14%. But now the tax rate has been increased, so the above restriction rate should also be increased, at least to reach the previous ratio of 1/7. (End)

### A New Reason for Ideological Divorce

— Jiang Hong

If you go to Norway, which has already fallen, and hear a couple divorcing because of "political differences," don't be surprised. Because this has already been "officially announced."

Today, among couples in Norway, if one party does not support Hitler or Quisling, opposes Nazi philosophy, and opposes the Norwegian puppet regime, hoping for a British victory, the other party can immediately file for divorce.

This is certainly a "benevolent policy" for husbands or wives whose feelings have already broken down or who have new loves; however, a government that needs to use such means of controlling thought to make the people "content" only reveals the flaws in its ideology.

Looking further ahead, in history, it seems that no one has "ever seen before" those who can use armed force to stop social progress and permanently suppress the freedom of thought within the reasonable scope of the people.

Correspondance

### Xu Beihong in Southeast Asia

— Jie

In times of peace, the actions of some artists have long been noticed, but in times when the country is at war with foreign countries, they are actually even more missed. The famous painter Mr. Xu Beihong, in the first year of the outbreak of the war, moved to Chongqing with National Central University. When passing through Hankou, he was dragged by Guo Moruo and insisted on asking him to serve as the head of the Art Section of the First Hall of the Political Department. Professor Xu, dressed in a blue cloth shirt, felt somewhat out of place entering the heavily guarded armed zone. Therefore, he quietly slipped to Chongqing and returned to his old profession.

In the first year of the war (1938), Indian poet Tagore sent a telegram inviting Mr. Xu to teach at the Indian International University. On the way, he happened to encounter the fall of Guangzhou. The disruption of transportation trapped him in the Xijiang River basin for more than 40 days. Later, he finally detoured to Hong Kong and then took a boat to India. From then on, Professor Xu held four consecutive painting exhibitions in Singapore, Calcutta, and other places, selling all his old paintings for more than 500,000 yuan. He donated all the proceeds to refugees and overseas Chinese who were enthusiastic about their motherland. This was already well known. The exhibitions that Professor Xu held in Southeast Asia this time were all very successful. The most significant point was that "every penny was returned to the public." No wonder the overseas Chinese were greatly moved and actively contributed! Those exhibitions were:

In March 1939, a painting exhibition was held in Singapore, with an income of 13,700 Straits dollars, equivalent to more than 120,000 yuan in national currency.

In February 1941, a painting exhibition was held in Kuala Lumpur, with an income of 17,800 Straits dollars, equivalent to more than 150,000 yuan in national currency.

In March 1941, a painting exhibition was held in Ipoh, with an income of 10,000 Straits dollars, equivalent to more than 80,000 yuan in national currency.

In April 1941, a painting exhibition was held in Penang, with an income of 12,000 Straits dollars, equivalent to more than 100,000 yuan in national currency.

The total income from the above four painting exhibitions was nearly 500,000 yuan in national currency, setting an unprecedented record for the income of individual painting exhibitions by national painters. The reason for such achievements was obviously because Professor Xu's profound art had long been admired by people from all walks of life; the second reason was that the overseas Chinese were enthusiastic about loving their country and actively contributed; and the third reason was that Professor Xu insisted on donating all the income to refugees, while his personal travel expenses, living expenses, and the mounting costs of each painting were all raised by Professor Xu personally. This spirit has created a unique brilliance in the Chinese art world. Recalling the large couplet hanging in Professor Xu's studio, collected from the Stone Scripture of Mount Tai: "Unique prejudice, acting willfully," one can know Mr. Xu's character and his constant practice of doing what he says, not conforming to vulgarity, especially this kind of good deed of pleading for refugees, which further demonstrates his broad compassion.

In addition to these painting exhibitions, Professor Xu also held one solo exhibition each in Calcutta and the International University during his stay in India. The painting exhibition in Calcutta was even presided over by the 80-year-old poet Tagore himself, of course, the scene was unprecedented. Later, Professor Xu went to the Himalayas for a sketch trip and completed the large composition "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains" oil painting.

It is said that recently, the National Art Committee of the Ministry of Education has invited Professor Xu to serve as a standing committee member and is urging Mr. Xu to return to China to preside over the association's affairs.

Psychology

### Clothing Helps Psychological Health

— Jin Guang

Those who have read Ms. Ying's article "I Don't Look Like a College Student" in the "Free Talk" on May 10th are probably rarely unmoved and express sympathy for her. In this bustling city, it is really not easy to find many college students like Ms. Ying who only know how to work hard and do not seek to dress beautifully.

From a simple principle, I personally have no objection to Ms. Ying's proposition. However, from the perspective of human relationships, social customs, and psychological health, I think Ms. Ying's opinion is worth examining.

We can certainly laugh at those women who specialize in using permed hair, manicured nails, strange clothes, and high-heeled leather shoes as symbols of the "new era" and "progress." But we must know that: (1) human beings are always eager to gather; (2) although there are no clear regulations on the clothing and attire of various people in society, there are considerable divisions and distinctions in the invisible; (3) loneliness is unhealthy from the perspective of psychological health.

When you go to the road, you can see that this one is a worker, that one is a nanny, this one is an apprentice, that one is a dancer, this one is a student, that one is a businessman... Why? Because their clothing and attire can be recognized invisibly. In a group of modern women, would they not find it strange if a woman dressed in rural clothes suddenly appeared? In a group of detectives, could everyone get along with a beggar who was ragged and haggard? It would probably be very difficult; in addition to being a place to study, school should also be a place to make friends (of course, not referring to drinking buddies). It is not smart to sacrifice friends for the sake of distinctive clothing.

In the past, girls from seven or eight to a dozen years old always wore braids, while married women wore buns, which also had considerable regulations in the invisible. Now, although most women have cut their hair, the style of their hair often varies with age. It is as unpleasant for an old woman in her forties or fifties to keep a "childlike" hairstyle as it is for a three- or four-year-old child to have a "plane-like" perm. Being considered a monster because of the different hairstyle and therefore not getting along with people, and often feeling uneasy in the heart, this is also an unnecessary trouble.

Human beings are conservative, and changes in customs, changes in hairstyles, and even wearing a newly made dress often require considerable courage. At first, it is often felt unnatural, but over time it becomes comfortable. Of course, I don't want Ms. Ying to spend a lot of time and money to change into a "college student"; but within the scope of not violating the principle of simplicity, adapting to the environment, making yourself look more like a college student on the outside, and not giving up the beautiful soul, is more reasonable from the perspective of psychological health.

I think there is a big difference between "looking like a college student" and extravagance, and a pleasing appearance and a beautiful soul can be taken into account.

### One-Armed Rickshaw Puller

— Wei Yan

One day, at dusk, I hailed a rickshaw from the Public Concession to the French Concession. Because I had to rush to teach evening classes, I was afraid of being late. In the sound of a group of rickshaw pullers vying for a price, I agreed to a lower price and hurriedly sat down. I didn't know that after walking a few steps, I suddenly noticed that the rickshaw puller only had one hand pulling, and the other side was using a rope from under his arm to help on his neck. I was surprised and asked him why he only had one hand. Since one hand was broken, why did he still pull the rickshaw? Seeing that I had questions, he told me about his life while running. He said that he used to be a soldier, and he broke one of his hands because of a certain war. Later, the army disbanded, and he returned to his hometown to do some small business, and a family of several people barely survived. He didn't know that after a few years, the second war broke out again. He was found to have been a soldier before and fought in battles, so his whole family suffered. He held his young son with one hand and fled to Shanghai. He had no capital and no expertise. Because he had one hand, he charged less than others; but he would rather I take a few more trips so that his daily income could support both father and son. When I got out of the car, I gave him a little more money, and he refused three times before accepting it.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(8) Perceptible Friendship

When Yuan Shaowen sent Begonia to this hospital, although he did not tell people his real name and Begonia's real name, the doctors guessed that there must be a reason why such a young person suddenly suffered such a terrible knife wound on his face.

"This gentleman's wound is really troublesome. Even if it doesn't rot or fester, it may not be without scars, and that eye is still a big problem," said the doctor wearing glasses, frowning.

At the same time, the female nurse put a white pill into Begonia's mouth, but before she could bring a glass of cold water to his lips, the pill had already been spat out of the patient's mouth.

"I don't want to eat this"! He said firmly: "Doctor, please have mercy on me and give me some sleeping pills to drink"!

"Don't do this, Yuqin! Let's talk slowly"! Shaowen hurriedly lowered his head to comfort him.

"Taking this pill will make you feel no pain"! The doctor said.

Begonia closed his eyes quickly and bit his lips tightly.

"Brother, you're deliberately blaming me..."! Shaowen only said one sentence and then swallowed it. "Doctor, Miss", then turned around and said to the doctor and the female nurse standing opposite him: "Can you please go out for a while and let me enlighten my younger brother a few more words? Young people always get angry when they suffer losses; if they don't calm down first, taking medicine is useless. Right"?

The doctor smiled and took the nurse out.

"Brother", Shaowen stood straight in front of Begonia's bed, and regardless of whether his eyes were open or not, he said in an extremely sincere tone: (104)

### Firefighting Anti-Aircraft Gun Team

— Li Yi

Recently, the international situation has become increasingly tense, and the war zone has expanded. The American people are aware that if this continues, the war is likely to spread to the New World, so the mood for preparing for war is extremely warm. The Fire Brigade of Piston City, Maryland, in order to prevent problems before they occur, has specially organized a firefighting anti-aircraft gun team, installing anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns on the fire trucks. In the future, when war occurs, when fire trucks are irrigating areas that have been bombed and caught fire, the firefighting anti-aircraft team can cope with it easily.

### Recording Listening to Opera at Carlton

— Sick Dove

On the third day at the Carlton stage, the repertoire included Yan Xiaopeng's *Tie Long Shan* (Iron Cage Mountain), Zhang Yiyun's *Shisan Mei* (Thirteenth Sister), and Yan Jupeng's *Ma Cao Dai Changting* (Scolding Cao at Changting), all of which were carefully crafted. *Tie Long Shan* places the greatest emphasis on style, something that martial artists today see as a daunting task. Yan Xiaopeng is of a good height, but unfortunately his bone structure is not abundant enough, and he lacks presence. Although this play is an opening face play for martial artists, it is different from martial artists. It does not excel in martial arts but focuses on posture. The initial entry should be steady and skilled, and the gestures should be generous. Every move, every step, every leap, has prescribed dimensions and must be skillfully in accordance with the movements. The helmet and armor on the body should be kept from disorder. The person should be agile, quiet, and solemn, and should not lose the majesty of a great general at any point. The aura should be vigorous, the performance should be dignified, and the enunciation of the lines should be divided into three sections. The upper section uses a recessive tone to bring out the words from a calm state, gaining a heroic spirit to express his majesty. The middle section is purely practiced with middle qi, and the words burst out from anger, with not losing calmness as the principle. The last section uses a heart-felt tone, making the rhyme mournful. Only such lines can be called first-rate. This can be discussed with experts, but it is not for outsiders to talk about. Yan Xiaopeng learned this play from Ding Yongquan. The postures and lines are still not bad, only the qi and complexion are slightly weaker. *Shisan Mei* is a laborious play for female actors, also relying on lines, body movements, and expressions as three key elements. Zhang Yiyun was on stage for the first time, but she was surprisingly competent. Her Beijing dialect was excellent, and her emotions were all good. In the wedding persuasion scene, her delicate anger was just right, making people feel as if they were tasting a fruit of remonstrance, with a lingering aftertaste. In terms of expression, there were several places that secretly resembled her elder sister, probably due to what she had heard and seen. Her appearance was beautiful, and her height was moderate. Qing Feng has such achievements, which is really not easy. The final act of *Ma Cao* is Yan Jupeng's masterpiece. In the opening section, the original tune of "Ping Sheng Zhi Qi…" (Life's Ambitions…), the two words "Ping Sheng" (Life) are pulled high, full of the sound of the Tan school. The two words "Feng Yun" (Wind and Cloud) are very skillful. The word "Feng" has a plosive sound, and the word "Yun" is powerfully received. In the second scene, the second-sixth tune of "Ya Dang Chao" (Pressing Down on the Court), the singing becomes tighter and tighter. The three words "Ba Ba Ba" (Enough, Enough, Enough) are like rain hitting plantain leaves, clean and pleasant to listen to. The long passage of lines in the third scene is completed in one breath, especially the sentence "Jiu Feng Zhi Ji Qian Bei Shao" (A thousand cups of wine are too few when meeting a friend), each word goes high, and the enunciation is extremely clear. It is said that even a sage like Shu Yan could not avoid one or two incorrect words in this passage. In the last sentence, "Ming Zhi Shan You Hu Pian Xiang Hu Shan Xing" (Knowing there are tigers on the mountain, I prefer to walk on the tiger mountain), the word "Pian" (Prefer) is read correctly in the yinping tone. The fast board of "Xi Ri Li" (In the past), the rhyme is witty and the mouth is full of strength. The inverted board of "Gan Chen Dang Dao Mou Han Chao" (Treacherous officials conspire against the Han Dynasty) is sung high into the clouds. The following original tune is ordinary and unremarkable. The three drum rolls are extremely skillful, calm, and refined, with the sound of metal and stone, because his skills were taught by Chen Yanheng, which is naturally extraordinary. Looking at Jupeng's play as a whole, his singing is better than his acting, but a few of the exits can still be seen. When scolding Cao Cao and Zhang Liao, his eyes and face are all acting, which can well describe the scene of Mi Zhengping, who relied on his talent and arrogance at the time. Although his voice is narrow, the high notes are still clear, loud and easy to listen to, not losing the characteristics of the Yu school.

### Gu Lan Jun Awaiting Childbirth

— Xing

Gu Lanjun is already heavily pregnant. In "Home," she plays the role of a pregnant Juexin's wife. A big belly playing a big belly is quite interesting. Although "Home" has only been filming for half a month, in order to allow Lanjun to rest and await childbirth as soon as possible, the Guolian authorities are trying to start filming Juexin's wife's scenes as early as possible. It is reported that Lanjun's work on the film has been 19/20 completed, and it will be completed in two or three days. Thus, Lanjun's work under the silver screen will wait until after giving birth. "Home" is no less than her epoch-making work.

### Symphony of Film and Theater

— Bai Ding

Li Qinian's third work, "The Merry Widow," immediately won a lot of audience praise and restored her past glory because it was full of new and exciting situations. Originally, the Yi Hua authorities planned to shoot "Waterloo Bridge", but they were afraid that it would fail again due to not matching Li Qinian's personality. Therefore, in order to rival "The Merry Widow", they decided to shoot another film with the same theme. The title of the play has been internally decided as "Bandit Beauty", which will still be written by Ye Yifang, describing a social butterfly entering and leaving the nobility, subverting many gentlemen and comprador classes. In fact, she is a thief who steals valuable ornaments! At the same time, the director of "Bandit Beauty" has also been internally decided as Li Pingqian, the director of "The Merry Widow".

The Meicheng Company has decided to restart film production from next month. In the middle, there was a plan to shoot "Hong Xuanjiao", but it has now been abandoned. However, the plan for film production is still in active preparation. In order to cultivate newcomers, it has been decided to employ all newcomers who have never been on the stage or screen. Currently, dance queens Wang Lingling, Zhou Jin, and Li Guiqin have been discovered. The initial work is to train Mandarin and then rehearse the stage play "A Flock of Orioles Flying," to increase experience. As for the film script, Fei Mu is invited to write it and take on the directing duties.

Yue Feng obtained the title of "Romance Director" after the completion of "Spring Breeze Returns to Dream". He is now rushing to shoot another romance film, "Blue Sea and Blue Sky", in order to be shown at Huguang after "The Merry Widow". His next work has been decided to be "Waterloo Bridge of Qiujiang", and the heroine of the film will be Yuan Meiyun.

Tianfeng Theatre will perform Wu Ren's directed "Shanghai to Yue Xia" in the next issue, saying that it will be performed in various local dialects. In this way, after the Green Treasure Theatre put forward the slogan of civilizing drama and making drama, Tianfeng also followed suit in advocating the doctrine of civilizing drama in drama!

### Blood Rain of Exquisite Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter Eight: Fallen Flowers Intend to Follow the Flowing Water

I've long considered discussing this with Wang Yongtai, exposing their secrets. Perhaps tomorrow, I'll use this scented silk handkerchief as proof, press Wang Yongtai for an explanation, and advise him to deal with the adulterous woman and wanton wife swiftly, and to seek a better path. There are many beautiful women in the world, why must it be her? Xu Jing, having decided on this plan, placed the scented silk handkerchief in the drawer and closed his eyes to sleep. The next morning, he rose early, washed, and after breakfast, he took the scented silk handkerchief and went to Wang Yongtai's study. He saw Wang Yongtai sitting in a chair, gazing up at the ceiling, lost in thought. He quietly walked in, stood up straight, and called out, "Uncle." Wang Yongtai turned his face and saw Xu Jing. Usually, he would greet him with a smile, saying, "Nephew, please sit down," but today he ignored him, neither seeing nor hearing him, coldly indifferent. Xu Jing couldn't help but be stunned; his mouth wanted to speak but stammered, his feet wanted to advance but hesitated. Xu Jing was truly in an awkward situation. But then he thought, what did I come here to do? Regardless of Wang Yongtai's attitude, I should speak truthfully and directly. Perhaps something unpleasant has happened to him. So, he mustered his courage, took out the scented silk handkerchief, and handed it to Wang Yongtai on the table with both hands, saying resolutely, "Uncle, please listen. I have a very important and secret matter concerning this handkerchief that I must report to you. I offer my loyal advice, speaking from the bottom of my heart, and ask for your wise judgment." Xu Jing said these words, expecting Wang Yongtai to surely ask him about the reason, but who knew that Wang Yongtai would give him a cold laugh and shake his hand, saying, "No need to say it, I already know everything." Xu Jing was startled by these words, wondering how Wang Yongtai knew everything. Wang Yongtai continued, "An honest man does not do things in secret. You are a man of integrity, how can you not cherish yourself? You should not be confused by your nature, acting boldly and recklessly. Since you have committed a mistake, you should seek repentance to atone for your transgression. Why try to conceal your faults, wanting to cover up what is already exposed? You don't need to tell me anything." When Wang Yongtai said this, Xu Jing was greatly alarmed, knowing that Wang Yongtai had misunderstood him. How could he not defend himself? So, he said again, "Uncle, please allow me to explain the details, and you will understand that I have no other intention, but am entirely for your benefit." Wang Yongtai did not wait for him to finish speaking, but loudly said, "I already understand, why do you need to say more? You are young and have a long future ahead of you. Take care to live your life well. I cannot keep you here any longer, why say more?" After saying these words, Wang Yongtai flicked his sleeves, stood up, and walked out, presumably to the yamen.

### Abstract of the Philosophy of Vigorous Practice

— Zong Yu

The first priority in life is to eliminate obstacles, moving from recognition to adaptation, from adaptation to control, and from control to utilization. The second is to create happiness, taking the whole as a premise and small steps as a method. While it cannot make up for the flaws of reality, these flaws are precisely the object of continuous human effort.
