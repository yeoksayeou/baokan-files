The Land Tax and Food Groups established a special review committee for the proposal to convert land tax to payment in kind. Chen Qicai, Yan Jingan, Gan Jiyong, Zhu Ping, Huang Tong, and Weng Zhiyong were appointed as conveners, and provincial finance ministers and experts like Wan Guoding as committee members.

From Mr. Fox's speech, one could fully understand the active support of the United States for China. Mr. Deng also had concrete opinions on issues such as food. The proposals passed at the general assembly on the 20th included: (1) Minister Kong's proposal regarding adequate financial resources for county governments to consolidate county finances and facilitate the implementation of county administration; improving tax laws and systems; and the anti-smuggling work of materials and taxes should be coordinated by the Anti-Smuggling Department of the Ministry to unify anti-smuggling administration and effectively implement wartime economic policies; (2) Member Huang Weiguo's proposal to enrich the funds of local material procurement agencies and adjust procurement methods to maximize purchasing power and concentrate material resources for the benefit of the war effort; (3) Member Huang Zhongyue's proposal to consider abolishing or improving the branch offices of inland freight inspection to facilitate freight transport and benefit production; (4) Member Gui Jingqiu's proposal regarding the overall relief of material production in war zones; (5) Member Wan Guoding's proposal to create preliminary land registers using oral standard map systems to facilitate the management of land tax and its collection; and to implement land value increment tax simultaneously with the implementation of land value tax; (6) Member Meng Xianzhang's proposal to request the government to formulate a food policy for extraordinary times as soon as possible and strictly implement it to suppress grain prices and stabilize public sentiment; (7) Member Hu Mingkou's proposal that after land tax is turned over to the central government and converted to payment in kind, all military food should be supplied in full amount, and before implementation, the central government should统筹统给按照实数the grain prices and expenses for the portions purchased by provincial governments, except for disaster areas; (8) Minister Kong's proposal, for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of financial administration and concentrating the strength of financial personnel, to quickly coordinate the training of financial personnel nationwide to meet the needs of the war of resistance and national reconstruction; provincial and local banks should adhere to the central government's financial policies and effectively promote them to benefit the war of resistance and national reconstruction.

Chongqing: Fox, the American member of the newly established Stabilization Fund Committee, delivered a speech at the National Financial Conference convened here yesterday afternoon, stating that the United States is aware that it is aligned with China and the United Kingdom. The Stabilization Fund Committee's efforts for China's economy will naturally make a small contribution. The stabilization of currency relations will clearly greatly promote China's foreign trade, prevent speculation, and maintain the credibility of Chinese currency in all areas of circulation. We are handling this in the hope that the financial situation of the government and the perspective on implementing price controls and other related economic principles will have a beneficial impact on the international financial situation. However, the functions of this committee extend beyond the scope of currency relations. This committee is a symbol of friendship and cooperation between two free and independent nations. The great democratic country of the West feels pleased and fortunate to be able to cooperate with the great democratic country of the East. The extent of our success will be commensurate with our measurement of a part of our special work in currency and financial relations. If our work can contribute to strengthening the friendship between China and the United States, it will not be in vain, as it will enhance the democracy of both countries. We are well aware that China currently faces many difficult problems that need to be addressed. The establishment of the China Stabilization Fund Committee is for addressing various financial problems. However, if Chinese currency needs to be stabilized, the scope of economic problems that we must pay attention to will naturally be great, because the exchange value of Chinese currency will ultimately not exceed its purchasing power in the country. What we must pay attention to includes inflation, rising prices, the continued issuance of banknotes, food shortages, the need to increase production of military supplies and goods for the people, and transportation difficulties. We will provide prepared solutions, but our work will be greatly facilitated if we receive the full cooperation and assistance of all members of this conference. In the future, we will naturally request statistical information from various ministries and agencies of your government to assist in our research. We may from time to time suggest changes and modifications to the economic institutions in your country. These suggestions will be made only after careful study. We hope that they can all be put into practice. We can assure you that your opinions will be presented to the committee without hesitation. Our efforts are united, and we will not tolerate petty disputes, personal jealousy, or short-sighted reforms. During times of peace, civil servants in China and elsewhere can have the leisure to implement outdated methods and practices, but in today's wartime era, we cannot afford to allow them to exist any longer. We must apply new and more modern methods, even if it causes errors and unintentional mistakes. Leaders must have the vision and courage to implement taxes based on ability to pay. This tax system must be centralized in nature. Individual promotions must be based solely on merit and not on political connections or social status. Budget controls must have a well-organized and unified system. The complete transparency of national finances is a major characteristic of a democratic government. He has only been in China for a short time but has already gained some concrete impressions. The first and most important is that the Chinese people, despite severe obstacles and difficulties, are determined to fight to maintain their independence. The Chinese nation, if united and unwavering, cannot and will not be overcome. His second impression is that the national unity in your country is due to the existence of a true democratic relationship between the government and the people. His third impression is that China's resistance to aggression has not only not hindered economic and political progress, but has actually accelerated it. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)

Editorial

### Reassessing German-Soviet Relations

In the past week, the most notable international development has been, less so the increasing deterioration of relations between the United States and Germany, and more so the mysterious evolution of German-Soviet relations; because the former was already predestined, America's opposition to Germany was a clear and universally recognized fact, while the latter is a perplexing mystery. War, or further cooperation? This is almost the question that every observant person is eager to explore. Assuming that Germany and the Soviet Union do openly clash as has been recently rumored, future historians, when recording the recent two years of German-Soviet relations, will truly wonder what words to use to describe it appropriately, because in the short span of twenty-two months, the national relationship first transformed from mutual jealousy and scolding to a harmonious alliance with shared goals, and then from friendly allies to military adversaries. Such a "lightning-fast" diplomatic relationship is worthy of being a new record in the history of modern international diplomacy.

Regarding the question of whether Germany and the Soviet Union will go to war, people have been unable to reach a conclusion amidst the complex and even contradictory reports of recent days. However, Germany's deployment of troops to the border, the Red Army's holding of exercises, the mobilization of Romania and Finland, and the establishment of the German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship are all undeniable facts. When people usually comment on Soviet diplomacy, they habitually regard it as mysterious and unpredictable. In fact, recently, the Moscow authorities have remained tight-lipped about various external rumors, except for a "formal denial" issued by the news agency that is not entirely convincing, even newspaper commentary. Not even half a word can be seen. This inexplicable silence naturally makes people more suspicious. Because, in any country, when faced with such a major issue concerning national destiny, even if it is a rumor, those responsible for speech should at least comment or correct it. It is somewhat unreasonable for papers like Pravda and Izvestia not to write a single word. In this situation, we can only temporarily refrain from overstepping our bounds and making unwarranted conjectures about the future direction of the Soviet Union. Fortunately, as the situation becomes increasingly tense, the mystery of "Where is Moscow going?" will surely be revealed in less than half a month.

Regarding the Anglo-German situation, all trends are much clearer. Among them, Germany also has a mysterious and profound aspect, but it is limited to the question of the target of its future offensive. As for the fundamental policy, there is nothing obscure. Generally speaking, we can at least assert that Germany must continue to launch offensives to strike at Britain. At the same time, in view of the leap forward in American policy toward Europe, we are even more convinced that Germany must seize the time. Why? Because according to Hitler's war plan, he must defeat the British government before Britain obtains sufficient supplies from across the Atlantic, is able to seize air supremacy, and stabilize naval power. This is without doubt. Otherwise, the "great" achievements he has made in the past two years will be in danger of complete destruction and the abandonment of previous efforts. If he fails to defeat Central Kingdom as scheduled, he must at least ensure that Germany itself is able to match the combined strength of Britain and the United States in terms of resource acquisition and weapons production. In other words, assuming that Britain can obtain a certain number of aircraft, military equipment, merchant ships, food, and oil from the United States each month, Germany should at least seize a corresponding amount of the same materials from various defeated European countries or "other" sources, in order to avoid being outdone and allow Britain's combat power, especially air power, to gradually surpass it. Therefore, just from this point of view, although neither Britain nor Germany is carrying out any decisive battles in the current stage of the European war, they are both pushing forward with all their strength in a kind of competition, that is, a competition to "seize the time to enrich combat power." The British side is strengthening the assistance of various autonomous territories while promoting accelerated assistance from the United States. For Germany, one side is organizing the so-called "New European Order" to further exploit the defeated countries, and the other side is conducting a war of nerves against the Soviet Union, hoping to obtain more supplies from this "friendly country" without bloodshed, especially large supplies of food and oil.

Assuming that the above inference is still correct, what can be imagined at present is the "bargaining" between Germany and the Soviet Union. Of course, Hitler still "remains consistent": holding a pistol in one hand and handing over a "memorandum-style treaty or agreement" in the other, demanding that the Soviet Union sign it. If the Soviet Union refuses to comply, the first step will probably be to instigate Romania or Finland to begin the so-called movement to recover lost territories, in order to stimulate and困擾the Soviet Union, while he himself may as well hide behind the scenes and temporarily not directly break face with the Stalin government. This method may be similar to the trick that Japan used to instigate Thailand to make trouble with Vietnam. Assuming that the Soviet Union decides to respond with force, Germany will certainly secretly assist Romania and Finland in their operations. Assuming that the Soviet Union is unwilling to use force, or uses force but repeats the previous long and unsuccessful war against Finland, then Hitler can just step forward and act as a "mediator," thereby demanding a generous gift from Moscow.

However, no matter what actions Germany takes directly or indirectly against the Soviet Union in the future, it is only a means in the entire war, not an end, because Hitler's ultimate goal is still to enrich his own combat power in many ways in order to prepare for a long-term joint operation with Britain and the United States in the future. Therefore, in his negotiations with the Soviet Union, he will surely do everything possible to threaten and lure in order to avoid a real conflict as much as possible. This is not difficult to assert.支、average national burden, (C) Implementing the Prime Minister's land policy and food policy (6) Explain the reasons and effects of transferring land tax to central collection; (7) The relationship between the food problem and the war of resistance and national reconstruction should follow the Prime Minister's遗敎on food and resolve it thoroughly; (8) The government's implementation of food control is entirely for the benefit of the country and the people.

Chongqing: Chairman Chiang's speech at the opening of the National Financial Conference on June 16th was published today, stating that the Chinese government will collect from landlords ten to twenty percent of the grain they produce, and may issue food bonds so that China can have a sound food production program. Food bonds are purchased with rice, wheat, or other grains instead of money, and the government will also repay with various grains when due. The Chairman emphasized that the current problem is not how much grain the government should purchase to supply the consumption of the military and civilians, but how to implement Sun Yat-sen's food policy. The Chairman warned wealthy landlords not to be stingy with ten to twenty percent of their harvest to pay land tax. The Chairman pointed out the plight of Chinese landlords in the occupied areas. The Chairman also said that the Chinese government, in a life-and-death situation, will not hesitate to adopt harsh measures to collect the grain. The Chairman also stated that the new county system will be promoted throughout the country to promote autonomy and balance the government's budget, while also balancing the people's tax burden. The Chairman also said that the Financial Conference is closely related to the current Pacification Conference and expressed the hope that the two conferences will cooperate to resolve the urgent problems of wartime finance and economic construction.

### Many U.S. Army Pilots Approved to Resign and Join Chinese Air Force; Although U.S. Law Has Restrictive Clauses, Government Clearly Emphasizes Established Facts

United Press, Washington, 21st - Government sources today declined to criticize the law passed by Congress in 1860, which is said to be a legal obstacle for American citizens to join the Chinese Air Force. Government officials said they were unaware of this law and pointed out that no one has yet requested the enforcement of this law. According to the federal law of 1860, it is prohibited for Americans to join the Chinese Air Force. The case authorizes the American Minister (now Ambassador) to forbid people from enlisting, and if necessary, may ask the U.S. Navy Department to help him carry out this matter. The legal rights of the American Minister are currently enforced by the American Court in China. It is recalled here that in 1937, many American pilots arrived in China, but in the end they were unable to join the Chinese Air Force because of this. Well-informed sources pointed out that many U.S. Army pilots have applied to resign and join the Chinese Air Force. They said that the implementation of this move has not taken into account legal issues. In theory, the enforcement of this law must be proposed by the Ambassador, but so far the U.S. Ambassador to China has clearly not been instructed to enforce this law. Federal government officials said they would rather not investigate the truth of this law than make the trouble of requesting an amendment to the law. If there are no special policies and reasons that must enforce this law, the government will not be condemned for not being able to enforce this law, and the government is particularly unwilling to amend this case to avoid the isolationists from obtaining an excuse for attack. Federal authorities may continue to regard this matter as an "established fact" rather than a "legal issue."

Havas News Agency, New York, 20th - Regarding the question of "whether the United States should hold a referendum before sending an expeditionary force to fight overseas," the American Institute of Public Opinion recently solicited opinions from the public. It is reported that 56 percent of the votes cast were in favor, and 44 percent advocated that there is no need to hold a referendum.

### President Roosevelt Sternly Reprimands Germany; Sinking of American Ship is an Act of International Outrage; The Use of the High Seas Cannot Be Abandoned; Vigorous Language in Special Message to Congress

Reuters, Washington, 21st. President Roosevelt did not propose retaliatory measures to Congress regarding the German submarine sinking of the American ship Robin Moor, but last night issued a:

Special Message

To Congress. It is explained that in a message the President can use vigorous language and freely express his opinions, unlike formal diplomatic documents which should be worded more moderately. In this message, the President did not indicate any steps the U.S. government intends to take to protect American ships at sea, lest Germany anticipates whether the U.S. will arm its merchant ships or send warships to escort them. The President stated that the U.S. does not intend to abandon the use of the high seas to Germany and referred to the sinking of the American cargo ship by a German submarine as a reckless act of international outrage. The President said that the general purpose of this act by Germany is to eliminate American commerce that may be deemed detrimental to German plans from the oceans, and its specific purpose is to obstruct our trade with friendly nations. We must regard this as Germany having made known that American ships or goods, no matter where they are on any ocean, will not be immune from piracy. In effect, we have been notified that Germany intends to threaten the U.S. so that we no longer pursue our established policy of aiding Britain's survival. In short, we must view the sinking of the Robin Moor as a warning that the U.S. must not resist Germany's conquest of the world, and as a warning that the U.S. cannot use the world's high seas unless it obtains Nazi consent. If we comply with this, then we directly acknowledge that the power to dominate the world is in the hands of Germany's current leader. We

will not submit to it now, nor do we intend to submit to it. When the Robin Moor was attacked, no arrangements were made to ensure the safety of the passengers and crew. The ship flew its flag and had markings identifying it as an American vessel, which the German submarine commander certainly knew. Moreover, the submarine had neither a flag nor declared its nationality. In sum, the German submarine's sinking of the American ship is a flagrant violation of the American ship's right to freely navigate the seas, subject only to the rights of belligerent nations as defined by international law. The German government knows that these rights do not include the deliberate sinking of merchant ships and the abandonment of passengers and crew to the perils of the sea. International law explicitly requires that passengers and crew be placed in a safe place. The fact that the American passengers were rescued by chance cannot mitigate the savage crime of forcing them to drift in lifeboats on the ocean. This disregard for the most basic principles of international law and humanity makes the sinking of the Robin Moor an act of international outrage. The U.S. government holds Germany responsible for this violent and indefensible sinking of an American ship, and the German government must compensate for all losses suffered by Americans. The Robin Moor's passengers and crew drifted in small lifeboats at sea for two or three weeks before being rescued by a passing friendly ship. The U.S. government believes that freedom from violence and inhumane treatment is a

natural right, which cannot be arbitrarily disregarded by those who temporarily find themselves in a position to use force against defenceless people. If this incident could be viewed as meaningless, the situation would not be so serious. However, this matter must be interpreted in light of the publicly announced and actively implemented methods of terror and intimidation that Germany has historically used as tools of international policy. The U.S. government can only assume that the German government hopes to intimidate the U.S. and other countries through these disreputable acts against helpless and innocent men, women, and children, into taking a path of non-resistance to Germany's plans for world conquest. Germany's method of conquering the world involves unlawful violence on land and piracy on the seas. Germany's current methods against the U.S. are entirely consistent with the terror methods traditionally used by Germany's leaders. However, Germany's leaders should know that the U.S. will neither be intimidated nor will it acquiesce in Germany's current leader's plan to dominate the world. We have reason to believe that the Robin Moor case is one step in anti-American actions and is consistent with its actions against other countries. We cannot rely on official declarations to the contrary, as the German government has issued the same statements, declarations, and solemn promises to many countries. The first of these statements was when the German government, after seizing Austria by force, admitted that its

desire for land

had already been satisfied. Evidence that the German government continues to plan to conquer countries and dominate the world leaves no room for doubt. From this perspective, the sinking of the Robin Moor is a revelation of German policy and its methods. Hence, the unlawful violence of the past was a prelude to a plan of conquest on land, and today's event is clearly the first step in Germany's intention to seize control of the high seas. It cannot conquer Britain without seizing this right.

Reuters, Washington, 21st. The first reaction to President Roosevelt's message to Congress is that the President, in his past fireside chats or when announcing policies, has never launched such a fierce attack on Germany and its methods as in this message. The most important passage is the phrase that American ships will encounter piracy on any ocean. The President's utterance of these words is tantamount to announcing to Congress and the public that Germany is now, at the very least, at sea

Waging war on the U.S.

Qualified observers recognize this message as extremely important in developing American policy and enlightening the American people. This message prepares the public for a final stand, which is now anticipated by everyone. Everyone knows that words and protests cannot prevent Germany from repeating its desired actions, so they believe that this message contains greater significance than what is revealed on the surface. The President's statements that the U.S. will neither surrender nor intends to surrender, and that German official declarations are absolutely unreliable, imply that the U.S. will soon take some kind of action. As a matter of course, the U.S. will send a formal and stern protest to Berlin, but it is expected that America's future actions may not depend on Germany's response. According to the first guesses here, American merchant ships may soon be armed. Defense Production Committee member, Democratic Senator Pepper, called the President's decisive message the opening act of a declaration of war, saying that he highly agreed with the President's views and that he believed the American people felt the same way. Democratic Senator Truman also stated that he agreed with the President's assertion that the sinking of the American ship was an act of piracy, but Republican Congressman Jenkins said that he was pleased that the President did not request a declaration of war.

### Germany Freezes American Funds; Sees it as a Wartime Measure; Germany and Italy Demand U.S. Close Consulates; French Interests Directly Affected

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 21st. Regarding the U.S. freezing of the funds of German and Italian nationals in America, a German foreign ministry spokesman commented that this is a kind of wartime measure by the U.S. government. Previously, when the U.S. froze the funds of German-occupied countries, it still gave excuses, claiming its actions were justified, but this decision offers no explanation. This measure by the U.S. violates the trade treaty signed between Germany and the U.S. on December 8, 1923, which stipulates that both countries treat each other's nationals under most-favored-nation status. This aggressive measure by the U.S. is based on the principle of nationality and territory, so all funds belonging to German and Italian nationals are included. This is an attempt to use the American blockade of funds to assist Britain's blockade of Europe, but this measure by the U.S. will also greatly harm American interests. After London lost its position as the world's economic center, many people thought that New York could succeed it, but this development will inevitably fail because the owners of the frozen funds will never forget America's illegal measures. Berlin believes that this measure by the U.S. will gradually divide international economic investment into eastern and western hemispheres. Germany is not afraid of this. The German funds frozen in the U.S. are estimated to be 110 million marks, while German securities and the balance of barter trade with the U.S. are minimal and not worth mentioning. As for the assets of German businesses in the U.S., they have long been sold. On the other hand, the U.S. funds frozen by Germany in Germany amount to 1.7 billion marks, far more than Germany's losses, so this measure by the U.S. is actually harmful and not beneficial to the U.S.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 21st. Regarding the German government's request that the U.S. authorities close American consulates and express delivery companies in Germany and occupied territories, a German foreign ministry spokesman commented that such measures should have been implemented long ago, so this matter cannot be seen as Germany taking retaliatory measures. The German authorities had already discovered that the employees of these American institutions were providing German news to the British intelligence agency, with the method being to relay it to Britain via Washington. German files are filled with such evidence, but Germany, out of generosity, was unwilling to take harsh measures. It was only after the U.S. violated international norms, closed German consular agencies in the U.S. without sufficient reason, that the German government abandoned this generous attitude and took this completely reasonable action.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 21st. Haitong News Agency announces that its New York branch has ceased operations.

Havas News Agency, Vichy, 20th. The governments of Germany and Italy have requested that the U.S. close all consulates in Germany, Italy, and German-occupied territories. However, it is noted that French interests in Germany, Italy, and German-occupied territories have been looked after by American consulates since the outbreak of the current European war. Therefore, France has also been directly affected by this measure.

### U.S. Orders Closure of Italian Consulates

Reuters, Washington, 21st. The U.S. has ordered the closure of all Italian consulates. All consular staff must leave the country by July 15th.

United Press, Rome, 21st. U.S.-Italian relations have become even more strained today following the official announcement that American consulates throughout Italy have been closed due to the attitudes and actions of U.S. consular officials causing serious opposition from Italians. People in Rome have repeatedly expressed yesterday that the aspects of American actions that cause Italian opposition are feared to be not limited to consular officials. Many depositors fear that due to the closure of consulates, the Italian freezing of American deposits will only intensify and not relax. Even matters stipulated in official orders as being exempt from certain deposit freezing restrictions, such as matters concerning residents and special circumstances, will be forever impossible to execute.

### Dutch East Indies Governor Hosts Farewell Banquet for Ayazawa

Reuters, Batavia, 21st. Last night, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies hosted a farewell banquet for Ayazawa, the chief Japanese representative for economic negotiations. Due to the suspension of negotiations, Ayazawa is scheduled to return to Japan on the 27th of this month.

### U.S. President Announces Control of Petroleum; Japan and the Soviet Union Included in Embargo; Peru Bans Export of Raw Materials

United Press, Washington, 20th. President Roosevelt yesterday placed all U.S. petroleum production under strict export control. This is the strictest measure to embargo this supply. This order follows the recent announcement that the eastern coastal provinces are experiencing a severe oil shortage due to a lack of tankers. Under the President's oil embargo order, Japan, the Soviet Union, and other countries, except in particularly unavoidable cases, must obtain export licenses before obtaining any U.S. petroleum products. All ports on the east and west coasts can therefore arbitrarily request an embargo. This order will currently apply to the embargo of petroleum on the eastern coast, with Britain, Egypt, and Latin America being exceptions. The President's order stated that "the embargo of petroleum from the Gulf of Mexico or U.S. Pacific ports has not been considered," but as petroleum production has been entirely subjected to export control, the President will naturally establish a mechanism for this kind of prohibition. The Japanese recently attempted to obtain 252,000 gallons of oil in Philadelphia but were stopped by Ickes, the National Petroleum Coordinator. It is generally believed that the President's order aims to curb the possibility of future oil transport from the eastern coast.

### Surprising Developments in the Current Situation; Germany and the Soviet Union May Reach a New Agreement; Negotiations Between the Two Sides are Clearly Underway; German-Turkish Cooperation Has a Significant Impact on the Soviet Union

Reuters, Zurich, 21st. According to sources here, there are rumors in Berlin that the German Reichstag will soon be convened. These rumors have not been confirmed, but if this is the case, it may be related to surprising developments. Political observers here generally believe that Germany does not want to go to war with the Soviet Union, but hopes to establish an agreement with it to maintain strict neutrality in future wars. It is possible that such an agreement has already been concluded, or perhaps it is only in the process of negotiation.

Reuters, Stockholm, 21st. A dispatch from Berlin reports that it is expected that Hitler will soon meet with the Soviet ambassador to Germany, Dekanozov. The Soviet ambassador has visited the German Foreign Ministry three times this week, once meeting with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and the other two times being received by German Foreign Ministry State Secretary Weizsäcker. At the same time, Berlin officials still say they do not know if Soviet-German negotiations have yielded any results.

Central News Agency, London, 21st. Reliable sources have recently stated that Germany has indicated to the Turkish government its willingness to cede a narrow strip of land belonging to Greece in Thrace to Turkey. This narrow strip of land is inhabited by a large number of Turks. Authorities here consider this news to be very important and believe it confirms reports that Hitler considers the German-Turkish non-aggression pact signed on Wednesday to be a tool to force Turkey to recognize Germany's power. It is generally believed that Germany's offer to Turkey is consistent with the German strategy of achieving its goals through threats and inducements. If diplomatic experts believe that the report of Germany concentrating more than 100 army divisions and large air forces near the Soviet border is intended not only to obtain concessions from Moscow, but also to restrain Turkey so that it will follow its wishes and prevent the Red Army from acting, making it impossible for the Red Army to interfere. It is generally believed that Germany is also trying to find a way for Turkey to allow German troops and military supplies to pass through Turkish territory. If Germany does not take advantage of the Turkish coastal base and the Dardanelles Strait, it will try to achieve the goal of transit through Turkish territory. If German troops pass through Turkish territory, they can make a fan-shaped advance through France, Iraq, and Syria, so as to approach the Suez Canal from the northeast. When the motorized and mechanized forces at the axis of the Western Desert launch an offensive against Alexandria and the Suez Canal, the troops approaching the Suez Canal from the northeast can echo the Western Desert Army. If Turkey allows Germany to establish air force bases in the Black Sea, it can bomb the Baku and Grozny oil fields from a very short distance. This will become a serious problem for the Soviet Union. The advantage of Germany and Turkey in the Dardanelles Strait and the Black Sea makes it possible to threaten the center of the Soviet oil-producing region and affect its entire economic strategy. In forcing Turkey to submit, Hitler also tried to curb the Soviet Union's counter-action. Experts are assessing the criticality of the German troops concentrated in the direct lines from Finland to the Caspian Sea from this perspective and in view of the reported German demands on the Soviet Union. There is still no proof of news about demands to the Soviet Union. According to British officials, if this news includes the so-called German engineers who can transform Soviet industry and transportation, German-Soviet involvement in the adjustment of Ukraine, or Germany using Soviet ports and shipyards and submarine plants, then Stalin will definitely give a definite answer. People here recognize the possibility of a new agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, especially on the economic front and the Soviet Union's agreement to increase oil and wheat supplies to Germany, and fear that Hitler and Stalin may discuss dividing spheres of influence in the Middle East.

Soviet Red Army Conducts Combat Exercises on the Finnish and Soviet Border

United Press, London, 21st. Moscow Radio last night announced that multiple Red Army units yesterday held military exercises in the area where the previous Soviet war against Finland took place. The location of this exercise is not far from the site of the previous German war against Poland. The broadcast stated, "The most elite units have been drawn from the Red Army and assigned special missions. This exercise includes all soldiers, wading through water to make a 130-mile advance, and engaging in simulated war with 'enemy' tank convoys and cavalry units at night." The broadcast also quoted a statement from the Red Army newspaper "Red Star," saying that this exercise is extremely important because it puts the Red Army in a position of true war.

United Press, Helsinki, 21st. Refugees who fled to Finland from Estonia said that Soviet officials have established a zone of destruction on the German and Lithuanian border, 60 miles wide, to prevent foreign invasion. Residents in several areas along the coast of Bove have been evacuated, all railways and bridges have been destroyed, and all houses and villages in the zone of destruction have been bombed. It was also said that recently, the Soviets arrested many "inferior" people in the territories of the former Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia.

Rumor That Germany Attempts to Use the Soviet Far East Fleet

United Press, Washington, 21st. Yesterday, it was widely rumored here that Germany has requested Moscow to cede the Soviet fleet stationed in Vladivostok to Germany for use in the Pacific War. The Soviet Far East Fleet is reported to include 50 destroyers, 80 submarines, and other small warships. Some neutral observers believe that Germany's greatest hope of victory lies in winning the Battle of the Atlantic, and say that even if Soviet warships join forces with Japan in the Pacific Ocean to prevent the U.S. Pacific Fleet from being transferred to the Atlantic, it would be of great help. The Soviet fleet can be used as raiding vessels to deal with British ships. Experts also say that another military request from Germany is that the Soviet Union stop its aid to China, so that Japan has extra power to attack the British and Dutch territories in Southeast Asia.

### British Artillery Heavily Bombards Damascus; Australian Troops Advance Towards Beirut Encountering Stiff Resistance from Vichy Forces

Reuter, Beirut, 21st – British artillery began shelling the Mohajerin district of Damascus yesterday afternoon, after British, Indian, and Gurkha troops penetrated the outskirts of the city.

Reuter, Cairo, 21st – British headquarters announced last night that British and Free French forces continued their attacks on Damascus and Beirut yesterday.

Free French forces south of Damascus were subjected to heavy counterattacks by large numbers of enemy troops but managed to hold their positions.

Reuters, Cairo, 21st – Fighting of varying intensity is taking place on all fronts in Syria. Australian troops advancing along the coastal highway from Sidon towards Beirut are encountering stiff resistance from Vichy forces.

After the British and Indian troops launched their attack, they captured 560 enemy soldiers, including 210 Germans. They have now penetrated deep into the enemy lines and reoccupied the positions they held for the past three months. A major sandstorm is currently raging in the Western Desert, bringing fighting almost to a standstill, and air activity is minimal.

### Youth Association College Entrance Guidance Lecture Series Fourth Day (2)

General Situation of Jiaotong University

Following that, Jiaotong University student Li Yiqin introduced the general situation of the school, saying that the school site was occupied after the war, which greatly affected teaching. The first and second grades are currently taking classes in the new Zhen Dan school building, while the third and fourth grades are taking classes on Aimeiyuyu Road, and the laboratories are scattered in three or four places. In terms of organization, it was originally divided into five colleges: Management, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Science. Later, in accordance with the Ministry's order, it was changed to three colleges. In fact, only the three colleges of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Civil Engineering were merged into one college, called the College of Science and Engineering. The College of Management is divided into the Railway Department (30 places are enrolled this year), the Industrial Department (10 places are enrolled, which is difficult to enter), and the Finance Department (20 places). Famous professors include Zhong Weicheng, Li Binghua, and An Shaoyun. The College of Science and Engineering is divided into the Department of Mechanical Engineering (40 places are enrolled this year, divided into three majors: automobile, train, and power), with famous professors such as Hu Duanxing and Chen Shiying. The Department of Electrical Engineering is divided into two majors: Communications and Power, with famous professors such as Cui Zhaolin and Zhang Tingjin. The Department of Civil Engineering is divided into four majors: Architecture, Highway, Railway, and Municipal Engineering, with famous professors such as Gu Kangle and Li Shuhe. The College of Science is divided into three departments: Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry (more difficult). As for students' extracurricular activities, some people criticize them as "very rigid." This is not entirely true, because before the war, the environment was free, the school building was spacious, and student activities were very popular. The school's Youth Association will open a "Welcome New Students Conference" before the start of the term to welcome new students. Also, the tuition fee of the school is the lowest among Shanghai universities, at only ten yuan per semester. The government subsidizes each student with 700 yuan per year. The entrance examination is as follows: The College of Management accounts for 20% of Chinese, 15% of English, 15% of Mathematics, 10% of Science, 15% of Chinese and Foreign History, 15% of Chinese and Foreign Geography, 5% of Civics, and 5% of Biology. The College of Science and Engineering and the College of Science are the same, with 15% of Chinese, 15% of English, 20% of Mathematics, 15% of Physics, 15% of Chemistry, 10% of Chinese and Foreign History and Geography, 5% of Civics, and 5% of Biology. There is also a non-unified examination, and those with a score of less than 25 in one subject will not be admitted. For Chinese, composition should be in classical Chinese, and ancient people should not be attacked. The topics often come from the Four Books. English emphasizes newspaper editorials, which have contemporary significance, and the grammar learned should be mostly useless. For the science and engineering college, mathematics focuses on analytic geometry (emphasis), algebra (second), and trigonometry (third), but sometimes the questions are mixed. There are many small questions in chemistry, and the answers should be as detailed as possible. Geography focuses on inland transportation after the war, history focuses on modern history, and chemistry focuses on differential chemistry. The registration date for the school is from July 20 to 22, and the examination is from July 28 to 31. The brochure has not yet been printed.

### Food: The False Claim That the Public Works Department Has Determined That Rice Will Not Continue Incites Rice Prices to Soar; Fortunately, This Rumor Will Probably Be Exposed Soon

Yesterday, the market for foreign rice showed signs of strength again, and rumors arose, confusing people and causing chaos in the market. However, the publicly sold Hong Kong rice at a flat price of 110 yuan continued to be sold widely. Since the Public Works Department is responsible for maintaining stability from the beginning, it will inevitably continue to stabilize it in the future. The public can rest assured and let speculators manipulate the market and suffer the consequences again. However, after the market opened in the morning, purchases by various domestic Shantou merchants caused the market to suddenly show strength, and both spot and futures prices of rice rose uniformly, rising by two or three yuan compared to the previous day. Especially the Yinghua Company was popular, with No. 1 Saigon original packages reaching 147 yuan, small polished rice calling for 146 to 147 yuan, broken rice 115 yuan, and July rice 112-113 yuan. In the afternoon, there were even more rumors, claiming that the Public Works Department's previous quota of 3,000 tons of small polished rice, except for 500 tons actually approved, had 2,500 tons for which the reply telegram was not transferred, and that it would be even more difficult to access in the future. As a result, people became more agitated, and small polished Yinghua Company immediately reached 150 yuan, spot market prices reached 105 yuan per shih, and No. 1 Saigon reached 130 yuan per shih, soaring and unstoppable. People's minds and the market became even more chaotic and unclear. The total transaction volume for the day was 30,000 bags and 2,000 tons. The closing prices were No. 1 Saigon at 106 yuan, No. 2 at 119.5 yuan, No. 1 Siam at 105 yuan, extra-pointed at 131 yuan, No. 2 Gao at 100 yuan, Jue at 118 yuan, Jiafo rice at 103-104 yuan, Mindang at 103 yuan, small polished Pudong Wharf at 101 yuan, Puxi Wharf at 100.5 yuan, Tokyo Pointed Gao from 114 yuan to 108 yuan, Mi Lu at 106 yuan, broken pointed rice at 97 yuan to 95 yuan, and No. 3 broken rice at 85 yuan, a rebound of two or three yuan compared to the previous closing price.

However, more foreign rice from the Public Works Department has arrived in Shanghai. The Yihua Shipping Company's Minsheng vessel arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, loaded with 10,000 bags of foreign rice from the Public Works Department from Hong Kong, and stopped at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. (Zu)

Thick and thin japonica rice. At this time of moldy weather, the rice quality cannot withstand storage. In the past, this was the peak season for supply. However, as times have changed, the situation is different, and it is no longer the norm. Arrivals are less than usual, and may even be interrupted. Yesterday, unexpectedly, it poured into the port, with no less than 400 shi of early and late rice from the Nangang area, setting a new record for the source of japonica rice in this year. As a result, the market was immediately affected. Although foreign rice rose again, it could not rise with it. Sellers were more willing to sell, and the sales market felt even more depressed, depreciating by one or two yuan. Fresh early and late rice from Kainangang opened at 133-134 yuan, and medium-grade rice was only 131 yuan to 130.5 yuan. Original packages and old goods were not traded. As for original packages of old japonica rice from Wuxi, in this environment, it was inevitably implicated and depreciated slightly, opening at 106 yuan.

The market for glutinous rice had little stock, and at a time when foreign rice was tightening, the market seemed to be able to rise. However, the outlet was not smooth, with only some retail demand from food stalls, etc., so the selling price was difficult to raise, and it remained stable. The opening prices for both domestic and foreign goods were similar to before.

### The Flour Market's Rising Trend is Even More Severe

The price of foreign flour has been rising continuously. Since the price increase started on Tuesday of this week, each bag has increased by 1.5 to 2 yuan, and the rising trend is quite rapid. This is due to many problems with overseas supply, and this year's new wheat harvest has been poor and subject to strict control. The raw materials for Chinese factories will not be able to continue, and flat-price flour will inevitably be discontinued. Therefore, people are invariably looking upwards, and the hoarding wind has revived, causing the market to rise steadily. At the opening in the morning, Jinlong Flour was raised to 32.1-32.2 yuan in the buying frenzy. It slightly declined in the middle, once entering Customs. In the afternoon, with the buying momentum picking up again, Jinlong Flour rose again to a new high of 32.4 yuan. Paotai Flour rose to 33-33.3 yuan, an increase of about 1 yuan from the previous day. Fushou Brand and Dangtian Brand were also priced at 32.4 yuan. In the evening market, it rose again to 32.7-32.8 yuan. About 30,000 bags were transacted.

There was no trading in wheat because the new wheat was subject to strict control and could not come to Shanghai, and the price in the mainland also increased with the price of Shanghai flour, making transportation even more difficult. Therefore, there was no import or export in the market, and it is feared that it will be difficult to develop for a while.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Corn, Soybean Oil, All Rising

Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes was dominated by the trend of the rice market, and prices rose again and again. General hoarding stomachs "grabbing hats, kicking the ball and bee" activities, corn prices fell by 1.6-1.7 yuan the day before, yesterday's market rebounded by 1.8 yuan, with more than 2,000 bags transacted. Saigon mixed new corn was priced from 25.5 yuan to 27 yuan, and all old corn from 25.5 yuan to 26 yuan, Dutch white corn from 28 yuan to 28.8 yuan, and yellow corn from 29 yuan to 30 yuan. There was no development in soybeans. Peanut oil and soybean oil rose again by 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan. The price of Dasu soybean oil was from 176.5 yuan to 179 yuan, with 150 barrels transacted. Hankou soybean oil was 80 barrels, priced at 178 yuan. Dayou Factory soybean oil was 200 dan, priced at 130 yuan, and Qingdao peanut oil was 30 barrels, priced at 182 yuan. Spot and futures prices for soybean cakes diverged. Spot cakes fell by 0.4-0.5 yuan due to sluggish sales, while futures prices rose along with other rising winds, resulting in an increase of 0.3-0.4 yuan from the previous day. Detailed prices are listed in the price column. The market will be closed for the summer break in the afternoon, which is scheduled from July 1 to August 15.

Exports on the 22nd: 870 bags of soybeans, shipped to Hong Kong; 7,440 pieces of soybean cakes, shipped to Hong Kong.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Remains Stable

The black market for British and American exchange rates tightened first and then returned to flat, due to rumors that an American submarine had been sunk by the Germans. Chinese merchants and speculators came to strongly buy American dollars, softening them to 5.40625 yuan. British gold was also slightly higher, only 3 pence 3125, by the Guangdong merchants. Near noon, negative news suddenly emerged, and speculators turned to sell. Japanese banks also offered to sell, so the tightening trend returned to flat.

### Gold Market Fluctuates Uneasily; Spot Prices Also Fall Slightly

Yesterday's gold market fluctuated greatly in the black market, rising first and then suddenly falling. After breaking through the 6,400 yuan mark twice, it returned. People's minds changed from firm to tired. At noon, rumors suddenly arose that an American submarine had been sunk by the Germans. Therefore, although Finland mobilized and the tense atmosphere between Germany and the Soviet Union intensified, the foreign exchange returned from tight to half, and the buying interest of gold shops and Guangdong merchants weakened. Shanghai West Gang suddenly came out, so after the price rose to 6,413 yuan, it sharply retreated to 6,373 yuan before noon, and finally squeezed up a small three yuan. The transaction volume for half a day was 15,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday, and jewelry gold, etc., remained flat. Cash Mingyan was sold to Shunyuan for ten taels, and the price was 350 yuan higher than the futures transaction, squeezing past a slight drop. June futures rolled over to July, and the seller posted 55 yuan to the buyer.

Shihe came to sell, and retailers sold small amounts to 6,382 yuan when they saw the high. Suddenly, it was heard that American dollars were difficult to settle at 5.4375 yuan, and people's minds were shaken.

Hesheng, Yiyuan, Dafeng, Deda, and Xinyuan sold, and retreated to 6,388 yuan.

### Securities: Public Debt Buyers Emerge

The black market for public bonds, although the rumors had no basis, was easily affected at high prices yesterday. Yesterday should have been optimistic, but some bulls emerged and sold. Although there were not many sales, the buyers felt discouraged and the market price showed a slight setback. Yesterday was Saturday, and only one session was held in the morning. At the opening at 11:00 AM, the opening price was slightly higher due to the continued demand from Xinfu, but Yichang and Lemao sold the most. Datong bought in, and Xiekang also sold out. The Class C two-yuan market went in and out several times, but it still broke the closing price. However, the trading volume was small and the fluctuations were limited. As a result, except for Class D, which was not traded, the rest were slightly lower by one to three jiao. The transaction volume was 1.2 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

### Yarn and Cotton: Long and Short Positions Change; Yarn Market Advances and Retreats Sharply; Highest Price Reaches 1544 Yuan

The yarn market, which had been declining for two consecutive days, presented a scene of sharp advance and retreat yesterday. This was due to the securities help in the air. At the same time, the Cantonese help made a large deal of more than 700 bags of 32-count Golden Rooster, 20-count Shepherd, and 10-count Red Double Horse yarn. As a result, people were encouraged, the market tightened, and the buying momentum was especially strong. 20-count Double Horse once rose to 1,544 yuan. The high price caused those who made a profit to sell out, falling back 20 yuan. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,544 yuan, and the low price was 1,525 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the weekend, the transaction volume was scarce. At present, major players in the yarn market have mostly sold out their Double Horse factory orders, but outsiders have come to drag in, and the positions of the long and short sides have been reversed. The low price on May 27 was 1,372 yuan, and yesterday's peak has reached 1,544 yuan, an increase of 172 yuan. Today, 2,825 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened in the morning with a tighter momentum, because the shorts were all filling in. The first board price was 1,525 yuan, with slight advances and retreats at 26-27 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1,533-1,534 yuan. A part of the profit-takers sold out, falling back to 1,525 yuan. In an instant, it was said that gold had risen and Cantonese sales had not declined, and the buying momentum suddenly increased, rising again to 1,144 yuan. Unexpectedly, after 12:00, the margin suddenly fell, and people's minds relaxed. It suddenly fell to 1,525 yuan. The closing price was 1,526 yuan. The statistics for the transaction volume in half a day were 10,720 bags, including 720 bags from the Hong Kong gang and 10,000 bags of peer-to-peer ball business.

The market situation of Golden Double Horse standard yarn continued to advance due to short covering and bulls adding to their positions, so the market was tighter. The July period rose by 15 yuan, and the August period rose by 1.5 yuan, but after the close, the July period was weaker. It was found that the business of the exchange had been seen twice, so the transaction volume in half a day was very strong, with more than 10,000 bags. The high and low prices for half a day are recorded on the left.

### Fine Velvet's Asking Price is Too High, Hindering Factory Sales

The cotton situation is continuing to rise, with coarse velvet being the main transaction. Fine velvet, such as Meter Lin and Brazil Four Cotton, has become a scarce and expensive item, so the holders are hoarding goods severely, and the asking price is too high, which hinders consumption. It is difficult for factories to start, so the transaction volume is not as exciting as it used to be. However, the public is more willing to purchase raw materials for coarse velvet, and the price is relatively flat, so purchasing has been lively in recent days. The weekend transaction volume was 1,420 pieces and 180 bags, and the price rose by two or three yuan.

Rangoon Flower 230 Rongfeng 200 pieces sent to the factory

Huomu Jia 202 Hefeng 160 pieces sent to the factory

Meter Lin 475 Haojia 100 pieces delivered to the warehouse

Brazil Flower 436 Haojia 110 pieces delivered to the warehouse

Bailuo Qu 160 Haojia 100 pieces delivered to the warehouse

Yamla 223 Haojia 100 pieces delivered to the warehouse

Yamla 225 Haojia 250 pieces delivered to the warehouse

Rangoon Flower 212 Haojia 300 pieces delivered to the warehouse

Rangoon Flower 212 Haojia 300 pieces delivered to the warehouse

Huoji Flower 194 Haojia 180 bags delivered to the warehouse

Another report on foreign cotton trading in Shanghai port: because the current yarn is soaring, and the foreign cotton market is rising again and again, and ordering is quite troublesome, the cotton market is still tight. Yesterday, in addition to Haojia's large transaction of Brazilian cotton, the factory's purchase intention was also strong, and there were also two or three batches of Argentine and Indian cotton transactions.

The New York cotton market, due to enthusiastic purchases by New Orleans and short covering, was lively and firm. Yesterday's purchase price rose by 5 to 11 pounds sound compared to the previous day.

Another telegram: The US cotton statistics from August 1 last year to June 20 this year are recorded on the left (500 pounds per bag):

Cumulative listing: 2,616,000 bags

Cumulative factory use: 9,164,000 bags

Cumulative exports: 1,013,000 bags

To Japan: 31,000 bags

To China: 79,000 bags

To the United Kingdom: 37,000 bags

To Germany: 129,000 bags

To various port cities: 5,739,000 bags

The Indian cotton market rose first due to speculative purchases by traders and peers, and then fell slightly due to some profit-taking. As a result, the closing price rose by 2 to 8 rupees compared to the previous day. It is also predicted that the market will open high by one rupee today.

### Piece Goods: Eastern Piece Goods Speculation is Frenzied; Short Covering and Hoarding Fly Together

The factory cloth market yesterday rose sharply due to the eastern piece goods short covering, and people's minds were leaning upwards. Peers and hoarders searched for scattered cheap goods. Holders were watching with interest, and the factory prices also increased. Therefore, the selling prices of all cloths trended upwards uniformly. White goods, coarse and fine cloth twills each rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece, and bleached and dyed cloth increased by 5 jiao. The transaction volume was not strong. This street handled more than 200 pieces of grey cloth and bleached and dyed cloth, and the Yantai and Qingdao gangs on the north road handled more than 100 pieces of heavy and light coarse cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong khaki blue cloth handled more than 200 pieces, and the Nanyang gang handled more than 100 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth coarse cloth from Yihua, Lun Chang and other factories. Today, 1,314 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong.

The rising trend of Eastern cloth continued to flourish, because the yarn price was high, and the real steel market expanded. Furthermore, the market was full of idle funds, and outside hoarders regarded cloth as cheap, and searched for large amounts of goods for several days. Each stall felt a shortage of spot goods, so white goods and fine cloth rose again by 7.5 to 9 jiao per piece, and fine twill rose by 5 to 7.5 jiao. The noon closing price of Longtou fine cloth factory's warehouse order was 47.15 yuan, and Longtou fine twill also raised the entire 43.75 yuan. The monthly futures cloth in the trading hall also continued to rise by 7-8 jiao. General shorts were busy covering, and they were not as powerful as before. Sèhuo Four Gentlemen Biji opened at 1.58 yuan in the morning, and once rose to 1.5925 yuan. In the middle, retailers sold for profit, returning to 1.57875 yuan. Finally, due to the depletion of warehouse order chips and outside purchases and hoarding, the closing price started at 1.59 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Relax Again

Yesterday, the sugar market trend turned soft and relaxed slightly. The association divided the spot price of two-four coarse white foreign warehouse for June imports at 91 yuan, down 7 jiao, April imports at 88.6 yuan, March imports at 88.4 yuan, small triangular, January imports at 87.8 yuan, down 7 jiao. Taikoo's car white also relaxed with it, B mark at 105.6 jiao, small four jiao, HM mark at 75 yuan, down 5 jiao, and there was a lack of transactions for the rest.

### Cotton (5)

— Gao Jiannong

The earliest European use of cotton clothing can only be traced back to the twelfth century: that was the result of the Crusades, and this type of clothing was very highly valued. Later, as transportation became more frequent, the import of cotton fabrics to Western Europe naturally increased. And it seems that in the middle of the thirteenth century, Venetian workers were already able to imitate Eastern techniques and weave cotton cloth themselves: however, the cotton thread used was probably not spun by themselves but purchased from the East. France's initial use of cotton to manufacture goods can only be traced back to the sixteenth century: the establishment of woolen shops was in Rouen in 1534 and in Lyon in 1580. The cotton industries of England and the Netherlands also began at this time.

The strangest thing is that when the Spanish conquered the New World in the sixteenth century, they saw Indians planting cotton very carefully and weaving cloth very skillfully everywhere from Mexico to Brazil, from the West Indies to Peru. These shallow conquerors, who may have only heard the name of cotton cloth before, were now dazzled by the value and ingenuity of this thing, and forced the Indians to act as permanent tribute products. One type of cotton, with long silky filaments, is now the most widely cultivated in various countries, which we call "American cotton"; some believe that its origin is Mexico, while others believe that this is just another branch of herbaceous cotton from the Old World; also, there are some varieties of cotton on the islands of Australia, which are scattered like weeds everywhere, how should this be explained? It is clear that we have again touched the thorny issue of the origin of plants and the origin of humans, which is chaotic and incomprehensible!

As for the United States, which now produces the most cotton in the world, the Spanish first tried planting cotton in its southeastern state of Florida in 1664; and it was not until 1784 that the first fourteen bales (264 catties per bale) of cotton were shipped to England; after five years, it had already become 130,000 bales; and by 1820, it had already increased to 600,000 bales... What about now...?

### Endorsement for Chairman Chiang is Growing, U.S. Aid to China Shows Increased Proactivity. Both Spiritual and Material Support Will Surely Have a Greater Impact in the Future. U.S. Planes in Chongqing Have Already Engaged in Combat with Japanese Aircraft.

A mainland newspaper's editorial yesterday, titled "America Pays Tribute to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and His Wife," included the following translated excerpt: "This past Thursday, fifteen hundred American and Chinese officials, as well as leaders from the financial, cultural, and commercial sectors, held a grand banquet in New York City, New York, unanimously paying tribute to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife. The committee, chaired by Wendell Willkie, was warmly welcomed by all guests. Speakers included the Luce family. Mrs. Luce stated that, aside from President and Mrs. Roosevelt, Chairman and Madame Chiang Kai-shek are truly the greatest figures in the world. This kind of praise is most significant."

American People's Sincere Affection

This kind of sincere affection undoubtedly demonstrates that, besides President and Mrs. Roosevelt, Chairman and Madame Chiang Kai-shek are indeed the most admired figures by the American people. This is particularly fortunate for China, as the leader of their nation has earned the affection of the American people, and the spiritual and material assistance from the United States to China will surely have a greater impact.

Noble Character and Steadfast Composure

Considering the reasons why Chairman Chiang is so admired, there are several points that stand out. First, the top leader of China is seen by the American people as the symbol of the entire 450 million Chinese people resisting Japanese aggression. Second, Chairman and Madame Chiang Kai-shek have fully demonstrated the spirit of Christianity in their endeavors, as religion has a great influence among millions of people in the United States. Therefore, the greatest reason for admiring Chairman and Madame Chiang Kai-shek is their noble character. Chairman Chiang is able to deter the Japanese army's advance with steadfast composure and expose Japan's conspiracies against China, while Madame Chiang is able to assist him in the same manner. This spirit allows the American government and people to warmly sympathize with and understand Chairman and Madame Chiang Kai-shek and the entire Chinese people they lead, which is truly of great significance.

Japanese Acknowledge U.S. Planes in China

The *North-China Daily News* reports that Japanese Army spokesman Colonel Akiyama, at a press conference yesterday (the 10th), mentioned reports of American pilots and aviation experts going to Chongqing to assist in operations against Japan, stating that the nationality of those fighting against Japan is not important, and they will be treated the same as Chinese officers. Japanese aircraft have already encountered American-made planes, but these planes are being flown by Chinese pilots. If they were piloted by American pilots, the Japanese would also welcome it, he said. In addition, a Japanese Navy spokesman stated that the Chinese army continues to lay floating mines in the Yangtze River, and four or five were discovered last week.

### U.S. Aid Groups Raise Funds: $5 Million USD. Dedicated to Purchasing Aid for China This Year. United China Relief Allocates 1.6 Million.

The United China Relief's American Bureau for Medical Aid to China has been established since September 1937, expending all efforts over four years to raise funds and purchase medical supplies to aid China, actively carrying out these activities.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Employees to Receive Another Universal Allowance Increase. The Council Officially Announced the Increase Method Yesterday and Stipulated Implementation Starting from May.

The Impact on Prices is Significant, Causing Widespread Public Anxiety.

The matter of the Shanghai Municipal Council employees universally receiving another salary increase, which has been under public scrutiny, was proposed by the Civil Service Commission. After a meeting last Thursday where a decision was postponed, almost two weeks have passed. People from all walks of life have been making urgent appeals, urging the authorities to consider the people's livelihoods and avoid stimulating price increases due to the further increase in salaries for Municipal Council employees, and to give the most careful consideration to the original proposal made by the Civil Service Commission. Although it was widely rumored that the proposal had been passed at the routine meeting convened by the Civil Service Commission on Monday evening, many people remained skeptical. They hoped that a final decision would be made at the regular meeting next Thursday. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Municipal Council officially released information yesterday, announcing the "Temporary Measures for Additional Living Cost Allowances for Employees," and stipulated that they would be implemented starting in May, without waiting for the formal passage at next week's regular meeting. This was quite unexpected. The measures are recorded below:

Council Officially Announces Increased Cost of Living

According to information released by the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office, "Regarding the case of temporary living allowance for employees of this bureau, it has been carefully considered by the Civil Service Commission and the Board of Directors of this bureau. Since November of last year (i.e., the time of the last allowance increase), the cost of living in this port has increased by more than 40%. Therefore, this bureau has decided to issue temporary living allowance to employees from May 1st as follows:

Calculated by Grade Based on Original Salary

(1) For Chinese employees without employment contracts, an allowance of 185% will be issued for the first 200 yuan of their monthly salary, and an allowance of 150% will be issued for the portion beyond 200 yuan. The minimum allowance is set at 45 yuan per month. (2) For all employees with employment contracts, an allowance of 185% will be issued for the first 500 yuan of their monthly salary, an allowance of 150% will be issued for the second 500 yuan of their monthly salary, and an allowance of 120% will be issued for the portion exceeding 1,000 yuan. For "A" grade employees whose salary is one-third subject to exchange rate allowance, this allowance will be issued for two-thirds of their salary according to the above method.

Lower-Salaried Employees More Advantageous

As a result of this additional allowance, the compensation obtained by general "B" and "C" grade employees with lower salaries due to the aforementioned high cost of living is approximately 13%. At the same time, the compensation obtained by employees with larger salaries is relatively smaller.

Stipulated to Take Effect from May

The aforementioned measures are temporary measures to show consideration for employees. As for more permanent measures for adjusting employee salaries on a regular basis, they are pending consideration and adoption by this bureau. Any measures, once approved, will take effect from May 1st."

Far-Reaching Implications

Well-informed sources pointed out yesterday that the repeated universal salary increase for Municipal Council employees may have two impacts: (1) The salaries of Municipal Council employees are usually the standard for salaries of employees in other industries. After Municipal Council employees received a universal living allowance last November, salaries in various industries also tended to rise accordingly. This decision to increase salaries again will inevitably cause salaries in various industries to fluctuate. Although the increase in Municipal Council employees' salaries is said to be due to a 40% increase in prices, many believe that there is no reason to be the same as the previous salary increase. Therefore, this repeated salary increase will cause salaries in other industries to increase as well, further raising prices and causing people throughout the city to experience the difficulty of making a living. This is one. (2) If the economic situation of the Municipal Council is difficult to sustain the repeated increase in employee salaries, then it can only be compensated by increasing taxes or borrowing. If taxes are increased, the new land regulations supplementary rule 52, paragraph 3, "If the decision of the Municipal Council or the Board of Appeal becomes the final decision and has legal effect, the Municipal Council may implement this decision and collect taxes in accordance with Articles 10 and 20 of the Land Regulations." The Shanghai Municipal Council's authority to levy taxes has been expanded. In order to cope with extraordinary needs, the Municipal Council may levy taxes based on the expanded authority, and the consequences are self-evident.

Public Bus Fares Increase Again

Also, regarding the British-owned public bus company's plan to increase fares by another 51% starting July 1, it is widely believed that it has been fully approved after the meeting of the Public Utilities Committee this Thursday. However, the Council postponed the decision at the meeting last Thursday, but it has now been re-approved by the Public Utilities Committee, so it is bound to be approved and implemented by the Council. This is especially evident after the Municipal Council announced another increase in living allowances yesterday. The announcement date does not have to wait until after the meeting of the Board of Directors next Thursday, and may be seen in fact within two or three days. However, the general public has always opposed the increase in public utility fees, as it directly affects the livelihoods of everyone. The Shanghai Municipal Council has no reason to approve the repeated increase in fares for public buses or trolleys, as it only gives the company an opportunity to earn more profits.

### Lei Xiong Acting as Regiment Commander of the Isolated Army

Xie Jinyuan, the regiment commander of the Isolated Army on Singapore Road, was fatally stabbed by disloyal soldiers Hao Jingcheng and others in a mutiny on the morning of April 24th while personally leading soldiers in morning exercises.

### Changes in Airmail Postage Rates

Postal Bureau Notice: Regarding the airmail postage rates for newspapers, printed matter, documents for the blind, trade contracts, samples, business brochures, and small packages exchanged domestically, which will be uniformly changed to 2.5 jiao in national currency per ten grams starting June 20th of this year, the Bureau has already notified everyone in Notice No. 1671 on the 17th of this month. Now, it is found that these newly established airmail rates refer to the aforementioned items of mail to and from the bureaus in the southwest and northwest regions. Those exchanged within the occupied areas and transported by Japanese aircraft will still be charged airmail postage rates as usual (see Notice No. 1661 of this Bureau on April 15th of this year), and there will be no changes. This notice is urgently issued to inform everyone. This notice.

### Fundamental Solution to Eliminate Black Market Exchange Rates: Unified Circulation of Chips. No Discrimination Between Cash, Checking, and Transfer Payments. The Public Draft System is Being Researched for Reform.

The Silver and Money Trades Association has recently received suggestions from banking employees that the chips circulating in Shanghai are divided into "cash," "checking," and "transfer," but in fact, they are all national currency. This has resulted in abnormal situations of black market exchange rates, and speculators take the opportunity to profit from it. This has hindered social finance. The suggestion is that there should be no difference between these

Three Types of Chips

and that it will be submitted to a joint meeting of the two trade associations to study how to unify the circulation of chips, with the aim of facilitating all industries, eliminating speculation, and stabilizing finance. Once a specific plan has been discussed, it will be publicly announced and implemented. Regarding the black market exchange rate for transfers, the Ministry of Finance has long ordered its abolition. The black market exchange rate for checking has been addressed by the Banking Joint Reserve Association. Both black market exchange rates are prohibited by law. Bank deposit slips that specify cash, checking, or transfer should also be abolished to avoid affecting people's minds. In addition, the Money Trades Association is researching the

Public Draft Issue

And has proposed four opinions, forming a Public Draft Issue Research Committee, with two representatives from the Money Trades Reserve and seven representatives from various firms as members. It is hoped that various firms will submit as many opinions as possible for discussion. The four opinions are recorded below: (1) It is proposed to continue using the public draft reporting form for clearing, which should be submitted by each firm to the money reserve after the figures have been verified. (2) Specify the time for receiving drafts, restore the public draft system and improve it. (3) Adopt the clearing method of the clearing house. (4) Extend the clearing time by half an hour, mutually check the figures, and each firm opens a public draft. It is heard that the Silver and Money Trades Association has

Decided on Closing Holiday

And has recently announced: (1) Banks will have a holiday on July 1st and 2nd for the semi-annual settlement as usual. (2) Money trades will have a two-day holiday on July 1st and 2nd for the semi-annual settlement. (3) Various industries in the market, such as foreign exchange, gold, cotton yarn, beans, rice, grains, securities, hardware, cotton cloth, and coal, have decided to close the market for two days on July 1st and 2nd to handle the semi-annual settlement, and will resume business simultaneously with the silver and money trades on the 3rd. It is also heard that the Silver and Money Trades Reserve, the Money Trades Market Clearing House, and the Draft Acceptance Center will be closed on July 1st and 2nd.

### Da Cheng Steamer Detained

The British-owned Da Cheng steamer, which was test-sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou, has reportedly been detained by Japanese warships anchored in the Zhejiang Sea while en route. The location of the detention is said to be either in the waters off Putuo Mountain or off Zhoushan. The actual situation has not yet been reported. It is understood that since this was a test sailing, no cargo was loaded, but there were many passengers. The company is working to transport the passengers back to Shanghai.

### After Report That U.S. Ships Have Been Requisitioned, Two Ships to Be Dispatched First to Take Over the Route. Limited Tonnage May Not Fully Accommodate Passengers. Shipping Industry Suggests Expanding Cabin Space.

Seven mail ships owned by the U.S. President Lines, including the President Coolidge, which sail on the Pacific route and the world itinerary, have been requisitioned by the U.S. government to undertake transportation duties and are about to return to the United States to gather

And await orders.

According to sources from the local U.S. mail ship company yesterday, after the President Coolidge and other 535.S. (class) ships are requisitioned and suspended, the C.3 class (i.e., the recently round-the-world itinerary ships) and the 502, 'S. President, Fillmore two sister ships will take over the route first, and the schedule will be decided soon. However, since the two sister ships are too old, they may not fully accommodate passengers. It is also said that these ships

Only Have First Class

cabins. Although the fares are slightly lower than the 535.'S (class) ships, since this year's Chinese students studying in the United States (estimated at more than one hundred and fifty people) urgently need to go to the United States, they will be the first to continue the route. However, they feel that the fares of these two ships are too expensive. The company has now received suggestions from the shipping industry, so when these two ships regularly sail to the Far East, they may add second and third class cabins to meet the needs of general passengers. As for other replacement ships to continue the route, they are currently being considered.

Smooth Sailing

Beside the pond in the French Garden, there are often many children holding model sailboats, putting them on the water, and letting them float slowly with a gentle breeze. There are no raging waves here, making it a veritable "Little Pacific." (Photo by Kang Zuyi)

### Wishing You a Limitless Future

Dear elementary school graduates!

You must be busy with your graduation exams these days! In this great era, most children across the country are out of school. You are so fortunate to be able to complete your studies and graduate from elementary school! It's a truly fortunate event, worthy of celebration!

But, are you content with just graduating from elementary school? No, certainly not! Graduation merely signifies the completion of one stage. After elementary school, there's middle school, and after middle school, there's university. The path ahead is limitless! As the saying goes: "Learning knows no bounds, learning has no end." "You can learn until you're old, and still not learn everything." How can you be complacent after graduating from elementary school and stop progressing?

Therefore, for those of you planning to continue your education, selecting a school should be done with great care. "A miss of an inch leads to a loss of a mile." You'll suffer immense losses if you're not careful. As for those entering school, it goes without saying that you should strive to learn and strengthen your bodies. China is in the midst of hardship, and it awaits each of you to take on the great responsibility of building the nation in the future.

Even for those of you who are not continuing your education, don't cut off your path to knowledge. Acquiring knowledge and skills doesn't solely rely on education from schools. As long as you are willing to work hard and strive for improvement, you can still succeed. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, many successful people have come from struggling and striving. I hope you too will temper yourselves in hardship, enrich yourselves, and be able to stand on your own in society and serve your country in the future.

Children, work hard! Move forward! Wishing you a limitless future!

### Children's Lives in Wartime Countries

— Yingdai

When a country is at war, the lives of its people are inevitably affected. Children, being a part of the population, will naturally experience a different life than in peacetime. Here's a look at the lives of children in various countries during wartime:

Germany: Germany has always placed great emphasis on the training of children, especially after the outbreak of war. All children in Germany, from the age of eight to under fourteen, are forced to undergo preliminary military training. Those over the age of fourteen join the Hitler Youth and receive advanced military training. Once they reach adulthood, they can enlist in the army.

Italy: Under Mussolini's rule, Italy has the "Wolf Cub" organization, divided into junior and senior levels, engaged in military training. Since the outbreak of war, this training has been intensified. Furthermore, members of the Wolf Cub, around the age of fifteen, have joined the wartime service corps, taking on tasks such as air raid defense and first aid, with considerable success.

England: After the war broke out in England, children in major cities were evacuated to the countryside, causing significant changes in their lives. Although they can still attend school in the countryside, the material comforts are far less than in the cities. However, even now, you can still see children playing in the parks of London, indicating that not all children have been evacuated.

Other: Although the United States has not yet joined the war, the children in the United States have developed a considerable interest in war due to the intense atmosphere of domestic competition. What they talk about and study are all related to military affairs and war. As for the Soviet Union, like the United States, it has not yet joined the war. However, Soviet children, who have always enjoyed studying crafts, are now paying even more attention to this aspect, hoping to make inventions that will enhance national defense in the future. It shows that Soviet children are not only able to endure hardship but also have great ambitions.

### Chatting About the North Pole

— Zhang Jiaju

Dear children! We once learned in geography class that the North Pole is a place of snow and ice. There, everything on the ground is covered by dazzling ice blocks, forming a boundless ice sheet. The harsh climate and scarcity of resources make even the Eskimos, who are famous for living in cold climates near the Arctic, reluctant to live there.

Therefore, until recently, the North Pole, where one year is like one day, half the year is day, and half is night, was a mystery to people. We imagined that in such a harsh place, how could there be any living beings? However, after continuous exploration and failures, scientific progress has finally allowed humans to conquer the North Pole and reveal its secrets.

In July 1937, Soviet scientists landed on the ice floes of the North Pole by plane. They brought many complete instruments and ample food to conduct scientific research. They stayed there for several months, drifting for many miles during this period, experiencing months of darkness and long days. As a result, they brought us a lot of new knowledge. The following are their findings:

Many living beings exist in the North Pole. Polar bears and seals live in groups on the ice sheet, and seagulls and other birds fly in the sky. There are many small creatures in the water under three or four meters of ice. All this is contrary to our imagination.

Previous books often said that there are five oceans and five continents on Earth. This statement was originally correct, but now the facts prove that although the Arctic is an ocean, the Antarctic is a continent. This is also one of the gains of Arctic exploration.

The Arctic Ocean can also be used. Now the Soviet Union is actively carrying out long-term navigation between its Far Eastern border and its European part. Weather stations can be built on the ice floes to provide weather information to airplanes and ships, ensuring their safety.

The development of the Arctic and Antarctic is just beginning. In the future, we will definitely be able to get more new knowledge about this from the newspapers.

### Children and Hobbies

— Xinfang

I believe every child understands the meaning of the word "hobby." However, there is a distinction between good and bad hobbies, and I'm afraid many children are unclear about this distinction. Everyone should have a hobby. After a day of work, a person can use their hobby to regulate their spirit. If a student focuses solely on studying and doesn't know any proper ways to relax, the result will definitely be tragic. The greatest significance of a hobby is to help our lives enter the realm of success.

Now let's look at the hobbies of general children. In the neighborhood where I live, there is a child around ten years old. Recently, he managed to save about ten yuan, which is not easy. But he used this money to buy a pair of ice skates, because he has a hobby of skating. There is also a son of one of my friends. His parents give him four yuan a month for pocket money. This child doesn't eat snacks or read books, but because he admires the heroes in foreign movies, he often asks his parents for money before the end of the month.

The two examples above are not too bad. If it is a bad hobby, it will not only not be of any benefit to us, but also cause losses in terms of money, time, and spirit. Dear children! Money, time, and spirit are your three most precious things. So, from today onwards, you should pay attention to your own hobbies, and especially not indulge in bad hobbies, because this will hinder your future!

### How to Make Your Own Envelopes

— Meng

Dear children, don't you often write letters to your classmates and friends? Students who live in dormitories also have to write letters to their parents. But in this era of expensive rice and firewood, the prices of all kinds of goods are soaring, and even envelopes made of rough paper cost five or six jiao per bundle. Since they are so expensive, we might as well make a few ourselves to save a few jiao. How do we do it?

First, tear off the cover of a used foreign notebook, and use the blank side as the front. As for the inside, even if it has writing, it doesn't matter. Then, imitate the shape of an envelope and cut it out with scissors. After cutting it out, paste it with glue, and you have a money-saving and elegant envelope! Wouldn't it be great to send it out?

Children, why not give it a try?

### Common Things in Hot Weather (Part Two)

— Lin Ren

Last Sunday, A-Liang's father was in the middle of an engaging story when his mother interrupted their conversation. So, this Sunday, A-Liang specifically asked his father to continue the story and didn't go out to play. Even when the children from the neighborhood came to ask him to play, he declined, saying he was busy. Seeing that A-Liang was listening so attentively, his father was motivated to continue.

"Okay, I'll tell you about something else! In the summer, there are many brief showers. One moment it's sunny, the next it's raining. Therefore, there is especially a lot of rain. So, why are there so many brief showers in the summer? You need to know that summer in Shanghai is already very hot, but the inland areas are even hotter than Shanghai. This is because Shanghai has the advantage of being on the coast. So, in the summer, differences in air temperature between different regions are common. When the difference is too great, the air will move rapidly, which is what we call a brief gust of wind. This wind brings the rain clouds over, thus causing a brief shower. However, brief showers don't last long, because the air is constantly moving, and soon the clouds are blown away. The rain naturally stops, and the sun shines through. So, there is a saying: 'A brief shower scares the little devils,' which describes how short brief showers are. Right after the rain, the sun comes out, forming a colorful rainbow in the sky. I remember Grandma telling us: 'You can't point at a rainbow, or your finger will rot.' You need to know that a rainbow is sunlight shining on the fine raindrops in the air. The light is refracted by the raindrops and divided into seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, which are arranged in the sky, creating a rainbow. The saying that if you point at it, your finger will rot, is really the most unreasonable superstition. If your classmates still believe this saying, you can try showing them what happens when there is a rainbow. Will your finger rot? I guarantee that you won't rot your finger. This will break their superstitious beliefs, and you will have done something quite meaningful. In the summer, there is also a lot of thunder. Suddenly, dark clouds gather, lightning flashes, and thunder roars. Then, a gust of wind blows, and a torrential rain pours down. So, there is a saying: 'Thunder urges thunder, thunder urges wind, wind urges rain,' which is very accurate. I remember Grandma always talked about dragons taking water during thunderstorms. Are there really dragons in the sky? Do dragons really take water? In fact, the so-called dragons taking water is not dragons taking water, but the wind is taking the place of the dragons taking water. Have you ever seen a whirlwind? This is common on land. When a small whirlwind starts, the scraps of paper and dust on the ground are swirled up by the whirlwind. If the whirlwind is large, it will often lift the scraps of paper, etc., up into the air. And dragons taking water is the large whirlwind that appears in rivers and seas, swirling the water in the rivers and seas upwards, just like the small whirlwind on land swirling up scraps of paper and dust. However, the force of the whirlwind in the rivers and seas is exceptionally strong. Sometimes, in the water column swirled up by the whirlwind, you can see golden dragon scales. Some people then determine that this is evidence of dragons taking water. In fact, these golden dragon scales are the sunlight reflected on the water column. So, the matter of dragons taking water is also a misunderstanding by people. And dragons may have existed in ancient times, but dragons can be said to have disappeared by now." A-Liang listened with unblinking eyes, as if he were mesmerized.

### Several Strange Fish

— Ji

Archerfish: Archerfish are a type of strange fish found in the fresh water of the South Seas. They resemble our common mandarin fish in shape, with a large mouth and a short body. They can shoot water bullets from their mouths to knock down insects on the surface of the water for food, shooting as if anti-aircraft guns are shooting down airplanes.

Climbing Perch: Climbing perch live in the fresh water of Malaysia. Their bodies are flat and about seven inches long. They can climb onto land. When climbing, they use the spines of their anal and ventral fins to push themselves forward, as if using their feet. After climbing onto land, they do not use gills to breathe. The head has a special structure to replace the gills for breathing, and they can climb trees to eat dew and insects on the leaves of the trees.

Electric Ray: The electric ray is one of more than fifty species of electric fish. It is very fierce in the sea and can generate electricity from its ingenious prism-shaped organs. When hunting fish, it emits electricity from its body. Fish that touch the electricity immediately become unconscious and are swallowed in one bite. Furthermore, its electricity can produce real sparks.

Short News: The first collection of fairy tales by the famous writer Huang Yingdai, "The Autobiography of a Manuscript," has been published by Huasheng Bookstore at a price of thirty cents. Written from the perspective of a manuscript, it describes the situation of post offices and newspapers, and provides many guidelines for writing and submitting articles. The book contains 10,000 words and is vividly written. All readers of this magazine can attach postage stamps or legal tender of thirty cents and send them to Mr. Huang at 149 Gubalu Road. The author will send back a personally signed copy. The second collection, "The Autobiography of Mickey Mouse," is also being written and will be published soon.

### The Root Cause of Yan Hua and Zhou Xuan's Marital Crisis

— A'mei

Movie star Zhou Xuan and her husband Yan Hua have been arguing fiercely for the past few days, and the situation has reached a rather serious stage. This magazine has reported on it twice, and the two parties' advertisements have also appeared in this newspaper yesterday and the day before yesterday, with one refuting and one replying, making quite a noisy commotion. From the advertisements, it can be seen that both parties only mentioned the process and did not reach the point of breaking up. Judging from this, there are still some twists and turns before they can be said to be reconciled. The writer has obtained the cause of this matter from another source. If it is true, then they will not reach the step of divorce. I am now writing this at the end. If it is true, I hope that they will abandon their prejudices and restore their relationship to its original state.

The course of an event often has many twists and turns. In the process of twists and turns, being able to recognize the reasoning will always achieve its purpose. The current situation of Yan and Zhou is tense due to this twisted process. They have now made things difficult. According to the news obtained by the writer, I dare not recklessly judge Yan Hua's attitude towards Zhou Xuan on weekdays, but when Zhou Xuan resolutely decided to ask lawyer Li Weibin to file a divorce request, crystalline tears involuntarily fell from her haggard face, and there must have been considerable pain in her heart. However, after living together for nine years, divorce in one day, not to mention the external

### Why Divorce?

— Yuan Xuefen

Dragon and phoenix candles illuminate the newlyweds,
Music plays as they tie the knot,
Talented man and beautiful woman, everyone praises,
Husband and wife live in harmony.
Being able to marry in this life,
Is due to a predestined fate from a previous life,
If the marriage is destined, it will come true even if it is far away,
If it is not destined, it will not meet even if it is near.
Just think, there are hundreds of millions of men and women in the world,
Why did the two of us get married?
In the dead of night when everyone is quiet,
Everyone touches their own heart.
Have I treated him unfairly?
Compare your heart to his heart.
Always think one step back,
Contentment brings true happiness.
If the other person has shortcomings,
Advise them softly,
Once, twice, even three times,
The other person will definitely not be heartless.
A hundred nights of love for a night of marriage,
The love between husband and wife is as deep as the sea.
Moreover, you have been married for several years,
There is always love between husband and wife.
It must be because of trivial matters,
That storms arise in the family.
Fighting and scolding,
Then hiring a lawyer to handle the divorce.
Knowing that you would divorce today, why did you get married in the first place?
Divorcing him today,
And marrying another tomorrow,
Getting married and divorced is unclear,
Lawyers are just doing business.
Life is originally a play,
With its own joys and sorrows, separations and reunions.
Seeing a comedy, people laugh,
Seeing a tragedy, tears fall.
Everyone hopes for a happy ending,
A broken mirror reunited is truly joyful.
Let's not keep the past in mind,
From now on, husband and wife should make up and live again.
The past is like yesterday,
The future begins today,
Be good husband and wife,
And live happily ever after.
Husband and wife live in harmony,
And grow old together without separation.
(But) how is reputation damaged, putting aside considerations of the object of human emotion, is not Zhou Xuan's wish. However, why did she entrust a lawyer to send a letter mentioning the words "divorce"? It is said that the initial motive and hope were nothing more than to prompt Yan Hua to improve his treatment. Moreover, once the incident occurred, relatives and friends would surely come to persuade, and then it could be resolved peacefully. Unexpectedly, it became serious after Zhou Xuan left in anger, and he used advertisements to warn her. In this way, everyone knew about it, the situation expanded, and face was at stake, so it was difficult to clean up. Therefore, in the first conversation between the two parties at Liu Zhonghao's home, the focus was on questioning Yan Hua why he published in the newspaper. Yan Xiao understood her intention and did not euphemistically explain it and properly seek a remedy, resulting in a stalemate. If Yan Hua had not publicly published in the newspaper at the beginning, but after receiving the lawyer's letter, he had asked relatives and friends to persuade her with kind words, giving her a guarantee not to take surveillance attitudes or scold and beat her randomly, perhaps Zhou Xuan could have understood and there would have been no unexpected outcome. Moreover, they have loved each other for nine years, and Zhou has no other lover. Even the law would be difficult to constitute the reason for Article 1052 of the Civil Code. Although the situation is about to reach the extreme, in fact Yan Hua does not want a divorce, and how can Zhou Xuan have the intention to divorce? It is hoped that Yan Jun will refer to the above opinions and deal with them sincerely, and a satisfactory result will be obtained. The reporter has a slight intention for the sake of protecting both parties. I wonder what both parties think?

### Blood Rain, Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter Eleven: Heroic Demeanor Comes to Fierce Battle

Because Xu Jing was guarding a village at the Pubo Estuary, a scout at the Ye Niu River spotted bandits secretly building a pontoon bridge across the river for a sneak crossing. He hurriedly reported to Xu Jing. Xu Jing dared not delay and quickly led two hundred cavalrymen to the riverbank. In the darkness, they shot arrows towards the pontoon bridge being built in the river. Many bandits were shot and fell into the water. However, many small boats had already approached the riverbank, and the bandits braved the rain of arrows, bravely charging ashore. Xu Jing led his troops to meet them, but unfortunately, his subordinates were too few, and the bandits kept crossing the river in an endless stream. Xu Jing sent someone to Wang Yongtai to beg for reinforcements while fighting the bandits with all his might. After a long melee, most of the two hundred cavalrymen were killed or wounded, and the bandits in the river surged up like a tide. Fearing that they would be surrounded and unable to escape, he quickly broke through the encirclement and rushed to Wang Yongtai to report the alarm, wanting to discuss how to resist. But who knew that Li Zicheng's main force of bandits had already secretly crossed the river to the west of Wang Yongtai, and were ambushing them? Torches shone brightly, like several fire dragons leaping in the wilderness, with shouts like thunder, their momentum extremely arrogant. Wang Yongtai did not have time to say anything more to Xu Jing. Everyone raised their weapons and directed the government troops to kill towards the fire. The lieutenant of this bandit force was Luo, known as "One-Eyed Tiger," a favorite and brave general of Li Zicheng. He was exceptionally brave, always charging ahead in every battle, riding a lowly horse, wielding a broadsword, and naked from the waist up, rushing towards the front of the government army's camp. His soldiers were also seasoned veterans, the elite of Li Zicheng's forces. Wang Yongtai met him head-on. One-Eyed Tiger's broadsword slashed fiercely at his horse's head, with the force of a whirlwind and torrential rain. Wang Yongtai's serpent spear was barely able to suppress him, and the two fought fiercely for fifty or sixty rounds. Wang Yongtai saw that One-Eyed Tiger was indeed brave and could not be underestimated. One-Eyed Tiger also felt that this old general's skill was extraordinary and fought with all his strength. Xu Jing, fearing that Wang Yongtai would be at a disadvantage, charged forward on his horse with his spear to assist in the battle. The bandits had already surrounded their team in a large circle. At the same time, the bandits by the river seized the opportunity to cross the river and joined forces with the team of bandits at Chenjiadu, attacking the government troops from all sides. With seven or eight thousand men from three directions, how could Wang Yongtai's isolated army withstand them? The casualties among his subordinates gradually increased, and the camps were all broken through by the bandits, who set fires, burning everything red.
