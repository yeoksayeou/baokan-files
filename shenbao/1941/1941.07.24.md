### The South Pacific Crisis Intensifies: England and the United States Establish an Agreement; Determine Response Steps for Future Vietnamese Situation; Dekoux and Japanese Representatives Hold Second Meeting

Reuter's, Chongqing, 23rd: Reliable foreign sources here suggest that large-scale Japanese actions in the Pacific are imminent. It is reported that Japan's mobilization is now in full swing, and the third-level reserves have been called up. The requisition of cars and livestock is currently underway. Another source predicts that Japan will take action against southern Vietnam on July 25th.

Associated Press, London, 23rd: It was learned yesterday that, after detailed discussions, England and the United States have established a full agreement on the steps to be taken if Japan occupies French Indochina. The contents of this measure have not yet been disclosed. The three governments with a direct interest in the Far East have all received reports stating that Japan will forcefully occupy Cam Ranh Bay and other key points in southern Vietnam within two or three days. It is believed here that the troops of Lieutenant General Dekoux, the Governor-General of Vietnam, may not resist. The armed forces of Vietnam total approximately 45,000, of which 25,000 are white French, and the rest are Annamese. There are also 50,000 more who can be mobilized. The general opinion in London diplomatic circles is that Japan will occupy Vietnam before attacking Siberia. Non-Soviet sources say that there are sixty Soviet divisions in Siberia, including mechanized units and powerful air forces.

Reuter's, Singapore, 23rd: After arriving here yesterday, Mr. Ingersoll, a spokesman for the New York afternoon newspaper, said that the United States would regard any hostile action against Singapore or any other country in the Pacific as a hostile action against the United States. He does not believe that the United States can allow anyone to invade Singapore. The US President's recent message to Congress requesting an extension of military service is another step closer to inevitable events. The United States will take various actions to prevent Hitler's victory. Mr. Ingersoll will now proceed to Chongqing and Moscow.

Reuter's, Hanoi, 23rd: Mr. Sumida, the leader of the Japanese military mission in Vietnam, met with Vietnamese Governor Dekoux last night. This was the second meeting since Dekoux arrived in Hanoi. The results of the talks are unknown, but it is said that Sumida is currently awaiting new instructions from Tokyo.

Reuter's, Washington, 23rd: Although there is talk of Japanese troops moving north from China towards Outer Mongolia and Siberia, well-informed sources here do not believe that Japan intends to attack Siberia immediately. However, they feel that Japan wants to establish a stronger foothold in Vietnam in order to prepare for future opportunities for development. Today's northward troop movement is nothing more than suiting Japan's wait-and-see policy, preparing to attack the Soviet Union when it is unable to resist Germany, completely collapses, and the Far Eastern Red Army also disintegrates. However, Japan does not seem to expect the Soviet Union to suffer such a defeat.

### Japan Proposes Occupation of Vietnam to Vichy

Reuter's, Hanoi, 23rd: It is heard that as a result of a certain negotiation proposed by the Japanese ambassador in Vichy on July 19, the Vietnamese government has moved back to Hanoi. It is believed that this negotiation is related to the expansion of Japan in southern Vietnam. It is said that the demands made by General Sumida, the leader of the Japanese delegation in Vietnam, are very significant.

Reuter's, Washington, 23rd: It is rumored that Japan issued an ultimatum in Saigon yesterday, with a 24-hour deadline for a response, demanding that Japanese troops completely occupy Vietnam. It is not yet known what steps Vichy will take regarding the Japanese demands. Washington has also made no statement on the matter. The Japanese ultimatum expires today.

Reuter's, Hanoi, 23rd: The official Vietnamese news agency "Alipur" issued a brief important news item last night as follows: "According to London news, Japan has recently made important demands to the Vichy French government regarding Japanese development in southern Vietnam." According to past weeks, rumors have been circulating here that Japan will engage in development in Vietnam, and the authorities have strictly prohibited newspapers from publishing this news. Therefore, no newspaper has mentioned it. This is the first time the ban has been broken. It is said that the sudden publication of this news by the news agency is to implicitly indicate that Japan is about to launch an attack, and it is the first action by the Vietnamese authorities to make the people aware and prepared.

Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd: The Yomiuri Shimbun reported today that the Japanese government should take swift steps to deal with the constant pressure from England and the United States on Thailand and Vietnam. It also stated that if swift action is not taken, Thailand and Vietnam may become serious danger zones for the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The newspaper said that news from Bangkok stated that the British Far East forces have concentrated on the Thai and Burmese borders, attempting to force Thailand to adopt a pro-British policy. The newspaper also said that British and American agents are instigating anti-Japanese sentiment and overthrowing the current pro-Japanese government of Thailand in Bangkok. The newspaper claimed that recently British and Tejer agents have been active in Vietnam, attempting to force Vietnam to break with Japan. Furthermore, the secret military agreement between England, the United States, and Chongqing has made the situation even more dangerous. It is said that according to this agreement, a large number of Chinese troops have concentrated on the northern border of Vietnam.

### British Foreign Secretary Declares Yesterday to Maintain the Integrity of Vietnam and Thailand

Reuter's, London, 23rd: During today's House of Commons meeting, Foreign Secretary Eden was asked to comment on the situation in the South Pacific. Eden replied that the British government has long been aware of rumors that the Japanese government intends to take action to obtain naval and air bases in southern Vietnam. This news coincides with the Japanese newspapers' movement satirizing British plots against Vietnam and Thailand, so its significance is even greater. I now take this opportunity to declare that what the Japanese newspapers report is completely unfounded. Although England has continued to have a small amount of trade with Vietnam since the collapse of France, relations between the two sides have been greatly restricted. As for Thailand, our policy is purely based on the non-aggression treaty signed by the two countries. We have no intention of seizing additional interests, nor do we intend to deal with any third country.

Reuter's, Singapore, 23rd: Regarding Japanese rumors that England intends to take some action in Vietnam, last night the Singapore radio station issued an article in English and French, firmly denying it. It said that the Japanese are spreading this rumor, obviously wanting to use it as an excuse for Japanese actions in Vietnam. Normal trade relations with Vietnam will be maintained, and no attempts that could undermine the position of the Vietnamese authorities will be encouraged. It is now known that Vichy is placing great pressure on Vietnamese Governor Dekoux. We hope that Dekoux can reject it. England will not take any action that could increase the difficulties of Vietnam.

Reuter's, Singapore, 23rd: The Japanese Consul General in Singapore told a Reuter's interviewer today that the situation of Japanese residents here is normal, and there have been no orders from Tokyo to evacuate. He has not received such instructions.

### Willkie Calls For Relief to China

Associated Press, Los Angeles, 23rd: Republican leader Willkie declared at a rally promoted by the United Relief to China Association last night that he believes that providing relief to China is equivalent to maintaining the outposts of American freedom. He urged the audience to learn the lessons of unity from the struggle in the East and combine the dispersed forces. He attacked those who adopted an indifferent attitude, saying that this attitude is the biggest obstacle to national unity. He said, "Fellow countrymen, arise immediately, do not adopt an indifferent attitude again, arise immediately to save the country, to save England, to save China, and to save the democratic world."

### After Making Demands to France, Large Numbers of Japanese Warships Head South; If Southern Vietnam is Occupied, China Will Take Necessary Actions

Reuter's, Chongqing, 23rd: General Yang Xuancheng (transliteration), Director of the Army Intelligence Department, made a statement at a special press conference this afternoon, saying that Japan is now proposing to Vichy the demand for naval and air bases and the landing of troops in southern Vietnam in order to invade Thailand and Burma. Japanese warships and troops are now moving south. According to a telegram from Vichy on the 21st, Japan's demands to Vichy are as follows: (1) Use Cam Ranh Bay as a naval base; (2) Use Saigon as an air base; (3) Troops land and station in southern Vietnam. Yesterday, seven Japanese warships, three aircraft carriers, and fifty-five destroyers were discovered near Kyushu in southern Japan, heading south. At the same time, there were thirty transport ships, escorted by three warships, heading south from 　 Prefecture. The Vichy government is currently rejecting Japan's demands. According to its colonial department, Vietnam will resist any military occupation. When asked what action China would take if Japan invaded southern Vietnam, Yang replied that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement a year ago, on the eve of Japan's occupation of northern Vietnam, stating that China would take necessary measures to defend itself. Yang also said that Japan's southward movement would not hinder its northward attack, because military action in Vietnam only requires a small number of ground troops.

Associated Press, Chongqing, 23rd: Yang Xuancheng (transliteration), Director of the Army Intelligence Department, said that the reported activities of Japanese troops north of the Great Wall do not mean that Japan will necessarily withdraw a large number of troops from mainland China. Yang said that Japan has not withdrawn from Yichang, and pointed out that there are still 150 to 200 bombers in the Hankou area. When the weather in Sichuan was recently favorable, these bombers also made training flights to and from Qingdao. Yang revealed that the Japanese army reduced the number of troops in the team but increased its firepower. The infantry of each division has been reduced from four regiments to three regiments, but the overall firepower has increased. In the past, each company had nine machine guns, but now it has increased to sixteen. Since 1939, six divisions have been transferred back to Japan for this reorganization.

### Sino-British Development Society Established in England; Purely a Commercial Organization Seeking to Increase Mutual Interests

Reuter's, London, 23rd: The Aid China Association held a luncheon, which was well attended. Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Cooperative Society, Mr. Pons, announced the establishment of the Sino-British Development Society. The purpose of this society is to support the industrial cooperative movement in China. He said that he first came into contact with the matter of supporting Chinese cooperatives in 1939. There are many difficulties in this issue, partly due to British legal restrictions, which do not allow direct financial assistance from cooperatives. Today, the Sino-British Development Society is a compromise to deal with this difficulty. The society has several Chinese and British members, many commercial and technical specialists, and several shareholders. This is purely a commercial organization that seeks profits. It has obtained guarantees from the Chinese government before starting business. Currently, most of the business is purchasing machinery for industrial cooperatives and providing loans to cooperative members. In the future, it will focus on exporting Chinese goods to England. Currently, it is in its initial stage, and the scope is still small, but he believes that if this method is promoted throughout the world, it can increase mutual economic interests and become the most stable foundation for peace. The chairman, Dr. Guo Bingwen, detailed the achievements already made by Chinese industrial cooperatives, saying that the current 2,000 cooperatives are one of the brightest scenes in China's resistance and construction.

### Japan Strictly Inspects Telegrams; US Recognizes Significant Meaning

Reuter's, Washington, 23rd: President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that the Japanese government has recently begun to inspect wireless and wired telegrams. When asked if he anticipated any new aggression by Japan in the near future, the President declined to answer, saying that the question should be directed to the State Department. When asked if he considered Japan's inspection to be important, the President replied yes, but did not elaborate. When reporters gathered at the White House to attend the reception, the President's naval adjutant presented the President with a telegram that the Navy Department had just received. The telegram stated that Japan had begun to inspect telegrams.

Associated Press, Washington, 23rd: President Roosevelt said at a press conference yesterday that he believed Japan's strict inspection was of great significance. Japanese authorities have now established new regulations for the use of telephone and telegraph communication lines.

### Malayan Federation Takes Emergency Measures; Merchant Ships Ordered to Arm Themselves to Deal with Any Attack

Reuter's, Bangkok, 23rd: Japanese sources say that according to the "Klong" newspaper, the naval authorities of the Malayan Federation have ordered all merchant ships, especially those over 5,000 tons, to be equipped with anti-aircraft guns and small steel cannons in order to repel any attack. The newspaper also said that the Malayan authorities immediately took this emergency step after the cabinet reshuffle last Sunday.

### Japan Will Hold Emergency Meeting; Shigemitsu Meets Toyoda

Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd: Domei News Agency announced today that the Privy Council will convene an "extraordinary plenary session" within this week to discuss various issues facing the nation. The Privy Council held its regular meeting in the Imperial Palace this morning, attended by the Japanese Emperor and the members of the new Konoe Cabinet.

Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd: Foreign Minister Toyoda today appointed Yamamoto, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as Acting Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and accepted the resignations of Shiraori and Saito, advisors to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Shiraori and Saito were appointed after Matsuoka became Foreign Minister. According to diplomatic conventions, Toyoda is scheduled to meet with foreign diplomats on Friday. Regarding this matter, the Asahi Shimbun reported that Toyoda may use this opportunity to clarify that Japan's foreign policy has not changed and is still based on the Tripartite Pact.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: Japanese Ambassador to England Shigemitsu held a secret two-hour meeting with Foreign Minister Toyoda at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday. It is heard that Shigemitsu has made a detailed report on the situation in England.

### US Willing to Buy Raw Materials from the Soviet Union; But Shipping is Difficult

Reuter's, Washington, 23rd: Jesse Jones, head of the Federal Loan Agency, told reporters yesterday that the United States had stated to Soviet Ambassador to the United States Umansky a week ago that the United States was willing to buy important raw materials that the Soviet Union wanted to sell in order to help the Soviet Union pay for the war materials purchased in the United States. However, he did not know when this transaction could be realized. The only difficulty is transporting raw materials such as manganese and chromium from the Soviet Union to Vladivostok, and then finding ships to transport them to the United States. The US purchases in the Soviet Union do not necessarily have to be equal to what the Soviet Union purchases in the United States. The Soviet Union has a lot of cash and has not requested loans.

Editorial

### New Crisis in the South Pacific

The Japanese cabinet has just been reorganized, and the situation in Vietnam has suddenly become tense. News has been frequently reported in recent days, saying that actions to forcefully occupy Cam Ranh Bay and Saigon are about to be launched within the next two or three days. The movements between Vichy, Hanoi, and Tokyo are also extremely subtle. It is still difficult to predict how the situation will develop in the future, and those who lightly express optimism about the situation in the Far East have already encountered a lesson at this moment.

In his speech on the evening of the 18th, the leader of the new Japanese cabinet claimed that he would implement an autonomous and independent policy, probably indicating that the Japanese government would transcend the Tripartite Alliance and the Neutrality Pact. At that time, newspapers and magazines rarely mentioned this. At the same time, Foreign Minister Toyoda said that he had personally experienced the signing of the Tripartite Pact, so he understood everything clearly. The implied meaning was that he was willing to assume his responsible attitude towards the alliance without fear of shirking. Judging from the meaning of autonomy and independence, it was already somewhat incompatible. In his speech on the 22nd, Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ishii directly stated that Japan's foreign policy would still be centered on the Tripartite Alliance without any change, which was even more different from the expression given by the new cabinet when it was established and the impression it gave people. Coincidentally, the new cabinet had held a liaison meeting with the General Staff Headquarters the day before Ishii's speech. Although the content was not disclosed, it is believed that it was related to Ishii's speech. Furthermore, the actions taken by the new cabinet in its external measures in recent days, such as the troop movements of the Japanese army in China and the frequent contact between the Japanese side and Vietnam, must have been discussed in a joint meeting. The Konoe-Matsuoka cabinet had just collapsed due to its rash foreign policy. The new cabinet intends to act rashly immediately after its establishment, which seems unacceptable to normal reasoning. However, it is only because the old cabinet collapsed due to foreign policy failures that the current cabinet is more eager to achieve quick results to cover up the previous mistakes. There is probably no room for them to do otherwise.

After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, Japan's backward expansion seems to have opened up a new path. Those who were deeply concerned about the strategic pressure of Vladivostok on the Japanese archipelago in the past now have the opportunity to take advantage of the situation to attack and occupy it. However, although the Soviet Union is fiercely resisting the German army and its territory has shrunk, its resistance is becoming more and more vigorous. The Nazi military strength is invincible, but now it is exerting all its strength to invade the Soviet Union, and the achievements are only so-so. This is of great help to the security of the Soviet Union's eastern border. Those who are waiting for opportunities to take advantage of loopholes cannot but harbor deep concern about the evolution of the war situation in the past month. However, looking back at the South Pacific, although the A·B·C·D· united front has been completed, the isolation of Vietnam remains the same. In the strong and strict defense against aggression, only this place has a gap. Moreover, the area is rich in resources and of great importance. Whether invading China or advancing southward, this area is the most important strategic base. Given that the Nazis are in dire need of help today, they will certainly be happy to support turmoil in the South Pacific. On the other hand, it will be difficult to expect them to provide any support to Vichy. In addition, the Japanese authorities may also have high hopes for the appeasement policy that still exists in the international community today, believing that the Western democratic countries that are eager for peace in the Far East may give small favors to show tolerance, and that the gain or loss of Vietnam does not seem to harm the integrity of the interests of Britain and the United States themselves. They are not afraid that they will respond with decisive measures. Therefore, judging from the objective situation. The crisis in Vietnam is indeed a matter of course. Even if the rumors are not entirely reliable, they cannot be regarded as mere scaremongering.

Whether what the Japanese are preparing to impose on Vietnam is peaceful negotiations, military action, or forced negotiations under the threat of force, there is still no clue. The Japanese government's various measures, such as the troop movements in China, the emergency measures for mail ships, the strict inspection of telegrams in the country, and the reluctance to issue overseas Chinese passports and visas, all have the signs of preparing to engage in major actions. On the French-Vietnamese side, there is no power and no intention to resist. The concessions it has made in the past and the psychology of quenching thirst with poison have also made it lack hope for improvement. Yesterday it was reported that England and the United States had reached an agreement on the steps to be taken once Japan occupied French Indochina, which was welcomed by the world. However, judging from the intention of these steps, it can almost be asserted that they are mostly about dealing with the aftermath and less about preventing disasters beforehand. Therefore, the Indochina Peninsula is still in a hopeless position today. If this situation is not quickly improved and prepared for contingencies, then once Cam Ranh Bay and Saigon suffer the same fate as Tokyo and Hanoi, the southward naval and air forces will no longer lack the danger of transshipment ports, and the crisis in Singapore and the Dutch East Indies is even more imminent.

### Spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission Explains the Kuomintang-Communist Incident

Chongqing - Reporter - Reading the *Xinhua Daily's* article of the 22nd, "The Truth About the Actions of the Eighteenth Group Army" (Central News Agency note: the newspaper published on the 22nd, saying it had a Yu (6th) telegram replying to the Ge (5th) telegram of the Military Affairs Department, but used a telegram with an unproven month to shirk the responsibility of replying early, avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial. It is indeed a weak argument. The spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission has opened up each point in the following text, holding them accountable with righteous principles), it is quite suspicious. I visited the spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission again to inquire about the matter. The spokesperson said: (1) On June 25th, the Commission received a telegram from a certain general in the Taiyue front lines, dated Hao (19th) of June, reporting that the Eighteenth Group Army had attacked friendly forces in southeastern Shanxi and seized administrative power. The Military Affairs Department sent a Gan (27th) telegram in the same month to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, ordering him to stop it. After it was sent, there was no reply for a long time. Therefore, a Wei (5th) telegram was sent again in July, ordering compliance. (2) When reporters from your agency visited the other day, I told you this. Unexpectedly, when your agency published the two Mengjin telegrams and one telegram each from Zhengzhou and a certain place in Shandong, obtained by your agency, on July 18th, you placed my words at the head of the four telegrams, entitled "Military News." In fact, the Military Affairs Department only sent telegrams to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De regarding the southeastern Shanxi incident, ordering him to stop it. There were no telegrams for the other two places. Therefore, the original telegram from the Military Affairs Department was published yesterday (20th) to clarify the truth. The above four telegrams all concern matters in June. News reporters, in order to save time and be quick, often do not want to specify the month and day, resulting in providing an excuse for criticism. It is really regrettable. As for the Yu (6th) telegram of July from Commander-in-Chief Zhu published by the *Xinhua Daily*, the Military Affairs Department of this Commission only received it today (July 22nd). It was copied and sent by Qian Zhixian, the director of the Group Army's office in Chongqing, and there was no original telegram. The date on which the office copied and sent it was also written as July 9th. According to my speculation, the Military Affairs Department sent the telegram on July 5th. It would usually take two or three days to reach Commander-in-Chief Zhu's headquarters, about after the 7th, to receive it. At the earliest, it could be replied on the 8th. Now it is said that the telegram was sent Yu, which is not true. There is no such speed. In short, it is indeed a fact that the Dare-to-Die Corps of the Group Army has illegal actions. The Ge telegram of the Military Affairs Department was announced yesterday, and the end of the telegram said, "Cooperate with each other and unite against Japan." This is the greatest purpose of the Commission. I hope you will understand this intention and live up to the expectations of the people. I also have no desire to engage in verbal debates with them, causing laughter and pleasing the enemies," etc. (Telegram of the 22nd)

### Huang Yunlong Sacrifices His Life; Request for Preferential Treatment

Changde - Huang Yunlong, a soldier of Hua's unit, was dispatched on the 11th of last month to reconnaissance behind enemy lines. On the way, he encountered many Japanese soldiers. Huang fought them alone, but because of the disparity in numbers, he was captured by the Japanese. The Japanese army repeatedly used severe torture, but Huang did not answer at all. The Japanese army then killed Huang. Huang was still calm and sacrificed heroically when he faced death. Now the unit has reported the heroic situation of Huang to the higher authorities, requesting preferential treatment to comfort the spirit of the hero. (Telegram of the 21st)

### Hankou Bans English News Businesses; Reuters and *Chu Pao* Forced to Close

Reuters News - Under the Japanese rule in Hankou, the Chinese authorities have virtually banned English news businesses. Reuters and the *Chu Pao*, run by the British, have been forced to cease operations. Ostensibly, the closure of the two places is due to a strike by Chinese employees, but behind the scenes, someone is instigating it. All the Chinese employees of Reuters did not go to work in the office on the morning of July 15th and did not make any requests. It is heard that one of them has been arrested by plainclothes soldiers. Yesterday, the situation suddenly turned serious. According to news received in Shanghai today, the residence of Mr. Que Bart, the publisher of the *Chu Pao* and acting manager of Reuters, was searched by armed men, and it is heard that there was considerable property loss as a result. The Japanese authorities in Hankou denied any knowledge of the matter and refused to take any responsibility. According to the report, this incident started on July 14th when the employees of *Chu Pao* asked the management for a large increase in rice subsidies. The management agreed to consider the matter for two days. The employees had already agreed, but stopped working and left a few minutes later. It was later learned that they were threatened by rioters. Afterwards, according to reliable sources, all employees of the *Chu Pao* are now being held in a Chinese hotel, not allowed to communicate with the outside world. The food and accommodation are quite good, but the security is very strict. The British Consul-General Davidson has urged the municipal government and the Japanese consulate to pay attention to the above threats. At the same time, the management of *Chu Pao* has received news that the following four conditions will be proposed: (1) All employees must be given more freedom to do whatever they want; (2) Employees organize a union; (3) Grant rice subsidies in unspecified amounts; (4) *Chu Pao* merges with the *Wuhan Daily*, only allowing the English translation of the news already published in the Chinese newspaper. Reuters or news from Allied countries are not allowed to be published.

### American Women Leaders Send Joint Letter; Madam Chiang Kai-shek Expresses Respect; Admiring the Brave Spirit of Chinese Women; Signed by Pearl Buck and More Than 30 Others

Chongqing - Thirty-one female committee members who hold leading positions in the United China Relief Council in the United States sent a joint letter to Madam Chiang Kai-shek on the anniversary of the War of Resistance, expressing their respect. The letter praises Madam Chiang Kai-shek as the leader of Chinese women, saying that Madam Chiang Kai-shek has shown lofty courage and spirit for the country in the four years of war, and now holds an extremely important position. We chose July 7th to express the friendship of British women to Chinese women because that day is the anniversary of the Chinese War of Resistance and Construction, celebrating with the country and with the same principles advocated by the American Declaration of Independence. The letter is signed by internationally renowned Ms. Pearl Buck, Mrs. Luth, Mrs. Wilkie, Mrs. Reed, publisher of the *New York Herald Tribune*, and Ms. Ma Shanfei, president of Wellesley College, where Madam Chiang Kai-shek studied in her early years. The original text of the letter is as follows: "Madam Chiang Kai-shek, may I humbly submit, the courage and selflessness shown by women from all walks of life in your country during the four years of heroic anti-aggression war in China are truly admired by American women. The enslaved peoples of the world, as well as those who can still maintain freedom, can now take the heroic model established by the Chinese nation as an example. Especially the actions of Chinese women, because Chinese women today hold an important position in the country. July 7th is the anniversary of your country's War of Resistance and Construction. Your country celebrates on this day the same principles advocated by our Declaration of Independence. Therefore, we believe that it is most appropriate for American women to express their friendship to Chinese women today and wish them a bright future. As the leader of Chinese women, we hereby write this blessing to you." (Telegram of the 22nd)

### Fierce Battles Occur Within Finland; War in Ukraine Shifts Eastward; Germany Makes Pincer Movement on Leningrad; Red Army in Central Region Launches Fierce Counter-Offensive

Reuter's, London, 23rd - According to official reports and other sources, the situation on the Eastern Front this morning is approximately as follows: (1) In Finland, the direction of the German offensive is between Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega. The German objectives are threefold: First, to isolate the Soviet forces in the north; second, to bypass Lake Ladoga and attack the rear of the Leningrad defense line; third, to threaten the canal through which Soviet warships pass from the Gulf of Finland to the White Sea. (2) Leningrad area: The Soviet official report did not mention Pskov. The battle 45 miles east of that place is not enough to indicate that the German army has made progress. (3) Smolensk area: According to neutral sources, the Soviet army is currently launching a fierce counter-offensive east of the city. Last night, German radio broadcasts also stated that Soviet artillery fire was extremely fierce. (4) Ukraine: Soviet sources say that there is fierce fighting 80 miles west of Kyiv. The German side says that German, Hungarian, and Slovak troops are currently pursuing the Soviet army.

United Press, Moscow, 23rd - According to yesterday's news, the German army, which has been fighting on the Ukrainian front for ten days, suddenly invaded the Jitomir area, 20 miles west of Kyiv, yesterday. The Soviet High Command issued an official report describing the "large-scale" battle situation in the Jitomir area. Since the war began, this official report first mentioned this area yesterday, indicating that the Soviet army has retreated 68 miles. The official report also mentioned the fierce battles in the Smolensk area and the northeast and south areas of Leningrad. However, the official report still stated that the position of the Finnish front line has not changed in practice. The official report also stated that there are fierce battles in Pokov, 145 miles south of Leningrad, and Petrozafotsk, 200 miles northeast of Leningrad, east of Lake Ladoga.

TASS, Moscow, 23rd - Fierce battles last night and this morning in four areas: Petrozafotsk, Pokov, Smolensk, and Jitomir in Ukraine. The Soviet Air Force fiercely bombed enemy airfields and fought with enemy aircraft. 39 enemy aircraft were destroyed, and the Soviet Union lost 17 aircraft.

Reuter's, London, 22nd - According to the latest news from the Eastern Front, the Soviet army is currently fighting fiercely to contain the new German offensive to invade Leningrad, Moscow, and Kyiv from three routes. Fierce battles took place all day yesterday in the Smolensk salient. It is heard that the German army in the area attempted to launch a large encirclement operation against the Soviet army in the Nibel River Bay area. The recent Soviet official report said that the Soviet army in Ukraine has retreated from Novograd Volynsky near the old border of 1938 to Jitomir (85 miles west of Kyiv). The German army, which is making a pincer attack on Leningrad, is still being blocked in the southeast of Lake Peipus, but the German army advancing from Finland has entered the 80-mile wide isthmus between Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega. The Soviet official report mentioned this line for the first time, saying that there are currently battles around Petrozafotsk (Petrozavodsk), 110 miles northeast of Leningrad, on the railway to Murmansk. It is heard that Soviet paratroopers have landed behind the Finnish-German front line. On Tuesday, 87 German aircraft were shot down, and the Soviet Union lost only 14 aircraft. Moscow Radio Station said that according to the latest figures, 22 German aircraft were shot down in the night attack on Moscow on Monday. The latest German official report stated that the German army and Allied forces broke through the Soviet defense line, dividing the Soviet defenders into multiple teams, unable to adjust. Although the Soviet army made local fierce resistance and launched fierce counter-offensives, the enemy army is now unable to adjust its command. The German army on the entire front is constantly carrying out its war to completely annihilate the isolated Soviet army.

### German Aircraft Attack on Soviet Capital Fails; Stalin Commends Air Defense Personnel

TASS, Moscow, 23rd - Late yesterday night, 150 German aircraft again raided Moscow, but still failed. Our Air Force defense team and anti-aircraft fire prevented most of the German aircraft from reaching Moscow. Only a few German aircraft broke into the city's airspace. Several houses in the city caught fire and were extinguished by firefighters and the public. Only two hospitals were more severely damaged. Military targets were not damaged. According to preliminary statistics, 15 enemy aircraft were shot down by our night flying fighters and anti-aircraft guns.

Reuter's, Berlin, 22nd - German official news agency news, another powerful German Air Force fleet bombed Moscow's important military targets last night. According to current reports, fires were seen everywhere after the first batch of German aircraft dropped bombs.

Havas, Moscow, 22nd - Stalin recently issued an order in the name of the People's Commissar of Defense, praising the Moscow air defense forces for their actions during the bombing by German aircraft last night. The text reads, "Last night, the German aircraft group attempted to bomb Moscow. Fortunately, due to the diligence of the local air defense forces, no damage was suffered. The enemy aircraft were discovered early and were shot down by our fighter jets and anti-aircraft guns before they reached Moscow. The searchlight units were also able to perform their duties. More than 200 German aircraft in batches raided the capital and were all dispersed by us. Only a few broke into the city's airspace and dropped a few bombs, which immediately caught fire and spread. After being watered by the fire brigade, they were quickly extinguished. According to reports from all parties, a total of 22 German aircraft were shot down. The People's Committee of Defense expresses its appreciation for (1) the anti-aircraft gun team, searchlight team, and observation team, (2) night fighter jets, (3) the fire brigade and other public officials, all of whom are loyal to their duties, and ordered the Moscow Garrison Command to register the responsible personnel and report them so that they can be praised one by one.

Reuter's, Berlin, 23rd - Yesterday afternoon, the German official news agency mentioned for the first time the German aircraft's air raid on Moscow. It is said that the German bomber and dive bomber team continuously attacked from dusk to dawn, dropping thousands of various high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs on Moscow's military important targets. A large fire was seen south of the Moscow River. According to reports, there were 12 explosions near the Kremlin. This attack can be compared with the most fierce forest bombing carried out against military important targets in the United Kingdom.

According to the German official report, the German aircraft's attack on Moscow was to retaliate for the Soviet aircraft's bombing of the "undefended capitals" of Roumania and Finland. The German bombers, in teams of twelve, continuously bombed military facilities, munitions, and factories. The Kremlin and the Moscow River Bay area were hit by bombs and caught fire.

### Red Army in Leningrad Area Defends Strongly

United Press, Vichy, 23rd - French newspaper military analysts said yesterday that they expect a long war between Germany and the Soviet Union for Leningrad. The *Kleran Frante Post* said that Leningrad is a modern city with a strong defense. The city of one million people is surrounded by strong defense projects covering 30 square miles. The deployment of turrets, tanks, and landmines extends north to Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of Finland, and west to the Folda Mountains, the Lalhua River, the Folika River, and Lake Peipus. The Stalin defense line also includes Leningrad. The fortresses are located as far as Pskov. The fortress seems to be still in the hands of the Soviet army. According to news arriving here, there were fierce artillery sounds from the Hanko Island yesterday morning. French military analysis believes that the artillery sounds are sufficient evidence to attack Hanko. The Soviet Union occupied Hanko Island in 1940, and today it has become an outpost of Leningrad. The ports of the Gulf of Finland stretch for 950 miles. When the Soviet Union can hold Pskov, it is impossible for the Germans to advance from the south to Leningrad.

### Odessa and Leningrad Attacked by German Aircraft Fleets

TASS, Moscow, 23rd - The *News* published details of the air battle near Leningrad as follows: "The command issued a notice: 'Enemy aircraft are flying towards Leningrad. Soviet pilots take off immediately.' Soon, eight enemy bombers and ten fighter jets were seen approaching the city's airspace. The Soviet pilots responded resolutely and, after the battle began, ten young pilots, including Gorovying, Qin Chengke, and Chimo Danov, each shot down one enemy aircraft. Adjutant Pekelin flew behind ten enemy aircraft and shot down the enemy aircraft with direct fire. The enemy fighters rushed forward in an attempt to assist, but it was too late. The bomber had already fallen to the ground. Adjutant Nikitin moved forward to attack the enemy fighter. The enemy resisted stubbornly, and soon another 'Misaschmitt' fired machine guns at the aircraft. Nikitin fought hard, and the enemy aircraft caught fire and fell. Adjutant Krikov fought with the invaders, creating an unprecedented record. He was attacked by several enemies at the same time. Krikov shot down one enemy aircraft, and then, because he ran out of ammunition, he rammed an enemy aircraft. As a result, Krikov escaped, and the enemy aircraft fell. Some of the remaining enemy aircraft fell at our airfield."

Haitong News, Berlin, 23rd - German bomber fleets attacked the port of Odessa yesterday. The military facilities in the west were hit and burned, and the fire spread all over the sky. Explosions were heard from far away. Several oil pools were bombed, and the smoke filled the air.

### Japanese Military Observers Praise Red Army Tactics

Reuter's, Washington, 23rd - The reliable news about Soviet operations that has reached Washington comes from the Far East, because the only foreign soldiers allowed to inspect the Soviet front lines are Japanese military officers. The Japanese military officers' reports express deep admiration for the methods used by the Red Army, saying that the Soviet army defends its positions and only retreats when it is absolutely necessary, and that it does so in an orderly manner, and then attacks the flanks and rear of the German army. Japanese observers also praised the appropriateness of the Soviet army's actions, even though they said that Leningrad and Kyiv would be captured and the German army would eventually reach Moscow, they believed that some of the Red Army would retreat east of Moscow and continue to fight.

### German Army Uses Poison Gas; Soviet Union Obtains Evidence

TASS, Moscow, 23rd - On July 15, during operations west of Sitnya, our army captured secret documents and chemical equipment from the Second Battalion of the 52nd Chemical Corps of the enemy. Among the captured packages was Instruction No. ND-199, "Chemical Bomb Application Method." This instruction was issued in 1940 and was only distributed to various departments on June 11 of this year. These documents provide detailed guidance on the use of poison gas. The teaching method states that this type of chemical army must use the new No. 40 mortar and various new chemical mines. The secret German documents captured by the Red Army prove that the German army foresaw that the blitzkrieg strategy would inevitably fail and had to resort to poison gas. German troops and special units have used poison gas. Therefore, the German side has violated its own Geneva Convention signed in 1929, which was established in 1925 and prohibits all countries from using poison gas.

United Press, Berlin, 23rd - A German authoritative military spokesperson declared last night that the German army has broken through the Soviet defense line and reached outposts 150 miles beyond the upper reaches of the Nibel River. The German army is obviously continuing to advance eastward towards Moscow. It is learned that the German armored forces are about 125 miles to 155 miles from the Soviet capital.

### British Aircraft Brave Heavy Thunderstorms to Attack German Industrial Areas; British Air Force Expands Scope of Activities

Reuter's, London, 23rd - The Ministry of Aviation official report said that British bombers continued to attack enemy industrial areas in the Rhine region last night in heavy thunderstorms. The main targets were still the cities of Frankfurt and Mönchengladbach. Several other industrial areas in western Germany were also bombed. Another team of British bombers raided the Dunkirk dockyard, causing great losses. All British aircraft returned to defense safely.

Reuter's, London, 23rd - Air Minister Sir Sinclair declared in the House of Commons today that the scope of activities of the British Air Force during the day and night is now expanding day by day. The evidence of the damage caused is accumulating day by day and will be published as soon as it is obtained. In addition to carrying out fierce attacks at night, the British Air Force also forces enemy aircraft to fight during the day and causes significant damage to enemy factories, transportation, and ships. What is more important is that we are now forcing the enemy to maintain a large number of air forces on the Western Front to resist our increasingly fierce attacks. Someone asked whether the British Air Force's attack was effective in supporting the Soviet Union. Sinclair replied that I think it is best not to publish the information we have obtained about the German Air Force's actions, but our Air Force's continuous attacks day and night have given the Germans a great deal of pressure, and we know that this has had a great impact on the morale of the German people.

### German Troops Stationed in Norway Mutiny; 130 Killed

Reuter's, London, 23rd - According to the Norwegian News Agency, the German troops stationed in Kverven, near Bergen, Norway, recently mutinied, resulting in 130 German soldiers being killed. The mutiny took place at the Kverven Fortress, which guards the entrance to Bergen Port. The mutiny was quite large.

### V Movement Appears in New York Sky; Symbol of Victory for Democracy

Reuter's, New York, 23rd - The V movement appeared in the American sky for the first time yesterday. Six large aircraft of the American Airlines formed a V shape and flew in the New York sky, making the public know that this is a symbol of victory for democracy. This not only responds to the British victory movement but also aims to promote the movement to collect aluminum for national defense purposes.

### Feilinder Appointed Czech Envoy to the Soviet Union
     Reuters, London, 23rd - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that after the signing of an agreement between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia to restore diplomatic relations, Feilinder, the former Czech envoy to the Soviet Union, has been re-appointed as the Czech envoy to the Soviet Union. Feilinder is currently in London and will soon depart for Moscow.

 Savings Promotion Committee: A Summary of One Year's Work
     Recent statistics show over 400 million yuan in savings, with over 800 savings promotion branches established.

     Chongqing - The National Savings for National Reconstruction Promotion Committee has been established for a full year since its establishment on July 23rd of last year. The work of the past year has been quite effective. A summary of the main points is as follows: (1) The amount of savings promoted has shown a clear upward trend with each stage of the savings competition. In the first phase of this year, on January 28th, it was over 210 million yuan, increasing to over 310 million yuan by the end of April, an average increase of about 1 million yuan per day. Recent statistics at the end of June have exceeded 400 million yuan, an average increase of about 1.5 million yuan per day. Development has taken place both domestically and overseas. (2) Regarding the establishment of the savings promotion network, in addition to the 17 provincial and municipal branch committees already established, savings promotion is being carried out by provincial savings groups and overseas savings groups. Furthermore, personnel have been sent to border areas and provinces near the front lines to assess the situation and plan for the widespread establishment of more branches. At the grassroots level, over 854 city and county savings promotion branches have been established. Provincial branch committees are currently dispatching personnel to inspect and guide, and work is being earnestly promoted. (3) An example of improving savings promotion methods is the recent mobilization of the public to organize savings practice societies. The progress of savings promotion work requires cultivating both a spirit of frugality and savings habits simultaneously. Group savings require relying on the savings groups organized by institutions and organizations, and then extending them to the more dispersed general public. This led to the initiation of practice societies, so that everyone can participate. Currently, the goal is to recruit 1 million members nationwide this year, and gradually expand in stages in the future, using existing members to refer new members, which will be easier to spread to all levels of society. (4) The strength of savings promotion has been repeatedly strengthened due to the organization of savings groups and the initiation of practice societies by leaders from the party, government, military, and various sectors. Recently, the assistance provided by the three departments of the Central Organization and Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Social Affairs of the Executive Yuan's Economic Council has been even greater. Furthermore, the participation of women's work cadres in work in various places and the active development of overseas savings groups have been particularly effective in leveraging their strength among their respective target audiences. After the National Financial Conference passed a resolution to list the promotion of savings as the central task of financial authorities in various provinces and cities, the strength of savings promotion should increase even more. Overall, the success of past savings efforts is due to the widespread development achieved through the cooperation of all parties. (22nd dispatch)

 Far East Situation Appears Tense: Japanese Ships Refuse to Publicize Sailing Schedules
 Foreigners Traveling to Japan Face Strict Restrictions; Rumors of Japan Drafting Ship Management Plan

 Following the frantic dumping of US dollars by Yokohama Specie Bank in Japan, it is generally speculated that Japan will undoubtedly take an adventurous action leaning towards the Axis powers in the near future, fearing that the US will freeze its funds once it is launched, so it is dumping US dollars. After this sign was discovered, the Japanese side simultaneously stopped issuing passports for foreigners to travel to Japan and announced that the Japan Mail Steamship Co. would be placed under a state of emergency, suspending the sale of passenger tickets for Japanese ships to Japan. As a result of these measures, the situation in the Far East has become increasingly tense, which should be of concern to Chinese and foreign people.

 Adopting British Shipping Methods

 It was learned yesterday that Japanese shipping companies have received instructions from the Japanese headquarters and authorities to stop announcing ship schedules in newspapers from yesterday (the 23rd). Japanese shipping has therefore been placed under an "emergency" status. In the future, the names of Japanese ships coming to Shanghai or exporting will no longer be specified, and only the approximate schedules of the ships will be announced.

 Original Schedules to Be Changed

 Personnel from major Japanese shipping companies in Shanghai, including Japan Mail Steamship Co. and Dalian Steamship Co., confirmed this information yesterday, stating that the previous practice of announcing ship schedules in newspapers every day will be changed. The reasons for this change are unknown, and it is only known that this step was taken based on instructions from the transportation headquarters and Japanese authorities. According to an employee of a Japanese shipping company, the reason for this change is unclear, but it is expected to return to normal within a few days.

 Foreigners Must Obtain Approval to Travel to Japan

 Foreigners who purchase tickets to Japan from Japanese shipping companies must have the approval of the Japanese consulate here, otherwise they will no longer be able to purchase tickets. According to reliable sources, foreigners in Shanghai who intend to travel to Japan will not be able to obtain approval from the Japanese consulate until next week. The Japanese authorities have not explained the reason for this. Officials at the Japanese consulate did not issue any official statements when questioned by reporters, but it is reliably known that since the beginning of this week, foreigners seeking approval from the Japanese consulate to travel to Japan have not been successful.

 Japan to Control All Ships

 A Tokyo dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 23rd reported that, according to reliable sources, the Japanese government, in order to deal with the ship situation, will stipulate that private ships will be subject to state management. This plan is being drafted by the Shipping Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, stipulating that the government will lease all ships to be operated by certain shipping companies, navigating on routes designated by the government, and giving priority to the country's urgent needs.

 Suppressing Grain Prices: Effective Government Sanctions

 Plan to Formulate Monthly Price Stabilization Measures Covering Materials, Wages, Transportation, and Finance

 The government authorities of our country are deeply concerned about the rise and fall of grain prices in various places. It is generally believed that the frequent rise in grain prices is due to the fact that land and water transportation are not smooth, and goods cannot be transferred and adjusted to each other. On the other hand, it is due to the fact that unscrupulous merchants, blinded by profit, are taking advantage of the situation, resulting in illegal transactions becoming increasingly rampant. It is believed that the spiraling rise in grain prices not only affects the livelihood of civilians and social security, but also hinders established national policies. The government authorities previously ordered the Economic Council of the Executive Yuan to formulate a four-month plan to stabilize prices, which has now begun to be implemented. The content is divided into four parts: materials, wages, transportation, and finance, with the relevant responsible agencies cooperating to complete the work gradually before the end of October. Therefore, speculative merchants in various industries, if they do not wake up again, will quickly release their stockpiled goods gradually, and will subsequently suffer serious losses and blows.

 Zhen Zuobi's Astrology Lecture: A Brief Explanation of Leap Months and Leap Years

 I have perused ancient and modern calendars and respectfully studied Western translations. I have learned that both Chinese and foreign lunar and solar calendars have intercalation. The only difference is that the lunar calendar has leap months, and the solar calendar has leap years. However, the intercalation methods of the two calendars have mutual bases. Those who specialize in using the lunar calendar as a standard are making superficial statements. The calendars of various countries are based on two points: one is to record the year, and the other is to tell the time. Recording the year is determined according to the needs of the times and is occasionally reformed. Telling the time means that the alternation of spring and autumn is constant and unchanging throughout history. Astrologers belong to the latter, so they are not bound by lunar leap months or solar leap years. They can both evolve into stems and branches.

 The lunar calendar has been used in our country since the time of Emperor Xuanyuan. "Zhen Zuobi examines that Xuanyuan ordered the historian Rongcheng to create the calendar." It was rectified during the Xia Dynasty. During the Zhou and Qin dynasties, some used the Jianzi and Jianchou months instead of the Jianyin month as the first month of the year. This is what the previous article referred to as the evolution of recording the year, which has nothing to do with solar terms. The lunar calendar's intercalation method is based on the dark, new, waxing, and full moons. The moon is called dark when it disappears. The moon is called new when it reappears. The waxing and waning phases of the moon regulate its roundness. The moon is opposite the sun when it is full. Generally, the distance between new moons is 29 and a half days. Therefore, a large month has 30 days, and a small month has 29 days. The average is 354 days per year. Adding the odd number, there is a difference of about 11 days per year. By the third year, a leap month must be added. Two leap months are added every five years, still based on this.

 The solar calendar originated in Egypt. At first, no intercalation was performed, so the seasons were disordered. When Gregory reformed the calendar, he established an intercalation system. The solar calendar currently used worldwide is the Gregorian calendar. Its method is based on the Earth revolving around the sun for 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, and 9 seconds per year. However, when calculated based on solar terms, the distance between vernal equinoxes differs by 20 minutes and 20 seconds each year. The difference accumulates for four years to become a leap day "weak." Although a leap day is added every four years, it is still not enough. Therefore, one leap day must be omitted every 100 years. The fourth 100 years "strong" does not omit it. After 800 leap days, there must be a one-day difference in 3,000 years. Therefore, world calendar scholars believe that the current Gregorian calendar is still not perfect and are thinking of reforming it.

 My humble opinion is that no matter how advanced the lunar and solar calendar methods are, although they differ in recording the year and intercalating, they are the same in telling the time and determining solar terms. For example, the Japanese calendar New Year's Day is printed in our newspaper's advertisement column. On the occasion of this leap month, I am restating the outline.

 Japanese Military Spokesman's Defense

 Boasting That Military Resources Have Not Been Exhausted, Ambiguous About the Strength of the Invasion of China

 According to the Zi Lin Western Newspaper, yesterday (the 22nd), Japanese military spokesman Kunio Akiyama claimed at a reception for reporters that the German invasion of the Soviet Union was the same as the Japanese invasion of China, but the Japanese military force in China was only one-sixth or one-seventh of the Nazi force that entered the Soviet Union. He therefore admitted that the Japanese military would transfer reserve troops to cope with the new situation, using this as an analogy to boast that Japan's military resources had not "dried up." At this point, a reporter asked Akiyama why he mentioned the German invasion of the Soviet Union and whether there was a special reason. He claimed that it was because there were many similarities between the two. When asked how many troops the Germans had in the invasion of the Soviet Union, the spokesman evaded the question, claiming that he did not know. Someone then stood up and asked how it was known that the Japanese military force in China was only one-sixth of the German force attacking the Soviet Union. Akiyama smiled and said that he only knew the approximate size of the German force, so he was speaking approximately about the size of the two forces. A reporter then mustered his spirit again and continued to ask what Akiyama knew about the general estimate. The spokesman said that he could not provide this general estimate, and this question came to an end. Akiyama also replied to another reporter's inquiry that the British army in Malaya would not enter Vietnam.

 A Foreign Passenger on a China National Aviation Corporation Flight: A Letter Describing a Thrilling Experience

 More Than 200 Bombs Dropped by Japanese Planes, Yet the Fuselage of the China National Aviation Corporation Plane Remained Intact

 The Zi Lin Newspaper reported that a China National Aviation Corporation plane was bombed by Japanese planes near Xufu, Sichuan on May 20th. At the time, three American passengers and many other passengers on the plane had escaped and were unharmed. One of the passengers recently sent a letter to a foreigner in Shanghai describing the details of the bombing, stating that the China National Aviation Corporation plane was a Douglas DC-2 passenger plane flying from Chongqing to Chengdu. En route, it encountered Japanese planes. The pilot immediately landed the plane, but it was still discovered by the Japanese planes, which then indiscriminately dropped bombs on the landing site, no less than 212 bombs. One bomb hit the right wing of the China National Aviation Corporation plane. Fortunately, all the passengers had left the plane and fled into the mountains. Subsequently, a rescue plane was dispatched from Hong Kong to carry the passengers to their destination. A portion of the letter is recorded as follows:

 Heard Alarm Mid-Flight and Landed in Xufu

 We departed at 9:30 AM and had only been flying for 12 minutes when Chongqing issued an air raid alert. We heard on the radio that six squadrons of Japanese planes were approaching, four of which were flying towards our plane. Our plane changed course, and an hour and a half later, flew to Xufu and landed. We left the plane and sat down to wait for further news. News quickly arrived that Japanese planes were flying directly towards our plane. The passengers and crew left the airport and fled into the mountains. Soon after, 26 Japanese planes arrived. We held our breath and waited for the unavoidable to happen.

 Pigs, Sheep, and Chickens Were Bombed to Death

 Japanese planes dropped 212 bombs near us. The explosive force was terrifying, and the aftershocks almost lifted us off the ground. The right wing of the China National Aviation Corporation plane was penetrated by a bomb. Dozens of bombs fell around the plane, but the fuselage did not catch fire, which was also miraculous. We did not have time to retrieve our luggage, which was all left on the plane. Fortunately, there were no losses, which was quite gratifying. The soil and stones were bombed and fell on the foothills. No one was injured or killed, but two pigs, two sheep, and several chickens were bombed to death.

 Spent a Night in a Hotel and Flew to Chengdu the Next Morning

 We then saw the car oil tank near the plane catch fire and thought the plane would be burned, but the flames did not spread to the plane. A nearby house and barracks also caught fire and were being extinguished. We found an inn half a mile away, had dinner, took a bath, and had mosquito nets, so we spent the night there. The next morning, a plane flew from Hong Kong, and we boarded the plane and flew away from Xufu amidst the air raid sirens, arriving safely in Chengdu.

 Zhu Xiaochun Leaves Shanghai for Chongqing

 Zhu Xiaochun, a professor and director of training at Shanghai Law College, is strict and upright in his training of students, and has gained a reputation since taking office. Unexpectedly, this attracted attention, and Zhu left Shanghai for Chongqing a few days ago due to the deteriorating environment.

 Smooth Transportation Between Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Rangoon

 Exchange Damaged Banknotes as Much as Possible

 100-Yuan Banknotes Without Place Names: Fully Accepted in the Market

 Various trade associations in Shanghai have noted that many merchants refuse to accept damaged legal tender and subsidiary currency notes circulating in the market. They have telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting that the Shanghai branches of the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) be ordered to exchange them as much as possible to relieve the difficulties of merchants. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance has ordered the four banks to exchange them as much as possible in accordance with the "Measures for Exchanging Damaged Banknotes" established by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee. It is also heard that among the 100-yuan banknotes circulating in the city, those issued by the Bank of China are the most common, followed by the Bank of Communications, and then the Farmers Bank of China. These 100-yuan banknotes without place names are now fully accepted. Those printed with the place name Chongqing are temporarily not accepted by banks, but small money shops exchange them at a discount. It is heard that most of these 100-yuan banknotes with the place name Chongqing are transported from Ningbo.

 Capro Arrives in Shanghai This Morning

 The new cargo ship Capro, managed by Fulaide Foreign Company, with a deadweight of 3,127 tons, was ordered to sail to the Far East. It has departed from Los Angeles and will arrive in Shanghai this morning fully loaded with American goods. Other ships such as the Collinsworth wheel will continue to come to Shanghai. American ships will reduce the number of times they pass through Japan, as the American authorities believe that in the current war situation, Americans refuse to buy Japanese goods, and the transportation of American goods to Japan has also decreased, so there is no need to sail back and forth between them.

Yesterday morning, the Taikoo Company's Yuezhou wheel transported another 10,000 bags of American rice from Hong Kong and is now moored at the Bund Wharf in the French Concession. According to news from the rice market, the market price of small ground rice has fallen back to 103-104 yuan. The Public Works Department's selling price of American rice is likely to fall back to the original price of 110 yuan soon.

 Accumulate Virtue for Future Generations and Cultivate National Strength

 Mr. Cheng Zhiliang, Director of the Trust Department of Huizhong Bank, wrote a letter saying, "I was an orphan since childhood and was raised by society. I am able to stand on my own in society today. Whenever I think of this, I always think of repaying society. Therefore, I have been working and running around for various public welfare organizations for several years, driven by my conscience and not daring to slack off. Now I see that your newspaper is organizing a scholarship fund for readers, and I am very impressed by the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life. With the general manager of our bank, Mr. Huang Yuzhai, contributing a huge amount of money to advocate for it, I am even more personally inspired. Therefore, I told the Yan brothers about this matter, and they generously donated 900 yuan in total, with the aim of nurturing talents. I will contribute 100 yuan from my savings to make up a total of 1,000 yuan. (Omitted) In the future, I am willing to continue to solicit donations from friends during my spare time, and I will send them to you when I have achieved something. I believe that Shanghai is a major commercial port and is not lacking in wealthy people. If everyone can do their best to benefit young people who have dropped out of school, it will not only accumulate virtue for future generations, but also cultivate national strength, which is of no small importance."

 Free Treatment for Neurasthenia

 Mr. Tu Qihua wrote a letter saying, "Your newspaper's publication of the reader's scholarship fund is admirable. I recently read Mr. Huang Yuzhai's sincere letter to relatives and friends, and I was deeply moved. I am a doctor and can barely make ends meet. Now I respectfully save on wasteful expenses and donate 100 yuan to show my support. Thinking of the students who are poor and study harder every day, and those who suffer from neurasthenia, there are quite a few. I am willing to have the International Sanatorium, which I run, provide free examination and treatment for these students who receive your newspaper's scholarship fund, as a special treatment, but it must be introduced by your newspaper, limited to 50 people for the time being."

 Zhengzhong Women's Middle School Responds to the Righteous Deed

Since its establishment, the school has been known for its serious teaching and practical standards.

 Lixing Tobacco Company Temporarily Suspends Production

 Workers Demand Maintenance Fees; Negotiations Between the Two Sides Fail to Reach Agreement

 The Huacheng Tobacco Company's manufacturing plant in Shanghai, formerly located on Huishan Road in Hongkou, was destroyed by the August 13th artillery fire. All the company's products, such as Golden Mouse and Beautiful brand cigarettes, were manufactured by Lixing Tobacco Company at 1022 Peng Road. Lixing Tobacco Company was founded by Bao Gengsheng from Ningbo. In addition to manufacturing cigarettes for other companies, it does not have products sold on the market. It employs more than 600 male and female workers, about half of whom, about 300, are former workers of Huacheng Tobacco Company. Recently, Huacheng Tobacco Company has established a new factory at the intersection of Gordon Road and Changping Road, and it is heard that it has started manufacturing cigarettes. All the former workers of Huacheng have been rehired by the factory. Lixing Tobacco Company has to temporarily suspend work because Huacheng has set up its own factory. It plans to launch new brand cigarettes for sale and will resume work once preparations are complete. However, the approximately 300 workers employed by Hexing Tobacco Company were extremely alarmed when they heard this news. Because at a time when prices are high, the factory's closure means that workers will not be able to maintain their livelihoods. Yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM, representatives were sent to the company to request that each person be paid a living allowance of 60 yuan per month during the shutdown period, but the factory has only agreed to pay 30 yuan per person, which the workers said they would not accept.

 Continued Stalemate

 Until 9:00 PM, no solution was reached. Later, the factory, fearing an accident, called the police station, which dispatched a large number of detectives in police cars to the scene to maintain order. After the workers were persuaded by the police officers, they dispersed and will negotiate with the company again today.

 The End of the Road for Speculative Merchants: Seeking to Sell Off Large Stocks of Goods

 The Tobacco Exchange Market Is Sluggish

 According to those familiar with the tobacco exchange market, speculative merchants are now entrusting middlemen to sell off their stockpiles at market prices to realize cash, but buyers are generally tired and unwilling to buy high-priced stockpiles. Therefore, the sales of various daily necessities in the tobacco exchange market, such as soap, matches, kerosene, and candles, are far exceeding demand. Due to the lack of buyers, sales are sluggish. The prices of various daily necessities may continue to fall. At the same time, due to the impact of high selling prices, the general public is saving on expenses. On the contrary, various daily necessities manufacturers have increased production to ensure that there are sufficient goods on the market and to jointly stabilize the market situation.

 The Public Works Department's New Business Tax: To Be Implemented Next Month

 Annual Revenue May Increase by 7 Million Yuan; Autonomous Fire Has Decided to Reduce Surcharges

 The Public Concession Public Works Department, in order to cope with a very large budget deficit this year, established a Tax System Reform Committee to study ways to increase revenue and proposed the collection of special business taxes.

It is heard that the amount of the reduction is 36% and is planned to be implemented from August 1st. Regarding the case of collecting special business taxes, although the Japanese newspapers claim that the British and American sides have expressed strong opposition, it is still uncertain whether the case will be approved. However, the outcome is still unknown yesterday. It is expected that the official will issue a communiqué today. It is heard that if the case is approved, it is expected that the tax will be collected from August 1st. It is estimated that the revenue from this new tax will reach 7 million yuan per year.

 Three Thieves Rob a Money Shop Partner; People and Stolen Goods Are Captured Together

 One Thief Shot and Captured for Resisting Arrest; One Thief Captured Alive and Stolen Military Tickets Are Seized

 Yesterday morning, a robbery of a pedestrian with a large sum of money occurred on Guangxi Road in the bustling Public Concession. After the detectives pursued, the thief opened fire to resist arrest. As a result, one thief was injured, one thief was captured alive, and one thief escaped. The detailed situation is recorded below:

 Carrying a Large Sum of Money to Exchange Military Tickets

 At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, Yi Tai Money Shop (specializing in buying and selling banknotes from various countries) in Room 201, 2nd Floor, Taihe Building, 81 Lloyd Road, sent its partner, Tong Qibiao from Shaoxing, carrying 330 yuan in Japanese military ticket coins in a gray canvas bag to Tai Money Shop, 595 Jiujiang Road, to exchange for 5-yuan and 10-yuan Japanese military banknotes. Because the shop refused to exchange them, Tong carried them back to the shop.

 Three Bandits Rob Partner and Call the Police

 Unexpectedly, three bandits were lying in ambush nearby. Seeing Tong carry the money and come out again, they immediately followed him. At the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Guangxi Road, one bandit pointed a gun to block his way and snatched all the money, carrying the loot to the west. Tong was suddenly robbed and unwilling to give up, so he shouted "Robber" from behind. Two patrolmen, No. 1920 and No. 2975, nearby heard the alarm and stepped forward to pursue. The bandits knew that things were bad, and one bandit turned around and opened fire at the patrolmen. The two patrolmen returned fire.

 One Thief Injured and One Thief Captured Alive

 At that time, bullets were flying and pedestrians fled in panic. As a result, one of the thieves was shot in the back and injured and fell to the ground. He was captured on the spot, and a loaded pistol and all the stolen money were seized. Another thief escaped to the entrance of the Continental Eye Hospital on Jiujiang Road and was arrested. Another thief escaped into the crowd and disappeared. After the incident, the police sent the injured thief to the hospital for treatment. According to him, his name is Wang Baohua, from Ningbo, 30 years old. The arrested thief is named Tang Jinpei, 29 years old, from Wuxi. He was taken into custody for questioning. It is learned that another escaped thief was also captured in a small hotel.

 Breaking Up a Gang That Blackmailed Cotton Shops

 Three Pistols Seized

 Extortionists Zhou Zhenming, Fang Bingyan, Qin Bingjun, and others gathered many accomplices and recently organized a blackmail and extortion gang specializing in sending letters to major foreign goods and cotton shops in the concession in the city, extorting large sums of money and dividing the money among themselves. Last month, four cotton shops, including Rixin Sheng Cotton Shop, 166 Avenue Edward VII, Ri Xinzeng Cotton Shop, 114 Avenue Edward VII, Hengfeng Cotton Shop in Bazin Bridge, and Xiangyuan Cotton Shop, received threatening letters from them, demanding huge sums of money and setting a deadline for payment, otherwise they would be dealt with by different means. The cotton shops paid more than 23,000 yuan after receiving the threatening letters. A few days ago, when Zhou Zhenming and others were holding a meeting in a room on the 5th floor of the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, the French police learned of it and ordered detectives to go to the address with Chinese and Western detectives from the Public Concession police to arrest Zhou Zhenming, Fang Bingyan, Qin Bingjun, and the woman Zhou Chen Liying (Zhou Zhenming's mistress), etc. According to them, three pistols and many bullets were seized from Zhou Zhenming's residence and taken to the French police station for investigation. Zhou Zhenming and others admitted to sending threatening letters to the above-mentioned merchants to extort money and dividing the 23,000 yuan among themselves. The French police are conducting a strict investigation for prosecution. (Huaguang News Agency)

 To Prevent Cholera, Be Sure to Get Vaccinated

 There has been a risk of cholera spreading recently. There has been an epidemic in the central slum area of the French Concession. Fortunately, prevention measures were taken immediately to avoid further spread. A person from Shaoxing came to Shanghai on the 10th of this month. He was tired from the journey and became ill after being in bed for two days. He was sent to the isolation hospital due to the epidemic. Because he had stayed in a slum beforehand, two people living with him were also infected. In addition to vaccination, the following points should be noted for preventing cholera: food hygiene, especially drinking water, must be absolutely boiled. However, according to experience, vaccination is essential. The director of the Shanghai Pasteur Institute stated in his 1940 report that vaccination is effective and for how long. The conclusion is that after vaccination, the human body has the power to resist cholera. If the injection is sufficient, it will not be infected within four months. In the next few weeks, cholera will spread, so those who have not been vaccinated must be vaccinated immediately.

Italy only produces aircraft parts. Other European countries also have some production, but it is insignificant compared to the figures above.

### US Under Secretary of State Discusses Post-War Peace Efforts: Offensive Armaments Must Be Abolished, Economic Benefits Should Be Equal, and the United States Will Participate in Future Political Organizations

United Press, Washington, 23rd: Under Secretary of State Welles stated yesterday, "There can be no peace in Europe unless the Hitler government in Germany is completely eliminated."

Reuters, Washington, 23rd: Under Secretary of State Welles, speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Norwegian embassy yesterday, said that the governments of free nations and peace-loving people should now prepare for the happier days that will be found after the destruction of those who sacrifice humanity for selfish desires. The reason for the failure of the League of Nations initiated by former President Wilson was the blind selfishness of the United States and other parts of the world (referring to the US Senate's prevention of the United States from joining the League of Nations in 1920) and the use of the League of Nations by some powerful countries to pursue their political and commercial ambitions, as well as the indulgence of some powerful countries in the League of Nations Administrative Council, using it as a tool to maintain the status quo, rather than as a tool to adapt to the environment and seek peaceful and fair adjustments between countries as originally intended. When countries around the world once again undertake the great task of restoring law and order to a shattered world, they must find tools to accomplish such adjustments. Regardless of the specific structure, he believes two things must be done: first, the abolition of offensive armaments and the limitation and reduction of defensive military capabilities, accompanied by strict international supervision; second, the formulation of complete and adequate measures to ensure that the people of all countries enjoy equal economic benefits, so that a future effective and lasting peace can be established. If the people or governments of any country enjoy a monopoly on natural resources and do not allow others or other countries to share them, then the foundation for a world order based on justice and peace can never be achieved. World security represents the purpose that everyone seeks today, whether this security refers to freedom from air raids or mass destruction, or whether this security refers to each individual's right to live their life in peace and happiness. People all over the world certainly demand security and freedom from terror. This is the purpose of all of us today, which is to find a way to make it happen. He thinks that all people of goodwill will certainly be willing to make another effort to realize the great ideal of a group of nations, so as to obtain the freedom, happiness and security of all people.

### Two Famous American Technicians Hired to Come to China to Promote the Development of Modern Small Industries in the Free Areas of China

Havas News Agency (New York Air Mail): Two famous American mechanical engineers, namely Kangdong, the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Engineering, and Cooke, a technician from the Production Administration, have been hired by the American Committee for the Promotion of Chinese Industrial Cooperation to go to China to promote the development of modern small industries in the free areas of China. According to the mission of the committee, it is to find ways to make the methods used by modern American industry suitable for the industry of free China. Therefore, it is now looking for professionals in various industries to serve directly in the interior of China. These talents must not only receive theoretical training, but also be rich in practical experience. According to Kangdong, the Massachusetts Institute of Engineering has designated Chinese industrial production issues as a special research topic for graduates. At the same time, the Pennsylvania Institute of Technology is also studying this issue under the personal guidance of President Sackett. At Columbia University in New York, the Dean of the School of Mines, Litt, is also guiding the study of Chinese industrial production issues. The results of the research will be reported to the China Industrial Cooperative Association. The total number of industrial cooperatives established in various places in the free areas of China has reached 3,000. All equipment is very standard, mostly machines moved from the occupied areas or simple manual machines. Therefore, the future of the United States to assist China in revitalizing industry is very promising. In the past two months, a large number of talents and materials have arrived in China. The Gonghe Association has also drafted a detailed plan to build foundry, steelmaking furnace and coking furnace to refine tar. In addition, it will also manufacture cement, gypsum powder, ink, bleaching powder, manufacture leather, and refine iron ore. In addition, it is hoped that it can obtain spinning machines, steel, and equipment needed for machinery factories that China needs. Although the capital of the China Industrial Cooperative Association is only US$500,000, its production volume is increasing monthly.

### US Uses Civil Defense Forces to Protect Naval Institutions: Senate Votes to Pass Measures to Prevent Nazi Sabotage Conspiracies

Reuters, Washington, 23rd: The US Senate yesterday passed a measure to defend US naval institutions with civil defense forces by a vote of 41 to 14. Senator Walsh, chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, said that according to secret reports from the Navy, arson and other sabotage incidents have repeatedly occurred in naval institutions in the past twelve months. San Francisco is where the headquarters of the American Nazi Party is located. Naval authorities estimate that there are no less than four hundred Nazis on the West Coast. In his opinion, if a US battleship were to be bombed due to secret sabotage, it would be very detrimental to the country. Therefore, he advocated using civil defense forces to protect naval stations.

Reuters, Washington, 23rd: The US Senate yesterday unanimously passed a bill without debate, approving $545,000,000 for expenses to expand naval shipbuilding, ship repair, and gun emplacement facilities. The bill has now been sent to the White House.

United Press, Washington, 23rd: The House Naval Committee yesterday passed a bill requesting the Secretary of the Navy to extend the period of future naval recruitment in an emergency. An amendment was added to this bill to allow soldiers whose original recruitment period has expired and who re-enlist within 24 hours to receive double the reward. At the same time, a bill was also passed, ordering the Navy to use US$300 million to expand coastal facility plans.

### Severe Flooding in Central and Southern Japan Causes Unprecedented Damage

Taiwan Public News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: The water level of Lake Kasumigaura, six kilometers north of Tokyo, rose another four feet today. Therefore, the military authorities had to assist in the evacuation of residents in the Tsuchiura area. The Japanese Allied News Agency said that 1,200 citizens have voluntarily risen to defend against the floods, but 5,000 private houses in the city have been washed away. The City Council held an emergency meeting to discuss food supply issues and other necessary measures. All schools have been completely suspended. Tsuchiura also experienced the same flood in 1938, and residents evacuated under the same conditions. At the same time, central and southern Japan have also suffered the greatest losses in history due to the storm. Railway and highway traffic has been suspended in many places, and tens of thousands of private houses have been completely washed away. The Shimizu corner tunnel along the Tokaido line, between Hodogaya and Totsuka near Yokohama, has been interrupted due to a landslide. All vehicles have been forced to detour onto ground roads. Several low-lying areas in Tokyo have become swamps.

United Press, Tokyo, 23rd: Tokyo escaped the hurricane today. This morning, the hurricane swept across the mouth of Tokyo Bay and turned into the Pacific Ocean from Chiba and other places, but the rapid currents and heavy rain have flooded 76,000 houses in Tokyo. The water level of the Tamagawa River rose, so residents of Kawasaki City near it have left their homes to escape. The Meteorological Bureau announced that Tokyo received a total of 10 inches of rain in the 72 hours up to 6:00 p.m. yesterday, the second largest rainfall in 60 years. The largest rainfall was in June 1938, when it rained 11 inches.

### China's First Ambassador to Australia, Xu Mo, Issues a Statement, Saying that Sino-Australian Relations Are Becoming Closer

Chongqing: Xu Mo, the new Chinese Ambassador to Australia, issued a statement today stating that the relationship between China and Australia will become closer due to the current situation. Xu said, "I am very honored to be appointed as China's first ambassador to Australia. The relationship between China and Australia has always been cordial, and it is now becoming closer due to the situation in the Eastern Hemisphere.

### Chongqing Plans to Issue Grain Ration Certificates by Population: Already Printed and Will Be Distributed by the Police

Chongqing: The Dagong Bao reported yesterday that the government is now preparing to issue new grain ration certificates in Chongqing for the distribution of rice flour by population. These grain ration certificates have already been printed and will be distributed by the police. At the same time, Minister of Food Xu Kan reported that after the implementation of paying taxes with rice and grain, the food problem for the Chinese military and civilians next year can be solved. The government expects to obtain 50 million shi of grain by this method. Xu declared during Commemoration Week that the biggest obstacle to the government's implementation of its food program is the landlords. Landlords in Sichuan receive 60% to 73% of all grain produced, but they are still unwilling to transport it to the government. The official Central News Agency commented on Xu's speech, saying that Xu called for the Food Department's slogan of "solving tenants." The Minister of Food declared that the income of ordinary tenants is insufficient to maintain their livelihood, which greatly affects agricultural production. Xu also said, "The land policy of the Kuomintang is centered on 'those who cultivate the land own the land.' This is a prerequisite for increasing production, but it can only be completed gradually." Xu also reiterated Sun Yat-sen's legacy of increasing agricultural production by technical methods. He said that only by implementing Sun Yat-sen's legacy can China become a modern agricultural country from a primitive agricultural country. Xu also advocated that the government establish warehouses in various counties to store surplus grain for future use, and advocated banning winemaking to save grain. Xu also said that in addition to implementing the payment of money and grain with grain and rice in the second half of this year, the government has also decided to purchase grain on a large scale at officially determined prices. The Chongqing warehouse currently stores 280,000 shi of grain, so there is no shortage of grain. (United Press, 23rd)
