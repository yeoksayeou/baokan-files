Current Discussion Issues Can Be Divided into Three Main Areas

Washington, December 23 (Reuters) – According to general speculation, the issues currently being discussed by Roosevelt and Churchill can be divided into three main areas: 1. The issue of joint defense by Britain and the United States in the various centers threatened in the Far East, especially Singapore and the Philippines. 2. The issue of how to protect strategically important areas at risk of German invasion, referring to French African bases and the Central Atlantic. 3. The issue of establishing a general strategy and managing their resources and manpower, using them in the time and place most needed to achieve a common victory. Solving these issues is essential for cooperation among countries fighting against Hitlerism. Opinions on the first issue are divided into two camps. The first camp focuses on defending the Philippines, while the other camp emphasizes the defense of Singapore. Regarding the second issue mentioned above, some people believe that a new era of cooperation is about to unfold. The Vichy government believes that Germany has lost its chance of victory, and this feeling is growing. Therefore, Vichy is willing to make various concessions, even seeking help from the United States, in order to preserve its empire. The eagerness for this hope is increasing day by day. It is said that most Vichy figures hold this attitude, and even if Pétain does not, some of his most trusted advisors share the same sentiment. What can be said for certain at present is that at this stage and in the future evolution of events, the final outcome will depend on which side gains the upper hand in Vichy. Since Britain and the United States share the same goals, it is necessary to form a concrete agreement. This move is only to immediately implement agreements based on past cooperation. Britain and the United States attach great importance to this meeting. As a result of the meeting, Britain and the United States may form an agreement on the foundation that the future world should have.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, December 24 – White House Secretary Early told reporters yesterday that President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill's night meeting on Sunday lasted until 1:00 AM on Tuesday. Although officials did not reveal the content of the night meeting, rumors are rampant in Washington. According to well-informed sources, the topics discussed included: 1. Obtaining the full assistance of the Soviet Union in the Pacific; 2. Preparing for Britain and the United States to prevent the Axis powers from occupying French Africa; 3. Establishing a base on the coast of Ireland to combat German submarines in the Atlantic.

Selection of Naval Commanders in Two Oceans Allegedly Agreed Upon

Havas, Washington, December 23 – Political figures here recently stated that British Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt held a meeting at the White House at 5:00 PM today. The highest military commanders of Britain and the United States were present. This meeting was actually the first meeting of the recently established Allied Supreme Military Council. The official communique issued afterward is believed to cover the issue of unified military command, a matter that American newspapers and the public have unanimously deemed necessary. Britain and the United States have reached an agreement. As for the detailed arrangements for the unified command of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, they will not be released for the time being due to military secrets. However, important issues, such as how the US military will accept the command of the British General Headquarters and how the British military will accept the control of the US General Headquarters, have been agreed upon. Officials state that the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in the Pacific theater should be from the United States. General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the US Far East Command, is very knowledgeable about the strategic situation in the Far East, making him the most suitable candidate for commander-in-chief of the Allied forces. Based on his ability and talent, he has a strong reputation in the United States. His recent promotion to Army General has greatly attracted the attention of the American public. As for the Pacific naval battle, the commander-in-chief of the Allied fleet will also be Admiral Ernest King, Commander-in-Chief of the US Navy. In the Atlantic, the commander-in-chief of the Allied fleet will be a British admiral. Britain has two years of rich experience in fighting in the Atlantic and will certainly make great contributions to the common goal.

Havas, Washington, December 23 – The White House Presidential Office recently announced that the Allied Supreme Military Council met this afternoon. President Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Churchill, American Army and Navy leaders, Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins, and British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook attended, discussing combat plans and strategic methods.

Haitong News Agency, Buenos Aires, December 24 – According to reports from Washington, President Roosevelt yesterday invited British Prime Minister Churchill and his entourage to a military conference.

Focus on European Battlefield to Prevent New German Offensives

Havas, Washington, December 23 – The White House issued a statement this month stating that after the British-American meetings, the Allied nations will continue to hold joint conferences, with the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and the British Dominions all participating. Political figures here believe that British Prime Minister Churchill's stay in Washington will be lengthy. Moreover, the headquarters of Allied operations has clearly moved to Washington, which is also attracting attention from all parties. According to a certain observer, Britain and the United States will ask the Soviet Union to allow them to use Vladivostok as an air base for future attacks on Japan. This issue is likely to be the main topic of the next joint conference. As for the issues discussed by Roosevelt and Churchill, external speculation is rampant. It is understood that one of them is that Britain and the United States have drafted a "lightning counterattack" plan to counteract the military actions that Germany is about to launch. According to external rumors, Roosevelt and Churchill have obtained reliable information that Germany will soon take action. Therefore, some believe that the vision of these two democratic leaders is still focused on the European battlefield.

Havas, Washington, December 23 – After the first meeting between President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill yesterday, political figures here stated that the White House has now become the headquarters for the anti-Axis war. Congressional figures believe that this marks the beginning of new efforts and major decisions by the Allied nations. It is reported that the British Prime Minister arrived in Washington at 6:57 PM yesterday, and two hours later, he began talks with President Roosevelt. According to officials, the main issues discussed by both sides were how to coordinate the efforts of the various Allied nations, especially coordinating various matters related to promoting production and jointly utilizing resources. In addition, the following issues were also particularly emphasized by both sides: 1. How the Allied nations should jointly prevent Germany from taking new military actions in Europe; 2. How to closely cooperate with the Soviet Union on various battlefields; 3. How to prepare for and deter Germany's potential attacks on Turkey or its dispatch of troops through Spain to attack Gibraltar, in order to completely control the Mediterranean; 4. How to assist the Soviet Union so that it is capable of coping with new German offensives in the coming spring. According to political figures here, representatives from China, the Soviet Union, the Dutch East Indies, and the British Dominions will also participate in future meetings between British and American representatives. At that time, the possibility of discussing the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan may also be raised.

### German Foreign Minister Issues Statement Denies Peace Overtures; Will Launch Large-Scale War Next Year

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, December 24 – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, in an interview with Ortiz, the correspondent of the Spanish official news agency "EFE", declared: "Now is not the time for peace talks; now is the time for war, until Germany, Italy, and Japan are victorious. Millions of people who have joined the Tripartite Pact know that this is the only goal and are willing to sacrifice for it. The rumor spread by Moscow that Germany has issued peace overtures is 'nonsense'. The war against the Soviet Union must continue until the threat from the east is eliminated. This is the main task of the German army in 1942, which will be personally commanded by Hitler. The German army has now withdrawn from the protruding battle lines to spend the winter. It is ridiculous if the Soviet Union and Britain regard this as their victory. However, the German army will still proceed according to the original plan. The Soviet Union problem will be resolved by the German army next year. The purpose of the Tripartite Pact is to prevent the war from spreading and to prevent the United States from participating. The outbreak of the Pacific war should be the responsibility of Roosevelt. Japan has already gained superiority in the sea and air within three days, which cannot be compensated by Britain and the United States. The signatory countries of the Tripartite Pact are now cooperating closely, and we will stop fighting only after resolving all issues."

### Important Steps to Maintain People's Food Supply: Success in Suppressing Flour Prices

Flour milling industry guarantees implementation of new price limits, alleviating crowding for rice purchases. Restrictions on the manufacture and sale of bread, pastries, and cakes have been relaxed.

The reduction of flour prices by the authorities of the two concessions was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is generally believed that this is the most important relief step since the establishment of rice prices six weeks ago, as flour is one of the two main foods for the citizens. Recently, the price of flour has been from $1.40 to $1.50 per catty. Starting yesterday, it will be sold for 95 cents within the concessions.

Important Measure to Stabilize Prices

The Price Control Offices of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council state that although the price reduction is small, millions of citizens will benefit. The amount of flour used to make noodles in Shanghai each month is usually about 70,000 bags, which shows the importance of noodles in the people's food supply. The municipal authorities, recognizing this, first focused on opening flour warehouses, which was realized with the cooperation of the Japanese authorities, and then reduced the price of flour by about six cents per catty.

Flour Milling Association Guarantees Cooperation

The success of the bureau in this regard was also due to the guaranteed cooperation of the Flour Milling Association. The association has 452 members, and its representatives have agreed to the Price Control Office to sell noodles at the limited price of 95 cents per catty and will never hinder the implementation of the limited price by strikes or other disturbances. It is heard that the Flour Milling Association has also agreed to fully produce noodles within the next six months. As an indirect result of this development, the number of citizens competing for purchases in front of rice shops will naturally decrease, as the general public can already buy noodles to fill their stomachs.

Relaxation of Bread Restrictions

The Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to revise the restrictions on the manufacture and sale of bread as follows, starting from the 25th of this month:

Bread

All shops, cafes, other places, and all licensed bakeries shall comply with the types of bread and their prices approved by Bulletin No. 5660.

Variety

Bread, bread rolls, and biscuits, provided that unbleached wheat flour or rice flour is not used, the above items may be manufactured and sold in the Public Concession.

Biscuits

The measures restricting the manufacture of soda crackers and plain dry biscuits such as army biscuits and dog biscuits have now been lifted. The manufacture and sale of sweet biscuits and fancy biscuits must be approved by the Bureau before they can be processed.

Candy

If unbleached wheat flour or rice flour is not used, the various restrictions on the manufacture and sale of candy previously stipulated have now been lifted.

The above items apply to manufacturers located in the Public Concession and the Extra-Settlement Roads West area who obtain flour supplies with the assistance of the Bureau.

The French Concession also decided yesterday that pastries made without wheat flour or rice flour may be manufactured and sold in the French Concession during Christmas and New Year's Day.

Crowding for Rice Purchases Remains Unabated

Taikoo, Xin Yuan, and Mao Tai warehouses have abundant rice stocks, totaling more than 200,000 bags. Therefore, the rice allocated to various rice shops, schools, factories, and hospitals yesterday was still collected from these three warehouses. It is heard that this foreign rice is a special grade of small rice from Yangon, and the quality of the rice is very good. However, the amount applied for by each rice shop is not large, so retail sales have not been smooth. The crowds asking to buy rice are still extremely crowded. According to the regulations of the Rice Grain Office, each rice shop must first verify that it is indeed white rice and that there is no mold, damage, or broken rice before releasing the goods. If the above situation is discovered after the rice leaves the warehouse, the rice merchant shall be responsible for it.

Designated Rice Warehouses in Batches

The Shanghai Municipal Council Rice Management Committee has negotiated with rice merchants to determine that all rice shops that registered eight days later to receive and sell foreign rice in stock can collect goods from the Xin Yuan warehouse after paying. Those who registered in the second batch can collect goods from the Mao Tai warehouse. Those who registered in the third batch have started to pay the fee yesterday, but the warehouse for delivery is yet to be assigned. As each warehouse will be closed for two days of holiday starting today as usual, the delivery of goods to each rice shop may be temporarily suspended today. However, yesterday, each rice shop released a large amount of goods under the supervision of the authorities to meet sales demand in the next two days.

Payment Balance to be Returned Next Week

The Xiang Mao Foreign Firm has now arranged to settle the balances for the sale of foreign rice in stock before the 8th of this month for a total of 418 rice shops, amounting to 556,000 yuan in national currency. The Xiang Mao Foreign Firm has now settled separately and may return the full amount next week. At that time, each rice shop can hold the weighing slips issued previously, and the firm can pay on the basis of the slips. As for the remaining rice shops, they can directly register with the industry association. The association will report to the Xiang Mao Foreign Firm on its behalf after receiving the notification. As for the date of return of the rice purchase balance after the 8th, the date has not yet been determined.

Huxi Orders Rice in Preparation for Sale at Low Prices

At the beginning of this month, the Huxi Special Police Department negotiated with the Shanghai Municipal Council Rice Management Committee to order a large quantity of foreign rice. Sales began on the 3rd of this month and were completed on the 7th of this month. It is now learned that they are still actively clearing rice sources and have allocated funds to order a large quantity of national rice, which will be shipped to Shanghai. In the future, the department will hand it over to various rice shops for door-to-door sales. It is also learned that the military ticket rice issued by the Japanese side will also be delivered to various sales rice shops in Huxi for retail sales within days.

### Material Declaration Deadline Today

The deadline for the declaration of important materials in the French Concession, which was originally scheduled to end yesterday, has been extended to today. Those who have important materials stored in the French Concession must rush to the Food and Price Management Committee of the French Municipal Council to handle the declaration before 5 p.m. today. At the same time, the declaration of important materials in the Public Concession will also end tonight. The declaration in the French Concession began on Monday of this week at No. 2 Fulili Road. Hundreds of Chinese and foreign people went to register. Those who registered at the temporary office of the Japanese Consulate in the Zhengjin Bank have also accelerated their progress as the deadline is approaching. The number of people who registered yesterday was quite crowded, mostly Chinese, with only a few foreigners. In addition, there is a slight difference in the registration time between the two places. The temporary office of the Japanese Consulate is from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., while the French Concession Price Management Office is from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.

### Power Company Reduces Coal Consumption by 7,000 Tons Per Month

Harkins, President of the Power Company, stated that the latest electricity reduction measures announced by the Shanghai Municipal Council will result in a monthly coal saving of approximately 7,000 tons. The company used a total of 41,000 tons of coal in November. Under the new system, the monthly coal consumption is expected to be no more than 34,000 tons, including the supply of 3,500 tons of electricity to the French Concession to supplement the required coal. Industrial electricity users will reduce their usual electricity consumption to 45%. Some factories will certainly be hit hard, but on average, the city's industry will not suffer unreasonable damage as a result. At present, the Power Company's coal reserves are sufficient to meet the power generation needs under the new measures, and since the relevant authorities have promised to supply coal, there is no fear of another major reduction in the city's current and power in the short term.

### Floating Sculpture of Christmas Eve on an Isolated Island

— Zhang Ge

Christmas Eve on the Streets

Traveling east from Jing'an Temple by tram, the number of passengers was less than a third of those traveling west. Although the tram wasn't crowded, judging from the silent and unhappy faces of everyone, they all seemed to feel upset inside, and one could hardly find any Christmas spirit this evening. West of Carter Road, there were no Christmas decorations along the tram route either. In previous years, on this day, the Christmas tree on the plaza of the American Club was adorned with silver ribbons and embedded with colorful small electric lights, shining brightly. Round wreaths made of colored ribbons hung on doors and windows, and tipsy sailors strolled in and out. Not far away, the Shanghai Yacht Club also had a huge conical Christmas tree, with clusters of colored electric bulbs, looking like fruits hanging heavily on branches. American gentlemen, abandoning their usual seriousness, would often attend costume parties.

Both of these places were quiet this year. The Christmas tree in front of the newly established Jewish Community Center near the American Club became the only decoration. East of the Paramount Ballroom, it was relatively lively. Dance halls and bars, celebrating this festive season, had all made some arrangements to attract guests. Near the New World, because it was a concentration area for dance venues, the Christmas Eve atmosphere started to become more intense. Occasionally, young gentlemen were seen walking by, arm in arm with glamorous girls dressed in colorful attire, undoubtedly couples preparing to enjoy themselves this evening. The windows of the four major department stores had Christmas decorations, but they were not as beautiful as in the past with their dazzling lights and colors, barely one-tenth as attractive. The Santa Claus standing in the window, with his white beard and red clothes, looked the same as before, but his smile appeared very unnatural, and his posture was somewhat tired. There were no cars speeding past with ladies, and occasionally there were a few pedestrians carrying Christmas gifts wrapped in flowered paper. Their demeanor seemed to have added a lot of luster, enough to make other pedestrians look dull in comparison.

Christmas Eve Dance Halls

Christmas Eve is the peak season for dance halls, making it the most profitable day of the year. Therefore, each establishment schemed and competed to show off novelties to their guests. The tickets for the first-class dance halls on Christmas Eve ranged from ten to eleven yuan, and the so-called Christmas dinner cost as much as forty or fifty yuan per person. The various levels of dance halls that didn't sell tickets instead increased the tea charges to supplement their income. The price of a cup of plain tea was outrageously high. Before eight o'clock, the tea dances at the Great China Theatre were extremely crowded. Some of the dancers were "old hands" who thought, "Why not have fun in the same way? Tea dances are cheap, and they can go home to celebrate with their families at dinner time, which is truly suitable for both inside and outside." Some came to report to familiar dance hostesses, indicating that they would not "scalp" them for the evening dance. Still others were stall-setters. Listening to the music at Tang Qiaosi's evening dance would require a twelve-yuan ticket, but now they could listen for free, and they were all blessed with unique voices, sweet and rhythmic, making it well worth listening to. After eight o'clock, a tour of the dance halls in the central district revealed that they were about 70-80% full. Only a few people were seen wearing paper hats on their heads, probably because dressing up for dancing no longer interested the young masters and gentlemen in this day and age. In the past, upper-middle dance halls were filled with balloons today, preparing to release them at exactly twelve o'clock when the Christmas song was played, allowing the reveling men and women to scramble and grab them in a frenzy. This was an excellent gimmick, but this year it was nowhere to be seen. Perhaps they thought that rubber balloons were too expensive to play with. The attire of the red dance hostesses had been completely renewed, with white and pink dominating, plus heavy makeup, looking like a gathering of new brides. Some dance hostesses remained unchanged, sitting quietly on the sidelines. They seemed to have no high expectations for Christmas Eve. Very few people were dancing, and the attire of the musicians was not as splendid as in previous years. All of this was partly reality and partly psychological. Many people said that this year's Christmas Eve was the most miserable night since the dance halls existed, and I felt the same way. If it weren't for these few young masters and gentlemen going to join in the revelry, it would look just like a cold and deserted ordinary Monday night.

Originally, all the dance halls had planned to stay open all night on Christmas Eve, but due to the temporary measures of the authorities in both concessions, they had to obey orders to close at two o'clock after midnight. This was like pouring cold water on those who loved to play late. It was impossible to stay up all night, so those who were not yet satisfied accompanied their beautiful companions to the dance halls in the western district. Hard times couldn't stop them, and that's how this miserable Christmas Eve passed.

### The Truth About the Tragic Fire at the Ping'an Hotel: Those in Distress Raise Their Heads, Awaiting Rescue

To the Gentlemen and Ladies of All Circles in Shanghai: As we are in extraordinary times, the cost of living is rising daily. Fellow sufferers, leaving their hometowns and living in the Ping'an Hotel on Zhubao Road in Shanghai, run small businesses, hoping to earn a meager profit to support their families. Unexpectedly, disaster struck suddenly around 1 a.m. on November 29, when a fire broke out. The source of the disaster was the Jintai Paper Store, which was storing fuel. The fire quickly spread, first engulfing the neighboring Ping'an Hotel. When the fire first broke out, the occupants of the hotel were awakened from their dreams and hurriedly packed their belongings, fleeing in panic. Those living on the third floor and first floor all carried their suitcases downstairs. However, the hotel not only refused to open the doors to let the guests escape, but instead locked the iron doors, ordering the travelers to return to their rooms to sleep. It was discovered that the hotel was originally equipped with fire hoses and fire extinguishers, but although the hoses were attached, they were never used. When questioned, the tea servers replied that the boss said it would cost fifty taels of silver to turn them on. This continued for two or three hours, causing the fire to spread. Although the travelers repeatedly begged to open the doors, they were never allowed to. When the fire reached the third floor, the hotel suddenly turned off all the lights and selfishly opened the doors to escape. In the midst of panic and confusion, the thousand-plus travelers were unable to discern anything, and they fled east and west in the dark, rushing up and down, only seeking to escape with their lives. Immediately, order broke down, resulting in some being trampled to death, some being burned and injured to death, and some being unable to escape and being buried in the flames. The fire spread very quickly, and the staircases were broken. If they had not broken through the walls to escape, they would have all perished together. The various tragic scenes are difficult to describe. All the travelers suffered losses. The origin of the losses and casualties was the Jintai Paper Store, but the Ping'an Hotel should bear a major responsibility. If Jintai had not stockpiled dangerous goods, this unprecedented disaster would not have occurred. If the Ping'an Hotel had opened the iron doors and emergency exits early and let the guests escape, it would not have caused such a catastrophe. The fellow sufferers have suffered this disaster, and their clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all gone. At this time of severe winter, it is difficult to survive. It was assumed that Ping'an Jintai would eventually have a good solution, but to this day, they still turn a blind eye and heartlessly leave the victims wandering in the streets, exposed to the wind and dew, becoming beggars and filling ditches. This is intolerable by the laws of heaven, humanity, and reason. How can a human being act in such a way? Although the Hubei Fellow Travelers Association has enthusiastically provided relief, it seems like a drop in the bucket and is not enough to solve the problem. Thinking about it in the quiet of the night, it is unbearable. We dare to ask all circles to uphold justice and render a fair judgment to comfort the spirits and save the survivors. This will not only uphold the law and value humanity, but also serve as a warning to profiteering merchants who hoard goods. What is described above cannot be kept silent. We hereby declare it to the press, hoping for your kind consideration and assistance so that we can alleviate our difficulties. We are most grateful. Signed by Tang Zequan and others, representatives of the victims of the Ping'an Hotel fire in Shanghai.

### Letter

To the Editor: I have read a report in the newspaper about the export of prayer beads with inflated freight charges. Some of the details are inaccurate. I am writing to you to provide the true situation. After investigation, it was found that Gu Yourun, a customs declaration [blank] employee, inflated the freight charges and collected 600 yuan in water freight fees from the Nanjing Prayer Bead Company. According to representatives from the Nanjing Prayer Bead Company, the money was received and spent by Gu Yourun personally. In addition, a 40% discount on water freight fees was already recorded in the Nanjing company's books and has nothing to do with Mr. Li Weixin of the company. Moreover, the company has accounts to check. In order to clarify the facts, I hope your newspaper will make corrections. This is for your convenience. Sincerely, Hengmao Foreign Company, December 24.

### National Rice Peddlers Decorate Everywhere, Foreign Rice Trading Still Low

Yesterday's national rice supply was similar to before, still more than 300 stones, and peddlers were decorating everywhere. Although the total number is difficult to count, it is estimated to be not small, so the price has been falling day by day. Street peddlers are shouting prices of only 22 yuan per dou, which makes people feel stable and take a wait-and-see attitude. Transactions are extremely quiet. Moreover, today is a Christmas holiday, so merchants are even more eager to sell. They are all competing to sell, but the number of buyers is limited, and the market is also more uneven. As for the Bo rice, it initially opened at 242 to 1 yuan and 240 yuan. Later, it decreased level by level, dropping to 235 yuan and 230 yuan in the middle. In the end, it was only 225 yuan, a sharp drop of more than ten yuan compared to the previous market. In addition, early rice was sold for 236 yuan. There were also two newly arrived dujian trucks, which were more sought after because they had been out of stock for a long time. The original package opened at 227 yuan and 225 yuan. Foreign rice sales are still low. It is expected that after the authorities have implemented proper measures, normal and free business can be resumed. The recent arrival of 18,000 bags of small ground rice is said to be being unloaded, and it is also rumored that 60,000 bags of the 2 million dan of Wujian are already en route. Furthermore, the purchase of Vietnamese rice is also underway. It is also reported that the two associations are strengthening their organization and will cooperate with the Public Works Department. Because there is more national rice in both retail and wholesale, small ground foreign rice has officially fallen to 125 yuan, with 200 bags being traded.

### Oil, Beans, Corn, Downstream

Trading of miscellaneous grains was still sparse yesterday. The market was still weak and lackluster. Oil, beans, and corn all saw a continued downward trend. It is estimated that 20 barrels of idle Dalian bean oil were sold for 368.5 yuan, 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were sold for 370 yuan, 300 dan of Dayou Factory vegetable oil were sold for 253 yuan to 249 yuan, 100 bags of Tianjin Xinjin were sold for 90 yuan, 50 bags of Fork Qing beans were sold for 80.05 yuan, 50 bags of Chongming sand peas were sold for 89 yuan, and 30 se of sand silkworms were sold for 58 yuan. More than ten bags of Pudong secondary du beans were sold for 85 yuan, and more than 200 bags of Saigon new Xiang rice were sold for 45 yuan to 44.3 yuan.

The Rice, Wheat, Miscellaneous Grains, and Oil Cake Association was established yesterday. In addition to appointing people in charge, it will also assist in handling civil food.

### Recognizing that the Gold Price is Low, the Market Turns Sharply

The cash black market first fell and then suddenly rose, and the price has returned outside the 9,000 yuan mark. This is because the recent sharp drop has been too great, approaching the rumored limit price. The jewelry industry and cash shops vigorously advanced, and a certain bank purchased at the rear, causing the timid to be reassured, and the market turned stable. From an initial 8,800 yuan, there was supply without demand. Soon after, it continued to decline, and a certain bank sold dozens of taels, and the price continued to fall to 8,750 yuan and 8,700 yuan. It was heard that the lowest price was 8,500 yuan. Jewelry shops and two cash shops came to collect and absorb at around 9,000 yuan. A certain bank then entered again, and it gradually rose to 9,400 yuan. The Tianjin gang vigorously sold about 100 taels, retreating to 9,100 yuan. However, the market had turned firm, and the cash shops and a certain bank continued to collect and absorb, and then went up to the last 9,500 yuan. The price rose by 550 yuan compared to the previous day, with a high and low of 800 yuan on the day. About 400-500 taels were traded. In the end, the price rose to 9,700 yuan. The exchange price for gold jewelry from pawnshops and peers was raised by 50 yuan, totaling 1,050 yuan. At 2 p.m., it was raised by another 50 yuan to 1,100 yuan (receipt reduced by 200 yuan). The exchange rate for silver was still 16 yuan, and the black market fell to 9 yuan.

The discount rate for remittance notes has fallen to 2.5 to 3 yuan per thousand, or even to a flat rate. The Money Trade Association's interbank rate is still 6 points.

Today and tomorrow are Christmas holidays, and the black market may be difficult to trade.

### Bank Clearing House Collects

Interbank Bills

The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Clearing Committee (i.e., the Bank Bill Exchange) temporarily suspended the collection of foreign bank bills from the 8th of this month. In order to facilitate the collection of bills by the industry, the committee yesterday sent a circular to all banks, stating that from the 26th (tomorrow), it will first resume the collection of payment bills from the committee's correspondent banks (i.e., a portion of foreign bank bills) other than the committee's contracted correspondent banks. The list of the committee's correspondent banks and the time for collecting various bills are recorded below:

From December 26th, all banks that receive payment bills from these two houses and entrust the committee to collect them should handle them in the same way as other member money houses.

### US Dollar Falls Frequently, Once Breaking the 15 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's US dollar market became increasingly unsustainable, once falling to 14.5 yuan. The final price was [blank]-5.23 yuan, a considerable drop compared to the previous day. The buying price for Hong Kong dollars was 2 yuan, the selling price was [blank]3.4 yuan, and military coupons were 3.89 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn Slump Progress: Yarn Futures to be Resolved

The current yarn situation has seen continuous sharp declines, and the momentum has stabilized somewhat. However, Japanese yarn prices are relatively high, and transactions have not progressed, mainly due to the slump in gold prices, causing public anxiety. The spot price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 3,450 yuan, and the factory price is 21,400 yuan. The price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 2,130 yuan, 20-count Celestial Maiden is 2,300 yuan, 20-count Moon Lute is 1,820 yuan, and 18-count Weaver Girl is 1,810 yuan, all of which are spot prices on the floor. The initial price of 20-count Double Horse factory orders was 1,550 yuan, rising to 1,580 yuan, but the transaction volume was not as high as the previous day. The spot price of Double Horse on the floor is 1,800 yuan, and some people want to buy it.

The Cotton Industry Exchange, brokers, and other parties convened a meeting to discuss the standard for 20-count Blue Phoenix 12-pound colored ball yarn cloth. After discussion, it was generally decided to adopt a settlement method, based on the closing price on the 8th. The price of yarn fell by 295 yuan, and the price of cotton cloth fell by 10 yuan per bolt, to settle this transaction clearly. Future resumption of business will be decided later.

### Light Flannel Awaiting a Good Price

Lightweight, fine-quality flannel has recently been quite popular. According to the market, goods are extremely scarce, and factory production is minimal. Supplies from Eastern and Western countries have been cut off, so even existing inventory is regarded as precious. If buyers request samples, the prices quoted are all high, with the intention of waiting until next spring to sell at a good price.

### Consolidating Client Margin: Public Bonds Temporarily Suspended Yesterday

The public bond market was temporarily suspended yesterday at the request of brokers due to the sharp decline in the bond market, which was causing problems with client margins. The usual limit is only 4 points, but after two days of trading, the price has fallen sharply, nearly 20 yuan for some, and no less than 12 or 13 yuan for others, effectively meaning there were many 49-point limits, which greatly unsettled people. However, off-market trading continued to decline yesterday. Although the volume of transactions was not large, the price continued to fall slightly by one or two yuan. Class A bonds were initially traded at 57 yuan, and Class C bonds were initially traded at 54.34 yuan, followed by 54 yuan. Ultimately, there were sellers but no buyers. In the current situation, it is extremely easy to buy, but very difficult to sell. Today is a bank holiday and there is no market.

Chinese stock trading still had more sellers than buyers, and no prices were reported. Outside of the Public Association of Brokers, Jardine Matheson shares were at 60 to 61 yuan, Ewo Cotton Mill shares had fallen to 28 to 245 yuan, Land Investment at 223 yuan, Shanghai Steel at 178 yuan, Shanghai Land at 22 yuan with sellers, China Cotton at 8.75 yuan, and paper and wool stocks were all at 6.5 yuan, it is said.

### Longan Sold Out

Due to the complete disruption of the supply of dried longan fruit, the numbered lots of goods have been released one after another. It is reported that they have all been sold out. The remaining stock on the market is all in the hands of merchants, so the selling price has been raised, and it will be difficult to lower it for a while.

### Lily Flower Inventory Low

Due to a decrease in sales of lily flowers, ordinary dealers may enter the 100-yuan mark, but at the same time, the supply is also scarce, and goods seized in sealed banks and warehouses are difficult to release for the time being. Market inventories are gradually becoming thin, so the listed price has tightened, and yesterday it was already reported that it had risen.

### Cigarette Consumption Undiminished

Cigarette consumption remains undiminished. Due to the factories having no goods to distribute, the spot goods are scarce, and fellow traders are mutually raising prices, so the market is gradually increasing. British American Tobacco is 3,810 yuan, Old Knife Brand is 2,600 yuan, Pin Hai Brand is 3,010 yuan, Five Hua Brand is 2,610 yuan, and Little Fairy is 1,700 yuan (price per 50,000 cigarettes), all higher than before.

Match and soap prices are still stable, as the authorities have imposed strict restrictions, so prices are difficult to change. Beautiful Brand matches are 1,460 yuan, Phoenix Brand are 1,450 yuan, Rose Brand are 1,450 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao soap is 51.5 yuan, Bai Xiang Mao soap is 65 yuan. Candle prices have fallen the most sharply, with Sailboat Brand at 39 yuan per box.

### Hardware Market With No Sales

The hardware market has remained quiet for days. Sales of hardware and iron materials needed for construction in the city have completely ceased. Factories are also automatically suspending or reducing production due to the impact of the continued shortage of raw materials. In addition, general retail buyers and users are temporarily reducing purchases because they feel that it is not easy to transfer goods. As a result, although prices are high, there are actually no sales.

### Miscellaneous Poems on People's Livelihood and Commerce

— Ji Ying

Everyone says rice is like pearls, there is rice but no coal briquettes. Cars have no gasoline. Diplomacy and doctors, public buses suddenly change three times a day. Dragons snatch to cook rice, how can it be hot? If there is organic matter, it cannot be moved. Cars can run, and those who drive cars rub shoulders. Three liters cost four yuan and a few cents, and forty gold is thrown away. Walking slowly is like being a soldier, the most difficult thing to do. Don't complain about the difficulty of walking, still saying that the price has not risen. Carrying half a load is not yet enough, perhaps there will be more consideration for robbers and kidnappers, who must race to be first.

Spring and Autumn

### This Year's Christmas

— Zhihua

The weather is humid, sultry, and warm again, simply not like winter. If the calendar wasn't torn off page by page by hand, one would think that the annual arrival of Jesus's birthday was an illusion.

In recent years, Christmas in Shanghai has been a carnival. Shanghai people, living in a perpetual Lantern Festival, hope for an excuse to indulge in entertainment, just to add some decoration. It is only natural that this religious holiday has become a carnival for non-Christians as well.

However, this year's Christmas is different from the past. The window decorations on Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Avenue Joffre are far from the scenes of the past. Santa Claus figures are scattered and countable. An endless snow scene is just a few cotton wads stuck to the glass windows, just to mark the occasion, and these may have been arranged a month ago.

Advertisements for Christmas dinners at forty yuan per person are posted in the newspapers. In the past, the first thought that would arise would be "the rich reek of wine and meat," but now, it makes one wonder how many people still have this kind of refined pleasure.

In the evening, the "Open All Night" dance hall advertisements may still be hanging high, but what about the scene of bustling traffic? Some dance halls are already inviting dancers to "walk instead of drive" and seek entertainment nearby.

So, what about Santa Claus's sleigh this year? Maybe he can only "walk instead of drive" too, and what he carries can only be bags of coal and white rice. ——Let's hope he carries these two daily necessities, so that the white cloth bags placed at the corners of the children's beds don't have to "queue up" in front of the rice shop the next day.

### Christmas Tree Market

— Meng

Before Christmas, as usual, all kinds of seasonal goods appear on the streets one after another. The most prominent is arguably the Christmas tree? In the past, as far as we know, the places where Christmas trees were concentrated were Jing'an Temple and Avenue Joffre. Because during the Christmas season, foreign families all plant a Christmas tree, and general stores selling Christmas gifts also place a Christmas tree in the window as an advertisement to attract customers, so the sales of Christmas trees are also quite good.

This time, although some stores still have Christmas decorations, generally speaking, it is far less lively than in previous years. This is something anyone can see. The main reason, of course, is that the number of foreigners has decreased, and the Christmas tree market inevitably sees the same decline. The day before yesterday, the author went to Avenue Joffre for a patrol. In the past, the corner of Route Mgr. Froc was a concentrated place for Christmas trees. This year, it has disappeared, with only a few flower shops putting up a few. In the shop windows, Christmas trees are rarely seen.

However, when walking in front of Jing'an Temple, the Christmas tree market appeared as usual before Christmas. The so-called Christmas trees are either pine or cypress, because in the cold winter season, only pine and cypress remain green and do not wither. Some are dug up with their roots, and some are just branches sawed off large trees, with four wooden supports propping them up on the ground, lined up along the road. Otherwise, this Christmas tree market is interfering with the vendors of the Buddha's Birthday festival, and must be moved to Route Hodebert, Route Haig, etc. This time, it is right in front of Jing'an Temple, and the number is much smaller than last year.

These Christmas trees are transported from the flower and tree shops in the four suburbs of Shanghai. In recent years, following the high prices of everything, Christmas trees have also risen in price. Taller ones cost tens of yuan per tree. Each flower and tree shop sends four or five workers to sit on the stone steps of the sluice gate and deal with customers. Otherwise, these few days would be the peak sales season for Christmas trees, but this year the situation is different. The workers watching the trees are all sitting and chatting, and rarely do people come up to choose and buy, and business is much quieter.

Several flower and tree shops, in addition to Christmas trees, have also brought in many ivy geraniums, plum blossoms, and other fresh flower potted plants. Because Westerners at Christmas need to decorate the house, and potted plants seem to be indispensable decorations. This year's Christmas, in front of Jing'an Temple, fresh flower potted plants are still on display, but more people are looking than buying.

### A Downer

— Tutu

Although we are in difficult times, Christmas is still Christmas. For the sake of business, the dance halls still celebrate it in the same way, announcing in the newspapers that they will be open all night on Christmas Eve to welcome dancers to participate in the carnival. Unexpectedly, the authorities of the two concessions suddenly announced that all public entertainment venues will only be open until 2:00 AM on yesterday and today, as well as on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, and will not be allowed to extend until 4:00 AM. In this way, it is impossible to stay open all night, and even the places that are usually open all night have suffered the misfortune of being caught in the crossfire and have to close early. This is really a downer, making the already sad Christmas even more bleak!

A Christmas dinner at fifty yuan per person, and a twelve yuan entrance fee per person, in fact, cannot be said to be too expensive when calculated according to the proportion of rising prices. Besides, the people of Shanghai have a great spirit of joining in the fun, and aren't they all packed to the rafters? Those who are usually busy raising food and clothing and are not qualified to seek pleasure are happy to sit at home behind closed doors and listen to the "Camel's Bells" in the air, and Zhong Jun spent Christmas Eve. If someone was tight on money yesterday, but his heart was itching, and he poured out his money to join in the fun, the joy of laughter would disappear in an instant, and the whip of life would follow closely behind. If he encountered some small trouble on the way home at midnight, that would be even more of a downer.

In the face of such a downer situation, the red-clothed, white-bearded Santa Claus will not be seen as an angel of happiness as in previous years, but will be so angry that his white beard will stand on end.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Fifteen, Dad, let's go busking!

"Now, sing another section, and I'll definitely pay double!" The chubby boy pointed at Mei Bao and said.

"Come and sit over here, the table is very empty!" The man called Little Li said in a drunken voice, pulling out the chair next to him.

Mr. Han knew the situation wasn't good, so he rushed forward and smiled at them, saying in very poor Shanghai dialect:

"Gentlemen, what opera would you like to hear?" He handed a booklet of opera excerpts to the table.

"No, Charlie, I'll pay twenty yuan to take her back to the hotel room and sing slowly!" Little Li staggered out of his seat, his right hand in his pocket, pretending to be looking for money.

Mei Zi didn't have time to step back, but at the same time, she put on a very dignified expression and said:

"Sorry, we can only sing opera, we can't go to the hotel room with guests."

Mr. Han was very astute, and knew that if they lingered any longer, things would definitely get out of hand, so he immediately winked at Mei Bao and his own daughter, and hurriedly helped Begonia up, and everyone prepared to leave these two drunks.

"Don't put on airs! We have plenty of money. If twenty yuan isn't enough, thirty yuan is no problem, right?" The chubby boy shouted in a raised voice.

Begonia's face was already turning blue with anger.

"Wait a minute,...forty yuan,...don't go!...forty yuan...!" Little Li, who was even more drunk than the chubby boy, actually staggered after them.

"Bullshit! What do you take my daughter for?" Begonia really couldn't bear it anymore, and suddenly turned around and shouted angrily.

Little Li was already no more than two or three steps away from them.

"Dad, let's go back! Don't argue with drunk people!" Mei Bao, fearing that her father would suffer, hurriedly pulled on his arm and urged him to leave; the Han family girl was also helping to persuade him gently.

"...Don't go!...I'll pay...five...fifty yuan...," the man called Little Li was already very drunk and didn't hear Begonia's words. (289)

### Searching for "Santa Claus"

— Xiaotian

Christmas, Santa Claus always carries a bag of toys, paper hats, jazz music, champagne... to distribute to the upper classes!

People welcome the arrival of Santa Claus because of his kindness; perhaps it is because he indulges our sins, smoking, drinking, dancing wildly, all night..., all the commandments of sin are lifted on Christmas. However, he only favors the children of God, not the outcasts of society.

The poor boys who don't even know how to read don't know—can't go to see the movies that are open for Christmas, or receive the gifts given by Santa Claus. They just shiver in the dim corners of the streets, wistfully watching the wisps of smoke rising from the chimneys of other people's houses. Waiting for the kind Santa Claus to descend from the sky into the chimney, so that they can beg for something to fill their stomachs.

Where is Santa Claus?

Santa Claus is in the glass window of the chocolate shop, in the flower shop, hanging behind the car, on the stage of the dance hall...!

Now, Santa Claus is circling in the sky above Shanghai, observing, and slipping away.

Flour is not allowed to be used to make Santa Claus, private cars are prohibited from driving, dance halls are not allowed to stay open all night during the holidays...

Let's search the whole world, where is Santa Claus?

Santa Claus is on the bell tower of the church in Switzerland, gazing at the fires in the distance and wandering!

### Winter Night Jottings

— Wuwei

Winter Night is the night before the winter solstice in foreign countries. I was neither invited by a friend to eat a winter solstice dinner at fifty yuan per person, nor could I go to a "high-end music hall to play all night"—which in fact has turned into half the night—so I curled up in my small room, smoked, drank tea, paced back and forth to pass the time, and wrote a few jottings to commemorate the "Merry Christmas" of 1941.

Although not buying Christmas gifts, I went to see them anyway. This is also a way to spend the festival and pass the time. I strolled to a certain large store where I bought family bread the other day, and upon entering, I saw that the crowded situation was very different from the past. Western men and women, and fashionable young men and old women, came and went, and their expressions were not tense. The gift packages they carried were not heavy and about to fall, so I knew that the market was not good, and this affected everyone's pockets at this time.

Fruits on the market have long become treasures. Ordinary salaried people have sighed that they can hardly taste them a few times a year. Flower baskets of fruits, filled with Flag bananas, sweet apples, or California "Sun-Kissed" oranges, are not small in size, and the fruits are especially large. It is like a small kiosk crammed with more than a dozen obese women. If one person moves, the whole situation will be uneasy. The marked price is more than sixty yuan, more than eighty yuan to one hundred and five yuan...and so on. If you add two bottles of Samsung Axe Brand brandy, then one thousand yuan can only buy two gifts, which is not even considered extravagant.

The Public Works Department stipulates that biscuits and pastries can only be sold on Sundays and public holidays. At present, the biscuit glass cabinets of each food store are "penniless", with no biscuits available. Today, Christmas is celebrated. In addition to the holiday, you can also buy biscuits. From December 25 to January 5, each person has the opportunity to buy biscuits three times—a total of three pounds. According to the price of the most widely sold biscuits, each pound is about three yuan and eight angles to four yuan. Buying three pounds of biscuits will cost twelve yuan. When rice is cheap, that is the price of one picul of white glutinous rice? That is more than enough for the monthly food of a family of six. Biscuits are a small thing, but "how can they be ignored"!

The English Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury used a large-sized headline to announce that the price of noodles had been cut. It stated that the price of noodles was about one yuan and four angles to one yuan and five angles per catty, but it has been approved by the Public Works Bureau's Price Control Committee to be nine angles and five cents per catty. This is good news for Christmas Eve, more than a full-page film advertisement or a red dance star's "waiting for instructions" announcement, which is full of "temptation". However, there are many gentlemen in Shanghai who "don't ask about the price of noodles, but only seek news from the dance hall". Although this news is published in the most obvious position, it may not be noticed by this class of people.

According to legend, on the eve of the winter solstice, Santa Claus comes down from the chimney and fills the children's stockings with toys and leaves. The next morning, the children smiled and rejoiced, thinking that this St. Nicholas could really come from the North Pole in a deer-drawn carriage. According to Western books, this legend started because the New Year is approaching, and residents all sweep the chimney to prepare for welcoming the good luck of the New Year. Now, coal in Shanghai is as expensive as gold, and only one or two out of a hundred families burn coal. As for coal briquette stoves, they don't use chimneys at all. In theory, the arrival of good luck in every household should be unhindered, so there is no need to ask for help from chimney sweeping. I would like to congratulate all readers, anyone with a coal briquette stove in their home will surely have even greater good fortune next year!

"Merry Christmas"!

### New Year's New Film Lineup for the Five Major Cinemas

— Xinying

Since the five major first-run cinemas changed their film screening times, it has been proven in the past few days that most Shanghai moviegoers have become accustomed to this new system. Especially the night show, from 8:00 to 10:00, most moviegoers think it is very suitable for today's Shanghai. This allows them to go home and sleep earlier, or if there are few vehicles and they can't get a ride, those who live nearby can walk back. If they are interested, they can also go to a cafe or nightclub near the cinema to spend two hours.

Although Christmas today has been affected by the war and there are not many films in stock, the five major cinemas will still show new films as usual for Christmas and the New Year. According to the news released by the cinemas, the lineup of new films to be released is as follows:

Cathay will screen "A Woman's Face", produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, starring Joan Crawford, Melvyn Douglas, and Conrad Veidt.

Grand Theater will screen "Ziegfeld Girl", starring James Stewart, Judy Garland, Hedy Lamarr, and Lana Turner.

Nanking will screen "The Great Lie", produced by Warner Bros., starring Bette Davis, George Brent, and Mary Astor.

Cathay will screen "Smilin' Through", starring Jeanette MacDonald, Robert Taylor, and Brian Aherne.

Metropole will screen "The Big Store", also produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, starring the Marx Brothers and Tony Martin. This is a comedy. These new films have all met Shanghai moviegoers on the eve of Christmas, and the content is very exciting. They are all productions above the standard of this year's Hollywood.

### Notes on Listening to Opera

— Jian Zhou

Recently, the playing time of operas has been changed due to the changes in gold. The opera repertoire is as hard as ever! The other day, I went as a guest and was very entertained by the audio-visual enjoyment. I recorded it as follows:

First up was Cui Ping Shan. Gao Shenglin's Shi Xiu had a clear and energetic voice, very similar to Xiao Lou. However, the singing lacked strength and was perfunctory. Gao originally had a good voice, but why did it come to this? The expression of quarreling with his family and the knife technique of killing You are still acceptable. Liu Binkun's Hai Monk, playing with Buddhist beads is a must. Furong Cao's Qiaoyun and Miao Shengchun's Yang Xiong, one fierce and shrewish, and the other haggard and weak, are both able to play their roles appropriately. Next was Qiao Lianhuan. Ai Shiju played Shi Qian, with light and quick hands and feet, and crisp lines, not inferior to Ye Shengzhang. The short steps were especially well-trained. The play of tricking the shopkeeper and stealing chickens to eat fire was wonderful in revealing the rogue tone everywhere, making people laugh. Next was Selling Horses. Zhen Fei's Zhao Chong, whether in his body, mouth, or gestures, was all wonderful to the smallest detail. I have watched it many times, and I don't think there will be a second person in the world who can play this role. The Guizhi corner is not enough to match unless it is Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu's magnanimity and nobility. Although Hou Yulan is still able to perform, she is still young and her skills are not yet up to par. In comparison, Zhen Fei's exquisite refining is even more evident. Wang Shaoting's Li Qi got the word "solid". Next was Qun Ying Hui. Cheng Jixian's Zhou Yu, except for the singing skills being slightly inferior, the playing with the feathers, the eye expressions, and the several feigned smiles were all superb. The predecessors' models are, after all, extraordinary! Xi Xiaobo, first as Lu Su and then as Kong Ming, worked very hard. It is a pity that his voice is strangely narrow. Although the rhyme is good, the voice seems to come from a jar, making people unable to listen comfortably. In the hiding books scene, when Jiang Gan helped the drunk into the room, Lu Su covered the lamp with his sleeve and quickly walked out. Xin Fang played this part, and had a wonderful quick walking posture, with the hat feathers trembling slightly, the sleeves of the water covering the lamp shaking, and a look of panic on his face. It was very good to see and walk. Xiao Bo did not have this, only slightly waved his beard. The arrow borrowing scene was neither warm nor fire, but the most exciting. Wang Shaoting's Kong Ming also had equal skills. The two yellow songs of borrowing the wind were purely in the style of Lian Liang. At this time, the ands of the table were rising, and the singing was covered. Ru Fuhui's Jiang Gan and Zhuang Ziyi's muddled state did not depart from the bookish air in the confusion. Di Fei's horse Fortune can be compared with the taste of the vulgar. Wang Quankui's Huang Gai and Yuan Shihai's Cao Cao can be said to be unparalleled. Wang's huge and loud voice is not easy to find in the theater world. Yuan's voice is broad and deep, and has both Hao's "ruthlessness", which is most suitable for playing Cao Cao's opera. When Jiang Gan stole the book back to the camp, Cao Zhongji wrongly killed Cai Mao. Jiang Gan still wanted to ask for credit. Yuan sang "You are a scholar, a basin of noodle paste" with a kind of shame and regret on his face, vividly depicting Aman's psychology at that time. Yuan Shihai's art is becoming more and more exquisite, and the limelight is very healthy. He also shines a big electric light when he comes on stage, and is treated like the protagonist. It can be said that he has won enough to lose. Xiao San Mazi took over the performance of Huayan Dao, which was ordinary. In the end, Er Jin Gong, Xi Hou Wang each bought the remaining bravery, meticulously and put their energy on the stage, which is much more. Among the three, Hou's skills were weaker, and he showed a slight panic when he spoke. Xi Wang sang heartily and never slacked off from beginning to end. The play ended at nine o'clock. It took seven hours from two o'clock. It is truly a new record for the chrysanthemum garden.

### Concerning "Plum Blossom Dream"

— He Yan

Perhaps few people know the story of Peng Yulin and Mei Xian. All that people know is that Peng Yulin commanded the naval forces to fight against the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. They know nothing else. The play "Plum Blossom Dream" introduces Peng Yulin to the public, what kind of person he was, and tells everyone what kind of influence his personality and thoughts were subjected to.

Although Peng Yulin was a famous general of the late Qing Dynasty who attacked the Taiping Army, he was a revolutionary thinker. Under the oppression of the Qing Dynasty, Peng Yulin was originally a "loyal" minister. However, due to the righteous encouragement and persuasion of his lover, Xiang Xian, he became enlightened. The plot here is certainly not simple. From Mei Xian to Yue Ergong, Peng Yulin also gained many lessons in spirit.

The original author of this play, Yi Zhengbi, is studying a novel subject, which is really rare. The fact that this play was adapted and directed by the famous director Fei Mu is the icing on the cake, lively and compact, needless to say. The method of handling it is a hundred times better than reading a biography of Peng Yulin or studying Peng Yulin's thoughts and actions.

According to reports, "Plum Blossom Dream" will soon be performed at the Xuan Palace Theater. The author learned some news: it is said that the performance period is around New Year's Day of the thirty-first year [of the Republic], and the plot is divided into seven acts. It is truly a grand spectacle. All the sets, costumes, and props are extremely luxurious. The total cost of this play is estimated at 20,000 yuan. As for the actors, they are still the famous actors who starred in "Qing Palace Grudges" and "Isolated Island Men and Women," and their acting skills are quite superb.

We sincerely hope that this play can be staged soon, so that it can shine on this desolate theater scene and satisfy the audience's eyes.

### Surprising Acrobatics on Poles

— Ze Fu

During the Han Dynasty, there was a "Du Lu searching and colliding" performance, which was actually what later generations called "pole climbing," also known as "long pole," "rope pole," "climbing pole," etc. Du Lu was the name of a Western Regions country, located in what is now Gansu Province. Its people were light and good at climbing, so they could perform this play. According to the "Western Capital Rhapsody" by Zhang Heng of the Han Dynasty, this kind of play was performed with a theatrical cart set up below, on which a tall pole was planted. (Note that "searching and building" is another name for a long pole; in ancient times, eight feet was considered a "searching.") The performers were mostly young children who climbed up the pole and performed all kinds of amazing feats on the pole. Among them, the most famous were two kinds of hanging: "hook hanging" and "abdominal spinning." "Hook hanging" involved a sudden inversion of the entire body, as if one had left the pole, but in fact, one foot was hooked upside down, switching between left and right, rising and falling suddenly, making people think they were about to fall. "Abdominal spinning" involved the performer using only their abdomen to support the top of the pole, with no hands or feet to hold on to, spinning in the air like a wind wheel facing the sky. In addition, other objects were placed on the pole. For example, the "Miscellaneous Records of Duyang" by Su E of the Tang Dynasty says: "The courtesan Shi Huo Hu brought five adopted daughters, only eight or nine years old. On a hundred-foot pole, she strung five bowstrings, allowing the five daughters to each stand on one, wearing five-colored clothes, holding halberds and spears, dancing to the music of the 'Breaking the Array,' moving up and down, crossing the beat like flying." This was even more amazing than before. No wonder Emperor Wenzong thought it was too dangerous and harmful and issued a prohibition order.

### Bloody Rain of Jade Petals

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 20: Welcoming Wax Candles on the Battlefield

Yuan Yuan was thirsty to see Wu Sangui and asked Bai Shi'er to send her to the front of the army as soon as possible to meet Wu Sangui and calm her heart. Bai Shi'er sent someone to Wu Sangui's army to report the news, and prepared a decorated carriage with a hundred strong men to escort Yuan Yuan to the army. Wu Sangui was overjoyed when he received this news, wishing he could meet the beauty immediately. He immediately ordered his attendants to take care of her along the way, and instructed Chai Ying's army to prepare a welcome. He erected colorful arches outside his jade tent, gathered drums and music, and prepared gorgeous clothes embroidered with Zhai patterns and precious jade rings, as well as fragrant jia nan incense. He also refurbished a decorated sedan chair, covering it with many colorful balls and adorning it with many fresh flowers, drawn by four dragon steeds, all covered with colorful leather and hung with colorful silk and bells. Banners and drums lined up for thirty li, and he personally went to greet her with dozens of guards, led by Wan Mingma. The news caused a stir in the army. Ma Bao, Bai Xianzong, and others all came to congratulate Wu Sangui. Only Zhang Cangqiu and the other three were furious, secretly scolding Wu Sangui for being lustful and looking down on national affairs. But they also wanted to see Yuan Yuan's charming appearance, so they followed Ma Bao, Bai Xianzong, and others to pretend to congratulate him. When Wu Sangui greeted the officers and soldiers, he was secretly pleased to see the officers and soldiers on the left and right with their banners and ceremonial guards in great splendor. He also saw Bai Shi'er and others galloping on horseback from the opposite seat, so he reined in his horse and waited. When Bai Shi'er saw Wu Sangui, he dismounted and reported how he met Madam Chen. Wu Sangui was overjoyed and promised him a generous reward. After a while, Yuan Yuan's precious carriage arrived, but where was the magnificent splendor that Wu Sangui had prepared? Wu Sangui jumped off his golden saddle, walked to Yuan Yuan's carriage, lifted the curtain, and said, "Yuan Yuan, have you been well since we last met? I've been waiting for you here." As he spoke, he saw Yuan Yuan dressed in盛裝華服 and sitting upright in the carriage, and was pleased that the jade beauty's grace was still the same as it was back then, except that her face was slightly thinner.

### Christmas Anecdotes of Movie Stars

— Bo Fen

A year before last, Clark Gable gave Carole Lombard a very special Christmas present: a three-hundred-pound carving of Carole, with the inscription on the back: "Merry Christmas to Carole."

The old comedian Frank Morgan has a habit: every Christmas, he doesn't buy Christmas cards himself, but takes the ones his friends sent him years ago, crosses out the names, adds the phrase "returned as is," and sends them back to those friends. But this is not malicious.

Nine years ago, Dolores del Rio had a most unhappy and painful Christmas. At that time, she was a bookkeeper in a ten-cent store in Chicago, but she was fired on Christmas Eve and couldn't even get a piece of leftover turkey. There is a large pine tree in front of Judy Garland's house. Last Christmas, she specially hired electricians to decorate the tree into an extraordinarily bright Christmas tree, costing more than 500 yuan.

One Christmas morning, Hugh Herbert's doorbell rang. When he opened the door, he saw a cow with a Christmas card around its neck that read: "Wishing you a Merry Christmas from Meisha Oya." A wonderful person always has wonderful things.

### Gong Jianong Wanders in the Film Circle

— Yi Qing

Unable to go to Batavia after leaving Datong

Although there are many nouveau riche in the film circle (referring to newly debuted practitioners in general), there are also many veterans who dominated the scene for a time. Gong Jianong is one we are familiar with, from Mingxing to today, he has always kept up with the times, even though his days as a young leading man have passed.

It is said that Gong Jianong held a very high position in the Datong film studio. Not long ago, he even directed "Lonely Soul in the Dark Night," written by Li Amao. But he was not satisfied with this. When Wu Cun telegraphed him from Batavia, inviting him to seek development there, he accepted and prepared to go south by boat. At that time, the Datong authorities secretly knew that he was about to leave Shanghai, so they gave him a script and ordered him to direct it, partly to find out his intentions and partly to imply that they wanted to retain him. However, he was determined to seek advancement and resolutely declined, resigning from Datong at the same time.

Unexpectedly, just as he was about to leave Shanghai, the situation suddenly changed, and he was unable to take a boat to Hong Kong and then to Batavia. And so he began to wander in the film circle, because when he prepared to return to Datong, the Datong authorities refused him!

But I wonder when this famous "Round-the-City Bus" (his nickname) will resume service with the film circle!
