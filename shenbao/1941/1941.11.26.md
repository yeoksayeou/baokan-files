### Report: US and Japan Agree to Prevent War; Discussing a Partial Agreement Plan; Hull Re-invites Representatives from China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands for Discussions; Washington and Berlin Simultaneously Engage in Political Warfare

Havas Agency, New York, 25th – A correspondent for the New York Times in Washington reports that Secretary of State Hull, "after a long conversation yesterday with Nomura and Kurusu, is said to have discussed a partial agreement plan to ease US-Japan tensions and prevent war from breaking out in the Pacific. The content is said to include: Japan abandoning its territorial aspirations in the South Pacific and eastern Siberia; Japan withdrawing its troops from Vietnam to alleviate the concerns of democratic countries about the invasion of Thailand or the Dutch East Indies, while also reducing the risk of attacks on the Burma Road; the United States unfreezing a portion of Japan's funds in the US and partially lifting commercial restrictions; Japan being able to obtain necessary raw materials from overseas, especially from Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies."

United Press, London, 25th – Political and diplomatic observers here are increasingly convinced that the US-Japan negotiations in Washington are currently focused on discussing a "temporary compromise" with Japan. They believe that this temporary compromise would last about a month. If the Washington negotiations succeed, then concluding a "temporary agreement" will be the prelude to negotiations, followed by more permanent arrangements based on the Nine-Power Treaty. However, experts estimate that even if there is a possibility of reaching a temporary agreement, the chances are only "fifty-fifty." It would not be surprising if the United States suggested that Japan withdraw from South China and Vietnam during the compromise period, and that Japan would not engage in southward or northward aggression. If Japan withdraws from Vietnam, the Burma Road would be safe, and the difficulties there would be eliminated. At the same time, it is expected that democratic countries may reduce some of their economic sanctions against Japan. Japan may be willing to withdraw its troops from southern Vietnam and move them to northern Vietnam, or even guarantee not to engage in southward aggression. It is believed that Japan may point to the neutrality pact signed with Stalin in April, which already guarantees non-aggression to the north, and may not be willing to make new guarantees. Japan may also demand the restoration of economic relations with democratic countries as they were before July 26, the unfreezing of all Japanese funds, and the removal of restrictions imposed by Britain and the United States.

United Press, Washington, 25th – Secretary of State Hull summoned representatives from China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands to the State Department yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM (5:00 AM Shanghai time). This meeting, during the current US "peace or war negotiations" with Japan, was their second in three days. Hull had a two-hour meeting with Nomura and Kurusu on Saturday night, and rumors have been rife that the talks are progressing smoothly. It is widely believed that Hull will give a favorable report on the latest round of talks, as an official announcement was made on Saturday stating that the ABCD powers are maintaining close consultation with the United States on the negotiations, and that the United States will take the lead in the Pacific talks. In the press room, Hull solemnly pointed out that, so far, the talks have been limited to exchanging opinions and have not yet entered the stage of making decisions. It is widely believed that the previous meeting of democratic countries was tantamount to warning Japan that the ABCD powers are currently united in a coordinated and unified manner to counter Japan's further aggression. Those invited to attend included British Ambassador Halifax, Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih, Dutch Minister Loudon, and Australian Minister Casey.

United Press, Washington, 25th – British Ambassador Halifax told the press after the meeting that, apart from the statement issued last Saturday that the ABCD powers are united in supporting the US stance in the Pacific situation, he had nothing else to say. When asked if he was still optimistic, Halifax said that he still stood by his Saturday statement and remained optimistic. Later, a State Department official said, "This is a continuation of discussions that have already taken place, and further meetings are being considered."

Reuters, Washington, 25th – One of the largest political wars is currently being waged on three fronts: Washington, Tokyo, and Berlin. The issue of peace or war in the Pacific will apparently depend on this. As far as can be seen from here, the German anti-communist conference aims to have Japan reaffirm its moral obligations under the anti-Comintern Pact. German diplomats in Tokyo are reportedly constantly trying to get Japan to clash with Britain and the United States. The political war in Washington is even more complex. Japan hopes to find out whether the United States is merely making threatening statements and whether Japan can gain something without participating in the war. Although the United States wants to avoid conflict in the Pacific, it is unwilling to sacrifice or compromise the policies and principles that have governed its actions in Asia for many years. How the talks between Hull and Kurusu are progressing is being kept highly secret by officials, and rumors are rife that Kurusu has not yet made any proposals but is only discussing the situation with Hull and seeking to ascertain the US position, after which the Japanese cabinet will decide its course. Hull has only issued a few words about the US-Japan talks, constantly adjusting the situation, which is still in the preliminary exploratory stage. However, rumors say that the United States has indeed put forward concrete measures to Japan. It is expected that the five-power meetings convened on Saturday, Sunday, and yesterday are a sign that the situation has reached a critical stage. Some say that the sudden convening of the meeting of representatives from China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands by the State Department yesterday afternoon, forty-eight hours after the last US-Japan talks, is a kind of psychological warfare by the United States against Japan, to prevent Japan from boasting too much at the Berlin conference. The United States sincerely wants to eliminate the possibility of war in the Pacific, but local people still cannot help but have doubts about whether Japan can accept the conditions that the United States will inevitably put forward, such as the withdrawal of Japanese troops in China and elsewhere in Asia. After all, Japan's withdrawal of troops is tantamount to failure in China, and the domestic repercussions in Japan may be serious. The vigorous arguments made by Japanese leaders and newspapers have not yet indicated that Japan can or is willing to accept the conditions that the United States will inevitably put forward based on its moral position under the Nine-Power Treaty and the Atlantic Charter. The meetings of representatives from China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands on Saturday and Sunday seem to have been very satisfactory and unanimous in their opinions. This fact can be seen as a confirmation of the steadfastness of the US attitude. The United States has never made any unnecessary appeasement proposals to Japan, whose economic situation is already precarious and whose war against the United States will inevitably lead to failure. Some observers familiar with the situation in the East believe that the greatest danger is that Japan will go against its own interests on its current path, preferring to wage a suicidal war against the United States rather than suffer the shame of betraying the Axis powers and withdrawing its troops in China.

Tokyo Issues Instructions: Talks Will Have New Developments

Haito Agency, Tokyo, 25th – Sources here claimed yesterday that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued another instruction regarding the US-Japan talks to US Ambassador Nomura and Special Envoy Kurusu. This instruction should allow the talks to make progress, but the content of the instruction has not been released. Political figures warned against expressing optimism because of this development.

Reuters, Tokyo, 25th – Well-informed observers here expect new developments in US-Japan relations soon, as Foreign Minister Togo is currently holding meetings day and night with senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to study the reports from the Japanese ambassador to the United States. They believe that Hull's meeting with representatives from China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands has created new difficulties in the US-Japan talks. Hull's convening of the ABCD meeting not only informed them of the progress of the US-Japan talks but also used this as a tool to restrain Japan, truly killing two birds with one stone.

Japanese Newspapers Launch Fierce Tirade, Accusing the US of Implementing Encirclement Tactics

Reuters, Tokyo, 25th – This morning, local newspapers openly criticized the five-power conference in Washington. Miyako Shimbun called it a "conference of thieves discussing law." The military newspaper Kokumin Shimbun opposed any third party intervening in resolving the US-Japan dispute and argued that if the United States allows such countries (China, Britain, and the Netherlands) to exert influence and insists on refusing Japan to practice its principles, then it should declare the breakdown of the Washington negotiations.

United Press, Tokyo, 25th – Japanese newspapers today again attacked the United States, accusing it of continuing its anti-Japanese encirclement tactics regardless of the continuation of the Washington talks. Jiji Shinpo prominently published a special dispatch from Guangzhou, accusing the United States of using the Philippines as a stepping stone, "attempting to seize hegemony over China and the southwestern Pacific under the pretext of assisting China." Asahi Shimbun published news that the Chinese side has concentrated 300,000 troops in southwestern China to defend the Yunnan-Burma Road, as a measure to prevent Japan from ending the Sino-Japanese War. Jiji Shinpo also carried news from Stanford that the newly appointed Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, is going to Washington, his main purpose being to establish a US-Soviet mutual agreement. The telegram claimed that it came from the US side and said that the Soviet Union proposed providing the United States with naval and air bases to contain Japan, disregarding the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. It also claimed that as a result of this proposal, the Soviet Union may become part of the encirclement of Japan.

### Thailand Senses the Threat of War; Calls Up Reservists; Believes Friendly Nations Will Provide Assistance

United Press, Bangkok, 15th – Bangkok official radio announced today that the Thai government has begun preparations to cope with a large-scale war. Radio said, "Although Thailand's involvement in the Pacific War seems inevitable, there is still a faint hope for peace. If the Thai government is forced to abandon its neutrality policy, Thailand will welcome the assistance of friendly nations, who will be happy to help us." Radio also announced that several classes of reservists have been called up. Radio also appealed to Britain, the United States, and Japan to avoid war in the Pacific and asked the public to abide by the government's strict policy of neutrality.

### Britain Resolves to Go All Out to Back the US; An Expression from Te Water

Reuters, Wellington, 25th – British War Cabinet Far East Representative Te Water spoke here last night about Britain's resolve to back the United States when the United States is drawn into the Pacific War, saying that there is complete understanding and no secrets between the British and American governments. Britain will go all out to back the United States in the Pacific, as Mr. Churchill has already said. Referring to the suggestion that Britain should appoint a permanent commissioner to the Pacific region, Te Water said that he had investigated the matter and reported to the British government.

### Bomb Explodes at US Consulate in Saigon; Case Under Investigation

United Press, Washington, 25th – The State Department announced yesterday that a high-explosive bomb exploded at the US Consulate in Saigon on Sunday. It is not known who placed the bomb. According to a report from US Consul Brown in Saigon, the walls, doors, and furniture of the consulate were damaged by the bomb, but there were no deaths or injuries, indicating that the bomb was placed on the floor outside the entrance. So far, the consulate has not obtained conclusive evidence as to who placed the bomb.

Reuters, Henan, 25th – Police are now investigating the bombing of the US Consulate in Saigon on Sunday night.

### Overseas Japanese Withdraw to Return Home; Over Ten Thousand Already

Haito Agency, Tokyo, 25th – According to official sources here yesterday, since the freezing of Japanese funds, more than 10,000 Japanese have withdrawn from the four countries whose funds have been frozen, most of them returning from the United States, India, Singapore, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies.

Reuters, Tokyo, 25th – Today, Information Bureau spokesman Kiishi Kazuichi hosted a group of reporters, who asked many questions about the US-Japan talks but were unable to obtain concrete information. When reporters asked whether the Tatsuta Maru's trip to the United States could be seen as a result of the Washington talks, the spokesman declined to answer. When asked whether the Tatsuta Maru should be called a ship "evacuating Japanese residents," the spokesman replied that since the United States issued the freezing order, many Japanese residents in the United States naturally had no reason to stay for long. Therefore, the dispatch of the Tatsuta Maru was only a matter of transporting passengers and mail to ease the inconvenience felt by both sides. As a result of negotiations with the Panamanian government, the Tatsuta Maru will also sail through Balboa to carry back Japanese residents who currently have no means of returning home. This is because the Panamanian government recently issued an order to crack down on Eastern expatriates. The Japanese government has protested about this matter but has not yet received a satisfactory response.

### Japan-Portugal Air Service Begins

Reuters, Tokyo, 2-5 – The new Japanese air service between Dili, the capital of Portuguese Timor, and Palau Island, which is administered by Japan, began today, with a Japanese plane flying from Palau Island to Dili.

### Axis Partners Sign Protocol; Anti-Comintern Pact Extended for Five Years; Signatories Expand from Six to Thirteen Countries; Finland, Bulgaria, and Others Included

Haito Agency, Berlin, 25th – Representatives of the governments of Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Hungary, and Manchukuo signed a protocol to commemorate the Anti-Comintern Pact concluded in 1936, stating that the pact has been effective and that continued cooperation is still necessary to deal with common enemies. Therefore, it has now been decided that the Anti-Comintern Pact will be extended for another five years from November 25, 1941. The entry into force of the treaty for countries that have now joined the treaty will take effect from the date that the German government receives their formal documentation. The Protocol further stipulates that after the expiry of the five-year extension period, the countries should continue to consult with each other and discuss continued cooperation issues. Today's commemoration ceremony was held at noon at the German Foreign Ministry. After Foreign Minister Ribbentrop gave a speech, the protocol was read out and signed, followed by speeches by the representatives of Italy, Japan, Spain, Hungary, and Manchukuo. Finally, the representatives of the seven countries wishing to join the Anti-Comintern Pact verbally expressed their intentions and submitted written memoranda. The seven countries are Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Croatia, Romania, Slovakia, and the Nanjing government. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop then issued a statement before the meeting adjourned.

Haito Agency, Berlin, 25th – The governments of Germany, Italy, Japan, Hungary, Manchukuo, and Spain recently signed a protocol at noon today at the Head of State's Office to extend the Anti-Comintern Pact for a period of five years. The full text is as follows: The governments of the six countries, Germany, Italy, Japan, Hungary, Manchukuo, and Spain, acknowledge that the agreement to resist the activities of the Comintern has been extremely satisfactory since its inception. For the sake of the future common interests of the countries, it is necessary to cooperate closely to cope with common enemies. It has therefore been decided to extend the term of the agreement for five years and the following provisions have been agreed: 1. The Anti-Comintern Pact, the Supplementary Book of November 25, 1936, the Protocol of November 6, 1937, the Protocol on Hungary's accession to the Pact of February 24, 1939, the Protocol on Manchukuo's accession to the Pact of February 24, 1939, and the Protocol on Spain's accession to the Pact of March 27, 1939, shall all be extended for a period of five years from November 25, 1941. 2. Any country that has officially announced its accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact at the invitation of the governments of Germany, Italy and Japan shall notify the German Government again by written declaration, which shall then be notified by Germany to the countries concerned. The German Government shall take effect from the date of receipt of its written declaration. This protocol shall be made in triplicate in German, Japanese and Italian, each of which is the original text. Before the expiry of the five-year period, the countries shall consult each other to discuss future cooperation issues. The representatives signing this Protocol are granted special privileges by the governments of the respective countries and have signed this Protocol, totaling six copies, 1941, 11th month, 25th day.

The Puppet Exhibition Is Worth Pondering

Reuters, London, 25th – Several major newspapers in London this morning criticized Hitler's anti-communist "puppet exhibition" in editorials. The Times said that the Anti-Comintern Pact had been placed in cold storage for many years and has now been taken out again. Why was the anniversary of the pact in 1939 or 1940 not celebrated? The reason is obvious. No one is foolish enough to ask why Hitler happily canceled the pact based on the idea of 1939, and now he is happily reviving it on the fifth anniversary of its signing. The contrast between the two is worth pondering. None of the countries now signing the pact attaches more importance to it than Germany. Japan once attached importance to it, but at that time it had not yet realized Hitler's talent for turning clouds and rain. The Japanese opinions were enlightened by Ribbentrop's ruthlessness in August 1939, and shocked by Hitler's perfidy and violence in June 1941. Judging from the phenomenon, the conveners of this conference paid special attention to Japan. Recently, Japan's approach to Washington has made Berlin very worried and uneasy, so it seems to be the right time to make this soft-kneed partner return to its arms. However, Japanese politicians have not forgotten that Matsuoka's signing of the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact in April of this year was due to Hitler's insidious encouragement, and it seems unlikely that they will be moved by this kind of blatant trick. The arguments of other newspapers are roughly the same. According to Reuters diplomatic reporters, Hitler originally planned to convene a New Order Conference in Moscow on November 17 to celebrate the failure of the Soviet Union and launch a peace offensive, but seeing that the invasion of the Soviet Union had failed, he changed his original plan and convened a meeting of the signatories of the Anti-Comintern Pact in Berlin. The first meeting was held in 1936, but in 1939 Germany turned to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, and the Anti-Comintern Pact was abandoned. Now that the five-year term has expired, German diplomacy has resumed the old affairs, and representatives of the Axis powers gathered in Berlin yesterday. The first to arrive was Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, followed by the Hungarian Foreign Minister and others. Representatives from Spain and Japan will also participate.

The Soviet-Japanese Agreement Remains Valid

Reuters, Tokyo, 25th – Official opinion here believes that the continued accession of the seven countries, including Finland, to the Anti-Comintern Pact has no impact on the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. When government officials were asked about this point, they firmly replied that this was a completely different matter and said that Japan recognized that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact was still valid.

Reuters, Tokyo, 25th – The Information Bureau issued a statement today stating that the Japanese government believes that the expansion of the Anti-Comintern Pact and the participation of the seven new countries are of great significance. The six signatory countries of the pact (Germany, Italy, Japan, Manchukuo, Hungary, and Spain) have agreed to extend the pact for five years. The seven new countries joining are the Nanjing regime, Bulgaria, Finland, Romania, Denmark, Slovakia, and Croatia. It goes without saying that the Comintern, with its worldwide organization, is engaged in activities of a communist nature. Therefore, the scope of defense must also be extended to the whole world. Japan, with the construction of a New Order in East Asia as the basis of its national policy, deeply feels that the defense against the Communist Party is increasingly necessary and believes that the continuation of this Anti-Comintern Pact and the continued accession of seven countries is indeed worth celebrating.

### Communist Political Committee Holds Meeting in Yan'an: Urges All Political Parties to Cooperate; Chinese Communist Party Determined to Implement Democratic Principles

Chongqing - While the National Political Council was holding a meeting in Chongqing, the Communist Political Committee of the Shaanxi-Ningxia-Gansu Border Region also held a meeting in Yan'an, the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party in northern Shaanxi. They also sent a telegram calling on all political parties in China to cooperate to the greatest extent possible. People here have paid great attention to this because of its extremely friendly tone towards the Kuomintang. In a telegram to the Central Headquarters of the Kuomintang, the Yan'an meeting expressed admiration for the glorious achievements of the Kuomintang in leading the country in the struggle for freedom and democracy, and called for continued enhancement of cooperation between the various political parties. The telegrams sent to the various leaders of the Kuomintang here used the same wording. People here are particularly interested in the speech given by Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, at the Yan'an meeting. Mao said that the goal of the Chinese Communist Party is to cooperate with all political parties to realize the democratic principles of the founding father of the nation, and that China does not have the prerequisites for implementing communism. Mao also said that the social structure of China is like a cone, with the base representing the vast majority of the people in the lower classes, and the apex representing the very small number of large capitalists and landlords. The purpose of the CCP is to maintain a stable balance of interests between landlords and peasants, and between capitalists and laborers. Mao also urged non-communists to cooperate with each other for the sake of the national interest, and asked the Chinese Communists to correct their previous views, saying that many communists were misled by the theory of isolationism, alienated non-communists, and always thought they were infallible, and did not realize that communists should have the obligation to cooperate with people outside the party to build democracy. No power can prevent others from speaking, and no power can monopolize all institutions. We must allow others to express their opinions, and we cannot learn from them.

### British Troops Land on French Coast Briefly

Completed Mission and Safely Withdrew

Reuters, London, 25th - It was officially announced here today that a small squad of British patrol soldiers landed in Normandy on Sunday night and have all safely returned. The above announcement was made in response to reports from the German side that they had repelled a British attempt to land on the French coast. The Information Department issued a routine statement saying that regarding the coastal areas of the occupied territories of France, the enemy is quite concerned about how we intend to act. Therefore, they hope to use deliberately exaggerated propaganda to induce us to reveal the truth. The landing mentioned in the German communique may refer to the landing of a small squad of British patrol soldiers in Normandy on the evening of November 23. The entire patrol team had returned to the ship, and only one person was shot in the arm by a machine gun.

Editorial

### Peace or War?

US-Japan negotiations have been going on for three months. What exactly is being discussed is a question of concern to the world, and only facts can provide the answer. In the current stage, there are three points worth remembering: First, US Secretary of State Hull has formally stated that the nature of the current negotiations is "exploratory." Second, the authorities of China, Britain, and other countries have also repeatedly formally stated that they are kept informed of the details of the US-Japan negotiations. Third, it is gratifying that after the meeting between Hull and Kurusu, Nomura, and others the day before yesterday, they immediately convened a meeting of diplomatic representatives from China, Britain, and other countries.

There is another issue more important than the specific content of the negotiations, which is: what is the future of the US-Japan negotiations?

If the question that urgently awaits Japan's answer is peace or war, then, judging from various objective circumstances, its current situation is that peace is very difficult and war is very dangerous. But for the United States, the sacrifice is very light in war, and peace is always beneficial. These are the two most fundamental points in the current Far Eastern situation. On the one hand, they explain the recent bewilderment and panic of the Japanese authorities; on the other hand, they also explain the composure and leisure of the United States. In these two absolutely opposite situations, we still cannot find automatic agreement and harmony, or forced compromise and accommodation. Then, it is not difficult to imagine the future of these US-Japan negotiations.

Let's first look at the Japanese side. The biggest reason for its current hesitation between peace and war is, of course, the uncertainty of the outcome of the German-Soviet War. If Germany can defeat the Soviet army, or rush to the Caucasus and the Middle East, or even occupy Moscow and Leningrad, then the decision of Japan's attitude will be a relatively easy task. On the one hand, it can issue warnings and demands to Britain and the United States to respond to the German-Italian Western offensive, launching the greatest threat of northern advance, and force Britain and the United States to recognize its "Greater East Asia New Order"; on the other hand, in the event of a final crisis, a major war in the Pacific, it can also quickly take risks, attempting to repel the Soviet military power in the Far East in one fell swoop, eliminating its worries, and then turn around to engage in a contest with Britain and the United States in the Pacific, with Northeast China, the Soviet Maritime Province, and the occupied areas of North China as its bases on the continent. If the failure of the Soviet Union has become an irreversible and fixed fact, then the complete disillusionment of the East-West "New Order" attempts will be a natural conclusion. However, the current uncertainty of the victory or defeat of Germany and the Soviet Union makes it very difficult. At this time, if Japan rashly provokes the United States, then without a doubt, it will immediately fall into a difficult situation of fighting on all sides. Perhaps Germany will suffer defeat in the West, and the crisis that Japan will face at that time will probably be unprecedented in its history. So, will Japan accept the path of peace? The only possible ways to take this path are either to completely surrender to the forces of justice and abandon the attempt of the "New Order," or to let things take their course and continue the current situation of delay. If it is the former, then Japan's ambitions of several decades will be declared forever abandoned; if it is the latter, then the severity of the economic blockade pressure that Japan is currently under will one day lead it onto an irreversible path. In short, the unclear outcome of the Western battlefield is really the biggest factor in Japan's current bewilderment and distress. Perhaps there is no politician in Japan who dares to assert the victory or defeat of the German-Soviet war. Therefore, there is no Japanese leader who dares to rashly decide its fundamental national policy at this time, whether to accept peace or engage in war.

Looking at it from another perspective, the environment in which the United States is currently located is a very striking contrast compared to Japan. If its fundamental policy towards Japan is decided by war, then the meaning of that war, for it, is at most a large expenditure of money and a large-scale expedition of materials and war equipment. Of course, the skies, land, and sea of its own country will not become battlefields, and the lives of its people will not be affected. Even the expedition of personnel can be reduced to a minimum number in the situation where China, Britain, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and other countries are all fighting against Japan. Moreover, in the situation where the superior and inferior forces are absolutely disparate, it almost has a 120% chance of winning and has no need to worry about the future of such a war. This is fundamentally different from Japan's nationwide fear that it may turn into a battlefield and that a major disaster is imminent. Conversely, if the United States decides to continue to follow the path of peace in its policy towards Japan, then, whether it is to use political pressure to force Japan to surrender immediately, or to use a temporary laissez-faire approach to allow the current situation of heavy clouds but no rain to continue to drag on, the United States still holds the most important key. When using the first method, the United States can unite all the powers in the Far East and launch a common oppression against Japan, making Japan face an overwhelming advantage and having no choice but to surrender immediately. When using the second method, the United States has economic sanctions, the most deadly means against Japan, causing its current resources to be slowly depleted and gradually reaching a dead end; at the same time, the United States intensifies its assistance to Britain and the Soviet Union, promoting the failure of Germany and Italy, and supporting China's brave fight, accelerating the arrival of the total counteroffensive. Once Germany and Italy collapse, the situation in the Far East will definitely be easily resolved, not to mention that China will then launch a decisive counteroffensive! In short, under the established national policy of the United States, whether it is peace or war, it has a very wide range of room for maneuver, and what is especially important is that its chances of defeating Japan are now almost 100% in both aspects. Therefore, the withdrawal of the US Marines stationed in the Far East has already indicated that it is preparing for war by preventing any challenges from Japan; after the arrival of the Japanese special envoy Kurusu in Washington, the United States still accepted Japan's request and reopened negotiations with it, which also indicated that the United States indeed has full confidence and is not afraid to follow the path of peace to achieve its own goals.

However, looking deeper, the role and promotion of various other international factors are making the environments and attitudes of both Japan and the United States themselves tend to be more complex. There are two points worth pointing out here: First, the issue of the British and Soviet counteroffensives against Germany and Italy is causing them to not only demand a large amount of material assistance from the United States, but also to constantly expect the participation of American manpower, and this demand from Britain is especially obvious and urgent. When the United States participates in the counteroffensive, its first step is of course to resolve the unstable forces in the East first. Second, the predicament in which Germany and Italy find themselves is also causing them to constantly demand that Japan quickly respond in the East and attack the rear of Britain and the Soviet Union. If Japan intends to take advantage of the achievements of Germany and Italy's victory in the future and does not voluntarily withdraw from the Tripartite Pact, then it must obey the demands of Germany and Italy and respond to them with action at the appropriate time.

Finally, judging from the situation, before the spring of next year, neither the British and Soviet demands for American participation nor the German and Italian urging for Japanese response will reach a decisive stage, and before that, the issue of peace and war between the United States and Japan does not seem to be coming to a final juncture.

### German Troops Vigorously Attack, Moscow's Situation Critical; Soviet Troops Assemble Reserves for Desperate Battle, Central Area Covered in Vast Expanse of White Snow

Reuters, London, 25th Dispatch: Moscow is currently facing its most severe crisis since the German attacks began. It is said that the German High Command has announced the capture of Solnechnogorsk. If this is true, then German troops are only 30 miles northwest of Moscow. The German side has claimed that this is the closest the German troops have been to Moscow. Although this has not been confirmed, dispatches from Moscow admit that large German tank forces have approached Klin. The Soviet "News" newspaper stated that if Hitler does not try his best now, he will never succeed. Soviet radio broadcasts stated that Soviet troops north of Moscow have abandoned three locations and retreated to new positions. At the same time, fresh Soviet troops are continuously heading to the front lines. According to the Soviet official news agency, troops are being transported by train day and night westward from the east, south, and north of the Soviet Union. Tanks and armored vehicles are also being transported west to the front lines. The Soviet Union has just now deployed reserve troops to fight.

United Press, London, 25th Dispatch: Moscow Radio reported a short time ago that Hitler's troops yesterday launched a fierce attack on the Soviet capital on the Klin Highway amidst heavy snow. Two armored divisions and one motorized division have passed Klin and are approaching the main highway after passing the area around point K. The radio stated that our army is continuing to reinforce and is making every effort to defend against the enemy. It is reported that Soviet resistance around Volokolamsk is particularly fierce, and the Soviet lines in the Naro-Fominsk area are still being held by Soviet troops. However, Soviet troops in the Mozhaisk area have been retreating under pressure. Regarding the rumored German vanguard reaching Solnechnogorsk, 31 miles from Moscow, Soviet sources have not yet confirmed this. Moscow dispatches also stated that there has been heavy snow in the entire area in recent days, and the cold is increasing. Many Germans have been freezing. The houses and streets of Moscow are covered in thick snow, creating a vast expanse of white.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th Dispatch: According to an official German announcement, the town of Solnechnogorsk in the distant suburbs of Moscow has been occupied by German troops. The town is located 50 kilometers northwest of Moscow, has a population of 6,500, several factories, and has village houses and recreational areas, purely suburban scenery. The railway from Leningrad to Moscow passes through the town. The fall of the town has completely isolated Moscow from the Volga region southeast of Kalinin.

Reuters, London, 25th Dispatch: German troops on the Moscow front continue to attack fiercely, and a desperate battle is underway. It is reported that the German side has mobilized no fewer than 40 divisions for this attack on Moscow, while in October, the German side only sent 17 divisions to probe the Soviet capital. The Soviet side admits that Soviet troops have retreated in Klin and Tula, but Soviet troops are holding their ground elsewhere along the line, and the German advance is much slower than the initial attack on Moscow. The battle situation on the Moscow front from north to south can be described as follows: Heavy fighting is currently taking place in Kalinin (100 miles northwest of Moscow). German attempts to break through the Soviet lines have all been repelled. Volokolamsk (70 miles northwest of Moscow): German troops have advanced slightly along the Volokolamsk-Moscow highway, occupying several villages. Soviet troops are holding their ground and launching counterattacks. Mozhaisk (60 miles west-northwest of Moscow): Soviet troops have retreated in an orderly manner to defensive positions. German attacks along the highway have been repelled. Naro-Fominsk (40 miles southwest of Moscow): Soviet troops are holding the Nara River. A large German infantry force was defeated by Soviet troops, with about 600 killed or wounded. Maloyaroslavets (60 miles southwest of Moscow): No changes. German troops have not broken through the lines. Serpukhov (60 miles south of Moscow): The lines have also not been breached. Tula (110 miles south of Moscow): German troops with a slight advantage have advanced slightly southeast and east of the city. Large tank forces are engaged in a desperate battle. In one location, Soviet troops pushed back German troops four miles.

Southern Red Army Counterattacks Victoriously, Fierce Fighting Resumes in Crimea

Havas News Agency, Moscow, 25th Dispatch: An official announcement stated that the Red Army is advancing steadily on the southern front, with particularly rapid progress west of Rostov, advancing a total of 50-60 miles in the past two days, recapturing many villages and towns.

Reuters, Moscow, 25th Dispatch: Soviet troops are now carrying out counterattacks in Leningrad and Rostov, and have broken through ten kilometers west of Vishny Volochyok.

Reuters, London, 25th Dispatch: Moscow Radio stated last night that after a slight lull, fierce fighting has resumed on the Crimean Peninsula in the far south. The enemy has concentrated large forces in the right bay, and the fighting is particularly fierce. A Soviet unit has cut off a vital road and is launching a counterattack to block the enemy. Fighting is continuing in this area. According to German prisoners, the German 72nd Infantry Division has suffered heavy losses on the Crimean front.

### North African War Moves to Hilly Terrain, El Agheila Becomes the Center of the Battle, Tank Warfare Comes to an End, Infantry Seems to Rise, New Zealand Troops Occupy Gambut and Advance Towards Tobruk

Reuters, London, 25th Dispatch: Due to the heavy losses of tanks on both sides and the expansion of the war zone to hilly areas, the first stage of large-scale tank warfare in the Western Desert has come to an end, and infantry seems to be rising. News has come that the two armies have engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The center of the main battle is still El Agheila. As for whether the British troops breaking out of Tobruk have reunited with the main force, there is still no news. Indian troops between Halfaya Pass and Omar are still operating behind enemy defenses. After New Zealand troops occupied Gambut yesterday, they are now advancing towards Tobruk and may be able to participate in the main battle in time.

Reuters, Cairo, 25th Dispatch: New Zealand troops in North Africa are currently engaged in a wedge-shaped penetration in Gambut and Bardia. The British garrison in Tobruk is rapidly consolidating its positions and narrowing the gap south of Tobruk. It is reported that the gap is now only a few miles wide. Indian troops are still besieging the stubborn enemy in the Halfaya Pass and Omar area. South African troops have also joined the fierce hand-to-hand combat near El Agheila, south of Tobruk. In the war zone, there are two slopes that are close to each other, and there are winding valleys that flow into the sea, which are not suitable for large tanks to operate in. Last night, a British military spokesperson claimed that a large-scale tank battle had broken out around El Agheila, and the war had spread to a wide area, but it was still difficult to determine the outcome. Both sides are fighting with all their might, so the battle situation is extremely fierce. The occupation of Gambut is very important, as it is one of the enemy's main supply bases for turning to Gazala to obtain supplies. It is now believed that the German troops have withdrawn from the Gambut airfield. At the same time, the British Air Force continues to attack the Axis powers' supply bases. The number of tanks is gradually decreasing due to damage. However, both sides are able to quickly repair tanks on the battlefield. Previous news gave the impression that the air resistance encountered by the British was very weak. In fact, the enemy planes are resisting quite strongly, and there is a trend of becoming more intense. There are no major battles in the skies over the war zone or behind the British lines, but there are often fierce battles in the skies over the German-occupied areas, as the British Air Force flies to force the Axis planes to fight.

### United States Sends Army to Dutch Guiana to Protect Valuable Bauxite Mines, Agreement Obtained in Advance with the Dutch Government

Reuters, Washington, 25th Dispatch: The White House announced yesterday that a U.S. military unit has been ordered to go to Suriname in Dutch Guiana, South America, to protect valuable bauxite mines, as the United States relies heavily on this for aluminum extraction. This mine protection measure was agreed upon by the U.S. and Dutch governments and endorsed by the Brazilian government. According to diplomatic circles, the reason why the Dutch government decided to ask the United States to protect its Guiana bauxite mines is because there have been frequent reports of Nazi activities in French Guiana. As for whether the U.S. government has received intelligence that the Nazis plan to destroy this mine, it has not been disclosed by officials. In 1940, Suriname produced 615,434 tons of bauxite. Encouraged by new procedures in the mining industry, it is expected to produce one million tons this year.

### U.S. Lend-Lease Act

Applicable to Free French Forces

Reuters, New York, 25th Dispatch: The representative of the Free French Forces in the United States announced yesterday that President Roosevelt has approved the Lend-Lease Act to apply to General de Gaulle's troops, as the U.S. President recognizes that the land under the jurisdiction of the Free French Forces is closely related to U.S. defense.

### Germany Plans to Reinforce North Africa from Greece, Many Ships Gather in Thessaloniki

Reuters, London, 25th Dispatch: According to American Broadcasting Corporation spokesman Aglansky in a broadcast from Ankara this morning, Germany may seek to transport new supplies into Libya via Crete. According to military sources in Ankara, a large number of tanks and military supplies have recently been transported by train from Vienna to Thessaloniki, with two or three trains arriving daily since November 15. This news was initially reported by a Turkish correspondent in Yugoslavia. The Axis powers have recently gathered about 150,000 tons of merchant ships in Thessaloniki. According to reliable sources, Italy and Romania have also transported military supplies to the port. Yesterday, British General Auchinleck in Libya stated in a broadcast that he had received intelligence that the Axis powers were now planning to send reinforcements to Libya from Greece and Italy. The British military attaché in Ankara said that Axis ships could travel along the Greek coast to Crete without danger. With German escort teams protecting them with aircraft, it would be easy to smuggle across to Libya from Crete at night. A large-scale Axis air force is currently gathered in Crete, it is said.

### U.S. Yangtze River Fleet in China Reduces Number of Patrol Ships, Flagship USS Luzon Still Moored in Shanghai for Defense, Two Shallow-Draft Gunboats Will Sail Back to Base

Madison Steamer Prepares Cargo Hold, Departure of U.S. Troops Delayed

Last night, sources within the U.S. Navy in Shanghai revealed that the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet in China had received orders from the Navy Department in Washington to withdraw part of its river defense gunboats. The exact number of ships to be withdrawn has not been fully determined. The destination will be Manila, the same as the Fourth Marine Regiment. The order was issued by Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet. Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the Yangtze River Fleet, received the order and immediately directed all of its gunboats to await orders. The Yangtze River Fleet belongs to the U.S. Asiatic Fleet and is under the command of Rear Admiral Bimees, Commander of the U.S. Far East Sixteenth Naval District. The fleet currently has five gunboats: USS Luzon (575 tons), USS Wake (450 tons), USS Tutuila (370 tons), and USS Mindanao. USS Tutuila is currently moored in Chongqing, and USS Mindanao is patrolling the waters off southern China. USS Luzon is stationed in Shanghai and serves as the fleet's flagship.

Reduction in Number of Ships Does Not Mean Full Withdrawal

International News Service, Washington, 25th Dispatch: The Navy Department announced yesterday that several of the seven U.S. gunboats serving in the Yangtze River Patrol will soon be withdrawn. The Navy Department did not announce the exact number of ships to be withdrawn or their destination. Two retreat ships from the President Lines company will carry the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment from Shanghai to Manila at the end of this week. Therefore, it is believed that these U.S. gunboats will follow these two ships to the Philippines. Since President Roosevelt announced his decision to withdraw the Marine Corps from China, it has been recognized that the withdrawal of U.S. Yangtze River gunboats will be inevitable. Therefore, this announcement by the Navy Department is not surprising. United Press International, Washington, 25th Dispatch: An official of the Navy Department announced yesterday that some American warships of the Yangtze River Patrol, under the command of Rear Admiral Glassford, will be withdrawn. A spokesperson for the Navy Department told the United Press International, "The Navy Department is now reducing the number of warships in the Yangtze River Patrol, but not leaving completely." The spokesperson did not say where these withdrawn warships would go, or the exact number of patrol warships ordered to remain on the Yangtze River. It is believed that this order will not affect the USS Tutuila, currently stationed in Chongqing, and the USS Mindanao, currently patrolling southern China.

USS Wake and USS Wake to Depart First

Although the U.S. Navy only stated that it would withdraw part of the Yangtze River Fleet, and did not mention the number, informed sources stated yesterday that the USS Tutuila and USS Mindanao will remain in their respective patrol areas. The USS Wake and USS Wake, which may be withdrawn within a considerable period of time, are the USS Wake, formerly moored in Wuhu, which arrived in Shanghai on the 23rd, and the USS Wake, moored in Hankou, which also left Hankou yesterday for Shanghai, with 30 soldiers, six officers, and Captain Harris on board. It is reported that the USS Wake is expected to arrive here within two days, and then withdraw together. At that time, personnel from the U.S. Navy Purchasing Office may leave Shanghai on these two ships. Their destination should be Manila, the current gathering place of the Asiatic Fleet.

Rear Admiral Glassford to Remain in Shanghai

Among the Yangtze River Fleet, the USS Tutuila is stationed in Chongqing and cannot be withdrawn, and the USS Mindanao is patrolling southern China and will not be withdrawn. Therefore, the fleet actually relies on the USS Luzon, USS Wake, and USS Wake. Since the U.S. Navy Department stated that there would be a partial withdrawal, there is no reason to order these three ships to leave China completely. Now that the USS Wake and USS Wake have left their original defense areas and come to Shanghai to await orders for withdrawal, the USS Luzon should naturally remain in Shanghai. This point has been confirmed by U.S. Navy authorities. Therefore, Rear Admiral Glassford will remain stationed in Shanghai and will not withdraw until there is a situation in the Pacific. Yesterday, foreign sources stated that the USS Luzon would remain until the final withdrawal, and if necessary, would carry U.S. government officials from Shanghai. The captain of the USS Luzon is Brock, and the entire ship has 70 soldiers and 24 officers, including Rear Admiral Glassford's staff.

Withdrawal Preparations Completed Long Ago

According to another source, the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet is part of the Asiatic Fleet. Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, ordered Rear Admiral Glassford in mid-month to make preparations for withdrawal. After receiving the order, Glassford completed the necessary preparations in the middle of this month, and will withdraw after the formal order arrives. It is also learned that the USS Wake and USS Wake will escort the first battalion of the Fourth Marine Regiment on the USS Harrison on Sunday to the Philippines.

First Batch of U.S. Troops Postponed Departure from Shanghai

According to reliable sources obtained last night, the Second Battalion of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the USS Madison this morning. Now, the ship has been ordered by the U.S. authorities to convert all of its cabins into dormitories so that each U.S. soldier can have a cot to adapt to military life. Therefore, it must be postponed. As for the First Battalion, it will leave Shanghai on the USS Harrison on the 30th without any changes. The "Farewell Broadcast" will be held at the new customs wharf at 10:15 am that day. Mr. Mackay, General Manager of Citibank, will be the reporter. In addition to the Regiment Commander Colonel Howard and the Yangtze River Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Glassford giving speeches, officers and soldiers of the team will be invited to give short talks at any time. As the team is about to leave Shanghai, it must load the camp onto the ship, so the team's motor transport team has been very busy in recent days. It is reported that representatives of the British Residents' Association and the U.S. Department of Commerce have scheduled a joint farewell party for Commander Howard and other officers at the Columbia Road Country Club from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm today, which will be a grand occasion. According to the U.S. Marine Corps officers who attended the public banquet of the American Chamber of Commerce the night before, that night was the best banquet they had participated in in Shanghai, so they felt more and more reluctant to leave Shanghai. Everyone who participated in the banquet was extremely happy.

### British Evacuation Ship Ming Sang Scheduled to Sail South

There is also talk of sailing to Yantai first to pick up evacuees

In order to speed up the departure of the more than 1,000 evacuees who have registered, the British Embassy has ordered the Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire shipping companies to allocate ships for evacuation as soon as possible. It is learned that Butterfield & Swire's Anhui Steamer will arrive in Shanghai as scheduled on the 28th. Jardine Matheson's Ming Sang Steamer was originally scheduled to carry passengers to Hong Kong, but was temporarily ordered to prepare specifically for evacuation, so all passenger tickets were transferred to the Yu Sang Steamer, which will sail to Hong Kong next. The Ming Sang Steamer is now scheduled to sail south to Hong Kong on the 3rd of next month. The Anhui and Ming Sang steamers can accommodate a total of 700-800 passengers. Currently, 275 people have registered for evacuation, so the British Embassy will continue to allocate ships to meet the needs. It is learned that the British evacuees leaving Shanghai will be transferred to Australia and India after arriving in Hong Kong. It is also learned that the Yu Sang Steamer left Shanghai for Hong Kong last Wednesday and arrived in Shantou. It was detained for two days due to the Japanese inspection of passenger feces and arrived safely in Hong Kong at noon yesterday. After the ship arrives in Shanghai on the next trip, it will carry passengers who have had their tickets refunded from the Ming Sang Steamer to Hong Kong. British residents in Yantai, North China, are also preparing to evacuate, and there is also talk of the Ming Sang Steamer going to Yantai to pick up evacuees.

### Japanese Side Plans to Send Special Ships to Evacuate Japanese Residents in Southeast Asia

Ten Ships Designated to Depart in Different Directions, Expected to Take Place in Late Month or Early Next Month

According to the Japanese newspaper, regarding the evacuation of Japanese residents from overseas, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorities issued a statement on the 24th, explaining everything. It is said that since the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands implemented asset freeze orders against Japan, Japanese residents in these countries and their territories have gradually found it difficult to maintain their lives and businesses. Therefore, the number of people hoping to return home has been increasing.

Designated Ship Names

In view of this, the Japanese government has negotiated with these countries, but these countries have no convenient ships for Japanese residents to take to evacuate. Recently, the number of Japanese residents in various places hoping to return home has increased more than before. Therefore, as a result of discussions between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the parties concerned, it was decided that the Japanese side would send ships to various places for Japanese residents to take to return home. Ryuta Maru, Hikawa Maru, and Taiyo Maru will be sent to Hawaii this month and next month, Hie Maru will go to the Indian Ocean, Fuso Maru, Asama Maru, and Hakone Maru will go to the Straits Settlements and the Philippines, Takachiho Maru, Nissho Maru, and Fuji Maru will go to the Dutch East Indies. Each of these ships is currently on its way back to Japan. Regarding the United States and Panama, it is also being considered to send Ryuta Maru.

Number of Evacuees

Approximately more than 10,000 Japanese residents will return home from various places. Regarding their employment after returning home, the relevant provinces are mediating and researching protection and relief measures. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also decided to send personnel to various places when Japanese residents evacuate, return home, and arrive at Suma Beach in Kobe to cooperate with local officials to provide care and facilitate everything. For those who lack travel expenses or funds, all food, accommodation, and return home expenses will be borne by the Japanese authorities in order to provide comprehensive protection.

### Loford Appointed Director of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau

After Lordford, Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, was transferred from office on the 23rd of this month, he has been appointed Director of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau by the Inspectorate General of Customs. Mr. Lordford will rest for a few days and will take office at the bureau next week. There will be no changes to other personnel in the bureau.

Construction Ship Crew Appeals for Resumption of Work

Since the Japanese rented the Construction, a large dredger of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, to Moji, all the crew members have been dismissed by Mr. Maas, an engineer in the dredging department of the bureau. All employees have petitioned the bureau to withdraw the order and maintain the livelihoods of the employees. It is learned that according to the number of dismissals proposed by Mr. Maas, the first batch will be 36 people. Zhu Mujin and Zhang Along, who were once captured by the Japanese, have been released for a short time and are also on the list of dismissals. Lu Xianhua had previously asked the bureau for leave due to illness and is also on the list of dismissals. This has caused unease among all Chinese employees, especially Mr. Maas's arbitrary and unreasonable dismissals, which are very indignant. According to the bureau's regulations, employees can serve until the age of 60 if there is no fault. On the 28th of last month, Mr. Maas verbally notified the employees of the Construction to report to the bureau from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm. Considering that the ship Chang, at that time, was scattered in various homes in Wusong, Gaoqiao, Pudong, etc. due to the Japanese arrest, how could they be gathered in this hasty time? Therefore, it is unfair both in terms of reason and emotion.

### Gasoline Rationing Indefinitely Postponed

It is reported that major gasoline companies have decided to continue the rationing system. The gasoline allocation for December has already been decided, and the applications from various users are currently being reviewed. New gasoline permits will be distributed to users before the end of this month. New car owners are finding it difficult to obtain gasoline permits, so their gasoline supply will likely depend on the "black market." However, an executive from one gasoline company stated that they are determined to do their utmost to meet legitimate needs and prevent speculators from profiting from it. However, when applying for gasoline allocation, users are requested to state their minimum needs, as the company will not supply large quantities of gasoline. Although gasoline tankers arrive from time to time, the quantity imported is limited, so gasoline companies have decided to continue this rationing system indefinitely.

### Shanghai's Trade with Japan Decreases in Output and Input Last Month

According to the Jianghai Customs announcement, Shanghai's trade with Japan in October showed imports of 2,063,000 gold units and exports of 15,412,000 yuan. Compared to September, imports decreased by 2,677,000 gold units, approximately 55%, and exports decreased by 31,336,000 yuan, approximately 67%. The reasons for this are firstly, a shortage of ships, and secondly, a decrease in exports from occupied areas and a reduction in the production of local products. Imports in October were still dominated by raw silk, rayon, and general merchandise. Machinery, seafood, medicinal materials, spices, books, and fuels all decreased. Exports were dominated by coarse grains, which decreased by one-third compared to September. The remaining categories, such as textiles, fibers, leather, seeds, and soybeans, all decreased by percentages ranging from 10% to 70%.

### Murder Case Occurs in the Ya Lu Bookstore; Xu Kaipu Shot in the Head and Killed

Xu Kaipu, a 30-year-old man from Yangzhou, graduated from the Sino-French School on Route Mitterand. He lived with his mother and three younger brothers at No. 10, Lane 3, Guian Lane, Rue Glock, in the French Concession. Two years ago, he worked as a translator for the political department of the French Police, but was dismissed by the police authorities due to an incident. Xu then went to the occupied areas to earn a living. Half a year ago, he returned to Shanghai from the occupied areas and worked in a certain capacity in Hongkou, leaving early and returning late, as was his custom. Recently, Xu suddenly sent his elderly mother and three younger brothers back to their

hometown of Yangzhou,

and sold the house in Guian Lane for 1,500 yuan. Because Xu Kaipu had a friendly relationship with Gao Xingfa, the owner of the Ya Lu Bookstore at No. 48 Rue Glock, he temporarily resided upstairs in the Ya Lu Bookstore. Yesterday afternoon at 4:15 p.m., after returning home, Xu rested for a while and then went downstairs to the Ya Lu Bookstore. He sat at a seat in the northeast corner of the bookstore, concentrating intently, drinking tea, and listening to the storytelling. Suddenly, a man shot him once from behind. The bullet entered the back of his head and exited his left forehead. Xu fell to the ground injured, with blood gushing out like a fountain. Because the injury was in a vital area,

he died instantly.

At the time, the other listeners in the bookstore suddenly heard the gunshot and were extremely frightened. They all rushed out the door to escape, causing great chaos. Upon receiving the report, the French Police immediately dispatched detectives to investigate. However, the murderer had already escaped without a trace. Xu Kaipu's body was sent to the Tairas Road morgue for examination. When Xu was attacked, he was wearing a gray striped wool suit, yellow leather shoes, and white gold-rimmed glasses. The police authorities are currently investigating the reason for Xu's attack.

### Verdict Reached on the Three Perpetrators in the Assassination of Mr. Mamatov

On September 14th, the assassination of Russian businessman Mamatov occurred at the intersection of Rue Lafayette and Lane 252. After being sent to the hospital, Mr. Mamatov mumbled, "Hovannes killed me," and then died of his injuries. Hovannes, a Russian actor and writer, was immediately arrested by the French Police. Hovannes vehemently denied any involvement in the case and even launched a counterattack against the French Police, wanting to reveal something to "clarify the entire event." However, Hovannes never revealed what that was. The other perpetrator, Liu, and Zhang, who hired Liu to commit the assassination, both confessed. Yesterday (the 24th), the verdict was reached. Hovannes was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment for instigating the assassination, Liu was sentenced to long-term imprisonment, and Zhang was sentenced to imprisonment.

### Adulterated Cooking Oil Sold as Pure, Yuan Xiang Sauce Shop Fined

Yuan Mao Sauce Shop at 314 Avenue Edward VII, recently adulterated the cooking oil it sold by adding water, deceiving the public. Subsequently, Zhou Acai, a female servant surnamed Hu at No. 1, Ji'an Lane, Jixiang Street, French Concession, after purchasing this adulterated oil, was unable to exchange it, leading to a dispute. The police were called in and brought Zhou to the Central Police Station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Kang Zengxiang, the facts were verified. He then reported to the First Special Court to prosecute Chai Shangchu and Chai Qingxiang, the persons in charge of Yuan Mao Sauce Shop, for fraud. They had already been summoned once. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce continued the hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunji argued that the defendants' actions made the purchased oil useless and that they were exploiting the public during a time of high prices, which was particularly egregious. He requested that they be severely punished according to the law. After Judge Zhan questioned the matter clearly, he sentenced Chai Qingxiang to a fine of 500 yuan, or imprisonment with three yuan counted as one day. Chai Shangchu was found not guilty.

### Fire on Tiantong Road

At around 11 a.m. yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in a residence at No. 11, Lane 737 (i.e., Tai'an Lane), Tiantong Road, Public Concession. The fire quickly spread through the roof and to the neighboring houses on both sides. Upon learning of this, the Central Fire Brigade immediately dispatched fire trucks to extinguish the fire.

### Time Bomb Explodes in the San He Lou Restaurant; Two Men Sent in and Fled, Fortunately No One Injured; A Total of Three Bomb Incidents Occurred Yesterday

At around 8 p.m. last night, two men in Western suits went to the San He Lou Tianjin Cuisine Restaurant at No. 30 Avenue Edward VII, opposite the Great World, for dinner in the snack section. After sitting down, they placed a square paper package on table number seven, sat for a short while, and then the two men made excuses to leave one after the other, fleeing without a trace. At that time, there were many diners in the snack section, and the waiters were extremely busy. They did not pay attention to the two men slipping out or the package on the table. Unexpectedly, the package on the table turned out to be a small time bomb. Ten minutes after the two men left, it suddenly exploded, filling the area with black smoke and flying iron fragments. The explosion was extremely loud. At that time, the diners were all shocked and fled outside in droves. Afterwards, the police dispatched detectives to investigate. Fortunately, no one was injured. It is said that two months ago, a person went to the San He Lou and asked the owner of the restaurant to pay a business fee of 200 yuan for every 1,000 yuan in business. However, there was no result. It is impossible to verify whether this case is related to the demand for payment of the business fee.

Heji Earth Goods Store, located at No. 580 Fujian Road, Public Concession, is opened by Shen Yucheng, a person from Pudong. Recently, due to poor business, he rented out part of the store to others to open a firewood shop. At around 7 a.m. yesterday morning, three men suddenly came, carrying a paper package, placed it on the counter of the firewood shop, and said to the old servant, Xu Asan, from Jiading, "Please ask your boss, Zhou, to come out." Before he could finish speaking, one of the two smoke bombs hidden in the package exploded, filling the air with thick smoke. Seeing that the matter was exposed, the three men quickly fled out of the store. The patrol officers who were called in arrived and arrested the three men. According to their confession, they were hired by someone to deliver it, and the rest of the confession was evasive. Also, at around 7 a.m. yesterday morning, when someone was dumping garbage inside Lane 28, Rue Pichon, two hand grenades were found in the garbage can. They immediately reported this to the clerk, who reported it to the French Police, who took the grenades away. It is reported that the two grenades were wooden-handled. The police have already begun investigating the source.

### Assassination in Hongkou Yesterday; Japanese Businessman Shot; Kimura Masakazu Shot in the Back and Abdomen; Japanese Side Searches for the Murderer Without Success

Yesterday morning, another shooting of a Japanese person occurred in Hongkou. Afterwards, the Japanese side dispatched a team to conduct a thorough search at the scene of the incident, and then quickly expanded the search area. Areas such as the Zhabei Railway Station, which is adjacent to Hongkou, were also subjected to a strict search, but no suspects were found. However, the bridges across the Suzhou Creek were not closed off. Kimura Masakazu, a 29-year-old Japanese man and employee of a Japanese cotton mill in Hongkou, was wearing Western-style clothes and was on his way from home to work at around 7 a.m. yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, as he walked to the corner of Huasheng Road and Kunming Road, a man suddenly jumped out from the side of the road. Without asking any questions, he pulled out a pistol and fired two shots (some say four shots) at Kimura's back. At that time, one bullet penetrated Kimura's back and entered his abdomen without exiting. The other bullet hit his shoulder. He immediately collapsed into a pool of blood. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the gunman immediately turned around and fled without a trace. Soon after, the Japanese side received the news and rushed to send the injured person to the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road. It is reported that the injuries are very serious, and his life may be in danger. The case is currently under investigation.

### Report on the Findings of the Central Geological Survey Exploration Team; Northward to the Banks of the Yellow River, Entering Shaanxi and Turning to Gansu, Discovering Dragon Bones and Dinosaur Footprints, etc.

(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Central Geological Survey has newly formed many exploration teams this year, which have gone to Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xikang, Guiyang, and other places to conduct investigations and have made considerable gains. The following is a separate record. The Northwest Sichuan Exploration Team, led by Hui Shiying and Xiong Yongxian as the main and deputy team leaders, respectively, led a team of four members to inspect the grasslands west of Songpan. They departed from Beibei on March 1st. As of now, it has been eight months. They have been as far north as the border between Sichuan and Gansu, on the banks of the Yellow River, and as far west as the He Luo. The area south to Matang is a grassland plateau 3,200 meters above sea level, which is virgin territory in terms of scientific study. This trip discovered the watershed between the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, with gravel on the riverbed. From this, it can be inferred that the capture phenomenon of the rivers is a significant contribution. In terms of mineral resources, placer gold and peat were found in many places. The climate is bitterly cold, with only spring and winter. The growing season for crops is at most only 90 days. Although there is good soil quality, it is limited by the climate, and the prospect of agricultural reclamation is not very promising. The Upper Jialing River Exploration Team, led by Yang Zhongjian and four others, walked along the Jialing River into Shaanxi and turned to Gansu. They successively discovered many dragon bone producing areas in Baoji, Paiyang, Longxian, Tianshui, Chengxian, and other places, and collected three dinosaur footprints, which can be called treasures. Currently, Mr. Yang has returned to the institute in Beibei to begin studying his findings. Huang Jiqing and four others went to northern Gansu in September to thoroughly survey the oil mines. The first phase of the work can be completed within the year. When Mr. Huang went to Gansu, Ma Rongzhi and Lu Zhaoxia of the institute accompanied him to Lanzhou and have transferred to Qinghai. Currently, the eastern part of the province is being investigated for soil and geology. Next spring, they will go to the Qaidam Basin for exploration. It is expected that there will be great prospects. In addition, there are several survey teams in Kang, Qian, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and other provinces. All the work is in progress.

### Visiting Ding Guangxie's Painting Exhibition; The Painting Exhibition is Scheduled to Close Tonight

— Pan Yinge

Tang Bohu's hometown - Suzhou, is a breeding ground for literary and artistic talents. Since the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, all literature, painting, and music have flourished in our county. Music, such as Kunqu opera, its origin and evolution, are all in Suzhou. Literature goes without saying. Painting is also considered to be dominated by talents from Suzhou. After hundreds of years, although circumstances have changed, the trend has not subsided. Yesterday, I went to the Daxin Painting Hall to see Mr. Ding Guangxie's landscape paintings. Although his painting methods are the same as ordinary oil paintings, ordinary oil paintings are still good to look at, but if you look at them from two or three feet away, you will find them crude and unsightly. However, Mr. Ding's paintings are different. His brushstrokes are extremely fine, his color matching is extremely uniform, and his colors are extremely bright, almost forming a whole with natural scenery. The mountains and rivers of our Suzhou are always clear and beautiful, and there are beautiful scenery everywhere. Mr. Ding depicts them using Western methods, and his artistic conception and brushstrokes are no different from Tang Ziwei. Tang Bohu's landscape paintings also use extremely elaborate brushstrokes. When painting flowing water, you can see the ripples. When painting ancient pines, you can see the fine needles. Now Mr. Ding's Western paintings truly have the legacy of the sages of the village. After viewing them, I can't help but feel very admired. I once said that the most intelligent can rejoice in all the natural sounds and compose them into musical movements. The most discerning can appreciate all the natural lines and colors and transmit them into paintings. Mr. Ding is probably the enlightened one among those who have left their homeland. I often love to recite the poems of Lin Hejing of the Song Dynasty, in which there are natural landscapes and the artistic conception of creation can be discovered. Today, looking at Ding's paintings, it is like reading Lin's poems. It can make people forget everything and only see the beauty of nature. The painting exhibition closes tonight. Social ladies and gentlemen, why not go and visit?

However, because the original school building is insufficient for use, it is publicly soliciting several branch school locations. Classrooms, no matter how many, are welcome. If any schools in this city have classrooms available for rent from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., please inform the school by letter and a representative will be sent to discuss it in person.

### Announcement of This Week's Schedule for the University and Middle School Football League

The schedule for this week's University and Middle School Mini-Football League, organized by Aurora University, has been announced.

Some players are wasting water by washing with it. All players should be cautious. Players who are injured or need medicine can obtain supplies from Mr. Lei Shude, the league secretary. This week's schedule is recorded below:

### Gold Price Drops 5,000 Yuan in Five Days; Drops 1,000 Yuan Per Day; Nearly 10,000 Yuan Away from the Highest Price

Yesterday, the spot gold market experienced an unprecedented drop, and although the downward trend has not ceased, it has turned into a fluctuating situation. After breaking the 14,000 yuan mark twice, it rebounded.  The psychology of all parties has changed from fatigue to stability, due to the withdrawal of the American warship Yangtze River and rumors of a partial agreement between the United States and Japan. Therefore, securities firms emerged with 1,000 taels, and Shun Yuan, Yi Feng, and Cheng Ji each released 400-500 taels. It once retreated wildly from 15,350 yuan to 13,400 yuan.  At noon, rumors of bullish buying emerged, and gangs from Hong Kong and Chaozhou covered their short positions. Ming Feng advanced more than 500 taels. Shi He, Xiang Xing Yong, Xiang He, Tong Kang, Yong Ji, and banking groups entrusted securities firms to advance around 300 taels each. Later, the price fluctuated around 14,000 yuan, eventually settling down by a small 470 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was around 24,000 taels.

Spot Prices Fluctuate Nearly 2,000 Yuan

The market opened at 9:00 AM at 15,100 yuan per bar (ten taels), 150 yuan higher than the closing price the previous night. Shi He, Xin Feng Yong, and remittance merchants came in to push up the price, raising it to 350 yuan. Soon, Shun Yuan and others suddenly dumped their holdings, causing a sell-off of nearly 1,000 yuan, dropping the price to 14,350 yuan. Xiang Xing Yong, Ming Feng, and remittance merchants advanced to raise the price by 500 yuan, reaching 14,850 yuan. With news of the Yangtze River warship's withdrawal, the selling pressure rose again. Remittance merchants returned, and Shun Yuan and Li Tai sold large quantities, intensifying the downward trend, and plunging another 1,450 yuan, dropping to 13,400 yuan. At noon, rumors of a partial compromise between the United States and Japan surfaced, and market sentiment turned firm. Xiang Xing Yong and Tian Yuan bought in, causing a rebound, rising 950 yuan. The market closed at noon, rising to 14,350 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, rising 450 yuan amidst the upward trend, reaching 14,800 yuan. Gong He and De Cheng advanced, rising to 14,950 yuan. It then fell again. Tian Yuan and Gong He sold heavily, plunging 1,200 yuan, dropping to 13,750 yuan. Finally, Ming Feng and remittance merchants vigorously advanced, pushing the price up by 730 yuan. The market closed at 4:00 PM at 14,480 yuan, a further small decrease of 470 yuan compared to the previous day. It has been decreasing for five consecutive days, with a total drop of 5,050 yuan. The daily difference was 1,950 yuan. After the close, the price rose to 14,800 yuan. The marked price of gold shops was 15,000 yuan, selling 1,000 yuan lower.

Ornamental Gold and Silver Prices Both Fall

The selling price of ornamental gold per tael in silver shops, Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, initially decreased three times, dropping 130 yuan, to 1,400 yuan. At noon, it rebounded 70 yuan, and in the afternoon, it rose another 50 yuan, reaching 1,520 yuan, then suddenly fell to 1,450 yuan, and rebounded three times, rising 50 yuan, totaling 1,500 yuan (decreasing 150 yuan when taken in), still falling by a small 30 yuan. Fine silver was down 2 yuan, to 22 yuan, and the black market was down 1 yuan, totaling 17 yuan.

### Black Market Exchange Rate Plunges; US Dollar Once Reaches 26 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: the official rates of the Central Bank and HSBC did not change. The small counters of 14 foreign banks, including British and American banks, maintained stable prices. The black market exchange rates for British and American currencies first plunged and then rebounded slightly, due to initial news of the withdrawal of the American Yangtze River Fleet, followed by rumors of a partial compromise between the United States and Japan. After the market opened in the morning, spot gold plunged, and the price of the US dollar fell to 25-26 yuan. Speculators sought to liquidate their remaining long positions, leading to a sudden drop. Banque de l'Indochine sold US$5,000-6,000 to a French import firm at a price of 3.75 yuan, and later it became even firmer, with no sellers at that price. HSBC offered to sell at 2s4 3/8d, and the decline stopped slightly at noon. Although no further transactions took place in the afternoon, the market softened slightly. The closing prices were 2s4 3/8d for the British pound and 3.625 yuan for the US dollar, an increase of 1/8d for the former and 2.5 yuan for the latter compared to the previous day.

Yesterday's foreign currency market conditions: the prices of British and American gold pounds each fell by 10 yuan. The price of British gold notes gradually stabilized, while the price of American gold notes once fell to 26 yuan, finally settling at 27.20 yuan, a decrease of 1.90 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of Hong Kong notes fell and then rebounded to par. The prices of Japanese and Korean gold notes both trended lower, with the former falling to 2.70 yuan and the latter dropping to 2.90 yuan.

Tianjin, 25th (Tuesday) Dispatch: This morning, the market opened flat. There were no changes in the London and New York telegraphic transfer rates. There were quotes but no market. The black market for "Joint Notes" also showed little fluctuation. The Shanghai exchange rate alone rose by 3.50 yuan, to 77.50 yuan.

Hong Kong, 25th (Tuesday) Dispatch: The foreign exchange market opened steadily this morning. There were no gains or losses in the trading of various currencies.

### List of Bank Holidays for Next Year

A Glimpse into the Dynamics of the Banking Industry

In addition to Saturday afternoon closures and Sunday holidays, the following are the holidays for the Shanghai banking industry in the Republic of China Year 31: New Year's Day, January 1st, 2nd, and 3rd (Thursday, Friday, Saturday); Spring Festival, February 16th, 17th, and 18th (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday); Tomb Sweeping Day, April 3rd, 4th, and 6th (Friday, Saturday, Monday); Summer Vacation, June 18th (Thursday); Mid-Year Settlement, July 2nd and 3rd (Thursday); Confucius' Birthday Commemoration, August 27th (Thursday); Autumn Festival, September 24th (Thursday); National Day, October 10th (Saturday); Sun Yat-sen's Birthday Commemoration, November 12th (Thursday); Yunnan Uprising Commemoration, December 25th (Friday).

Among the holidays listed above, most fall on Thursdays, followed by Fridays and Saturdays. This is quite coincidental.

Zi Kang Zhuang joined the money exchange as a member on November 21st. From the 26th, each bank will accept payment notes from the Zhuang and entrust the Silver Union Association to collect them on its behalf, in the same manner as other member Zhuang.

Some silver and money exchange firms in the city have been adding 2 yuan in overdue interest since October, presumably to subsidize employees. However, this has not yet been confirmed.

### As the Situation Shifts, Foreign Debt Soars; Category D Stands Out

London, 20th (Monday) Dispatch: Today's market quotes for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks showed increases in Chinese debt notes. The previous tranche of the Anglo-German Continuation Loan (British Issue) and the Vickers Aircraft Loan each rose by £3, the former to £50 and the latter to £14. The Crisp Loan rose by £2.5, to £32. The Anglo-French Loan (British Issue) and the Reorganization Loan (British Issue) each rose by £2, the former to £48 and the latter to £38.5. Post-tranche railway bonds showed sharp increases, with the Beining rising sharply by £5, to £70; the Daocheng rising by £4, to £17; and the Hukuang (Non-German Issue) rising by £3, to £18. The Jinghu rose by £1, also to £18. The remaining bonds each rose by £2, all to £15. Among British company stocks, bank stocks mostly showed improvement, with Mercantile Bank rising by 2s 6d, to £9 7s 6d; HSBC (London Registered Shares) rising by £3, to £80; and HSBC (Hong Kong Registered Shares) rising by £1, to £86. Jardine Matheson also rose by 2s 6d, to £12 12s 6d. Only the Kailan Mining Administration shares fell by 6d, to 13s 6d. There were no other changes.

In the black market for public bonds, the market was slightly sluggish yesterday. Prices failed to break through the previous day's closing prices. In the afternoon, the price even broke through 70 yuan. Rumors were mixed, mostly bearish. Many long positions were liquidated, and some even switched from long to short. The general floating long positions showed a reluctance to compete. However, Category D stood out, possibly due to its lower speculative nature. The temporary trend may be small first and then large. In short, the negotiations between the United States and Japan will still be the deciding factor. Yesterday morning, Category C opened at 70 yuan and 6 jiao. From then on, the market gradually weakened. Multiple long positions were liquidated by Tong Yi and Ren Feng. Jiu Feng also sold. Tong Kang and Yi Zhong slightly replenished their positions. The market closed slightly lower by 2-3 jiao at noon. In the afternoon, Tong Yi continued to sell. Heng Kang, Ding Kang, and Sheng Da all sold. Sheng Xing seemed to have switched from long to short. Yi Tai also sold. The selling pressure in the market was heavy. Category C broke through 70 yuan, seeing a small price of 69 yuan and 7 jiao. Jiu Feng replenished its position. Lian He, Lian Yi, and Xie Xing Yuan slightly bought in. It then rebounded to above 70 yuan. The closing price resulted in a decrease of 3-6.5 jiao for various categories, except for Category D, which rose by 3 jiao. The trading volume was approximately 1.5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Stock Trading Transactions: 100 shares of China National Products Company, priced at 75 yuan per share.

The stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce fluctuated greatly. The waves were particularly large throughout the day. It initially showed a stable trend in the morning, but then gradually trended downward. The noon close rebounded slightly. The afternoon trend was similar to the morning: initially rising and then falling. At the close, the prices partially recovered. As a result, although the prices of various stocks were significantly lower than the previous close, there were no signs of panic in the market.

### Gold Prices Rise and Fall Suddenly; "Double Horse" Yarn Follows Closely

Recently, the yarn market has been fluctuating wildly, with a wide range of ups and downs. This is due to the dramatic changes in gold prices, as well as the uncertain nature of the US-Japan negotiations, which unsettles speculators. The yarn market follows, with turbulent waves. However, actual transactions, of course, have been cut off since the ban. However, due to the blocked source of raw materials, the factory's production is bound to decrease. The highest price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 2,565 yuan, and the low price was 2,380 yuan. After the afternoon opening, the price jumped wildly with the remaining price, to 2,560 yuan. Upon seeing the high price, those who had made profits sold out, and it loosened again to 2,440 yuan. However, there were large buyers, gradually rebounding to 2,525 yuan. The closing price was 1,515 yuan, and the market price was 2,520 yuan.

The "Double Horse" yarn market opened stably in the morning. The opening price was 2,530 yuan, and it soon rose to 2,565 yuan. However, there were slight sell-offs on the table at this high price. It hovered around 2,520-2,530 yuan for quite some time. Unexpectedly, a gold storm suddenly arose, and the downward trend was fierce. People's hearts were drawn into the vortex, and the selling pressure was strong. With claims that the atmosphere for peace was extremely strong, short sellers were very active. The market gradually opened and gradually declined, loosening straight to the low peak of 2,380 yuan. As it approached 12:00, the gold market suddenly rebounded, and the buying pressure in the yarn market followed, gradually rising to a closing price of 2,490 yuan. According to statistics, 3,400 bales were traded in half a day. Today, 60 pieces of Japanese yarn were transferred to Tianjin.

The gold and "Double Horse" futures market, in a volatile and slightly stable situation, continued to decline, with a complex mixture of gains and losses. The general public, whether long or short, had no ability to hold positions for long. In particular, the potential of sellers was such that whenever the trend softened, a major sell-off occurred. Therefore, the market was largely characterized by an easy-to-fall and difficult-to-rise trend. At the initial opening in the morning, the firm rise in factory orders led to an upstream buying pressure. The December contract opened at 2,580 yuan, a large increase of 80 yuan. However, rumors abounded, mostly bearish. Many long positions fluctuated, and the futures price fell sharply. The near-term once decreased to 2,410 yuan, with the January contract also decreasing to 2,415 yuan and the February contract also decreasing to 2,480 yuan. By the noon close, it gradually rose, with each month's futures only decreasing by 30-50 yuan. In the afternoon, it was still firm first and then weak, with the situation being relatively stable. Due to the buying of floating short positions and retail investors, the December contract closed at 2,470 yuan, down 30 yuan; the January contract closed at 2,525 yuan, down 35 yuan; and the February contract closed at 2,570 yuan, also down 45 yuan.

### Cotton Market Stalls

The current cotton situation is hindered by rumors, and transactions have come to a standstill. This is due to the repeated decline in margin and yarn prices. In addition, factories are silent and inactive, and can only remain in a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, although there are slight intentions to sell at a discount, there are no buyers. As a result, no transactions were heard of throughout the day. It is faintly heard that fine velvet is still unwilling to fall significantly, but the price of group velvet has already become inferior.

### Eastern Cloth Sales are Hopeless

The Dongbu Stock Exchange's colored ball futures market opened steadily, but the market declined in the later session. The December closing price was 86.5 yuan, a decrease of 1.99 yuan. The January closing price was 89 yuan, a decrease of 2.5 yuan. However, the spot market, due to hopeless real sales, became increasingly loose. The opening price for the leading fine cloth factory orders was 93-94 yuan, but it fell all the way down to 89 yuan at the noon close. In the later session, it was heard that yarn prices had risen, rebounding to 91 yuan at the close, but it was still 3.5 yuan lower than the previous day. The Four Gentlemen serge opened at 3.4 yuan, fell to 3.24 yuan, and the final closing price was 3.33 yuan.

### Foreign Flour and Edible Oil are Both Seeking to Sell; the Coarse Grain Market is Reorganized

There were few transactions of foreign flour in the early market, and influenced by the sluggishness of the previous night and the rice market, those with floating profits were all seeking to sell. Due to the lack of strong demand from merchants, the Eastern pier's transshipment flour formally opened lower at 48 yuan. Later, some practical sales took advantage of the low price, adding half a yuan, to 48.5 yuan. With the practical sales consultant from the Western pier, the price also ranged from 37 to 38 yuan. The market generally showed a stable trend. There was also a lack of movement in bran and wheat. Today, 9,500 bags of flour packaged on the new Beijing ship were transferred to Tianjin.

The Coarse Grain and Oil Cake market was taken over by the reorganized Coarse Grain Association yesterday afternoon. Therefore, there were only morning transactions, and few transactions took place in the afternoon. Due to active selling by scattered hoarders, edible oil prices fell by 5 to 10 yuan. Feidou also fell by 3-4 yuan due to loose selling in the goods. Corn remained relatively stable. In total, 30 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 300 dan of Qingyou from the Dayou factory, 100 dan of rapeseed oil, 100 barrels of rapeseed oil from the Taishan factory, 70 barrels of rapeseed oil from the Rihua factory, more than 600 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan, 200 bags of green beans, and 500 bags of spot corn were sold. The futures volume was more than 100 tons. Regarding arrivals, the French company's Los Angeles ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, transporting 1,634 tons of corn from Haiphong, totaling 16,500 bags, which were unloaded at the Shun Tai Wharf in Hongkou.

With no market for foreign rice, and with talk of a limited price of 150 yuan for domestic rice, buyers are hesitant, and the market has completely stalled again.

### Sugar Futures Fall to the Limit and Rise to the Limit in One Day

Yesterday, the sugar market initially fell due to the peaceful atmosphere and the decline in spot gold and cotton yarn. Therefore, futures and spot raw white sugar both fell into the 200 yuan range. Due to the limit down in raw sugar futures, and with the sudden news in the afternoon that Dutch ships would reduce their voyages to the Far East, prices rebounded. The highest and lowest fluctuations differed by more than 30 yuan, showing how extreme the fluctuations were. The company's raw sugar futures for the end of the month fell to 187 yuan in the morning, and the December 10th contract fell to 199 yuan, both hitting the limit down. The black market price was 177 yuan to 187 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the rumor of Dutch ships reducing their voyages to the Far East, the contract for the end of this month rose to 190 yuan and 197 yuan, also hitting the limit up. The December 10th contract was initially 187 yuan in the afternoon, then rose to 214 yuan to 219 yuan, also hitting the limit up. The subsequent black market prices were 200 yuan to 193 yuan, and 210 yuan. For spot goods, the November import of 24 grade raw white sugar was 209 yuan, 200 yuan, and 190 yuan in the morning, and 196 yuan, 209 yuan, and 6 yuan in the afternoon. The October goods were 208 yuan, 200 yuan, and 189 yuan in the morning, and 195 yuan in the afternoon.

### The Problem of Female Employees

— Pingye

The intermittent news about the postal service suspending female employees has been published for almost a year. Because of the distance and barriers, we are still ashamed that we have not been able to fully understand the real reason for this move. When the examination and appointment of female employees was suspended, the women's community asked the Directorate General of Posts to explain the reasons. The Directorate General of Posts made a statement saying that married female employees are inconvenient to travel over mountains and rivers, so the examination and appointment were suspended (something to that effect; I have not seen the original text). Recently, at a meeting of the National参政会, there was the following news: "Female参政员 Chen Yiyun questioned why the postal service was discriminating against female employees and suspending the employment of married female employees, and said that this move was inconsistent with the meaning of increasing the population. Kong Geng also said that if married female employees were suspended, it would be inhumane. In fact, it can only restrict female employees from getting married, but it cannot restrict female employees from falling in love, and remedies should be sought." The words of Chen and Kong are directed at reality and have a common ground. Their straightforwardness also has its facts.

When men talk about women's rights, it is the same as when women talk about men's rights. If you are not thinking about the other party's rights, it is better to remain silent. Freedom is freedom insofar as it does not infringe on the freedom of others, and equality is equality insofar as it does not infringe on the equality of others. I don't want to say anything about the right and wrong of this issue. I only want to examine the reasons for this issue. As for the conclusion, I am waiting for the era to make its fair judgment!

Perhaps what the post office says about married female employees not being able to endure the journey is not just referring to their physical fitness, because physical fitness must be checked. I think what they are referring to is that if married female employees become pregnant, they will have the suffering of not being able to endure the journey. This statement has not been seen in the fragmented news. I am just assuming this. If this is the meaning, I acknowledge that it has its difficulties, but this is accidental. At least the局方's explanation is not sufficient.

As for the women's community, striving for equality is of course beyond reproach, but it would be best if married female employees can absolutely have no problem with the局方's transfers. Otherwise, they should find a way to solve this factual difficulty of the局方.

We have also seen female employees serving in any public institution in the past, and some have achieved good results, while others inevitably have the label of "vase". However, in this great era, women's bravery has its unique manifestations. This past perception of "vase" should be discarded. In order to strive for true gender equality, women should seek equality in service and equality in treatment through equality in knowledge and equality in education.

The post office may not permanently refuse to employ married female employees, and married female employees may not regard whether or not they are employed by the post office as an honor or disgrace. Moreover, the post office's suspension of the employment of married female employees is not a fundamental issue of gender equality, but only a temporary factual issue. We look forward to an early resolution.

### Amidst Calls for Expanded Price Controls, Earnestly Hoping for Sanctions Against the Rampant "House Weevils"

— Cao Wenhai

Now that the authorities of the two concessions have demonstrated their determination to implement their policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices, they certainly will not be satisfied with what has been achieved so far. Millions of citizens in Shanghai are also earnestly hoping that the authorities, adhering to the principle of protecting the populace and maintaining public order, will provide the citizens with full assistance and order the "house weevils" (large landlords and sub-landlords) to voluntarily reduce rents.

A large landlord has intensified his oppression of tenants. My close friend, Mr. Zhao, rented a dilapidated double-structure residence on Rue Gallieni in the French Concession before the war. The "house weevil" is a Ningbo native who started in the construction industry. At that time, both parties agreed that the monthly rent would be seventy yuan, and the landlord would be responsible for repairing any damage to the house. In the first year or two after moving in, there was one repair. However, after the August 13th Incident, in the summer of the following year, the roof was damaged and leaking, and several walls were also on the verge of collapse. He sent a letter to the landlord requesting repairs, but received no response. Not only did the landlord not instruct a mason to repair the building, but in mid-January, he suddenly received a lawyer's letter demanding a 30% increase in rent per month. If Mr. Zhao did not agree to the increase, he would be required to terminate the lease and move out by the end of the year. Mr. Zhao had no way to argue and had to agree to the increase. Unexpectedly, after the rent increase, the landlord still did not instruct craftsmen to repair the leaks, and less than three months later, at the beginning of [Year Omitted] eighteen, he received another letter from the rental agent demanding an increase in water fees of twelve yuan per building. Subsequently, letters arrived one after another, demanding either an increase in rent or an increase in water fees, and even threatening to stop the water supply, forcing the tenants to install their own water meters and bear the water costs themselves. After several negotiations, this was dropped. However, in early spring of this year, due to the excessive damage to the roof, he notified the landlord to instruct craftsmen to repair the house. The rental agent replied in a letter saying that all repairs were the responsibility of the tenants themselves. Unexpectedly, in mid-June, the rental agent sent another letter saying: "The land price in this city is rising daily, and all expenses attached to the lease, as well as various taxes, are constantly increasing. We have no choice but to increase the rent by 50% from July 1st, and charge an additional ten yuan per building per month for tap water." They also added: "If your tenants ignore the water fee portion before the 10th of the month, the agency will no longer be responsible for paying the water fee in the future. In the event of water cuts or other accidents, we will not be liable." The oppression of tenants by large landlords has intensified to this extreme. I am afraid that Mr. Zhao is not the only one among the millions of citizens in Shanghai.

There are countless sub-landlords who take advantage of the situation, adding to the suffering of Shanghai citizens by subletting houses for a living. In these extraordinary times, they spare no effort in exploiting the sub-tenants (i.e., lodgers). Before, renting a single-structure house cost forty or fifty yuan, and a double-structure house cost only sixty or seventy yuan. They partition the houses, build lofts, and create spaces resembling pigeon coops, and then sublet them to third-level tenants. A厢房 (side room) rents for one hundred and twenty yuan, a 客堂樓 (living room upstairs) rents for eighty or ninety yuan, a 亭子間 (small room) rents for forty or fifty yuan, and the rents for the upper lofts, third-level lofts, and 灶披間 (kitchen shed) altogether amount to around four hundred yuan. After deducting monthly expenses of around one hundred yuan for rent, house tax, and utility bills, excluding the self-use of the living room, sun deck, and 亭子間, they can still net a profit of over two hundred yuan, reaping benefits without any effort. If the large landlord increases the rent, for example, by 10%, the "house weevil" will increase the rent for the "lodgers" by 30%. Even those who are more reasonable will increase it by 10%. However, the 10% increase for the large landlord is only seven yuan, while the increase for the "lodgers" by the sub-landlord is perhaps thirty or forty yuan. Moreover, with the increase in water, electricity, and tax expenses, the "house weevils" take the opportunity to arbitrarily increase them, creating an extra source of income. Countless third-level tenants are forced to move out because they cannot afford the exorbitant rents. There are also some cunning "house weevils" who use houses as tools for extortion, plastering the entrances of lanes with red slips advertising rentals and sublets, luring those looking for houses into their trap. They require a deposit of half or two-thirds of the rent in advance, and then discuss the terms of the lease. If the prospective tenant does not agree, the deposit is confiscated. Even if the matter is negotiated and the deposit is returned, only three or four-tenths of it is returned.

In the past four or five years, the rampant, tyrannical, and oppressive behavior of Shanghai's "house weevils," who are causing suffering to their fellow citizens, is no less than that of the "rice tigers." This is intolerable. It is earnestly hoped that the authorities of the two concessions will rescue the "lodgers" from the depths of misery and allow them to live in peace. This is a matter of utmost urgency. However, I must also earnestly advise those who are "lodgers" that Shanghai is a place where people from all over come together, and there are both good and bad people. Not all "sub-landlords" are lawless. Matters must be discussed fairly. However, there are also some third-level tenants who are excessive, such as deliberately owing rent, leaving the lights on all night, ironing clothes privately, and using several basins of clean water to wash a single towel. These behaviors must also be improved. (Editor's Note: Rent arrears are now extremely rare. Most "landlords" turn off the main power switch at night, which poses a great danger in terms of preventing theft, fire, and water damage. It is hoped that the authorities will pay close attention to this.)

### A Call to Suppress House Rents

Mr. Editor: I read a letter from Mr. Li Zhenzhi in the "Chunqiu" column on the 19th and felt the same pain. I am not alone in this feeling; I am afraid that 99% of all tenants in Shanghai share this sentiment. Compatriots who have come to Shanghai to seek refuge from the suffering of the occupied areas are all making temporary plans, hoping to prolong their lives a little. Compatriots who originally resided in Shanghai and held property rights or lease rights should, in this time of national crisis, help those in need and fulfill their duties as citizens. Instead, they are taking advantage of the opportunity to profit, extorting in every possible way, and making a fortune off the national crisis, which is truly unforgivable. Especially the sub-landlords, who rent houses for only thirty or forty yuan to one hundred yuan per building per month, rent out a living room for one or two hundred yuan, and a 亭子間 for fifty or sixty yuan. This is shocking and against the law. All tenants in Shanghai should unite and appeal to the authorities to set limits on house prices so that the evil landlords can no longer exploit us. This is the best course of action. Otherwise, it will be in vain. ... Respectfully,

Yours sincerely, Su Yuebo

A certain sub-landlord purchased a coffin four years ago for eighty-seven yuan. It now sells for one thousand two hundred and forty yuan, making it one thousand one hundred and fifty-three yuan cheaper. The sub-landlord was overjoyed. However, considering that renting out the space occupied by the coffin could yield thirty yuan per month, totaling one thousand four hundred and forty yuan over four years, the sub-landlord would actually lose two hundred and eighty-seven yuan. The sub-landlord couldn't help but turn from laughter to tears.

### Begonia

Fourteen - The Life of a Street Performer

Begonia, holding two pieces of rock candy, stood behind the fourth person, his heart pounding unexpectedly. His cough persisted, and the rock candy had failed to work its usual magic.

He began to worry that his physical strength might not be up to the task today.

When it was his turn to go out, he originally wanted to take a few more steps and then do a somersault, which would save him some energy. Unexpectedly, he panicked and his mind went blank. As soon as he went out, he used too much force, and his body flipped two or three feet high. When he landed, everything immediately turned black, and he suddenly tasted a sweetness on the root of his tongue that he had never experienced before. Then he fainted.

He didn't know how they helped him off the stage, or how they sent him home and laid him on the couch like a dead man. All he knew was that when he opened his weary eyes again, he saw Mei Bao standing in front of the bed, crying like a river, holding a bowl of medicine in her right hand, shaking more violently than someone with malaria.

"Ah!" He sighed without a sound. (272) (End of Chapter 14)

### Shanghai Also Watches "Foggy Chongqing"

— Tan Sui

Before the Shanghai Drama Art Society could perform it, the Huaguang Drama Art School took the lead and premiered "Foggy Chongqing" at the Russian Art Theatre.

The plot, from beginning to end, constantly lingered in a solemn atmosphere. Whether it was the little hotel in the second act or the lavish life in the villa in the third act, it was all the same. This is a well-known fact to the public in the face of the times. The playwright was indeed able to hold the attention of the general audience, and especially because it contained a profound sense of condemnation, it made the audience deeply feel it in the unspoken explanations.

The fall of Sha Zhanxiong, the death of Old He, the confusion of Lin Shulan, Hu Huiling's role as a physiognomist, Lu Min's unwillingness to be a primary school teacher, and Xu Manli's dishonorable life - were these all out of their own free will? No, they all wanted to have their proper lives and proper futures, but because they were all driven to struggle on the brink of starvation and were eager to find a way out, they all inevitably went down the wrong path. Only Lu Min and Old He were exceptions.

In this performance, the personalities of the actors were very suitable for the characters in the play. The dialogue and actions were just right, except that the female lead, Lin Shulan, spoke too fast when she spoke quickly, and too slowly when she spoke slowly, and the male lead, Sha Zhanxiong, spoke a little too softly. But what I found most lovable and pitiable was Mr. Lu Min, who was first a waiter, then a primary school teacher, and later introduced to Sha Zhanxiong as a servant by his wife. He never wanted to change his scholarly nature, that is, he always had to say "firstly," "secondly," and "thirdly" in an essay-like manner. When his wife scolded him: "You go to be a primary school teacher who can't get enough to eat and won't starve to death, tighten your pants and go listlessly to the classroom to mislead the children. It's better to be a servant crisply and cleanly!" Aren't these few sentences enough to move me, a person who also lives off chalk dust?

On the way home on the first night, attacked by the dark and cold wind, I felt that I was coming back with a full "satisfaction."

### Past and Present of Bai Yuwei

— Chang Mei

The actress Bai Yuwei is a graduate of the Peking Opera School. Her appearance, voice, stage presence, and tone are all excellent. During her school days, the Qingyi teacher Wu Fuqin and Lu Peifang taught her Qingyi plays, such as "June Snow," "Mulberry Garden Meeting," "Teaching the Son," and "Wujiapo." Later, she also received personal instruction from Cheng Yanqiu on famous plays such as "Mandarin Duck Tomb" and "Jasper Hairpin," which she performed just like her teacher. After the opera school disbanded, she transferred to the Guanghua Society to help perform charity plays in Tianjin for two months, returning with praise. After returning to Peking, she worked hard and diligently, and further practiced 蹻工 (foot binding dance) and 把子 (stage combat) with famous teachers. She also learned Kunqu from Han Shichang and Hou Yuyou, and Huashan plays from Zhu Ruxiang and Hao Jieqing. She never stopped for a year, and her art made rapid progress. She has repeatedly performed in public with famous actors in Peking, and her reputation has greatly increased. According to friends in Peking, the actress Bai is intelligent by nature, and she is also innocent and lively. In addition to learning opera, she likes to study and try to understand literature. She was especially good at English in elementary school. This time, she will appear in "Chunjin" with Li Shaochun, and it is certain that the red flowers and green leaves will complement each other wonderfully. Both of them are talented in both civil and military arts and are not blocked by Kunqu or other forms of opera.

Chapter 19: At Dusk, the Hu Cavalry Filled the City with Dust

The Ao River was very wide, the river water rippling, the wild wind whistling. There was no moonlight in the sky, only many stars, flickering and shining with faint light. Looking into the distance, the lights on the opposite bank were dense, as if they were heavily guarded. Knowing that as long as there was any movement here, they would immediately intercept from the other side, so they lay still. Seeing the stars change position in the sky, it was already the second half of the night, Zhang Cangqiu suddenly saw several places on the opposite bank emitting white smoke, gradually tongues of fire burst out, the red light reflecting the sky, and the sound of people clamoring. Zhang Cangqiu knew that Xu Jing and others had successfully attacked and that he should go to meet them. Not daring to be careless, he immediately urged Chen Fei to lead his soldiers, build a pontoon bridge, cross the river, and launch a surprise attack. Although there were bandits blocking them, their strength was already scattered. Zhang Cangqiu and others had already strongly crossed the Xiluo River and rushed ashore together. At this time, Xu Jing and Liu Yining were already engaged in a bloody battle on the west bank of the Luo River, which was extremely intense. Because Bai Xianzong received the order from San Gui, he knew that Xu Jing and Liu Yining could be the vanguard, so he summoned the two to his tent, instructed them, and ordered them to lead two thousand people to set off at dusk, detour to the shallow part of the Xiluo River downstream, and launch a surprise attack on the bandits. After the two were ordered to withdraw, Liu Yining smiled at Xu Jing and said: "In the great battle of Yipianshi the other day, Brother Zhang showed his skills on the battlefield, but I was unable to gallop much. This time we have the order to secretly cross the Luo River, and we must achieve our goal. I think Zhang Cangqiu and others will definitely respond at the same time. I want to take this opportunity to kill more bandits." Xu Jing said: "Brother Liu is right. Your skills are no less than Brother Zhang's, and I am willing to follow behind you and kill the bandits together." (228)
