### Turkey Announces Martial Law, Army Chief Inspects Thrace

London, "Exchange Telegraph" reported yesterday from Istanbul that the Turkish High Command has decided to declare martial law within Turkish territory. This action is possibly to facilitate the withdrawal of residents from Adrianople, Rodosto, and most of European Turkey to Anatolia (Asian Turkey). (United Press, 12th)

Istanbul, Turkish Minister of National Defense, Tevfik, arrived in Istanbul from Turkey yesterday, to confer with the Istanbul Garrison Commander on important matters. He will depart for Thrace shortly. (Haitong Telegraph, 12th)

### Prelude to the Balkan War: British and German Forces Clash; Nazi Troops Employ Pincer Movement Strategy, Vanguard Pushing Southward Through Monastir

London, According to sources here, a British armored car unit patrolling the Monastir area yesterday dispersed a unit of enemy infantry. The British side suffered no casualties. (Reuters, 12th)

London, According to a recent Greek communiqué, German troops that infiltrated through the Monastir gap in northern Greece have made contact with Greek forces in the Florina area. (Reuters, 12th)

London, Yesterday, Hungarian forces invaded Yugoslavia, and the German offensive was also very fierce, penetrating the positions held by British and British Empire forces in northern Greece. The outcome of the initial clash between British and German forces is currently unknown. The location of the engagement is not yet disclosed, but it is reported that a Panzer division led by German General List has appeared at the famous Monastir Pass (where Yugoslavia enters Greece). British officials announced that British forces in Greece are under the command of General Wilson and subject to the orders of Greek General Papagos. General Wilson was appointed commander of British forces in Egypt in 1939. He faced significant challenges in defending the western desert border in the months following the fall of France and Italy's entry into the war. From February onward, Wilson commanded British forces in the offensive across Benghazi. Subsequently, Wilson was appointed commander of British forces in Cyrenaica, eastern Libya, and military governor of the province. (10th)

Athens, It was learned here yesterday that German tank columns have broken through the Monastir Gorge on the Yugoslav-Greek border and are advancing towards Florina. British and German forces have made initial contact, commencing the real Greek campaign. According to a Royal Air Force communiqué, despite heavy bombing by the RAF, German forces continue to advance. The communiqué indicates that German forces are preparing to establish contact with key routes in northwestern Greece in order to bypass the rear of the central Greek defense line, employing a pincer movement. Another British official report states that German forces have advanced to Gevgelija and Monastir, while resistance in southern Yugoslavia is growing stronger. The situation in eastern Macedonia is unclear, but Greek resistance is very strong. It is reported that the advance units of British and German forces have only engaged in skirmishes so far. It is believed that such contacts have occurred as the German forces advance from Monastir. Although the initial contact point is in a mountainous and valley area, there are several wide plateaus suitable for large-scale deployment of armored divisions. In addition to penetrating the Monastir Gorge, another German force is advancing westward from Salonica for thirty miles. The central pivot of the British defense line appears to be Edessa, north of Mount Olympus. The greatest German pressure is at the tri-border area of Greece, Albania, and Yugoslavia. The Monastir Gorge is south of Monastir in Yugoslavia. The south end of the pass straddles the border, north of Florina in northwestern Greece. East of Florina, past Lake Vegoritida, is Edessa, and further east towards the south is Salonica. If German forces advancing west from Salonica and those continuing east after occupying Florina (German forces have not yet occupied Florina) can converge, the British-Greek defense line will be pincered by German forces. (Associated Press, 12th)

London, Local newspapers believe that Allied forces have established a main defense line in Greece from Florina to Mount Olympus. The German occupation of Giannitsa, thirty-five miles north of this line, indicates that German reinforcements are strengthening the German forces attacking Florina from Salonica. Because the north-south highway connects directly to the north of Florina, if the British-Greek Allied forces launch a counter-offensive before the German forces on these two roads converge, the Nazi troops in the Monastir Pass will be in a very difficult situation, with only this narrow pass for retreat. British military commentators also pointed out that if German tank forces were dispersed over a wider area, they would be easier to attack. (United Press, 12th)

London, Information received here yesterday evening from Ankara stated that German mechanized units in Salonica are advancing southwest, indicating that the real battle for Greece is about to begin, or has already begun. Observers say that it is very possible that German forces have made contact with British forces, as it was widely reported earlier this week that British forces had concentrated at Katerini, the main Greek military port north of Mount Olympus. At the same time, Greece has admitted that they never intended to defend Salonica. However, if they cannot stop the German advance in Thessaly, the situation will become more complicated. (United Press, 12th)

### The King of Greece Encourages the People to Uphold the Traditional Spirit of the Nation

Athens, King George II broadcast a decree to the nation via wireless radio this morning. It stated, "My brave Greek people, with firm resolve and united hatred of the enemy, you will surely resist the enemy's aggression. We must continue to fight and fulfill our duty to protect the country. The entire nation, both military and civilians, is now united to defend our independence and uphold our traditional heroic spirit. Compatriots, the survival of the nation hangs in the balance. I hope you will not forget our glorious ancestors." (Havas, 12th)

### Yugoslav Forces Launch Fierce Counter-Offensive to Maintain Contact with Greek Forces

London, Yugoslav Premier Simović broadcast from somewhere in Yugoslavia last night, declaring the Yugoslav people's determination to continue resisting aggression. He said that the Yugoslav people were not discouraged by the initial German victories. Although the current situation is difficult, he trusts that the justness of Yugoslavia's cause, the loyalty and bravery of the Yugoslav army, the aid of allied nations, and the Yugoslav people's hatred of the enemy will ensure Yugoslavia's final victory. The Yugoslav army has now concentrated on the main defense line to prevent German forces from penetrating deeper. (Reuters, 12th)

London, The outcome of the Yugoslav counter-offensive is being awaited here, as it is reported that Yugoslav forces are launching a counter-offensive, attempting to recapture Kicevo in order to establish contact with British forces. Military commentators believe that the Yugoslav army has a good chance of success, as the initial offensive of tank forces is the most fierce, but it is not easy to consolidate the captured positions during a rapid advance. In such circumstances, it often makes a single column vulnerable to counter-attack. (United Press, 12th)

London, With the assistance of the Royal Air Force, fresh Yugoslav forces began a large-scale counter-offensive southwest of Prilep in southern Yugoslavia yesterday. German mechanized units moving westward are advancing rapidly to intercept the Yugoslav forces moving south, attempting to gain control of Albania, as the fate of the Italian forces there will depend on this battle. Another report from the northern Albanian front states that Yugoslav forces crossing the Drin River are now northwest of Alessio. German actions are focused on ensuring the safety of the Italian positions in Albania, as those positions are under threat. The Yugoslav army is striving to maintain its retreat route under difficult circumstances in order to join up with the British-Greek forces in southern Albania. German forces are advancing from Peričani on the northeastern border of Albania south to Tetovo, then south to Prilep, with the goal of linking up with Italian forces in Albania. It is also reported that German forces advancing north from Niš are attacking Krushevac, where there is a Yugoslav armaments factory. Authorities there also claimed that German forces had reached the gates of the Yugoslav capital. (United Press, 12th)

Berlin, According to a communiqué issued by the German High Command, German units are advancing into Yugoslavia from several directions. German forces advancing from Niš have defeated enemy resistance after fierce fighting. Resistance in Croatia, Yugoslavia, has collapsed, and the northern army in Serbia has also disintegrated.

Editorial

### Prospects for the Axis Spring Offensive

At the outset of the German military offensive in the Balkans, a Greek spokesman made a statement acknowledging: "The initial German offensive will certainly progress very quickly, because the German army can choose the appropriate timing; but the situation is not necessarily bad, and the British-Greek side also has many strengths." Reviewing the past seven days of the war, although Nazi forces have made rapid progress in the Croatian and southern Serbian regions of Yugoslavia, as well as in the Thracian and eastern Macedonian regions of Greece, if one considers Hitler's so-called spring offensive, which had already begun preparing and planning as early as October last year when German troops entered Romania, this small victory is more expected than surprising. Moreover: (1) The German army has the advantage of initiative, launching a preemptive strike before the British-Greek-Yugoslav alliance could complete its joint defense mechanism; (2) The German army's mechanized equipment is superior to that of the Allied forces. Since the defeat of France last June, these mechanized units have had nearly ten months to rest and replenish, so their strength is naturally greater than before; (3) The Allied command is not unified. The two sets of battles in Yugoslavia and Greece are completely separate, unlike the German army's unified command, where the battles on each front can coordinate with each other; (4) The British troops arrived at the front not long ago, and were not familiar with the terrain. Their numbers and military strength were also limited, so they only officially came out to help yesterday, and it will naturally be difficult to achieve significant results in the short term; (5) Yugoslavia is in an unfavorable situation of facing enemies on three sides, and is also significantly inferior in terms of equipment, making it difficult to resist the German army's blitzkrieg offensive. At the same time, the terrain of Greek Thrace and eastern Macedonia is a narrow strip, which makes it militarily indefensible.

Based on the above reasons, it can be seen that the initial small victories of the Axis offensive are not surprising. The question is whether this "breakthrough momentum" can be maintained until the complete submission of Greece and Yugoslavia, and the complete withdrawal of British forces from the Balkans, as it did in May and June last year. Assuming that Hitler's blitzkrieg tactics can truly replay last year's achievements, then the combined Axis offensive in the Near East and the Suez Canal, Hitler's implementation of the British landing plan, and even the southward advance of his Far Eastern allies, will of course be staged one after another. However, if the blitzkrieg is just a flash in the pan, and the Balkan war evolves into a protracted war and a war of attrition as the Allied position stabilizes, then this spring offensive, which has come with such force, will be detrimental to the Axis powers. First, the Balkan Peninsula was originally a warehouse of military resources and wartime food for Germany and Italy, suitable for peaceful control but most susceptible to military destruction. If the war lasts for a long time, the Axis's supply of materials will have to be temporarily interrupted. Second, Germany has to use all its strength to deal with the eastern front, so it will have to temporarily shelve the British landing plan, which is most capable of striking the central nervous system of Britain, and give Britain ample time to replenish its war equipment and strengthen its defenses. Third, although the Soviet Union and Turkey are currently only taking a defensive posture, they must be fully vigilant against the Axis forces that are gradually approaching their borders. If the Axis offensive suffers setbacks in the future and creates an opportunity for others, I believe that the Soviet Union and Turkey will definitely re-examine their current posture in order to resolve the current serious threat. Fourth, the US attitude will definitely become more active as the Axis offensive unfolds. Judging from the dynamics of the past few days alone, it is enough to show that Washington is indeed determined to fight. For example, the first batch of military equipment to aid Yugoslavia has already been shipped. In addition to providing the UK with ten anti-smuggling patrol vessels, it has directly and decisively seized more than sixty merchant ships from Denmark and Germany and Italy, preparing to use them to transport military equipment to Egypt, which is one point. President Roosevelt declared the Red Sea a "non-war zone," thus allowing US ships to transport military supplies through the Red Sea to Egypt, which is another point. The US government and Denmark reached an agreement to place the Danish territory of Greenland under US protection. Everyone knows that Germany's blockade line against Britain in the North Atlantic ends at Greenland. After the US took over the island, the US and Germany were already directly facing each other, which is the third point. A giant British warship that was heavily damaged has been repaired by a US shipyard in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act. US Undersecretary of the Navy Forrestal will soon depart for the UK to promote closer cooperation between the British and US navies, which is the fourth point.

From the above, although the Axis countries' spring offensive has been launched, it is taking considerable risks. Unless it goes smoothly, the future will naturally be optimistic. If not, there is a danger of making a mistake that will be regretted for eternity. As it stands, a fierce battle will soon take place within days on the line from Mount Olympus in Greece to Lake Ohrid on the Yugoslav border. This is the first major battle between the main British-Greek forces and the German army, and its outcome is naturally very important. As for the Yugoslav and Greek troops in Yugoslavia and Albania, they will likely launch guerrilla warfare in the future to harass the Axis. At the same time, the extent of US aid will definitely increase day by day until the Allied forces achieve final victory, which is not difficult to predict.

### German Forces Reach the Shores of Lake Ohrid, Meeting with Blackshirt Allies

London, According to Lyon radio, after occupying Niš in central Yugoslavia, Nazi troops are currently advancing towards the capital. Other German forces are moving towards Ljubljana, in order to link up with Italian forces invading northwestern Yugoslavia. According to the Hungarian news agency, German forces that reached Zagreb have linked up with German forces that invaded Yugoslavia from Maribor. German forces have also attacked Ribnik in Croatia, Yugoslavia (75 miles southeast of Zagreb). (Reuters, 12th)

Berlin, The German High Command announced that German forces operating in southern Serbia met with Italian forces on the northern shore of Lake Ohrid on the 11th. Regarding this matter, Hitler telegraphed Mussolini, saying, "As German and Italian forces first join hands and share hardships on the Yugoslav battlefield, I would like to extend my respects to you in the true spirit of comradeship." (Haitong Telegraph, 12th) Enemy forces, hoping to cooperate in battle, constantly patrol and strafe German forces in the mountainous area above the line, and have detected extremely important intelligence regarding German troop deployments. Although the current war situation makes the Greek public somewhat worried, the British Air Force's severe blows to German dive bombers and its guard defense work have given the Greek people encouragement and new faith.

### German War Equipment is Constantly Evolving, Using Giant Machines to Transport Tanks, Paratroopers Undergo Special Training

Vichy, It was learned today that tanks clearing the way and aircraft transporting tanks are just two of the many war tools completed by the ingenious talent of human invention. Unofficial French reports claim that Germany is using large aircraft to transport light, fast tanks to eastern Libya, causing Axis forces to occupy several isolated areas in the direction of Khartum. As a result, the hundreds of miles of desert that tanks cannot cross on their own can be crossed with the help of aircraft. As a result, areas previously isolated behind hundreds of miles of desert and considered safe are now jointly threatened by aircraft and tanks. Parisian newspapers are unleashing terrible fire on enemy defenses. The newspaper also said that the German army is also using bomber units. These units are the vanguard of motorized units, and create a smokescreen behind them. These people rush to enemy defenses and bomb them. The newspaper claimed that this tactic was used to destroy the Metaxas Line. Trained engineers and road builders also accompany the German advance troops. These personnel can use the materials they bring to immediately rebuild destroyed roads and bridges before the German main force arrives. (United Press, 9th) Portica is advancing. There are unconfirmed reports that Romania has begun to act in order to reoccupy the Yugoslav port of Banat (southeast of Banat in Hungary). The Hungarian radio also said that Hungarian forces have entered Yugoslav territory 20 miles south of Szeged without encountering resistance. Hungarian forces entered the Baranja Triangle smoothly. The radio also said that the land that Hungary lost in 1918 and has now reoccupied covers an area of 2,058,000 hectares, with a population of 1,042,000. This lost and reoccupied land of Hungary has been renamed "Vojvodina" by Yugoslavia. This land is divided into three parts. The first part is the so-called Bačka Triangle, located between the current Hungarian border and the Danube and Tisza rivers. The second part is the Cenei area, located east of the Tisza River, between the Tisza and the current Romanian border. The third part is the so-called Srem Triangle, located between the current Hungarian border and the Danube and Sava rivers. These lands are the richest grain-producing areas in Europe, with vast wheat and corn fields, and are an area for raising large numbers of livestock. This land has residents of eleven nationalities, including Hungarians, Germans, Serbs, Croats, Slovaks, Czechs, Romanians, Little Russians, Jews, French, and Spaniards. These people settled here in the 17th century and have formed this inextricable mixture. (United Press, 12th)

Rome, A communiqué this morning stated that Italian troops had occupied the city of Laibach in Yugoslavia (translator's note: European powers held an international conference in this city in 1821). (Haitong Telegraph, 12th)

### British and Greek Air Forces Bomb in Rotation, Advancing German Forces Suffer Heavy Losses

Athens, Yesterday, Allied aircraft were active, focusing their attacks on a German column moving towards Florina in the mountainous area of southern Yugoslavia. German truck and armored vehicle columns on the Florina-Prilep highway were bombed. (Reuters, 10th)

London, A Reuters correspondent with British forces in Greece reported that British bombers at Greek airfields are taking off and landing in batches to load fuel and ammunition, day and night, taking turns bombing concentrated Nazi forces. According to reliable sources, when German forces occupied Monastir in southern Yugoslavia, their tank and armored vehicle columns were decimated, with heavy casualties. Enemy forces on the important transportation line 16 miles south of Florina were also repeatedly attacked, and German forces attempting to break through the Greek defense line near the Yugoslav border were also heavily bombed. British forces also bombed the Italian front, carrying information to the German front lines, stating that the Germans used tanks to throw secret new weapons for the first time in the Balkans. These tanks have new equipment that can throw landmines ahead to destroy enemy positions, prevent enemy attacks, overturn sandbag or concrete defenses, or clear obstacles and open routes when necessary. "The Parisian Evening News" also said that the Germans have also used specially trained paratroopers. These paratroopers wear asbestos clothing used by flamethrower tanks. These paratroopers are dropped from low-flying aircraft. After landing, they rush to nearby positions and point the flamethrower nozzle of the flamethrower tank at the enemy troops.

### Hungary Occupies Yugoslav Territory of More Than 20,000 Square Kilometers

Budapest, The Hungarian radio said that Hungarian forces have occupied a large area of Yugoslav land that previously belonged to Hungary. The Hungarian government has announced that Hungarian troops, under the command of the Regent, have crossed the Trilon border between the Danube and Tisza rivers today (Friday), as well as the Baranja Triangle and the Danube River across from it. Official news agencies said that Hungarian forces arrived at the city of Horogos in Baksa, southwest of Szeged, at 11:00 a.m. yesterday and continued to advance towards the area between the current Romanian border and the Sava River. The third part is the so-called Srem Triangle, located between the current Hungarian border and the Danube and Drava rivers. These lands are the richest grain-producing areas in Europe, with vast wheat and corn fields, and are an area for raising large numbers of livestock. This land has residents of eleven nationalities, including Hungarians, Germans, Serbs, Croats, Slovaks, Czechs, Romanians, Little Russians, Jews, French, and Spaniards. These people settled here in the 17th century and have formed this inextricable mix. (United Press, 12th)

### US President Officially Declares the Red Sea a Non-War Zone, Allowing Ships to Resume Navigation to Transport Aircraft to Egypt, and Declaring Aid to Yugoslavia

Washington, President Roosevelt issued an order today stating that from today, the area from the southern end of the Red Sea, the British port of Aden, to the African coast will no longer be considered a war zone. US merchant ships are now allowed to transport military equipment to Egypt via the Red Sea. (Havas, 11th)

Washington, President Roosevelt has approved the resumption of US ships in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. The President claimed yesterday while hosting news reporters that US ships are permitted to travel through the entire route of the Red Sea to the Suez Canal, because Egypt is a neutral country. The US government does not want to study the issue of whether supplies transported to neutral countries will be transferred to belligerent countries. People here were very excited when they heard that US ships would soon be unloading military supplies at Egyptian ports, at a time when war reports from the Balkans and Libya were unpleasant. Most people hold the hope that these good news will continue to be announced in the future. From the way the President announced that the Red Sea was no longer in a war zone, it can be seen that the President is eager to proceed in order to reach the expected speed without hindering congressional procedures. Newspapers now predict that since the United States has established an air base in Greenland, it will also adopt the same approach in the Azores Islands. Or there are those who ask whether the ports of the Mediterranean are still a war zone, and whether US ports are usable. The President replied that he could not say for sure, but the port of Ismailia in the middle of the Suez Canal was definitely not in a war zone. The US shipping industry believes that the sixty-nine ships of Germany, Italy, and Denmark detained at US ports will be used to transport supplies through the Red Sea to Egypt. (Reuters, 12th)

Washington, President Roosevelt yesterday declared that a state of war now exists between Yugoslavia and Germany and Italy. This declaration is a necessary prelude to the adoption of the restrictive clauses of the US Neutrality Act. According to this clause, it has already been applied to Germany, Italy, and Greece, and now it is applied to Yugoslavia. In other words, Yugoslavia will receive US aid. (Reuters, 12th)

### Italian Plane in Brazil: Violating Neutrality, Airline Fined
     Brazilian Capital: An Italian airline has been fined for flying its planes over Brazilian airspace beyond the legal seven-hour limit and warned that its license will be revoked for repeated offenses. Brazilian authorities say the flights violate Brazil's neutrality. (Reuters, 12th)

Mexican Three-Department Consultation: Confiscation of German and Italian Ships
     Mexico City: Mexico's Navy, Finance, and Economy ministries will send representatives to meet with the head of Mexico's petroleum operations regarding the use of confiscated German and Italian ships. All confiscated ships are currently docked at Tampico and Veracruz ports. The Mexican Navy has increased security to monitor the actions of the crew members and prevent any work slowdowns. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

Konoe Meets with Reporters, Denies Armed Southern Advance: Hopes for Improved US-Japan Relations are Dim, The Tripartite Pact Cannot Be Further Strengthened
     Tokyo: Last night, Prime Minister Konoe entertained reporters from various newspapers, stating that he does not believe Japan has any intention of realizing its southern advance plan by force. He said that what Japan desires in the South Seas region is only economic cooperation, and nothing else. In answering questions, Konoe stated that he was not at liberty to disclose the nature of the talks that Foreign Minister Matsuoka is currently having with Soviet officials in Moscow. However, he dared to assert that Japanese-Soviet relations are now on the right track. Regarding US-Japan relations, Konoe predicted that Britain and the United States might increase aid to Chongqing, but questioned the effectiveness of such aid. As for the current relations between Japan and the United States, he admitted that they are not very promising, but he believed that there is nothing between Japan and the United States that cannot be resolved peacefully. Although he did not expect any improvement, he was certain that the situation would not deteriorate. Konoe continued to discuss the China-Japan situation, stating that he made a statement on November 3, 1938, and his basic policy has not changed. If the Chongqing government can abandon its policy of resistance, he would be very happy to negotiate a general peace for all of China. He believed that the relocation of certain personnel in Chongqing could immediately facilitate the realization of a general peace for all of China. Konoe then mentioned the Batavia conference, saying that the Dutch East Indies seemed to firmly believe in the eventual victory of Britain. Currently, the Dutch East Indies is hesitant to supply Japan with raw materials for fear that they will be used to benefit Germany, which has caused difficulties in the conference. Regarding the economic talks between Japan and France on Vietnam, they will soon conclude peacefully. Japan is not seeking any reward for mediating the border dispute between Thailand and Vietnam. This will surely garner a good impression from outside parties, including the Dutch East Indies. Finally, a reporter asked about rumors that the Tripartite Pact would continue to be strengthened. Konoe replied that it seemed that there was no way to further strengthen what was already included in the current form of the pact. After the Foreign Minister returns to Tokyo, he may report on his conversations with German and Italian politicians. He has not yet received a telegram from him, so everything must wait until his return. Konoe concluded by discussing domestic politics, stating that the recent cabinet reshuffle was of great significance, but the basic principles of the new economic structure would not be changed by the entry of anyone into the cabinet. The government still insists on the low-price policy. The Great Political Assistance Association, which has recently been reorganized and completed, has the sole purpose of building a new national structure. Konoe praised the Diet Members' Club, recognizing it as a social organization, and expressed his readiness to join as a member of the House of Peers. (Reuters, 12th)

British Ambassador Sir Kerr Arrives in Singapore: To Participate in Important Talks
     Singapore: British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, arrived here today. It is expected that Kerr will participate in important talks with Far East British Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, other military leaders, and Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Shenton Thomas.

Large Numbers of Japanese Residents in America Return Home
     Yokohama: The Tatsuta Maru arrived here yesterday from the United States, carrying 711 passengers, with all berths full. Most of them were family members of Japanese merchants in the United States. The manager of the Kanebo Spinning Company's New York branch also returned to Japan with his family on this ship. In addition, there were also family members of twenty Japanese merchants in New York. Since the implementation of the US ban, Japanese businesses have been operating with difficulty and are downsizing, forcing them to send their families back to Japan. (Reuters, 12th)

Japanese Government Plans to Utilize the Siberian Route
     Tokyo: At a meeting of Japanese government officials yesterday, the Minister of Communications stated that the Japanese government is now seeking to utilize the Siberian route to establish close contact with Germany. This route is becoming increasingly important for transportation between Japan and other countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and Germany, Italy, and other countries due to the current international situation. (Reuters, 12th)

Philippine Islands to Establish Coast Guard: Composed of Torpedo Speedboats, Entirely Under Army Control
     Manila: In addition to the existing American-style army in the Philippines, a coast guard is now being established, which will be under the control of the army and organized with small, high-speed torpedo boats. In addition to the two existing small boats nicknamed "Waterborne Army", the Philippine Army plans to deploy two squadrons of these speedboats, with thirty-six boats to be built by 1946. Each boat will cost US$75,000. Due to current transportation bottlenecks, the shipment of machinery is very difficult, and the progress of this project is inevitably delayed. The Philippine Army has tentatively decided to manufacture the hulls locally and purchase the engines from the United States, which can utilize the provisions of the American Vincent Act (i.e., the US Navy Department can sell naval equipment to the Philippine Islands at cost). The boats will be equipped with torpedo tubes and depth charges, .50 caliber machine guns, and radio receivers and transmitters, and will have a speed of 45 miles per hour. The Philippine Army firmly believes that for a small country unable to build a large navy, the best means of self-defense is a squadron of torpedo speedboats. Each main battleship costs US$60 million, which could build one thousand speedboats. If this squadron of small boats can be well managed, effectively organized, and supported by the air force, it can inflict heavy damage on invading enemies. (United Press, 12th)

Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Leaves USSR Today: Japan Claims It Will Sign a New Commercial Treaty with the USSR, Large Quantities of Soviet Supplies Arrive in China
     Moscow: Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka returned here from Leningrad at 11:20 AM today and held a second meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. According to Japanese sources, the two sides met for more than two hours and exchanged views on various issues. In the evening, Matsuoka will attend a performance at the Moscow Opera House and is scheduled to leave the USSR on Sunday. (Havas, 11th)
     Tokyo: A Japanese government spokesman told reporters yesterday that a Japanese-Soviet commercial treaty is now almost ready to be signed. When asked whether this treaty would be signed by Foreign Minister Matsuoka, who is currently in Moscow, the spokesman replied that he could not comment on that. He also said that the treaty is likely based on a barter system, with regulations on the quantities and types of goods to be exchanged. Japan hopes to have large-scale trade with the Soviet Union, but it must start on a small scale. (Reuters, 12th)
     Chongqing: Reuters has learned from responsible sources that although Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka is currently in Moscow conducting Soviet-Japanese negotiations, these negotiations will not affect the Soviet Union's policy of aiding China. Large quantities of Soviet supplies are currently arriving in China, which is clear evidence of this. However, the details of these supplies have not yet been disclosed. (Reuters, 12th)

War Spreads Throughout Europe: Soviet Union Cannot Stand Idly By, Turkish Parliamentarian Calls for Swift Intervention, Bulgarian Army Withdraws Several Miles from Turkish Border
     Turkish Capital: Turkish National Assembly member Dahit recently published an article in the "Yeni Sabah" newspaper, urging the Soviet Union to intervene immediately in the current European war. The article stated, in brief, that the flames of war have already spread throughout Europe, and the Soviet Union can hardly remain in a volatile position. The people of all countries who have so far remained outside of the current European war have an immediate need to intervene. If the United States and the Soviet Union can join the war, their effectiveness will be great. (Havas, 10th)

Japanese Official Circles Focus on British-American-Dutch Meeting
     Tokyo: A Japanese government spokesman acknowledged yesterday that it is worth noting that officials from the Dutch East Indies participated in the meeting of British and American defense chiefs held in Manila. However, he did not agree with the "encirclement" theory and stated that Japan is merely observing the situation with great interest. It seems that Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands are quite alarmed, but Japan has no territorial ambitions in the South Seas, only wanting economic benefits. He also said that Japan must pay attention to the actions of its neighbors. (Reuters, 12th)
     Swiss Capital: The "Lausanne Daily" recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that the Bulgarian army has withdrawn several miles from the Turkish border. It is evident from this that the Axis powers have peaceful intentions towards Turkey and want to establish a neutral zone at the border between the two countries. (Havas, 11th)
     Chongqing: The "Xinhua Daily" editorialized yesterday morning on the Balkan situation, stating that the Soviet Union may not help the South fight against Germany, nor will it help Germany attack Britain. It would be a big mistake to regard the Soviet-South non-aggression pact as a sign of Soviet aid to the South against Germany. The Soviet-South treaty is very different from the Soviet-Turkish treaty, because their geography and history are different. The Soviet-Turkish joint declaration can guarantee the maintenance of their neutral and peaceful policies. (Reuters, 12th)

Son of Romanian President to Fly to Chongqing Within the Week
     Washington: The New York Times reported, citing Washington official sources, that President Roosevelt's son, James Roosevelt, who is currently serving in the Marine Corps, plans to fly from San Francisco to Chongqing on April 19 and then travel to Cairo to serve as an observer for the US government. According to Marine Corps authorities who spoke to the Central News Agency reporter, this statement has not yet been confirmed, but it is understood that James Roosevelt has obtained a passport from the Chinese Embassy. Major Thomas also obtained a passport, and both officers' titles are Assistant Naval Attaché at the US Embassy in Britain. The length of James Roosevelt's stay in Chongqing has not been specified, but according to the New York Times, after arriving in Chongqing, he plans to discuss everything with the Chinese government authorities. The remaining observers sent by the US government to Cairo also plan to fly to Chongqing soon and then travel to Cairo. The reason why the US is sending observers such as James Roosevelt to Cairo is that important battles are about to begin there. (11th)
     Chongqing: According to a Chinese newspaper report from Washington, President Roosevelt's son, James, will take a clipper plane from San Francisco to Chongqing on the 19th of this month and travel to Cairo. It is reported that James and Major Thomas have obtained passports from the Chinese Embassy, and both serve as Assistant Naval Attachés at the US Embassy in London. In addition, several other observers will soon depart on a clipper plane and travel to Egypt via China. (Reuters, 12th)

Those Close to the Chinese Communist Party Deny Mao Zedong's Trip to the Soviet Union: Japanese-Soviet Relations Will Soon Improve, Resistance and National Reconstruction Policy Will Never Change
     Chongqing: A person close to the Chinese Communist Party recently made a statement, firmly denying the rumor that Mao Zedong would go to Moscow. They also said that any improvement in Soviet-Japanese relations will not change the policies held on resistance and national reconstruction and the united front. This person recently commented on the fact that Matsuoka has delayed his departure from the Soviet Union and that the Soviet ambassador to Germany has met with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, believing that the main point of the Japanese-Soviet talks is that Germany agreed to supply Japan with aircraft through the Soviet Union. Japan's southern advance may depend on whether this issue can be satisfactorily resolved, because this adventurous move is purely a matter for the navy and air force. Without German assistance, the strength of the Japanese air force would not be able to cope. However, even if Germany could provide thousands of aircraft, along with pilots, to assist Japan, the Soviet Union may not allow them to transit to Japan, because it is not impossible that Japan would use these aircraft against the Soviet Union in the future.

Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi Broadcasts Farewell to the British: Britain, America, and China Will Cooperatively Lead the World, Candidates for Ambassador Exchange Between China and Australia Internally Designated
     Chongqing: According to reliable sources, Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi will return here within three weeks to take up his new post after being transferred to Foreign Minister. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)
     London: Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi, who has been stationed in the United Kingdom for nine years, is about to return home to take up the post of Foreign Minister. In his farewell speech broadcast last night, he said, in brief, that he believed that the East and West could definitely blend together, and the world after the war would definitely be reorganized. In this great era of world reorganization, what he thinks of first is ABC, namely, America, Britain, and China. He has a deep belief in cooperation between the East and West. In the future peace, Britain and the United States will see themselves working together with China, the Soviet Union, Australia, New Zealand, and India. He also hopes that Japan will join this work after its sanity is restored. However, China must first complete its victory. Any superficial promises of goodwill and military efforts on the part of Japan cannot change China's belief in its final victory. The policy of appeasement is dead in Europe and also in Asia. Today, the British all know that China's war of resistance is the key to influencing the world situation. Japan is not only attacking China, but also threatening Britain's position in Singapore and the Western Pacific. (Reuters, 12th)

Random Talks on the European War (IV)(V): Cannons, Helmets, and Other Items
     The difficulties and complexities of modern artillery shooting are no less than tracing the orbit of a comet in the sky or guiding a ship along a certain course in the sea. In today's land warfare, only anti-aircraft guns can be directly fired at visible targets by gunners. Other types of cannons, from three-inch field guns to sixteen-inch coastal defense cannons, all use mathematical calculations to aim at targets, and the gunner cannot directly see these targets.
     When opening modern cannons on land or warships, many factors should be taken into account when aiming, so that the shells can hit or reach the point where they are not hit but not far away. For example, gravity, wind direction and wind force, the temperature of the day, air pressure, the friction of the gun barrel, the shape and weight of the shell, etc., should all be taken into account when calculating the curved path of the shell after it is launched.
     There are two main types of shell trajectories, which are easy for people who can play tennis to understand. Cannons with very long barrels usually have a smaller angle of elevation when firing, and the fired shells travel along a long, low, flat trajectory, just like when a tennis player hits a fast ball, the ball goes to the end of the court. Howitzers are different. Their barrels are very short, and the angle of elevation is very high when fired, throwing the shells high into the air, and then landing within a very short distance, just like hitting a tennis ball into the air, just landing on the other side of the net.
     In naval battles, the swaying of the hull, speed, and the direction of the enemy ship should also be taken into account when firing. In land warfare, whether the shells are piled in the sun or in the shade under the bridge, the firing situation is quite different. If the gunpowder is dry, the shell will be fired farther, because the gunpowder burns faster when it is dry, and it will generate a larger explosion force.
     Historically, the farthest-firing cannon was the cannon that Germany used to bombard Paris from 75 miles away in 1918. The shells used by this cannon weighed 265 pounds and traveled at a speed of one mile per second after leaving the cannon. The caliber of the cannon was eight inches, and the barrel was extremely long, so it had to be supported by a frame to prevent it from collapsing due to its own weight.
     The shells fired by this cannon gradually rose to a height of about 24 miles, and then, due to the restraint of gravity, the speed was reduced to half a mile every half second. When the shell turned towards the ground along its trajectory, the speed increased again due to the downward pull of gravity and the thinness of the air at high altitude. Finally, when it reached the thicker air above the ground, the speed would decrease again. Even the rotation of the earth should be taken into account when firing. Because if this cannon is fired to the west, the rotation of the earth will cause the target to move forward, meeting the shell traveling in the air.
     During this World War, Germany also had a cannon that could fire from the French coast across the English Channel, with a range of 90 miles. This cannon had a thin and long barrel, and its shape was quite peculiar. Because the barrel was very long, it needed to be hoisted with thick ropes to prevent it from collapsing. There were four giant ropes running through it from the breech to the muzzle, and a support was set in the middle of the barrel. In this way, the support supporting the barrel and the giant ropes surrounding the barrel were like a radio station standing in the air. It is not yet known how large the caliber of the cannon is, but it is about ten inches, and the length of the barrel is fifty feet. The strength of the gunpowder fired by this cannon must be higher than the gunpowder used by ordinary cannons. Although other countries know this medicine, they have not adopted it because its destructive power to the barrel is too great.
     Because many factors can affect the curved path of the shell, the shooting of cannons does not necessarily have to choose a target. Shells usually fall on a large ground around the target, and only a few shells directly hit the target. Coastal defense cannons have a slight advantage over cannons on warships because they are installed on stable gun mounts. As long as a shore-based cannon hits any part of a warship, it will be fatal, while a cannon on a warship attacking a fortress on the coast cannot destroy its war power unless it hits the cannon itself.
     The origin of helmets Now the soldiers in the European war, whether British or German, and even the civilians in the rear, all wear helmets on their heads to prevent stray bullets or fragments from visiting. This hat is made of thinly pressed steel sheets, one-eighth of an inch thick and weighs two pounds. In terms of its function of protecting the head, it is more difficult to avoid bullets, but it is very effective in preventing shrapnel and grapeshot. French soldiers were the first to use it in the Great War until 1915, and the number of head injuries to soldiers was reduced by 75 percent. In the Great War, 48 percent of all head injuries were fatal. At the beginning of the war, the German army used studded helmets, which were not for protection. Most of their materials were leather and canvas, and the Germans have always worn this kind of military cap. Later, the German army saw that the steel helmets worn by the French soldiers were very effective in protecting against bullets, so they also began to imitate them. In less than a few months, the round "pot"-style steel hat was found on the heads of German soldiers.
     The lost key to the house An official engaged in disaster relief work in London received a key as a donation one day, with a note attached. It read:. "The house to which this key belongs has been bombed. Please accept this key for the manufacture of military equipment. "The key without a door has lost its use, but Britain is fighting hard, and the required items, no matter how small, are very urgent. Even this key can be melted together with other scrap iron and used to manufacture weapons. Therefore, the official who received the donation of the key was not surprised by its small size or felt discouraged.
     The plight of the French The lives of the French people after the fall are very painful. However, in terms of food, fuel and daily necessities, there is no place that is not restricted by the government. Last winter, during Christmas, the residents were making the best of a bad situation. Although the custom of giving gifts had not stopped, the things they sent to each other were difficult to obtain. If someone sent a piece of scented soap or half a pound of sugar to their relatives and friends, the recipient would regard it as a precious item and show it off. As for roses, sweets, and chocolates in southern France, no one dared to ask about them, because the prices were too high and the things were very rare. During the holidays, residents could buy two ounces more cheese and four ounces of rice, and also buy meat, sauces, and chickens and ducks on the same day. As for cakes and wheat, only those with bread coupons could buy them. Because of the extreme shortage of fuel, it was impossible to start a fire in the house, let alone say anything else. Even the number of train trips was greatly reduced. The reason for this is not only because of the lack of coal, but also because the lubricating oil used in the vehicles and engines could not be found. Due to the lack of fat and sugar, colds, sore throats, and colds were very popular among the residents. Except for infants, the supply of milk has been greatly reduced. Butter is not easy to see on the table, and cheese is also strictly limited in consumption. As for soap, because of the lack of raw materials, the water content has greatly increased, and there is no way to talk about the effect of removing dirt and grease.
     The famine in Belgium At the beginning of the war in Belgium, there was already very little food in the country, so the food problem was already very serious. Since the fall to the German army, the Belgian people have undoubtedly been driven onto the road of hunger. Even according to the method of rationing by population prescribed by the Germans, it is still impossible for the people to get enough to eat. Because the rations they receive are always less than a percentage. Compared with Germany, the food distribution number of the Belgian people is only one-third of that of the Germans. Taking potatoes as an example, the Belgian people get only 20 percent of what the Germans get. In some places, they have not seen bread for two or three days in a row. The amount of edible oil that has been allocated is very small, only 6%. As for the sale of meat, it is even more irregular, and it is regarded as a rare item. The wheat needed by Belgium comes mostly from the Soviet Union, France, and Germany. Before the autumn harvest last year, at least 300,000 tons of wheat had to be transported to maintain the distribution of food. During the war, it was estimated that at least 10,000 tons of stored wheat were destroyed by the heavy troops of the German, British, and French sides. Commercial news and finance The spot exchange rate has fallen
     A few days ago, the city had an excess of cash, and the spot exchange rate for each 10,000 yuan was as high as 35 yuan. Since the news was released, it has attracted the attention of all walks of life. Recently, the Central, China, and Communications Banks have been accepting legal tender as much as possible. At the same time, Qianku also accepts two or three yuan of cash from each banker every day. The spot exchange rate is getting lower every day, and now it is only about 10 yuan per 10,000 yuan. If the three banks continue to accept it, it is expected to return to the flat exchange rate. According to the principle that the silver industry should regulate finance, the exchange rate for transfers and cash should be the same. Under the current social situation, the settlement of bills between peers should be based on mutual clearing of accounts, and it is not appropriate to refuse bills on the grounds of "only redeeming cash" to reduce the risk on the way.

Food Yangon rice arrives in Shanghai 50,000 bags
     Foreign rice continues to arrive, the other day Lai Ci foreign firm Brian Xu (Norah Maller) Muller transport, directly from Yangon to transport rice to Shanghai, had recorded the previous report, now learned that the ship from Yangon to load more than 56,000 bags of foreign rice, docked at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong, is now unloading, another Muller ship is also from Yangon to load rice to Shanghai, can arrive in a few days, Taikoo Company's Chengdu ship, from Hong Kong to transport 16,022 bags of foreign rice, yesterday morning at ten o'clock arrived at the port, docked in the French Concession Benhang wharf, unloading, another 100 bags of foreign rice to Qingdao, 354 bags to Yantai, will be loaded on the original ship next week, securities will have one more shipping company Asia Shipping Company The city's foreign merchants are preparing The city's foreign merchants, newly organized a "Asia Shipping Company", in accordance with the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, approved capital of one hundred million yuan of Chinese currency, divided into ten million shares, each share of ten yuan, now has received a share of twenty million yuan, intends to issue another ten million yuan, this ten million yuan, of which half is allocated to Jardine Matheson shareholders to buy, the other half is to solicit people from all walks of life to buy, the purpose of the shipping company is to rent ships from Panama or other appropriate countries after renovation, leased out for the purpose of transporting goods, (Public) Piece goods The factory's woolen cloth The raw materials are not sufficient, the output is reduced The price is expensive, the sales are very strong The woolen cloth of this factory, the daily output of large and small factories, are gradually reduced, because of the lack of raw wool money, it is predicted that those that can be transported before October of this year are like phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, the limited amount of wool in the Shanghai area, the price is frequently rising, and there is no cash available to search, each factory only uses its own system, absolutely can not be allocated to transfer or transfer, the smaller range of factories, I am afraid that there will be a tendency to reduce work or suspend work before October, larger range such as Jardine, Yongxing, Xiexin, Yinfeng, Zhanghua, etc., therefore, for the output, now they are all more careful, not as good as the past mutual competition to seek mass production, in terms of sales, it is more smooth than in previous years, because the price has continued to rise, and it is still cheaper than the goods that come from the road, taking the length among the dwarfs, resulting in sales are still very widespread, However, the imported goods are definitely very few, watching its actual sales are still strong, the customer gang business, this spring is more than the previous year, the inland gang procurement, most of the seven or eight designated the factory's goods, so the factory's woolen cloth price is expensive, and its sales, very prosperous, sugar market The sugar market is extremely prosperous Taiko white rose half a yuan outside Yesterday the sugar market rose extremely prosperous, a time is not easy to return to loose, resulting in market prices continued to rise, the guild disk, two four coarse white spot 90 yuan, up two angles, this month's 20th single 90 yuan two angles to three angles five points, up three angles five points, the end of the month single 90 yuan nine angles to 91 yuan two angles, up four angles, Taiko white rose even more fierce, B mark 92 yuan, DY mark 86 yuan, HX mark West Depot 85 yuan, East Depot 84 yuan half, up five angles outside, import and export Soybeans and cotton cloth are transported to Hong Kong Ocean goods have not been heard of imported during the Easter holiday, but export goods today there are 65 pieces of tea transported to Hong Kong, 1,115 bags of soybeans transported to Hong Kong, 580 pieces of piece goods transported to Hong Kong, 870 pieces of cotton yarn transported to Hong Kong, towels (continued) Guo Xiuruo The above said, seems to have some reason, but not entirely true, because the towel's strong and washable, not in the "raw yarn" "cooked yarn" problem, lies in the towel itself strong and not; towel strong, weight, bottom plate, hair tight, then whether it is "raw yarn", "cooked yarn" can be washable; if the towel quality is light, bottom plate hair loose, then whether "raw yarn" "cooked yarn" are not very strong, this is the inevitable reason, do not have to doubt! Towel, in the beginning, did not study the fancy, only in the two ends of the towel, woven with red file, blue file, and so on

### Roosevelt Signs Order Reaffirming Pan-American Resolution: No Transfer of Western Hemisphere Territory Allowed; Denmark's External Shock Over U.S. Taking Over Greenland

Washington: The twenty-one American republics previously passed a resolution at the Pan-American Conference in Havana, Cuba, stipulating that if a non-American country transfers any of its Western Hemisphere territory to another non-American country, the American nations should consult with each other and jointly discuss countermeasures. President Roosevelt today signed an order reaffirming this resolution, and declared that the United States will not recognize any such transfer of territory in the Western Hemisphere. In addition, the President told the press that Greenland, belonging to Denmark, is also within the Western Hemisphere according to the Pan-American Conference's decision. The West Indian islands of Guadeloupe belonging to France, and Trinidad belonging to Britain, are also part of the Western Hemisphere. Regarding the Greenland issue, the U.S. government has notified other American governments of all relevant information at any time. It is reported that the Danish government has already reached an agreement with the United States, stipulating that the United States may establish naval and air bases in Greenland and place the island under U.S. protection. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

New York: Newspapers are calling the U.S. establishment of bases in Greenland the U.S.'s "newest vanguard." President Roosevelt's action has received unanimous praise from newspapers, and even isolationists believe it is a good plan to strengthen U.S. defenses. However, some public law scholars strongly argue that Greenland's base, without the assistance of the British Navy, has little value as the United States' first line of defense. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

Copenhagen: Regarding the issue of Greenland being placed under U.S. protection, the Danish Foreign Ministry stated yesterday that the Danish government did not instruct Minister Kauffmann in the U.S. to conduct this negotiation, so this news is quite surprising. The minister has also not reported this matter to the government, so the government is completely unaware of it. It is expected that the government will issue a statement today and take appropriate steps to prevent the United States' illegal actions. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)
