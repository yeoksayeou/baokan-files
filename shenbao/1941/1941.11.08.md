### The Heroic Stand of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union: America Resolves to Give Full Assistance; Roosevelt's Address to the International Labor Organization: Encouraging Representatives to Strive for Freedom

Reuters, Washington, 7th - President Roosevelt (pictured) last night addressed the International Labor Office assembly here, reiterating America's firm resolve to aid China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. He stated that after years of trials, the ILO has consistently worked to reduce working hours, protect female and child labor in agriculture and industry, improve the living conditions of sailors, and make factories and mines suitable workplaces for humanity. Though, due to the upheaval of the world war, which has lasted over two years, and driven by the tyranny of Hitler, you have left your permanent offices in Geneva, through the efforts of our friend, Mr. Winant (former director of the ILO and later U.S. Ambassador to Britain), you have been able to continue your duties here. You are prepared, when the world war ends, to fulfill your responsibilities in formulating the social policies that will underpin lasting peace. The core of our struggle lies in freedom for all. Without enlightened social policies, there can be no true freedom for the common person. In the final analysis, what democratic nations are fighting for today is precisely this enlightened social policy. Your concerns are the concerns of the people of all democratic nations. For many member states, participating in the ILO has come at great sacrifice. Yet, representatives from nations groaning under the yoke of dictators still faithfully attend this meeting, which is the greatest testament to the ILO’s vitality. Therefore, I welcome these representatives. Some labor leaders are today languishing in concentration camps for daring to uphold principles without which civilization cannot exist. I extend my hand in encouragement to these representatives of labor. To those of you who come from devastated regions, America wishes to tell your people, "You have not been forgotten." America is now striving to assist nations resisting aggression. For example, workers in Wisconsin, who used to manufacture aluminum products, have sacrificed their livelihoods so that we can build airplanes to aid Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. The majority of rubber workers in various factories have also sacrificed immediate employment opportunities so that ships can transport airplanes and tanks to Liverpool, Akansas, and Rangoon. Hundreds of thousands of automobile workers have also switched to other jobs so that the steel used for automobiles can be used by American factories to manufacture weapons to pierce Hitler.

The American People Will Not Abandon Joining the Common Defense

Although we in America have not yet made any real sacrifices, we have not suffered aerial bombardment like the brave people of Britain, nor can we imagine the extent of the sacrifices made by the Chinese people in their struggle against aggression and for freedom. We have watched with astonishment as the Russians, over the past four months, have resisted the Nazi war machine at the cost of countless lives and a scorched earth policy. The struggle of ordinary men and women in Europe, from Norway to Greece, against violence is especially admirable. Though violence is strong, it will never be enough to destroy the fight for freedom. As far as the American people are concerned, this effort will not be in vain. The heroic stand of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union will receive the full support of the free people of the Americas. Our people will not abandon their right to join the common defense. Although there are still some industrialists and labor leaders in America who place their private interests above the nation's welfare, and a few who place their petty victories over each other above a great victory over Hitler, and others who place their business interests above national defense obligations, and still others who use their so-called economic policies to force people to accept their demands and deliberately delay the production of defense supplies, these are but a very small minority and do not represent the entirety of American labor and management. The American people have made an unlimited commitment to make the world free, and no individual or group will be allowed to violate this commitment. Defending democratic nations is defending ourselves. This is something American workers know without needing to be told. Those of you who come from occupied countries in Europe and China have told the assembly in detail how you are struggling and persevering, and how unified social progress has been devastated by barbarians.

Urging Workers to Increase Production, Sending Products to the Battlefield Daily

After Germany conscripted its own workers into the army and sent them to the front lines to meet the needs of its total war, it imported about two million foreign civilians into the country to supplement its manpower. The Nazis have turned the occupied territories into slave production sites for their use, and Berlin has become the world's largest slave market. If Hitler wins, what will be the fate of American workers and their free labor organizations? American workers have no doubt about this. They know that their own freedom and the safety of the American people cannot be guaranteed in a world that is three-quarters enslaved and one-quarter free. They also know that we must supply Britain, the Soviet Union, and China with armaments, and we must do so today. Our place in the Nazi plan for world domination, as well as the place of the entire Western Hemisphere, has already been marked on the Nazi timetable. What we must choose now is whether we should make complete sacrifices, actively produce, and send our products to battlefields around the world every day, or whether we should be satisfied with the current rate of arms production, delay making real sacrifices, as the French people did before, and have endless regrets in the future. The former is the choice of those who adhere to reality, who work three shifts a day, actively operate all their machines day and night, and work tirelessly to rush production. The latter is the path of the deluded and those who naively believe they can still negotiate with Hitler. Only in working and struggling for victory must we not forget that our ultimate goal is not just victory. The defeat of Hitlerism is essential, without which there is no freedom. But if we do not prepare for the future now, this war will, like the last war, only produce destruction.

The World Economy Has Been Disrupted; Fundamental Solutions Depend on Cooperation

We are now planning for a better world that we want to create. If the future world is to be one in which peace can exist, then each country must have a more abundant life. There are countless billions of people in the world who do not have enough food, clothing, and housing. If the free people of the world undertake to provide a proper standard of living for these billions of people, then all men and women seeking work can obtain work. We have already begun to study the world's immediate needs after the war, as the world economy has been disrupted by the war. We intend to achieve fundamental solutions, which are to help establish a more stable life. Achieving this goal is not easy and requires the fullest cooperation of all countries in the economic sphere (quoting the Atlantic Charter). We deeply know that social and economic problems, in the international sphere, are like those in the national sphere, not separate and unrelated. In international events, just as in national events, economic policies can no longer be limited to economics. Economic policies are just a means to achieve social goals. There must be no room for the special interests of individuals or nations in the postwar world. At this point, the President again quoted the Atlantic Charter regarding the equal need for commerce and access to raw materials, and continued that the International Labor Organization, with its representatives from both labor and management, and its technical knowledge and experience, will be an extremely valuable tool in planning this kind of international action. Your organization will have a major task in creating stable international systems of social justice for people everywhere. The American people are determined to actively embrace this opportunity and shoulder this historical responsibility.

Praising China's Resistance to Aggression, Displaying a Strong Attitude Towards Japan

Reuters, Washington, 7th - According to observers here, several sections of President Roosevelt's remarks to the representatives of the International Labor Organization seem to have special significance for Japan. While U.S.-Japan talks are taking place here, the President, while pointing out and condemning aggressor nations, has never mentioned Japan. However, in his remarks yesterday, the President specifically mentioned China several times, praised its struggle against aggression and for freedom, and promised to actively assist China. This appears to be America's response to Japan's suggestion that the United States should recognize Japan's victory and Japan as the hegemon of the Pacific.

Associated Press, London, 7th - Yesterday, well-informed circles here considered President Roosevelt's speech to the representatives of the International Labor Organization in New York as "a comforting and practical clarification of America's attitude." These people were especially pleased with President Roosevelt's firm commitment to providing full assistance to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union in their urgent needs. Political circles were deeply interested in President Roosevelt's mentioning the supply of military equipment to China along with Britain and the Soviet Union. They believe this is an indication that the United States will continue its strong stance in the U.S.-Japan talks.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Receives Foreign Journalists, Stresses the Need for Anti-Aggression Nations to Unite, Praises Britain and the United States for Sincerely Assisting China

Chongqing - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek recently made a statement to dozens of foreign journalists, saying that anti-aggression nations will soon adopt an active offensive to deal with aggressors, and added, "I believe that in the near future, you will see that what I say is true." Chiang Kai-shek emphasized the necessity for anti-aggression nations to unite in military affairs and joint production. Chiang Kai-shek highly praised the assistance provided to China by the U.S. Military Advisory Group and the British and American Economic Missions, saying that this move is one of the strongest foundations for the unity of anti-aggression nations. He stated that the benefits of unity have already been obtained and are quite evident, with several aggressive fronts now merely threatening and hesitating to take action, being nothing more than paper tigers. This is because we are already in an active position, and I believe that in the near future, we can see facts proving the accuracy of my words. (Associated Press, 7th)

### First Collection of Rare Treasures from the Siku Quanshu Donated to Britain and the United States

Chongqing - The National Central Library, during its preparatory period, was ordered to print the first collection of rare treasures from the Siku Quanshu, and had previously donated several copies to libraries in Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to promote Chinese culture. This spring, it was approved by the Ministry of Education to donate more copies of the first collection of rare treasures from the Siku Quanshu, four copies to Britain, seven copies to the United States, and three copies to the Soviet Union. Most of them have now arrived at their destinations. The University of Rangoon in Burma, the International University in Bengal, and the Imperial Library in Calcutta have successively sent letters of thanks. The library had previously sent a letter of condolence after the British Houses of Parliament were bombed by German planes, with the House of Lords Library also being affected. Mr. Kidd, the Librarian of the British House of Commons, has replied to thank Mr. Chiang, the Director, and expressed his admiration for China's struggle. (7th Dispatch)

### The U.S. Considers Withdrawing Troops Stationed in Beiping and Tianjin

Washington - President Roosevelt announced at a press conference today that the U.S. government is currently considering withdrawing the U.S. Marines from Beiping and Tianjin, but he did not know when a decision would be reached. President Roosevelt also said in response to a question that the United States and Japan had never discussed the stationing of U.S. Marines in three locations in China at any time. President Roosevelt avoided answering the question of whether this withdrawal would create a new situation for American residents in China and refused to explain what he meant. (Reuters, 7th)

### Japanese Troops Besieged in Northern Henan, Their Retreat Cut Off; Intense Fighting in the Area of Xinzhongmou and the New Yellow River

Luoyang - (1) This time, when the Chinese army recovered Zhengzhou, there were a large number of wounded and dead soldiers transported east from the Longhai and Pinghan railways via Kaifeng, and north via Changxiang. (2) Song Mingbin, the battalion commander of the Wuzhi County Special Service Battalion, understood the greater good and led all his officers and soldiers to defect in a village west of Wuzhi on the night of the 2nd. (3) More than a thousand Japanese troops besieged at the Yellow River Iron Bridge, Ba Wang Cheng, and Han Tong fiercely counterattacked the Chinese forces yesterday to cover the Japanese retreat. After repeated battles by the Chinese army, many Japanese soldiers were killed and wounded. The Chinese also sent strong units to the rear of the Japanese to cut off their retreat. (4) The Japanese in Zhongmou and southwest of the New Yellow River, unable to escape due to the close pursuit of the Chinese army, desperately tried to escape and launched counterattacks, adding heavy artillery. The Japanese are again crossing the river to the east, and fierce fighting is still underway. (7th Dispatch)

### Foreign Exchange Administration to Revise Measures for Settling Export Goods, Enabling Exporters to Promote Exports

Chongqing - According to sources at the Foreign Exchange Administration, the current measures for guaranteeing the settlement of foreign exchange for export goods will be revised to facilitate export merchants. The current guarantee measures require exporters to have a registered company as a guarantor or to pay cash to guarantee that the foreign exchange earned from their goods will be sold to banks designated by the government. This will be changed so that registered firms can also act as guarantors, and if cash is paid, the amount will be reduced, and reasonable interest will be given. The government will also accept Class A national construction savings bonds for payment. Government officials said that the intention of this move is to facilitate export merchants and thus promote export trade. (Havas, 7th)

### Prize Money Increased for Special Prize-Linked Savings

Chongqing - The Executive Yuan recently passed revisions to the measures for issuing special prize-linked savings bonds. It is learned that these measures will change the denomination of each bond from fifty yuan to ten yuan, divided into two strips, each still sold for five yuan. The top prize will increase from 200,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan. Those who do not win a prize will receive generous interest when the principal is repaid at the end of the five-year term. (Havas, 7th)

### Sichuan Gentlemen Huang Tieqiu and Others Donate Military Grain

Chengdu - Huang Tieqiu, a gentleman of Jiang'an County, donated 1,000 shi of grain for military use, which has been verified and accepted by the county's grain management committee. In addition, the gentlemen of Dazhu County jointly donated 1,130 market shi of rice, which has been inspected and accepted by the county government together with the supervising officer stationed in the county and handed over to the grain management committee for transportation to Chongqing. The gentlemen of Santai County donated 12 shi and 9 dou and 7 sheng of military grain and 10,846 yuan and 8 fen in cash in lieu of grain. The military grain was received by the military grain custodian, and the cash was allocated to donation committees. The Sichuan Donation of Military Grain Committee is completing the verification and awarding of prizes to the relevant counties for their donation work to encourage them. (7th Dispatch)

### Director of the China Agricultural Credit Administration Discusses Agricultural Loan Policies

Chongqing - Qiao Qiming, the newly appointed director of the Agricultural Loan Department of the China Farmers Bank, has taken office. He said that the total amount of agricultural loans from various banks has reached more than 420 million yuan, but the borrowers are landlords who hoard and speculate, and the middle peasants have become rich peasants, while the tenant farmers are being oppressed. Therefore, future loans should be limited to direct producers. (Havas, 8th)

### Australian Ships Armed for Self-Defense

Associated Press, New York, 7th - The National Broadcasting Company obtained a radio report yesterday that the Australian government has ordered all ships flying the Australian flag, whether docked in any port or going to any destination, to be immediately armed for self-defense.

### If Japan Ventures to Invade Yunnan, It Will Encounter Immense Difficulties; The Natural Hazards of the Highway Make It Extremely Difficult to Pass; Chinese Defenses Are Exceptionally Solid; Rumors of Clashes on the Yunnan-Vietnam Border

Hanoi - Japanese reinforcements have arrived in Haiphong. Although some are currently taking trains south, the majority remain in the Tonkin area. While a Japanese advance to the north is not impossible, considering the high mountains and deep gorges between China and Vietnam, which are extremely difficult to traverse, there is reason to believe the claim that the Japanese troops in the Tonkin area are "purely defensive in nature." Moreover, the war has proven over the past four years that the Chinese army has the ability to stop the Japanese army from advancing in this kind of mountainous terrain, which is enough to make the Japanese army hesitant to advance lightly. According to recent news from this area, the transport capacity of the Burma Road is now reaching its peak. Before the Japanese can transport materials to China on the Burma Road sufficient to compensate for the materials previously supplied by the Soviet Union, they may want to cut off the traffic on the Burma Road. Some people claim that if the Japanese want to fight on the plains of Thailand, they must use large vehicles, but if they move north into the mountainous areas, they must use fewer troops due to the difficulty of transport and supply. However, the Japanese may believe that their military strength is sufficient to meet their military needs. Perhaps Japan still does not want to take the final step and cause a total outbreak of war in the East. Undoubtedly, the Japanese have a strong intention to cut off the Yunnan-Burma Road within Chinese territory. (Reuters, 7th)

Chongqing - Unconfirmed reports today indicate that clashes have occurred 60 miles east of Lao Cai on the Yunnan-Vietnam border. Senior Chinese officials believe that a Japanese attack on the Yunnan-Burma Road would be the most serious and most important test for the ABCD anti-aggression front. However, foreign military experts here have differing views on whether Japan truly intends to strike the Yunnan-Burma Road. Unconfirmed reports claim that the border clashes involved dozens of soldiers, but there are no details. The Chinese side claims that the Japanese army has cleared the ground on the border in preparation for the placement of artillery. (Associated Press, 7th)

Chongqing - Colonel Sliney and another member of the U.S. Military Advisory Group traveled to Shaanxi at the beginning of the month and have visited Tongguan and other places to inspect the river defenses. The group leader, Major General Magruder, flew to Kunming this morning. This can be seen as the entry of the group's field work into a new stage. The movements of the Japanese army in Vietnam are still being closely monitored here, and at the same time, the defenses on the Yunnan-Vietnam border are constantly being strengthened. People close to the government have always believed that the Japanese aim to cut off the Yunnan-Burma Road, but they cannot predict when they will launch the attack because the information received by the government indicates that the Japanese army in Vietnam is not yet sufficient to use, and the air force is even weaker. It is difficult for them to launch an immediate attack. According to Senator Hang Liwu, he agrees with former Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui's observation that the Japanese army is very likely to attack Yunnan. However, he believes that if the Japanese do this, they will encounter immense difficulties. The treacherousness of the Yunnan-Vietnam Road is one aspect, and the fact that China is well prepared and that the United States will support the protection of the Yunnan-Burma transport to the extent possible makes Japan's every step fraught with thorns. (Havas, 6th)

The Tokyo Newspaper Hints That Japan Will Invade Yunnan

A newspaper in Tokyo, Japan, today published an article entitled "The Dangerous Highway," discussing Japan's initiative and stating that it is always possible, and perhaps even will happen, that the Japanese army will directly attack the Burma Road. The regular attacks by Japanese planes have greatly damaged the highway, but to achieve a permanent solution, it must be occupied. It also stated that if the Japanese army advances through Vietnam, the United States cannot object, because the United States itself also uses "intermediate routes" to supply Chongqing. (Reuters, 7th)

Japanese Planes Reconnoiter the Yunnan-Guizhou Border

According to news from Chongqing and Kunming, after a two-month hiatus, 23 Japanese planes suddenly appeared near the Yunnan-Guizhou border yesterday morning. After reconnaissance, they flew back to their base in Vietnam. In the afternoon, another eight Japanese planes, presumably flying from a base in northern Vietnam, flew through Guizhou Province to southern Hunan, reconnoitering Liling, Duyang, and Hengyang. No bombs were dropped on either occasion. (Reuters, 7th)

### Speech by Soviet Leader Stalin: Reaffirms Determination to Crush Nazis, Gains Stronger Belief in Victory with Aid from Britain and America, Confident that a Second Front Will Be Formed Soon

Moscow Dispatch from TASS, 7th: Chairman of the Defense Committee, Stalin, delivered a speech on November 6th at the celebration of the 24th anniversary of the Socialist October Revolution held by the Moscow City Soviet of Workers' Deputies, Party Organs, and Public Associations. The original text is as follows: "Comrades, it has been twenty-four years since the success of the Socialist October Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet regime in our country. We are now entering the twenty-fifth year of the Soviet regime. The achievements in commemorating the October Revolution in past years have not only increased year by year but have also grown month by month. As for what these achievements are and where their greatness lies, people from all sides, whether friend or foe, know it. However, last year, in addition to being a year of peaceful construction, was also a year of war against Germany, which perfidiously invaded our country. Last year, we were only able to engage in peaceful construction work in the first half of the year, and the latter half, four and a half months, was spent under intense war against Germany. This war has become a turning point in the development of our country. Our peaceful construction work has been sharply reduced, and in some aspects, it has been completely suspended due to the war. We have therefore been forced to reorganize various tasks to meet the needs of the war. We have become a vast rear force serving the front and our Red Army and Navy. The stage of peaceful construction has come to an end, and the stage of the free war against the German aggressors has begun. Therefore, we must now ask ourselves, what were the results of the war in the latter half of last year, or four and a half months? At the same time, what are the tasks we should shoulder in this war of liberation? Regarding the course of the war in the past four months, I have clearly stated in a speech at the beginning of the war that danger is threatening our country. We must understand this point and reorganize various tasks to meet the needs of the war. Currently, as we calculate the results of the four months of war, I must point out that these threats have not only not weakened but have increased. The enemy has occupied a large part of Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and other regions. The enemy has broken into the Donets Basin and is threatening Leningrad and our glorious capital, Moscow. The German fascists are plundering our country and destroying the villages and towns built by the joint efforts of our working masses, farmers, and cultural figures. Our army and navy soldiers defend the honor and freedom of the motherland, causing the enemy to bleed like a river. They courageously repel the enemy's fierce attacks and repeatedly establish heroic achievements, but the enemy, regardless of losses, spares no soldiers' blood and continues to drive fresh troops to the front to fill the ranks of the fallen soldiers, making a desperate gamble with all their strength, hoping to conquer Leningrad and Moscow before the arrival of severe cold, as they know that winter will be unfavorable to them."

Great Achievements in Four Months of War: German Casualties Exceed Four Million

"In the four months of war, our side suffered 350,000 deaths, 378,000 missing, and 1,020,000 wounded. During the same period, the enemy suffered 4,500,000 deaths, injuries, and missing. Undoubtedly, after four months of war, the rate of decline in German reserve manpower is more severe than that of the Soviet Union. When they first attacked our country, the German fascist aggressors believed that they could "end" the Soviet Union in one and a half to two months and reach the Urals in this short period. The German side did not shy away from its plan for a "lightning victory" over the Soviet Union. Currently, this insane plan must be considered a complete failure. The "blitzkrieg" that was invincible in Western Europe has collapsed on the Eastern Front. Why is this so? At the same time, what was the basis for the German fascist strategists claiming that they could "end" the Soviet Union and reach the Urals in two months? Their estimate was primarily based on the dream of forming an anti-Soviet alliance and enticing Britain and America to join. The method was to first intimidate the rulers of those countries with the "revolutionary devil" to prevent them from approaching the Soviet Union and isolate the Soviet Union. The German side is good at exploiting the contradictions between various countries and various classes, as well as the contradictions between various countries and the Soviet Union. They know that this policy has been effective in France because the French rulers have been frightened by the "revolutionary devil" and are willing to place their country under Hitler's iron heel. The German fascist strategists believed that they could apply the same trick to Britain and America."

Britain, America, and the Soviet Union Establish a United Front: Alienation Strategy Becomes Increasingly Futile

"Hess was sent to Britain by the German fascist regime with the aim of enticing British politicians to participate in the war against the Soviet Union. However, Germany's estimate was completely wrong. Although Hess has done his best, Britain and America have not only not joined hands with the fascist aggressors to attack the Soviet Union, but have united with us to deal with Hitler's Germany. At the same time, the Soviet Union has not only not been isolated but has also gained allies from Britain, America, and several countries in the German-occupied areas. In fact, Germany's policy of exploiting others' contradictions has exhausted its tricks and is completely unsuitable for the new situation. Not only that, but this policy has also placed the German aggressors in a precarious situation. Under the new situation currently created by the war, the results of this policy will be contrary to what they expected. Secondly, Germany was unstable, believing that once the Red Army suffered heavy losses, the workers and peasants would clash, disturbances would occur everywhere, and the country would disintegrate, thus assisting Germany in smoothly reaching the Urals. However, in this regard, Germany has also miscalculated. The adversity encountered by the Red Army has not weakened but has strengthened the unity of the Soviet people. Not only that, but they have also turned all the nationalities of the Soviet Union into an indestructible military camp to assist the Red Army and Red Navy in combat."

The Soviet Union Fights for Justice: National Army and People are United and Consolidated

"The Soviet rear has never been as stable as it is now. If it were another country, after encountering territorial losses, it would be very likely unable to sustain itself and would be eliminated. Since the Soviet system has experienced such a major test and has made its rear even more stable, this system is obviously the most stable system. Finally, the German aggressors excessively trusted the weakness of the Red Army and Navy, believing that the German army and navy could defeat the Red Army in one fell swoop and directly enter our inland. However, in this regard, the enemy has also miscalculated. They have overestimated themselves and underestimated the strength of our army and navy. Undoubtedly, our army and navy have less experience. They have only been fighting for four and a half months, while the enemy has been fighting for two years. Although the morale of our army is higher than that of the German army because they are defending their motherland and fighting for justice. The German side is engaged in aggressive warfare, plundering other countries, and disregarding right and wrong. Undoubtedly, since our army is fighting for justice and defending the motherland, it will inevitably create heroes. On the other hand, the German army is now using plunder as its combat objective, and it will inevitably produce plunderers without any spirit. Secondly, the deeper the German army enters our inland, the farther it is from the German rear and the more difficult it is to fight in an unfavorable environment. Soviet guerrillas destroy the enemy's rear and shatter the enemy's confidence in consolidating its position. On the other hand, the Red Army has the support of the entire Soviet people, and there is no need to worry about the supply of manpower and materials. Our army is stronger than the German side expected, and the weakness of the German army is also unexpected by them. All this is due to this reason. In the defense of Leningrad and Moscow, our army destroyed thirty German divisions, thus producing new talents in the army, navy, and air force. They will inevitably become a trouble for the German army in the future. Undoubtedly, all this can predict the inevitable failure of Germany's "blitzkrieg strategy" on the Eastern Front."

Fighting Alone in Adversity: Hope for the Establishment of a Second Front

"In some respects, the Red Army is in an advantageous position, but it is also in an unfavorable situation. The reason why the Red Army is temporarily encountering adversity is because of the lack of a second front against Hitler in Europe. Currently, there are no British or American troops fighting against the German fascist troops on the European continent. Therefore, the German side does not need to disperse its forces to fight on both the eastern and western fronts simultaneously. In other words, since the German side believes that there is no worry in the West, it is attacking the Soviet Union with all its strength and uniting the forces of its allies. The current true situation is that the Soviet Union is independently waging a war of liberation against Germany, Finland, Romania, Italy, and Hungary, without receiving any military assistance from anyone. The German side has repeatedly boasted about its temporary achievements and has hyped up its army, saying that as far as the army of one country is concerned, Germany will definitely be able to defeat the Soviet Union. But in fact, such boasting is extremely empty, as Germany has now had to rely on the assistance of the armies of Finland, Romania, Italy, and Hungary, while the Red Army is still fighting alone."

"The lack of a second front in Europe has reduced the German army's concerns. There is no denying this. At the same time, if a second front can be built in Europe (we firmly believe that this will become a reality in the near future), then the Red Army's position will definitely improve and be unfavorable to Germany. There is also no doubt about this. In addition, another reason for our army's temporary adversity is the lack of tanks and aircraft. In modern warfare, it is very difficult for infantry to fight without the assistance of tanks and sufficient aircraft. In terms of quality, our air force is actually better than that of the German fascists. Several Soviet divisions have even won the honor of fearless warriors, but their quantity is not as large as that of the German side. As for our tank units, although they also surpass the enemy in terms of quality and combat, their quantity is several times less than that of the enemy. These are all secrets of Germany's temporary victory. However, our tank production has not decreased. Our tank manufacturing industry continues to supply the front with excellent tanks, but German tank production is several times higher than ours. The enemy is not only actively manufacturing tanks in its own country but also using factories in Czechoslovakia, Belgium, and France to accelerate production. If it were not for this, the Red Army would have already defeated the German army, because due to the courage of our resistance, the German army never dares to fight without tanks."

Comparing Hitler to a Cat and Napoleon to a Lion: A Band of Rogues Vying for Hegemony

"As for Hitler and Napoleon, we can compare them to a kitten and a lion. Napoleon fought against reactionary forces with advancing forces, while Hitler is using reactionary forces to fight against advancing forces. The people of Europe will definitely rise up against Hitler's hegemony. Only Hitler does not know this. Who does not believe that the Soviet Union, Britain, and America will provide the people of Europe with assistance and wage a war of liberation against Hitler's hegemony? Secondly, what is the situation in the German rear? The Hitler Party was able to gain the support of the German people because it claimed to eliminate the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles and restore Germany. However, after this problem was solved, the Hitler Party embarked on the path of imperialism and aggression against Europe and the Soviet Union, making the German people the enemy of the public. The attitude of the German people has now greatly changed. They oppose the war and deeply hope for an immediate end to the war. Not only the European rear but also the German mainland rear has formed a volcano that is about to erupt and bury Hitler's adventurers in it. Regarding this point, only Hitler's foolish followers do not know it. Finally, Britain, America, and the Soviet Union have formed a whole front and have decided to make the defeat of Hitler's imperialist elements the goal. Modern warfare is actually a motor war. The side with a higher motor production can win the victory. The total amount of motors in Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States is three times that of Germany. This is one of the main reasons for the inevitable defeat of Hitlerism."

Britain and America Provide Substantial Assistance to the Soviet Union: Join Hands to Carry Out the War of Liberation

"The recent Three-Power Conference in Moscow has decided to supply our country with tanks. As everyone knows, we have begun to receive assistance in tanks and aircraft. In addition, the United States has recently decided to lend the Soviet Union $1 billion. We dare to say that the alliance between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States is indeed well-deserved, and this alliance will continue to strengthen. Our first goal is to liberate our territory and people from the German fascist system. At the same time, we must assist the Slavic and other European peoples in their struggle for liberation against Hitler's tyranny so that they can regain their freedom of life and not be interfered with in their internal affairs by others. But in order to achieve this goal, the military strength of the German aggressors must be crushed. The German aggressors who broke into our country and attempted to enslave our people must be completely destroyed. But in order to implement this task, our army and navy must receive the assistance of the whole country. Therefore, our workers must supply the front with more tanks, aircraft, and artillery. Our farmers must supply the people and industry with various agricultural products and raw materials as much as possible. At the same time, our entire country and all Soviet nationalities must unite and carry out the war of liberation side by side with the army and navy, destroy the Hitler troops, and win freedom and honor for our country. This is our current task. We can and must complete it, because only by completing this task and defeating the enemy can we obtain lasting and true peace. For the liberation of all oppressed people and for the complete destruction of the German aggressors, we wish the friendship of all the nationalities of the Soviet Union to last forever, and may our Red Army and Navy live long, may our motherland live long, we are fighting a bloody battle for justice, and victory will belong to us."

U.S. State Department Announces $1 Billion Loan to the Soviet Union for Purchasing Military Supplies, Repayable in Ten Years, Interest-Free During the War

Washington Urgent Dispatch from the United Press, 7th: The State Department announced yesterday that the United States has lent the Soviet Union $1 billion. The State Department stated that President Roosevelt wrote to Stalin on October 30, agreeing to lend the Soviet Union $1 billion. Stalin replied on November 3, accepting and expressing his gratitude, stating, "This loan will greatly help us in our arduous resistance against our common enemy, the homicidal Hitlerism." The loan will not require interest or principal repayment during the war. Interest and principal repayment will only be required five years after the end of the war. Part of the loan will be paid in raw materials and goods. The State Department disclosed in President Roosevelt's letter to Stalin that U.S. military supplies have already been shipped to the Soviet Union in quantity. The loan can be repaid within ten years. It also stated that the United States is extremely grateful for the work done by Stalin and his staff during the Three-Power Conference in Moscow. The letter further solemnly stated, "The elements discussed at the conference will be implemented as much as possible within the scope of feasibility."

Soviet Revolution Anniversary: Pan Youxin Holds Tea Party, Chairman Chiang Personally Visits to Congratulate

Chongqing Dispatch, 7th: Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin held a tea party at the embassy at 11 a.m. on the 7th to entertain guests from various countries to celebrate the 24th anniversary of the October Revolution. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by Director Shang Zhen, personally visited the embassy at 10:30 a.m. to congratulate him. In addition, present were Chiang Kai-shek's political advisor Lattimore, British financial and economic delegation leader Niemeyer, U.S. anti-malaria group leader Haas, U.S. Ambassador Gauss, British Ambassador Kerr, Belgian Ambassador Guillaume, Australian Minister Eggleston, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Gan Naiguang, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Weizhi, Ma Chaojun, He Yingqin, Feng Yuxiang, Guo Taiqi, Chen Lifu, Sun Ke's representative Situ De, Cheng Qian, Xu Yongchang, Lu Chao, Zhang Jia'ao, Pan Gongzhan, Dong Xian'guang, He Guoguang, Wu Guozhen, Wang Pengsheng, Yang Jie, Guo Moruo, and more than 200 reporters from various countries. Ambassador Pan personally greeted the guests, and the hosts and guests were exceptionally happy.

Chongqing Dispatch from the Havas Agency, 7th: The Sino-Soviet Cultural Association will hold a commemorative meeting at 2 p.m. tomorrow to commemorate the 24th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, welcoming people from all walks of life to participate, and will screen movies to entertain the guests. The president of the association, Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, recently published an article entitled "Wishing the Soviet Union Victory in the War of Resistance" to celebrate. His strategy stated that the Chinese people can best understand and sympathize with the mood of the Soviet people in commemorating their National Day today. The Soviet Union, like China, stands on the front line of the anti-aggression camp. Soviet victory not only protects the survival and freedom of the Soviet people but also protects the survival and freedom of countless peace-loving and justice-minded people around the world. The Soviet Union's war of resistance is linked to the bright and dark future of the world. Therefore, in addition to congratulating the Soviet Union on its National Day today, we cannot but wish the Soviet Union victory in the war of resistance. But we must also understand that the wars in various places are now connected as one. Anti-aggression countries must coordinate the overall situation and kill the enemy. China's counter-offensive power has gradually grown and will be able to cooperate with the anti-aggression front and fulfill its greatest responsibility. Britain, after this cruel experience in the European war, will be able to take further joint action with the anti-aggression countries. The United States will also be able to strengthen its economic blockade against Japan while aiding the Soviet Union and give Japan a head-on blow at the appropriate time so that it cannot cooperate with the Axis powers' plan to echo each other from east to west.

Washington Dispatch from the Havas Agency, 7th: President Roosevelt recently sent a telegram to Soviet Central Executive Committee Chairman Kalinin, congratulating him on the 24th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. The text reads, "I firmly believe that the sacrifices of bravely resisting aggression will be achieved."

Editorial

### Expectations Before Price Controls are Implemented

For years, the citizens of Shanghai have suffered from the manipulations and hoarding, which is beyond description. Eventually, due to the special circumstances, it is necessary to expect the Shanghai Municipal Council, which is responsible for municipal affairs, to temporarily take on the responsibility of general administration, crack down on hoarding, regulate supply and demand, stabilize prices, stabilize people's livelihood, and achieve the ultimate goal of maintaining social security. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Council, following its usual legislative procedures, has obtained the approval of the Consular Body for new bylaws, which are expected to be implemented soon. According to newspaper reports, the Shanghai Municipal Council's measures in this regard will, at a minimum, include investigating the inventory of goods to be controlled, tracking their origins and destinations, and setting official retail prices, in order to clear the air of speculation, manipulation, hoarding, and profiteering, and prevent prices from soaring like a kite on a string. It is hoped that life will be stable for a while, and the international market can maintain its original function without collapsing.

However, the difficulty of administration lies not in obtaining the form, but in matching the name with the reality. Being able to benefit the majority of people is good governance; if the benefit is enjoyed by a few, and the burden is nominally borne by many, taking advantage of the situation for personal gain, then good governance becomes bad governance. Moreover, merchants are only interested in profit, and hoarders are only interested in goods; having seen the Shanghai Municipal Council's rice maintaining price stability in a stable market, and also seeing that when market prices rise or fall excessively, they are either concealed by those in the industry, or abandoned by those in the industry, concealment deprives the public of their supply, and abandonment deprives the procurement of its basis. Therefore, it is said that control should not allow for exceptions, and prices should not allow for discrepancies; the same item should have the same price everywhere, and different grades should have different values; if there is both the Shanghai Municipal Council's publicly sold rice and merchants' privately sold rice, and there is also rice of the same grade but different prices being sold together, then there is no wonder where the problems arise from. Moreover, within the various strata of Shanghai society, there are vaguely forces opposing the authorities, causing those who are law-abiding and content to be hesitant to step forward, and reporting is also useless. Dishonest merchants are adept at fraud, not only towards their customers, but also towards all parties, if they cannot transcend personal interests, and cannot overcome their personal desires and material lusts, who will not be tempted and deceived, and those who were originally intended to be cracked down on may even become their protectors, and those who were originally intended to seek the welfare of the people may instead cause the people to suffer, such inversions are common, but it is also because they are not clear-headed!

However, things cannot be generalized. Merchants who deeply understand the overall situation never consider the actions of unscrupulous merchants to be right, but are hindered by their business relationships and cannot take measures to clarify and correct. Therefore, we deeply hope that the implementation of this decision to control prices can obtain the cooperation of merchants in various industries who are discerning and fair, standing on the position of commercial ethics and proper business operations, so that price controls can achieve practical results without losing the profits they deserve in their business. However, the necessary understanding of price control: (1) For goods that supply foreign exchange, merchants must not be allowed to use the intangible black market rates of exchange, and speculative hoarding to set prices based on the market ratio of items such as US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, gold, and cotton yarn. But if such a black market still exists, the practice of speculation and manipulation cannot be eliminated, and the doctrine of profiteering will penetrate deep into people's hearts, inevitably causing the goods supplying foreign exchange to still be constrained by it, and become a major problem for people's livelihood. (2) Import merchants or manufacturers should directly sell goods to retail stores, and the quantity should be based on the average monthly sales of each store in recent months as a quota; then the amount of goods allocated should be proportional to the amount sold. In other words, retail stores should temporarily become consignment shops, and the original agency (or sales or contractor) contracts of various factories within the concession should be canceled, in order to achieve direct production (or importer) sales, eliminating the accumulation and manipulation of middlemen, or the gradual flow of goods into the hands of hoarders. (3) All store inventory, warehouse inventory, factory inventory, and hoarder inventory of each item before the implementation of control shall be registered with the Shanghai Municipal Council by the owners within the shortest possible time, and then the Shanghai Municipal Council shall separately prescribe its sales methods. Some may think that it would be appropriate for the Shanghai Municipal Council to directly purchase and sell them, but they do not consider that it is not appropriate for the Shanghai Municipal Council to directly bear the business responsibility of certain commodities, so as long as it supervises that there is no more manipulation and hoarding, restores normal transactions, and achieves free circulation, that is enough! As for concealing and failing to report, and rewarding whistleblowers, the Shanghai Municipal Council will naturally have its own methods, and there is no need to discuss it further. (4) Judging from the past commercial deceptions and concealments, it is really difficult to prevent the supplied goods from being hidden and exploited; because the accounting records often have discrepancies and are not entirely credible. If the market is calm, and prices in one place are consistent, and there is no profit to be made, then there is no need to use its malpractices. But in today's situation of soaring prices, if the restrictions are too strict, stores can use all kinds of malpractices to counteract them, or use counterfeit goods, or mix goods, or claim to have no goods, or sell to the most profitable channels, or change the retail unit, or change the measuring instruments. All of these will make consumers suffer unbearably, and have to reluctantly comply and collude to conceal. This makes it difficult for the government to crack down due to lack of justification, and difficult to intervene due to lack of evidence, eventually leading to de facto laissez-faire, and treating the laws as useless. (5) During the control period, all daily necessities are sold directly by manufacturers or importers to retail merchants, the market prices are uniform, and there are fixed rules for entry and exit, so there is no need for a spot market to discuss market conditions and circulate goods, trying to create a fait accompli, so that even if the Shanghai Municipal Council wants to suppress it, it will eventually be helpless. In fact, the Shanghai Municipal Council is determined to seek the welfare of the public, and will not tacitly approve the prices created by speculation and manipulation as natural or due. Currently, all kinds of prices are divorced from the actual sales effect, and are driven by the greedy ambitions of hoarders, as well as the instigation of the black market exchange rate and the black market gold price, using a small amount of materials and the competition of many people, holding back and not releasing, hyping it up and soaring wildly. The serious and profound suffering of the millions of wage earners in Shanghai is all due to this, how can it be regarded as a normal market price. How can the Shanghai Municipal Council be ignorant of this situation, how can it enter its trap and use it as the base price for the official price, there is absolutely no reason for this. We believe that the most fair and just method for the Shanghai Municipal Council to set prices this time is: 1. Based on the Shanghai prices before the United States and Britain implemented the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds. 2. Based on the price calculated from the foreign exchange supply. The Stabilization Fund recognizes that some cases can be considered for the number of foreign exchange applications for the import of essential goods before August 18 that have not been approved, and even supplements the necessary subsidies to maintain trade. From this, it can be seen that the price regulation in Shanghai should use this as the standard, there is no need to doubt it; if it is the opposite, then there is reason to suspect it. (7) The sale of daily necessities must be based on the principle of universal application; once the purchase quantity is restricted, it should not be restricted by time, location, and availability of goods (this is naturally a separate matter in extreme situations where goods are absolutely scarce). If the method of sale is not good, it will originally be intended to suppress and stabilize people's minds, but it will instead promote panic. Recently, the sale of publicly sold rice in various rice stores, this store today, that store tomorrow, there are many who seek it, but few who respond, the more difficult it is to obtain, the more those who want to obtain it become eager. As a result, as soon as the public hears that there is publicly sold rice for sale, thousands of people gather, squeezing and falling, whipping and kicking, willing to endure the pain to wait, and finally return empty-handed. The peddlers who take advantage of the situation for profit are not worth regretting, but every household is waiting to be fed and cannot obtain it, it is truly pitiful. As for how to crack down on concealing and reselling, that is another matter, it is not possible to prevent its malpractices by tightening the purchase quantity of each person; and "sold out" cannot be considered as fulfilling its responsibility. (8) Therefore, the distribution system is the most complex; it may work well elsewhere, but it cannot be implemented in Shanghai; because Shanghai has neither the preparation nor the conditions for this. But the Shanghai Municipal Council should know that the community is diverse, the strata are uneven; the living standards are different, the purchasing power is very different, and the number of family members varies. In the past, Tao Yuanming bowed for five dou of rice, but now it is not easy to get five dou of publicly sold rice, it is not that the people of today and the past are different; the environment is different, and the pressure of life is truly lamentable. Therefore, the sale of daily necessities is beneficial to disperse, not to concentrate, and convenient for the needs of the public. In the past, running a charity sale was not for the purpose of making profit, changing the low selling price, compensating for labor costs, although the quantity was limited, still a dozen or twenty places were set up throughout the city to facilitate trade, how thoughtful was its intention. Now the public sale of rice is not as charitable as that, it is priced according to its cost, there is no reduction, and those who sell it, the merchants profit, the rice shops profit, and it is sold to the households, it is still a normal transaction. Therefore, the government supplies foreign exchange in order to maintain the food supply of the entire Shanghai, and there should be an appropriate supply to meet the eager demand of the public. How can the public be made to give up what they want and seek what they do not want, pay an unreasonable price, and maintain their rightful survival. Therefore, the technical aspects of the public sale of rice should not be used as a basis for preventing peddlers, nor should it be abandoned due to choking, and not plan to improve it. Regardless of what kind of daily necessities, it is appropriate to measure its nature, plan its sales method, and in general, it should adapt to the purpose of the appropriate survival of consumers, plan its application convenience, and not allow insiders and outsiders to hoard it away. However, in today's soaring prices, importers may not be stained, manufacturers may not all benefit, wholesalers may not all be profitable, and the benefits are all taken by the hoarders and large and small retail wholesalers! Leaving aside paper cigarettes, matches, and soap, gasoline is 5.2 yuan per gallon, and kerosene is 11 yuan per gallon on the market. In terms of quality, kerosene is inferior to gasoline; in terms of need, gasoline is far less universal than kerosene; however, the price of kerosene is twice that of gasoline, and even more. One is that import companies manage it themselves (but there is also a black market), and the other is that merchants and hoarders are allowed to set the price themselves. Oil is oil, kerosene is a mass fuel, its high market price is ignored, this is why the strictness is different, probably because kerosene is exclusively for the use of the general public, and the calls are not easily heard by the foreign companies. But wool mills and rubber factories have already publicly expressed their adjustment of sales prices, hoping not to be manipulated by hoarders. If this is a semi-finished product, it should also take into account the output of processing and manufacturing, (1) can we not be manipulated by the manufacturers; (2) even if the manufacturers are not manipulated, can we not be hoarded by agents and retailers, and consumers cannot benefit from it. In order for price controls to be effective, both governance and people management are needed, so the organization of investigation and audit must be strict; it should be valued for its execution with a spirit of meticulousness, sharpness, rigor, fairness, familiarity with commercial conditions and people's suffering, not being emotionally driven, nor being swayed by power, but also having human sympathy, so that it can truly feel the pain of the people and wholeheartedly seek the welfare of the people.

Now, before the implementation of price control, we express our sincere expectations, and hope that it can live up to the people's fervent expectations.

### Japanese Special Envoy Kurusu Arrives in Manila, Discusses Mission to the United States, Aims to Promote Peace, Kurusu Also Visits American and Filipino Dignitaries

Reuters, Manila, 7th - Saburo Kurusu, the Japanese special envoy to Washington, arrived in Cavite this afternoon, welcomed by the Japanese Consul General Niina and other Japanese representatives. President Quezon's representative, Benitez, was also present. After a brief rest at a hotel in Manila, Kurusu officially visited President Quezon. He then returned to the hotel to meet with reporters, saying that both US Secretary of State Hull and he agreed that the less said about US-Japan relations at the moment, the better. A reporter asked if he had brought a letter to President Roosevelt. Kurusu replied that he was not a messenger, and if one letter was enough, why send another envoy? The sole purpose of this trip is to assist Ambassador Nomura in the United States. Kurusu also said that he and Hull had reached an agreement on one point, but he would not disclose anything about it at this time. When reporters asked him to talk about other points, Kurusu replied that he did not know, and that it had to be discovered in Washington, not in the Philippines. Reporters continued to ask questions. Kurusu replied that he was going to the United States on a special mission, not to fight, but to assist Ambassador Nomura. Ambassadors always have their missions, and the work of an ambassador is to promote peace. Kurusu also announced that he had flown from Taiwan to Macau on a military plane, and from there took a ship to Hong Kong, and then immediately took the clipper ship here. After entertaining reporters, he held a tea party, attended by the US representative to the Philippines, Sayre, the US Navy Commander-in-Chief in the Far East, Hart, Philippine President Osmena, and prominent American, Filipino, and Japanese figures. Kurusu had a pleasant conversation with Sayre and Hart. Kurusu will take a clipper ship to San Francisco at dawn tomorrow.

United Press, Tokyo, 7th - It is learned here that Yuki, the chief of the Third Section of the Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is accompanying Kurusu to Washington. It is said that both Kurusu and Yuki are among the most outstanding experts in the Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so their trip may focus on restoring normal trade relations between the United States and Japan.

### Another Japanese Ship Sinks off Vladivostok, Soviet Mines Floating, Endangering Navigation, Japan Sees it as an Extremely Serious Issue

Reuters, Tokyo, 7th - According to a report from the Hokkaido office of the Japanese News Agency, the Hakune Maru (3,000 tons) sank last night near Cape Kamui, opposite Vladivostok, but the cause of the accident was not specified. It is now known that 17 people died, 5 are missing, and 14 were rescued. This is the second Japanese ship to be involved in an accident in two days. According to a message received by the Governor-General of Korea at 1:00 PM today, 110 people are still missing after the "Kehi Maru" sank after hitting a mine two days ago. It is reported that a total of 281 people were rescued, but 20 of them have already died. When Navy Minister Shimada reported on the circumstances of the sinking of the "Kehi Maru" to the Cabinet, he said that from August to October 4, Japanese naval patrol boats had discovered 69 Soviet-made floating mines in one area of Korean territorial waters.

Reuters, Tokyo, 7th - When Foreign Office spokesman Ishii received foreign journalists this morning, he was asked about the sinking of the Japanese ship "Kehi Maru" off the coast of Korea after hitting a floating mine. Ishii claimed that Japan's patience was almost exhausted. We do not trust the sincerity of the Soviet Union, or that the Soviet Union wishes to be friendly to Japan, but we are now doubtful of its sincerity regarding the floating of mines due to Soviet carelessness. Japan has now taken all kinds of actions that have been discussed regarding this case. He meant that the United States would also support Japan in terms of the principle of freedom of the seas. When asked if Japan sincerely supported this principle, Ishii firmly replied of course. Ishii also said that the Soviet Union has continued to try to curb the danger of mines, but in view of the situation, it is still necessary to take the necessary precautions.

### Hong Kong Implements New Regulations to Stabilize Legal Tender, Legal Tender Transactions Suspended This Morning, Gold and Silver Exchange Holds Emergency Meeting

Hong Kong - As a result of the implementation of the new foreign exchange policy, trading in Chinese legal tender was completely suspended this morning. There were no transactions on the black market. The Hong Kong Gold and Silver Exchange, which has always traded legal tender, opened its doors this afternoon to consider everything. Although the authorities have not yet issued an order to close the exchange, according to well-informed sources, forward trading of legal tender must be conducted according to official prices, and the black market will automatically disappear. After the authorities announced the buying price of legal tender as 473 yuan and the selling price as 469 yuan, the market was quite chaotic for a while, because there is a huge amount of legal tender in Hong Kong. Now, anyone who wants to exchange legal tender must first obtain a permit from the Stabilization Fund. The Stabilization Fund must verify that it is for genuine commercial use, not for speculation, before issuing the permit. (Reuters, 7th)

Hong Kong - After the Foreign Exchange Control Office announced the new regulations on the holding of legal tender and foreign exchange transactions last night, the black market for legal tender here was closed this morning. According to the new regulations, the following three types of activities are illegal: (1) Any foreign exchange transaction involving legal tender without a permit; (2) Buying or selling goods in Hong Kong with legal tender without a permit; (3) Holding, obtaining, paying, importing, or exporting legal tender without a permit, except for authorized or registered banks (Chinese and foreign banks and major money shops) which may engage in foreign exchange transactions. All foreign exchange transactions such as telegraphic transfers or drafts must be subject to the official exchange rate of 473 yuan for buying and 469 yuan for selling. If a business currently has more than 20,000 yuan in legal tender, or an individual has more than 5,000 yuan, and registers before November 14, they will be allowed to hold, obtain, pay, export, or import legal tender. A statement issued by the Hong Kong government stated that in order to dispel public anxiety about the free use of legal tender, it has been suggested that before the situation is adjusted, applications for the export of legal tender will be approved without questioning, and that the extraction of up to 1,000 yuan of legal tender per month from legal tender accounts will be allowed without a permit. These new regulations were promulgated in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance of the Chinese government and the Stabilization Fund, and can assist in the implementation of the Chinese government's monetary policy. (Reuters, 7th)

Hong Kong - Financial Secretary Gu Yiqun issued a statement today regarding the new regulations adopted by the Hong Kong government on legal tender exchanges: The adoption of this regulation is in cooperation with the National Government to help maintain the stability of legal tender, and is the result of close and harmonious cooperation between the two governments, but various considerations should be given to the legitimate needs of banks, trade interests, and holders of small amounts of legal tender. The National Government welcomes this regulation, which makes a significant contribution to the implementation of China's monetary policy. (Reuters, 7th)

### Speculation in Yarn and Cloth Fluctuates Greatly, Margin Requirements Will be Increased Due to Increased Volatility, Extra Yarn Delivery is Relaxed Due to Excessive Squeezing

The yarn market has seen a turnaround, due to the decline in gold prices, public apathy, and profit-taking by bulls across the board, so the market has become more relaxed. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse factory singles fell by 30 yuan to 3,120 yuan, but the securities firms rushed to the market to sell, which made the market more bearish. At the same time, futures also fell, leading the cloth to return downstream, so floating positions became more active, and the market gradually fell to 3,025 yuan. However, as soon as the low price appeared, certain major players were unwilling to give up on the bulls, and bought in at the low price, gradually rising to 3,080 yuan, but gold remained weak, and was still weak at the close, with a price of 3,025 yuan. The trading situation was quite lively.

The current yarn situation opened weak following the factory singles, and prices fell uniformly. However, buyers of 10-count coarse yarn were very enthusiastic, and the market became firm instead. It is unknown why general hoarders do not buy fine yarn, but only absorb coarse yarn, so the recent situation is that coarse yarn is tight and fine yarn is loose. The trading volume in half a day was only 380 bales, with prices down 20-30 yuan for coarse yarn, and 80-90 yuan for fine yarn.

The market was quite weak in the afternoon, saying that gold continued to fall, futures yarn fell, and the leading cloth also softened, so public sentiment was depressed, and it is expected that the opening will be low today.

The Double Horse Exchange Office convened a liaison meeting with the industry yesterday afternoon, and intended to expand the scope of business. Since the previous repeated limit-up and limit-down, there have been too many. Now it is thought that the policy should be changed, and all 23-count and 20-count packaging produced by all factories in Shanghai will be uniformly graded and can be delivered. In this way, it can avoid squeezing the shorts and squeezing the longs. If the review is completed, trading will be carried out as usual next Monday.

Since the 20-count Double Horse yarn and factory single speculative market has been suspended for more than a week since the repeated limit-down and the settlement price of 2,370 yuan between the long and short sides, the reporter has learned that the Yarn Guild Broker Exchange Conference has decided to reopen next Monday (November 10). The limit-down and limit-up will be 160 yuan per piece of yarn (double the standard of 80 yuan before the settlement price). The black market has already posted a black board, notifying the industry and customers. And the banks in the Securities Building will also double the margin for each customer's speculative transaction of cotton yarn (originally only 100 yuan per bale, then changed to 200 yuan, and now it must be 400 yuan) to avoid risk. However, future speculative customers will have to double their capital, and the number of speculators will be reduced compared to before, and the cotton yarn chips for speculative targets may be wider than before. The interest of speculators has been reduced. However, future speculative factory single trading is truly doable and not doable. (Komatsu)

The Jin Double Horse futures market went from flat to down, with a sudden and fierce decline. Since the new contract, the market price has soared greatly, and general buyers have made a profit at this new peak. In addition, the news from abroad is more moderate, and the gold market has fallen sharply, once entering the 20,000 yuan mark, so the yarn market is weak, and there is a lot of profit-taking, and mixed yarns are also weak, resulting in a situation of oversupply. The opening of October was still firm at 3,030 yuan, up 5 yuan slightly. Later, due to the decline in cash, it also turned weak. The December contract was 3,050 yuan, down 50 yuan. The January contract was 3,140 yuan, down 38 yuan. After entering, there was no return. The closing price was down 60-70 yuan to nearly 100 yuan. The market was still threatened by sellers in the afternoon, and the trend was very weak, so it continued to fall one after another. The near-term contract once fell to 2,828 yuan, the December contract also fell to a low of 2,940 yuan, and the January contract fell slightly to a low price of 3,050 yuan. Later, due to a slight replenishment of floating positions, it rebounded slightly. The result was a uniform drop of 120-130 yuan to 196 yuan. A list is shown below:

Coarse and Fine Cotton Flannel Markets Differ in Condition

The current cotton situation has loosened along with the gold price, but fine cotton flannel is still firm, and coarse cotton flannel is slightly inferior.

Brazil 100 pieces 1350.0 Public Great Advance

Also 100 pieces 1298.0 Colleague Advance

Also 100 pieces 1330.0 Also

Also 300 pieces 1280.0 Also

Rangoon 100 pieces 730.0 Also

Also 100 pieces 726.0 Also

Also 100 pieces 720.0 Also

Also 100 pieces 714.0 Also

The New York cotton market was unstable and sporadic, rising first due to buying by the industry and short covering, then falling back due to continuous selling by Southern parties and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, the closing price, except for the spot price, which rose by 2 points per pound, fell by 5-6 points per pound.

The Indian cotton market rose first due to lower cotton crop estimates and large short covering, and then fell again due to sales by European exporters and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, yesterday's closing price still rose by about 1-2 rupees. It is also predicted that the market will open lower by half a rupee today.

### Coarse and Fine Cloth Each Fall by 10 Yuan

Factory cloth continued to weaken, due to profit-taking by colleagues and hoarders. However, the market rebounded slightly later. As a result, white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill fell by 2-5 yuan. The factory prices of bleached and dyed cloth remained unchanged, and hand goods fell by 3-5 yuan. 16-pound Butterfly, a variant of coarse cloth, fell by as much as 10 yuan. The trading volume in this street alone was large, totaling more than 500 pieces.

Eastern cloth showed signs of weakness at the opening, but rose after falling due to the firm rise in gold prices. Ultimately, the selling pressure from the industry was strong, and the decline continued. The leading fine cloth factory singles opened in the morning at 118 yuan, and fell to 115 yuan. The smallest price in the afternoon was 108 yuan, and the closing price was slightly higher at 114 yuan, a sharp drop of about 10 yuan per piece compared to the previous day. Sijunzi Chibi closed late at 3.97 yuan, also a terrible drop of 2 cents per yard.

### The Market for Small Package Rice Declines Significantly

The imported rice market, after a brief rebound earlier, has weakened again due to sluggish sales. Speculative trading has become difficult, relying solely on actual sales for support. Early market trading saw buyers seeking to offload holdings due to poor sales, but sellers were initially reluctant to lower prices, buoyed by the previous day's momentum. The market remained relatively stable, with No. 1 Saigon rice opening at $195.50 and $195, No. 2 at $185, and Java rice at $190. No. 2 Siam rice was particularly strong due to dwindling supply. Many shops, concerned about counterfeit small package rice from the Public Works Department (PWD) sales, switched to other varieties, making No. 2 Siam rice the most sought-after medium-grade option. It opened at $175-176, then $173.50. Small package rice opened at $165-166. However, due to weak sales, the market could not sustain the initial prices, and all grades gradually declined. Closing prices were as follows: No. 1 Saigon at $192, Medium Grade at $189, No. 2 at $182-$180, No. 1 Siam initially at $190, then down to $185, No. 2 at $175, Java Long Grain at $187-$188, Min-to initially at $186-$187, Medium Grade at $182, then down to $179, Broken Rice initially at $137-$138, then down to $133, all down by $2-$3 from the previous day. Small package rice, with practically no sales and no speculative interest, suffered a sharp decline, closing at $160-$159, a drop of $6-$7, a truly significant event.

The Yinghua Company (1 picul 2.5 pecks) fine-grain rice also fell by $2-$3, from $200 to $197-$198. 13,000 bags of spot goods were traded, along with 400-500 tons from the Yinghua Company. The overall market trend was downward, influenced by sales from hoarders and the continuous arrival of cheap small package rice in Shanghai. More shipments are expected soon, and new deals are being negotiated. Coupled with bearish rumors, the future prospects appear bleak.

Due to scarce arrivals, thick and thin glutinous rice varieties saw limited sales volume but firm selling intentions from owners, resulting in a price increase of $2-$3. Early Southern Port rice broke $205, then down to $202. Kunshan new glutinous rice was at $206, special grade at $208-$209, Qingjiao kiln seed rice at $104-$105, Six Species at $206, and Dujian at $190.

The supply and demand for glutinous rice remained balanced, showing no significant ups or downs. Hong Kong glutinous rice initially opened at $220, then down to $218, special grade at $222, green glutinous rice at $204-$205, Jindan New National rice at $209, and Qingjiao New Shade rice at $197.

### The Market for Imported Flour Gradually Weakens

The imported flour market remained weak. The fall in rice prices has dampened speculative interest, and the PWD's public sale of cheap flour is also being planned. As a result, street sales are slow, and speculative hoarding is limited. Off-market trading is sluggish with little activity. Kan Flour's Golden Dragon brand was once offered at $57 but found no takers, later offered at $56 but still with poor sales. Consequently, prices are down by $1.50 from the previous market. Wheat bran prices are stable, with wheat arrivals scarce and prices firm.

### Reduced Off-Market Trading in Miscellaneous Grains

Yesterday's off-market trading in miscellaneous grains decreased slightly due to sluggish actual sales and limited buyer interest, causing the market to soften. Da You Factory clear oil was reportedly sold at $280, rapeseed oil at $273, Ri Hua Factory rapeseed oil at $270, Tai Shan Factory rapeseed oil at $267, Changzhou Cowhide Yellow at $109.50, Dutch Yellow Corn at $50.05, white corn at $48, Saigon new corn for October shipment at $95.50-$95, and for November shipment at $95.

### Gold Prices Soar Excessively, Triggering a Sell-Off from Tianjin Dealers, Resulting in a Sharp Drop of Over $1,700

Yesterday, the black market for spot gold bullion experienced a dramatic plunge, with prices breaking below the $20,000 threshold. Market sentiment was uniformly bearish, primarily because the recent surge in prices had been excessive, exceeding Hong Kong gold prices by over $3,000 and Tianjin gold prices by an even greater margin. Tianjin dealers had already shipped 4,200 taels to Shanghai the day before, which securities firms heavily sold. Some cash shops and banks also actively sold, while other banks continued to acquire gold, temporarily pushing prices up to $21,100. However, the market soon reverted to a selling trend, and after hitting a low of $19,200, it entered a consolidation phase, ultimately falling by $1,710. Over 10,000 taels were traded throughout the day. Jewelry gold also fell by $150 to $2,020. Silver shops resumed posting prices for standard silver at $28, a rise of $6. Today, Saturday, the Shanghai Joint Exchange Market will open at 9:00 AM and close at 10:30 AM to facilitate cash settlement for members.

Spot Gold Breaks Below $20,000 Threshold

The spot gold bullion market opened with a uniform selling pressure, with buyers hesitant to enter. As a result, the opening price was already down by $810, at $20,600. Tian Yuan and Shun Yuan advanced and recovered to $900. Heng Ji, De Fu, and Da Feng sold, sharply falling $450 to $20,450. Ming Feng and others suddenly started buying, and Tian Yuan also bought, pushing the price up $650 to $21,100. Tianjin dealers then began a massive sell-off, and De Fu and others also sold, creating a severe market imbalance. Prices plummeted $1,400 to $19,700. Ming Feng returned with aggressive buying, and Da Feng and others also absorbed supply, causing an immediate surge of $750, reaching $20,450. At noon, Tian Yuan sold off, causing another decline, with the noon close at $20,100. In the afternoon, buyers were hesitant, and the market opened $900 lower at $19,200 due to continued selling pressure. De Cheng and Yong Cheng aggressively bought, causing a surge of $600, and Cheng Ji and others sold off to $19,500. Xiang He and De Fu then aggressively bought again, pushing the price up to $19,950. Heng Ji and others sold off, pushing it back down to $19,500. Shi He and Da Feng then absorbed supply, raising the price to $19,850. Tian Yuan sold off, with the closing price at $19,700, a sharp drop of $1,710 compared to the previous day's closing price. There was a $1,900 range throughout the day. The retail price for gold bullion at cash shops was around $20,000, with the buying price being $1,000 lower than the selling price.

Jewelry Gold Down $150

Jewelry gold retail prices were lowered three times in the morning by Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, down by $120. In the afternoon, it was lowered by another $30 to $2,020 (buying price reduced by $150), a total decrease of $150.

### New York Telegraphic Transfers: Numerous Sellers Seeking $4, Pound Sterling Plummets by $40

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw both the Central Bank and HSBC posting stable rates. Black market rates for British and American currencies remained slightly weaker, owing to renewed rumors of unrest between China and Japan. The British pound was offered outside the customs area at 2 shillings, and a Chinese speculator sold thousands of pounds to an importing firm at 2 shillings 1.25 pence. There were numerous sellers of Chinese currency at $2.875, while importing firms offered $3 and $3.25. Numerous sellers sought $4 for New York telegraphic transfers, as these funds were reportedly frozen upon arrival in New York. The market softened further at noon, then quieted down again in the afternoon. The closing rates at 4:00 PM were 2 shillings for the British pound and $3 for the American dollar, slightly weaker than the previous day.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the British and American gold pounds plummet by $40, following the sharp drop in spot gold prices. British gold notes also fell by $3. American gold notes re-entered the $40 range, briefly falling to $38.70 before recovering to $39.30, but still down $1 from the previous day. Hong Kong notes fell sharply by $0.50. Japanese and Korean gold notes also weakened, with the former falling to $3.88 and the latter to $3.79.

### Slight Increase in Domestic Debt

The off-market trading of government bonds was firmer yesterday, mainly due to short covering following the fall in gold and cotton yarn prices, leading to stronger market sentiment. Class C bonds even broke the $6 mark, but selling by Sichuan dealers in the afternoon dampened enthusiasm. However, if Sichuan dealers do not continue to sell, it is unlikely to see a downtrend in the near term. Class D bonds are scheduled for the twelfth drawing on the 10th, so the market will be ex-lottery from today. In the morning, Xin Feng, Lian Yi, and Sheng Xing were buyers, while Tong Kang, Tong Shun, Sen Chang, Lian He, and Jiu Feng were sellers. Class C bonds briefly reached $6, then recovered. In the afternoon, sentiment was quite positive, with Xie Xing, Yuan Shun, Tai Ding Kang covering positions, and Run De and Yi Chang also buying. Class C bonds reached a high of $62.50, then experienced selling by Sichuan dealers, with Bao Long, Tong Kang, Tong Shun, and Jiu Feng continuing to sell. The market was slightly weaker at closing, with prices generally rebounding by $0.03 to $0.07. Approximately $1.8 million worth of bonds were traded. A summary table is provided below.

Two hundred shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded at $170 each.

The stock market at the General Chamber of Commerce continued to be lively, with new prices appearing amidst strong buying pressure. The market softened slightly at the close. Yarn mill stocks were no longer the focus of attention and are unlikely to remain strong, likely due to excessive gains in previous days. Rubber stocks saw increased buyer interest, with high prices difficult to secure. Although prices also retreated slightly at the close, most prices remained significantly higher than the previous close.

### The Price of Sugar is About to Decline, When a New Horder Buys

The sugar market in the morning continued to fall due to excessive floats and some market sentiment favoring the shorts, so the decline was even more severe. In the afternoon, new hoarders took advantage of the low prices to absorb the goods, and the prices recovered. The company's futures for 24 Raw White were at the $293 limit down in the morning. In the afternoon, the market opened at $275, closed at $84, with a high of $91 and a low of $73. The 20th date opened at the $301 limit up in the morning. In the afternoon, the market opened at $315 and closed at $26, with a high of $30 and a low of $15, a fall of $32 to $13. Spot goods for 24 Raw White for October delivery were initially at $306, then suddenly fell to $280, then to $95. In the afternoon, the price rose to $312 due to multi-party absorption, slightly down to $01 in the middle, and then rose again to $20, and then down to $05. September was at $280 to $315, down $09. August was at $275 to $310, down $11. July was at $275 to $300, down $10. Hong Kong Raw White fell sharply to $260 in the morning, and recovered by $20 in the afternoon to $2780, which was still $9.50 lower than the previous day. Dutch Red was at $238 to $65, down $05. Taikoo car White B Mark was at $200, and $315 in the afternoon, up $05. HX Mark was at $280, $300, up $15. A total of more than 38,000 packages of futures were traded, and more than 29,000 packages of spot goods.

### Continued Rise in Dried Seafood

The price of Ningbo seafood, dried cuttlefish and dried octopus, has continued to rise recently. Goods from Zhoushan have reached $550, Yantai goods at $540, Ningbo goods at $360, and dried Ningzi at $800.

### Chestnuts (Continued from October 13th)

— Gao Jiannong

There are probably not many discussions and records about eating chestnuts before the Tang and Song Dynasties. Du Fu's poem has a sentence "Steamed Chestnuts Warm in Mountain Homes"; Tao Gu, a person from the early Song Dynasty, also said in the Qing Yi Lu he wrote: "Prince Jin - Li Keyong - once pursued the Bian army fiercely, - Zhu Quanzhong's soldiers - the grain transport was endless, steamed chestnuts to eat: the army then called the ticket Hedong grain." From this, we can know that people in the Tang Dynasty would eat "steamed chestnuts". Mei Yaochen of the Song Dynasty, Yin Yang Wei Geng Chuanhui's poem about new chestnuts, has a sentence "Wild people meet in cold study, mountain stove night fire artillery": probably putting chestnuts in the stove to burn them, just like the "pop chestnuts" we call now. The real way to eat "fried chestnuts" also originated in the Song Dynasty. Lu You's Notes from an Old Scholar's Studio said: "The former capital - Bianjing - Li He fried (same as stir-fried) chestnuts, and was famous in all directions. Others tried every means to imitate it, but in the end they could not match it. In Shao Yu, Chen Fugong... was sent as an envoy to Yanshan, and suddenly two people came to offer ten bundles of fried chestnuts each... they praised themselves and said: "Li He's son!" Shed tears and left." He also has a poem Feeling about Eating Fried Chestnuts at Night "The roots of the teeth are floating and sighing at my decline, mountain chestnuts are fired to heal night hunger", which can also prove this statement (to be continued)

### Shanghai Food Rice and Foreign Exchange Lending; Monthly Supply of 250,000 Bags; Total Value Approximates 40 Million National Currency; Monthly Foreign Exchange Allocation of US$1 Million for Coal

Mobil Kerosene Temporarily Suspended Sales Due to Speculation by Resellers

Regarding the matters of Public Works Department Chairman Riddell and American Director Missler going to Hong Kong to negotiate the foreign exchange needed for imported goods, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from authoritative sources yesterday that the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee is extremely concerned about the food situation of Shanghai citizens. It has now been decided to provide a maximum of 25,000 tons per month, i.e., the foreign exchange needed for the import of 250,000 bags of rice, with a total value of approximately US$2 million. Calculated at the Exchange Equalization Fund's rate of 5.34375, the amount is close to 40 million National Currency. Therefore, the food situation of Shanghai citizens can be considered stable in the future, and its prospects are becoming brighter. As for the foreign exchange needed for the import of flour, wheat, and coal, the two representatives of the Public Works Department are discussing it with the Exchange Equalization Fund. It is reported that there is hope for a monthly allocation of US$1 million for coal.

Flat Rice Sales Points Set Up Inside Police Stations

It is now known that the French Concession authorities have reiterated their previous order that anyone who does not have a special permit from the police department is not allowed to transport rice out of the Concession. However, this ban does not apply to rice heading to the Public Concession. If anyone is found to have violated this ban, the French police department will immediately confiscate the rice. Furthermore, according to a report from the Dazhong News Agency from responsible sources yesterday, regarding the Public Works Department setting up two flat-price Hong Kong rice sales points to facilitate purchases by citizens, it is now actively underway. Public Works Department Director-General Frelippe met with two qualified rice merchants yesterday who had applied to the Public Works Department to be responsible for the rice sales and inquired about everything. If everything goes smoothly, it is hoped that it will be established and start selling rice next Monday. It is heard that the location will be temporarily assumed by the police station within the Public Concession, but this statement has not been confirmed by the authorities. The Public Works Department is also scheduled to hold a flour flat-price committee at 2:00 PM on the 10th to discuss flour prices.

The Insurance Industry Has Acquired Foreign Exchange Profits

The Shanghai Insurance Industry Association sent representatives to Hong Kong to seek foreign exchange for insurance premiums and submitted requests to the Hong Kong office of the Exchange Equalization Fund. It is heard that a solution has been negotiated. The representatives have completed their work in Hong Kong and have already set off to return to Shanghai. As for the content of the agreed-upon solution, according to news from Hong Kong financial circles, it is roughly as follows: (1) The insurance company or its branch that obtains foreign exchange due to insurance relations must be registered with the Chinese government and located in Shanghai, and the insured person must be of Chinese, British, or American nationality. (2) The foreign exchange income and loss compensation of the insurance company, regardless of its net profit, must be provided to the Exchange Equalization Fund. (3) The foreign exchange supply is implemented at the end of each half-year, and the situation of the first half-year is checked before permission is granted. (4) When the net profit for each period accounts for more than 20% of the insurance premium income, 20% of it can be supplied with foreign exchange. If the net profit is less than 20%, all of the net profit can be supplied with foreign exchange. (5) When paying foreign insurance premiums, they should be calculated in legal currency at the official price. (6) Foreign exchange can be provided when paying overseas insurance premiums.

Price Meetings Held Daily

The Public Works Department of the Public Concession continued to hold meetings yesterday to manage the price issue. It is reported that the Public Works Department has meetings almost every day this week in the conference room of the General Office to prepare for the implementation of price management and seek practical and effective methods. Some hoarding and profiteering merchants have expressed shock at the joint efforts of the Public Works Department and import merchants to suppress prices. Furthermore, James, the owner of the famous American Jimmy's restaurant and nightclub in the city, stated this morning that he is willing to contribute a powerful weapon to stop hoarding and profiteering by turning his Silver Capital Night Garden into a retail store from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day, selling items only at the lowest profit of 10% or 20%.

Mobil Kerosene Temporarily Suspends Sales

Mobil Oil Company suddenly suspended the retail sale of kerosene this morning, causing hundreds of people wanting to buy kerosene to flock to Mobil Oil Company on Sichuan Road and Guangdong Road. Among them were hundreds of poor Russians and other Westerners, and about 400 Chinese. The traffic was obstructed. The company tightly closed its iron gates, so the masses could not enter. According to an employee of the company this morning, the company decided to stop door sales to avoid disturbances and because there were many abuses in the retail method. It was heard that someone purchased a can of kerosene from the company for $52, but when they took it elsewhere to sell it, they could get $80. This is obviously a profiteering behavior, so it was decided to stop it. The public can still buy Mobil kerosene from the company's distribution points in various places. It also stated that if the Public Works Department does not take preventive measures, it is feared that the same hoarding of kerosene will occur.

People's Organizations Support Control

Lide Fraternity and other people's organizations, the Public Works Department has petitioned for authorization to manage prices and organize an importers' association, and issued a joint declaration of support and urged early implementation to relieve the people's suffering, stating roughly: Since Shanghai became an isolated island, idle capital has gathered and speculation has become rampant, resulting in rising prices, but never has it been so severe as in recent times. This not only poses a serious threat to the lives of citizens, but also poses a great danger to social stability. Now that the Public Works Department has seen the seriousness of the situation, it has resolutely taken on the arduous task of rescuing the people, and all enlightened Chinese and foreigners should sincerely support it. After the joy of our company, we briefly express our views.

(1) Proceed Quickly: The Public Works Department has often been slow to balance prices in the past, accommodating the facts, causing it to be taken advantage of by speculators. In the future, it is necessary to quickly go to work and do everything possible to benefit the people, and it is possible to make decisive decisions. (2) Eliminate Speculation: The Public Works Department should immediately close all speculative markets within the boundary, cut off the source of fuel, and eliminate the den of speculators. At the same time, for hoarding merchants, the provisions of the Anti-Hoarding Merchants Regulations can be invoked and severe punishment can be imposed, so that selfish and treacherous merchants know how to be cautious. (3) Assess Prices: Organize a strong and perfect evaluation mechanism, investigate the cost of all daily necessities, such as food, fuel, medicine, cloth, edible oil, soap, matches, etc., and assess reasonable selling prices, which must not be exceeded.

(4) Investigate Inventory: Quickly investigate the quantity of goods in each warehouse and the names of their owners in detail. If there are goods stored by people outside the industry, or if the goods stored by people in the industry exceed the normal level, they should be taken over and distributed fairly according to their purchase price, and sold in the market. We also hope that all wage earners in each industry will publicly publish the cost of all goods in their industry at any time for the evaluation agency to refer to and avoid being deceived by cunning people. (5) Encourage Whistleblowing: Citizens should assist the authorities to investigate the cost of all items in each industry and the names of those who hoard and speculate, and report in detail. Citizens should be encouraged to blow the whistle.

The Public Works Department, with its transcendent position, is still rescuing us from our suffering. We, the citizens, should work together to overcome difficulties and dangers. Do not only seek personal gain and disregard the future of the country and the nation. Do not help the trend and hope to fish in troubled waters. It is important to know that the Shanghai market has today because of the government's supply of foreign exchange. If we cannot understand the government's painstaking efforts to maintain it, the last thing we can do is to endure the pain of cutting it off. Those who hoard and speculate will inevitably reap what they sow. All goods, how can they not be seized by the violent? Then, regardless of rich or poor, we will all perish together. When the skin is gone, what will the hair adhere to? May our citizens think about it for a long time. It is heard that the City Thrift Movement Committee also advised merchants in various industries yesterday to work together to curb the unreasonable rise in prices.

### Deputy Chief of the Japanese Police Department Decided to be Succeeded by Watanabe, Will More Actively Participate in Police Affairs, Japanese Proposals Will Continue to be Discussed

The Public Works Department and the Japanese side have reached an agreement on police negotiations, that is, to appoint Watanabe as the Deputy Chief of the Public Works Department Police Department to succeed Akagi, who was assassinated on June 17. Watanabe arrived in Shanghai on August 24 to succeed Akagi's vacant position. It is heard that he will be more actively involved in the administrative affairs of the Public Concession Police Department than Akagi. At the same time, regarding the Japanese proposals to change the Public Concession Police Department, the Public Works Department and the Japanese authorities will continue to discuss them soon. However, the details of future discussions or the changes requested by the Japanese side are not known.

### Xu Songyao's Corpse Exhumed for Examination Yesterday; Chauffeur's Coffin Also Transported Simultaneously; No Accurate Information Yet on the Outcome

Xu Songyao, the eldest son of Jia Ding native Xu Xiangsun, owner of the Huamei Pharmacy at 26 Bo Shi Road, was fatally wounded by his younger brother, Xu Daquan, with an axe and died despite medical treatment at the Mae Long Hospital. His family initially concealed the matter tightly. When news later leaked, it caused a sensation throughout Shanghai. The French police began investigating, first having Xu Songyao's coffin lifted from the Chinese Funeral Parlor a week ago and transported to the Tongren Fuyuantang for placement. The day before yesterday (Thursday) morning, the French police sent Chinese and foreign detectives to the Dahua Funeral Parlor to lift and transport the coffin of Zheng Xiangda, the chauffeur, to the Tongren Fuyuantang. That same afternoon at 4:00 PM, both the Xu and Zheng coffins were sent together to the small sickroom on Terrace Road, awaiting exhumation and examination. Xu Daquan, the perpetrator who axed Xu Songyao to death, was sent to a mental asylum after the incident. It is now reported that yesterday afternoon, detectives dispatched by the French police arrested Xu Daquan at the Red Cross Hospital on Route Ghiglieri.

After Negotiations, Entry Was Finally Granted

Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the bodies of Xu Songyao and the chauffeur were exhumed for examination at the mortuary on Terrace Road. To ensure accuracy, this newspaper dispatched a reporter to investigate. When the reporter arrived at the mortuary and attempted to enter, he was stopped by the gate guard. After the reporter negotiated, a staff member of the mortuary took the reporter's business card. Moments later, he came out and told the reporter to wait a bit before being allowed to enter. The reporter had no choice but to stand and wait outside the gate. After about twenty minutes, more and more reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers arrived. After further negotiations with the mortuary authorities, they finally agreed to allow reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers to enter.

Photography Prohibited; Viewing Denied

At this time, the two coffins of Xu Songyao and the chauffeur were already placed in the small sickroom of the mortuary. Xu's coffin was placed on two long benches, while the chauffeur's coffin was placed on the ground. This newspaper's photographer attempted to enter and take photographs but was stopped by mortuary personnel, who prohibited photography. At approximately 2:30 PM, the deceased's family members and relevant parties arrived and successively entered the small sickroom, after which the exhumation and examination began. Reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers also attempted to enter to observe but were again denied entry by mortuary personnel at the entrance to the small sickroom. Later, Chinese and Western newspaper reporters attempted to send two representatives to enter and observe, but this was also disallowed, and the door to the small sickroom was closed.

Waited a Long Time; No News

The reporters had no choice but to stand in the plaza outside the small sickroom, waiting for news after the exhumation and examination. About half an hour after the exhumation began, a staff member suddenly came out of the small sickroom, shouting for workers from the Shanghai Funeral Parlor to enter and temporarily close the coffin lids. At 4:00 PM, the examination was reopened. The reporters waited until about 5:00 PM and then inquired with relevant parties about when the examination procedures would be completed. They were told that the examination procedures were quite complicated and would take a long time.

Chauffeur's Family Extremely Taciturn

Because it was getting late, and the lights in the mortuary and on the roads were all lit, the reporters returned to their offices. The details of the exhumation and examination of Xu Songyao and the chauffeur's bodies, as well as the causes of death, remained unknown. At the time, there were hundreds of citizens outside the mortuary's main gate attempting to enter to observe, but they were all prohibited from entering by the gate guards. At that time, the reporter attempted to investigate everything with Mr. Zheng, a member of the chauffeur's family, but Mr. Zheng remained extremely taciturn and did not say a word.

Guangci Hospital Doctor Participated

According to another report, Xu Songyao was injured on the 21st and died at 4:00 PM on the 26th, while the chauffeur Zheng Daxiang died on the 24th. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the exhumation and examination took place. In addition to the French police requesting Dr. Shang Deli (transliteration), a prominent doctor from Guangci Hospital, to participate in the examination, Xu's elder sisters, Jihua and Xihua, also arrived on the scene. Jihua wore a light green coat and a dark green cheongsam, while Xihua wore a light yellow coat and a black cheongsam, accompanied by Tu Kaiwei, the manager of Jicheng Pharmacy. In addition, two staff members from Huamei Pharmacy were present. Only Jihua and Xihua were allowed to enter during the examination.

Xu Songyao Had Several Injuries

According to the latest news from relevant parties last night, the results of the examination of Xu Songyao and the chauffeur's bodies showed that Xu Songyao had several injuries. The chauffeur's body was dissected by the forensic doctor, and his stomach and intestines were removed for forensic examination.

### Approaching the National Father's Birthday; City Prepares to Celebrate; Promote Local Work to Show Reverence; The Day After Is the Fourth Anniversary of Shanghai's Fall

November 12th is the National Father's birthday anniversary. All sectors of the city are preparing to celebrate it enthusiastically. November 13th is the fourth anniversary of the fall of Greater Shanghai. It will be commemorated with solemn and respectful emotions, as a painful memorial. The concession authorities are implementing security measures starting yesterday to ensure public safety. The details are reported by a Daguang News Agency reporter as follows:

National Father's Birthday

November 12th is the National Father's birthday anniversary. Due to the special environment of Shanghai, the city's residents have decided to follow the memorial methods for extraordinary times, stopping extravagant celebrations. According to the flag-hanging methods agreed upon by various groups and the two concession authorities, national flags will be hung uniformly on this day for one day. All institutions, organizations, factories, and schools will also follow the usual practice of taking a holiday to celebrate. Citizens from all walks of life, to revere the National Father's revolutionary spirit, have decided to intensify the promotion of the fundraising campaign for winter clothing and to step up efforts in frugality and disaster relief to demonstrate the Shanghai citizens' utmost concern for the country and their compatriots.

Anniversary of the Fall

November 13th is the fourth anniversary of the National Army's withdrawal and the fall of Greater Shanghai. Because of the special situation, all sectors are unable to hold commemorative ceremonies, so they have unanimously decided to conduct a solemn spiritual commemoration. All compatriots in the city recall the loyalty and courage of the soldiers who fought bloody battles in Songhu four years ago today, as well as the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life who destroyed their homes to relieve national difficulties. This further increases their determination to strive for strength, with the spirit of enduring hardship and learning lessons from experience, working hard and inspiring themselves, striving to be promising, vowing to follow in the footsteps of the martyrs, working hard, supporting national policies, and remaining unwavering.

### Highest Coal Price Actually Exceeds the Thousand Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the coal market became even more rampant. Indian smoked coal was fiercely raised to 1,040 yuan per ton, which is shocking. There is a market for coal briquettes, but there is no supply. The prices of other kinds of smoked white coal have been continuously raised. These unusual transactions are all operated by a group of coal profiteers. The Coal Industry Association has failed to stop and thoroughly investigate these illegal transactions, which is disappointing.

### U.S. Naval Fourth Fleet Establishes Anniversary Today

The U.S. Naval Fourth Fleet will hold a grand dance party at the Naval Youth Association today to celebrate the 166th anniversary of the establishment of the U.S. Naval Fourth Fleet. At that time, the Fourth Fleet's band will play music, and a huge "birthday cake" will be presented in the evening, led by Mrs. Oliver, chairman of the American Women's Association, and McDonald, an officer of the Fourth Fleet. The dance party will be held in the gymnasium there, decorated with lights and colors. Because there are concerns about the large number of guests, participants must reserve seats in advance.

### Entrance to Manila Bay Is Now Being Equipped with Mines; Military Exercises Conducted Simultaneously in Coastal Areas; Area Within Fifteen Kilometers Is a Danger Zone

It is said that the US President Lines' mail ships traveling the Far East route have recently suspended their voyages to Manila. According to sources in the shipping industry, this rumor is due to a recent notice issued by the Philippine authorities stating that the entrance to Manila Bay will be equipped with mines from the 1st to the 30th of this month. At the same time, military exercises must be conducted in various coastal areas of the Philippines, stipulating that the area within fifteen kilometers of the coast is a danger zone. Ships traveling in this area should pay special attention during this period. The US ships have temporarily suspended their voyages as a precautionary measure. It is also reported that the Hong Kong authorities have also notified the shipping companies of various countries sailing between Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila to be aware of this.

### Request to Suppress Charitable Lottery; Authorities Have Not Studied It; Christian Groups Believe It Is Gambling; But Many Poor People Rely on It for Relief

Representatives of twenty Christian groups recently jointly sent letters to the Public Concession's Municipal Council and the French Concession's Conseil d'Administration, requesting the suppression of the charitable lottery. The letter stated briefly that lotteries are a type of gambling, and the nature of all gambling is no different from theft, because it seeks to obtain other people's money without working for it. Lotteries not only cultivate gambling habits among the people but also generate a spirit of theft. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to suppress charitable lotteries in the two concessions, and if necessary, to appeal to the law.

The reasons for submitting these applications can be divided into three points: (1) Lotteries are gambling, which is extremely harmful to morals and the people, especially the Chinese. In principle, issuing lotteries is no different from setting up gambling dens. However, the poison of lotteries is more widespread, because its vicious influence also extends to the homes of countless people who never enter gambling dens. Issuing lotteries is to scrape up the money of many people and give only a portion of it to a few. (2) The laws of China, Britain, and the United States all stipulate that lotteries are illegal. Shanghai should follow this highest moral standard. (3) Christianity does not want to use funds obtained by destroying the morals of the people to support Christian charities. The religious groups that jointly applied include the China Inland Mission, the American Methodist Church, the Bible Society, the Baptist Church, Muir Church, the Salvation Army, and the American Presbyterian Church, etc. Also, the English-language "China Press" said that the authorities in this city will ignore the church groups, the so-called "Christian Crusade," that are seeking to abolish the refugee lottery.

According to Mr. Magre, the French Consul-General in Shanghai, who told reporters this morning (the 7th), the charitable lottery was legally established, and the church groups' opposition has no reason. Mr. Magre also said that the French Consulate-General in Shanghai granted the lottery the right to issue, and sent a manager to supervise the lottery drawing and other matters. The charitable lottery staff also expressed disagreement with the church groups' application, saying that since the charitable lottery was established in August of the 27th year, until the end of August of this year, it has distributed more than 1.7 million yuan to various charitable organizations. The Salvation Army, which participated in this application, also received 4,000 yuan in charitable lottery surplus from the French Consul-General in November. Municipal Council officials refused to make any comments on this, only saying that the bureau is currently focusing on the city's serious food situation. According to the application letter from the church groups, the signing representative is headed by Mr. Rankin. Mr. Rankin recently sued the "North China Daily News" for publishing lottery advertisements.

### Concealing Foreign Rice; Store Owner Detained; Sentencing Set for the 10th

Since the Municipal Council sold out of foreign rice, countless poor people are suffering from a lack of daily meals. Recently, they have been trying to rescue the hungry people and distribute hundreds of dan of stored foreign rice to designated rice stores in various districts for sale to temporarily maintain the situation. However, the Dafeng Rice Store at 409 Route Au Tou, obtained 20 bags of foreign rice from the Municipal Council the day before yesterday. On the morning of the 6th, they put up a sign for sale. Hundreds of poor people nearby rushed to buy it, causing a great deal of crowding. After a while, the rice store said it was sold out, and removed the foreign rice sign issued by the Municipal Council, but there were still dozens of poor people who had not bought any. They had to disperse separately. At that time, Hua Butou Zhang Wenjun happened to be patrolling and entered the store to investigate. He found five bags of rice. The bag skins were the store's own, which aroused suspicion. He opened them and saw that they were all foreign rice sold by the Municipal Council. He questioned the store owner, Xie Zhengming, a native of Nanjing, but he was vague and claimed that they were kept for the store's staff to eat. The Butou knew that he was cunning and trying to profit. He immediately seized the five bags of rice and took the store owner Xie to the Putuo Road police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a public prosecution on the charge of deception under Article 32, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce. The judge ordered that he be detained and set the sentencing for the 10th of this month. Bail was not allowed.

### Impersonating a Postman to Solicit Wine Money; Stealing by Opportunity

Yesterday afternoon, a Chinese man wearing a postman's uniform went to a Westerner's home to solicit wine money. After the Westerner gave him the money, he left. Later, he discovered that a watch and 30 yuan in legal tender had been stolen. Recently, similar thefts have occurred in the French Concession. In the future, residents in the concession should pay special attention to strangers who enter their homes under various pretexts to avoid unnecessary losses.

### Cook Commits Murder; Chops Four Members of the Employer's Family; Chen Shen's Injuries Were Too Severe and She Died

Chen Yinlai, a Tianjin native, 51 years old, his wife Chen Shen, 48 years old, his eldest daughter Ciheng, 21 years old, and his youngest daughter Yingfen, 13 years old, lived together at 43 Cihui Lane, Route Foch. Chen recently made a lot of money doing speculative business, so the family was well-off. He hired a Tianjin native, Wei Zhang (42 years old), as a cook. Yesterday at about 6:00 PM, the cook, because his request for a pay raise was not granted, suddenly used a sharp blade to chop all four members of Chen Yinlai's family. Chen was chopped in the back of the head, and his wife, Shen, was chopped in the right ear, with a wound about three inches deep. The two daughters were injured in the head and hands. They were taken by car to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Chen Shen's injuries were too severe, and she died before she could be treated. Chen's injuries were also quite serious, and his life was in danger. The two daughters suffered lighter injuries. The murderer was arrested on the spot and taken to the police station for processing.

### Hardoon's Estate; British Office Sends Staff to Manage; Affairs of Hardoon & Co. Are All Suspended

The English-language "China Press" said that after Mrs. Luo Jialing Hardoon passed away on October 3rd, the various parties were competing fiercely for her vast estate, and two wills were in contention. The British Office in China has not yet formally heard the case. However, Hardoon's estate is lacking managers, resulting in the unpaid rent of more than 1,600 tenants, more than a hundred employees of Hardoon & Co. requesting pay raises, and the matter has not been resolved. Payments have been suspended. Therefore, after the lawyers representing various parties negotiated, they requested the British Office to send someone to temporarily manage the estate. Sir Mosso, the British Registrar, then appointed McMath and Hartman, the chief accountants of the Kerzner & Co., this morning (the 7th) as the Hardoon Estate administrators during the litigation period.

### Brazilian Consul in Shanghai; Car Robbed

M. Miguez, the Brazilian Consul in Shanghai, accompanied by his wife, took a Ford car, license number 吏字九號, driven by a chauffeur, to the Grand Cathay Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road to see a movie at 9:00 PM the night before last. After Mr. and Mrs. Miguez got out of the car, they walked into the theater. The driver parked the car near Park Road. At about 9:45 PM, while the driver was dozing in the car, three robbers suddenly got into the back of the car. One of the robbers drew a pistol and struck the driver's head, forcing him to drive west. The driver, under the threat of a gun, had no choice but to obey and drive. When the car reached the vicinity of Xiaoshadu Road, the robbers drove the driver out of the car, and one of the robbers sped away. Afterwards, the chauffeur ran to report to the owner and reported the matter to the competent police station, requesting investigation. It was heard yesterday that the robbed car had not yet been found. Recently, cases of stolen cars in this city have been increasing. There are about ninety cars reported to the police station for investigation. However, the car of a diplomatic officer being robbed is still unprecedented.

### Ticket Seller's Attempted Extortion Fails; Assaults Passenger; Plaintiff Does Not Want to Pursue

At Guangdong Road near Fujian Road, they actually beat up Zang, causing multiple injuries. The Laozha police station was reported, and the two persons Ni and Qin were accused of injury by the First Special Court, and they have been summoned once. Because the plaintiff was not present, the order was changed to another date. Yesterday morning, the trial was continued in the Fifth Criminal Division by Judge Zhan Liangce. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, said that the plaintiff had been summoned to the case by the police station today. Zang Fugen said that the defendant, Ni Yubiao, had now asked someone to reconcile with him, and he did not want to pursue the matter because the defendant's mother was old and his wife's father was sick in bed, making the situation pitiful. Judge Zhan then announced that the case would not be accepted.

### South Goods Store Fraudulently Obtaining Material; Manager and Staff Fined

The prices in this city have risen to the extreme, and the general merchants are still sparing no effort to exploit heavily, reducing the amount of weight. The situation is extremely hateful.

Piero discovered the matter and reported it to the police station, which transferred the summons to the First Special Court. Yesterday morning, the manager of the store, Shao Shuhan, and the staff member, Zhang Zhitang, were summoned to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the details of the case and prosecuted them for the crime of fraud. After a clear interrogation by Judge Zhan Liangce, it was decided that Shao and Zhang were jointly guilty of obtaining illegal benefits in property by fraudulent means, and each was fined 200 yuan as a warning.

### Chen Yinglin's Invention: Scientific Abacus; Ministry of Education Orders All Schools to List as a Required Subject

(Kunming Airmail) Chen Yinglin, a wealthy overseas Chinese merchant residing in Burma, noted that since the invention of the abacus in China during the Han Dynasty, it had undergone modifications during the Tang and Song Dynasties, flourished during the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, but had declined since the Republic of China era. This was because scholars did not delve deeply into its study, and the government provided little promotion. As a result, this calculating tool, invented thousands of years ago, had not been improved or advanced. It could only calculate integer addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and could not perform more complex calculations or handle more intricate matters, making it difficult to adapt to modern needs. Chen Yinglin, therefore, dedicated himself to research, applying scientific perspectives and methods to strive for improvement, enabling it to calculate compound numbers, fractions, squares, cubes, and more to meet current demands. He spent three years and over ten thousand Burmese currency units, meticulously studying and reforming the mechanism, finally achieving success. It was named the "Chen's Abacus," and it was registered in Burma, India, and other places. It was also recognized by friendly people from India and Burma as being better than mechanical calculators, praised as a new invention in academic circles, and widely adopted. This summer, Mr. Chen returned to China and submitted his remodeled models and the Chen's Abacus instruction manual to the Ministry of Education for review and filing. He also received a certificate of merit and a bonus of fifty thousand yuan from the Ministry of Education.

(Construction) The construction of this new type of scientific abacus consists of a total of twenty-five columns, which is equivalent to combining two ordinary abacuses. The middle column serves as the basic unit, and it is then divided into left and right sections, allowing for the simultaneous calculation of multiple different units of currency and numbers. Moreover, the calculation is swift and without any delays. Within the horizontal bar of the abacus, there is a table listing integers, compound numbers, decimals, fractions, complex fractions, area, volume, and angles, etc. At the right end of the beam, there is a black bead. When it is necessary to record a column number, simply turn the black bead, and the required recording table will appear within the beam. Calculations can then be performed based on the table. This not only eliminates the risk of incorrect column usage but also assists the user in their calculations. It effectively combines written calculation and mental calculation into one. Regardless of the currency system or complex numbers of any country, they can all be accurately calculated.

(Algorithm) As for the calculation method, it is also simple. The instruction manual divides it into integer algorithm, decimal algorithm, fraction algorithm, omission method, compound number algorithm, compound quantity algorithm, unitary method, proportional calculation method, and various other algorithms. Although the names are numerous and varied, anyone familiar with ordinary abacus calculation can understand them at a glance. The invention and improvement of this calculating tool is truly a major achievement in history and science. The long-standing problems of our industrial and commercial sectors have been solved. According to Mr. Chen, mass production is currently underway, and the government is also making every effort to assist and will include it as a required subject in schools for widespread promotion, with the aim of making it universally accessible.

Random Thoughts

### "Doing All Kinds of Evil" "Always Responsive"

— Yu Gong

—An Interesting and Detestable Incident—

Yesterday's newspaper reported that "Seven extortionists, including Ding Yirui, went to the Hong Temple on Nanjing Road to burn incense and pray, then sent letters to the manager of the Yisheng Rubber Factory, demanding money under threat. They were actually extorted for 1,500 yuan. After investigation by detectives, the seven people, including Ding, were arrested. It was said that after obtaining the money, Ding and others made a plaque with the inscription 'Always Responsive' and sent it to the Hong Temple. After investigation, it was confirmed. The court will pronounce the verdict soon."

Everyone finds this incident of the extortionists' whimsical thinking quite "interesting and detestable." Of course, the fact that the extortionists committed a crime is a fact, and the law will judge them accordingly. What we want to talk about is an incidental feeling:

Extortion incidents are common in Shanghai. What is new is "praying for extortion." The extortionists disregard the law, yet have Buddha in their hearts. The plaque they respectfully sent, in my opinion, may be a couplet with the first line missing. Their couplet should be: "Although I do all kinds of evil, you should always be responsive." In fact, in today's Shanghai society, there is a lot of bullish and bearish air every day. Rice merchants say that storage in the warehouses is not abundant, and coal merchants say that the source is not smooth. All in all, they are just threatening the citizens, hoping to make a fortune. After getting the money, the extortionists felt that although they dared to deceive people, they did not dare to deceive the heavens, so they did this kind of "hiding silver three hundred taels here, the neighbor's son has never stolen it" dedication. As for these speculative merchants, they hate having too much hoarding and do not plot without profit. Compared to the extortionists, they do evil hundreds or thousands of times more. However, except for being "always responsive" to their beloved wives and beautiful children when it comes to spending lavishly, they are indifferent to everything else. Of course, if they can get a plaque that says "Money Can Prevent Death" in the Yama's Palace, they will do their best.

Buddha said that all four elements are empty. Now, the extortionists' extortion was surprisingly successful. However, they ended up in jail, and the result is still empty. They prayed for wealth and got a response, but they could not escape punishment. Whether "always responsive" is beneficial or harmful to them, they only know today that it is too late to regret. Then there are those speculators who have already been scorned by society and some who are throwing themselves into the legal net. Today's doing all kinds of evil and being always responsive is also tomorrow's suffering from wealth and the defeat of children. Water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it. Money can save people, but it can also kill people. I hope that all visible and invisible extortionists will immediately wake up and not take the path of suicide!

The plaque offered by the extortionists actually claimed to be disciples, which is really a disgrace to Buddhism. The fact that these law-breaking "disciples" are ultimately brought to justice is precisely the "manifestation of the Buddha's mighty spirit"! I am not a Buddhist, but I do have a precept of "sincerity brings efficacy." I think that all those who seek fame, profit, and all kinds of satisfaction of desires are in vain. Only sincerity, frankness, purity, enthusiasm, and loyalty in dealing with people, sincere self-discipline, and seeking peace of mind can truly be always responsive and always efficacious. These extortionists offering a plaque to the Hong Temple is of course laughable, but ultimately pathetic.

War

### Moscow's Air Defense

— He Kai

Since suffering its first air raid on July 21st, Moscow is now being bombed by German aircraft almost every day. Based on the extensive experience gained, Moscow's air defense lines are also gradually being improved and enriched.

Currently, Moscow's air defense is formed by five elements: (1) anti-aircraft guns, (2) aircraft, (3) barrage balloon teams, (4) fire brigades, and (5) self-defense forces. In terms of nature, the first three belong to the offensive, while the latter two belong to passive defense.

The self-defense forces are organized by citizens. Their tasks are: conveying orders, assisting fire brigades, and rescuing the injured, etc. All men between the ages of sixteen and sixty are obligated to participate in the team, and in emergencies, women between the ages of eighteen and fifty are also mobilized.

Aircraft and anti-aircraft guns are deployed at key points on the outskirts of Moscow, trying to block the intrusion of German aircraft into Moscow city. Closely cooperating with them are the aircraft observers scattered every ten kilometers outside Moscow. However, according to past experience, some enemy aircraft inevitably break through the air defense network and appear in the city's airspace, dropping explosive and incendiary bombs. At this time, the most important thing is to reduce the damage to a minimum. Therefore, air-raid shelters and defense against incendiary bombs are indispensable equipment. In this regard, the world's largest and best-equipped subway, built in Moscow before the war by the Soviet authorities, can be said to be extremely prescient. The subway is currently being used as the largest air-raid shelter, but it obviously cannot accommodate all the people of Moscow. Therefore, the basements of major buildings are being quickly converted into air-raid shelters. These basements were used as cafeterias and warehouses before the war and have equipment such as chairs, so using them as air-raid shelters is very ideal.

The subway turns into an air-raid shelter every night from eight to nine o'clock. When there is no air-raid alarm, women and children are allowed to enter from nine o'clock in the afternoon. After the last tram passes, wooden boards are laid on the tracks, and beds are built on top of them. When an air-raid alert is received, ordinary men and women can run in and squeeze onto the platforms or the tracks covered with boards. To meet the needs of the general public, food and drinks are sold here, and some stations even have newsreels playing, so hiding inside does not feel boring.

Each floor of Moscow's apartments has sand and water prepared. Bathtubs must be filled with water all day long, and shovels, hoes, sickles, fire extinguishers, lanterns, and anti-incendiary masks must all be prepared in advance. At the beginning of the war, the authorities ordered all households to close their windows during air raids, but according to practical experience, when encountering bombs with great explosive force, closed windows are more likely to have their glass shattered than open windows. Therefore, the authorities revised their previous order. Upon receiving an alert, all windows except those in the basement must be opened. The windows of the basement are covered with sandbags and wooden boards to prevent the glass from shattering.

Moscow is making the greatest effort in the defense against incendiary bombs. The most hardworking in this regard are the self-defense forces mentioned above. After the air-raid alert is issued, the more active young people in the self-defense forces climb to the rooftops to monitor the dropping of incendiary bombs. However, after two or three air raids, it was proved that monitoring on the roof is very dangerous because anti-aircraft gun shrapnel falls on the body like rain. Therefore, according to the new rules, monitors should monitor from the top floor. When he sees an incendiary bomb falling on the roof, he immediately jumps out of the window on the top floor and pushes it onto the street or garden with a wooden stick. Below, another group of self-defense forces is waiting. When they see an incendiary bomb falling, they quickly use sand and water to extinguish it. The agility of the self-defense forces in doing this heroic work is admirable.

### "The Pig's Answer"

— Zhu Xun

In "The Purpose of Life" written by Bolespon, we saw "The Pig's Answer." He wrote the purpose of the pig's life in a satirical tone.

He said, "The life of a pig is nothing more than drinking swill and being lazy all day long to maintain their obesity and create delicious ham! But even if they don't do this, the supply of ham is still their destiny."

But the destiny of human beings is not to supply ham. Why are so many people as stupid as pigs? Why are they heading towards the same destiny as pigs?

No matter how many millions of gold dollars you have, no matter how much false fame and power you have, but if you die, you will be as unknown as a pig. What do you share with mankind! That is so pitiful!

Are we just living in this society and only getting food and sleep?

Military Preparations

### The "Electric Rabbit" in the Target Range

— Ke Zhong

A novel method used by the British Royal Air Force to train machine gunners is to put a model aircraft, nicknamed "Electric Rabbit," on a car, and then have the car carrying the aircraft run quickly around the range on a circular narrow track as a target, and then have the gunners aim at the moving target and practice shooting. To make it more realistic, they painted the model aircraft with the German swastika emblem, which is also easier to arouse interest. The principle of this "Electric Rabbit" is the same as the electric rabbit in a dog racing track.

The Life of Fourteen Heroes "Madam, I've heard you mention the Guiding Society several times, mostly because my dad is too stubborn and didn't let you recommend me to go there. But when I think about it carefully, since you say it's just accompanying people from other places to buy things and strolling around the park, it doesn't really matter. It's a pity that I'm also a country bumpkin who just arrived in Shanghai, otherwise I really want to ask you to recommend me to try it out."

The woman, who was every bit a Shanghai playboy's sister-in-law, was so happy that she almost laughed her nose off. She said that as long as you know a lot of words, the roads in Shanghai are the easiest to find. She didn't have time to say anything else to Mei Bao, so she quickly urged her to wash up and go to a so-called Harmonious Guiding Society.

Luckily, Mei Bao was very resourceful. As soon as she saw the small pavilion filled with many heavily made-up women and a few gigolos, she suddenly understood. Before the proprietress could achieve her purpose of selling her, she hurriedly ran back.

Because of this incident, she became more aware of the difficulty of making a living and also knew that women's opportunities were indeed more difficult than men's. Therefore, when Qiu Haitang came home and said something, although she felt very suspicious in her heart, she did not have the courage to ask further.

Seeing that his daughter already believed him, Qiu Haitang became even more relieved and tried his best to put on a happy face. (257)

### Stomach Disease Classic

Knowing the Judgment of Good and Bad Stomach Medicine: Any stomach medicine that, after taking for half a month, does not improve but requires an increasing dosage, can be determined to be absolutely impossible to cure stomach disease and may even worsen it. Conversely, any stomach medicine that, after taking for half a month, shows complete recovery or relief and can reduce the dosage, can be trusted to cure stomach disease. There are many stomach medicines on the market, but the only one whose dosage can be gradually reduced until the disease is completely eradicated and health is restored is "Qubing."

Treating Stomach Disease Requires Treating Stomach Ulcers

The root of old stomach diseases lies in stomach ulcers. Stomach medicines containing anesthetics and alkaline substances such as sodium bicarbonate or calcium, magnesium, and bismuth cannot cure stomach ulcers, so they can never cure old stomach diseases. "Qubing" is a newly created aluminum compound that can quickly heal stomach ulcers, so it can cure old stomach diseases. Stopping stomach pain is just one of its effects.

"Qubing" Overpowers Famous Imported Medicines

It has been repeatedly heard that people with old stomach diseases have been taking foreign stomach medicines for many years, but their condition has not improved, or even worsened. However, after taking "Qubing" for a month, the disease was completely eradicated and health was restored. Furthermore, according to reports from many doctors, the curative effect of "Qubing" in eradicating stomach diseases has indeed surpassed all famous and expensive stomach medicines from the East and West. Other low-grade medicines are not worth mentioning. This is truly good news for stomach disease patients and a glory for the domestic industry. Produced by Tianping Pharmaceutical Factory. Various packages and pocket boxes are sold in major pharmacies and companies. Trial packs are sold in tobacco paper stores.

### Man-Er Oberon Talks About Why Wives Leave Their Husbands

— Li Yi

Hollywood star Man-Er Oberon, a lively star, recently refuted a university professor's statement with her eloquent tongue, adding glory to the female world. The matter is like this: John Hanfan, a professor of law at Philadelphia, listed six reasons why a husband does not like to be with his wife, one of which said: "They are unkempt and disheveled at breakfast."

"Professor John's words have their merits," Miss Man unconvincingly criticized, "but he has overlooked that this issue has two sides, so it must be observed from the wife's perspective!"

Miss Man then listed six reasons why wives are often unwilling to be with their husbands and would rather go out for a walk alone, because husbands commit the following mistakes:

(1) Hiding in their own offices all day long.

(2) Thinking that reading books and newspapers is more interesting than family conversations.

(3) Talking about shops and closing their mouths about factories, as if they are living for their careers.

(4) When she goes to talk to him, he yells at you like a pig.

(5) Paying attention to art, culture, etc., and not caring about other things.

(6) Considering "love" as old news.

Miss Man concluded: "If husbands can correct these shortcomings, then many wives may no longer be unkempt and disheveled at breakfast!"

Listen! How true and humorous are Miss Man's words!

### Zhang Wenjuan Records "The Strange Injustice Case"

— Lili

All Twelve Sides - Shipping in Three Weeks

Kun actor (female playing male roles) Zhang Wenjuan performed "Golden Stage" last month, receiving good reviews and ticket sales. After her performance at "Golden Stage" ended, she originally planned to return north. However, the Asia-Pacific Victory Company asked the painter Ding Song to negotiate with her about recording records, so she temporarily delayed her departure. The recording negotiations went smoothly, and she is recording the "Complete Strange Injustice Case," a total of twelve sides, from "Setting Out" to "Begging for the Basin," with Liu Binkun, the number one comedian from the South, and others playing the roles of Zhang Biegui, etc. The musician is the famous left-handed king, Zhao Lama. "The Strange Injustice Case" is a famous Tan school opera and one of Wenjuan's masterpieces. After going north, many small arias were corrected by Meng Xiaodong, which made it even more perfect. The entire lyrics and phonetics were studied more than seven times beforehand before being completely recorded at Victory yesterday afternoon.

According to Victory's Mr. Pu Meizhong, songs and records can be sold in Southeast Asia and are relatively popular in the country. Therefore, record companies are now collecting more of these records. As for Peking opera, sales are limited to a portion of Peking opera enthusiasts, so they are collecting fewer. This time, we invited Ms. Zhang to record the "Complete Strange Injustice Case" after careful consideration and with considerable confidence. Therefore, the records can be shipped by the end of this month at the latest.

Recently, the Shanghai music scene has been quite vibrant. Concerts of harmonicas and accordions, etc., are being held continuously. Not long ago, Lang Yuxiu's two solo concerts at the Lyceum Theatre were sold out, showing the enthusiasm of the general public. Music is truly spiritual food.

Meye (violin solo), (3) Porge (cello solo), (4) Trio, (5) Trio Munuet form, (6) Soprano solo "Flower Selling Song" by Zhang Hao, (7) Chorus. Among them, several points should be introduced to the readers: Tenor Wu Zheng, Ms. Lang Yuxiu, and Mr. Si Yigui are all students of the Russian vocal expert Shu Shuline, and are among his most outstanding students. Several months ago, he held a personal solo concert at the Russian Art Theatre, and the grand occasion can be proven by the facts. Now he will hold a personal concert at the Lyceum Theatre. Mr. Meye is a famous violinist from Moscow, and his superb technique makes him a first-class contemporary violinist. In addition, composer Zheng Shouyan put in a lot of effort for the success of this concert. I would like to emphasize this specifically, hoping that music lovers will pay attention.

Chapter 19: Dusk - The Nomad Cavalry Filled the City with Dust

Zhang Cangqiu and three other heroes were about to leave Shanhaiguan and go to another place, striving to eliminate traitors for the country. Unexpectedly, someone came chasing after them on the road. Zhang Cangqiu looked back and saw three horses galloping toward them on the main road behind them. The first horse was ridden by a general, with a fair complexion and a short beard under his chin, who was none other than Chai Ying. He couldn't help but be stunned, and immediately turned his horse around and waited. Chai Ying's horse ran to him and pulled the reins to stop. He bowed on horseback and said, "Brother Zhang, where are you going?" Zhang Cangqiu heard him ask so closely and didn't know what to say for a moment. Seeing that the two horses behind Chai Ying were ridden by Chai Ying's trusted followers, he forced a smile and said, "Brother Chai, aren't you staying in Ningyuan?" "How did you get back here?" Chai Ying heard Zhang Cangqiu not answer his question but instead ask him, smiled, and jumped off his horse. Zhang Cangqiu saw Chai Ying dismount and also jumped off his horse. Chen Fei, Xu Jing, Liu Yinying, and others also dismounted together. Chai Ying wiped the sweat from his forehead, took Zhang Cangqiu's hand, and said, "Let's go to the woods ahead to talk." Zhang Cangqiu said, "Alright." The four followed Chai Ying to a pine forest to the east, where the lush grass was like green brocade and the wild flowers seemed to burn. Everyone sat on the ground. Their horses were being watched over by Chai Ying's two followers over there. Chai Ying said first, "I heard in Ningyuan that the rebel Li was about to move to the capital, which also shocked me. Then I received General Wu's order to launch an expedition against the rebels, which gave me some comfort. But then I heard that General Wu had retreated to Shanhaiguan, and Li's rebels were launching a large-scale attack, and there was news of a raid on Ningyuan. (123)
