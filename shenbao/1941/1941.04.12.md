### 美丹雙方簽定協定　置格林蘭於美保護下　美將在該島設立空軍根據地　以防禦西半球以外國家侵入

Batavia: Tension in the Dutch East Indies has increased today. All parties are closely watching Foreign Minister Matsuoka's imminent return to Tokyo. Negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands are still at a standstill. It is reported that many Japanese expatriates continue to evacuate from the Netherlands. The Japanese consulate here is very crowded, with Japanese expatriates requesting evacuation, settling affairs, and preparing to leave. However, there is an apparent contradiction: the number of Japanese buying cars and houses in Batavia has increased, even though the purchase price is paid in foreign exchange, and it is difficult for Japanese to obtain foreign exchange.

Washington: President Roosevelt placed Greenland under the protection of the United States yesterday. The White House said that President Roosevelt took this action after learning that German planes had flown over Greenland. Roosevelt signed an agreement with the Danish Minister on Wednesday, stipulating that no country other than Denmark would be allowed to seize control of Greenland. The agreement also included the United States' right to establish air force bases and other armed fortresses on the island. A White House spokesman said that Greenland and any other foreign territory in the Western Hemisphere, including Canada, would be protected by the United States if attacked. The spokesman said that the United States suggests that Greenland be ruled by Denmark, but when Denmark is under Nazi rule, the United States must protect Greenland. The provisions of the agreement stipulate that the United States may deepen military ports, construct railways and transportation facilities, and use land and blood areas to facilitate defense, and maintain radio and meteorological communications. The agreement grants the United States freedom from tariffs to transport supplies and raw materials. It is stated that the agreement will remain in effect until the period that currently endangers the peace and security of the American continent has passed. The State Department issued a lengthy statement declaring that the historically significant agreement for Greenland was a reaffirmation of Roosevelt's "non-recognition of illegality and violence," such as Germany's aggression against Denmark. The statement said, "In the summer of 1940, the activities of Germans on the east coast of Greenland became increasingly obvious. Germany transported two ships to the vicinity of the island, ostensibly for trade and science, but in reality to provide meteorological assistance to the war in the North Atlantic. In the fall of that year, German reconnaissance planes flew over the eastern part of Greenland. On March 27, 1941, a German bomber flew over the eastern part of the island, and the next day, German military aircraft conducted reconnaissance flights there." It is also learned that the signatories to this agreement were Danish Minister Kauffmann and President Roosevelt. (United Press dispatch on the 11th)

Washington: According to sources here, the United States is currently establishing an air force base in Greenland to protect Greenland and the Western Hemisphere in accordance with the US-Danish agreement signed on Wednesday. The United States has thus taken action in the international arena. Although Danish territory is now under German occupation, Danish Minister to the United States Kauffmann has signed an agreement with the United States, placing Greenland under the protection of the United States. The agreement stipulates that the United States may establish air force bases on the island to protect Greenland and the Western Hemisphere. The news of the signing was announced yesterday, the signing date being Wednesday night. The signatories were US Secretary of State Hull and Danish Minister Kauffmann. President Roosevelt commented that this move was new evidence of the United States' maintenance of friendship with Denmark, with the aim of keeping Greenland a Danish colony. Presidential Secretary O'Leary said that the United States concluded this agreement after receiving intelligence that German planes had flown over Greenland. The island is now in the same position as all other islands in the Atlantic that are not part of the United States. This move by the United States is fully in line with the conditions of the Monroe Doctrine and the declaration signed at the Havana Conference last year. If the island is attacked, the United States will defend it. The United States has previously adopted the same attitude towards the defense of Canada. This agreement was signed on the anniversary of the German invasion of Denmark. We sincerely hope to save Denmark and separate it from the current aggressors. Responsible parties in London believe that the US-Danish negotiations are a welcome expression of the United States' sympathy for the Danish people. (Reuters dispatch on the 11th)

### 總統要求兩院授權　徵用外國留美商船

Washington: President Roosevelt today requested the Senate and House of Representatives to authorize the government to seize all foreign merchant ships that have been anchored in US ports for a long time. Regarding this matter, President Roosevelt also made a statement to the press, stating that thirty-nine Danish merchant ships are now under the management of the US Coast Guard. I intend to submit a bill to the Senate and House of Representatives so that the Bureau can legally purchase them. The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 stipulates that in the event of an emergency or when necessary for national defense, the President has the right to purchase any private ship owned by the United States, but the companies should be given considerable compensation. At a time when the tonnage of the US merchant fleet is quite scarce, it is naturally necessary to formulate similar laws for all foreign merchant ships anchored in US ports. Currently, in addition to the aforementioned thirty-eight Danish transport ships, there are also two German cargo ships and twenty-eight Italian ships anchored in the United States, which have been taken over by the US authorities due to crew members engaging in sabotage. (Havas dispatch on the 11th)

Washington: President Roosevelt sent a special message to Congress yesterday, requesting authorization for him to seize any foreign ships on US waters and to pay a fair commission.

The countries concerned with the requisitioned ships will be compensated by the US government from the $7,000,000,000 lease-lend fund. President Roosevelt's message stated, "In order to cope with the sabotage of shipbuilding, I want us to have a certain power to requisition foreign ships with fair compensation."

Editorial

### A Static Review of the Balkans

The Balkan countries have once again become the focus of the world's attention. In terms of the current war situation, there have been minor victories, but the main frontal battle has not yet begun, let alone the outcome. In terms of the Balkans themselves, the geography, history, and national conditions of the various countries have a fundamental relationship to the future direction of the situation. Therefore, let's try to make a static review.

The world has always referred to the Balkans as either the "European Cockpit" or the "European Powder Keg." Not to mention too far back. In 1912, there was the First Balkan War; in 1913, there was the Second Balkan War; in 1914, it directly served as the fuse for the last World War, and this lasted for five years. Only after the 1919 Treaty of Versailles did today's so-called Balkans appear. This includes Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Greece, Albania, and the European part of Turkey. This time, in terms of area, due to the collapse of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, part of its territory was merged into the Balkan countries, so it has expanded much more than the original territory.

Geographically, the Balkans are a peninsula. To the south is the Mediterranean Sea and the Aegean Sea, to the east is the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara, and to the west is the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian Sea. Only the north borders the Soviet Union, Poland, the Czech Republic, and other countries. Romania has a total area of 110,300 square miles and a population of 19.5 million, mostly Romanians and Slavs. It is the largest country in the Balkan Peninsula. Its territory was formed after the European war by combining the old Kingdom of Romania, Transylvania of Hungary, Bukovina of Austria, and Bessarabia of Imperial Russia, so it contains all kinds of contradictory and conflicting factors. For example, Bessarabia, which the Soviet Union naturally wanted to reclaim, finally achieved its goal in July 1940. The Danube River in Romania is the best waterway to the Black Sea and has always been coveted by Germany, and its agricultural products, such as wheat and corn, provide a good solution to Germany's food panic. As for the annual production of 6.6 million tons of oil, it is undoubtedly essential for the German war machine. Therefore, in the second half of last year, it finally succumbed to the gradual intrusion of German forces and declared complete surrender. This time, it acted as a tool for Germany's invasion of the two countries of South Greece.

Albania was originally Turkish territory before the First Balkan War. In the Treaty of London after that war, it became a kingdom. During the last European War, it stood on the side of the Allied forces and fought against Germany and Austria. As a result, with the support of Italy, it established a provisional government, which was only a puppet. After the war, its independent government announced its appearance; a revolution occurred in 1924, becoming a republic, but it soon became a monarchy until April 1939, when King Zog was in power. Italy invaded Albania on April 7, and since then it has become a territory of Italy. It has an area of only 10,000 square miles and a population of about one million, mostly Albanians. Tobacco is its main product, and agricultural and mineral products are not very abundant. The people are mostly Muslims and are very fond of fighting. The entire territory is mountainous. This time in the Italian-Greek war, most of the battlefield was in the southeastern mountain area, and the Italian army suffered continuous defeats due to geographical influences.

Bulgaria has an area of 39,000 square miles and a population of 6 million, mostly Slavs. The terrain is mostly mountainous highlands. In the First Balkan War, it united with Greece and Serbia and defeated Turkey; however, in the Second Balkan War the following year, it was defeated by Romania, Greece, Serbia, and others. In 1915, it stood on the side of Germany and fought against the Allied forces. In 1918, Germany was first defeated. In the 1919 Treaty of Neuilly, it ceded the territory of Macedonia to Greece and Yugoslavia, becoming the later Bulgaria. In terms of production, there is only agriculture and animal husbandry. After being invaded by Germany recently, it also acted as a tool for this invasion of South Greece.

Greece is a nation with a glorious and splendid history in the past. It has an area of 130,000 square miles and a population of 6.3 million. Historically, it has experienced many ups and downs; after the last war, the internal situation has been in an unstable state, until Metaxas became Prime Minister in 1938, it got on track. The terrain is mostly mountainous, and there are many islands in the south, with very diverse harbors. Due to its location, it occupies a very important position in the Near East and Southeastern Europe. Before the outbreak of this Balkan war, it was an ally of Britain and had a treaty relationship with Turkey. The people living in the mountainous areas are very warlike, and it was they who recently established the great victory of defeating the Italian army. Now it is one of the two main victims groaning under the iron hooves of the invading army.

Apart from Greece, another major victim of aggression is Yugoslavia. It has an area of 95,000 square miles and a population of 13.9 million. The nation is quite complex, containing Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Hungarians, Germans, Albanians, Bulgarians, Macedonians, and other nations. Languages, cultures, economic interests, etc. are all very complex and divergent, constituting its greatest weakness. The so-called Balkan Alliance, established in 1934, united with Greece, Turkey, Romania, etc., to resist external pressure. The main products also belong to agriculture, with only a small amount of lead and copper mines. Most of these are operated by Britain and France. In this war of resistance against aggression, it has joined hands with Greece. Currently, the only country in the Balkans standing outside the war is Turkey. But it can only be regarded as part of the European countries, while most of it is still in Asia, with a population of 16 million. In today's Balkans, in terms of strength, it is the leading country.

Looking at the various static situations mentioned above, one can roughly understand that although the Balkan countries were passively drawn into the vortex in this European war, their own complexity and chaos do have factors that induce war. The result of this European war will inevitably lead to another situation in the Balkans.

### Great War Achievements of the Chinese Army in Shanggao, Northern Jiangxi / Successful Completion of Two Encirclement Plans / Japanese Army's Blitzkrieg Tactics Suffer Defeat / Military Affairs Commission Issues a General Review of the Shanggao Campaign

Chongqing. A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that, while the Chinese armies in Guangdong and Anhui have won repeated victories this week, none are as worthy of note as the engagement in Shanggao, northern Jiangxi. The following is a record of the general review of the Shanggao campaign, drafted yesterday, followed by reports of other minor battles. Recently, Japan has been plotting to advance southward urgently but, feeling the weakness of their forces, they have only one option: to extract troops stationed in China and redeploy them to the south. However, they fear that, after the troops are withdrawn, the most vulnerable targets for Chinese attacks would be the exposed sections under the threat of the large Chinese army, yet they are unwilling to voluntarily abandon Yichang and Nanchang. Therefore, they sought to strike first, rashly launching an offense, hoping to inflict a blow on the Chinese army to facilitate the withdrawal of troops southward. This is the main reason for the recent activity of Japanese troops in Nanchang and Yichang. Little did they know that they had already been defeated in Yichang, and now they have suffered another major loss in northern Jiangxi.

"Course of the Campaign" (1) The Japanese first concentrated the main force of the Sakurai Division from the Wuning area and the entire Ikeda Composite Brigade of the Oga Division in the vicinity of Anyi and Nanchang before the 15th. On the 15th, the main force of the Sakurai Division attacked Fengxin from Anyi, then invaded westward along the Liao River basin. The Chinese Li army, relying on the high ground on both sides of the Liao River, inflicted blows on the Japanese army at every turn. On the 19th, in the Ganxu, Shangfuluo, and Luo Weijie areas, they launched a fierce pincer attack on the Japanese, inflicting 4,000 casualties. From the 19th, the Japanese retreated along the Liao River towards Anyi.

(2) On the 16th and 17th, the entire Oga Division of the Japanese army invaded westward from the north bank of the Jin River-Xiangjiang Highway, while the entire Ikeda Brigade crossed the Jin River from Nanchang, invading westward along the south bank of the Jin River, attempting to have the main force of the Sakurai Division defeat the Chinese Li army, then have the Oga and Ikeda units encircle the Wang army from both flanks. Unexpectedly, the Chinese Wang army used a portion of their forces east of the Tangpu River to delay the Japanese advance, while the main force transferred to Sixi and Tangpu, establishing pre-existing fortifications. The Li army pressed southward, and another two divisions of the Liu army were deployed to flank the Japanese army on the south bank of the Jin River.

(3) On the 20th and 21st, the Japanese Oga Division attacked the positions of the Chinese Wang army, and the Ikeda Brigade also crossed the Jin River from the vicinity of Zuobutou Street to the north, joining the Oga Division in a fierce assault on the positions of the Chinese Wang army. The small units of the Ikeda Brigade left behind on the south bank of the Jin River for reconnaissance and guard duty were completely annihilated by the Chinese Liu and Wang armies one after another in the vicinity of Xinshi Street and Tie Jiawei.

(4) From the 22nd, the entire Ikeda unit on the Japanese left flank attacked the right flank of the Chinese Wang army positions along the north bank of the Jin River. The main force of the Oga Division in the center advanced from Shihong Bridge towards Shanggao. On the right flank, a portion of the Oga Division, commanded by its infantry commander Iwanaga, attacked the Chinese left flank at Baimao Mountain, attempting to break through the Chinese positions, then head directly to Shanggao, pressing the Wang army against the Jin River to annihilate them. The Chinese Wang and Che armies, relying on pre-existing fortifications, engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese from the 22nd to the 25th. High grounds were repeatedly gained and lost. Despite the bombing by dozens of Japanese planes throughout the day, they continued to fight bravely. (5) Because of the Wang army's strong resistance for several days, the Japanese attempt to occupy Shanggao ultimately failed. Therefore, the Li and Han armies advancing from the north to the south, and the Liu army on the south bank of the Jin River, were able to gradually form an encirclement of the Japanese. From the 24th, the encirclement gradually shrank, and most of the Japanese army was trapped in the artillery fire. At dusk on the 24th, the Japanese began to break out, but they were fiercely intercepted by the Chinese army. The Japanese attempts to break out to the west and north all failed. Only over a thousand broke out to the vicinity of Huibu, but they were still intercepted and annihilated by more than half by the Chinese Wang army. The remnants retreated back into the encirclement.

(6) On the 25th, a Japanese reinforcement of 5,000 men rushed westward from Fengxin Qiqiao River Qianjie, attempting to join the Japanese forces surrounded by the Chinese, and advanced to the vicinity of Tangpu. That night, the Chinese once again completed an encirclement of the Japanese attempting to break out and the reinforcements and continued to attack the Japanese fiercely. On the 26th, Tangpu was captured, and they attacked Xiangguanqiao Nan Chaluo. On the 27th night, the Japanese unit retreated from Guanqiao Village and Street, and several thousand reinforcements covered their retreat in Nan Chaluo Guanqiao. The Chinese Tang Division set up ambushes in Qianjie Huchengwei, and two divisions of the Liu army set up ambushes in Yanggongwei Dounaowei and Ange Ge Shi Road to intercept the retreating Japanese army.

(7) On the 28th, the various units continued to attack the Japanese at Guanqiao and Chaluo fiercely. At 4 PM, the Japanese retreated in two columns towards Yanggongwei Qianjie and were fiercely intercepted by the Wang Tiehan unit at Longtuan Gong and the Wang Kejun Division at Songgongwei, suffering heavy casualties. Less than a thousand Japanese retreated eastward. There are about three reasons for this victory. First, the elimination of their flanks. The Japanese flanks were severely struck by the Chinese Li army, and their left flank was also repeatedly defeated by the Chinese Liu and Wang armies. Therefore, the Japanese central force was in a state of deep isolation. Second, the hindering of the Japanese main force. The Japanese emulated the German blitzkrieg tactics, disregarding the connection of their flanks, and the central force advanced single-mindedly, thinking that Shanggao could be taken in one fell swoop. Unexpectedly, the Chinese Wang army relied on pre-existing fortifications to delay the Japanese advance. After several days of hard fighting, the Japanese made no progress, and thus an encirclement could be formed. Third, unified command. Commander Luo Lei was calm, decisive, and dared to command appropriately. Therefore, under his unified guidance, he was able to achieve great success in annihilation.

Chinese Army's War Results: According to the figures recently reported from the front, these are only rough estimates, and the omissions and pending investigations are countless. They are temporarily announced as follows: Japanese officers and soldiers killed or wounded: over 24,000; prisoners captured: 72; Japanese warhorses killed: over 800; warhorses captured: 564; rifles seized: 2,304 (excluding those abandoned in the river that have not yet been recovered); artillery: 18 pieces; light machine guns: 96; smoke bombs: 30 boxes; poison gas canisters: 128; grenade launchers: 104; steel helmets: 144; gas masks: 192; other military supplies: countless. In addition to the above, the war situations in other areas are as follows:

Guangdong Area: The Japanese troops landing at Haifeng were constantly attacked by the Chinese army. Lufeng City was captured by the Chinese army on the night of the 31st. Hailan City is still surrounded by the Chinese army. Important outposts such as Shanwei and Houmen have already been captured. There are no major war situations in the war zones of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Anhui, Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Henan, so they are omitted. (11th Dispatch)

Chinese Military Circles Predict that the Japanese are About to Advance Southward

Chongqing. According to predictions in Chinese military circles, the Japanese army will advance southward within a month. Yesterday, a Chinese military spokesperson, in a reception for news reporters, responded to questions about the news of the withdrawal of Japanese troops and aircraft from Vietnam, saying that the Japanese troops have been transferred to Hainan or Taiwan, which is not yet known. However, according to recent intelligence, the number of warships and transport ships outside Hainan and Taiwan has increased. In recent weeks, the Japanese have not shipped large numbers of fresh troops or aircraft out of China, he said. The spokesperson then detailed the battle situation in northern Jiangxi, saying that the commander of the northern Jiangxi military was General Zhuo Ying. The northern wing of the Chinese army was defended by Li Zhuozhao, and the southern wing, that is, the defenses on the south bank of the Jin River, was the responsibility of the two divisions led by Wang Kequan and Wang Dehan, while the mountains northeast of Shanggao were guarded by Gan Yaowu. After the Chinese armies on the north and south routes repelled the Japanese army, they attacked the Japanese army northeast of Shanggao. In the fierce battle, a certain mountaintop was gained and lost up to eight times in three days. The Japanese suffered 20,000 casualties, while the Chinese soldiers suffered only half that number.

### British and Greek Troops Defend New Defense Line / Prepare for a Do-or-Die Battle with Germany / Greek Troops in Macedonia Withdraw in Good Order / Determined to Continue Fighting to Seek Final Victory

Athens. Greek rear guard troops resisted German mechanized units last night to slow their advance, enabling the main forces of the British and Greek armies to strengthen their defenses in preparation for the imminent Greek general battle. It is reported that although the fortresses of the Metaxas Line have been flattened, the Greek rear guard, although cut off east of Thessaloniki, resisted with exceptional ferocity. At the same time, the main forces of the British and Greek armies are digging into positions from the Aegean Sea to the Albanian border. As of last night, these two main forces had not yet engaged with the German army. The future battlefield where the outcome will be decided is in southern Macedonia. (United Press, 11th)

London. Athens Radio broadcast that the Greek troops engaged in rear guard actions in the Macedonia region had withdrawn in good order. The radio station also broadcast a Greek military communiqué stating that the Greek troops withdrawn west of Thessaloniki were intact and had now firmly defended the positions designated by the headquarters. The German army suffered heavy casualties from British air attacks. The number of British aircraft dispatched to the Balkan front has been increasing. The invading German army has also suffered very heavy casualties, and its mechanized and other military equipment has been severely damaged. (Reuters, 11th)

Athens. Government authorities declared yesterday that Greece would continue to fight "until final victory is achieved," and said that the Nazi advance could not compensate for their "terrible losses." (International News Service, 11th)

New York. The victorious Nazi troops marched into Zagreb, the capital of the province of Croatia, yesterday. Meanwhile, the British Expeditionary Force and the main force of the Greek army are reportedly about to encounter the German army in the final decisive battle in Greece. Military circles in London believe that although the situation in southern Greece is serious, there is no cause for despair. News from Athens recognizes that 80,000 Greek troops surrendered in Thrace, while reliable sources in London deny that the communication between the southern country's army and the Greek army has been cut off. Radio stations in Berlin and Rome were overjoyed with the German victories in the southern and Greek countries. Rome said that this great victory was, in fact, a great defeat for Britain and the United States. The Axis powers are determined to clear Yugoslavia within two weeks of blitzkrieg tactics, and then concentrate their forces on Greece, where they will engage with the elite troops of Britain. The terrain of Greece can be used as a springboard for the conquest of the Suez Canal, to coordinate with the German-Italian forces attacking the Suez from Libya. (United Press, 11th)

London. After Athens revealed that the Greek army had completely withdrawn from Thessaloniki, the German army occupied the city and discovered that the food had been completely removed. The military supplies, such as ammunition and gasoline, that the Western army did not have time to take away had been destroyed. It is reported that the main force of the Greek army is now concentrated on the second line of defense. This is the main defense line of the Greek side, starting from Mount Olympus (southwest of Thessaloniki) in the northeast to Lake Orestiada on the border of the southern country. It is widely believed that the British army is stationed there on the border of the southern country. The latest public communiqué from the Greek side acknowledges the German claim that the Greek troops in the eastern area of the Vardar River have surrendered their weapons. It is claimed that the Greek troops are still holding the Metaxas Line in the mountains on the Bulgarian border. The British Air Force is constantly attacking the enemy troops and motor vehicle convoys in the Duran Lake area (the area through which the German army is invading Thessaloniki), and the enemy motor vehicle convoys and bridges in northern Greece have also been heavily damaged by dive bombing, suffering heavy damage. An Athens newspaper commented that the entire Greece is now a fortress. The heroic achievements of the Greek army in the border fortresses over the past two days will be immortal. Greece will not yield at any cost and will continue to fight until the German-Italian regimes are defeated and the entire world is stabilized in a peaceful civilization. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the German claim that the communication between the Southern army and the Greek army has been cut off and that the Italian and German armies have joined forces in Albania is still one-sided and is intended to influence the plans of the Southern army's headquarters. According to sources in London who have received news from the Southern country, although the war situation is under great threat, there is no despair. The German side has deployed strong armored forces from Bulgaria to attack the Southern country, but their number is not very large. Only because they are well-equipped can they break through the Sevian line. The German army has obviously used a new type of tank, which can move freely not only on rough terrain but also has extremely thick armor that cannot be destroyed by ordinary rifles and machine-gun bullets. The Southern army is severely lacking in direct-fire artillery, so it is unable to resist the enemy's fierce artillery bombardment. However, in the previous great battle, the Southern army's situation was more precarious than it is today, but it was never disheartened and abandoned the struggle. (Reuters, 11th)

### Athens Suffers Cruel Air Raids

Athens. Last night, under a bright moon, German aircraft bombed Athens heavily. Waves of bombers came in large numbers, high in the clouds, and swooped down on targets in the harbor. Anti-aircraft guns on the ground fired loudly, dispersing them. There are no reports of any shipping losses. (United Press, 11th)

### Southern Country's Isolated Army Heroically Resists

Rome. A prisoner of war from Yugoslavia told a reporter from the "Southern Country News" that the Southern Country's army is now trying to build a new defense line on the Yingfa River and the Bosnia Mountains. Meanwhile, a message from Rome's "Papro News" says that the Southern Country's government has withdrawn from Sarajevo, the site of the assassination that sparked World War I in 1914. It is believed that King Peter II of the Southern Country is prepared to go to Turkey. (United Press, 11th)

Berlin. The German army is now closely pursuing the enemy troops withdrawing northwest from Niš. Several divisions of the Southern army were annihilated in central Serbia, and more than 10,000 people were captured, along with 70 artillery pieces and many other munitions. (Haitong News Agency, 11th)

Sofia.

### Traffic on the Romanian-Southern Border is Cut Off

Bucharest. A communiqué states that traffic on the Danube River, from Basiasia on the Viennese border to Bechet, a distance of three hundred miles, has been cut off. The reason for this is not yet clear. According to diplomatic reports, Southern Country's aircraft have been bombing the German army along the Danube River for several days. The Southern Country's engineers have sealed off the "Iron Gate" in the Danube River with cement at the bottom of the river. (United Press, 11th)

Bucharest. According to news from here yesterday, the Romanian city of Moldova on the Danube River was attacked by heavy artillery from the Southern Country. A bus from Orsova to Moldova, carrying forty passengers, was also strafed by machine guns from the Southern Country's army across the river, and three people were reportedly injured.

### Turkey's Crisis Approaches / Determined to Resist Aggression / Istanbul Begins Evacuating Residents / and Announces that Compatriots Abroad Must Enlist

London. The Turkish government is currently ordering the rapid evacuation of several thousand civilians from Istanbul, including children and the unemployed. Travel expenses will be subsidized by the government. Each person can carry 100 pounds of luggage, but must reserve train tickets or ship berths before the 15th. According to Turkish Radio, people may relocate anywhere in Turkey, but not to the four districts of Thrace, Izmir, Ankara, and Erzurum. The communiqué said that those evacuating are "people who do not do business or have occupations and who rely entirely on charitable handouts." The authorities have designated the interior of Anatolia province (in Asian Turkey) to accommodate the evacuees, so thousands of Turkish people will relocate there. Most of the Turkish civil and military officials and palace officials of the previous dynasty live in Istanbul. (Reuters, 11th)

Ankara. Although the general public in Turkey views the fall of Thessaloniki in Greece as a loss for Turkey, they believe that this is an "incidental event in the struggle," which has not diminished Turkey's determination to respond immediately if attacked, nor has it shaken Turkey's belief that Britain will eventually win. All the newspapers here published the news of the British army's occupation of Massawa in a prominent position. (Reuters)

Ankara. According to observers, the government's decision to evacuate residents is a clear sign of preparing to resist aggression, but it is not the government's intention to change its stance on the Balkan war. A cabinet meeting was convened on Tuesday (the 8th) to review the international situation, but the proceedings were not released. The next day, Foreign Minister Sarajoglu made a statement at a meeting of the People's Party, but the original text was also not disclosed. It is only known that he met with the British, French, and Spanish envoys afterwards for discussions. According to news from Istanbul, Turkey will still maintain the basic principle of not becoming involved in the vortex of war, but in adopting this defensive stance, it does not assume that it can forever avoid the spread of war. Therefore, in preparation for any eventuality, Istanbul Garrison Commander General Kidal has begun evacuating residents, in view of the fact that most of the city's houses are made of wood. (Havas, 10th)

Budapest. Admiral Horthy, Regent of Hungary, yesterday ordered the three armies to fight bravely. The order said: Hungarian soldiers, compatriots, people of the same race who have been forced to separate from us for many years and cannot enjoy a common political life, now we bear a heavy responsibility and must provide them with assistance. I am confident that you will abide by military discipline and fulfill the morality and obligations of a soldier. The hearts of the entire nation are on you. Strive forward and reach the southern border of Hungary a thousand years ago. I believe that you will quickly complete this new mission. May you all strive forward! (Haitong News Agency, 11th)

Budapest. Hungarian Regent Horthy issued a communiqué this morning, saying that Hungary has decided to place the territory ceded to Yugoslavia during World War I under Hungarian protection. Now that the situation has changed, the agreement signed between Hungary and Yugoslavia in September last year was signed with the government of that country in a spirit of peace. However, on March 26 of this year, the government of the Southern Country was changed. The officials of the new government of the Southern Country have no determination to maintain peace and to maintain good neighborly relations, and have clashed with Germany and the two countries. The new regime of the Southern Country has also deployed troops on the Hungarian border. The Hungarian government did not take self-defense measures until after being bombed several times and realizing that the Southern Country's army had attempted to break into Hungarian territory. Therefore, Hungary has decided to recover the territory ceded to the Southern Country in 1918 and protect the Hungarian people in that territory. This is the sacred obligation of the nation, so I ordered the Hungarian army to take self-defense measures on the 10th. This action is not directed against the Serbian people. Our country has no conflict with Serbia and is willing to live peacefully with it in the future. (Haitong News Agency, 11th)

### Croatia Province Declares Independence from Yugoslavia; German Troops Enter Zagreb; Puppet Government Organized and Established

Berlin: According to the German High Command, German armored vehicles entered Zagreb, the capital of Croatia Province, last night. (November 11, Havas dispatch)

Berlin: It is reported here that Zagreb is the second largest city in Yugoslavia, with a population of 190,000. Before the World War, it was the capital of the Kingdom of Croatia within the Kingdom of Hungary. After the establishment of the Croatia-Serbia Agreement in August 1939, it was reorganized as Croatia Province, with Zagreb as its capital, housing a university and many factories. (November 11, Havas dispatch)

Berlin: The German official news agency stated that after the occupation of Zagreb, Croatia Province has declared itself an "independent state." A Croatian general named Kvaternik broadcast a message on the Zagreb radio station last night, instructing civil and military officials to swear allegiance to the "new state." (November 11, Havas dispatch)

London: Well-informed sources here claim that Berlin's announcement of the independence of Croatia Province in Yugoslavia shows that the German side intends to separate the Croats from Yugoslavia and establish a puppet government in Croatia Province, headed by the Croatian traitor Pavelić. Pavelić is the leader of the Macedonian terrorist group that assassinated King Alexander of Yugoslavia. When the German side began its invasion of Yugoslavia, Pavelić openly declared his support for the Axis powers. (November 11, Reuters dispatch)

### British Prime Minister Churchill's Speech Welcomed by Vichy; Britain Allows Food to Be Shipped to the Free Zone; France Resolves Not to Transfer Warships to Other Countries

Vichy: The French government is quite pleased with British Prime Minister Churchill's speech in the House of Commons. It also appreciates the British Prime Minister's expression of willingness to allow food to pass through the British blockade to various Mediterranean ports as much as possible for the French Free Zone. At the same time, a certain French authoritative spokesman reiterated Marshal Pétain's previous promise that French military bases and warships would never be transferred to any foreign country for use in attacking Britain. Regarding Churchill's statement that Britain allows food to be transported through the blockade to the French Free Zone, but does not allow the transport of any goods that Britain suspects may be transported to Germany and Italy, the spokesman replied that what France requires is barley and some essential goods for the survival of the people in the Free Zone before the harvest season arrives. Any barley allowed by Britain to be transported to the French Free Zone will not cause the quantity produced in the occupied zone to be diverted to support Germany and Italy, because barley is almost non-existent in France, even in the occupied zone, which accounts for 84% of France's barley source. The French government is very willing to accept any reasonable management method of neutral countries to assure the British government that any food passing through the blockade will not fall into the hands of Britain's enemies. The spokesman also said that Hitler had recently made a guarantee that Germany would not interfere with any food transported to the French Free Zone, and would not use confiscation or requisition to transport it to Germany. Regarding Churchill's statement that France respects its promises and will not transfer its warships to Germany, but is afraid that the German High Command will exert pressure on the French government to force it to hand over the fleet anchored in African ports, the spokesman gave a very firm answer. The spokesman said that on the day of the armistice, Marshal Pétain guaranteed that France would not grant any foreign country the use of the French fleet, whether individually or as a whole, to attack Britain. France has now reiterated this promise and will fulfill this promise regardless of any pressure. (November 11, United Press dispatch)

### Ethiopian Capital Flies Tricolor Lion Flag; British Troops Assisted by Patriotic Ethiopian Forces Pursue Retreating Italian Troops in Three Routes

London: A Reuters correspondent in Addis Ababa reported that the tricolor lion flag of King Selassie of Ethiopia is now hoisted high on the Parliament building. At the flag-raising ceremony, the British military commander addressed representatives of the Ethiopian people, saying, "There are still many things to be done, and the speed of doing them depends on the Ethiopian people. Therefore, I ask the Ethiopian people not only to maintain local security, but also to defend against external attacks. Can you give me this guarantee?" The crowd replied in unison, "Yes." The proclamation issued by King Selassie on March 17 was also announced at the same time. The proclamation allows the British military commander to issue proclamations related to the war after consulting with Ethiopian leaders. (November 11, Reuters dispatch)

Cairo: A Reuters correspondent in Addis Ababa reported that British troops, assisted by patriotic Ethiopian forces, are currently pursuing Italian troops on three routes in Eritrea and Ethiopia. After occupying Massawa, British troops left a small detachment of soldiers to quickly deploy defenses, while mobile units continued south to attack the remaining Italian troops concentrated in Dessie (150 miles northeast of the Ethiopian capital). The London War Office issued a statement stating that British troops in Eritrea and Ethiopia are continuing to put pressure on the retreating Italian troops. There has been no change in the Libyan war. The British Air Force also issued a statement stating that a large sandstorm in the Libyan desert has hindered the activities of the British Air Force, but British aircraft are still attacking the advancing German and Italian troops, inflicting heavy damage on them. After the British troops occupied Addis Ababa, they discovered the wreckage of 31 damaged enemy aircraft at the city's airfield, some of which were reportedly still repairable and usable. The Air Force statement said that South African Air Force bombers were engaged in offensive patrols over the Aselle district in Ethiopia yesterday, destroying enemy buildings and motor vehicle garages. Nairobi officially announced that British troops captured 5,000 enemy troops in Addis Ababa, including 4,000 Italian soldiers and 1,000 native soldiers. On Wednesday, a British patrol captured more than 1,000 Italian soldiers and more than 900 non-Italian soldiers. Two British officers led a small detachment of South African troops and also captured 800 Italian soldiers in Ashawa. Several large detachments of retreating Italian troops hundreds of miles west of the Ethiopian capital were severely attacked by a detachment of patriotic Ethiopian vehicles and are now fleeing towards the Blue Nile River, where they are being attacked by two British troops. The remaining Italian troops led by General Santini were cut off in the Adama district, 40 miles southeast of the Ethiopian capital, and are now being pursued across the Awash River by Negrelli's troops. Although the Italian troops attempted to use artillery fire to stop the British troops, they were eventually driven into the Arussi Mountains, and their hope of regaining contact with the Italian troops led by General Gazzera in the north is slim.

Three British Generals Missing in Libyan Campaign

Cairo: British military headquarters in Cairo issued a statement yesterday stating that British troops east of Benghazi have concentrated and are preparing for battle. In recent days, British troops have inflicted heavy damage on the enemy during their retreat. Some British soldiers have also been captured, and several senior officers are missing. Among the missing is Major General O'Connor, a key aide to General Wavell. O'Connor led the 13th Corps and made great contributions when British troops crossed Cyrenaica and occupied Benghazi. Other missing senior officers include Lieutenant General Neame, former commander of the British forces in Palestine, and Major General Prieulle, who led the British military mission to Greece when Italian troops attacked Greece. According to a German statement, after fierce fighting in North Africa, Derna has been occupied, and Mechelli, 50 miles south of Derna, has also been captured by Italian and German troops. Six British generals, two colonels, and 2,000 soldiers have been captured. However, Cairo claims that the number of prisoners captured in the encounters cannot reach 2,000.

### Heavy Losses for Italian Naval, Land, and Air Forces; More Than Half of Aircraft Lost

New York: The "New York Post" carried an article by critic Walter, which stated that at the beginning of the war, Italy had 3,500 aircraft, but in the ten months after the start of the war, it had lost 1,600 aircraft and failed to manufacture new aircraft to replenish them. Therefore, the Italian Air Force is no longer taken seriously. According to the Italian News Agency, the losses of the Italian naval, land, and air forces in March of this year totaled 21,565 people, including 2,457 missing, 3,400 dead, and 8,690 wounded. On the Greek front alone, 2,102 Italian soldiers were killed, 6,031 wounded, and 7,483 missing in March. (November 11, Reuters dispatch)

### British Aircraft Swarm Under Moonlight; Fierce Attack on Central Berlin; Thousands of Tons of Bombs Dropped Causing Significant Damage; Nazi Air Force Retaliates with Extensive Attacks on Britain

London: According to the British Air Ministry, the British Air Force launched its 39th attack on Berlin since the start of the war on Wednesday night, lasting three hours. Most of the high-explosive bombs dropped exploded in the central area of Berlin, and large fires broke out frequently. The German official news agency also admitted that many houses were destroyed and some people were killed or injured. The palace where Frederick the Great lived and the New Palace in Potsdam were both hit by bombs. The Prussian National Library and the Grand Theater were also burned down. Although the air raid on Berlin this time was not as intense as the one suffered by Danzig a few days ago, it was still severely destroyed. Several places in Emden in northwestern Germany were also attacked that night. Large-scale air raids were also carried out on Denmark, Norway, and the occupied areas of France during the day. Eight British aircraft did not return. Berlin has strengthened its air defenses since the last attack, but British bombers were still able to launch an attack on the center of Berlin with thousands of tons of high-explosive bombs and countless incendiary bombs on a moonlit night and when Berlin's defenses were aligned. The German High Command's statement described the British aircraft's major attack on Berlin, saying that high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs fell on residential areas and the central area, causing much damage, and that public buildings of historical and cultural significance, such as churches and museums, were also hit. In terms of the weight of the bombs dropped, the number of civilian casualties was relatively small. (November 11, Reuters dispatch)

London: For the third consecutive night on Wednesday, German aircraft extensively attacked various parts of Britain, with the manufacturing centers of military supplies in Birmingham and the port of Newcastle as important targets. The western part of the Midlands was also heavily bombed. Shops and houses were severely damaged, and the number of deaths and injuries is feared to be high. Fires broke out in several places. Anti-aircraft fire was heavy on the northeast coast, but German aircraft droned on all night. Material damage and casualties are expected to be significant. However, German aircraft lost at least eleven aircraft that night. (November 12, Reuters dispatch)

Berlin: On the previous two nights, German aircraft bombed the Birmingham industrial area, which was even more intense than the bombing of the area last month. German aircraft flew continuously and bombed designated targets. Fires broke out in many places, and the flames lit up the sky, which could be seen from a hundred miles away. Hundreds of German aircraft participated in the bombing, and many munitions factories and aircraft factories were hit by bombs and destroyed. (November 11, Havas dispatch)

### Provisional Municipal and Provincial Assembly Organizations to Remain Unchanged for Now; Only Term Limits Revised; County Assembly Organization Law to Be Promulgated

Chongqing: Regarding the extension of the term of office of the provisional municipal and provincial assembly councilors, which relates to the term of office of the public opinion organs of various provinces and cities, the reporter specially went to the Executive Yuan to inquire about the cause. The person in charge said that the government established provisional municipal and provincial assemblies in various provinces and cities during the anti-Japanese construction period. Various provinces and cities followed the ordered organizational regulations and were established in the spring of the year before last, totaling seventeen provinces and one city. By the beginning of last year, the terms of office of the members of the assemblies had expired one after another. Except for Henan Province, which decided to hold a re-election, the rest extended the terms of office by one year in accordance with the organizational regulations. Now, the terms of office of the councilors of the provisional municipal and provincial assemblies in various provinces are about to expire successively, and the regulations that allow for a one-year extension of term of office can no longer be extended. Various provinces have telegraphed to inquire. In recent years, the government has been actively promoting the new county system, one of the main items of which is the establishment of county assemblies. Last year, the Executive Yuan drafted organizational regulations for county assemblies and election regulations for county assembly councilors, which stipulated the organization of county assemblies and the election methods of county assembly councilors in great detail. These draft regulations are currently under review by the Legislative Yuan and will be officially promulgated in the near future. The government believes that the municipal and provincial public opinion organs and the county and municipal public opinion organs are a single, unified system. Therefore, the organization of municipal and provincial and county and municipal public opinion organs is related to each other. Before the organization of the county and municipal public opinion organs and the election methods have been officially decided, it is not appropriate to decide on the organization of the municipal and provincial provisional assembly first. For this reason, in order to avoid many changes, the government will temporarily keep the existing organizational regulations for provisional municipal and provincial assemblies unchanged, and only revise the regulations regarding the term of office, namely, Article 1 of the organizational regulations for provisional provincial assemblies and Article 10 of the organizational regulations for provisional municipal assemblies, and change the term of office of the assembly councilors to "The term of office of the councilors of the provisional municipal and provincial assemblies is one year. The Executive Yuan may extend it if it deems it necessary." This approach is entirely a temporary measure, or it can be said to be a transitional measure. The Executive Yuan has now drafted amendments to the organizational regulations for provincial and municipal provisional assemblies. Once the organizational regulations and election regulations for county assemblies are promulgated, the amendment of the organizational regulations for provisional municipal assemblies can be completed and implemented. At that time, the councilors of the various provincial and municipal provisional assemblies will be re-elected in accordance with the new laws, so as to complete the consistent system of provincial and county public opinion organs.

Foreign flour has also arrived in Shanghai. The Jardine Matheson steamer "Dingsheng" arrived in port yesterday morning. In addition to a large quantity of foreign rice from Hong Kong, there were also 1,997 bags of flour and 561 bags of bran.

### Sugar Market: Active Futures Trading

The sugar market trend was still tight yesterday, and futures trading was extremely active, so the tight situation is not easy to relax. The association's closing price for spot goods was 24 coarse white, 90 yuan to 80 yuan and 8 jiao, up 1 yuan and 8 jiao. Futures on April 20 first rose by 1 yuan to 90 yuan and 6 jiao, and then eased slightly to close at 90 yuan. New trading at the end of April has also begun, with prices ranging from 91 and a half yuan to 90 yuan and 8 jiao. Taikoo granulated white B mark West Wharf 91 and a half yuan, up 5 jiao, DY mark East Wharf 84 and a half yuan.

### Cotton Yarn: U.S. and Indian Cotton Both Rise

The New York American cotton telegram said that the market was lively and prices were high, because colleagues and Wall Street stock traders were buying, resulting in a rise. As a result, the closing price was 12 to 16 points per pound higher than the previous day.

The Bombay Indian cotton telegram said that prices rose because speculators bought Bairoe and Yamla cotton, and shorts covered their positions. As a result of the closing, it was 1 to 4 rupees higher than the previous day.

### Coal: Indian Anthracite Coal Rises Steadily; Old Orders Rare as Hen's Teeth

The various grades of anthracite coal are being searched for everywhere by Japanese street traders, and old orders on the market are as rare as hen's teeth. And the merchants are holding back and not selling, with very little flowing out. Under this current state, it is naturally difficult to ask for a surge in prices. Therefore, the dark price is rising steadily, day by day. Yesterday, Indian anthracite coal was bid at 390 yuan, and sized chunks were 412 yuan, delivered to customers, including merchant commissions.

### Metals: Rebar Steel Bars Firm and High

Rebar steel bars are in demand, with construction gangs purchasing them daily, coupled with the interruption of overseas sources. Therefore, the holders of goods are thinking highly. Although the standard market has no large sales volume, it is still relatively firm and high. It was found that yesterday's market asking price was 3,500 yuan per ton for three- and four-point grades, and 3,400 yuan per ton for five-point to one-inch grades, both of which were several tens of yuan higher than before. The customers are feeling a pinch in their wallets.

### Plain Galvanized Iron Sheets Flourish

The 37-inch and 36-inch plain galvanized iron sheets circulating in the market are flourishing because the hoarding gangs have revived, and the factory's output is not enthusiastic. At the same time, the construction gangs and retail users are still keen, so the market is very buoyant. The market has suddenly become popular. The 37-inch sheets are sold for 24 yuan per sheet, and the 36-inch sheets are bid for 22 yuan per sheet, up 5 jiao to 1 yuan from before.

### Miscellaneous: Mid- to High-Grade Cigarettes Show Different Trends

The market price of mid-range cigarettes is bleak because of narrow actual sales and abundant inventory, making it difficult for prices to rise. However, the market for high-end cigarettes is tight. The factory's distribution of goods is scarce and cannot supply a large amount of sales to the market. The market is relatively smooth, and the buying price is gradually reaching upward. Yesterday, for example, the opening price of ten large Qianmen brand cigarettes was 400 yuan per 10,000 cigarettes, the price of fifty large Qianmen brand cigarettes was 366 yuan per 10,000 cigarettes, the price of ten large Cannon brand cigarettes was 640 yuan per 10,000 cigarettes, the price of fifty large Cannon brand cigarettes was 700 yuan per 10,000 cigarettes, and the price of twenty large Nanwei cigarettes was 985 yuan per 10,000 cigarettes. Because of a work stoppage by workers, the Jinzitata brand cigarettes held by the Fuxin Company were bid at 705 yuan.

### Northern and Southern Cargoes Arrive Frequently

Imports: Yesterday there were 115 pieces of piece goods, 15 pieces of tea, 82 pieces of wool, and 66 pieces of cowhide, all transported from Hong Kong.

Exports: Today, 260 bags of soybeans, 545 pieces of piece goods, and 30 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong; 800 pieces of tea and 1,000 pieces of galvanized iron were transported to Tianjin; and 10 pieces of piece goods were transported to Weihaiwei.

### Medicinal Materials: Fox Nuts Soar

The market price of fox nuts is rising daily because both arrivals and inventory are scarce. The market price has risen from 85 yuan to 96 yuan. Yesterday, it broke through the 100 yuan mark, opening at 118 yuan. 56 packages were traded, a sharp increase of 22 yuan, which can be described as extremely firm.

### Seaweed and Laver

— Li Shuyong

Seaweed and laver are two common dried vegetables. In the plant kingdom, they belong to the lowest category called "algae." This category usually consists of tiny and insignificant plants that most people are unfamiliar with. Only seaweed and laver, because they are used as food for humans, allow us to immediately think of what kind of plants they are when we mention their names.

Seaweed is kelp. In our country's history, it is considered to have been around for a very long time. Our country does not have cold currents, so seaweed cannot reproduce. However, according to ancient books, it may have reproduced at one time. Tao Hongjing said, "Kelp now only comes from Goryeo, tied like hemp ropes, with a yellowish-black color, soft and edible." Li Xun of the Tang Dynasty said, "That from Silla has thin, yellowish-black leaves. The Hu people make ropes from it, dry it in the shade, and bring it to China on ships." At this time, it was still an imported product. By the time of the "Jia You Materia Medica" of the Song Dynasty, it was said, "It is soft, pliable, and long. Now, people of Dengzhou dry it to bundle objects." At that time, it was probably already very common. The "Compendium of Materia Medica" says there is a type that "comes from Fujian and Zhejiang, with large leaves resembling vegetables," which may not even be seaweed. Nowadays, almost all the seaweed on the market is not domestically produced.

The body of seaweed has a very complex structure. The outer layer is the cortex, and the center is a loose medulla. The cortex has many mucilage ducts inside, and the medulla also has vascular bundles connected to it. This cortex can grow annually, like the annual rings of trees. During the reproductive period, many spore sacs develop on the surface. The spores are shed and grow into extremely fine filaments. Only sexual reproduction allows them to grow into ordinary seaweed. In the past, people thought that seaweed only had asexual reproduction. The discovery of these fine filaments is less than thirty years old.

The harvesting period for seaweed is from July to September. The harvesters tie a sickle to a bamboo pole and go to places where it grows abundantly to cut it. The cut seaweed is laid on the sand to let the moisture evaporate. After four or five days, it is stored indoors and covered with bamboo mats. Soon, a sheen and white salt appear on the surface, then it is moved to the sunlight to dry, remove the hemp, sand, and then it can be sold. Its uses are for food, iodine production, and raw material for sodium carbonate. In places where it is abundant, it is also used as rope for bundling objects or as fertilizer.

Laver grows best where river water enters shallow seas. In January and February, brownish spots appear on the surface, inside of which sexual reproductive organs develop. After fertilization, it becomes eight small, naked plant bodies. In September, asexual sporangia develop on the surface, each sac producing one spore. After maturity, it floats freely in the water, attaches to other objects and germinates. In winter, it grows rapidly, developing into a complete leaf-like thallus.

The laver in the southern provinces of our country comes in two types: Porphyra suborbiculata and P. tenera. The best varieties include Dongshan laver, Donghu laver (produced in Shantou), and Tonggu laver from Wenchang County, Hainan Island. The method of cultivating laver involves inserting stems of bamboo or chumaerea into the sea mud between September and November, allowing the spores to attach to them. In February and March of the following year, laver develops on the poles. However, sometimes, due to the effects of tides or flowing water, they may attach but not germinate. Therefore, the best method is to divide the attachment and growth into two steps: first cultivate the new laver in a suitable place, allowing it to produce spores, which attach to wood. After it has grown a little, insert it into shallow seas to allow it to grow and multiply. If there is abundant rainfall during the growth period, the quality becomes very good.

From late winter to early summer is the most prolific period for laver. The harvesting of laver also takes place at this time. The harvested laver is washed clean, cut, and soaked in fresh water to dilute the salt. It is then strained with bamboo sieves, dried in the sun, stacked in layers, tied with rope, and then sealed with paper and dried in a roasting oven. This turns it black, which is the dried laver sold on the market.

Seaweed and laver contain iodine, which can be used as a treatment for goiter. The widespread knowledge of the thyroid gland is a recent thing, but records of seaweed treating goiter already existed in our country. It is said that the "Shen Nong's Herbal Classic," which was probably produced in the Han and Wei dynasties, says, "Seaweed tastes bitter and cold, and it mainly treats goiter, lumps under the neck, and breaks up knotted qi..." The "Zhaoqing Prefecture Gazetteer" says, "Laver grows in the Yangjiang sea. Eating it can detoxify from sea poisons." Although they didn't know about the thyroid gland, they just thought "qi," "goiter," and "poison" were the culprits. But in terms of drug discovery achievements, that is very great. In the past, some of our friends from eastern Zhejiang who went to the interior developed goiter and wrote letters asking for seafood. At first, we brought dried shrimp, but it was very inconvenient. Later, we came up with a method: we rolled up "laver cakes" and sent them as printed matter. This can be considered an anecdote about the use of laver.

The tissue of the petiole of seaweed has the property of absorbing water and swelling. In the past, it was used in surgery to dilate narrow parts and wounds, but now there are better medicines that can replace it. Also, according to Hao Yixing's "Notes on Sea Creatures," "There are many edible grasses in the sea, but only this one is not. The locals call it 'dai (belt)' because of its shape. The leaves are like ophiopogon and long, produced on the seabed, tall enough to hide a person. The roots are like thatch and slightly shorter between the nodes, sweet and crisp to chew, like grass. The fishermen dive into the water to pick it, piling it up like mountains. It is originally bluish-green, turns black when dried in the sun, and white again after frost. It is bundled and carried home. Using it to thatch houses in cold regions is better than thatching with thatch, because it avoids fire and can last a long time, even after repeated autumn rains, it will not rot, a miraculous thing! In seaside villages, it is bright as far as the eye can see." This also shows a glimpse of the ancient situation of not eating seaweed and its utilization!

### Towels

— Guo Xiushi

(Continued from the 7th)

Towels and handkerchiefs are also a type that people enjoy using. A small square can be quite exquisite.

As mentioned earlier, the manufacturing process of towels involves a distinction between "raw yarn" and "cooked yarn." Therefore, the procedures for manufacturing towels must be discussed separately:

The manufacturing procedure for "raw yarn" towels is very simple: the cotton yarn is sized, made into yarn shafts, and then the towel can be woven. Once the towel is woven, it can be directly immersed in bleaching powder water to bleach, dried in the sun, and then it's done. "Cooked yarn" towels are different. The cotton yarn used initially requires a "degreasing method," in which the cotton yarn is placed in a low-pressure pot, boiled with caustic soda solution to remove the cotton grease, and then washed with clean water mixed with sulfuric acid. After the cooked cotton yarn is cleaned, it is sized, made into yarn shafts, and then the towel can be woven. Once the towel is woven, it must be bleached. The bleaching steps are also very complicated, as described below:

1. Desizing: Before bleaching, the towel must be desized. The desizing procedure involves placing the towel in a pot, boiling it with caustic soda solution, and then washing it with clean water mixed with sulfuric acid.

2. Bleaching: The desized towel is placed in a bleaching powder water tank and immersed for two or three hours (this time depends on the concentration of the bleaching water, the warmth of the weather, the equipment, etc.). After bleaching, it is washed with clean water mixed with sulfuric acid.

3. Soaping: After bleaching, industrial soap is put into a pot of clean water and boiled. The bleached towel is then soaked in it, taken out, and washed with clean water mixed with sulfuric acid until clean.

In this way, after many precise and careful procedures, the towel is clean, white, and tender. Then, it is dried in a hot water drying machine, flattened, and after the procedures of packaging and decoration, it can be sold.

The manufacturing of "cooked yarn" towels is as cumbersome as described above, but its main advantages are "softness" and "water absorption"!

Some say: "Raw yarn" towels are inexpensive and durable. It is also said that "raw yarn" towels do not have the cotton yarn's fatty substances boiled away, and they are not bleached very thoroughly, so the color is slightly rough. On the surface, they look inferior, not visually appealing. However, its texture is undamaged, and it is durable and washable. "Cooked yarn" towels are bleached very thoroughly, and after many boiling and refining procedures, the cotton grease is boiled away, reducing the "tensile strength" of the cotton yarn, and the strong "core" is softly dissolved! (To be continued)

### Large Transaction of Foreign Rice

Investigation of Rice Reserves Unsuccessful Due to Martial Law in Hongkou; Transactions for 200,000 Bags of Rice Completed Within a Week

The Rice and Grain Trade Association's investigation of rice reserves in Chinese and foreign warehouses this week has not yet been officially completed as of yesterday. According to the person in charge of the association, the investigation could not be carried out for the past two days due to the Japanese martial law in Hongkou. Therefore, the investigation of rice reserves this week must be postponed until next Thursday or Friday. However, according to the estimation of the person in charge of the association, the amount of rice reserves in Chinese and foreign warehouses this week has increased by about 20,000 to 30,000 bags compared to last week, because the sales were sluggish at the end of last week and the beginning of this week, and the supply was abundant.

Transaction of Foreign Rice: General legitimate rice merchants in this city, in order to plan ahead and increase the reserves in their rice warehouses, have successively entrusted British-owned Jardine Matheson, French-owned D'Arfeuille, Swedish-owned Forsberg, and Japanese-owned Nisshin to telegraph various rice-producing regions overseas to order large quantities of foreign rice, so that they can be shipped to Shanghai in sequence to adjust the market. It is reported that within this week, approximately 200,000 bags of foreign rice have been telegraphed for transactions, with the transaction price being approximately 125 yuan per bag (one stone and two and a half dou) including military transportation fees. Rice merchants claim that the foreign rice is expected to arrive at the port in early next month. Also, general rice merchants are still actively negotiating and continuing to order large quantities of foreign rice.

Use of Ordered Rice: The Shanghai Food Cooperation Association welcomes the ordering of foreign rice by citizens and, after registering and reaching a certain quantity, entrusts various foreign firms to telegraph foreign rice-producing regions to complete transactions and arrange for shipment to Shanghai. Although ordering has been temporarily suspended, registration continues, and once overseas shipping is smooth, transactions can be telegraphed. It is now learned that the association has printed and distributed survey forms to participating subscribers to clarify the purpose of ordering rice, instructing them to fill them out and return them to the association immediately to understand the purpose of their rice orders, fearing that the ordered rice will be hoarded. It is also learned that the association's fourth batch of ordered rice has been completely distributed after being shipped in batches.

### Opening of Aurora University Photographic Society's Hygiene Exhibition

The Aurora University Photographic Society, in order to instill hygiene knowledge and promote the health of city residents, held a "Public Hygiene Propaganda Photo Exhibition" in the university's auditorium on Rue Lutetia during the school's spring break. The exhibition aimed to promote methods for preventing tuberculosis, cancer, syphilis, trachoma, and other infectious diseases, which are the most serious problems in China. The exhibition opened yesterday morning, and the venue featured various pathological photos, models, specimens, and X-ray films, which were very eye-catching and temporarily included brief explanations. It is said that more than 4,000 people from all walks of life visited yesterday, and many groups and schools have made arrangements to visit, so the audience is expected to be even more crowded in the next four days. The society's exhibition is entirely aimed at serving the community, with open exhibitions and no tickets sold. The exhibition dates are from the 11th to the 15th, from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM daily.

### Russian Émigrés Plan to Establish a Large Amusement Park

Proposing to the Taxpayers' Meeting Next Spring: A Russian émigré in this city, Kairsaloff, plans to propose at the Taxpayers' Annual Meeting next spring the construction of an amusement park worth 8 million yuan in the International Settlement. It is rumored that the relevant parties believe that this plan may be approved by the next Taxpayers' Meeting because it is quite beneficial to the taxpayers. The proposed amusement park will donate 30 percent of its annual income to the Municipal Council. According to the plan, this donation will bring in as much as one million yuan each year. According to Kairsaloff's plan, the amusement park would be the largest in Shanghai, accommodating 10,000 spectators. All performances in the park would be new types never seen in this city before. Its location may be near Bubbling Well Road. If the amusement park is established, the Canidrome and Jai Alai Stadium in the French Concession will be greatly affected. According to a friend of Kairsaloff, if this matter can be approved by the Taxpayers' Meeting next spring, the charity work in this city will benefit greatly because a portion of the park's income will be donated to charity. Kairsaloff and his companions will soon complete the planned proposal for large-scale promotion.

### Apartments Restrict Elevator Use; Residents Must Walk Downstairs

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that apartments in the two settlements are now restricting the use of elevators and asking residents to walk up or down the stairs for lower floors to save electricity. For example, the Embankment Building notified residents yesterday (the 10th) that they must walk up or down the stairs for the first three floors. Other apartments have also taken similar actions.

### Shanghai Postal Administration Issues Salary Advances to Postal Workers

Due to financial difficulties, postal employees of the Shanghai Postal Administration and its branches jointly submitted a request to the Directorate General of Posts for an additional monthly living allowance of 100 yuan per person from the two Shanghai postal workers' unions. Because of the Directorate General of Posts provided not a definite answer, the matter has been delayed until now and has not been resolved satisfactorily. However, in view of the rising prices and the increasingly difficult living conditions of its members, the two postal workers' unions telegraphed the Directorate General of Posts, requesting a salary advance. On the 3rd of this month, the Directorate General of Posts replied, approving a temporary loan of half a month's salary to each person. The amount of the temporary loan will be deducted from the salary for May, and those with salaries less than 50 yuan will also receive 50 yuan. It is now learned that the Shanghai Postal Administration issued the salary advance separately on the 10th of this month. In order to alleviate the suffering of its members as soon as possible, the two postal workers' unions are continuing to telegraph the Directorate General of Posts to fight for the best outcome.

### British and American Émigrés Express Dissatisfaction with the Municipal Council's Organizational Changes; Unanimously Believe It Damages Traditional Prestige; Chinese Taxpayers Await Instructions from the Provisional Capital

The reorganization of the "Provisional Council" of the Municipal Council provoked a negative reaction among British and American émigrés yesterday. It is said that "British and Americans have the greatest traditional interests in Shanghai, which is undeniable, and the organization of the Municipal Council has always favored British and Americans, which is also undeniable. This superior position has long been coveted by the Japanese, which is even more undeniable. The Japanese have long intended to change the status quo of the settlement, first seen in last year's launch of five candidates, then in this year's shooting of Katsuji by Rin Yuukichi, and now the establishment of the 'Provisional Council' has achieved their plan. The legitimate interests of British and Americans in Shanghai are in danger of being overturned. What we must say is that the consultations between the British and American consuls and the Japanese consul-general, as well as the behind-the-scenes negotiations between the British Association and the Japanese Residents' Association, are merely the 'dictatorial acts' of officials and responsible persons, and do not represent the public opinion of all British and American émigrés. No matter how the authorities defend themselves, we must express our solemn opposition to this act of creating a 'fait accompli' in terms of maintaining prestige and rights."

### Chinese Obey Instructions from the Provisional Capital

The "North-China Daily News" reports that the Central Government in Chongqing has remained silent on the issue of the Municipal Council's board elections. Chinese taxpayers in the International Settlement are anxious because they do not know what the government's attitude is and are awaiting news and instructions from the Provisional Capital. According to Chinese sources, although no official instructions have been received, Chongqing must have held consultations on this issue. On this point, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, who recently left Shanghai for Chongqing, should be able to help Chinese government officials clearly understand the situation here.

Re-election of Chinese Directors Completely Legal: Regarding the Chinese directors and committee members attending the Shanghai Municipal Council for the Republic of China's 30th year (1941), five people, Yu Qiaqing, Xi Yushu, Chen Tingrui, Yuan Lüdeng, and Guo Shun, were proposed to continue as Chinese directors and six people, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Guanqun, Li Wenjie, Liu Shifang, Jin Tongyin, and Zhao Chuanding, were proposed to continue as Chinese committee members, and Jin Zongcheng was proposed to continue as a land committee member in January of this year by the legally organized Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, based on a written proposal signed jointly by a majority of 42 representatives. After receiving the notice from the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, the Municipal Council officially replied to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association on February 14, accepting the proposal and officially announcing it on the same evening through the information department. Therefore, the positions of the Chinese directors and committee members are legally valid and undeniable. Although some of the Chinese directors and committee members have left Shanghai, it is not permanent, so there is no need to hold another election. According to legal principles and customs, the Chinese directors can take office and attend the board of directors after the foreign directors are elected and the board of directors is established. However, electing the "provisional" directors is not in accordance with Article 10 of the Land Regulations and is difficult for the Chinese authorities and the city's Chinese population to agree to.

New Directors Take Office According to Past Practice: The special meeting of foreign taxpayers will be held on April 17, before the start of the foreign taxpayers' annual meeting, which is the prelude to the annual meeting. The purpose of the special meeting is to approve the amendments to the "addendum" and the organization of the "provisional council" of the Land Regulations. The various proposals have been announced by the Municipal Council. It is expected that the meeting will start at 1:30 PM and will proceed smoothly, and can be completed within an hour, followed by the annual meeting. As for the new directors taking office, according to Article 21 of the Land Regulations, "The elected directors shall take office after the accounts of the outgoing directors have been audited and approved by the annual meeting as stipulated in Articles 9 and 12 of these regulations." Therefore, the sixteen "provisional" directors can officially take office from April 18, with a term of office "not less than one year," similar to "non-provisional" directors. As for amending the addendum to the Land Regulations, according to Article 11 of the Land Regulations, "The addenda established by the Board of Directors according to the powers granted in this chapter shall not be implemented until they have been approved by the consuls and ministers of the contracting countries, or a majority thereof, and passed by a special meeting of taxpayers." Therefore, amending the addendum without the approval of the contracting countries, and establishing the "provisional council" without the approval of the Chinese government, are both illegal acts.

### Severe Measures to Be Taken to Restrict Electricity Consumption; Experts Complete Investigation and Prepare Report; Considerations for Solutions Take All Parties into Account

At a weekly banquet held by the Rotary Club of Shanghai at the Metropole Hotel on the 10th, Ferris, Vice President of the Shanghai Power Company, said in his speech that the expert committee of the Municipal Council has completed its investigation on the restriction of electricity and has recently prepared a report, which has been submitted to the bureau. It is expected that the bureau will take action to continue restricting electricity consumption soon. Ferris went on to review the reasons for the current electricity shortage, and predicted that unless some of the possibilities that are currently under investigation are realized, more severe measures to restrict electricity use will need to be implemented soon.

Air Conditioning May Be Suspended This Summer: It is said that air conditioning is one of Shanghai's luxuries. To save electricity, the use of air conditioning may be suspended this summer. Some people believe that the power company may rotate the power supply to various districts of the city. In fact, this extreme measure cannot be implemented without the cooperation of various users, as it will affect factories and shops, hinder commercial contacts, and hinder public safety.

Industrial and Commercial Electricity Use Must Be Controlled: To achieve effective restrictions on electricity, it is only possible to control 3,500 industrial and commercial users, whose electricity consumption accounts for 92 percent of the total electricity consumption. The remaining 9,850 ordinary users only consume 7.2 percent of the electricity. Therefore, even if the electricity supply to residential areas is completely stopped, causing Shanghai to return to the dark ages, the result would be minimal savings in electricity. Neon lights, nightclubs, and other electricity consumption under the "entertainment" category account for only one percent of the total annual electricity consumption. However, although the general public's savings in electricity are small, they do not greatly affect the power plant's coal consumption, but they help prevent factories from reducing workers due to power shortages.

Fuel Supply Is Extremely Pessimistic: Ferris expressed pessimism about the continued transport of oil and coal to Shanghai. He said that everything that can be done to increase the fuel supply is being done. Although there has been some progress, the amount is very small and discouraging. As of April 1, the power company was short 36 percent, or 176,000 tons, of the 485,000 tons of coal it needed for the year.

Experts Consider Fair Solutions: Ferris also revealed the following points that the expert committee of the Municipal Council considered when formulating fair solutions for restricting electricity: Without restrictions on electricity, the fuel required is 50,000 tons of coal per month, an average of 8,000 tons of coal every four and a half days; Currently, only 25,000 tons of coal can be obtained per month, which is half of the required amount, so the maximum limit on electricity may also be half; When the issue of restrictions first arose, the power company had 150,000 tons of coal in storage, enough for only three months; It is estimated that when precise electricity allocation methods are implemented in place of the trial restriction methods, the coal in storage will be reduced to 100,000 tons (currently, there are 120,000 tons remaining). In addition, it is also necessary to consider not allowing factories to lay off large numbers of workers or drastically reduce their electricity consumption.

### U.S. Ambassador Gauss Will Pass Through Shanghai Next Month

The new U.S. Ambassador to China, Gauss, after bidding farewell to President Roosevelt, is scheduled to depart from San Francisco on April 25 aboard the President Garfield of the American President Lines and arrive in Shanghai. According to a report by a reporter from the Da Guang News Agency, the President Garfield is expected to arrive in Shanghai on May 14, at which time Ambassador Gauss will disembark on a passenger launch to meet old friends. The ship will stay in Shanghai overnight and depart for Hong Kong on the 15th, from which Gauss will fly to Chongqing to assume his new post.

### After Negotiations Between Shipping Companies and the Japanese, Two Foreign Ships Have Unloaded Cargo

A German ship belonging to the Xianghe Shipping Company and the Italian-owned Maberia have broken free from Japanese surveillance and successively entered the Wusongkou and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf at No. 16 Pier to unload their cargo yesterday and the day before. The Italian-owned Baoli, belonging to the Italian-owned Italian China Shipping Company, has not yet regained its freedom, but is expected to be resolved within one or two days. It is also known that the British-owned Da Cheng, which was once blocked from leaving the port, learned yesterday that negotiations had failed and decided to temporarily postpone its departure. It is also learned that the Swedish-owned Rui Tai, belonging to the Norwegian-owned Wah Lun Shipping Company, has now returned to Shanghai from Bogen, but has not yet entered the Wusongkou. It is still difficult to know whether it has also been subjected to the same Japanese surveillance. As for the five ships Moufu, Jiangsu, Anmanli, Changde, and Avimali, which were seized in the Zhoushan waters, there is still no news of their release.

### Japanese Troops Defend Shanghai-Hangzhou Train After Bombing

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that the Japanese authorities are currently investigating the bombing of a passenger train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway near Qiashi at 8:00 AM on Wednesday. According to Japanese sources, although the train was derailed and overturned due to the explosion, no one was injured and the damage was not serious, and traffic was restored at 11:00 AM on the same day. It is heard that the Japanese sent 130 railway guards to defend the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Nanjing lines on Thursday, presumably as a result of the bombing on Wednesday.

### All Victims in Avenue Haig Assassination Case Were Korean; Related to Morphine Trafficking Case

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that it has been confirmed that the two men who were shot in front of a restaurant near Avenue Haig and Rue Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession at 8:30 PM last night (the 10th) were both Korean, not Japanese. It is believed that the case is related to morphine trafficking. The police of the Japanese Consulate and the French Concession Police Department are jointly investigating the case but are not disclosing details, so it is not known who the victims are. The two Koreans were shot as soon as they left the restaurant last night. One died instantly, and the other died of his injuries shortly after being sent to Guangci Hospital.

### Investigation of the Aiko Case Concluded, Preliminary Hearing to Proceed Soon; Captain of the "Garonne" Has Received Instructions, Location and Charges Undisclosed

The "North-China Daily News" reports that Mr. Aiko, a French businessman and leader of the Free French movement in this area, was accused of plotting the escape of French soldiers, leading to his detention on the French gunboat "Garonne," currently docked in the Huangpu River. The preliminary investigation into this case by the French naval authorities in Shanghai has concluded. The captain of the "Garonne" received an order from Hanoi yesterday (the 10th), instructing him to proceed with the preliminary hearing immediately, and relayed this to Aiko's lawyer, Mr. Prime. It is reported that the French authorities will send a French naval officer to serve as magistrate to handle this case and determine whether it should be tried by a military tribunal. As of yesterday, Mr. Prime still had no idea what charges Aiko would face. According to Mr. Prime, he expects to receive a detailed report within a few days, revealing the specific charges. Yesterday, Mrs. Aiko was again permitted to board the ship to visit her husband. Mr. Prime will also meet with Aiko for the second time today (the 11th) to discuss defense matters. It is reported that the preliminary investigation was conducted by the judicial department of the French naval authorities. It remains unknown whether Aiko will be tried in Shanghai or transferred to Saigon.

Cour's Telegram of Condolences: Free French residents in this city have gained the sympathy and assistance of most people in the world. According to a broadcast by XMHA radio in this city, the Singapore Tagore Movement Headquarters has sent a telegram of condolences regarding Aiko's illegal arrest. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, has also sent a telegram of condolences to Mrs. Aiko.

### Dozens of Goods Subject to Informal Embargo

According to Jianghai Customs, in addition to machinery, the items that have been subject to informal embargoes include metal products such as copper, iron, lead, and zinc; liquid fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and kerosene; electrical materials such as electric wires, telephone wires, telegraph wires, storage batteries, and dry batteries; auto parts; and rubber products such as running shoes, totaling dozens of items.

### Detailed Account of Exchange of Fire Between Chinese Youths and Japanese Troops; Over One Hundred Shots Fired by Both Sides

According to the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," an exchange of fire occurred at 6:40 p.m. the day before yesterday at the corner of Boone Road and D'israeli Road in Hongkou between Japanese Marines and twenty-four Chinese youths. Over one hundred shots were fired by both sides. No one was injured, but four youths were arrested on the spot. It is reported that one of the detainees admitted to the Japanese authorities that they

are currently planning

to incite labor strikes in the Japanese "occupied areas." According to a Japanese official speaking to a reporter from the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," more "terrorists" are expected to be arrested in the coming days following the shootout. According to Japanese military authorities, Japanese army, navy, and "police" authorities have been jointly conducting a special operation in recent days to eliminate "terrorists." An investigation revealed that a large number of "terrorists" were hiding in the D'israeli Road area, prompting the mobilization of a large number of Marines to encircle the area. It is said that the "terrorists" hiding there were mostly disguised as fruit or vegetable vendors. Upon seeing the Japanese soldiers surrounding the area, they preemptively launched a fierce attack, resulting in the arrest of four people on the spot, while the other twenty escaped. It is said that the shooting

was quite intense.

The Japanese troops fired very little in return. Seized by the Japanese military were two Mausers, two pistols, and two butcher knives. According to the Japanese side, the four arrested were all members of the Chinese Revolutionary Youth League, formerly the Three Principles of the People Youth League. According to Japanese sources, one of those arrested admitted to the Japanese military that they entered Hongkou wearing Western suits, then changed into coolie attire to disguise themselves as peddlers. The youth told the Japanese authorities that there are quite a few of them in the Hongkou area. The Japanese are now taking various precautionary measures, and any Chinese person suspected of terrorism will be arrested by the Japanese authorities in the coming days.

### Public Works Department Financial Shortfall

To make up for this shortfall, the Treasurer of the Public Works Department only has two options: selling Public Works Department property and issuing public bonds.

### Purpose of Silver Deposits in Tianjin Banks Clarified

Purpose of Silver Deposits in Tianjin Banks Clarified: The 100,000 pounds of silver belonging to the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank in Tianjin were transferred to the Yokohama Specie Bank after the Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese side attempted to take it over. This matter was negotiated between the British and Japanese sides for quite some time, and was eventually confiscated by the Japanese side. At the time, the Japanese side promised to use the silver to provide relief to refugees in North China, etc. According to sources in the shipping industry, the silver has indeed been used to purchase 8,000 tons of Australian flour. It is reported that the first batch of flour has already arrived in Tianjin, transported by chartered Japanese ships. It is said that the Japanese ships have continued to travel to Australia for further shipments.

### Fake Currency Operation Cracked on North Henan Road; Printing Press and Copper Plates Seized; About 10,000 Yuan Worth of Banknotes Printed

Huishi Police Detective Shang Wu and Detective Zhao Ziduo learned that someone was secretly organizing a fake currency operation in the stove rooms at numbers 416 and 418 North Henan Road. They then went with Western Detective O'Neill and Chinese Detectives Feng Qi and Deng Shu to arrest the suspects. At the time, they arrested seven locals who were working on the operation: Zhou Xihua, Yao Yunqi, Sun Shunyun from Southern China, Li Zhijing and Feng Shudi from Shaoxing, Mrs. Yonggui Li, and Mrs. Zhao Shao. They seized approximately 100,000 yuan worth of unprinted five-yuan fake banknotes from the Bank of Communications, as well as various copper plates and a printing press used for making the banknotes. The paper and printing of the fake banknotes were extremely exquisite, almost indistinguishable from the real thing, and even had watermarks and red and green lines. Unless one was an expert, it would be difficult to immediately determine that they were fake. The cracking of this fake currency operation will save many poor people from suffering losses. The police are still conducting a thorough investigation to apprehend all the criminals involved.

### Persuading Fellow Blacklisted Compatriots to Quit Drug Addiction

Since the promulgation and implementation of the ordinances banning smoking and drugs, the severity of the penalties is far greater than in cases of robbery. Yesterday, there was a case in the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, and the warning issued by the presiding judge Chuan Lin to the defendants is worth noting. Judge Chuan's pronouncement stated that the harm of opium is already known to everyone. It damages one's health, eliminates one's ambition, and also violates the law. However, people do not take heed, willingly embark on the wrong path, and do not think of pulling themselves out. There is no excuse for this in terms of reason or morality. Now, those who commit new offenses under the new laws may be sentenced to death. Moreover, at this time of high prices, with the price of rice exceeding silver per stone, it is already difficult to make ends meet, yet some people still have surplus funds to smoke opium. Some people would rather have no rice to cook at home, but opium is indispensable. From any perspective, they should be severely punished and there is no room for leniency, etc. Judge Chuan's pronouncement is a wake-up call for those addicted to drugs. It is recorded here to persuade those blacklisted individuals to quit as soon as possible to avoid the risk of death.

### Song Bingzheng Promoted to Detective

Song Bingzheng, the Chinese Deputy Detective of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Public Works Department Police Department, has been promoted to Detective because of his excellent performance and competence, which has been highly praised by his superiors.

The three arrested suspects were sent to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday.

### Man Opens Room in Inn, Leaves Behind Bizarre Cloth Bag

A Genital Organ Found Inside the Bag; The Guest Disappeared After Bringing It In

Yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 p.m., a man went to the Jinmen Hotel at No. 104 Jing'an Temple Road in the Public Concession and opened room 202.

### Robbery and Homicide Case Involving Bamboo Poles

Two Perpetrators Each Sentenced to Seven Years of Penal Servitude

Shen Yougui and Yang A'pan, two men from Jiangbei who worked as boatmen, argued with their fellow boatman Wang Youmei on their boats in the Suzhou Creek in Fujian Road on the 27th of last month over a bamboo pole that had been lost from a cotton boat drifting downstream. One of the two, Shen or Yang, jumped onto Wang's small boat and punched Wang's waist and chest, causing injuries to vital areas, resulting in his death on the spot. Wang's brother then reported the incident to the Chinese police, who detained Shen and Yang and charged them with causing death through assault in the First Special District Court.

### Is Shanghai a Good Place to Live? Western Young Men's Society Debates the Topic; Concludes that Shanghai is Not a Good Place

According to the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," the Western Young Men's Society of this city held a debate yesterday (the 10th) at 9 p.m. The topic was "Is Shanghai a Good Place for Us to Live?" The affirmative side was the American Church Debate Team, and the negative side was the Western Young Men's Society Debate Group. Hardy began by presenting his affirmative arguments, but Hardy's arguments were mostly commonplace and uninspiring. Then, Dr. Tan, arguing for the negative side, stated that Shanghai is not a good place to live, and listed various reasons to support his claim, such as the overcrowding of residents, the overcrowding of hotels, restaurants, and elevators, and even the beggar shelters. He also mentioned the habit of Shanghai residents spitting everywhere, which causes various diseases and increases the mortality rate. Unhygienic food and the lack of educational sports and vacation travel facilities are common for both Chinese and Westerners. There are too few schools, and teachers' salaries are too low. Crime and vice are rampant, and the police force is insufficient to deal with this threat. All of this makes Shanghai a bad place to live, forcing local residents to resort to drinking and gambling as forms of entertainment. Afterwards, those participating in the debate on both sides expressed their respective opinions. Then, Jones, Minsd, and Savis, the three judges, deliberated and immediately announced that the debaters on the negative side had won.

### Labor Strikes in Various Industries Nearing Resolution, but Still with Complications

Underwear Factory Labor Strike Resolved Satisfactorily; Serious Attitude of Businessmen

The workers of dozens of underwear factories, including Xinguang, Yongxin, Daguangming, Dahua, Dakang, and Anle, demanded improved treatment from management due to the rising cost of living. After several rounds of negotiations with management, representatives of the management, Chuan Liangzheng, and representatives of the labor force, Sheng Xiong Cai, Li Jinsheng, Xuan Yuanlong, and Wang Qingfa, reached a satisfactory resolution through coordination talks on the afternoon of April 10. Wage increase measures: (1) Ironing fee: 4.20 yuan per dozen; (2) Cleaning fee: 3.84 yuan per dozen; (3) Meal allowance: 22.50 yuan (one porridge and two meals). The new wage will be implemented from April 1. All underwear factories will resume work immediately.

Datong Dye Factory

Workers at the Datong Weaving and Dyeing Factory at No. 372 Da Xi Road demanded a wage increase due to soaring rice prices, but the factory failed to adopt it and fired workers. Yesterday afternoon, all workers automatically stopped working.

Businessmen

The Business Press Association has repeatedly sent letters and telegrams to Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general manager in Hong Kong, requesting an appropriate increase in living allowances for the staff due to soaring prices. The personnel director of the company went to Hong Kong to negotiate, but there was no progress. The members of the association convened a general meeting of all members in the store at 5:30 p.m. yesterday, half an hour before closing time, with hundreds of people in attendance. The public sentiment was quite indignant. After unanimous deliberation, it was decided to send another telegram to Hong Kong demanding that General Manager Wang Yunwu give a reply within five days, otherwise they would take decisive action. Therefore, the labor-management dispute at the company is quite serious.

Cinema Employees

Cinema employees in this city submitted a request to the management on the 8th of this month, demanding a 150% salary increase and 40% of the annual surplus as employee bonuses. This has been reported previously. According to a Da Tong News Agency reporter, the management has responded. The foreign-owned major cinemas have agreed to increase salaries as requested, and the domestic cinemas have also accepted the consideration and are willing to increase them appropriately. However, the management is unwilling to consider the bonus increase.

Shoemaking Workers

There are more than 500 shoemaking businesses in this city. Shoemaking workers, due to high prices and insufficient income to cover expenses, demanded a 30% wage increase from management but failed to do so. They went on strike last month, which has lasted for two sentences (two months). According to a reporter from Da Tong News Agency, some leather shoe store owners are willing to increase wages by 30%, so they have resumed work one after another. However, some are still deadlocked. It is reported that the workers who have resumed work will use the 30% increase in income to subsidize those who have not resumed work, causing dissatisfaction from the management, and the labor strike has been causing more conflicts.

### Easter Prayer Ceremony

### Sacred Obstetric Knowledge: A Cruel Story of Difficult Labor

— Wei

(Continued from yesterday) Below is a cruel story of difficult labor.

A middle-aged couple, blessed with a child after ten years. The husband suffered from heart failure, which undoubtedly hindered childbirth. But they were so eager to have a son. To their surprise, his wife became pregnant. She carefully and cautiously went to the hospital for checkups, and took a lot of tonics, so his wife grew very strong, and the fetus in her womb undoubtedly developed especially well. When the time came for delivery, she went to the hospital specifically. After a few days, the pregnant woman was carried into the delivery room. Her husband waited anxiously outside the door of the delivery room, his blood filled with new hope. His wish to have a son was right in front of him. The universe would soon bestow on him a plump baby. The obstetrician personally took on the arduous task of delivering the baby for his wife. The doctor found that the fetus was too large and needed surgery. The pregnant woman was given a sedative and lost consciousness. The doctor grabbed the sides of the fetus's head with forceps and pulled the fetus out, but the doctor was eager to pull the fetus down before the mother woke up. The forceps were not effective, and they slipped off with a pull. He put the forceps on again, and they slipped off again. Once again, he tried five or six times, but he didn't hook the fetus firmly, and the fetus was never pulled down. So she became impatient, because the time for the sedative was about to pass, and there could be no further delay, so she used the final method of surgery. She didn't know what tool she used, but she chiseled open the fetus's head, and blood and brain matter flowed out. The fetus shrank and was quickly thrown into the lead bucket filled with waste. It was such a strong male fetus! His limbs were still trembling and twitching, and his heart was so healthy, but when he was born, he didn't know there was such a world, nor did he know that his little life was so precious to people, and even less did he know that his "father" had fainted outside the door of the delivery room. His "mother" was enduring the pain of life and death for him? His little life was lost at the hands of the executioner!

Really, a woman should understand pregnancy and postpartum hygiene, as well as how to care for infants, etc. These are very important knowledge. She herself can avoid unexpected dangers during childbirth. Obstetricians should bear the responsibility of safety and high morality. Skilled midwifery can turn difficult labor into safety, and mediocre midwifery can turn smooth labor into danger. This work is sacred and must not be done rashly or use tools recklessly to save oneself effort.

Education News

### The Current State of Education in Anhui: Anhui Political Academy to Begin Admissions in the Autumn

Since the start of the war, Anhui's education has gone through three stages. From the "July 7th" Incident to 1938, schools at all levels in Anhui suffered devastation and were mostly suspended. In 1939, the Education Department, facing extreme difficulties in terms of manpower and resources, undertook the registration of unemployed and out-of-school students and the restoration of schools at all levels. In 1940, while readjusting and enriching the restored and established schools at all levels, it also sought to expand the function of school education, urging schools at all levels to concurrently run social education programs. In addition, it actively prepared to establish a university or college above the specialized level.

After more than three years of war, the actual situation of education in Anhui Province can be understood. The details are listed separately as follows:

A. Elementary Education

(1) Establishment of Temporary Elementary Schools: Anhui Province originally had thirty-three elementary schools, all of which were suspended one after another due to the impact of the war. Starting in 1939, the Education Department established twenty-eight temporary elementary schools. In 1940, ten more schools were added, making a total of thirty-eight provincial temporary elementary schools with 241 classes, 390 faculty and staff, and 10,665 students.

(2) Restoration of Regular and Short-Term Elementary Schools and Establishment of Township and Village Elementary Schools: Anhui Province originally had 3,793 county, district, and private elementary schools and 3,800 short-term elementary schools. In 1938, when the Japanese army invaded the Jianghuai region, many were destroyed. In the spring of 1939, the Education Department urgently sought to restore them, resuming classes in 2,038 regular elementary schools and 1,517 short-term elementary schools. In April of the same year, based on the principle of unified politics, education, and health in Anhui Province, all existing regular and short-term elementary schools were changed to township and village elementary schools. According to statistics reported by various counties, by the end of 1939, there were 131 township elementary schools and 2,865 village elementary schools in the province, totaling 4,067 schools with 5,843 classes, 8,910 faculty and staff, and 172,000 students, with expenses of 851,652 yuan. In 1940, the Education Department continued to order various counties to continue preparations according to the original plan. According to statistics, the counties in Anhui Province had established 1,522 township elementary schools and 4,170 village elementary schools in the first semester of 1940, an increase of 311 township elementary schools and 1,315 village elementary schools compared to 1939. Currently, the province has a total of 2,723 township elementary schools and 7,035 village elementary schools.

(3) Implementation of Education and Care for Refugee Children: Anhui Province is located in the rear of the Japanese army. After the disaster, refugee children were displaced. In the spring of 1939, the Education Department ordered all temporary elementary schools to do their best to take in refugee children, providing them with books, uniforms, lodging, and other expenses. However, due to limited funds, relief was not fully provided. In 1940, the Central Relief Committee allocated 10,000 yuan per month to the Education Department for the education and care of refugee children. Therefore, the Education Department universally stipulated the number of refugees to be accommodated in all temporary elementary schools in the province. 1. Twenty-six temporary elementary schools in Jiangbei, except for the Lihuang Temporary Elementary School, which accommodated 150 students, each school accommodated 30 students. 2. Twelve temporary elementary schools in southern Anhui, each school accommodated 20 students. In total, thirty-eight temporary elementary schools in the province can educate and care for 1,140 children.

(4) Printing of Elementary School Textbooks: After the outbreak of the war, transportation in various places was obstructed. Anhui Province's school textbooks could not be purchased. The Education Department, aware of this, printed mimeographed samples at the beginning of the first semester of 1939 and sent them to various counties for reproduction. By 1940, the textbooks needed for elementary schools at all levels were completely printed by the Education Department and distributed to various counties for instruction, ensuring that all schools were fully equipped before the start of the school year.

(5) Training of Elementary School Teachers: The training of elementary school teachers in Anhui Province was originally conducted in the elementary school teacher training group attached to the "Anhui Provincial Political and Military Cadre Training Class" in the first semester of 1939, selecting qualified personnel for centralized training. However, only one session was held before it was suspended for some reason. Subsequently, in the second semester of the same year, the Education Department formulated the "Measures for Counties to Conduct Short-Term Training for Township and Village Elementary School Teachers" and ordered various counties to conduct training separately.

### How to Study Chinese (Part 2)

— Xue Wu Jing

IV. Scope

Although I have previously defined Chinese language, it is still too general and does not clearly define its scope. I have also said that Chinese language is not Chinese studies, and Chinese language is not literature. However, this is not a complete separation; there is still some relationship. Now, I might as well go a step further and describe its scope as follows:

(1) Prose: Regardless of ancient or modern styles, regardless of classical or vernacular language, as long as it follows natural language, with sentences that are long and short, sparse and dense, and does not imitate the tone of parallel prose, whether narrating events, expressing emotions, or reasoning, and is able to move people's hearts, it is timeless and immortal prose.

(2) Poetry: Some poems have fixed structures, fixed numbers of characters per line, and fixed tones for characters. Following certain patterns and rhythms, either complementing reality with imagination or using balanced couplets, they can be sung aloud or set to music. Moreover, with both literary merit and emotional depth, the poems, lyrics, and ballads that are endlessly enjoyable can all be brought together into this category.

(3) Fiction: "Of the nine hundred types of stories, it originates from the common people." Its early origins have long been established. When it comes to scope, there are tales of the strange and legendary stories. When it comes to nature, there are social and romance stories. When it comes to style, there are chaptered novels and short stories. Examining their tone, there are satire and allegory. The heroic anecdotes, the romantic love affairs, the strange encounters with ghosts and foxes, and the wonders of wood and stone truly cause everyone to lower their heads and each to be captivated. Who doesn't love fiction? And who doesn't learn the fun of life and broad knowledge from novels?

(4) Drama: Han Fu, Tang Poetry, Song Lyrics, Yuan Opera, and Ming and Qing Novels truly represent a unique style of writing for each era. The Romance of the Western Chamber, Pipa, Palace of Eternal Life, and Swallow's Letter, with their true depiction of emotions, wonderful expression of scenery, and elegant use of words, can be called unparalleled in the world. Each reached its peak. However, with the rise of Peking Opera, the Xipi and Erhuang styles became too shallow and could not be considered refined. However, after the influence of European and American styles, there was a surge of excellent creations in one-act and three-act plays, representing a new wave of talent.

(5) Practical Writing: This scope is even broader. Petitions, telegrams, letters, declarations, advertisements, leaflets, thank-you notes, couplets, and notes are all practical writings essential to life. Among them, there are many carefully structured short pieces that are worthy of appreciation. Often, those who can write thousands of words may lack knowledge of structure, rhythm, and tone, resulting in thoughtless writing and becoming a laughingstock. This is all due to a lack of daily experience and too little practice, resulting in carelessness. When the time comes to use it, they will be at a loss and feel constrained.

(6) Newspapers and Magazines: Newspapers are the mouthpiece of mankind and our spiritual food. "Scholars can know the affairs of the world without stepping out of their doors." Those who read the newspaper without interruption every day have a clear understanding of world affairs and know domestic affairs like the back of their hand. Moreover, they contain editorials, telegrams, correspondence, novels, travelogues, literary works, and various other works that are closely related to modern writing. By reading them, we not only increase our knowledge and expand our horizons, but also practice reasoning and develop the ability to judge. And how can we not also include magazines, which are more systematic monographs? (To be continued)

### Doctor Saves Robber

— Guo Hongdi

In America, there was a ruthless robber named Higgins. Once, during a robbery gone wrong, he was surrounded by the police and shot. Bleeding profusely and in critical condition, he was sent to the hospital. The doctor said he needed a blood transfusion, but they searched everywhere for Type III blood and could not find it. At this time, Dr. Perry in the hospital suddenly remembered that he also had Type III blood, so he voluntarily donated blood to the robber.

A policeman was surprised and said to Dr. Perry, "I really don't understand. This guy will either be sentenced to a long prison term or be executed in the electric chair. And you still want to give him a blood transfusion."

Dr. Perry said, "It is our responsibility to save his life. The rest is up to you and the court to handle."

The greatest people in the world are those who fulfill their responsibilities, the most lovable are those who fulfill their responsibilities, and the happiest are those who consciously recognize their responsibilities and do them without hesitation. Higgins may be a ruthless killer, and his life may do more harm than good to society. But for a doctor, his duty is to save lives, regardless of whether they are bad or good, poor or rich. When a person is on the verge of life and death, the value of life is higher than everything else. Preserving life may give them a chance to abandon evil and return to righteousness, but losing life means everything is over.

Dr. Perry may remain unknown throughout his life, but a better world is created by people who fulfill their responsibilities.

### The Test of Genius

— Lini

The existence of genius has always been a subject of debate among scientists. Both sides naturally have sufficient reasons and evidence. Before conducting further research, we cannot hastily draw the most accurate conclusion. But in our opinion, genius must exist. Although post-natal education and training can indeed change a person, truly great intelligence and talent are mostly innate.

Most notably, in music and painting, genius is almost the most important condition. Many musicians and calligraphers, due to their superior genius, are already far beyond the reach of ordinary people as children! In addition, heroes and great men, all creators of human endeavors, are also endowed with special talents. This can be seen from the characteristics and talents of heroes and great men in their early years.

Many scientists in the United States have recently devoted themselves to testing the intelligence of geniuses, thinking about further researching ways to improve education. Stanford University can be considered the center of this research. They subjected 301 historically famous geniuses to intelligence testing. These geniuses, such as John Milton (poet), Napoleon, and Byron, were all born between 1450 and 1850. The project was led by Dr. Catharine Cox and two assistants. The method of testing was to use scores to rank the characteristics and talents of each person in their early years, as recorded in history. As a result, among these 301 people, the highest score was obtained by J.S. Mill, with 190 points, which is 90 points higher than the average intelligence of ordinary people. Mill wrote a history of Rome at the age of six and became a Latin teacher at the age of eight. It is undoubtedly the top spot. Secondly, the German poet Goethe, the Dutch jurist and creator of international law Hugo Grotius, and the German mathematician and philosopher Leibniz each obtained 185 points. Napoleon and the Prussian composer Beethoven each obtained 135 points. Byron obtained 150 points, the Italian calligrapher Michael Angelo obtained 145 points, Lincoln obtained 125 points, the talented French woman Mme do Stael obtained 155 points, the second president of the United States Adams obtained 165 points, the British writer and poet Coleridge obtained 175 points, Washington obtained 125 points, and Raphael obtained 110 points.

The above test results have one shortcoming, which is that those whose early lives are described more in history also scored higher. But one thing is worth noting: according to Dr. Cox, outstanding men and women often show their talents in their early years. Those whose intelligence score is above 150 in their early years can probably create a career after adulthood.

However, genius is not entirely reliable. The degree of one's own efforts is the main factor determining one's future. People without genius may not achieve nothing if they work hard. Regarding this, Dr. Cox also said that even if one's intelligence is scored at 200 points in childhood, it is still useless if they are complacent about their genius and lazy in practical work, because success does not entirely rely on genius!

(6) Product of love

"I don't understand what you mean, why don't you go ask your young mistress!" Qiu Haitang really couldn't bear to play this charade with her anymore. He sped up his pace and crossed the courtyard in a few steps, leaving the little maid behind him.

Fortunately, the second section of the Luo family's house was divided into front and back halves, with a row of eight-panel screens separating them. After going around the screen, there was a small hall and two side rooms. Qiu Haitang's left foot had just stepped into the front hall, and before he could turn his body out of the back of the hall, he blurted out:

"What do you want her to tell me? Her gestures I..."

Halfway through his words, he noticed that there was another slim man in a gray cloth gown standing with Xiangqi on the stone steps outside the hall, and his face was facing inside. At a glance, he knew it was someone familiar, so he hurriedly swallowed the rest of his words and retreated behind the screen in a panic. Although he felt that his movements had been very quick, and there was also half a screen to cover him, it seemed unlikely that the person outside the hall would notice him, but the two sentences just now were really too loud, how could that person not pay attention?

He stood dazedly behind the screen in the back room, holding a violently beating heart, as if his back had been severely stabbed by a pair of sharp triangular eyes.

The mute maid saw that he was still back again, and felt very happy. She thought he had understood her meaning, so she smiled at him slightly, and strode out of the front hall alone. But she retreated back in less than two or three minutes, with an unusually annoyed look on her face. This time, she no longer gestured with Qiu Haitang. She grabbed his sleeve and led him straight into Xiangqi's bedroom like he was blind.

"Ji Zhaoxiong is Lao Yuan's orderly, so he will definitely come here, but unfortunately I didn't think of that! I don't know if he saw me?" Qiu Haitang paced back and forth in the room, constantly thinking.

He first blamed the mute for not being able to speak, but then he thought that he was also a bit too reckless. Although the place was hidden very cleverly, it was also really dangerous. If he ran into someone from Yuan's family, there would be no way to explain it.

"What if Ji Zhaoxiong has recognized me and immediately asks Xiangqi, how will she answer?" He worried that Xiangqi had already been humiliated by Ji Zhaoxiong outside. (79)

### The Face of the Registration Clerk

— Jin Tong

The wound on my foot has gradually shrunk and the pain has disappeared. I really have to thank that doctor, especially since I no longer have to see the face of that registration clerk, I feel more comfortable in my heart.

It is said that there is a "fate" for everything. My foot and the face of that registration clerk must have a fate; and this fate is a "karmic debt".

The first time I went to register, I met the acting clerk, but when I walked into this clinic, I heard "No one hundred yuan, no registration!" Following the voice, I saw a fierce face with murderous intent opposite a pitiful face, which really startled me. So I kept a vigilant heart and dared not be hospitalized.

The second time I still went to the south window where I registered last time. There were already many people waiting there. This time I saw that "fierce face." Driven by "vigilance," I murmured, "Sir! Can I register?" "Two more minutes!" Only the lips were moving, and the rest of the face had no wrinkles at all. Although standing is tiring and painful, it will only be two minutes, so let's bear it!

Two minutes had passed. The registration clerk, who was originally idle, began to sharpen pencils, find the registration book, and change the date stamp. He was busy for nearly ten minutes and opened the east window: "Register here!" With a painful and unbearable foot, I followed the group of "fellow sufferers," passed through a dark corridor, and walked to another window to complete the registration.

To take care of my painful foot, I went a little later the third time. The clinic time was 8:00 AM, and when I got there, it was already 8:15, but the registration clerk's position was still empty. I very cleverly went to the east window to wait. When the long hand pointed to six o'clock, the registration clerk came, sharpened pencils as usual... After waiting, he sat in the south position. I couldn't help but knock on the window and ask, "Sir! Are you registering?" "Register here!" Oh my god! I have to run to the south window!

If I come a little earlier, I have to wait twelve minutes; if I come a little later, I have to wait another fifteen minutes. Each time I have to walk through a dark corridor, the registration clerk's face is always so stern that there is not a trace of blood, but my foot is so painful that pus and blood are dripping.

If there were no smiling faces of the doctors to ease the pain, I really would not want to endure this mental stimulation to alleviate the local pain.

The doctor can heal my foot, and I hope the doctor can transform the face of that registration clerk, so that it will not be a stain on the great hospital. (Moved to help with winter clothing)

Women

### I Am a Parasite

— Li Wen

My happiness is built on money.

Needless to say, from the moment I was born until now, from being a girl to being a wife, material enjoyment has created my delicate and pampered physique. When my husband and I first got married, his assets were far less than one-tenth of my parents' wealth. Today, the longer the war lasts, the more savings he accumulates, almost surpassing his father-in-law. Is it speculation? Is it hoarding? Is it legitimate trade? I know nothing about it.

Commodity prices race against Father Time. Amidst the cries of suffering, I know that ordinary people are panicking because rice is costing over 120 yuan per dan (a traditional Chinese unit of dry measure), and coal briquettes cost 12 yuan per dan. My family, however, moved from a poor area to a Western-style house in the French Concession, where we paid twenty years' rent in advance. We switched from gas to electric stoves. Last year, when white rice cost 70 yuan, twenty bags were delivered. Including the driver and maid, there are five people in the family. He and the driver don't eat at home, so for half a year now, seventeen bags have remained untouched. The maid even smuggles some out. I am too far removed from this panic.

Without children, and still only eleven years old in my own mind, I am locked up in six or seven rooms, like a "criminal" serving a life sentence. All entertainment is only occasionally pleasant; the work itself is tedious. I feel sad about being a meaningless parasite, losing the true responsibility of a person. He is so busy all day that he forgets himself, seeking both fame and fortune. He gives me 6,000 yuan every month, and he pays for all expenses, but I mostly leave it in the trunk. I have my own private savings from my father, and I will inherit half of his estate in the future. What do I lack?

I am often unhappy. It is spring, and the little bees in the garden are buzzing around. The pale yellow sunlight shines on the green carpet. I am lying alone on the sofa, books and newspapers scattered all around. He hasn't come home for three nights. Money makes him lose his reason, and it also turns me into a "worm" of society. Every day is so boring, and I feel that the days are too long. I like to fantasize: "Those who worry about not having a place to play are decadent, while those who worry about not having food to eat have the light of struggle."

I sense my own darkness.

### Long Live Women

— Huang Xinde

Rather than saying that "Long Live Women" simply depicts the unfortunate experiences of a female office worker, it would be more appropriate to say that it is a film against feudalism. The protagonist of the film, Katie Furell (Joan Bennett), struggles so hard under the forces of feudalism and finally breaks free from its cage. The story is profoundly stimulating and delicately moving, and it deserves to be a popular novel. Joan Bennett's superb acting definitely deserves the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Both the writer and director, Sam Wood, have superb artistic skills. The entire story is narrated using many flashbacks. Katie is a small family woman with dreams. She works in a magazine and falls in love with the young and beautiful editor, Dennis Morgan. Although they get married, Morgan's family is a prominent family in Philadelphia, and his parents disapprove of Katie because she is not familiar with etiquette. Katie has to return to New York alone. Later, she falls in love with a doctor. When she agrees to marry the doctor, her old lover Morgan comes back. Although he has remarried, he is willing to go to South America with Katie. Katie reconsiders and recalls the past, which is the beginning of the story. She finally politely refuses Morgan and marries the doctor, which is the ending of the film.

The characteristic of this story is that it is tortuous, delicate and stimulating. Each time Katie recalls her past, it is almost like a wonderful and moving short story. The beauty lies in the fact that these passages echo each other and can be connected in one breath. Every climax will make the audience feel deeply moved and unable to control themselves. For example, when Katie first drinks with Morgan in a restaurant, Morgan draws a "K" on the wine bottle. At first, it seems like just a casual stroke, but the second time Katie goes to this restaurant to wait for Morgan, the waiter still brings out the wine bottle with the drawing. She waits for Morgan for a long time, but she sees the news of Morgan's remarriage in the newspaper. At this time, Katie feels a great sense of loss. Another example is when Katie returns the ring that Morgan gave her to Morgan's son by another woman, saying it is a birthday gift for him, without revealing her own name. This will make the audience shed tears. The stimulation of the story has reached its peak, and Joan Bennett's inner performance is even more perfect. She conveys the inner pain of a woman who has been frustrated in love, and her acting is so profound and delicate that, besides Bette Davis, no one else can be compared to her. Dennis Morgan also has excellent achievements. After this film, he will undoubtedly gain unprecedented fame. The other supporting actors are also equally matched, making "Long Live Women" the most outstanding masterpiece of 1940.

### Random Thoughts on the Opera World - A Record of Fault-Finding

— Wang Kui

In "Yellow Crane Tower," Zhuge Liang already has a black three-section beard, but at that time, General Zhao Zilong still had a bare chin. In "Empty City Stratagem," Zhao Zilong's beard is already white, but Zhuge Liang instead has a light three-section beard.

When Huang Tianba, disguised as a Bao Ding, visits Bao Erdun in "Linked Rings," he falsely says that he encountered a good horse at the Malan Pass, saying that the horse has "...horns on its head, scales on its ribs, and two red glows on either side..." This is clearly a Qilin painted in the hall in earlier times, how could it resemble a horse!

When Lü Boshe in "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao" sees Cao Cao and the magistrate of Zhongmou County arriving at his village, he orders his family to kill a pig and personally takes a small wine pot to the neighborhood to buy wine. It is too extravagant to kill a pig for two guests; however, it is not extravagant to use a small wine pot to buy fine wine for three people to drink. Cao Cao only hears the cook saying "tie it up and kill it," but he does not hear the pig squealing when it is being slaughtered. If Cao Cao and Chen Gong could have heard the pig squealing, not only would Lü Boshe still be alive, but the Lü family's servants would not have died by the sword.

Tian Lun, one of the "Four Jinshi," asked Gu Nianshi for help. The scribe was drunk, and the letter was stolen by Song Wei and copied onto the lapel of his robe. Later, in the court of the Investigating Censor, the lapel was used as evidence of bribery by Tian Lun against Gu. It was not the original handwriting, there was no receipt for the bribe, and the plaintiff's handwritten letter was used as evidence of crime. Moreover, the plaintiff was accusing two high officials, and the Investigating Censor presiding over the case was an old friend of the two defendants. If Tian Lun were to deny everything and counter-sue Song Shijie for fabricating evidence to falsely accuse high officials, even a wise official like Mao Peng would not be able to defend Song Shijie.

Chapter Six: Temporarily Drunk Beside a Beautiful Woman's Zither

After he was pushed out of the room by the two bandits, another bandit stepped forward, each holding a bright ghost-head knife, and escorted Li Xin out together. When they arrived at the gate of the stronghold, there was an open space. The two bandits took Li Xin to a large tree and ordered him to kneel down. Li Xin said loudly, "I would rather die than kneel! Why should I kneel to you bandits?" One of the bandits said, "Li, you are still stubborn when you are about to die?" He pushed him hard, and Li Xin fell to the ground. One of the bandits grabbed his headscarf, and the other two bandits raised their ghost-head knives, about to strike him fiercely, when suddenly they heard someone shouting loudly from behind, "Quickly put down your knives, do not harm Young Master Li!" Everyone looked back and saw that it was a brother from the stronghold, so they asked, "We are acting on the order of the leader to execute Li, why are you saying not to harm him?" That person said, "I am also acting on the order of the leader, coming to tell you not to kill him." The previous bandits all clamored, "How strange! Just now the leader ordered us to kill this person, but now he says not to kill him, what is the reason?" That person laughed, "I don't know about that, you can ask the leader yourselves." The previous four bandits had no choice but to reluctantly escort Li Xin back into the stronghold. Li Xin was also inexplicably surprised. When they walked to the hall, they saw Tong Tianbao with a smile on his face, descending the steps to greet him. He said to Li Xin, "Young Master Li, you are truly a good man who cannot be subdued by power! I was just testing you. How could I intentionally kill you? You were not afraid at all, and you regarded death as returning home, which makes me admire you even more. Young Master, please forgive my rudeness." Li Xin laughed, "I am a prisoner, and the power of life and death is in your hands, why bother with this? Just kill me." Tong Tianbao said, "Young Master is too serious. I will talk to you in detail later." He then ordered a bandit to send Li Xin back to the exquisite room and serve him well, and not to offend the Young Master. Li Xin was about to say something more, but he was pushed by the two bandits and returned to that room. Li Xin said to himself, "Tong Tianbao is suddenly arrogant and then respectful, what does he mean by this? It is suspicious, but my mind is made up. At most, I will die, so let them do whatever they want." So he sat in the room to rest, but he could not help but think of his hometown. (36)

### A Life of Struggle

— Zong Yu

Strive hard from your own position, and always think from a broad perspective, so that your struggle maintains coordination with the entire society. If you do not pay attention to this, so that your struggle is disconnected from the struggle of the entire society, then you are not respecting the greater self.
