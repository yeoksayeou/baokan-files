Finance Minister Kung Hsiang-hsi and representatives from other ministries also came to the airport to see them off. A reporter from the United Press asked Dr. Currie whether he would visit Shanghai before returning to the United States. The doctor replied, "There is not enough time. We will return directly to our country." Before his departure, Dr. Currie gave the press a written statement, saying that he would not make any further statements until he had met with President Roosevelt. Dr. Currie and others were carrying more than ten wooden boxes, all of which contained gifts for President Roosevelt and U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also handed Currie a scroll of calligraphy written in his own hand to be delivered to President Roosevelt. What was written on it is unknown. When Dr. Kung Hsiang-hsi arrived at the airport, the plane had already started to move, but an Italian soldier waved a red flag to make it return to its original position. Dr. Currie and Mr. TeSpree also got off the plane again to shake hands with Dr. Kung Hsiang-hsi. Dr. Kung told them that he had deliberately arrived late so that they would stay a little longer. Three minutes later, when the plane was about to take off again, U.S. Ambassador Johnson also arrived at the Yangtze River bank. Ambassador Johnson did not call for the plane to stop again; he merely stood on the bank of the river and watched the plane take off. According to an employee of China National Aviation Corporation, it was the first time in Chongqing that a plane had repeatedly stopped after starting. Dr. Currie looked very happy at the airport, shaking hands and chatting with everyone. Currie was wearing a black suit and a grey coat, without a hat, and a navy blue scarf with white dots.

### Japanese Army Establishes Naval Supply Station in Dapeng Bay; Also Building an Airfield on Land; Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Achieves Another Victory

Guilin The Japanese are recently developing Dapeng Bay as a naval supply station and building an airfield on land with an area of more than 200 mu, which is about to be completed. (27th Dispatch)

Chongqing A Chinese military spokesman recently stated that there have been sporadic contacts on various battlefields this week, but the scale is not large, and there have been no significant advances or retreats on either side. Only the Chinese army on the Pinghan Railway has successively recovered Queshan, Paomaling, and other places. As for the Japanese army's preparations for advancing south in South China, they are progressing quite actively. Naval and army supply stations have been established in the Dapeng Bay area, and fortifications are being built along the coast of Hainan Island. A large number of Japanese warships are also concentrated in Yulin Port. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)

Chongqing Military News: (1) More than 2,000 Japanese troops from Heilongguan, Chaidianzhen, Liucun, and other places in southwestern Shanxi Province advanced towards Tianjiagou (southwest of Heilongguan) and Yukou (northwest of Xiangling) in several directions on the 25th. They were severely attacked by the Chinese army along the way, and many Japanese were killed. The Chinese army is now encircling and attacking the remaining Japanese troops. (2) A certain unit of the Chinese army in southern Shanxi attacked the Japanese army in Quxucun, south of Quwo Jian.

### China Determined to Fight to the End to Deal With Any Eventuality; China Indirectly Fighting for the United States; Joint Sino-British Defense Plan Under Consideration

New York Top Chinese sources have confirmed that no matter what happens, China is determined to continue fighting. According to the program of resistance and national reconstruction outlined by Foreign Minister Wang Chong-hui, it will depend on the amount of assistance received from the United States, which must include aircraft, artillery, tanks, weapons, and financial aid (loans have reached US$259,000,000 since 1930). At the same time, because Japan is determined to fight to the end unless China accepts a "reasonable peace," there is no hope of peace as long as the United States continues to aid China. The reinforcement of troops in Malaya is being closely watched. It is also said that Chinese officials are obtaining complete information on the situation in Malaya. It is also pointed out that once war breaks out between Britain and Japan, Britain would naturally welcome China's assistance. Because of this belief, various factions in China advocate a Sino-British joint defense agreement. (United Press Dispatch, 26th)

British China Relief Committee Attaches Importance to China's Position

London At a bi-weekly meeting of the China Relief Committee today, the committee discussed the important position of China in the tense situation in the Far East. The committee decided to send a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek with the signatures of prominent British figures, expressing their hope to reiterate their past belief that China's united resistance and national reconstruction until complete victory and consolidated independence is an important factor in the peace and progress of the Far East and the world. The committee also decided to hold a national membership annual meeting at the Li Jiao Qi Dun Hall in London on February 29. Ambassador Guo Taiqi has agreed to deliver a speech at that time. The committee also discussed the official plan to specially declare in British newspapers the position of China in the Far East and the overall situation, and to urge the British government and the public to strengthen material assistance to China. (27th Dispatch)

Chongqing The Central Daily News carried an editorial this morning, stating that China should participate in the joint defense of the South Pacific by the four powers of Britain, the United States, Australia, the Netherlands, and India, saying that if Japan launches an attack in the South Pacific, the war will not be limited to the navy. Its army has already entered the Shan Province (transliterated) of Burma, and in accordance with the agreement signed with the British government, it will help Britain defend Burma. A spokesman said that the news was absolutely untrue. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)

The reasons why the United States continues to aid China can be listed as follows, according to top sources in Washington: The United States recognizes the Sino-Japanese War as part of the world war, one side being the Axis powers and the other being the democratic countries, which is related to the security of the United States itself. If the Axis powers win, the United States will encounter a strong enemy united against the United States in all aspects. At that time, the United States will have little hope of resisting it. If Japan defeats China, the interests of the United States in Asia will eventually be completely eradicated, because China is the one who resists the idea of ​​the Axis powers establishing a new world by force. Therefore, China's war is actually indirectly fighting for the United States. The Washington government officials acknowledge that the words of Yosuke Matsuoka in the Japanese Diet on January 21 are very accurate, that is, "the United States has a view that the first line of defense of the United States itself extends to China and the South Seas." The United States' support for China began before the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and its degree has increased day by day, until today, it has increased to only one step away from actual participation in the war. Among them, financial assistance includes a loan of US$290,000,000 for purchasing American cotton and wheat, US$25,000,000 for purchasing tung oil, US$20,000,000 for purchasing Chinese tin, US$25,000,000 for tungsten loan, US$50,000,000 credit for selling Chinese goods, US$50,000,000 for the stabilization fund, and US$60,000,000 for military materials. Among these amounts, China has repaid US$18,500,000. Observers believe that the use of various loans is extremely worthwhile, but critics believe that the current policy of aiding China is nothing more than a path to war. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)

Chongqing A spokesman for the Chinese government recently stated that China is considering a joint Sino-British defense plan for Yunnan, Burma, and Malaya. When asked whether it was true that China and Britain had signed an agreement on the joint defense of these three places, the spokesman said that technically speaking, it was a truth, but no agreement had yet been reached. But he also said that he could not say that this plan was not under consideration or study. Non-officials said that the Chinese government now considers it equally important for Britain to use Vietnam and Thailand as bases to threaten Burma. China will not sit idly by and watch Japan's southward advance, as this move will inflict a fatal blow on China's survival. Japan's launch in the South Pacific will also be a major move that benefits China, because the lives and property of the 10 million overseas Chinese currently living in the South Seas will be directly threatened. We must destroy this move before we can hope for final victory. Therefore, China must discuss the joint defense of the South Pacific with the related powers. (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)

Editorial

### The Soviet Union and the Turbulent International Situation

Recently, when discussing the future evolution of the international situation, we have repeatedly clarified the so-called center of gravity of the changing situation, and believed that it is necessary to grasp the center of gravity of the changing situation in order to see through the seemingly elusive phenomena. We have also tried to point out the center of gravity of the current situation. The so-called center of gravity is a term of physics. Throughout history, there have been many principles in physics that are applicable to domestic or international politics. Now, using the center of gravity to analyze how international turbulence is maintained, how it revolves, and how it tends to return, we firmly believe that it is easier to obtain an outline of the situation based on the center of gravity. However, the center of gravity of physics is not immutable, and there may be more than one center of gravity. If the center of gravity is reasonably shifted, even more infinite uses can be made. For example, military tanks can move up and down between hills and valleys without stumbling, which is the wonderful use of the center of gravity. When discussing international affairs, we call it the center of gravity because the possible shift of the international center of gravity cannot be discussed in a fixed way.

In today's international turmoil, although it is said that there are many clues and that it cannot be controlled by any one country, one thing, or one person, there is actually a key in between. Suppose, for example, that China has a question of whether to continue fighting, Britain's war has reached a critical point where it must either win a great victory or suffer a crushing defeat, the Soviet Union can no longer be ambiguous and must immediately express its support for the left or right, and the US war participation bill has been included in the congressional agenda for a vote. Of course, these are all assumptions and not realistic issues. However, the seriousness of the issues concerning these four countries is such that each one is sufficient to have a decisive effect on the entire international changing situation in turmoil. In comparison, whether or not Japan advances south and how the Balkans are safe have become minor issues. It can be seen that the so-called international center of gravity is indeed worthy of being re-examined at any time. In terms of the movements of the four countries, the Soviet Union is the most flexible.

On the eve of the outbreak of the European War, the Soviet Union was in a position of great importance. For more than a year, the world has only felt its unfathomable depth due to its silence. Recently, news about the Soviet Union has been coming in one after another, causing a great uproar. The most notable ones are: Firstly, in the Balkans, Bulgaria and Turkey are friendly to each other, and it is rumored that the Soviet Union is trying to win them over, but the Soviet Union denies that it has ever acted as an intermediary. Secondly, in addition to the extension of the validity period of the Japan-Soviet fishery agreement, Japan has stated that negotiations with the Soviet Union are proceeding smoothly; and it is said that economic compromises are the prelude to political understanding, and that relations between Japan and the Soviet Union are improving. Thirdly, it is reported from Washington, D.C., that American experts have confirmed that if a Japan-Soviet understanding is reached, the Japanese navy will have to deal with the United States; therefore, the decision on the issue of war and peace between the United States and Japan should depend on what actions Stalin of the Soviet Union will take in the near future. Fourthly, regarding the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany, it is said that although the two countries are not fully satisfied, the Soviet Union is trying its best to avoid conflict with Germany, so it is willing to slightly condone Germany's activities in the Balkans. Fifthly, Germany's efforts to win over the Soviet Union and Japan are not a new topic; however, the United States has reported that Germany is also using the connection of the Soviet Union to mediate the Sino-Japanese war as an important step in this topic. All of this is real and unreal; assuming that the Soviet Union decides how to support the left or right, no one can imagine how severe and far-reaching its influence will be.

However, the Soviet Union's importance to the current international situation is conditional on "action". In other words, it is actually limited to the formation of a center of gravity in the turbulence and the exercise of its decisive influence only when it takes some important action. We take the liberty of making a deduction, believing that although the Soviet Union is truly prepared to smash any invading enemy, as it has repeatedly declared, it has no intention of selecting an enemy, participating in the war, and attacking it. Assuming that it participates in the war, it is a real force, but it does not participate in the war. It treats strong capitalist countries equally in principle. In its view, any country such as Britain, the United States, Germany, or Japan is no different from the others; but there are differences among them: in terms of history, geography, and ideology, Germany and Japan are the most hostile and dangerous to it, which cannot be denied for any reason. In terms of international relations, it and Germany were extremely close in the European War. From the German axis, a marriage of convenience with Japan is also possible; therefore, it has always maintained a relatively distant relationship with Britain and the United States. We have absolutely no reason to believe that the Soviet Union will disregard its founding hostility and danger and stand on the same front with Germany and Japan to engage in war against Britain and the United States. Its tolerance of Germany's activities in the Balkans is also limited to such a degree of tolerance, and it is by no means directly or indirectly helping Germany. Its dealings with Japan, on the one hand, take the policy of not changing its aid to China as a necessary prerequisite, and on the other hand, it has not seen through what Japan expects from the Soviet Union, that is, to make the Soviet Union change its policy towards China as the ultimate goal. Secondly, it is not to fight the United States necessarily and become friendly with the Soviet Union, but to obtain the freest and highest elasticity to threaten the United States by becoming friendly with the Soviet Union. To what extent the future of the Soviet-Japanese dealings can reach is unknown, but from the Soviet Union's deliberate tolerance of Germany in the West, we should not only imagine that it will take the same attitude in the East, but on the contrary, we should imagine that it will not relax in the East.

### Tokyo Negotiations Have Made No Progress; De Gaulle Convenes a Meeting; Participants are All Senior Military and Government Officials; Thailand-Vietnam Compromise Proposal Has Not Yet Been Answered

Hanoi Lieutenant General De Gaulle, Governor of Vietnam, yesterday convened a meeting here with General Moltane, Commander of the Garrison, Dibo Tao, Commissioner of the Protectorate of Eastern Cambodia, Ge Langshang, Commissioner of the Protectorate of Northern Vietnam, and Dair Sarre, Secretary General of the Governor's Office, and Mang Duo Fani, Director of Political Affairs, to discuss the French response. Officials were unwilling to clarify whether their compromise proposal was the final or a temporary solution. However, according to observers, this is the final recommendation. When the Japanese side made this suggestion, there was a strict understanding that both the French and Thai sides must respond before Saturday. Of course, this includes Vietnam. Well-informed sources said that France's attitude towards the Tokyo negotiations has hardened. If the negotiations fail, the government will take certain precautions. Just as Vietnam expressed dissatisfaction with Japan, La Xi Folottier, Chairman of the Colonial Council of Cochinchina, published an article in the newspaper, saying that the Japanese attitude in the Tokyo negotiations is unnatural. Japan is not mediating, but dictating. La urged Vietnam not to accept Thailand's demands because Thailand's demands for territories in Laos and Cambodia are backed by Japan. French sources also believe that the rumored withdrawal of Japanese expatriates from Vietnam is a means by which Japan is forcing Vietnam to accept Thailand's demands. These sources also said that if Thailand did not have a third country behind it, it would not make demands. That is, some people in Thailand have said that Thailand's request to Vietnam and France's refusal, regardless of whether its request is justified, Thailand has regarded itself as the victor in this border war. The newspaper continued to say that Thailand has already claimed that Thailand's acceptance of Japanese mediation is to achieve its legitimate demands peacefully as it desires. Although it must be decided within a week whether Japan can propose a compromise condition that both parties must accept, the opinions of some Thai people seem to believe that a resumption of war is not absolutely impossible. The newspaper added that people should know that Japan is in a position of malicious manipulation in this Thai-Vietnamese incident. If it cannot achieve its ambitions through peaceful resolution, it may also be willing to see the resumption of war between Thailand and Vietnam. Thai has already arrived in Japan by plane and will arrive in Tokyo soon. It is reported that the Thai government is prepared to accept Japan's proposal and no longer make new demands, but on the condition that Vietnam shall not deliberately make things difficult when discussing the final resolution. (Haitong Dispatch, 27th)

Chongqing The National Public News reported today that one of the demands made by Japan to French Vietnam was that Japanese instructors train 100,000 Annamese natives, and another was that the Japanese air force be allowed to use all airfields in Vietnam. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)

### Soviet-Thai Diplomatic Relations Expected to Be Restored

Moscow The Soviet Union's Preparatory and National Long-term Trade People's Commissar expressed his gratitude for the sincerity of the reception from all parties during the negotiations. Montri is now on his way to Germany, and will return to Bangkok after arriving in Berlin. (Haitong Dispatch, 27th)

### Overseas Chinese in France in Dire Straits

Chongqing, the Ta Kung Pao this morning carried a special dispatch, describing the suffering of Chinese in the German-occupied zone of France, stating that there are 30,000 Chinese in France. After the German army occupied Paris, they lost their jobs, but recently, most of them have found work again. Chinese merchants in France can be divided into two categories: (1) small vendors, (2) those who run restaurants. Small vendors are still able to find work due to the blockade and transportation difficulties.

### Doubts about Japanese Intentions; Malicious Manipulation of Thailand and Vietnam

Singapore, the Singapore Free Press recently analyzed the situation in Thailand and Vietnam, asserting that Japan may hope that the Thai-Vietnamese war will reignite, so that it can implement interference. The newspaper said that the crux of the conflict is that if the war breaks out again, Japan can use the excuse of "protector" to implement non-peaceful interference. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

### Thai Ambassador Flies to Tokyo; Plans to Accept Japanese Recommendations

Tokyo, after the negotiations ended, people here generally believe that the hope of restoring Soviet-Thai diplomatic relations is imminent. According to reports, Soviet-Thai diplomatic relations were severed in 1917 during the Bolshevik Revolution in the Soviet Union. Until the recent negotiations, Montreux left Moscow and said that the results of the preparatory negotiations were quite satisfactory. While in Moscow, Montreux visited Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs [Molotov] several times. Restaurateurs are hit hard due to the shortage of rice. The sixteen restaurants set up by overseas Chinese in Paris recently asked the Chinese Consul-General to allow them to purchase four tons of rice per month, but so far, they have only received half of this amount. The 150 Chinese students are in even more difficult circumstances, with 50 being taken care of by the Sino-French University in Lyon, and the remaining 100 being extremely short of funds due to the disruption of remittances from abroad.

### US President Convenes Meeting; Discusses Implementation of Lend-Lease Act; Senate Continues Heated Debate on Pros and Cons of the Bill; Expected to Pass This Weekend

Washington, President Roosevelt convened two meetings yesterday to discuss the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act. In the morning, he met with Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Stimson, Undersecretary of the Navy Forrestal, Chief of Staff General Marshall, and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark, which in essence is equivalent to a "Defense Cabinet." In the afternoon, he met with Hull, Forrestal, and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau. After the meeting, he scheduled a meeting with Air Chief Marshal Dowding of the British Air Force and Hopkins, who had just returned to the US from England, to receive a direct report on the situation of the British Air Force. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

Washington, the Senate continues to hotly debate the pros and cons of the Lend-Lease Act. Government officials are trying their best to get the bill passed on Saturday. Republican Senator Nye of North Dakota attacked the bill, saying that Britain is using financial strikes to seek free assistance from the United States, and ridiculed the idea that Hitler would be able to attack the United States after destroying Britain. Another leader of the isolationists, Wheeler (Democrat of Montana), said that President Roosevelt violated neutrality. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

Washington, Senate Democratic leader Barkley said, "As long as the European war does not stop," Congress will not adjourn, and urged the Senate to pass the Lend-Lease Act as soon as possible. He also said, "The whole world is at war, regardless of whether we are belligerent or not, the outcome of the war is inevitable." President Roosevelt told reporters that the first task of the United States "is to assist in the war effort. Without achieving this fundamental goal, there can be no peace." Senator Wheeler, a non-interventionist, said that the President's words were "shocking." (International News Service dispatch, 27th)

New York, the New York Times correspondent in Washington reports that after President Roosevelt met with the leaders of US defense and cabinet members yesterday, he has taken steps to deliver all military supplies that the US Navy and Army can save to Britain. It is reported that the meeting checked the final list of central needs and the US's existing supplies, so that when the Lend-Lease Act is passed, the goods can be shipped without delay. A reliable source expects that some new types of aircraft originally intended for use by the US Navy will be immediately transferred to Greece after the Lend-Lease Act is passed. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Washington, the House Appropriations Committee yesterday released the discussions of the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Navy in Congress. Army Chief of Staff Marshall believes that the current danger of aggression is not as serious as it was a year ago, saying that if the control of the Atlantic Ocean was in the hands of the enemy a year ago, the United States would be in a helpless position. Chief of Naval Operations Stark, in response to a question from a certain senator, said that President Roosevelt did not specify the time when the Navy should be prepared to act. The Navy Department is working on the basis of early preparation. The process of building ships is progressing very quickly. The construction of warships is four to six months ahead of schedule. In his personal opinion, Willkie's suggestion to transfer more destroyers to Britain does not seem appropriate at this time. However, the government's handling of this matter should not be restricted in any way, because in the current state of the world, it is impossible to predict what the United States wants to do tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, and a certain emergency may occur, causing the United States to transfer a certain war equipment to Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### US House Debates Supplementary National Defense Budget the Day Before

Washington, the House debated yesterday on a supplementary national defense budget worth $1,533,000,000, which includes the construction of 55 destroyers, 40 mine-laying ships, several small warships, and 198 giant naval aircraft.

The bill also allocates $681,219,000 to the Navy Department, of which $169,000,000 is used to improve the Atlantic naval bases and the coasts of Guam and Samoa obtained from the United Kingdom. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

Washington, the House Appropriations Committee proposes to immediately allocate $1,533,000,000 for the expenses of the Army and Navy. This amount includes the expenses for establishing naval and air force bases in Guam and Samoa. The naval part is $838,000,000, including the start-up costs for building submarines, 400 pursuit ships, and other small warships.

### US Government Pays Attention to Strike Wave

New York, after the largest Lackawanna Steel plant of the Bethlehem Steel Company in Buffalo, New York, announced a strike, the total amount of national defense contracts affected reached $150 million. Picketers from a union affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations prevented midnight shift workers from going to work or entering the factory last night. The reason for the strike is that the company refused to rescind the order to fire some workers. Union leaders all believe that the strike of the plant's 4,000 workers may spread to other factories of the company. According to news from Washington, government officials are quite alarmed by the wave of strikes occurring in various factories and the signs of serious disputes in the automobile, textile, and coal industries. It is reported that the Automobile Workers Union has telegraphed the President, stating that the union has given the Ford Motor Company a 30-day deadline notice, and if the workers' demands are not accepted, it plans to call a strike of the company's 95,000 workers.

Washington, the International News Service learned from senior authorities here last night that Britain expects Germany to launch the largest sea, land, and air offensive ever seen in the next 60 days. It is said that Britain firmly believes that Hitler is preparing to attack on six fronts simultaneously. The British government believes that the British Isles, Ireland, Gibraltar, Greece, and British territories in Africa are highly likely to be attacked by Germany at the same time. It is said that since German mechanized troops landed in Africa and the "wolf pack" of German submarines claimed to have caused great destruction to British warships, the German offensive has already entered the preliminary stage. Hitler's recent speech warned Britain that a huge submarine offensive would force Britain to surrender or perish. What Hitler was referring to was this "wolf pack." According to people here, if the battle results of these "wolf packs" transmitted by Berlin are credible, then the rate of British ships sinking is more harmful than the submarine threat in the last war that almost allowed Germany to win.

London, a Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Cripps, going to Turkey is a logical result of the British Foreign Secretary's visit to Turkey, because the relationship between Turkey and the Soviet Union is extremely close.

The attitude of the Soviet Union is an extremely important factor in all Balkan developments. This time, Cripps will be able to make Eden understand the background of Moscow's political sentiment.

### Soviet Budget Committee Recommends Increased Budget: Deputies Engage in Heated Debate, Unanimously Supporting National Defense Spending

Moscow - The first session of the Soviet Supreme Council's eighth convocation of the Union Council continued yesterday morning. Ms. Nikolaeva, representative of the Union Council's Budget Committee, presented a supplementary report on the 1941 budget and the implementation of the 1939 budget. She stated that the Budget Committee found the budget submitted to the Council acceptable, as it was drafted in accordance with the national economic plan, and that the methods used by the People's Commissariat for disbursing funds were also rational. However, the Budget Committee recommended that the Council slightly amend the budget, increasing revenue by 990 million rubles and expenditure by 272.5 million rubles. In other words, the Council should revise the 1941 budget to 216,840,221,400 rubles in revenue and 216,052,224,000 rubles in expenditure. At the same time, it should retroactively approve the implementation of the 1939 budget (156,013,908,000 rubles in revenue and 153,299,045,000 rubles in expenditure). Thereupon, the deputies began to debate. Deputy Konievich stated, "The Council should immediately approve the national defense budget. We are extremely pleased with the victories of the Red Army, but we must not be complacent. The combat strength of the Red Army and Navy must be further expanded. The 70.9 billion rubles for national defense will enable the Red Army and Navy to acquire even sharper weapons." Finally, the deputies approved the 1941 budget and supported the 70.9 billion ruble national defense expenditure with even greater enthusiasm. Deputy Endersoff stated, "We must make the Soviet Union even stronger." (TASS dispatch, 27th)

Council of Nationalities Deputies Endorse Defense Spending

Moscow - The Soviet Council of Nationalities held its second session last night, with the agenda being the report of the Council of Nationalities' Budget Committee and the discussion of the 1941 Soviet budget. Mr. Korolev, Chairman of the Council of Nationalities' Budget Committee, moved to approve the implementation report of the 1939 budget and to amend the 1941 budget. The committee believed that this year's revenue budget should be increased by 900 million rubles, and expenditure by 270.5 million rubles. Deputies participating in the debate endorsed the budget and particularly emphasized the appropriateness of the 70.9 billion ruble defense expenditure. Deputy Alushanyan stated that the Soviet people were sparing no effort to strengthen national defense, which was particularly necessary in the current situation, and that all deputies would support it if there was a need to increase defense spending. Deputy Pylonsky stated, "Soviet Belorussia has made great progress in economic and cultural development. The expansion of industry in western Belorussia is particularly noteworthy. In 1940, the region's industrial output increased by 15 percent. There have also been achievements in agriculture. In 1940, 68,000 hectares of land have been irrigated, of which 40,000 hectares have begun cultivation. The region has established 101 tractor stations, 40 new schools, 4 colleges, 8 normal schools, 88 hospitals, 250 medical stations, 5 theaters, 1,100 general associations, 3,000 libraries, and 6 museums." At this point, Deputy Chevbakov further elaborated on the development of the West, stating that construction work in the Lviv Oblast of Ukraine had improved significantly. In a short period, 74 new institutions had been established, and in 1940, the area's industry exceeded the original production plan. Mr. Kaftanov, Chairman of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Higher Education, stated that the 1941 budget included a very large cultural development plan. In 1940, the Soviet Union established 40 new institutions of higher education. There were 600,000 students studying at 781 institutions of higher education. In 1940, 100,000 experts completed their studies. In addition, there were 1,500 Soviet scientific institutions. The 1941 budget stipulates 165.1 million rubles for the development of science. The Soviet intelligentsia are determined to do their utmost to ensure the implementation of the national economic plan, thereby strengthening the Soviet Union's national strength. Mr. Kostubekov subsequently spoke extensively about the development of the Azerbaijan Republic, stating that "the region is developing rapidly in the cultural sphere. In 1941, the budget for health protection is set at 65 million rubles. The region has 3,500 primary and secondary schools with 650,000 students. The region also has 66 scientific institutions. The 1941 construction budget for municipal administration and housing reaches 64 million rubles. The region's poetry, literature, and music are renowned throughout the world. The Soviet government is determined to assist the people of the region in developing their talents." In addition, Deputies Ibalamov and others participated in the debate. (TASS dispatch, 27th)

### The Impact of Pain on Society

Pain sometimes gives us a lot of trouble. When we have a slight headache, we can make the wrong decisions, and suffer serious losses in our business. If in meetings we are unable to express our opinions. As for the social world, it is even more damaging. When making arrangements, we have to cancel our appointments at the last minute.

Pain is also not allowed in the home. If a housewife suffers from menstrual pain, then the family life is full of suffering, the children are just messing around, and when the husband returns home, he sees his wife lying in bed, showing infinite boredom. Therefore, pain is enough to affect our physical health, and indirectly enough to affect the safety of the whole society.

However, we do not have to endure pain, because as long as we take one or two tablets of Saridon, the pain will stop within ten minutes, and is absolutely safe. No matter which part has any kind of pain, Saridon is the supreme panacea.

### Grain: High Prices Attract Zhaoyuan Goods; Ample Supply of Thick and Thin Japonica Rice; Imported Rice Still Dominates with Only Sporadic Offerings

Imported rice has been in a situation of "market with no goods" recently, for almost a week. There are rumors that the authorities are going to thoroughly investigate the inventory and force sales, "but like a loud staircase with no one coming down, not only is the stalemate difficult to break, but it is also getting worse day by day. Yesterday, there were still no goods on the market. What was offered was only the returned 85 yuan for No. 1 Siamese rice, 72 yuan for the second-grade rice, and 67 yuan for the second-grade broken tips. The rest was still only the original English-Chinese company packages from the road." It is unknown when this phenomenon will be eliminated. But the thought that these people are holding onto the spot goods, putting the people's food behind their minds, is nothing more than wanting illegal profits. However, holding on until now, the most affected are the general rice shops. Because they are suffering from not being able to purchase goods, and also have to deal with retail sales. In the situation of only output and no input, the store's stock is getting thinner and thinner, and they will secretly raise prices, sell inferior goods at high prices, and mix in large quantities of crushed rice. Those who suffer are still the majority of people without a stone of storage for overnight food. In fact, investigating hoarding is not difficult. If there is a willingness to avoid忌, and no determination to eliminate harm for the people, thousands of investigations will not produce any results. It is faintly heard that the Shantou gang has received 6,600-6,700 bags of Saigon rice, which will arrive in Shanghai in three or four days, and will be sold in the market at a limited price of 84 yuan and 8 jiao. More rice is arriving and is also being negotiated. It is expected that on the market today and tomorrow, even if the hoarders do not care about the life and death of the public, they will have no way to use their skills. Returning period rice is sold open at 99 yuan for No. 1 Saigon for February, 91 yuan 3-4 jiao to 91 yuan 5 jiao for small 絞 for February, 91 yuan 2 jiao for small for March, 80 yuan for crushed rice for March and April, 79 yuan 8 jiao for February and March, totaling 800 tons. Spot rice is 2,000 bags, road goods are 6,600-6,700 bags. The market transaction has gradually become lively, it is said.

Due to the repeated soaring prices on the market, merchants of thick and thin Japonica rice and other domestic rice have considerable profits, and are happy to transport it, resulting in a relatively strong source. At the same time, sales are slightly slack due to the sufficient price increase, causing the cargo owners to have a shout for higher prices, but it is difficult to achieve their wishes. As a result, the situation is stable, and the selling prices are similar to the previous ones. If Kunshan斛粳 is still 108 yuan to 106 yuan, Qingjiao thin稻斛 sees 104 yuan half, 104 yuan.

Among other goods that are running, glutinous rice is uniquely unrestricted. Therefore, general merchants are all using glutinous rice on the market, so what is filling the market is all glutinous rice. However, glutinous rice is a supplementary product. It has a narrow market, so how can it be sold in such large quantities? Due to uneven supply and demand, the market is soft, and the selling price continues to depreciate by yuan. Hong Kong special团粒 glutinous rice is 89 yuan to 88 yuan, long grain is from 87 yuan 2 jiao high, to 85 yuan 4 jiao low, and glutinous lu is 80 yuan.

### Talking about Rice Reserves: Observing the Rice Market

The current amount of rice reserves in Shanghai is very large, enough to supply residents for six months of consumption. Private storage is not even included. Food panic is certainly not to be worried about, but prices are still difficult to fall. In 1939, Shanghai imported a total of 45,765 tons of imported rice, with a total value of about 1,441,000 US dollars. Vietnam and Thailand each supplied 22,500 tons, most of which was imported at the end of the year, about 36,000 tons. In 1940, Shanghai imported 392,225 tons of imported rice, averaging 32,000 tons per month, of which 269,000 tons came from Vietnam, 98,000 tons came from Thailand, and 21,200 tons came from Burma. The purchase price totaled 14,000,000 US dollars. The results are not only that rice prices have soared, making them unaffordable for the general public, but also that the increase in imports requires a huge amount of foreign exchange, which is precisely to promote the devaluation of legal tender, and purchasing power is reduced accordingly.

In 1940, the turnover of importers of imported rice was dozens of times higher than in the previous year, and the profits were self-evident. More than 40 to 50 rice firms undertake sales, and then resell to more than 500 rice shops. After repeated sales, the price has become expensive by the time it reaches the consumer. As a result, people in the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors have speculated in rice, just like those engaged in speculation in cotton yarn and other goods. As a result, a huge amount of rice and grain has left the market and is hoarded in warehouses, held on without selling. If rice produced in the interior can be transported to Shanghai, rice prices will inevitably plummet, and those engaged in speculating in rice and grain will be punished. However, according to the Financial and Commercial Report, in addition to supplying the Japanese army, the amount of rice exported to Japan from the interior last year reached 700,000 tons, and it is estimated that the amount exported this year will be over 1 million tons. It is a well-known fact that Japan lacks rice and foreign exchange. The rice imported from the Chinese interior can be paid in Japanese currency without having to use foreign exchange. This move is of the utmost importance. Considering this need and the 400,000 tons consumed annually by the Japanese army in China, it can be predicted that the amount of rice imported into Shanghai from the interior this year cannot exceed that of 1940.

The amount of rice imported into Shanghai from the interior last year was about 30,000 to 40,000 tons, which is extremely small compared to the actual consumption of Shanghai. However, in recent months, the amount of imports has decreased significantly. This is固 as a result of the above-mentioned reasons, and is because of "bamboo joint control"去矣. Although there are rumors that at least 14,000担 of domestically produced rice will be supplied to the concessions every month, in fact, power is not 伊操, how can it be realized? Moreover, this number is only enough for one and a half days of consumption for Shanghai residents, and its relationship with the entire market is very small. Now domestic rice is very expensive, no different from being enjoyed exclusively by wealthy families. The supply and demand situation of Shanghai's food in 1940 is shown in the following table:

Imported Rice Imports 392,225 tons

Domestic Rice Supply 40,000 tons

Total 432,225 tons

Consumption 290,000

Remaining Reserves 142,225 tons

The above figure for the supply of domestic rice is based on market records, which is an approximate number, but it can be determined that it cannot exceed 40,000 tons. As for the additional sales of private transfers, although the details are not easy to know, its quantity is too small to be of any importance.

What must be known is that the amount of rice consumed by Shanghai residents usually does not exceed 22,000 tons per month, and there is a tendency to gradually decrease. The reason is that half is due to the soaring price of rice, and naturally there is节缩 or a change to eating miscellaneous grains, and half is due to the increasing number of residents leaving the two concessions. Therefore, the remaining reserves of 141,225 tons at the end of last year will not be shaken, and the imported rice that was imported in January and February of this year will be no less than 60,000 to 70,000 tons. It can be seen that there is a lot of imported rice in Shanghai, but the market is like this. 囤积居奇者之肉, 寗足食耶 (Lin)

### Flour and Wheat Road Goods Are About to Arrive

As the flour is about to arrive, the foreign wheat ordered by Chinese factories will also arrive at the same time. Merchant囤積心思冷淡, but 囤戶 believes that the current stock of現粉 is lacking, and before the arrival of the huge amount of途貨, they are still unwilling to compromise too much. Therefore, the market has been in a stalemate. In the morning, 500 bags of Blue Wheat Flower Brand foreign flour were sold, at a price of 25 yuan 8 jiao to 7 jiao half. The evening market loosened by a few points, but the high-end flour, Beautiful Brand, is still firm due to lack of goods. Chinese factory平賣粉 is still sold at 23 yuan for thousands of bags, all purchased by designated merchants.

Due to the increasing産價 of wheat, the source of purchase in the interior is dwindling. It is not easy for each factory to supply raw materials. Although the Japanese factory门市 has released prices, it is also without goods to receive. Chinese factories are waiting for foreign wheat to assist, and the limit for this wheat is still 40 yuan, but the market喊价 has reached 42-3 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Can't Afford to Eat Rice, Switch to Eating Corn

Selling No Less Than 700,000 to 800,000 Bags

Since rice prices have risen without falling, the people's food in various villages and regions mostly relies on various coarse grains mixed with food. Therefore, corn (that is, pearl rice) (bagu) (yu shuli) has a very lively market. Shanghai Port is still a hub for transshipment, so the miscellaneous grain market feels more prosperous. Saigon corn, whether for delivery or spot, has large entries and exits. General insiders and outsiders and speculators, because of the Saigon area being under the shroud of the world war, make the market price fluctuations quite huge. No less than 700,000 to 800,000 bags of goods have been sold before and after. At the moment, there are also about 200,000 bags in stock and not yet arrived. Because the city has destinations in North China, Central China, and Zhejiang Province, its涨风 is as fierce as rice prices. Yesterday's market rose first and then fell, but the result still exceeded the previous market. According to statistics, more than 2,000 bags of Saigon現苞米 were traded, and 200 tons were delivered in February. The market conditions are detailed in the price column. This city also has corn flour for sale at a price of 2 jiao 7-8 fen per catty.

Also on the 28th, 460 bags of beans were exported to Hong Kong, and another 170 bags were exported to Haikou. 14,400 pieces of bean cake were transported to Hong Kong.

### Finance The US Dollar Gushes Out

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC listing. The British and American exchange rates in the unofficial market opened slightly soft in the morning, but the trend remained uncertain thereafter. British and American banks were eagerly absorbing US dollars, while Chinese banks were unanimously selling them off, mainly in US dollars. Consequently, the market showed a slight hardening. However, the advance order saw a tightening, closing at 3/8 390625 in the afternoon. Later, news spread that China and the United States had signed an agreement, causing nervousness in the market. Speculators then began selling, and Japanese banks also released dollars, leading to a potentially loosening trend. Currently, the trading price for the US dollar is 5.59375 yuan, a decrease of 0.015615 compared to the previous day, while the forward US dollar is up 0.03125.

Chinese Merchants Sell Hong Kong Electricity

Early in the morning, the London big bar (gold bar) was stable for the near term, with a drop of 0.0625 for the long term. The New York silver price was flat, and the London gold price remained unchanged. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar was stable, with a slight decrease of one cent against Shanghai and no market against France. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning: British gold at 3/8 390625 and US dollars at 5.53125 yuan. Compared to the closing prices of the previous evening, the British pound was down 0.0325, and the US dollar was up 0.03125. After the opening, Chinese banks were the first to sell, and British banks also sold when profitable, resulting in a stable market. The selling price of US dollars for March was 5.53125 yuan, all absorbed by MacGalli and HSBC. At 9:30 AM, the HSBC listing was announced, and all exchange rates remained unchanged. The white silver equalization tax showed no change. Thereafter, the market was uncertain, but foreign firms were selling. It is estimated that in February, a certain American bank absorbed US dollars reaching 5.5625 yuan. Later, due to speculators suddenly buying, the market remained unchanged despite the selling by Hong Kong merchants Dao Heng and Chinese banks. It is estimated that the US dollar for March was consistently traded at 5.53125 yuan. The afternoon closing price for spot US dollars was 5.5625 yuan, British pounds at 3/8 390625, and US dollars for the next month at 5.53125 yuan, British pounds at 3/8 375.

US Dollar Rises, British Gold Tightens

The market appeared deceptively loose in the afternoon because Chinese merchants and speculators were consistently selling. Japanese banks also sold, first selling this month's US dollars to foreign firms at 5.59375 yuan, and then March's US dollars at 5.5625 yuan. At the time, rumors spread that China and the United States had signed an agreement, causing market volatility. Later, a certain American bank also absorbed speculators' March US dollars at 5.5625 yuan. The market still closed firm, with spot US dollars at 5.59375 yuan and March at 5.5625 yuan. Both spot and March advance orders were at 3/8 40625, an increase of 0.03125 compared to the previous day's prices for both spot and forward US dollars. Spot British pounds, however, saw a decrease of 0.015625, while forward contracts remained stable.

Hong Kong Exchange Rates Remain Stable

Hong Kong, 27th (Thursday) dispatch: The exchange market opened stable this morning. British, Japanese, and Shanghai exchange rates showed no gains or losses. Spot US dollars were up 125, at 24.5 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the market was reported stable, with no changes in any exchange rates. The market opened stable at 2:30 PM. Spot Shanghai exchange rates fell by one yuan, to 439 yuan, while the rest remained unchanged.

Tianjin Still Shows No Change

Tianjin, 27th (Thursday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. London and New York telegraphic transfers remained unchanged. The Shanghai exchange rate also stood at 90 yuan and 7.5 cents. The "United Note" unofficial market alone rose by nine cents, to 78 yuan.

### Retail Investors Sell Off, Gold Market Declines Rapidly

Yesterday's spot gold (cooked red) unofficial market suddenly plummeted. In the afternoon, due to rumors of a China-US agreement being signed and a rise in foreign exchange rates, market sentiment loosened, pushing the price down to within 6,200 yuan, reaching a low of 6,160 yuan. However, the market was very firm in the morning, opening at 6,300 yuan and rising to 6,310 yuan after the opening. Until the close of the morning session, despite significant fluctuations in between, the price remained at 6,267 yuan, supported by firms like Cheng Kee and Heng Kee. The afternoon started smoothly, but with the spread of the aforementioned news, Heng Kee and retail investors unanimously sold off, and the price decline began. Before the evening close, the price had fallen to 6,160 yuan, and the closing price was only 6,170 yuan, a decrease of 83 yuan compared to the previous day. The total trading volume for the day was over 30,000 taels. The spread (February to March) sellers paid out approximately 40 yuan. The cash price suddenly surged dramatically. Initially, Cheng Kee sold 120 taels to Xiang He at a premium of 460 yuan over the forward price. This gold firm then purchased over 500 more taels, and the securities firm De Fu purchased over 300 taels. Thus, by noon, Xiang Xing, Yong Jin, and Cheng Kee's 10 taels required a premium of 515 yuan. In the afternoon, buyers rushed in even more, and sellers hoarded, causing prices to soar even further. Yu Tai purchased 10 taels from Yong Cheng, reaching a premium of 600 yuan. Xiang He then purchased 50 taels each from Yong Cheng, Yu Xing, and Yong Jin at a premium of 980 yuan. Gold jewelry also rose by 10 yuan, reaching 590 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained flat.

Futures Prices Rise Again

Initially, due to bullish market sentiment, the trading floor was very active with buying at the opening, driving the price up to 6,300 yuan, an increase of over 40 yuan compared to the previous day. After the opening, the price rose another 10 yuan, reaching 6,310 yuan. Later, firms like Xin Feng, Yong De, De Fu, and Cheng Kee aggressively sold, causing the price to fall back to 6,255 yuan. However, Da Feng and Cheng Kee then initiated another buying spree, pulling the price back up to 6,310 yuan. Unfortunately, firms like Gong He, Cheng Kee, Da Feng, Xin Feng, and Yong then released gold again, and market sentiment appeared slightly uncertain. Thus, the market softened somewhat, falling to 6,235 yuan. Finally, with Heng Kee showing buying intentions and Cheng Kee also searching, the market gradually moved upwards, reaching 6,375 yuan. By the noon close, the price was reported at 6,267 yuan. The market opened flat in the afternoon, at 6,260 yuan. Ren Cheng, Yong Da Feng, Xin Hui, and Yong slightly bought, raising the price by five yuan, to 6,265 yuan. Later, due to rumors within the market about China and the United States signing an agreement and a hardening in the foreign exchange market, retail investors sold heavily, and Heng Kee aggressively dumped, pushing the price down to within the 6,200 yuan level, reported at 6,180 yuan. Later, thanks to a large Da Feng and others taking advantage of the low prices to replenish their holdings, the trend was stronger, and the price briefly returned to outside the 6,200 yuan level, reaching 6,320 yuan. However, the selling pressure then intensified again, dropping to 6,160 yuan, and the evening close was only 6,170 yuan, a decrease of 83 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 150 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold at cash gold firms was over 10 yuan higher than spot gold (cooked red), and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. The current benchmark gold price was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with little activity in opening positions.

Gold Jewelry Prices Rebound Greatly

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael was 690 yuan at 9:30 AM and 680 yuan at 2:40 PM. The price rebounded by 10 yuan at 3:00 PM. The result was that Da Tong Hang listed the price at 690 yuan, and the new Tong Hang's price was similar to the above, with the purchase price 30 yuan lower, it is said.

Foreign Currencies High Then Low

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a drop in spot prices, but cash prices remained firm. Thus, British, American, and gold pounds only fell by one yuan each. American dollar bills rose and then fell. Initially, Da Tong's large purchases led to an increase to 9.2 cents, but the subsequent loosening of the black market US dollar caused a drop, eventually settling at 17 yuan and 7.2 cents, a decrease of three cents compared to the previous day. The supply of Hong Kong bills was slightly strong, and the market price was slightly weak. Japanese gold bills and Korean bills were both in demand, and the market prices continued to rise, with the former increasing to 1 yuan and 7.7 cents and the latter reaching 1 yuan and 4.3 cents.

### Securities Domestic Debt Remains Firm

Yesterday's unofficial market for public bonds saw little activity in the morning because Xinfu temporarily stopped trading, and prices were slightly lower. In the afternoon, Xinfu resumed buying, and at the same time, Shunchang added to their long positions. Tong Shun, Xinhua, and Lianyi also bought, and prices rose slightly again, presenting a sideways trend. However, Ding Kang bought quite a bit in the morning, and Hong Da sold quite a bit. In the afternoon, Lian Tong and Kang sold. After the close, there was talk of a Sino-British-American economic alliance, and people saw stability. Changes are expected to come later, but for now, it's just sideways movement. However, the foundation is very firm, so caution is advised. The resulting market prices retreated slightly, falling five cents to one dime to three dimes. Type D and 96 bonds saw no activity. The total transaction volume was only about 1.4 to 1.5 million. A simplified table is listed below:

Category Highest Most Similar Most Sideways Compared to Previous Day

Type A 73.80 72.40 73.60 Down 0.20

Type B 68.90 68.40 68.70 Down 0.75

Type C 66.10 65.55 65.75 Down 0.30

Type E 64.10 63.90 64.00 Down 0.30

In stock trading, 50 shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of 51 yuan each.

Furthermore, the stock market at the Public Industry Association continued to weaken. The Yih Ho Cotton Mill share price fell significantly, opening at 44 yuan and later falling to 41.5 yuan at the close. International, Enterprise, and British United also declined, but their foundations remained stable. However, rubber stocks were quiet.

London, 26th (Wednesday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks were flat, with no changes in market prices.

### Cotton Yarn The Bulls Are Strong, With Slight Retreat in the Afternoon

The yarn market remained tight, and the bullish trend was strong. This was due to rumors spreading the previous day that the Municipal Council was conserving electricity, and cotton mills might reduce their work hours. Speculators took the opportunity to become active, and buying was unusually strong, so Shuang Ma (Double Horse brand) once jumped outside the 1,400 yuan mark, jumping over 100 yuan in the past two days. However, some of this was due to the rise in foreign exchange rates, the inability to sell current goods, and the low prices of mixed-brand yarns. Twenty-count Shuang Di Qiu (Double Globe brand) at 1,200 yuan was still not selling, 200 yuan cheaper than Shuang Ma. As a result, sellers released their positions outside the 400 yuan level, and the market was firm but with a softening trend. The highest price for twenty-count Shuang Ma was 1,416 yuan, and it was 1,386 yuan in the afternoon. Gold prices retreated in the afternoon, initially trading at 1,390 yuan, falling to 1,275 yuan, and the final price was 1,373 yuan. 220 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong on the 28th.

Shuang Ma opened in the morning, continuing the firm momentum of the afternoon of the previous day, and the bullish forces were particularly strong. The opening price was 1,400 yuan, immediately rising to 416 yuan. Traders then closed their positions for profit, falling back to 1,392 yuan. But the bulls did not give up, again going outside the 400 yuan mark. Later, hearing that gold prices had fallen and market sentiment had loosened, the price fell again to 1,388 yuan at the close. It was found that the turnover statistics for the half-day totaled 8,860 bales. The amount bought by each group is listed below:

Hong Kong 350 Ningbo 10

Total 8,500 Statistics 8,860

The current cotton situation is still calm, but there is news of factory reductions in work hours, making them less interested in purchasing raw cotton. In addition, cotton yarn sales are still scarce, so yarn prices are also uncertain.

The New York cotton market rose initially due to purchases by peers, then fell due to sales by spot traders and speculators, resulting in closing prices approximately 2-3 pounds lower than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market was very flat, due to small transaction volumes and no major changes in recent days. Yesterday, the forecast fell by about half a rupee.

Shanghai's cotton yarn trading market, cotton mills seem to be deciding to reduce work hours, so the foreign cotton trade has also become quiet.

### Piece Goods Factory Cloth Shows Little Change, Spot Eastern Piece Goods Have Few Buyers

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, prices first rose and then fell, due to volatile market sentiment. Prices first rose due to talk of reduced electricity supply, and then selling pressure caused prices to fall again due to talk of a Sino-US economic agreement. Fugui fine cloth opened at 43.75 yuan in the morning, an increase of 0.25 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, it was sold at 43.25 yuan. Overall, the prices of fine cloth and twill fabrics of various brands showed very little change compared to the previous day. Coarse cloth was firmer in the morning session but retreated in the afternoon. Transactions were not strong. Dyeing factories and hoarders on this street searched for and purchased over 400 pieces of coarse and fine grey cloth, and the Ningbo and Taizhou groups in eastern Zhejiang purchased 50-60 pieces of fine cloth, bleached cloth, and colored cloth. The Min and Guangdong groups purchased over 100 pieces of palace silk, colored cloth, bleached cloth, and other goods.

Eastern Cloth: Market sentiment remained high. There was strong real demand for white cloth and fine cloth of mid-range brands, leading to a continued increase of 0.25-0.5 yuan per bolt. Two Dragons Head fine cloth was affected by the discovery of forged warehouse receipts, and buyers were scarce, causing it to fall by 0.25 yuan. Fine twill fabrics also rose by 0.25-0.5 yuan each. This is because dyeing and sales on this street have recently expanded, and inventories are gradually thinning.

### Silk & Tea Shanghai Silk Exports Are Difficult, Market Sentiment Is Depressed

Overseas silk prices have been gradually rising recently. Both New York and Yokohama's current goods have rebounded considerably. However, difficulties in exports have led to no improvement in foreign firms' silk stock prices in this port. Yesterday, only White Filature Silk 20-22 78/80 had some sales, priced at 4,950 yuan. The user market was also quiet, causing market sentiment to be depressed.

### Dried & Sundry Goods Large Slices of Dried Longan Continue to Rise

Large slices of dried longan have been very scarce since the start of spring. Therefore, the firms holding stocks are defending them vigorously. The current release is small, but the market price has risen by over 20 yuan. However, demand is relatively scarce, and prices have reached their peak.

### Sugar Market Coarse White Down 7-8 Cents

Yesterday, the sugar market trend weakened further, continuing to fall by 7-8 cents. The association's pricing: 24th grade coarse white foreign warehouse spot goods at 79.3 yuan to 79 yuan. Small 8-cent futures for next month's 20th-day delivery at 80 yuan to 79.5 yuan. Small 7-cent Taikoo car white B-mark west warehouse at 78.5 yuan. Small 6-cent east warehouse at 78.4 yuan to 78 yuan. DY-mark west warehouse at 77 yuan. HX-mark west warehouse at 76 yuan.

### Coal Inferior Coal Briquettes Reappear on the Market

--They Neither Ignite Nor Burn Well--

The price of coal briquettes has always been either falling or flat. Although the open market is still stable today, competition among peers in the unofficial market is fierce, with price cuts regardless of cost. As a result, a few unscrupulous manufacturers, for the sake of business, often cut corners, mixing inferior dross with chimney ash to produce them. Their products neither ignite nor burn well. Shops, greedy for high profits, pass off the fake as genuine, and users secretly suffer losses. Therefore, it is hoped that the industry association will pay attention to this.

### Hardware The Company Iron Is Increasingly Expensive

The price of company iron has been rising sharply in recent days. This is because, given the situation in the Pacific, the inventory in this city is likely to run out of stock. Therefore, those holding this commodity are extremely firm and unwilling to sell unless the price is excellent. As a result, canneries, toy factories, and printing factories are searching urgently to prevent a shortage of raw materials. Asking prices are soaring. Yesterday, 200-pound old steel factory iron was selling for 220 yuan, and new steel factory iron was selling for 215 yuan.

### Seafood Annan Shrimp Tails Decline

The price of Annan shrimp tails has recently eased due to a slight increase in supply. Yesterday's market prices were: golden hook tails at 450 yuan, and Tianbian tails at 440 yuan to 430 yuan, about 20 marks lower than before.

### Economic Miscellany Different Forms of Numerals

— By Feng Liutang

Numerals written as 壹, 貳, 叁, 肆, 伍, 陸, 柒, 捌, 玖, 拾, 阡, 陌, etc. The Ming dynasty's Lu Rong's "Shu Yuan Za Ji" states that "it began with Kai Ji, the Minister of the Ministry of Justice, at the beginning of the Ming dynasty, but the Song dynasty's Bian Shi's 'Kun Shan Zhi' already had them. It is said that the numbers on coins and shells used the original characters, so criminals could easily steal and alter them, hence these were changed to prevent fraud." According to Lu Rong, who was from Kunshan in the Ming dynasty, what he said reflects the reasons why Ming people adopted this type of numeral, but there are already varying opinions. Cha Shenxing of Haining in the Qing dynasty, in his "De Shu Lou Za Chao", has a more detailed study, saying:

"In ancient books, one was written as 弌, two as 弍, and three as 弎, probably using 弋 as the base, and one, two, and three were attached to form the characters. It is not known when the single stroke of one as 一 and other numerals started. Cheng Dachang's "Yan Fan Lu" says: 'Nowadays, government documents use similar-sounding characters with more strokes to record numbers, so they cannot be altered for illicit purposes.' Gu Yanwu said that the numerals 壹, 貳, 叁, 肆, etc., were all changed by Empress Wu Zetian. Hong Rongzhai's 'Sui Bi' says: 'Ancient books and the Han people used one and 壹, two and 貳, three and 叁, with the same meaning.'"

According to Gu Yanwu's statement, there must be a basis. Wu Zetian often changed the characters, such as using "一人大吉" (one person is auspicious) for the character "君" (ruler), adding a stroke above the character "忠" (loyalty) for the character "臣" (subject), and so on, which is also possible. However, regardless of when it started, it already existed before the Song dynasty, so Rongzhai's "Sui Bi" has this statement.

The origin of the character 柒 (seven) is discussed in "De Shu Lou Za Chao" with considerable meaning, saying:

"桼 (qi) is the ancient character for seven. The 'Tai Xuan Jing Xuan Tan' says, 'Operate the seven policies (運諸桼政).' The 'Fang Yan' says, 'Wu has the Terrace of Qi E (吳有桼娥之臺).' Wang Mang's 'Hou Zheng Ming' says, 'Weighs fifty seven catties (重五十桼斤).' In Tang dynasty inscriptions, the character seven is also written as 漆 (qi, lacquer). Later generations simplified the stroke as 柒 (qi), and 柒 is the cursive script of 漆. Now it is written as 柒, which is another simplification of 柒."

I believe that 柒 being the cursive script of 漆 is quite credible. Looking at the following three characters, one is the regular script of 漆, one is the cursive script, and one is the character 柒, there are traces of brushstroke changes to be found.

### 柒

As for twenty written as 廿, thirty as 卅, and forty as 卌, they have been around for a long time and are all seen in the "Shuo Wen Jie Zi". Its explanation says:

廿 (nian, tone entering), twenty combined.

卅 (sa, tone suddenly), thirty, now written as 卅, ten combined, also written as 卉, directly as the character for thirty.

卌 (xie, tone first standing cut), directly as the character for forty.

It can be seen that the writing of 廿, 卅, and 卌 is a natural structure when writing numerals. Ancient China used counting rods, so the combined numerals were generally formed by combining horizontal strokes and vertical lines. This shows its remnants.

When the abacus began, I said in an article on counting rods and counters that I did not know its origin. Friends often ask about this, and I have asked myself, but I have not dared to speculate because I have not read enough books. Some say that it already existed in the Northern Qi dynasty, as seen in a book on arithmetic, but I still have doubts about the arithmetic book itself. However, what I can currently cite is that the abacus calculation must have undergone a reform in the Song dynasty, because no historical book has listed more books on calendrical calculation than the "Song Shi" (History of Song). For example, the equalizing balance (commonly known as the steelyard) also began in the early Song dynasty. When I have time, I will collect some fragments and discuss them with readers. I know that there are many omissions in the making of this anthology, but they are all jotted down casually to pass the time. All I do is record the beginnings of things and seek traces of evolution based on what I have heard and seen, as a resource for improvement, and to pave a path for those who organize national heritage in the future! As for details, we must wait for specialized books to be published.

### Japan's Moderate Rhetoric Has Not Changed the Stance of Britain and the United States Continue to Intensify Defenses to Prepare for Any Eventuality Empty Talk Is No Substitute for Demonstrating Facts

The "Continental Daily" commented that Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe declared yesterday that the Japanese government was not pessimistic about the future diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States. After Konoe's statement, the tension in the Pacific eased slightly. The key to peace or war in the Pacific is entirely in Japan's hands, which is known to all. Britain is currently engaged in a life-or-death struggle in Europe and is therefore unwilling to make unwise challenges in the Far East. The United States, while focusing all its efforts on assisting countries resisting aggression, is also unwilling to go to war with Japan and make Hitler happy. Therefore, Konoe's statement can indeed make the people of the Far East breathe a little easier. At the same time, Nomura in Washington must also be much happier.

The Far East Crisis Has Not Disappeared

However, it would be a mistake to assume that the Pacific crisis has already passed. Konoe believes that "if the path taken by the Japanese government is not wrong, there is no need to have any doubts, so we are determined to make Britain and the United States understand Japan's true intentions." The difficulty in the future lies here. Britain and the United States have already understood Japan's "true intentions" thoroughly. If you want them to understand further, it is an impossible task. Therefore, Konoe's statement cannot change the original intention of Britain and the United States to "see the cards". Britain and the United States will continue to intensify their defenses in the Pacific to be able to achieve victory.

Actions Speak Louder Than Words

The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" commented on Konoe's remarks the day before, saying, "We are slightly puzzled by what Konoe said, 'Japan is trying to make Britain and the United States understand Japan's true intentions,' but we are satisfied with what he said, the Japanese government is not pessimistic about the future diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States." Britain and the United States have already understood what Japan's "true intentions" are. Britain and the United States' understanding of Japan does not come from the Japanese people's moderate rhetoric, but from what the representatives of Japan abroad do. The power that Konoe and others' pleasant words have on Britain and the United States is far less than the Japanese soldiers in China tearing down a foreign flag, breaking into foreign people's homes, plundering foreign people's property, obstructing foreign trade, and injuring foreign nationals. Unless these soldiers are brought to justice and such incidents are eradicated, foreigners will recognize this kind of behavior as representing Japan's behavior, that is, representing Japan's "true intentions". All moderate rhetoric is ineffective.

### Rumors of Landmine Explosions at Qingyang Port on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway

The Shanghai-Nanjing Train Was Interrupted for One Hour, with Many Japanese Soldiers and Passengers Killed and Wounded

According to transportation sources, yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, a landmine buried by Chinese forces in the Qingyang Port area of Kunshan on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway suddenly exploded. The sound was deafening and shocking. The Shanghai-Nanjing train was interrupted for about two hours, with many Japanese soldiers and passengers killed and wounded. The landmine was likely pre-buried by Chinese forces.

### Lin Xionji Escorted to Nagasaki

Departs Shanghai Today on the Asama Maru

Lin Xionji, chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association, opposed the 41% tax increase at the foreign taxpayers' special meeting on January 23, shooting and injuring Ke Zijiewei, the director-general of the Public Concession, and Okamoto, the Japanese director. Lin was then investigated by the police station of the Japanese Consulate General. Lin was released by the Japanese side in mid-February and allowed to live at home on Disui Road, and he will be escorted back to Nagasaki for questioning. It is now known that Lin will be allowed to leave Shanghai for Japan on today's Asama Maru of the Dalian Shipping Company. The Asama Maru started from Manila and Hong Kong at 1:30 PM yesterday and returned to Shanghai. The ship berthed at the Huishan Pier and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 5:30 AM today.

### All Bridges Over Suzhou Creek Temporarily Closed

Honda Arrives in Shanghai and Is Scheduled to Go to Nanjing Today

The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Japanese "Ambassador" to Nanjing, Honda Yutaro, returned to Shanghai from Japan today. For protection, the Japanese side temporarily closed all bridges over Suzhou Creek leading to Hongkou from this afternoon. During Honda's stay in Shanghai, the bridges will continue to be closed for short periods. It is reported that Honda is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Nanjing tomorrow (the 28th) afternoon.

### British Ambassador Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai

Discussing the Evacuation of Overseas Chinese

After arriving in Hong Kong by plane from Chongqing on the 26th, British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr plans to stay in Hong Kong for a short period. He will then take a ship to Shanghai in about three days. In addition to the Ambassador's wife, his private secretary, McQuin, will accompany him to Shanghai to handle official business and discuss the evacuation of British citizens who have no important reasons to stay in the occupied areas. It is found that Ambassador Clark Kerr was originally scheduled to come to Shanghai before Christmas last year, but due to heavy embassy affairs, he postponed his trip and summoned his wife to Chongqing. Now that he has found time, he is scheduled to accompany his wife to Shanghai by sea on March 2. After completing his official duties, he still intends to return to Chongqing via Hong Kong.

### Three Million Yuan Worth of Copper Ingots Were Submitted to the Japanese Side Yesterday, and Maosheng Has Sent a Letter Requesting the Cancellation of the Whittle Case, but the Arrest Warrant Can Only Be Retrieved After Appearing in Court

The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the local American firm Maosheng Yanghang previously accused the Swiss national Whittle of stealing three million yuan worth of copper ingots stored in the warehouse of the American shipping company Ruifeng Transport Company. They also accused Ruifeng Company of negligence in safekeeping, and the case was postponed. It was scheduled to be heard this morning (the 27th). It is now heard that it has been postponed for the fourth time to March 11. About ten days ago, through Whittle's efforts, Maosheng Yanghang agreed with the Japanese authorities to sell the twelve million yuan worth of copper ingots (including the previous three million yuan) stored in various warehouses in this city to the Japanese authorities. It is reported that the copper ingots are currently being transported out of the warehouses and handed over to the Japanese side. An employee of Maosheng Yanghang admitted this morning that the copper ingots had been handed over, but said that he could not make a definite statement regarding the handover. The employee made no comment on whether Maosheng Yanghang's New York headquarters would call to approve the sale. It was also heard this morning that Maosheng Yanghang has sent a letter to the Public Concession Police Department and the Swiss Consul General to Shanghai, Fantanal, requesting the withdrawal of all accusations against Whittle for stealing copper ingots. Fang confirmed this morning that he had received the letter, but said that according to Swiss law, the previous arrest warrant for Whittle could only be withdrawn after Whittle appeared in court.

### Shanghai Coal Shortage Threatens Power Supply; Municipal Power Company Faces Similar Difficulties; Ships Requisitioned, No Coal to Transport to Shanghai

The Shanghai Times reports that Mr. Faris, Vice President of the Shanghai Power Company, told reporters on the 26th that unless coal continues to arrive in Shanghai on schedule in the near future, the Public Concession may have to reduce its power supply within one or two months. The company currently has enough coal in stock for three months. If no coal is shipped soon, the company will not be able to continue supplying all the power needed for long.

"Before the reduction in industrial activity in the Concession, monthly coal consumption was 55,000 tons."

Same Impact on Gas Supply

Mr. Brown, secretary of the British Gas Company, stated that although the company has not yet encountered difficulties, securing coal is indeed a problem. Since the outbreak of the "July 7th" Sino-Japanese War, transportation has become increasingly difficult. Purchasing coal from India is not a problem, but the problem lies in the difficulty of obtaining ships to transport coal to Shanghai. More and more British ships are being converted for wartime use, and the difficulties for both the Shanghai Power Company and the Gas Company are increasing daily.

Difficult to Meet Overall Demand

During the last World War, the cost of coal in Shanghai rose from the usual twenty or thirty shillings per ton to 1,400 shillings. The current situation is not yet so severe, but the shortage of ships has become a problem. Currently, residents of the Concession have a great demand for gas, especially since factories have difficulty obtaining coal, leading them to switch to gas. However, the Gas Company has already used its reserve oil-fired plants, but these can only supplement the main plant's insufficient supply and cannot meet the overall demand for gas from all parties.

### Deadline for Selling Off Hoarded Rice Has Arrived; Secret Investigation of Grain Reserves

It is learned that the Bean, Rice, and Grain Trade Association will carry out its previous agreement and has already appointed personnel to secretly investigate the true names of rice merchants and customers, as well as the quantities of rice and grain traded in the market before the 24th, for transactions that have not yet been settled. Once the investigation is completed, the Association will report to the authorities of the two Concessions so that they can be dealt with according to the law, to warn others, stabilize the market, and ensure participation in public warehouses and charitable rice shops. It is hoped that those who lack enthusiasm will understand the importance of the overall situation and that industry leaders will promote this promptly.

Rice Grab

Yesterday, at around 7:50 AM, a shop assistant from Jin Sheng Chang Rice Shop at 247 Rue Cardinal Fesch was delivering rice to the Gui family at 3 Lane. While passing by the same road west of Avenue Haig, suddenly sixty or seventy people resembling refugees, carrying bags and other containers, rushed forward and grabbed the rice. The shop assistant was outnumbered and helpless. Two bags of loose rice were snatched.

### Outstanding Achievements of the New Puyu Hall Inspire Social Sympathy; Mr. Lü Guicong Raises More Than 10,000 Yuan on Behalf of the Hall; Readers of This Newspaper Provide Unanimous Assistance

Since this newspaper launched the fundraising campaign for the New Puyu Hall, it has received sympathetic support from people in the community, and the amount raised has been considerable. Yesterday, we received a letter from reader Mr. Lü Guicong, describing his visit to the New Puyu Hall in Nanshi and the impressions he gained, which were sincere, passionate, and lively on paper. Mr. Lü said, "I have already donated more than 12,000 yuan on their behalf," and will continue to work hard to raise funds for them. He himself has also committed to a permanent monthly donation of 50 yuan. What a moving and great deed! In addition, a young ethnic Chinese boy sent a letter of praise to the nuns of the New Puyu Hall, willing to donate 200 yuan from his savings, and wrote: "Among those children in the future (referring to the orphans), there must be a hero discovered." Although this is a child's pure blessing, no one can deny this, because every infant born has the potential to become a great person one day, and success or failure depends entirely on education. Now, the hundreds of orphans at the New Puyu Hall are facing starvation. Can we stand by and watch without helping? We hope that the readers of this newspaper will respond unanimously!

Great Sympathizers

To the Editor of the Shen Bao: Recently, I have often read articles in your newspaper introducing the New Puyu Hall, which has attracted the attention of all sectors of society, and people have been donating money one after another. I also have general sympathy for the Hall, and I would like to share some facts through your newspaper. My friend Mr. Deng Zhonghe of Anle Factory invited me to visit the New Puyu Hall in Nanshi after seeing your newspaper's advocacy of this campaign. I was confused at the time and simply went with him. I didn't know that the place was so large, reportedly covering more than 100 acres. Many buildings were built within the walls, and the trees and air were no less than a park. The architecture of the buildings, although not luxurious, was not below the average level, and the cleanliness and order were equal to a good school. The people in charge are a dozen or so nuns who are often seen on the street wearing white hats. It is said that they are "sisters," dedicated to serving the church, without families. In other words, their spirit is poured into the hearts of the poor and needy, without any selfishness. At the time, I felt that if this was true, it was truly admirable. After visiting the classrooms, dormitories, hospitals, wards, and so on, it was indeed true, not only satisfying but also very moving. They sheltered about eight or nine hundred people, ranging from the elderly in their eighties and nineties to infants only a few days old. Except for the old, the disabled, and children under four or five years old who could not work, everyone else, big or small, male or female, had work to do, had considerable spirit, and had considerable discipline. In particular, the little angels around ten years old were lively and adorable. I think that these people, on the surface, are homeless and uneducated, belonging to the category of beggars, but in reality, they are blessed. No matter how old or young they are, even if they have food to eat at home, they definitely do not have such a good environment. I also think that the friends who live in small rooms in Shanghai, not to mention those who live in temporary shelters, even myself, who live in a new-style house with two floors, the environment is far inferior. For example, my son is loved and educated in my home, which is considered above the average level in Shanghai society, but he is far behind the little angels in the New Puyu Hall. Because parents love their children, there are always many inexplicable biases, either being too strict or too doting. In addition, the servants and relatives in the family add to the problems. However, the little angels in the New Puyu Hall are completely different. They have no distinction between near and far, no difference between relatives and strangers. They live the same, eat the same, are taught the same, and play the same. They have the same routines every day. First of all, they have discipline in their lives. What they hear and see is either reading or working. I dare to guarantee that these little angels have no impression of any bad habits from the outside world. They have been nurtured in such a good environment and with good discipline since they were young. In the future, when they enter society, they will not do bad things at the very least, and who knows, they may even create some great figures. As for the nuns, not only are they selfless, bearing responsibilities, and handling work in an orderly manner, but they also have a special virtue, which is "kindness and friendliness," without any temper. I have personally seen that the little angels treat them like mothers, and the old men and women also love them like family members. I also dare to guarantee that there is absolutely no such affectionate spirit in ordinary people's families. There are many charitable organizations in society now, but because I don't have time to visit them, I don't know what they are like, so I dare not say anything good or bad. The situation of this New Puyu Hall is what I have personally seen, so I dare to boldly introduce them.

How was their funding before? But now they have no funds. Since my visit, I invited a few friends for a second inspection the day before yesterday, so I really want to do my part for them. In addition to my own commitment to a permanent monthly donation of 50 yuan, I have already donated more than 12,000 yuan on their behalf. I will continue to work hard to raise funds for them, as much as I can, to seek peace of mind. However, my own strength is limited, and I know very few friends. I am afraid that a drop in the bucket will not help. Therefore, I am writing this special letter to ask your newspaper to appeal on their behalf, and I hope that you will often publish news of this kind so that it can attract the attention of the majority of people in society. I also hope that someone will go to visit and announce the impressions they have gained at any time so that the cause of the New Puyu Hall will not be interrupted halfway, and the old and young compatriots will be educated. This is a truly meaningful charity that is incomparable. In the midst of my busy schedule, I have written this in a rambling manner, and I still feel that I have not expressed myself fully. Please accept my greetings. Lü Guicong. 30th year of the Republic, 2nd month, 25th day.

Enthusiasm of a Little Friend

Dear Sisters of the New Puyu Hall: My Heavenly Mother brought me here to visit you. I saw many old men and women and many young children who have lost their parents. Although their lives are simple, they also have their joys. Their discipline is very good. The discipline in our school is not as good as theirs. I was very moved after seeing it and felt that it was all the result of your good management. I will give you the 200 yuan that I got from my father for writing. I will send this money to the Trust Department of the Silk Industry Bank on Sanma Road to be forwarded to you. Please go and collect it. Right now, I have a problem and the doctor told me to rest, so I said I won't write anymore. When my illness is better, I will find a way to raise some money for you. Please work harder with the children. I wish you all the best. February 23rd.

### Teachers and Staff Ordered to Evacuate; American School Prepares to Close; Student Dormitories to Close Today

According to the English-language 大美晚報, the American School in Shanghai's teachers and staff remaining in Shanghai, in light of the consulate's second announcement regarding the evacuation of Shanghai's foreign residents, have already made preparations to return home. The school's board of directors also announced that, while they will do their best to maintain school classes, which are scheduled to end on April 17th as usual, this cannot be completely guaranteed.

May Close at Any Time

School officials continued that the school may have to announce a complete closure before the end of the semester, either with or without prior notice. The school's dormitories are scheduled to close today. The notice issued to the parents of American School students is as follows: "February 22, 1941. The Board of Directors held a special meeting and decided to inform the parents of students of the school's current situation as follows: The United States Consul General in Shanghai has again announced that American women, children, and non-essential men should evacuate from here as soon as possible. The Board of Directors of this school believes that, under these circumstances, all American residents should comply with this advice.

Ordered to Evacuate

Therefore, the teachers and staff of this school who remain in Shanghai will have no choice but to comply with the evacuation order. However, the teachers and staff who remain in Shanghai will continue to teach in order to complete the academic year (scheduled to end on April 17th), benefiting non-American students and American students who have not yet evacuated. However, the school cannot guarantee that it will continue to hold classes until April 17th, as the school may have to close early. Some directors even believe that the school should be completely closed immediately. The school's boarding house is scheduled to close on the 18th, and boarding students will be directly managed by their parents or by those in Shanghai designated as responsible guardians by their parents as soon as possible. The Board of Directors of this school hopes that you will take these measures into consideration. French Consul General in China, Mr. Magre, in order to promote fire prevention equipment in the French Concession, specifically scheduled a fire brigade review at 9:15 AM on the first day of next month in the French Park. At that time, the fire brigade personnel will also demonstrate various skills.

### At the Border Between Zhabei Chinese Area and Concession, Entry and Exit Are Inspected

Recently, at various openings at the border between the Zhabei Chinese area and the Concession, such as the Xinzha Bridge, Wuzhen Road Bridge, Mianbaoshan Road, North Henan Road, and Jielukou, the inspection of pedestrians entering and exiting has become more stringent. In addition to female police officers stationed at both the Xinzha and Wuzhen Road bridges, who individually inspect all pedestrians regardless of gender, and require all packages and other items to be opened and inspected, there are no female police officers at the Baoshan Road opening. Therefore, women with suspicious appearances or carrying packages are directly inspected by Japanese soldiers.

### Labor Draft Spreads to Zhabei

Since rumors of labor drafts spread in the Hongkou area, young men and strong laborers along Broadway Road and Yangshupu Road in that area have been living in seclusion. Even shopkeepers are mostly elderly, weak, or women. Unexpectedly, labor drafts have also been reported in Zhabei recently. According to reports, starting from the night before last, every night between midnight and 3:00 AM, mixed groups dressed in miscellaneous Chinese and Western uniforms have been seen drafting laborers in sections of Zhajiang Road and Qiujiang Bridge facing west, passing the railway entrance of Beisichuan Road in front of Yipin Lane, and Baoshan Road, Gongxing Road, Dingyuan Lane facing west, Huiwen Road, Minde Road, and Song Park Road. On the nights of the day before yesterday and yesterday, sixty or seventy young men and strong laborers were drafted and transported eastward in military trucks. It is also reported that hundreds of people drafted in Hongkou have already been sent to Wusong.

### The "Kestin" Vessel Regains Freedom; Reloads Passengers and Cargo, Sails to Fujian

The British merchant vessel "Kestin Marler" set sail from Shanghai to Fujian for a trial voyage on the 24th of this month. While loading cargo at the Bund pier, the Japanese authorities detained the cargo and prevented its export because they had not been notified in advance. After negotiations between the shipowner and the Japanese authorities, the vessel has been restored to freedom and reloaded passengers and cargo on the evening of the 25th, setting sail for Fujian. The destination is Dongshi in Fujian, which is not under blockade, so it is expected that the trial voyage will be successful. Once the vessel arrives there, various companies will dispatch vessels separately to facilitate transportation. As for the cargo previously detained from the vessel, the person in charge of the company said that there are no longer any problems.

### Heavy Fog at Sea; Navigation on the Huangpu River Halted Yesterday Morning

Due to the recent bad weather and frequent heavy fog at sea, navigation has been considerably hampered, and all ships have been delayed. Especially yesterday morning, the fog at sea was even heavier, and the Huangpu River was also shrouded in dense fog. Therefore, no ocean-going vessels entered the port yesterday morning. It was not until 10:20 AM that the "Haikang" entered the port, followed by smaller vessels navigating the Yangtze River. Export ships were completely suspended for ocean voyages, while those sailing along the Yangtze River ports exported one after another at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Ocean-going vessels were delayed in arriving in Shanghai. The Taikoo "Suiyang," which was scheduled to depart for Singapore and Luzon yesterday afternoon, has been rescheduled to set sail this afternoon.

When driving along Hankou Road and Yunnan Road, four kidnappers suddenly appeared, all carrying pistols. Recognizing the No. 5179 car as belonging to Cao, they rushed forward, drove the driver Xie Kaiwen out of the car, and kidnapped Zhou along with the car, with one of the kidnappers acting as the driver. Zhou was actually mistakenly kidnapped. At around 10:00 PM, the car was found on Qingdao Road. Driver Xie Kaiwen later reported the kidnapping to the police station. The police are currently investigating.

### Murder Case at the Carlton Apartments; Perpetrators All Japanese; Police Have Notified the Japanese Consulate for Investigation; The Actual Motive of the Murder Has Not Yet Been Determined

### Gang Arrested Inside the Zhongzheng Hotel

Detectives Yan Kuang, etc., of the General Patrol House received a tip last night that a large number of thieves were hiding in Room 22 of the Zhongzheng Hotel at No. 604, Fuzhou Road. The detectives immediately went to the hotel and apprehended five thieves: Wang Pei from Wuxi, Tan Yin'gen from Suzhou, Chen Baolin from Shanghai, Chen Dongfa from Ningbo, and Wang Changgeng. They seized a woman's overcoat and brought it back to the police station. After investigation, it was learned that the owner of the overcoat was Chen Yunshang, a female guide from the Taishan Tourist Agency, who had been lured away by bandits and robbed of it yesterday in Room 426 of the Dahua Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. This morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that because the suspects had committed numerous crimes and there was insufficient time to investigate, he requested permission to detain them pending further investigation. After questioning by Judge Feng, the suspects were ordered to be detained for further questioning in a week.

### Tinsmith Boss Blackmailed for 20,000 Yuan; Case to Be Heard Next Week

Xu Fuyin from Ningbo, a tinsmith boss at the Public Bus Company residing at 217 Changping Road, is in modest circumstances and was targeted by bandits. On the morning of the 15th of this month, he received a threatening letter by mail, signed by a certain gang, demanding 20,000 yuan as a "birthday gift," otherwise his life would be at risk. On the morning of the 20th, a representative was to be sent with a Great Britain brand cigarette case with a specific mark to contact them at the Jun'an Lane on Jessfield Road in the West District. After receiving the letter, Xu was extremely frightened and unable to eat or sleep. He had to secretly report to the Gordon Road police station in charge of the area. On that day, Chief Detective Wang Cheng and Detective Gao Huixian disguised themselves as Xu's representatives according to the letter and waited near Jun'an Lane. After a while, a man named Hu Kou'er (30 years old) from Jiangbei arrived and was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. This morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated that the main culprits, Luo Ming and others, who were on the run, could not be apprehended and requested a trial. Questioned about the defendant's confession, he stated that they had discussed the matter at Luo Ming's house on Xingjiapo Road beforehand. The letter was written by his friend Lao Si because he knew that the victim, Xu Fuyin, was timid and afraid of trouble and they were trying to get lucky. At that time, those guys told me to go and make contact. In a moment of confusion, I ask for leniency. Judge Dong then sentenced Hu Kou'er to eight months in prison, and the threatening letter was confiscated.

### Highway Robbers Everywhere

Thieves Yang Genkou, etc. from Jiangbei robbed pedestrians of their property with fake guns on the afternoon of the 19th of this month on the corner of Xinzha Road and Park Road.

According to the 大陆报, on the night of Tuesday this week at 11:00 PM, a certain person was robbed by two thieves in Lane 596, Beijing Road. All his clothes were stripped off, and even his glasses were taken away, leaving him completely naked and shivering with cold. He ran to a nearby Chinese policeman to borrow a piece of clothing to ward off the cold and reported the incident to the police station. However, he was so panicked at the time that he could not distinguish the accents of the two thieves. Thief Gu Zhaoxiang from Jiangbei was found carrying two pistols and five bullets near Rubenson Road and Xiaoshadu Road on the morning of the 19th of this month. He was arrested by the Chinese and Western police officers of the Putuo Road police station's reserve team and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. It was learned that he and several others who were on the run had robbed pedestrians Wang Jinhai on Seymour Road and Wang Bingshu on Hart Road of overcoats and cash totaling 182 yuan between the 9th and 13th of this month. This morning, Judge Huang interrogated him and sentenced Gu to five years and six months in prison to deter others. The guns and bullets were confiscated.

### In the Case of the Assassination of Wu Qilun, the Perpetrators Appeal and Retract Their Confessions; The Perpetrators Were Also Involved in More Than Ten Robbery Cases

Lawyer Wu Qilun was assassinated in his residence on Tongfu Road last spring. After the case occurred, the Public Concession police arrested the perpetrators Xia Guifu, Wang Xingfang, Shang Jindai, and thieves Wei Shulin, Guo Guimao, Xia Shoufeng, Li Gongcai, Zhang Fucai, Wu Wensheng, Wu Wenxiang, Wang A'er, Song Wenmin, Sun Changfa, Liu Jichang, Ding Shaokun, etc., and implicated Gu Zhuxuan, owner of the Tianchan Wutai, and others. The case was repeatedly investigated by Judge Feng of the First Special District Court.

Verdict Announced

Guifu was sentenced to death, Wang and Fang and Shang Jindai were sentenced to life imprisonment, and Gu Zhuxuan was found not guilty. Regarding the robbery part, Guo Guimao was sentenced to ten years in prison, Xia Shoufeng to seven years in prison, Li Gongcai to seven years and six months in prison, Zhang Fucai and Wu Wensheng were each sentenced to five years and ten months in prison, Wu Wenxiang to five years and four months in prison, Wang A'er to five years in prison, Song Wenmin to three years in prison, Sun Changfa and Liu Jichang were each sentenced to two years and six months in prison, and Ding Shaokun was exempt from prosecution because he had already been convicted and sentenced in another case. The perpetrators Xia Guifu, Wang Xingfang, Shang Jindai, etc., and the thieves Wu Wenxiang, Wu Wensheng, Guo Guimao, Li Gongcai, Zhang Fucai, etc., refused to accept the verdict and separately engaged lawyers Wang Jishi and Chen Wenzhu to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court.

Filed an Appeal

Because the case was complex, involving not only the assassination of Wu Qilun but also more than ten robbery cases, the Second Branch of the High Court accepted the appeal. Yesterday, it opened an investigative hearing and ordered the perpetrators to be brought to court. The perpetrators of the assassination of Wu Qilun unanimously retracted their confessions in the original trial and denied committing murder. As for the thieves Guo Guimao, Xia Shoufeng, and Li Gongcai, who averaged more than ten cases, only admitted to one or two, with the aim of seeking a reduced sentence. Because further evidence was still needed and there were too many appellants, the court ordered that a special hearing be held again at a later date.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Education Department Releases Education Report; Subsidy Fees for Chinese Private Schools Totaling 315,000 Yuan

The Shanghai Municipal Council Education Department released its annual report for the previous year, stating that the Council approved the Economic Committee's recommendation to establish a special education committee. Its tasks are (1) to study the organization of the Council's Education Department and the current status of Council-run schools, to research whether expenses can be reduced or efficiency can be improved, and to review the subsidy methods, to prepare a report for review and approval; (2) to study whether the current education policies can be changed, and to refer to the suggestions made by the special education committee in April 1937, but not be limited by them. According to the above suggestions, they relate to the expansion of subsidy methods, the increase in the number of schools, and the restrictions on education funding allocated from municipal revenue. As of the end of the previous year, the committee's work had not yet been completed.

Last year, a total of 161 Chinese private schools applied for subsidies. Of these, 144 were approved, with subsidies totaling 315,000 yuan, of which 20,000 yuan was proposed to be used to set up a children's sports ground and a children's library. Sixteen schools have had their subsidies suspended one after another for various reasons. As for foreign schools, subsidies totaling 310,000 yuan were allocated, of which 250,000 yuan was distributed to nine Japanese schools.

Of the original school buildings of the Council-run schools, the Yucai Public School and the Xinzha Road Primary School have been restored for use. More than ten schools are still attending classes in temporary school buildings. The new buildings include the following two: (1) A temporary school building for the Singapore Road Chinese Children's Primary School is located at No. 29 Singapore Road; (2) A reading room was added to the North District Primary School, dedicated for the use of students from subsidized Chinese private schools.

Last year, the prices of various commodities soared, leading to a sharp increase in school expenses. Therefore, the Council discussed the issue of increasing tuition fees in June. As a result, it was decided to moderately increase tuition fees in all schools starting in September to supplement funds. Subsequently, prices continued to rise, so the issue of tuition fees was raised for discussion again in December. As a result, it was resolved to increase them again starting in February of this year.

Ten outstanding former students of the Council-run Chinese Children's Public Schools have received scholarships, and fifteen new students have received scholarships for their excellent performance in the entrance examination. In addition, some students in the Western Children's Public School have received stipends, either in the form of a full refund of tuition fees or a partial refund of tuition fees.

Last year, the number of students registered in the Council-run Chinese Children's Public Schools totaled 2,675, in the Chinese Children's Primary Schools, 4,343, in the night schools, 1,461, and in the Western Children's Schools, 1,287, for a total of 9,766 students.

### Xiaoshi Alumni in Shanghai Raise Scholarship Funds

April 25th this year marks the 30th anniversary of the founding of Yinxian Xiaoshi Middle School. Li Nengwei and other alumni of the school in Shanghai suggested to Principal Feng that a scholarship fund be raised to celebrate this occasion in a practical way. The method is for the alumni association to hire Shanghai-based alumni to organize a "30th Anniversary Scholarship Fund Raising Committee" and appoint members to be responsible for documentation, accounting, fundraising, publicity, safekeeping, and other matters. All alumni will be notified to donate all the proceeds from the entire day of the 30th anniversary to their alma mater. Donations are welcome and should be deposited in reliable banks. The amounts received will be sent to the Shanghai Ningbo Gazette for disclosure. After the funds are collected, any students in both schools who are rated as first-class and are unable to continue their studies may apply for assistance.

Random Thoughts

### Awkward

— Liang

To want to go, then go; to want to stop, then stop; to want to do, then do; to want to quit, then quit—this cannot be called awkward.

What is called awkward is wanting to advance but not being able to, and not advancing not being an option; wanting to do but not being able to, and not doing not being an option—*this* is what is called awkward.

Putting on a long gown is awkward—unable to carry a load on your shoulders, unable to lift anything with your hands; awkward. The rise and fall of the market is unpredictable; awkward. Going long is not an option, going short is not an option; awkward. Having no money is awkward, having money is also awkward. Having no money means not being able to fill your belly; having money means running the risk of being targeted by robbers; awkward.

If you want to avoid being awkward, there are ways: Whether in conduct or in managing your own life, you must first make up your mind and establish a foothold. If it can be done, then do it; if it cannot be done, then don't do it. How to deal with failure, how to deal with success—with these calculations made, boldly proceed and you will not find yourself in an awkward position. If the signs are bad, then don't proceed—you will not be in an awkward position either.

The most awkward thing is speculation and opportunistic behavior, being concerned about both gain and loss, what is called "being afraid of losing face while suffering from consumption." Speculating means fearing failure; taking chances means being found out—this is truly somewhat awkward.

### Mr. "Whatever"

— Xu Yi

According to Mr. "Whatever" himself, he is an "utterly" devoted practitioner of the philosophy of "non-action and yet nothing is left undone," a true "philosopher." Moreover, he is an unparalleled "recluse" in these chaotic times, not seeking "empty fame" but only "purity"!

Such being the case, a gentleman chooses his dwelling place, and our Mr. "Whatever" naturally settled down in the "pure and happy land" of Shanghai, where to "live" naturally contains the implication of "living in seclusion."

For three years, the gentleman's "Dao" has deepened considerably. He not only believes himself to have grasped the subtle essence of Daoism, but also to be able to promote and disseminate it to "modernize" it. What does "modernize" mean? The gentleman rolled up his sleeves, lifted his fat and heavy double chin, and smiled slightly:

"Wonderful! Am I the only one who can grasp the subtlety of this Dao!"

Thereupon, the gentleman's fat body suddenly "floated."

Although the "uniquely blessed" Mr. "Whatever" refuses to reveal the "heavenly secrets" to proclaim the method of attaining the Dao to the masses, you can, after all, comprehend a thing or two if you carefully observe his daily words and deeds. For example, if you ask him:

"Sir, what do you feel about the ×× incident?"

"Haha... me? I don't care about anything..."

"Sir, there has been a problem with the ×× Relief Society. What do you think should be done to mediate?"

"Haha... me? I don't care about anything..."

"Sir, on the day of the opening of the ×× massage parlor, they want to invite you to unveil the plaque. Will you go?"

"Haha... me? I don't care about anything..."

Hearing his voice is like seeing the man. Mr. "Whatever" is called Mr. "Whatever," of course, because he "doesn't care about anything" in all matters. However, don't be fooled by him. If you only know one thing and not the other and rashly try to learn his "whatever" philosophy, then I can tell you, you are sure to become a good-for-nothing poor man!

Because although he tells people that he himself "doesn't care about anything" in all matters, there are, in fact, exceptions (why are there exceptions? I say this is where his old Daoist learning is "profound," making it unfathomable). For example, when he sees the price of rice soaring, he will jump up from the opium den in triumph, grabbing the third concubine's arm with one hand and excitedly pretending to be calm:

"Haha... eight hundred dan of goods in the warehouse! Eight hundred dan! The day before yesterday it was... today it has risen to..." Although he can't calculate his "earnings" for the moment, in short, it has increased a lot. As for the numerical issues, in any case, there is a son who just graduated from the university's economics department to take care of it; he can "not care about anything."

But the worst thing is that I heard that someone wants to expose his hoarding in public, so he was so angry that he trembled and ran around to the west to get things straightened out. As a result, the situation did indeed ease up a bit, but after all, there were still people who dared to scold him in private. So the gentleman then took out his "amulet" and said faintly:

"Let them go, let them go, scold or don't scold, I don't care about anything."

### Bayonet

— Zhi Hai

There is no other way to deal with the world, only the word "sincerity."

Speak in a regular manner, do things with feet on the ground.

Do not take partial knowledge for complete learning.

You can deceive yourself temporarily, but you cannot deceive yourself forever.

"Humility" is the best asset.

Develop the habit of "doing today's work today."

(4) Unexpected Encounter

Although Zhao Si was the oldest and could be considered an old hand, he was momentarily frightened and flustered. Standing at the escalator entrance, he simply stared blankly at the two fellow apprentices whose faces had also turned gray, not knowing how to deal with the situation.

"I'll take responsibility for what I did! If he really dies, I'll pay with my life!" Zhao Yukun's face suddenly turned red, and the courage he had had before was instantly restored by half. Without greeting anyone else, he rushed downstairs in a hurry.

"Lao... Er..." Qiu Haitang wanted to call him back, but somehow, his throat was hoarse and he couldn't shout. Zhao Si knew his temperament and that he couldn't deal with this kind of thing at all, so he did his best to persuade him back to the room first, promising to take Rong Kui downstairs immediately to say a few words on Zhao Yukun's behalf, and then come back to report.

Ma Jinshou and several other supporting actors also heard the noise and crowded into Qiu Haitang's room to inquire. Some volunteered to go downstairs with Zhao Si to make arrangements, while others stayed in Qiu Haitang's room, everyone discussing at once.

He didn't know how long he waited before Zhao Si and six or seven other people hurriedly returned to report that Shen Mazi had not died, but was seriously injured and had been sent to the hospital. Zhao Yukun had confessed to quarreling and fighting with him in the police station, and had unintentionally knocked him down the stairs, causing this disaster. He was currently being held at the station and would not be able to leave until Shen Mazi recovered from his injuries at the earliest.

When everyone heard the news, they inevitably discussed it again for a while, and didn't disperse until dawn. Qiu Haitang simply sat on the edge of the bed with his head hanging down, unable to say a word.

"Lao Er has really caused a big disaster this time!" Zhao Si forced himself to cheer up after everyone in the room had dispersed. He moved his fat body to a chair close to Qiu Haitang, and said in a low voice, "Shen Mazi's disciples and family members don't seem to be good people! Just now, in front of us, they have been saying that they will hold you alone responsible for all the losses this time. Needless to say, our costumes will be kept by them. And until Shen Mazi's injury is healed, let alone Zhao Yukun being able to escape, even you may not be able to leave!" (42)

### The "Myth" of Ice Skating

— Zhong Zimang

The weather is cold and gloomy, just right for ice skating.

However, in the few remaining ice skating rinks, the crowds are sparse, with only a few tickets sold, while the dance halls next door are bustling with activity.

This makes me think of a year or two ago—

At that time, ladies in Shanghai were mad about ice skating, and countless opportunistic bosses converted dance halls into skating rinks, adorning them with beautiful lights and setting up "coffee corners," just like dance halls. There were even "ice girls" appearing as "skating partners."

Some stores were clearing out their stock of ice skates while ordering new ones from abroad, but still couldn't keep up with demand.

For "modern" ladies, carrying a pair of ice skates was more fashionable than carrying a purse.

At that time, there were also skating competitions, and some "skating stars" even emerged—their photos were on the covers of magazines, making movie stars envious. Yes, there were special ice skating issues and small newspapers.

It was really strange; summer was not the season for ice skating, but swimming pools were deserted while everyone crowded into skating rinks for fun. There was no shortage of sweat, but luckily, some skating rinks had air conditioning and electric fans. The ladies skated diligently, sometimes gasping, "Boy, bring me a glass of iced bridge juice..."

Sipping through straws, but the feet with iron attachments were heavy.

Beside the skating rink railings, some ladies were learning to skate with such diligence that their georgette cheongsams were soaked with sweat. Sometimes they would suddenly fall forward or backward in a big tumble, but they still skated happily...

The skating rinks also held races, dances, and costume games...

Sonja Henie became an idol worshipped by modern ladies. I remember reading an interview with an "Oriental Sonja Henie."

"Modern" ladies, regardless of the weather, skated, twirled, and rolled on the smooth floors...

But what about now?

The decorations around the skating rinks are also very perfunctory, as if they are managed by another group of people. The "modern" ladies are no longer seen—yet this is the season for ice skating.

Thinking of the past ice skating craze, it feels like reading a "myth" or something.

But at the same time, I discovered the epidemic of trends in this city.

Apprentices' Expectations by Xiang Er

Anyone who has read the article "Living Off Apprentices" in this publication on the 14th of this month will think of the suffering of apprentices being exploited. Not only do they receive no salary, but they are also subjected to beatings and scoldings, and even the duration of their apprenticeship is extended—these are all "ways for masters to make money." However, all apprentices endure all this inner sorrow, waiting and hoping for that one hope—the end of their apprenticeship—to become a shop assistant.

Becoming a shop assistant is a success for apprentices. Not only do they receive a small salary, but the boss—the former master—treats them much more politely. However, from apprentice to shop assistant, one gets older, responsibilities increase, and needs and desires also increase. How can one support parents and start a small family with just this small salary?

However, some clever bosses are particularly willing to help at this time. If you don't have enough this year, they will lend you next year's salary; if you don't have enough this month, they will lend you next month's salary. In this way, year after year, the shop assistant's experience in business can develop in a truly amazing way. However, the salary still cannot be increased. If you were to switch to another shop in the same trade at this time, you could indeed get a substantial reward.

Unfortunately, shop assistants today have lost their freedom, and changing masters at will is even more impossible because their debts increase as dramatically as their body, experience, and talent year after year.

At this time, the shop assistant—the apprentice turned shop assistant—remains as he was. He can probably understand the former master's politeness and help. Isn't this just another "way to make money"?

### Ten Outstanding Comedians of Peking Opera

— Ying

Since Liu Gansan, De Zijie, Huang Sanxiong, Luo Baisui, and others have passed away one after another, mediocrities such as Wang Changlin, Guo Chunshan, Ci Ruiquan, and Xiao Changhua have become dominant in the comedic roles. The lack of talent is evident. In the last thirty years, there have been no successors. Therefore, I have selected ten of today's comedic performers to form this "Ten Outstanding Comedians of Peking Opera."

(1) Guo Chunshan: Guo Chunshan's comedic performance style is a package deal from the north, proficient in both Kunqu and other operas. He is also quite old. He has seen Liu Gansan and Huang Sanxiong, and has partnered with Qian Jinfu in singing "Drunkenly Beating the Mountain Gate." In large northern performances, he is often invited to sing "Returning to Camp" and "Taking a Carriage." His qualifications are no less than the late Wang Changlin, Cao Ergeng, Sun Shengwu, and others, all of whom are his disciples. Last year, he came south with Ma Lianliang (specifically to take care of Ma's new theater) and gave a lecture on the Kunqu operas "Returning to Camp" and "Taking a Carriage" at the Shanghai Opera School. In general, his art is inferior to Zhou Wudi from the south.

(2) Ci Ruiquan: He was a comedic performer who stood alongside Wang Changlin in the early Republic of China. Because Wang helped Yang Xiaolou and Yu Shuyan, his position surpassed Ruiquan's. Changlin was skilled in martial arts but clumsy in robe and belt plays; Ruiquan was not skilled in martial arts but also capable of dialect plays. Therefore, in large performances at the time, Changlin would always be paired with "Little Shepherd Boy," "Green Screen Mountain," and "Linked Rings"; Ruiquan often sang "Liansheng Inn" and "Heroes' Meeting." In fact, Ci's robe and belt plays were also not his strength; his Sai Xishi in "Nengren Temple" was highly acclaimed among insiders.

(3) Xiao Changhua: In the early Republic of China, his position was originally inferior to Wang's and Ci's. Since joining Mei Lanfang's troupe, he has gradually gained attention. His robe plays are more commendable than his short garment plays. His voice is brighter and crisper than Guo's and Ci's. His Jiang Ziyi in "Heroes' Meeting," Tang Qin in "Examining the Head and Stabbing Tang," the innkeeper in "Liansheng Inn," Jia Gui in "Famen Temple," and Zhu Cang in "Beating the Nephew at the Grave" are all Xiao's masterpieces. Changhua is a major teacher at the Fu Liancheng Opera School, so the younger generation of disciples who came from the Fu School all treat him as a master. His son, whose stage name is Shengxuan, is also a disciple of the Fu School, specializing in comedic roles, and his art is based on his father's style.

(4) Ma Fulu: He once studied under Changlin and later also studied under Fu Xiaoshan. He is skilled in both civil and military roles. In the last ten years, seeing that martial comedy is not valued by insiders, he has specialized in civil comedy; however, he is clumsy in square scarf plays. Therefore, whenever he performs Zhang Biegou in "The Injustice Done to Dou E," De Lu in "Imperial Stele Pavilion," and Jia Gui in "Famen Temple," the performances are full of brilliance, unmatched by recent performers. Occasionally, when he plays Tang Qin in "Examining the Head and Stabbing Tang," Yan Pu in "Beating Yan Song," Jin Song in "Golden Jade Slave," and Old Man Pan in "Green Screen Mountain," it feels like nothing about him is suitable. Fulu's voice is extremely loud, and he can also perform the roles of old women in "Beauty Trap" and "Yanmen Pass," and painted faces in "Weishui River" and "Famen Temple."

(5) Jia Duocai: He is also an old performer among recent actors. This person is better at comedic old woman roles, and his art is based on Chi Zijun, his grandfather. His imitation of Chi is better than that of Chi's disciple Xiao Shoushan. His Sai Xishi in "Nengren Temple" is no less than Ci Ruiquan's.

(6) Ru Fuwei: Fuwei's art, in terms of square scarf plays, diligently studies Xiao Ershun (Changhua), and in terms of short garment plays, his physical expression is better than Ma Fulu's. His voice is also not weak. Following the rules and regulations is his strength. Because he does not like to cater to vulgar tastes, many laymen and theatergoers prefer Fulu and abandon Fuwei. This is why Ru's fame is not as great as Ma's.

(7) Cao Ergeng: Cao is a disciple of Guo. He is better at short garment plays. He is suitable for playing naive and simple characters. His voice and expression are all commendable. He has been with Cheng Yanqiu for a long time. His Zhang Lver in "The Golden Lock Record" and the yamen runner in "The Vermilion Mark Record" are all masterpieces.

(8) Wang Fushan: Fushan is Changlin's son. His art is mediocre, but he adheres to the rules. He once drifted to Zhangjiakou. Yang Xiaolou and Yu Shuyan, out of their old friendship with Changlin, summoned him to be a supporting actor. His art is similar to his father's, unskilled in both civil and military roles, but his voice is not as good as Changlin's. The woodcutter in "Asking the Woodcutter," the family servant in "Stealing the Imperial Scroll," Zhu Guangzu in "Stealing the Hook," and Hu Cheer in "Stealing the Halberd" all have some of Changlin's style. In recent years, his artistic skills seem to be inferior to before, and his martial skills have deteriorated even more.

(9) Luo Wenkui: Wenkui is a descendant of Luo Fushan. His art is very ordinary. Except for not being skilled in martial arts, his civil plays seem to be better than Wang Changlin's. He has been a supporting actor for Mei Lanfang, Yu Shuyan, and Xi Yunfu. In recent years, his voice has deteriorated, and he does not often perform in troupes. Last year, through the introduction of Li Hongchun, he came to Shanghai to teach at the Opera School, teaching comedic and old woman roles.

(10) Sun Shengwu: Shengwu is from Suzhou. His grandfather lived in Beijing. He has an elder brother named Shengwen, who is a professional actor singing painted faces. Both of them attended the Fu Liancheng Opera School. Shengwen is now a teacher at the school. Shengwu's art, Kunqu opera, was learned from Guo Chunshan, and his square scarf plays were taught by Xiao Changhua. His expression, physical movements, and steps are all very good. His comedic old woman roles are especially good. It is a pity that this child's voice is rough and his stature is short. Otherwise, he would be a complete talent in civil comedy.

New Film Introduction

### "Mandarin Duck Tribulation"

— Cheng Bingnu

"Mandarin Duck Tribulation" is a famous work by the British literary giant John Galsworthy, originally titled The First and The Last. Now, it has been brought to the screen and turned into 21 Days Together, which is also quite moving. The film stars Vivien Leigh from "Gone with the Wind" and Laurence Olivier, the male lead from "Rebecca," so its quality is guaranteed to be excellent.

Although this film does not break away from the typical Hollywood love drama, its theme is not simply "love above all else." Galsworthy advocated for humanity, and he vehemently criticized a gentleman who intended to frame others (in the film, he is Laurence's brother). He wrote the protagonist, Laurence, as someone unwilling to betray his conscience for love. Therefore, when he learns that the innocent, frustrated pastor who was arrested has been legally found guilty, he becomes worried and restless all day long, disregarding his brother's advice and his brother's future. He decides to confess because he, not the pastor, strangled his lover Vivien Leigh's ex-husband.

The story develops very powerfully, starting from when Laurence accompanies Vivien Leigh home, passing through the strangling, escape, court hearing, and until the pastor is sentenced to death after twenty-one days. It is truly like peeling a banana, one step after another. Then, Laurence decides to revel with Vivien Leigh as much as possible within these short twenty-one days, preparing to confess before the pastor is executed. The plot here seems to take another turn. The screen shows quick sketches of the two reveling, like "a bomb lurking, waiting to explode when the fuse burns to the end."

The twenty-one days pass in a short moment. Laurence thinks of the poor pastor and decides to confess. On the screen, we see Laurence striding towards the court, Vivien Leigh following closely behind him. They pass through crowded streets, pushing through the bustling pedestrians. Laurence walks faster and faster. Vivien Leigh sees that she cannot keep up. At this moment, someone on the street shouts about a newspaper report, saying that the pastor has died of illness in prison. Vivien Leigh, after reading the newspaper, is even more panicked, fearing that Laurence has already reached the court. Therefore, she chases after him tightly, finally catching up to him at the last moment, at the entrance of the court, and telling him that the pastor has died and that confessing is unnecessary. The plot, like a stampede of ten thousand horses, is only pulled back here, and the audience, after being anxious and nervous, can finally breathe a sigh of relief. The director's handling of this climax can be described as extremely energetic and surging, tightly controlling the emotions of every audience member.

Vivien Leigh's acting is consistently delicate and moving, forming its own style compared to "Gone with the Wind." Laurence is calm and decisive, fitting the identity of the character in the play, making it a fine piece of work.

(General answer to Xu Zonghua, Huang Keming, and Wang Deping, who suffer from bad breath) Bad breath comes from indigestion. On one hand, you should control your diet, and on the other hand, you should facilitate bowel movements. After each meal, you should also brush your teeth diligently.

(General answer to three people regarding the foreskin) (Mr. Deng Shihua) It is probably caused by an overly long foreskin that easily accumulates dirt. It is best to consult a doctor for examination. If it is too long, removing it will eliminate this phenomenon. (Mr. Liu Wenjun) It is best to remove the foreskin, one to avoid the accumulation of dirt inside the phimosis, two to avoid hindering fertility, and three to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. (Mr. Jin Wenjie) This is dirt accumulated inside the foreskin, not a disease.

(Mr. Xu Yongcheng) I am unmarried, and I have no evil thoughts during the day while working, nor do I get close to women, but after falling asleep, I often wake up with an erection. Why is this?

(Answer) This is a physiological phenomenon, not a pathological phenomenon. Please do not worry.

(Mr. Wang Taisheng) My friend is twenty years old and got into a fight with a neighbor, resulting in a lot of his hair being pulled out by the other party. It has been over a month now, and it has not grown back. I wonder if it will grow back?

(Answer) It will grow back soon. Observe the grass in the courtyard in summer. If you pull it out, it will definitely grow back.
