### Chinese Ambassador to England, Gu Weijun, Meets with the British King to Present Credentials, Gu Holds Reception at the Embassy, China's Four Years of Warfare Highly Praised by the British

Reuters, London, 11th – Chinese Ambassador to England, Gu Weijun, yesterday met with the British King to present his credentials. British Foreign Secretary Eden was also present. Ambassador Gu also led eight people, including Chinese Embassy Counselors Yu Ming, Shi Zhaokui, and First Secretary, in meeting with the King.

Reuters, London, 11th – After the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to England, Dr. Gu Weijun, arrived here, Graves, who served as the foreign news editor of The Times for many years, said at the embassy's reception: "We deeply admire and are extremely grateful to your government and people. Your country's warfare has greatly assisted Britain and the English-speaking people in general. If the Chinese government had advocated prudence and appeasement at the beginning of the China Incident, I fear that militaristic Japan, emboldened by China's surrender, would not have been willing to remain subservient. Although the South Seas are still in grave danger, Japan's blade has been dulled, and the weapons it uses are no longer as sharp as they were four years ago. We welcome Your Excellency as the representative of a great ancient country that is now waging the same war as us in pursuit of fairness, order, and fidelity in international relations." Zhang Xuelou, former Far East Manager of Reuters and an old friend of Dr. Gu, also gave a speech, saying, "I first met Dr. Gu in Nanjing in 1931. At that time, when the national affairs were critical, Dr. Gu disregarded his own danger and took on the difficult task of Chinese Foreign Minister under the order of Chairman Chiang. The following spring, I accompanied Dr. Gu to the three northeastern provinces. Dr. Gu, as the representative of the Chinese government, accompanied the League of Nations investigation team to the three northeastern provinces to conduct an unappreciated and ultimately fruitless investigation. I still remember Dr. Gu's indomitable posture in the streets of Fengtian, serving the country with a fearless spirit in an environment surrounded by malicious gazes. We are fortunate to have such a prominent diplomat representing China in London, and at the same time, we have our close friend Dr. Guo Taiqi as the Chinese Foreign Minister in Chongqing. We deeply believe that this will be a solid bridge of friendship and understanding between the two major capitals and the two major democracies."

### American Journalist Ingersoll to Visit China

United Press, New York, 11th – Ingersoll, former editor of "Time" magazine and now the owner of the New York "PM" newspaper, flew to San Francisco yesterday and will transfer to a ship to Honolulu, then fly to Chongqing, Moscow, and London. He has scheduled meetings with Chairman Chiang, Stalin, and Churchill. Ingersoll said he will reside in Chongqing for a week to investigate the military and the morale of the people. Since Britain is resisting the German army in the English Channel and China is resisting the Japanese army in the inland day after day, the United States must take responsibility to immediately send effective assistance to defeat the invading countries. Ingersoll has met with President Roosevelt and Dr. Cooley. The trip is scheduled to arrive in Rangoon on July 28.

### Mines Placed in San Francisco Waterway

United Press, Washington, 11th – The Navy Department announced yesterday that mines were placed in the waterway near San Francisco Bay on June 28. This condition will continue indefinitely.

Reuters, Berlin, 11th – The German official news agency reported that the Chinese Ambassador to Germany, Chen Jie, left the German capital last night with his entourage for Switzerland, and will return to Chongqing via the United States.

### Icelandic Parliament Approves U.S. Navy Garrison, Hoping U.S. Will Recognize Iceland's Freedom and Sovereignty Like Britain

United Press, Reykjavik, 11th – The Icelandic Parliament yesterday approved the agreement between the government and the United States by a vote of 49 to 3. The agreement stipulates that the United States assumes the responsibility of protecting Iceland by military means. Those who voted against were all communists. The resolution passed by the Icelandic Parliament reads as follows: "The Icelandic Parliament approves the agreement between the Icelandic government and the United States government, stipulating that the United States shall be responsible for protecting Iceland by force during this war." At the same time, it is reported that the Regent of Iceland met with senior U.S. Army and Navy officers commanding the U.S. troops here on Wednesday. Yesterday, personnel from U.S. warships and supply ships, as well as aviators and troops, gathered in the streets here, buying souvenirs and surrounding the doors of various candy stores and ice cream parlors in heavy rain. Prime Minister Jónasson convened a special meeting of Parliament to report on the transfer of the right to occupy Iceland by force from Britain to the United States. Jónasson said that the British government, in its reply to him, stated that it recognized Iceland's sovereign independence and other rights under the peace treaty. It also stated that Britain would withdraw all British troops as soon as the United States had sufficient troops stationed in Iceland. Britain also agreed to increase trade with Iceland instead of reducing it. Mr. Jónasson also said that Iceland had requested Britain to release seven civilians detained in England. Finally, Britain has recognized that under the new procedures, the previous British declaration regarding the recognition of Iceland's free sovereignty has not changed, and both countries have agreed to be bound by their current diplomatic relations. Mr. Jónasson praised the good behavior of the British troops during their occupation of Iceland, and he dared to assert that the American soldiers would also be extremely satisfactory.

### U.S. Isolationist Senator Criticizes the Trusteeship of Iceland, Saying "This is No Different from a War of Aggression"

United Press, Washington, 11th – Ohio Republican Senator Taft declared yesterday that a few weeks ago, "reliable authorities" had told him that the United States was building a naval and air base for Britain in Northern Ireland. Taft criticized the U.S. military occupation of Iceland, saying that the United States could use the same excuse to send troops to Ireland, Scotland, England, or Portugal. He also said that the above countries are very close to Iceland, and we will now be forced to protect a soldier already in Iceland. The U.S. military occupation of Iceland may allow 500,000 British troops to be transferred to other services, with 500,000 U.S. troops replacing them. If the U.S. military obtains a base in Ireland, it will be more effective in protecting British shipping than Iceland." Taft also said that he protested against the U.S. occupation of Iceland. If this policy continues, "Congress's constitutional right to declare war will become useless." Taft, a leading isolationist senator, said that President Roosevelt only has the right to take action to protect the U.S. mainland and has no right to launch a war of aggression. He also said that the occupation of Iceland is no different from a war of aggression. He has now sent 80,000 soldiers deep into the center of a foreign war zone." Taft ridiculed the view that Germany would attack the United States, saying that if the Nazis controlled the entire European naval line and the British Isles, the 80,000 U.S. troops in Iceland would only be a burden to the United States because "we cannot send a fleet to the Arctic Circle to protect them. At that time, we will lose all 80,000 soldiers in Iceland."

United Press, Washington, 11th – North Dakota Republican Senator Nye yesterday attacked the U.S. entry into Iceland. Nye, a staunch isolationist, said in the Senate, "Our leaders seem impatient because we have not been attacked." Referring to British Prime Minister Churchill's criticism of Senator Wheeler for prematurely announcing that U.S. troops would occupy Iceland, Nye declared, "It is disturbing that a foreign leader should criticize an American like Mr. Wheeler. In fact, Churchill seems to think we are his colony." Churchill's criticism of Wheeler's announcement was because it could endanger the lives of British troops withdrawing from Iceland.

### Peru and Ecuador Send Representatives to the United States to Negotiate Peace, Peruvian Cabinet Agrees to Peaceful Resolution, Mexico Sends Note to Both Countries

United Press, Miami, 11th – Two special envoys representing Peru and Ecuador arrived here last night and will travel to Washington to meet with U.S. officials to discuss a resolution to the border conflict that began last Saturday. The arrival of Dr. Concha, former Peruvian Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Eighth Pan-American Conference, was expected, but the arrival of Rafael, the special envoy representing Ecuador, on the same U.S. plane was unexpected. Both representatives declined to comment on the recent conflict caused by the old border dispute.

Haitong News Agency, Capital of Chile, 11th – According to news from the capital of Peru, the Peruvian cabinet held a cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon, which lasted a long time. It is reported that they have agreed to a peaceful resolution of the Peruvian-Ecuadorian conflict.

Havas, Mexico City, 10th – After the governments of the United States, Argentina, and Brazil requested Peru and Ecuador to cease fire, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent notes to both Peru and Ecuador to promote the acceptance of the three countries' proposal, which stated: "At this time of serious international situation, the border dispute between Peru and Ecuador should be resolved quickly, so that the unity of the countries in the pan-American region can be clearly demonstrated."

### U.S. Has No Intention of Seeking Overseas Bases

Reuters, Washington, 11th – Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday answered questions from reporters based on Tokyo's broadcast news, saying that the United States does not want to seek naval and army bases in Portugal or Portuguese territories, or in Siberia. The external rumors are obviously German propaganda aimed at causing disputes between the United States and Japan. The broadcast news, reported by Tokyo newspapers, claimed that the United States, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union are about to form an alliance, and the United States will establish military bases on the Kamchatka Peninsula.

Editorial

### Quietly Observing the Implementation of the Exchange Stabilization Plan

Since Mr. Fox, a member of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, arrived in Shanghai, Shanghai's black foreign exchange market has suddenly fluctuated, rising and falling sharply. Many comments have been made in connection with this, some saying one thing is right, others saying another is right, and there is no time to discuss who is right and who is wrong. However, when it comes to foreign exchange, it is multifaceted and complex, and cannot be solved by a simple statement. Moreover, today's Shanghai foreign exchange, since it is called a black market, it is inevitably true to its name, and it is even more difficult to find a proper solution. As an old saying goes, "It is difficult to have everything." It is already difficult to have everything, and it is even more difficult to seek perfection in all aspects. Generally speaking, every matter is accompanied by both advantages and disadvantages, and the disadvantages arise from the advantages. Only when there are advantages do people want to cheat. Therefore, no matter how thorough the prevention of cheating is, and how grand the theory is, there are always things that cannot be erased in reality.

Since there is a so-called Exchange Equalization Fund, there must also be those that are unequal and inaccurate, so that they can be equalized and accurate. In countries with abundant production and vast income, perhaps there is more income than expenditure, and there is no need to equalize, but when there is too much income and gold is a problem, the nine-ren palace wall is visible but unreachable, and in the end, the wealth is seen as a disaster. Moreover, there are always differences in the types of goods, uneven distribution of natural resources, and differences in supply and demand. When there is a surplus in one place and a deficit in another, there must be clearing and adjustment. Naturally, there are differences in order and differences in level. As for when there is more outflow than inflow, it is necessary to use reserves, or borrow or owe. If there is no borrowing or owing, and no maintenance, it can be allowed to grow and perish on its own, but the loss of credit is unspeakable. Therefore, even if there is a barter system, and only a small amount of products are taken to offset the debt, it is still insufficient, and people want to obtain foreign exchange. As for how foreign exchange controls affect trade, there are many precedents in various countries. If those that are inconvenient are removed, those that are suitable for one place but not for another are improved. If there is no way to improve, prevent it, ban it, and remedy it, all of which are necessary, and it should not be abandoned because of choking, and say that banning and preventing it is inappropriate.

Matters cannot be generalized, nor can they be blindly followed. Generally speaking, public affairs should be approached with a public attitude, and private opinions should not be held. Today's Shanghai exchange market involves too much, and there are a thousand holes. It is not easy to remedy. With such a complex problem, one can only start from the bigger picture and should not speak from the smaller and nearer perspective. As soon as there is personal desire, there will be concealment, and what is seen will not be clear. The foreign exchange problem is related to national policy. The so-called national policy must be able to consider both the national economy and the people's livelihood, internal and external troubles, the advantages and disadvantages, and then decide what to do and how to proceed, with a clear and impartial mind. In recent years, whenever there have been financial measures, there have been movements in the market. The country has not yet seen its benefits, and the people have not yet received its benefits. Only those speculators who are quick-eared, quick-handed, and quick-footed can take the lead, make a fortune, become rich, and have full pockets. The problems that have arisen have made rumors often become facts, and there are even more rumors in the speculative market, and more people believe them. For example, just as Mr. Fox is about to travel from Shanghai to Hong Kong, Hong Kong has a message to maintain the British exchange rate at four pence one two five. Although it can be dismissed as a rumor, the rumor is even more determined by a specific number, which is incomparable to a baseless rumor. Today's foreign exchange is difficult, from the general hardship and difficulty of life, and the credit of the legal currency, we hope for its growth. However, if there is both clever acquisition and speculative absorption, if there is no control over foreign exchange purchases, the so-called legitimate needs, even those that meet the needs of the people's livelihood, and the illegal and unnecessary needs that do not meet the needs of the people's livelihood, are all mixed together, and there is no way to distinguish them. A short fall will only help the reverse trend, and people's hearts will waver. The wind of speculation and hoarding will become more prevalent, and the panic of life will be endless. This is not a blessing for the people's livelihood, nor is it beneficial to the national economy. Therefore, to what extent should it be maintained? After Mr. Fox came to Shanghai to investigate, he must have a plan in mind. Before there is a legal expression, there is no need to speculate. However, we hope that it will be done effectively to ensure that the legitimate needs of legitimate businesses are never ignored, and that foreign exchange should be supplied as much as possible, while the buying and selling of foreign exchange by speculators, as well as the arbitrage of conspirators, should be strictly banned, and effective measures should be taken to prevent them. This is exactly what the public is eagerly looking forward to, waiting for the results of the Hong Kong meeting, not only to stabilize the current foreign exchange, but also to have a profound impact on the future legal currency, commercial prosperity and decline, and the difficulty of people's livelihood.

### The United States Will Do Its Best to Assist China, Chinese Army to Launch Counteroffensive in the Autumn, Britain and the United States Pay Attention to Defending the Yunnan-Burma Road, Foreign Minister Guo is Very Optimistic About the War

Hong Kong – According to an exclusive interview published in the Ta Kung Pao here, Chinese Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi declared, "President Roosevelt personally told me that the United States will do its best to assist us." Mr. Guo also said, "The United States will make the most of the Burma Road to transport military supplies to us. If Japan attacks Burma, the United States believes that this attack is as important as the invasion of Singapore." The British government is now paying considerable attention to the possibility of Japan invading Burma via Thailand. Mr. Guo believes that if there are sufficient defensive preparations, it will be difficult for Japan to carry out this attack, as the mountainous area along the Burmese-Thai border is the most difficult to engage in military operations. Mr. Guo announced that Britain and the United States will soon implement assistance to China to strengthen its air force strength in the future counterattack. He said, "Since the beginning of the Soviet-German war, Japan has encountered unprecedented isolation. Japan is now unable to defeat China, nor is it able to attack the Soviet Union or advance into the South China Sea. This has indirectly strengthened the strength of Britain and the United States in the region. Although Japan has threatened and intimidated, it has not achieved much in its negotiations with the Dutch East Indies. The only way for Japan to go is to increase its troops on the Chinese front, but our military strength increases with each battle. We are not afraid of Japan's final efforts, because the United States' support for China has become very certain. Chinese people here hope that they will soon be able to obtain Flying Fortresses, not only to assist the army in its large-scale counterattack, but also to bomb Japan. However, it is generally believed that these long-range bombers must be piloted by American volunteer pilots, because Chinese pilots, except for those trained in the United States, are not familiar with the complex mechanics of these giant aircraft. China is scheduled to launch a counteroffensive in the autumn, but it will depend on whether a large number of U.S. supplies arrive in the next three months and how the Burma Road, through which U.S. goods must pass, is in good condition."

Foreign Minister Guo Broadcasts to the Nation

Chongqing – Foreign Minister Guo broadcast to the nation on the Central Broadcasting Station at 7 p.m. on the 9th, entitled "International Anti-Aggression Front," which stated that when we mention international anti-aggression, we cannot help but feel a sense of pride. Four years ago, the forces of aggression began to rise, but many countries were not aware of it. Some were appeasing and tolerating, even indulging, thinking that it might be okay to compromise for a while to avoid disrupting the overall situation. Only we Chinese, under the leadership of our wise leader, recognized that aggressors would take an inch and want a mile, and that to safeguard international peace, justice, and human freedom and happiness, we could only strike the attackers at all costs. We did not covet temporary peace, nor were we limited to the so-called reality of the short-sighted, nor were we for the sake of one country or one time, harming our neighbors for our own benefit. Although we were fighting the strong with the weak, and although the powers at the time advised us to compromise and make concessions, we still raised the banner of justice and fired the shots of anti-aggression, determined not to foster enemies and leave troubles for future generations. We are the pioneers of anti-aggression, and the subsequent development of events and today's international situation prove that our understanding is absolutely correct. We can be proud to say that China is the vanguard of the anti-aggression movement in the world. In order to strengthen this hard-won international anti-aggression front so that it can fulfill its sacred mission, I would like to put forward the following two points: (1) Strengthen the organization of the front; (2) Firmly believe in victory. In these four years, we have adhered to our anti-aggression will, and have responded to all changes with the unchanging. The development of the international situation is just as we expected. All countries that love freedom and resist aggression have naturally stood on the same front. Looking back at Japan, it is becoming more and more panicked in its heart and more and more restless in its behavior. Every time it tries to take advantage of opportunities, it always ends up pleasing no one and failing in every attempt. Now we must seize this favorable opportunity, and with the warning of "halting after traveling ninety li out of a hundred," we must continue to struggle to achieve complete success. Final victory must belong to the anti-aggression side, that is, to us. But please remember that effort is the guarantee of success. (10th dispatch)

### Soviet Union Asks Britain to Launch a New Offensive Against the Nazis; Hopes to Establish a New War Zone to Achieve a Pincer Effect; and to Demonstrate its Determination and Sincerity in Aiding the Soviet Union

Reuters, Moscow, 11th. Stalin received British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, today. This is the second time in three days that he has met with the British Ambassador. The two men conferred for an hour today, with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also present. Afterwards, the British Ambassador also met with the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, for an hour and a half.

Reuters, London, 11th. According to reliable sources from Moscow yesterday, the Soviet Union has requested that Britain launch an active second front against Germany to weaken the German forces attacking the Soviet Union, and to demonstrate Britain's sincerity in assisting the Soviet Union. This request was apparently delivered by Stalin to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, as they met on Tuesday. It is also understood that the content of this request is very clear. It is reported that the Soviet Union hopes to receive not only economic and expert assistance, but also supplies of armaments and ammunition. However, Moscow hopes to establish a new battlefield to show Britain's determination and sincerity in aiding the Soviet Union, and is unwilling for Britain to rely solely on air force activities. According to reliable sources, the Soviets believe that Hitler has concentrated 80% of the German air force's strength to deal with the Soviet Union. Many of the German airmen captured by the Soviet army have been transferred from Africa, Sicily, Greece, Crete, France, Belgium, and other areas. Although the Soviet side acknowledges that many outlying strongholds have been captured by the German army, authoritative sources here confirm that the Nazis have not yet broken through the main points of the "Stalin Line," although the fighting is still taking place east of Minsk. Some believe that the Soviet troops remaining in the occupied areas are deliberately doing so to disrupt the German rear, but this is not the case. These Soviet troops are unable to break through because they are forced, but they are unwilling to surrender, so they continue to fight, thereby disrupting the German rear from time to time. Reliable sources say that the main force of the German motorized units has so far been unable to break through the Ukrainian defense line. Whenever the Soviet army is surrounded by the German army, it can still maintain contact with the main Soviet force with the help of aircraft radio and tanks. This is because there is no fixed front, so that Soviet tanks can sneak through the German lines at any time to contact the surrounded Soviet troops. Reliable sources also said that the surrounded Soviet troops often break out after fierce fighting with the German army and join the main Red Army, regardless of the loss of a large number of personnel and supplies. It is also understood that the main tactics of the Soviet air force, although directly assisting the army, are strong enough to independently carry out long-range bombing, such as bombing Konigsberg, Danzig, Warsaw, Krakow, Rogin, Ploiesti, and Constanta. Experts here with inside information declare that the reason why the German army could not break through the Minsk position, causing a large number of Nazi mechanized units to be wiped out there, is primarily due to the Red Air Force. The Soviet side also said that the German air force is unwilling to engage the Soviet air force unless absolutely necessary. The Soviet side also said that Soviet naval aircraft have repeatedly engaged German naval aircraft in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, gaining the upper hand. The Soviets admit to losing countless aircraft, and also say that although they can fight independently, if Britain and the United States can help with armaments, aircraft, ammunition, and engines, the war is expected to end sooner. According to the most reliable sources, Romanian troops are being monitored by German troops, with 60 to 100 German soldiers in each Romanian unit. German troops are equipped with machine guns in the rear to supervise the troops, forbidding the Romanian troops to retreat. Someone asked a Soviet commentator whether the Romanian troops were really fighting. The Soviet commentator replied, "They are most outstanding at surrendering."

### Important Talks Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union; Soviet Ambassador Calls on Roosevelt

Reuters, Washington, 11th. The Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Umansky, yesterday paid a courtesy visit to President Roosevelt, the first conversation in two years. After leaving the White House, he told reporters that he had informed the U.S. President of the good news of the Soviet-German war, and that all kinds of problems arising from this war, such as U.S. aid to the Soviet Union, had been discussed. He did not submit a list of Soviet needs to the President, because the U.S. government already knows very well what the Soviet Union wants to purchase in the U.S. When asked by reporters whether the Soviet-German war would last for a long time, Umansky only replied that it was a tough war. The Soviet Union is very grateful for the attitude adopted by President Roosevelt and the U.S. government towards the war against Germany, and especially admires the friendly and far-sighted attitude of the U.S. President in handling this issue. It is understood that the Soviet Ambassador's visit to the White House was at his own request. When the U.S. President received him, Assistant Secretary of State Welles was also present.

### Vichy Considers Reply to British Armistice Terms; Fighting in Syria Continues; Allied Forces Approach Beirut

Havas, Vichy, 11th. After General Dentz, Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in Syria, requested an armistice from the British forces, the British reply was forwarded here last night through the U.S. Embassy. The French government will immediately present its answer, but will never negotiate with the de Gaulle faction.

Reuters, London, 11th. According to information obtained here, the Vichy government received the British terms for an armistice in Syria in the early hours of today and is currently considering them. A reply is expected soon. Marshal Petain, General Weygand, Commander-in-Chief of Vichy forces in North Africa, and Defense Minister Huntziger conferred on the matter this morning. The cabinet also convened a meeting this afternoon. The delay in General Dentz, Vichy's Special Commissioner in Syria, replying to the armistice terms, which led to many conflicting reports in the past 24 hours, was due to the interruption of telegraphic communication within Syria. The British authorities had no choice but to telegraph the armistice terms directly to Vichy on July 9. Meanwhile, the fighting in Syria is still continuing, especially on the coastal road north of Damascus to Beirut, where fierce fighting is underway. There is no information here about the news broadcast last night by the German-controlled Paris radio station that Australian troops had entered Beirut yesterday morning. According to reports from Reuters correspondents with the army, Australian infantry patrols have advanced to the hinterland of Kelte. Australian patrols are now engaged in mopping-up operations in the mountains. The main Vichy force seems to have retreated northwards. Fighting continued north of Damascus today, and there is no sign that General Dentz is preparing to surrender. It is reported that Australian troops are now advancing on Beirut, and their patrols have reached Abe, 10 kilometers southwest of the city.

### Japanese Ambassador to Britain Arrives in Honolulu

Reuters, Honolulu, 11th. Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Mamoru Shigemitsu, arrived here yesterday on his way back to Tokyo. Shigemitsu said that he was returning to Tokyo to report, and denied that he would succeed Matsuoka as Foreign Minister. He also said that he believed he would return to London at the end of the summer. He also said that he did not want to discuss Anglo-Japanese relations in detail, but said that relations between the two countries "could be improved." Shigemitsu also said that the Japanese Embassy in London had been destroyed by bombs, but said that there were very few Japanese casualties in London.

### Soviet Union Uses Giant Tanks Weighing 120 Tons; Sharp Weapons for Charging and Breaking Through

Havas, Rome, 10th. The Evening Post recently reported that the German army had captured a giant Soviet tank, weighing 120 tons, which is probably the largest tank in the world, equipped with three large cannons and four machine guns, and driven by twelve soldiers.

### Finnish Commander-in-Chief Announces to the Troops; Prepare for Any Sacrifice, Vow to Recover Lost Territory

Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 11th. General Mannerheim yesterday issued a letter to all Finnish army soldiers stating, "In 1918, I told the Finns and Karelians that I must sheath my saber after I have obtained the liberation of Karelia. I swore an oath to the Finnish peasant army, believing that these brave men and women must prepare for any sacrifice. The new work has now begun. Karelia has formed an army and is advancing in step with the Finnish army. The hope of liberating Karelia and Greater Finland is now visible. All soldiers, the land on which you stand is stained with Finnish blood. Your victory will liberate Karelia and guarantee the future of Finland."

Havas, Stockholm, 11th. According to political observers here, Finland may sever diplomatic relations with Britain. In addition, the military order issued by General Mannerheim is not only intended to recover the eastern part of Karelia, which was ceded to the Soviet Union last March, but also to recover the land ceded to the Soviet Union under the 1920 Treaty of Tartu.

### Roosevelt Approves Army Expenses

### Encountering Strong Resistance from the Red Army, German Blitzkrieg Shows Failure; Front Line Warfare Became Quiet Yesterday; German Troops Busy Consolidating Acquired Positions

Reuters, London, 11th. According to recent news from the Eastern Front, the German offensive has been temporarily stalled. London sources believe that the German armored units have been in continuous fierce fighting for more than two weeks and must urgently need rest. It is reported that the Soviet army is holding its ground in the Ostrov area and is making a strong counterattack in the central area. The German army is now trying to build strong positions north of the Tverna River near the Pripet Marshes to protect its flanks. Since the bloody battles in the Bialystok and Minsk areas, the land warfare yesterday seemed quite quiet. The Soviet military bulletin only announced the victory of the air force, saying that there was no major battle last night, and a total of 58 German aircraft were destroyed. According to a bulletin issued by the Soviet Information Bureau, there were no large-scale battles on the entire line last night. The Soviet air force continued to bomb enemy motorized and mechanized units and raided airfields. On July 10, a total of 58 enemy aircraft were shot down, and 9 Soviet aircraft were missing. Responsible sources in Moscow all believe that the cessation of activity on all fronts is the most significant development since the start of the war, and the blitzkrieg tactics have obviously failed due to encountering strong resistance. The Soviet Union is now doing its best to mobilize its manpower and technicians to prepare for continued war. The Soviet Union's attitude can be seen in the most popular war slogan, which is "Defeat the enemy on their own territory."

Tass, Moscow, 11th. The Soviet Information Bureau issued the following war report: All day on the 9th and on the morning of the 10th, the main battles in the Pruzhany and Novograd-Volynsky areas continued. (1) In the Ostrov area, our army repelled all enemy offensives, and the enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties. (2) In the Pruzhany area, fierce fighting is also underway, and our army is carrying out a resolute counterattack. (3) As a result of the fierce fighting in the Lepel area, one enemy motorized division was completely annihilated, 40 artillery pieces and other special machinery were also destroyed. (4) In the Borisov area, one enemy division suffered heavy losses. (5) In the Bobruisk and Novograd-Volynsky areas, our army repelled the enemy offensive and strictly guarded the lines. (6) In the Bessarabia area, the enemy offensive was curbed by our strong resistance. (7) There was no fierce fighting in other areas. (8) On the 9th, our air force destroyed 100 enemy tanks.

Reuters, Moscow, 11th. Last night's official report said that the entire line from Ostrov to Bobruisk was securely defended by the Soviet army. The German offensive still seemed to be concentrated on three main lines, namely Ostrov, Borisov, and Novograd-Volynsky. Experienced external military experts do not believe in the German claims of heavy Soviet air force losses, and say that the Soviet air force is very active and effective in assisting the Red Army. This communique is unable to confirm the German claims that Ostrov has been captured. According to news from Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, the Soviet army still seems to control the city.

Reuters, London, 11th. A statement issued in Moscow last night stated that the Red Army has now established a fairly stable line on the entire front, and the recent Soviet information also has a confident tone. Therefore, commentators here with inside information are all in a quiet state of optimism. Although military observers are unwilling to be overly optimistic, they believe that if the Soviet army can continue to stop the German offensive for about two weeks and sometimes make small-scale counterattacks, their resistance can be extended for a considerable period of time. This may bring the German army to a standstill and give the Soviet army a chance to make a major counterattack later. Commentators cite three possible reasons for the German army's halt in advance, namely (1) the German army is exhausted after fighting the stubborn Soviet resistance for nearly three weeks, (2) deliberately stopping the advance to consolidate the positions it has acquired, and (3) the increase in Soviet resistance. British military experts mostly advocate the third reason, pointing out that the strategy of the Soviet high command is a policy of patience, allowing the enemy to advance to within the striking distance of its target, and then making the greatest resistance. At this critical juncture, the Soviet army will make a large-scale counterattack, but the Soviet army does not seem to intend to turn retreat into attack in the early stages of the war. If the Soviet army can limit the German army to the existing combat zone, it has already achieved its current goal, because it is believed that the German army must attack, otherwise it will admit defeat. It is believed that the German army is making the most of the relative calm to reorganize its rear lines of communication, which have obviously been destroyed by Soviet guerrillas and paratroopers.

End of the Minsk Encirclement Battle, Germany Claims Major Victory

Haitong News Agency, Führer Headquarters, 11th. The German High Command officially stated yesterday that the end of the Minsk and Bialystok double-pronged war has become the largest material encirclement battle in history. 323,898 Soviet soldiers were captured, including many commanders and division commanders. 3,332 tanks and armored vehicles, 1,809 artillery pieces, and countless other military supplies were destroyed or captured by our army. The total number of prisoners on the Eastern Front has increased to 400,000. The number of enemy tanks and armored vehicles captured or destroyed has reached 7,615, and the number of artillery pieces has reached 4,423. The loss of Soviet aircraft has reached 6,233.

Soviet Reserve Troops Complete Mobilization, Main Defense Line Unbreakable

Reuters, Vichy, 11th. French military analysts concluded yesterday that the Soviet Union has completed the emergency call-up of two major reserve armies, north and south of the "Stalin Line," and that the mobilization of millions of Soviet reserve troops is still proceeding as usual. According to information obtained by the French, the German army has launched a two-pronged attack on the "Stalin Line." The first front is in Novograd-Volynsky, where the German army's direct offensive to break through the defense line failed. The second front is in Pruzhany, north of Minsk, where the German army is trying to build six bridgeheads across the Duna River by force. In the Bessarabia area, the German army and Romanian troops have begun to try to build bridgeheads across the Dniester River in the Balta area. Analysts say that the "Stalin Line" is about 10 to 30 miles deep. As far as is known here, the German army has only broken through a certain stronghold near Bobruisk.

Soviet Guerrillas Active Everywhere, Thoroughly Implementing Scorched Earth Policy

Reuters, London, 11th. A correspondent for the Münchner Neueste Nachrichten reported from German territory in Ukraine that the Soviets in Ukraine are implementing Stalin's scorched earth policy, destroying everything as much as possible. The Soviets especially focus on destroying gas, water, electricity, and transportation. Grains have not been completely destroyed, because some have not yet matured. All the signs in Ukraine show that there have been fierce battles. The German troops have confirmed the stories of the Soviet soldiers' bravery. The German army is quite surprised by the excellent quality of the Soviet armored vehicles.

Reuters, London, 11th. Moscow Radio said that the Soviet army is implementing Stalin's scorched earth policy extremely thoroughly, so that farmers poison livestock before leaving the occupied areas. The radio station also described the activities of Soviet guerrillas behind the enemy lines on the front lines, saying that their activities are not only well-known, but also caused a Berlin correspondent for the Swedish newspaper to send out disturbing telegrams.

Havas, Moscow, 11th. The newspaper "Izvestia" published an editorial today advocating that the Soviet Union should adopt guerrilla tactics behind the German lines. It said, in part, that any citizen living in an invaded war zone should regard himself as a member of the Red Army. The predecessors of our revolutionary army should be the guides of their guerrilla units. When the enemy approaches, they should move livestock, destroy all food, and systematically destroy all kinds of roads.

### Soviet Tank Fights Ten Enemies, Minsk Soviet Commander is a Mechanical Warfare Expert

Tass, Moscow, 11th. Commander Nadin's tank stopped by the forest and found a group of enemy tanks in the road. Nadin waited until they were a little closer and shot the first enemy tank. The enemy tank's engine stopped, blocking the road. The German tank crew tried to retreat, but Nadin shot the tank in the back. Ten of the enemy's twelve tanks were surrounded by flames. Nadin and the gunner Kopytov took the opportunity to bombard the enemy. Thus, the Soviet tank defeated twelve enemies with one.

Reuters, London, 11th. General P. G. Grigorenko, the current commander of the Soviet forces in Minsk, is one of the Soviet Union's leading experts in mechanized warfare. During the Spanish Civil War, he organized and trained armored units for the Republican army. Mr. Grigorenko invented the practice of placing a number of elite soldiers on top of heavy tanks and driving them into the battlefield. These soldiers carry machine guns and hand grenades, which can greatly enhance the attacking power of tanks.

### German Army Major General Killed in Action in Finland

Reuters, Berlin, 11th. German newspapers published yesterday that Army Division Commander Major General Ottu recently died in action in Finland because he took the lead.

### Toyo Keizai Comments on the German-Soviet War Situation

Reuters, Tokyo, 11th. The "Japan Times" commented on the German-Soviet war today, saying that Germany took the initiative at the beginning of the war, using powerful methods at points between Finland and Bessarabia to establish an advantage and temporarily confuse the enemy as to the direction of the main German attack. But at this time, the Soviet command must have had the opportunity to estimate where the greatest attack force was used, and signs of Soviet resistance are now gradually appearing on the lines between the Prut River and Smolensk and Kiev. If the German side does obtain Ukraine militarily, then political movements must proceed simultaneously, with large-scale organization to make the Ukrainian peasants support national socialism. Now the whole situation is extremely complex, and politics and military affairs must complement each other, so that after the occupied land, the farmland and factories can continue their production necessary for long-term peace.

### Random Talks on the European War (68): An Impression of Paderewski

Ignace Jan Paderewski, the great Polish man and world-renowned piano virtuoso, recently passed away in New York. The following is a translation of an impression of him by a reporter from the New York Times:

Poland has always had many heroic figures, and Paderewski was no exception. He was an artist and a politician, rich in humanitarianism and patriotic fervor.

Not many days ago, he was sitting in a small parlor of a modest hotel in New York. His health was not very good, but he worked tirelessly. It is now clear that rumors of his abandoning political life due to his declining physical strength were completely unfounded. Since arriving in New York on November 6th of last year (his eightieth birthday), he had issued several appeals to Polish Americans and carried out relief work for Polish refugees. Despite the advice of close friends, he continued to work tirelessly, meticulously working within the strictly limited hours he allowed himself, unwilling to waste a single moment of energy or time. He worked an average of two hours a day, and sometimes more.

I passed through a room filled with odds and ends, but strangely, there was no piano in the room, which was disappointing. In another room, I saw Paderewski sitting upright at the table. His attire was familiar to all who had visited him or appreciated his music—a long formal coat, a soft collar, and a neatly tied bow tie. He sat there, withered and still, like an old monk in meditation, barely moving. He did not make a pointless expression, nor did he say a superfluous word. He answered all inquiries directly to the point, sometimes concisely and subtly.

His hair was paler and thinner than when I had seen him four years ago, but that was inconsequential. Since then, he had given one last performance to the New York audience, and two years ago, the New York Radio City Music Hall had broadcast his piano solo program to millions of listeners around the world. It would not be surprising if he were to regain his vigor and revive his old tunes at this moment. Moreover, people could listen to his speeches before enjoying his art.

I still remember in 1916, when the First European War was in full swing. Paderewski traveled through the various states of the United States, playing the piano and pleading for the independence and freedom of Poland. Before opening the piano and playing the magnificent scores of the great Polish composer Chopin, he delivered moving speeches with the eloquence of a politician and the majesty of a monarch of the stage. This speech, which he and his advisors and secretaries had spent a night writing, has now become a historical document. There has never been such a solemn and dramatic figure as him. His voice (previously unheard by the audience) and his gentle and firm attitude complemented each other, as if flowing out of his music.

Paderewski is still the same person as he was then, only a little older and weaker, but this does not detract from the greatness of his art and character. His greatness and humility were revealed in his conversation at all times.

I asked him, "Which is more beneficial to mankind, a great artist or a great politician?"

He could have seized the opportunity to denigrate politicians and elevate the transcendence of artists to the highest heavens. However, he was unwilling to do so. Whether a politician or an artist, a great man like him who is beneficial to the country is always indispensable.

On another occasion, I asked him if his many years of political work and musical life, which had made him famous, had fulfilled his long-cherished wish. His answer made a deep impression on me. He said, "I can only tell you: I have fought several major battles."

He continues to fight, and now he is someone who sits and watches the success or failure. His physical strength has declined and is not as strong as it was in his youth. In those years when he was the Prime Minister, one night an assassin broke into his house, holding a pistol in one hand and a letter of resignation in the other, forcing him to sign. He initially pretended to obey and pounced on the assassin suddenly, knocking the enemy's pistol to the ground. His wife, alarmed by the noise, came in to see what was happening, only to see her husband slamming the head of a stranger against the wall.

The generous and courteous Paderewski of his youth has now become a contemplative elder. He is always courteous and considerate of other people's feelings. He is not only reluctant to express himself, but he does not waste words. Sometimes, to save energy, he only speaks of a central topic, allowing his secretary, Mr. Sztralaga, to elaborate on his meaning in detail.

"You can imagine that I must advocate for Poland," he said to me calmly, "but the needs of Poland cannot be separated from the needs of the entire world, which is universally known. Totalitarianism must be overthrown, and free and autonomous governments must be restored. Unless this is realized, everything is empty talk!"

Appendix: A Chronicle of Paderewski's Life:

He held medals from the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Italy, the Polish Restoration White Eagle Medal, was elected to the French Academy, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Italian Saint Dance Cicily College, and received honorary doctorate degrees from ten famous universities such as Yale, Oxford, and Columbia.

A certain place in western Zhejiang In the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area, there have been battles between the two armies this month. Chinese guerrilla units appear and disappear unpredictably, attacking Japanese troops and destroying transportation. They planted landmines on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, overturning many Japanese vehicles, and also destroyed highways and blew up bridges, achieving great battle results. The Japanese army felt deeply threatened and recently concentrated its forces to "mop up" the Chinese army, but due to the Chinese army's elusive actions, there were no results.

### The Military Commission Released the Week's War Situation: July 4 to 10

Chongqing The situation of the war for a week (from July 4th to 10th) was discussed by the spokesperson of the Military Commission. This week coincides with the fourth anniversary of the sacred Anti-Japanese War. First of all, we should express our infinite condolences to the national heroic spirits and our infinite respect to the brave soldiers. The Japanese are now encountering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the so-called "southward advance" and "northward advance," but they are unable to move and hesitate to reach out, which is all due to the merits of the Chinese national protection heroic spirits and brave soldiers. During this week, the Japanese have tried to make various gestures, as if they were about to do something, but their feelings were all fierce and weak. Therefore, there were only small battles in various coastal areas this week, as described below.

Zhao'an

It is a small bay in the area where Min and Yue are connected. In mid-February of last year, Japan once landed and invaded, but was immediately defeated by China, and 3,000 mercenaries defected, giving Japan a major blow. This time, on the morning of the 4th, Japan gathered more than a thousand people and took several Japanese warships to forcibly land in places such as Gongkou Xun Dachen Zhailin, intending to invade Zhao'an. The Chinese army immediately resisted them in the Zhuxi Ridge, Liuli Ridge, and Fenshuiguan areas south and west of Zhao'an. By the afternoon of the 6th, the Japanese were completely repelled, killing and wounding more than 400 of them. The Japanese then retreated, occupying Huanggang City and joining the Japanese who landed from Jingzhou Slope and occupied the city, closing the city and holding on, and burning all the houses in the northeast suburbs of the city to prevent Chinese troops from pursuing the stronghold. But it was still pressed by China, and a part of the Japanese reinforcements arrived, and then turned west and invaded Qiandong Xianzhou Zhanglin and other places. The Chinese army intercepted them along the Dabeishan Lianhua. By the morning of the 8th, the Chinese and Japanese were still in a bloody battle in the area north of Zhanglin.

Fuzhou

The guerrilla teams in the four suburbs were dispatched one after another, attacking the outer strongholds of Dabeishan and other places. On the evening of the 3rd, they broke into the North Gate, killing more than 100 Japanese troops and returning. It has now been confirmed that the Japanese Yoshida Regiment Commander who was killed by China in the Battle of Dahu has been cremated in Fuzhou and a memorial service was held. The Japanese troops in Nanfuqing fell into Honglu one day, but were recaptured by the Chinese army that night, and more than 200 were killed and wounded.

Yuhuan

The Japanese army landed in Kanmen Town in the southeast at 4 a.m. one day, and the Chinese army fought bravely, killing many Japanese. By the 3rd, the Japanese were unable to hold on and escaped on warships. There are no Japanese traces on the island now.

In addition

The Chinese guerrillas along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line are unusually active and have made great achievements. On the morning of the 7th, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was destroyed in many places by China, and the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters in Nanshi, Shanghai, was also bombed by China. Japan was greatly panicked. A part of the Japanese army in Guichi, southern Anhui, invaded the southeast of the city at dawn on the 7th. Two thousand Japanese troops in Jingmen, western Hubei, also invaded the northwest of the city on the morning of the 7th and were repelled by the Chinese army. (Eleventh Telegraph)

### Linxiang Farmers Killed Japanese Soldiers

Miluo Linxiang farmers Liu Xiangwen, Tang Youlao, Liu Jinmin, etc. were farming near Majiacun a few days ago when they suddenly encountered a Japanese soldier passing by. Liu and others followed him with farm tools and took advantage of his unpreparedness to kill the Japanese soldier, seize a pistol, and submit it to the county government. The Party and government branch of this theater of war reported the matter and issued an order to commend them. (Tenth Telegraph)

### The Free World Association Sent a Telegram to Chongqing Expressing its Support

Chongqing Since Germany and Italy recognized Nanjing, the Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement received a telegram from the newly formed Free World Association from New York, USA, yesterday, saying, "We only represent the opinions of the free people of the world and express our strong support for the only legitimate government of your country," and signed by Count Sforza, the Italian Foreign Minister, Alvarez del Vayo, the former Foreign Minister of the Spanish Republican Government, Moore, the President of the American Anti-Aggression Branch, Albert, the Director of the American Aid to Britain Committee, and Street, the Secretary-General of the International Anti-Aggression Movement. According to Sforza, they are preparing to form a new international organization aimed at winning the victory of democratic countries and realizing the transformation of the world. The name of the new organization may be the Free World Association. The candidate for president has also been appointed. On our side, it is Song Ziwen, in the UK it is Sir Horsell, and in the US it is Vice President Wallace, former Secretary of State Hughes or Wilkie. (Eleventh Telegraph)

### Public Security County in Hubei Responds to the Aircraft Donation Movement

Enshi In order to respond to the one-yuan aircraft donation movement launched by the Aviation Construction Association, various agencies and groups in the Public Security County of Hubei raised 100,000 yuan for aircraft donation to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Anti-Japanese War (July 7). They donated one aircraft, and the county magistrate Fang Kuojun telegraphed the provincial government to request that it be named the "Hubei Public Security" aircraft. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government reported it to the central government for verification and rewarded him and sent back Lei to commend him in advance. (Tenth Telegraph)

### British Air Force Fiercely Attacked Italy's Southern Seaport; British Aircraft Flew into German Territory for Large-Scale Bombing; 130 Times in the 18th

Reuters, Rome, 11th The latest Italian communiqué announced that Naples, an important port and naval base in southern Germany, was attacked by British and Japanese air forces for nine consecutive nights. It was bombed by British aircraft again last night for a total of three hours. The damage to houses was heavy, with 35 dead and 33 injured.

Reuters, Cairo, 11th The British Air Force communiqué in the Middle East stated that on Wednesday, British aircraft attacked Italian seaplanes in Syracuse, Sicily. Three Italian aircraft were swept and burned, and many were heavily damaged. There were also many Italian aircraft crew casualties. British aircraft also fought with Italian aircraft in the airspace off the coast of Sicily, heavily damaging many Italian aircraft.

Associated Press, London, 11th In the 18 days since Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, the British Air Force has completed 136 consecutive attacks on the western front of Germany. The places bombed by British aircraft include the German-occupied areas of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway. Le Havre and Cherbourg are also among the places bombed. British aircraft have been bombing the above places almost day and night in order to reduce the pressure of German aircraft on the Soviet Union. British observers believe that this attack has been effective, as it has forced the German aircraft fleet to disperse its forces to pay attention to France. It is generally believed that the losses of British daytime air strikes in France are evidence that some of the best German airmen are still in France. However, the communiqué last night was very noteworthy. The communiqué stated that there had been fierce encounters in the airspace over France. In the air battle, Germany lost 13 aircraft, while Britain lost 11. The total losses of both sides in the 18th were 213 German aircraft and 192 British aircraft.

### Historical Materials on the Establishment of a Consulate in Hong Kong

— By Yi

(Our Hong Kong Correspondent) Negotiations between China and Britain for the establishment of a consulate in Hong Kong have a history of fifty years. During the late Qing Guangxu reign, there were two rounds of talks, but for various reasons, no conclusion was ever reached. It was not until the new Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi returned to China this time that a principled agreement was reached on this negotiation. After the long-pending Sino-Burmese border demarcation was concluded, the Hong Kong consulate establishment issue was resolved in conjunction, marking a new page in Sino-British diplomatic history. A Reuters dispatch from Chongqing recently stated that the first Consul-General to Hong Kong will be appointed as Mr. Diao Zuqian. The historical materials on the Hong Kong consulate establishment negotiations and a brief biography of Mr. Diao are detailed as follows:

Negotiated for Fifty Years

The negotiations for the establishment of a consulate in Hong Kong have failed to produce results for fifty years. In the past four years, the population of Hong Kong has continued to surge, increasing from over 700,000 to over one million. Over 90% of this total is Chinese, and its position in the Far East is second only to Singapore. However, for China, it is even more important than Singapore; economically, it has become an important base for China, and the center of international transportation routes, further increasing its prosperity. Therefore, the recent negotiations for the establishment of a Chinese consulate have a good chance of success, which is the main factor. Since the beginning of this year, representatives from China and Britain have been actively negotiating, and the matter has been properly discussed with the British authorities by the new Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi before leaving Britain, so it is likely to become a reality this time.

Zeng Jize's Efforts

The first representative I sent for negotiations was Mr. Zeng Jize (Duke Zeng Huimin). After several rounds of negotiations, Mr. Zeng ultimately achieved no results, because Britain was unwilling to establish a Chinese consulate, but had no reason to refuse, so it could only delay with empty words, and the result was naturally no progress, and it was aborted. Xue Fucheng's diary during his mission to England, France, Italy, and Belgium, contains the following passage:

"Duke Zeng Huimin intended to establish a consulate in Hong Kong, and sent letters several times. The British Foreign Office used the excuse of consulting the colonial department, and the colonial department used the argument that it was inconvenient for officials and civilians, but no agreement was reached after much pleading."

Xue Fucheng's Arguments

Subsequently, Mr. Xue Fucheng also exerted efforts to negotiate, because Mr. Xue was then an imperial envoy to England, France, Italy, and Belgium, and was an appropriate person to participate in the matter. What initially drew his attention to the establishment of a consulate in Hong Kong was the memorandum from the Zongli Yamen (the highest foreign affairs agency in the Qing Dynasty) on May 14th, Guangxu 16th year (1890), asking him to discuss with the British Foreign Office the establishment of Chinese consulates on British-owned islands near Singapore. Therefore, he thought of the importance of establishing a consulate in Hong Kong, and decided on a negotiation method. He believed that "establishing one place and negotiating one place, piece by piece, would only waste words, and it would be difficult to be sure of success." But what method could achieve this goal? Thus, "English Secretary Magery (Qing Chen) suggested first issuing a diplomatic note to the Foreign Office, citing public law and the usual practice of various countries, stating that China could send consuls to reside in British territories, without specifying where for the time being, and that Japan and Siam already had consuls in Hong Kong, but they alone firmly rejected China, which was unfair. Now, if we only discuss the general principles of common practice, they will have no excuse to reject us. Once they agree, then we can appoint consuls wherever we want." Mr. Xue thought it was appropriate, so he asked Secretary Ma to draft an English note, and sent it to the British Foreign Office on August 13th, Guangxu 16th year. The reasons stated inside were:

(1) "Although China has not yet allowed Westerners to trade in all parts of the interior, even from what China has done, it is enough for China to ask for permission to establish consuls in British territories, so China hopes that Britain will allow it to send consuls to reside in British territories, and handle matters in the same way as it allows consuls of other friendly countries to reside."

(2) "China has over twenty places where foreign people are allowed to reside and trade, and the taxes levied are lighter than those in other countries with treaties. Britain has sent consuls to reside in these twenty-one places."

(3) "In 1878, when your lordship drafted the note, the Yantai Treaty had not yet been ratified, but it already stated that China had the right to send consuls to British territories; also, in the treaty of October 24th, 1860, it was clearly stated that Britain was willing to recognize China's right to send consuls to various parts of Britain; although this treaty has not been followed... the British government had already intended to allow the establishment of Chinese consulates."

On the 16th, Mr. Xue sent Secretary Ma Qingchen to the British Foreign Office to inquire about the establishment of consulates on the various islands in the South Seas. According to Qingchen's conversation with Vice-Secretary Sandersen, it can be analyzed as follows:

Sandersen's opinion: (1) "The Sino-British treaty has no explicit provision for China to establish consulates in British territory, so there have been many obstacles in the past when discussing this matter"; (2) "Hong Kong is close to Guangdong, and is entirely inhabited by Chinese, so if Chinese officials are established there, it is inevitable that they will overshadow the British"; (3) "China's customs are just beginning to open up, and it is feared that the consuls will not know their duties, and will engage in infringing on rights and overstepping boundaries."

Qingchen's opinion: (1) "The treaty has an explicit provision for Britain to establish consulates in China, and this should be applied equally. If everything had to be written in detail, the treaty would be too cumbersome"; (2) "Japan and Siam already have consuls in Hong Kong, but China alone is not allowed, which is difficult to explain. What cannot be explained in terms of reason cannot be done in terms of power"; (3) "Consul Zuo Binglong in Singapore... is familiar with Chinese and foreign affairs, and handles matters appropriately, without any complaints from near or far. If a Chinese consulate is established in Hong Kong, it is said that Zuo Binglong will be transferred there to start everything, and it will definitely be done according to law."

The focus of this negotiation was twofold: one was the establishment of consulates on various islands near Singapore, and the establishment of a Consul-General in Singapore to oversee them, which was the intention of the Zongli Yamen; the other was the establishment of a consulate in Hong Kong, which was Mr. Xue's intention, and was the focus of this negotiation.

Later, on October 19th, the British Foreign Office's note was received, the original text is as follows:

"To the matter of issuing a note, this Lordship's department has received Your Excellency's letter of September 23rd, stating:

The Chinese court wishes to send consuls to reside in British territory, etc. This matter has been carefully considered by the British government, and now this Lordship's department is very pleased to inform Your Excellency that the British government is willing to give credentials to the consuls sent by China, and handle matters in the same way as it gives to the consuls of other foreign friendly countries, but there are places where the circumstances of the place need to be considered, and there may be places where credentials cannot be given for the time being. This needs to be decided by the British government after examining the circumstances. Correspondingly issuing this note to Your Excellency, please bother to check it, it must be to the note, November 29th, 1890, issued from the Foreign Office."

The place referred to here as a place where "the circumstances of the place need to be considered" refers to New Gold Mountain, not Hong Kong. Therefore, on the 20th, Mr. Xue "replied to the Foreign Office, praising its fairness in handling matters, and informing it that the Chinese consuls to be sent should first be in Hong Kong and near Singapore, and that two officials have now been selected, pending approval by the Zongli Yamen. These two officials are experienced, knowledgeable, discreet, and peaceful, and are certainly competent. The one to be stationed in Hong Kong is planned to be Zuo Binglong, the Consul in Singapore, and the one to be stationed in Singapore is planned to be Huang Zunxian, the Second Secretary of the Embassy, not only as Consul in Singapore, but also as Consul in Penang, Malacca, and nearby places. As for the Deputy Consuls to be selected for Penang and other places, they will be reported after they have been reviewed and approved."

A few days later, the British "Foreign Office issued a note, saying that it had been received and that there were no objections." Mr. Xue believed that "the overall situation has been settled."

In summary, the fundamental reason why Mr. Xue sought the establishment of a consulate in Hong Kong at that time was that "Hong Kong is a vital hub for Sino-foreign communication. All Chinese and foreign goods first arrive in Hong Kong, and then are transshipped to various provinces. The most important issues for negotiation are (1) escaped criminals, (2) smuggling, and (3) maritime boundaries. Whenever there is a major case in Guangdong Province, officials are sent to Hong Kong, but because there is no consulate, their voices are cut off, and there are many obstacles. The addition of a consulate here cannot be delayed."

As for the establishment of a Hong Kong consulate, which was "settled overall," history tells us that it became a bubble.

In recent years, a new China has been established. Thanks to the continuous assistance from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, diplomatic relations have become unprecedentedly cordial. At this time, Hong Kong has become a center of China's international transportation routes, and the population has increased to over one million, of which over 90% are Chinese. The establishment of a Chinese consulate in Hong Kong is urgently needed, and Britain also feels that China no longer needs to be suspected too much. Sino-British relations have become closer day by day, so after much negotiation, especially before the new Minister Guo Taiqi left Britain, he discussed the matter with the British authorities, and there has been progress. Moreover, the consular organization has been planned as one Consul-General, one Vice-Consul, and four Consuls.

This newspaper recently received a letter from the owner of Mianxingxuan, saying that he reads your newspaper's commercial news every day, and is satisfied with all economic data, but recently the foreign currency market quotations published in your newspaper are extremely inaccurate for the buying and selling quotations of British and American gold pounds. At first, I thought it was a temporary error, and it would be corrected the next day, but it is like this today, and it is like this again tomorrow, which is deeply regrettable. Check the market quotations of the 7th, the British pound buying price is 185 yuan, the buying price is 180 yuan, the US gold pound selling price is 188 yuan, the buying price is 183 yuan, the difference between the buying and selling price is nine yuan, check that most of the collectors of this gold pound are women, they only know to buy based on the newspaper's report, if someone goes to a small money shop to buy, they will definitely say that there is no stock, but if they sell it, they will close the deal according to the market price in your newspaper, such a trace becomes fraud, please your newspaper investigate it for luck,

After receiving this letter, this newspaper immediately sent it to the foreign currency market quotation interviewer for reply, and now the reply letter is transcribed to answer the owner of Mianxingxuan and to inform the readers, roughly saying that regarding the exchange rate issue of British and American gold pounds, the following is explained, the British pound has always been based on the weight of 23387, to the closing price of the shabu red on that day (such as today's closing price is 6623.00) plus the cash premium of 290.00, two total 6913, to 6913.00x23387, the number obtained is 162 yuan, but because the amount of cash pounds in circulation is very small, so the market often raises, roughly raising the above price by four or five yuan, that is, each pound is 166 or 7 yuan, this is the actual formal market quotation, recently because small peers hoard goods for speculation, often do as high as 170 odd yuan, (but there is absolutely no market quotation outside of 180 yuan), the above wild market, I am unwilling to report and publish it, but since there are readers who come to question, I have to publish it according to the wild market,

### Piece Goods: Eastern Fine Cloth Plunges, Futures Down About Two Yuan

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market was affected by the sharp drop in Eastern piece goods, with fine cloth twills bearing the brunt of the impact. Sales suffered a significant setback, with fine cloth and fine twills falling by five to seven and a half jiao per piece. Some coarse cloth and coarse twills fell by two and a half jiao, while the remaining stocks remained stable. Bleached cloth and colored cloth also decreased by about five jiao. Over three hundred pieces of various cloths were transacted on this street. Buyers were in a wait-and-see mood. Cantonese, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian buyers purchased over two hundred pieces of bleached and dyed cloth. Shandong buyers purchased fifty to sixty pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth. Today, two hundred pieces of cotton cloth are being shipped to Yantai.

Eastern Cloth: As yarn prices continue to fall, short sellers in the exchange seized the opportunity to aggressively sell, causing a fierce downward trend. Prices plummeted in a straight line during both morning and afternoon sessions. Fine cloth futures for distant months fell by as much as two yuan. The spot market also followed suit, but mid-range fine cloth and fine twills fared better due to acceptable sales on this street, falling by only seven and a half to one yuan per piece. The closing price for Longtou fine cloth factory orders was forty-seven yuan and six jiao, down one yuan and two jiao. Sijunzi drill closed at one yuan, five jiao, eight fen, two li and a half, down two fen and seventy-five. It is noted that major players in the industry are holding firm, so although prices have fallen, the market remains tight.

Grain: Rice Stocks Steadily Increasing, Rice Prices Further Reduced, But Still Hoping for War

Yesterday's foreign rice market formed a fluctuating pattern. The morning market was flat and lacked positive signs, but soon selling pressure surged, leading to a sharp decline. This was because publicly investigated warehouse stocks of rice had increased dramatically due to continuous arrivals. Yesterday, the published figure reached 2,173,468 bags. The quantity held by shops and food households was also substantial, and the volume of publicly sold rice awaiting sale was considerable. Pricing gradually decreased, and further reductions were possible. As a result, many scattered sellers emerged, and prices for all current-term rice fell across the board. Xiaowen for July, which opened at one hundred and fifty-three yuan yesterday, fell to one hundred and fifty yuan. Dafu Yuangen Xiaozhi fell to one hundred and fifty yuan and five jiao. Other grades, such as Siamese futures No. 2 and various grades of spot rice, fell by varying amounts ranging from one yuan to two and a half yuan. However, this decline triggered inquiries from scalpers, and buying groups took advantage of the lower prices to make purchases. Subsequently, rumors spread throughout the market, all favorable to long positions. Speculators suddenly became excited, and July Xiaojiao rose from one hundred and fifty-one yuan, one yuan and a half, two yuan, two yuan and three jiao, to one hundred and fifty-two yuan and a half. Market prices immediately increased by two yuan. Current Xiaowen Yinghua Company was priced at one hundred and fifty yuan and eight jiao. Erqu Siamese rose from one hundred and forty-two yuan, three yuan and a half, to one hundred and forty-four yuan, ultimately closing only a few jiao higher than the previous close. Spot rice also recovered from its lows, ultimately closing only a few jiao to one yuan higher. Total daily transactions included fifteen to sixteen hundred tons for Yinghua Company and sixteen to seventeen thousand bags of spot rice. The closing price for high-quality Saigon No. 1 was one hundred and thirty-one yuan and a half, one hundred and thirty-one yuan, Zhongguan one hundred and twenty yuan and two jiao, one hundred and twenty-eight yuan and three jiao, No. 2 one hundred and twenty-three yuan and five jiao, one hundred and twenty-three yuan, small bags one hundred and seventeen or eighteen yuan, Siamese No. 2 one hundred and twenty-one yuan and a half, Mindang one hundred and thirty-three yuan, Ruofo rice one hundred and twenty-seven or eight yuan, Annam glutinous rice one hundred and thirty-three yuan, Tokyo polished tip one hundred and fifteen yuan and eight jiao, broken tip ninety-eight yuan to ninety-six yuan, No. 2 broken ninety-one yuan.

The Arrival of Thick and Thin Japonica Rice Continues to be Strong, but Sales are Slow, Continuing to Present an Uneven Supply and Demand Situation. Market Conditions are Difficult to Maintain, and Prices for Both Thick and Thin Japonica Rice Have Fallen Again by One Yuan Per Stone. Early and Late Season Fresh Rice from Kainan Port is Priced at One Hundred and Forty-Two Yuan to One Hundred and Forty Yuan, Wuxi Original Bag White Japonica Rice at One Hundred and Thirty-Five Yuan, Old Rice at One Hundred and Thirty-Two or Three Yuan.

Glutinous Rice: Due to Continued Weakness in Foreign Rice, Sales of Both Domestic and Foreign Glutinous Rice are Stagnant. Although Lenders See Scarce Goods and Still Attempt to Persist, They Ultimately Find it Difficult to Succeed. As a Result, Prices are Weak Across the Board, with Prices Falling by About One Yuan. Hong Kong White Yuan is Priced at One Hundred and Twenty-Four Yuan, Ultimately Falling to One Hundred and Twenty-One Yuan, Jindan Domestic Yuan One Hundred and Twenty-Seven Yuan to One Hundred and Twenty-Five Yuan, Glutinous Lv is Not Seen to be Opening.

Today, 1,500 Bags of Corn will be Loaded onto the Taikoo Company's New Beijing Ship for Shipment to Yantai.

Flour Market Initially Weak, Then Firm

Yesterday's spot flour market was initially weak, then firm. The morning market opened weakly due to sluggish actual sales. Jinlong flour opened at only thirty-two yuan and six jiao, and Paotai flour at thirty-three yuan and six jiao. However, favorable news soon emerged, and rumors of a firmer rice market improved sentiment. Local buyers and speculators successively purchased. Jinlong flour rose from thirty-two yuan and six jiao to seven, eight, nine jiao, then twenty-three yuan and one jiao. Paotai flour also increased by two jiao to thirty-three yuan and eight jiao. As a result, it closed one or two jiao firmer than the previous day. Zhonglou brand also traded above thirty-four yuan, and Chiyan brand at thirty-three yuan, both reported stable. Fifteen to sixteen thousand bags were transacted. Market fundamentals remain hidden.

New Wheat Supply Remains Severed, and the Japanese Factory Retail Price is Still Limited to Forty Yuan, Which is Not in Line with Production Costs. Therefore, Operators are Mostly Watching. Foreign Wheat Flour Shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai, the Taikoo Company's Hanyang Ship Arrived the Day Before Yesterday, in Addition to Loading Foreign Rice for the Public Works Department, Also Shipped 5,600 Bags of Wheat Flour from Hong Kong, Which Has Been Unloaded.

Miscellaneous Grains: Mung Beans are Stagnant, Prices Fall, Bean Cakes Fill Shorts, Reversing Market Trends

Tea Beans: This Year, Due to High Prices and Stagnant Sales, Local Demand is Significantly Lower Than in the Past, Which is Quite Unexpected by Stockholders. As a Result, Market Momentum is Soft and Difficult to Revive.

### Coal: Xiaoziting Coal is Scarce

--Price increased by ten yuan--

Hongji No. 1 Xiaoziting coal, in recent months, due to the suspension of sales by a certain foreign firm in the French Concession, only Tong Coal is available, making pure Xiaoziting coal a rare commodity in the market. A certain firm has increased the price by ten yuan on fellow traders, from four hundred and twenty yuan to four hundred and thirty yuan. However, lump coal prices remain unchanged in the open market, but are slightly firmer in the informal market, as foreign exchange rates have tightened recently, and stockholders are resuming absorption. Sales of firewood remain flat.

### Sassoon Discusses Far East Situation: US and Japan Unlikely to Go to War, Japan Taking Cautious Steps Towards the US, Hitler Actively Trying to Induce Japan to Fight

Sir Victor Sassoon, a leading figure in the city's financial circles, returned here on the President Pierce steamer the day before yesterday (10th) after being away from Shanghai for several months. Yesterday (11th) morning, he told the press that the United States and Britain should concentrate their land and sea forces to fight Hitler's totalitarianism. He believed that the United States, while linked to South America, could not guarantee its security, as the North and South American continents have no common economic ground. If Britain were to lose, South America would be entirely within the Nazi sphere of influence. For the connection between North and South America to succeed, Britain must win.

The Soviet Union Will Not Be Defeated by Germany: Currently, the power of isolationists in the United States has diminished compared to before. Isolationists certainly do not want war, but they are even more disgusted with Hitler. Very few want to see Hitler control the United States, and their opinions are insignificant. Sassoon continued, "I am currently not sympathetic to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is a totalitarian state and has also broken promises and torn up treaties when it suited itself. However, I do not believe that the Soviet Union will be defeated by Germany, as the Soviet Union has a large area and can continue to resist, just like China."

Hitler Intends to Use Japan: Sassoon also said, "I do not believe that the United States and Japan are likely to go to war, as the Japanese government is taking cautious steps towards the United States and knows that if Germany defeats the Soviet Union and becomes Japan's neighbor, Japan may ally with the United States. Hitler urgently needs Japan's navy and is willing to give Japan any promises it requests, whether it be the Dutch East Indies, Australia, India, or Vietnam. Hitler is willing to allow Japan to set foot, just asking Japan to assist with the navy in return."

If Successful, He Will Invade Japan Again: But if Hitler succeeds in defeating the United States, he will turn to Japan. He believes that Japan is not being fooled by Hitler and that Japan is only making treaties with Germany because it suits itself at the moment. Last December, he knew that Soviet-German relations would break down, and the Japanese government had received intelligence that the Soviet-German split would occur in August or September. Unexpectedly, Hitler changed his plans again, and the split with the Soviet Union was even faster than everyone expected.

Four Days on the Shanghai-Nanjing Road

Damaged Tracks Have Been Repaired, Destroyed Vehicles Piled by the Roadside

Along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways, Chinese guerrillas have been unusually active since the 7th of this month. The work of demolishing tracks and laying mines has been discovered everywhere, causing trains to be bombed in many places and frequently interrupted, causing great inconvenience to passengers. Until the day before yesterday (Thursday), the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway had two sections of track destroyed between Longtan and Gaozi. Between Danyang and Lingkou, near Lujiabang Tianfu Temple in Kunshan, two landmines exploded. On the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, a landmine exploded between Linban Xucun. At 9:30 AM on the 10th, the Tianma Express train from Nanjing to Shanghai was bombed again between Qixia Mountain and Longtan. There were six incidents in four days. All the damaged tracks have now been completely repaired, so traffic has resumed as usual yesterday. However, some of the destroyed vehicles are still piled by the roadside.

### President Pierce Steamer Bids Farewell to Shanghai: Sailed Directly Back to the US Last Night, Japan Cancels Port Calls Along the Way, Future US Ships to Shanghai Will Be Irregular

The American President Lines' President Pierce steamer arrived in Shanghai around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (10th), berthed at floating docks 12 and 13.

In addition to those disembarking in this city, there are about 200 passengers on the original ship returning to the US via Shanghai. There are also 120 passengers from this city taking the ship to the US. The company has no ships coming to Shanghai this month. Next month, one ship will come from the US to Shanghai, heading to Hong Kong and Luzon. One ship will return from Luzon via Hong Kong to Shanghai. The date must be in the latter half of next month.

### German Women and Children in Dutch East Indies Take Refuge in German School, Cared for by the German Embassy and Consulate, The Remaining 400-Plus People Go to Japan on the Original Ship

The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that 666 German women and children residing in the Dutch East Indies were released from detention camps and arrived here yesterday (10th) on the Japanese mail ship Asama Maru. 199 of them have disembarked in Shanghai and are now staying at the German school on Avenue Haig. 70 of them will travel from Shanghai to Tianjin, Qingdao, and Beiping, while the rest will stay in Shanghai and be cared for by the German embassy and consulate in this city. The remaining 467 people will continue on the Asama Maru to Nagasaki, Kobe, and Yokohama in Japan, where they will also be cared for by German expatriates. A reporter visited the Asama Maru and interviewed the German women. According to them, they were given bread and canned meat in the detention camps in the Dutch East Indies. Their husbands, sons, or brothers, being able-bodied men, were still detained in the Dutch East Indies detention camps and would not be released until the end of the war. Some German women complained about the poor food in the detention camps, but they were all quite happy and not haggard. It is said that this was due to the excellent food and drink on the ship for the past eleven days. They have no definite plans for the future and can only eagerly await the end of the war.

As The Last of The Regular Ships: The Shanghai Times reported that the US mail ship President Pierce arrived in Shanghai yesterday (10th) afternoon from South China and is scheduled to set sail for the US tonight (11th). The President Pierce is the last of the regular US mail ships currently passing through Shanghai. Industry sources say that other US mail ships may soon sail to Shanghai, such as four Danish ships that have been requisitioned in the Philippines and will replace the US President Lines' ships on Far Eastern routes. However, these ships will not sail on a regular schedule. Since the US President Lines' Pacific passenger ships have been fully requisitioned by the US government, the President Pierce, which is leaving tonight, has become the last regular ship leaving Shanghai. There are a large number of passengers boarding the ship in Shanghai, a rare sight since the American expatriates received evacuation orders and returned to their country in droves.

Mr. Bredsdorff Also Left Shanghai Yesterday: Mr. Bredsdorff, President of the Shanghai Branch of the American Red Cross and Chairman of the British American Tobacco Company, retired at an advanced age and left Shanghai on the President Pierce last night with his family to return to the US, where he will settle in Seattle and spend his remaining years. Among those who went to the wharf last night to see him off were Dr. Garder Means, Vice President of the Red Cross, US Consul-General Lockhart, and Chinese and Western friends in Shanghai. He shook hands with each of those who saw him off, and could not help but feel sad at the abrupt departure from his second hometown of China.

Izumo Docks at Zhongzhan Wharf

The Japanese Navy's Third Fleet flagship Izumo, which left Shanghai on the 26th of last month to patrol, returned to Shanghai around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday (10th) and docked at the China Merchants Bureau East Dock in Pudong, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Izumo moved to the original China Merchants Bureau Zhongzhan Wharf yesterday morning.

Shanghai Manufacturers Will Go to India to Investigate the Yarn Industry, Forming an Investigation Group

Bombay, India, is one of the world's textile industry centers, almost as famous as Manchester, England. However, due to the European War, production rates have been reduced. Manufacturers in this city will unite with manufacturers staying in Hong Kong to form an investigation group to go to that place to investigate in order to develop Sino-Indian trade.

Forming an Investigation Group: Sino-Indian trade has seen great progress this year. Recently, due to the expansion of the European War, the place is even more welcoming of Shanghai products. Sales of cotton yarn, cloth, towels, and knitwear are increasingly strong. In order to promote trade, manufacturers are preparing to form an investigation group to go to Bombay, India, to investigate the yarn industry and study the working equipment status of the yarn factories there, as well as the production and sales situation, as a reference. They will conveniently go to various ports in Southeast Asia to visit and further contact manufacturers in various places to strengthen the sales organization. It has not yet been decided whether we will unite with those in the Hong Kong industrial community or only have manufacturers staying in Hong Kong conveniently go there.

Strong Sales in the South: Recently, the south sales of domestic yarn, cloth, towels, etc. in this city have suddenly become strong. In addition to a part being sold internally from Hong Kong via Guangzhou Bay and other places, the rest is resold to India, Myanmar, Borneo, the Philippines, and various ports in Southeast Asia. The Yuezhou ship the day before yesterday, the Mingsheng ship yesterday, and the Hanli ship, etc., all had large quantities of cotton yarn, cloth, towels, and socks transported to Hong Kong. Mr. Fox, the American member of the Equalization Fund Committee, and his assistant Mr. Taylor, came to Shanghai to inspect financial foreign exchange and completed their trip. They left Shanghai on the Yihong Mingsheng ship for Hong Kong the day before yesterday afternoon. They will discuss with the committees who have just arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing the stabilization of foreign exchange and other strategies. Mr. Fox will also contribute the results of his inspection to the Equalization Committee for reference. Once a concrete plan for stabilizing the statutory foreign exchange and maintaining the Black Mountain exchange rate is discussed and decided in Hong Kong, it will be implemented immediately. However, it can be asserted that the Shanghai Black Mountain exchange rate will continue to be maintained to safeguard the interests of legitimate merchants, but effective measures will be taken to eliminate speculative activities and the arbitrage of conspirators.

Maintaining Methods Kept Secret: A Reporter Learned from Banking Circles Yesterday that Mr. Fox's Trip to Shanghai, What are His Observations and What are His Plans? Outsiders Have No Way to Guess. However, the Shanghai Market has Paid Attention to and Discussed the Traces of Mr. Fox Everywhere. The General Public Speculated About Maintaining the Black Market and Eliminating Speculative Measures, and No Conclusion Could Be Reached. However, Banking Leaders Concerned with Foreign Exchange Also Kept Their Mouths Shut. But How to Rate the Level of Black Market Foreign Exchange is Also Impossible to Know. Because if the Maintaining Method Leaks, it Will Have a Significant Impact on the Financial Market and Create Opportunities for Speculators. In the Future, When There are Foreign Exchange Fluctuations in the Shanghai Market, the Equalization Association Will Maintain and Adopt the Entrustment Method, Which Will Never Be Publicly Disclosed.

Free Areas Have Been Unified: Regarding the foreign exchange of the Free Areas, it has been completely unified. The statutory exchange rate announced by the Central Bank every day remains the same and has never changed. For the import of necessities for legitimate merchants, those approved by the government are provided with foreign exchange by the Bank of China and the Communications Bank as much as possible, but applicants must pay a balancing fee equal to the difference between the legal price and the quoted price of the Bank of China and the Communications Bank. As for the export of major native products, those stipulated to settle foreign exchange are entitled to receive the difference between the legal price and the quoted price of the settling bank from the settling bank after the actual settlement amount is cleared. As for luxury goods such as foreign wine, orders have long been issued to prohibit imports.

Restricting the Supply of Consumables: Due to the Temporary Inability of the Government's Power in the Isolated Island of Shanghai Trade, Goods Prohibited from Import by the Government, Such as Luxury Goods Like Foreign Wine and Cigarettes, and Semi-Luxury Goods, Can Still be Freely Imported, and the Activities of Foreign Exchange Black Market Speculators Still Exist. It is Heard that Mr. Fox Believes it is Necessary to Control the Huge Consumption of These Luxury Goods. Therefore, He Proposes to Impose Appropriate Restrictions on the Foreign Exchange Required for the Import of Luxury Goods, Aiming to Reduce the Import of Worthless Goods, so that China's Foreign Trade Will Not Be Against the Trend. Maintaining the Balance of International Payments is the Essence of the Economic Policy of Any Country.

The position of Shanghai quarantine director is occupied by the Japanese side. As for the four quarantine boats Yue Fei, Mulan, Hua Tuo, and Cai E, all of which belonged to the quarantine office, were seized by the Japanese side at that time. Up to now, only Mulan and Hua Tuo have been returned to the customs for use.

Tides Have Been Quite High for Several Days

The tides in the Huangpu River have been high for several days, with levels around eleven feet. Low-lying roads have had high tides gushing out of the sewers in the afternoon two or three hours. Fortunately, there are no strong winds or rain, or else the tide would overflow from the Bund embankment onto the road surface. At the same time, cases of epidemic diseases have surged, and there have been many cases of heatstroke.

### Adopt Fair and Effective Measures to Maintain Exchange Rates in Shanghai, Those Who Speculate and Profit Will Be Crushed, Restrictions Will be Added to The Settlement of Foreign Exchange for Luxury Goods

Mr. Fox, the American member of the Equalization Fund Committee, and his assistant Mr. Taylor, came to Shanghai to inspect financial foreign exchange and completed their trip. They left Shanghai on the Yihong Mingsheng ship for Hong Kong the day before yesterday afternoon. They will discuss with the committees who have just arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing the stabilization of foreign exchange and other strategies. Mr. Fox will also contribute the results of his inspection to the Equalization Committee for reference. Once a concrete plan for stabilizing the statutory foreign exchange is discussed and decided in Hong Kong, it will be implemented immediately. However, it can be asserted that the Shanghai Black Mountain exchange rate will continue to be maintained to safeguard the interests of legitimate merchants, but effective measures will be taken to eliminate speculative activities and the arbitrage of conspirators.

### Guangdong Steamer Loaded with Machinery: Japanese Forcibly Ordered Unloading Ashore; British Consulate General Seriously Intervened, Expected to be Resolved; Rumor Says Dutch Consulate Lodged Protest, Japanese Side Enraged

The British-owned Taikoo Company's Guangdong steamer, which departed from Shanghai at noon the day before yesterday (the 10th) bound for Singapore and Rangoon, was carrying several pieces of machinery belonging to the Andersen, Meyer & Co., which the Japanese side mistakenly believed to be the property of the Chinese government. The Japanese navy at Wusong ordered the Guangdong steamer to return and dock at the Donggou Rongpu Bureau Wharf and dispatched troops to monitor it. This matter was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that regarding the Guangdong steamer incident, although various parties are negotiating, there was no progress yesterday. It is reported that the Japanese side firmly insisted that the machinery be removed before the steamer could be released. Therefore, a definitive solution is expected today.

#### Japanese Claim Captain Has Agreed to Unload Ashore

The English-language "North-China Daily News" reported that the Taikoo Company's "Guangdong" steamer left Shanghai southward with machinery yesterday (the 10th) afternoon. It was suddenly detained by the Japanese army outside Wusong. According to Japanese sources, the captain of the Guangdong has agreed to unload the machinery ashore at 10:00 a.m. this morning (the 11th) for inspection by the Japanese.

#### Machinery Originally Stored in the Bank of China

According to a Japanese army spokesperson, the Guangdong was intercepted because it was carrying 500 boxes of machinery previously stored in the Bank of China in Shanghai. This machinery was entrusted to Andersen, Meyer & Co. to be transported from Shanghai to the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese authorities suspected that it was the property of Chongqing and intercepted the steamer for inspection. The captain of the Guangdong unloaded the machinery at Wusong this morning after being detained for several hours outside Wusong and continued southward. This statement has not been confirmed by Andersen, Meyer & Co. or Taikoo Company, as both companies have remained silent on the matter.

#### British and Japanese Consuls General Consulted Yesterday

It is reported that the British and Japanese Consuls General in Shanghai consulted yesterday morning on the Guangdong steamer detention. It is also rumored that a representative from the Dutch Consulate General in Shanghai lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities regarding the detention of the machinery, but the Japanese side did not accept it. The Dutch authorities also remained silent when reporters inquired.

#### Sunspots Disappear, Communications Return to Normal

Several days ago, transoceanic radio communications suddenly experienced interference, disrupting some overseas news. The cause was found to be sunspots, which caused magnetic storms that interfered with communications. Magnetic storms often coincide with disruptions in telephone and telegraph services. At their strongest, they can even completely disrupt transportation (electricity) tools. These phenomena are related to solar activity. The bright disturbances around sunspots are the most active areas, and because they are composed of gases, they can erupt suddenly within minutes. The same situation occurred in the second half of last year but soon disappeared and returned to normal. This past Monday, two sunspots appeared on the left and right sides of the sun, causing slight interference to radio and telephone communications for the past few days. It is now learned that they have gradually disappeared and returned to normal.

#### Shanghai Foreign Dance Halls, Bars, etc., to Form a Federation

Owners of foreign dance halls, bars, and nightclubs in Shanghai will hold a meeting on the 16th of this month at the DD Bar on Avenue Joffre to establish a federation for mutual assistance and protection. According to a bar owner, the purpose of the federation is to prevent employees from breaking contracts and going on strike, and to prevent speculation by foreign firms and liquor and other beverage merchants, in order to safeguard their own interests. A preparatory committee was formed at the first meeting on July 8th, with Mr. Yu as chairman and Mr. Bailey as vice-chairman.

#### General Manager of Reuter's Returns to Shanghai

Mr. Mesis, Far East General Manager of Reuter's News Agency in Shanghai, has returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing his official visit to the Reuter's branch offices in Japan, Indochina, and Thailand last month.

### Western Newspaper Reports CCP Manifesto: Implementing Democratic Governance, Loyal to the "Nation First" Concept, Uniting All Parties and Factions to Resist Aggression

The "North-China Daily News" reports that CCP members in the border provinces of China are currently preparing for general elections and are following war strategies to unite all classes and parties to resist aggression and develop the concept of "Nation First." Rumors to the contrary are self-defeating. The CCP is sincerely loyal to the "Nation First" concept and therefore implements democratic governance in the administrative system without practicing communism. It protects private property and ownership and welcomes external participation, and foreign clergy are also very welcome. The aforementioned CCP procedures are contained in an English translation of a manifesto received by the editorial department of the "North-China Daily News." The manifesto is entitled "CCP Political Program for the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region" and was published in preparation for the general election in the border region. It is said that very few outsiders have obtained this manifesto.

#### Unite All Parties to Defend China

It contains the CCP's 21-point program, which will be vigorously implemented in the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. This political program was "approved" by the CCP Central Political Bureau on May 1st of this year. The first point is to "unite all classes and parties loyal to the national war effort to mobilize and utilize all manpower, funds, and natural resources to defend mainland China, the Northwest, and the border regions, and to repel the violence of the invaders."

#### Protect Private Property and Vigorously Implement Democracy

The second point refers to the protection of private property and the freedom of external investment, trade, and industrial development. The manifesto also emphasizes "promoting a cooperative election system with all parties and popular organizations," stating that "if CCP members are elected to important positions in administrative organs, the CCP guarantees that two-thirds of the personnel in the administrative organs will be non-CCP members, and will implement extremely strict parliamentary democratic regulations."

#### Truly Implement the Three Principles of the People

In addition, the religious beliefs and customs of the Hui people must be respected, and the "Regulations on the Protection of Property Rights in Counties East of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway" have been implemented, which proves that the CCP is indeed implementing the Three Principles of the People and maintaining the United Front.

#### Black Market Car Robbed in Front of the Nanjing Theater

At around 11 p.m. last night, in front of the Nanjing Theater on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, a black market car (license number 7605) was suddenly approached by two bandits, each wielding a handgun. They forcibly drove the car away, and its whereabouts are unknown. Whether there were any passengers in the car and what the car was used for are still under investigation by the police authorities.

### Public Works Department Staff Allowances: Implemented Periodic Adjustments; Allowance Amounts Determined Based on the Cost of Living Index; Indeed Sufficient to Stimulate Prices and Affect All Industries

The case of the Public Works Department providing a general allowance increase to its staff was recommended by the Selection Committee last month and approved by the authorities, retroactive to May 1st. A temporary measure for increasing staff allowances was announced, and permanent measures were planned to adjust staff allowances in line with prices. However, the general public believes that the salary increase for Public Works Department staff is sufficient to stimulate rising prices and hopes that the authorities will adopt a cautious attitude towards such matters in the future. Following the temporary measures, the Public Works Department has decided to have the committee discuss and adjust staff allowance percentages once a month in the future. The details are recorded below:

#### Monthly Review

According to the Public Works Department Information Office, regarding the issuance of allowances to staff, a temporary measure for increasing allowances was decided in June, implemented from May, and it was announced that any new measures adopted would be retroactive to May 1st in terms of benefits granted to staff. By the end of June, the department instructed the Selection Committee to meet and discuss a plan to stipulate a permanent method of periodic adjustment. This adjustment is necessary due to changes in the cost of living. After the committee meeting, it was believed that several sub-committees of the Selection Committee members should be appointed to study and decide on this issue on a monthly basis. The allowance amounts for May, June, and July have now been studied and approved by the Selection Committee and submitted to the Board of Directors of the department as follows:

A. For Chinese staff without contracts; B. For foreign staff and Chinese staff with contracts.

#### Percentage of Allowance Increase

The above measures are intended to allow lower-paid Chinese staff to maintain the same standard of living as in December of last year. However, the compensation received by other Chinese and foreign staff is only half or less than half of the increase in the cost of living since December of last year. The reduction in the July allowance for Chinese staff without contracts reflects the decrease in the cost of living in May and June. The Selection Committee uses a monthly cost of living index to determine the allowance amount for the corresponding month.

#### Over One Million Bags of Rice Stored in Warehouses; Warehouse Staff Resumed Work Yesterday

The Bean and Rice Trade Association's rice storage survey was unable to proceed last week due to the semi-annual closing of accounts in various industries, resulting in a postponed report. The 28th to 119th periods have now been reported separately. The total rice storage in Chinese and foreign rice warehouses throughout the city has reached 1,173,468 bags, an increase of 116,882 bags compared to the 117th period, an average daily increase of over 8,348 bags.

The above storage amounts are limited to various Chinese and foreign warehouses. The rice sold or stored in rice shops, the purchases made by citizens, and the orders placed and transported to Shanghai by various civil food organizations are not included in the survey, totaling approximately 2 million bags.

#### Warehouse Staff Resume Work

The bean and rice industry warehouse staff strike that had been deadlocked for many days has come to an end as the employer representatives have accepted the principles. The warehouse staff has accepted the persuasion of the Bean, Rice, and Miscellaneous Grain Workers' Union and resumed work yesterday. The proposed conditions will be resolved continuously, with further discussions scheduled for the 16th.

### Bandits Robbed Large Sum of Money, Police Detective Found to Have Embezzled It, Detective Flatly Denies It, Detained Pending Investigation

Ren Fengwu, a Chinese detective of the Central Police Department, and detective Huang Hairu, etc., previously apprehended four robbers, including Wang Yongqing, inside and outside the Chekiang Industrial Bank on Peking Road.

At 6:20 a.m. yesterday morning, a large fire suddenly broke out on Zhifusheng Road in western Shanghai. It was said that Zhao Yongxing Bamboo Shop at 333 Zhifusheng Road somehow caught fire.

### Two Lovely Child Refugees, Respectfully Appealing to Society, Already Admitted to Lida Academy as Free Students, Respectfully Requesting Assistance from All Sectors for Boarding and Other Expenses

Received letters from two primary school students at the Child Refugee Education Center at 285 Rue Courbet in the French Concession, with lively and endearing writing. One is Ni Zhaoqi, 14 years old, from Zhenjiang; the other is Bao Jiazeng, 14 years old, from Jiading. Both lost their hometowns in the war and drifted to Shanghai. They were introduced to the Child Refugee Education Center and have now graduated this summer. They have both been admitted to Lida Academy as impoverished free students. However, although tuition is waived, books, boarding, and miscellaneous expenses are also considerable. The two students are poor and have no support, but their desire to learn and advance is truly commendable. We are making a special appeal to society for assistance. If kind-hearted people show sympathy and contribute financially, this newspaper will be happy to collect and forward it to the two students to help them achieve their goals. The letter from Ni Zhaoqi is reproduced below: Dear and Enthusiastic Editor:

I am a child refugee who has suffered due to the impact of war.

Since Zhenjiang was burned down by the flames of war, I followed my parents, siblings, and sisters, tearfully bidding farewell to the embrace of my beautiful hometown and drifting to Shanghai. Since then, the family's finances have been extremely strained. Fortunately, I was helped by philanthropists and introduced to the Shanghai Child Refugee Education Center to study, so I was able to receive a good education again, as if I had embarked on a new journey. This is the comfort I received in my misfortune.

Time dripped in the flowing water, and not even a single drop of water splashed up. Graduation is approaching in a hurry. There is an even more important and difficult problem pressing on my childish, innocent, and active heart! In the past few days, I, who am -4 years old, seem to have grown up several years. The jumping shadows, running shadows, and active shadows on the grass are all gone, and I am just immersed in silent contemplation. Why am I worried and troubled all day long? It is because this center does not run a middle school, my parents' pockets are empty, and who will provide me with money to go to middle school after I graduate from primary school? As for going to work, with my shallow knowledge and experience, where can I go to beg for a bowl of rice to fill my stomach? So my little heart is wounded and saddened by the pain of the world!

In my mind, I often think like this: Since I am a child refugee, the vast future will inevitably be hit by the waves of lack of money, but I must not be timid and discouraged. I must still muster the courage and think of a perfect way to break free from this shackles of extra money, move forward bravely, and the future will naturally be bright.

My tuition is not a problem, because I have passed the exam for a free place for impoverished students at Lida Academy, but there are still many expenses for books, boarding, etc., which I am unable to pay. Because of its lack of finances, this center does not help graduates with any miscellaneous expenses, so I still need to beg the enthusiastic gentlemen in society to be compassionate and help me, a child refugee. I am now like a ship without a rudder in the sea, wandering in the middle, seeing a future with achievements but unable to sail-forward, unable to row to the promised land. How unfortunate! How worthy of people's pity and sigh!

I am looking up, stretching out my hands, and sincerely asking your newspaper to cultivate me, so that my path will be fragrant, brilliant, and complete, ready to dedicate myself to the motherland in the future.

I am waiting for good news! Wishing the editor a pleasant summer! And wishing you success in your work!!

Child Refugee Ni Zhaoqi from the Child Refugee Education Center, respectfully saluting.

Also, Bao Jiazeng, from Jiading, Jiangsu, 14 years old, whose hometown was occupied and parents were scattered after the war, wandering in Shanghai, was introduced to the Child Refugee Education Center. He also graduated this summer and has been admitted to Lida Academy as an impoverished free student, but due to lack of funds for books, boarding, etc., he requests assistance from all sectors.

### The Comedy of American Conscription Hua Zhi

Since the implementation of conscription in the United States, countless funny dramas have occurred in the thousands of conscription offices across the country. Some of these funny dramas are excusable, and some are absurd. It is enough to represent a glimpse of the American national character. The following is an excerpt:

Conscription offices in various places are indeed welcoming to men with sound physical conditions, but they are closing their doors to men who are not sound. Dealing with these people who overestimate themselves is sometimes very tricky. Once, an officer angrily barged into the local conscription office and asked why they had sent a person with a chicken eye, a hernia, and partial paralysis to the military camp. The panicked conscription chief replied that this was his only way to get rid of the cripple, so as to avoid the person's persistent request to join the army. ,

Many clever men got married quickly when the conscription order was issued but not yet effective, thinking that he had the burden of a family and would have the right to avoid military service; but after marriage, they found that family life was far less good than military life and were willing to join the army immediately. The conscription office often receives letters from general wives asking for their husbands, the content of which is: "To the Honorable Sir: My wife and I got married, originally hoping to grow old together. But after a short time, my husband suddenly ran away to the army. Please return him to me."

It is also a problem that children far below the military age insist on enlisting. A conscription chief questioned a child who was applying for enlistment, "What will your parents say when they hear the news that you are going to run away?" The child was embarrassed and answered, "They will probably say: Go, little thing!" Another young man refused to enlist because he had to support his mother. The conscription office summoned his mother and asked her to prove that he could be a soldier. "I used to be a teacher," his mother said eloquently, "and I can still earn a living now." In this way, the people in the conscription office had no choice but to order the young man to stay at home, at least until his mother found a job.

Another polygamist did not want to support his first and second wives and their children, but listed his third wife as a dependent. The first wife was summoned to the conscription office to prove that what he said was indeed true. She hesitated and replied, "No, he doesn't even support me."

The enlistment of dancers has also become a problem in conscription offices. Dancers claim that his wonderful dance toes will lose their effectiveness if he wears military boots. But the authorities did not consider this a sufficient reason. Only one comedian was exempted by the conscription office because his female companion supported the family by performing, and if he enlisted, her life would be in dire straits.

Intellectuals are also dissatisfied with conscription. A pacifist was furious when he heard the news that he was being drafted, and pounded the table and said, "If you don't exempt me, I will sue the court. I will personally appeal to the President. I will fight, fight for my rights. one

Another objector, in view of the various tragedies during the Russian Revolution, decided to avoid all military actions. He used a typewriter to type a twenty-page article, telling the conscription staff about his Tolstoyan theories of peace and war. There was also a pacifist whose vision was even more far-reaching. He said that he believed in Chinese Taoism and wanted to be transformed without action. Enter the sage and transcend the ordinary.

Many unmarried Chinese youths in Chinatown cannot falsely claim to have dependents in China to seek exemption, and most of them obediently enlisted. The army authorities originally intended to promote them, but the laundries and snack shops they painstakingly ran had to close down due to lack of management. A clever overseas Chinese did not want to give up his booming laundry business. He said to the conscription staff, "I can't speak American." Unfortunately, he had already answered the questions of the physical examination officer in very good English. Now it is too late to escape.

### Loneliness

— Lan Wen

Depressed days make life numb, and numb life makes days even more depressed. So everything is over. I forgot others, and others forgot me. Even I forgot myself.

Unfortunately, reality is thorny, and I still remember that I am living in this place, in this era. So I still can't help but feel and think. Logically speaking, this should be considered fortunate.

But, the shadow of loneliness is still so familiar. Is loneliness the inevitable fate of young people?

Some friends ran many places with the mood of "doing something", covered with the dust of foreign lands. He ran from here to there, from far to even farther. The dream of home is also becoming more and more distant.

A light of ideals; drove him, and finally he forgot himself, forgot the past. He suffers, he endures hardships; he does not seek fame or profit. All he has is that mood of "doing something". This is also slightly meager, but can you say that he is not realistic?

However, what greeted him was too much frustration and obstruction. A determined person may know how to fight back and win; unfortunately, God was negligent when creating people: he forgot to impart perseverance to everyone without bias, like ears, eyes, mouth, and nose. But heredity left people with a not-so-lovely inertia. It makes people understand what it means to be tired. Tired of life. So be quiet and silent.

Across the sky and across the sea, my friend's father is back. The bustle of the foreign country has increased with age, and the prosperity is better than in the past. But, clever sir, what can you say he can tell me, and what can my father tell him? Sitting together for a long time, we seem to know quite a lot. But the summer night is shorter!

### Blood Transfusion into Bone

— Xiu

According to recent reports, blood can be transfused into the bone marrow as well as into the blood vessels. Some doctors have tried this new method of blood transfusion seventeen times on fourteen patients, only one of which had poor results.

The doctors said: The liquid injected into the bone marrow can flow into the blood without any changes, and it flows almost as fast as the liquid injected directly into the blood vessels.

The hollow tubes in the bones cannot replace blood as the channel for the flow of blood or other liquids injected into the patient's body. However, sometimes it is difficult for doctors to inject liquids into blood vessels, or they cannot inject them at all. For example, patients have wounds all over their bodies, burns all over their bodies, swollen skin and flesh, are suddenly shocked, their blood vessels are not well developed, or their blood vessels are blocked. In these cases, bone marrow transfusion may be able to bring the dead back to life. The blood vessels of infants are generally not well developed, so it is difficult or even impossible for doctors to perform intravenous injections.

### Mobile Basement

— Revised

American inventors have recently created a mobile basement called the "Underground Trailer" for use as a bomb shelter in air raids. This new type of shelter is equipped with beds, stoves, bathtubs, and all other facilities in a car trailer. All "Underground Trailers" have standard dimensions (8 feet high and 12 feet long), and the roof is made of 3/8-inch thick corrugated steel plates. Each part can be disassembled, transported to any safe and convenient cave for assembly, without the need for lifting machinery.

Ten Loving Father's Heart

Before he could finish speaking, tears welled up in his eyes like a spring.

Qiu Haitang tried his best to avoid looking at him, and a faint smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

"You are a child, you can't endure hardship; as for me, I'm so old, I can endure some more hardship. You don't need to worry about that."

"No, I don't believe this kind of talk, people have never been like this!" Mei Bao said stubbornly.

"Child, be obedient, just listen to me!" Qiu Haitang still used this set of words to answer her. "Anyway, I want to love you like this. You have never quarreled with me about what to eat or what to wear. Child, believe me! I am willing to endure some hardship, not entirely for you!"

"Don't say any more, Dad, it's the same old tune again!" Mei Bao pouted her little mouth and said.

Now, they were almost walking into the village entrance. Mei Bao occasionally looked

Avoid suffering from dampness and summer heat No.

Looking behind, he saw Mei Ruchun, a ten-year-old child living on the left side of his house, running barefoot in the rain, his whole body soaked like a drowned chicken.

"Dad, you are too good to me!" She looked at the completely dry clothes on her body and said with extremely emotional excitement.

"No, child, I should treat you like this. You will definitely be much happier elsewhere than here...!" Qiu Haitang almost blurted out the secret hidden in her heart to her daughter, but finally tried her best to hold back.

Unfortunately, Mei Bao was an extremely clever child. Although she only heard such a vague sentence, a cloud of doubt immediately rose in her heart.

"Elsewhere? Dad, if I'm not with you, where else can I go? Your words are really strange!" She opened her eyes wide and stared firmly at Qiu Haitang's uneven face, as if trying to see her father's secret from those two scars.

"You could have gone to your mother's place." Qiu Haitang glanced at the rain in the sky and said nonchalantly. (156)

### Dog's Air-raid Shelter

— Ke Zhong

In order to protect innocent animals in wartime, the British have organized the National Animal Air Raid Prevention Committee, which is responsible for protecting various domestic animals. If there are any displaced animals, they will find a new family for them. In Kensington, solid concrete air-raid shelters have been built for domestic dogs. Most domestic dogs are trained in advance, and as soon as they hear the alarm, they can automatically run to the air-raid shelter. The shelters are separated by wire mesh, with each dog occupying a room, and chained to prevent ignorant dogs from going out during the air raid. They will regain their freedom only after the alarm is lifted.

### Soviet Film Industry in Wartime

— Jin Chuan

One photography studio covers an area of ​​four square miles. Other important film industry locations include Leningrad, Baku, and cities near the Caspian Sea. The Soviet film industry is quite developed, and many of the equipment is imported from the United States and Germany. There are 500 cinemas in Moscow alone, 200 of which show educational films, completely free of charge. The Soviet film industry is also trying its best to learn from Hollywood, and sends many experts and filmmakers to Hollywood every year to visit and study. But even so, they feel that Hollywood should learn more from them. They claim that whether in terms of artistic or commercial value, Soviet films far exceed Hollywood's productions.

But in the Soviet film capital, there are no people with salaries of hundreds of thousands, and no one has a weekly salary as high as £1,000 like Clark Gable or Garbo. But then again, it would be a big mistake to think that the salaries of Soviet film workers are completely uniform. It is true that every worker in the Soviet Union can find a job, but the size of the salary depends on the nature of the work. An ordinary electrician, recording engineer, etc. can get 200 rubles per month, while administrative personnel and stars can get 1,500 rubles per month. The above is the general situation before the war, and of course there will be some differences after the war.

### A Critique of China Travel's "Thunderstorm"

— Sha Fei

Cao Yu's "Thunderstorm," a four-act tragic drama, is a tearjerker known to women and children alike, so it hardly needs any introduction from me. However, this time, China Travel's performance at the Tianchan Theater has a slight change in the lineup because Tang Ruoqing is unable to perform due to a contract with Huanian. The cast is as follows: Sun Jinglu as Sifeng, Tang Huaiqiu as Zhou Puyuan, Ge Xin as Lu Gui, Chou Quan as Lu Dahai, Wu Jingping as Zhou Chong, Xia Duowen as Zhou Fanyi, Zhang Xuemei as Lu Shiping, and Zhao Shu as Zhou Ping.

I don't think this lineup is very balanced. The skill levels are too far apart, and the acting achievements are worlds apart. The good ones are truly good, leaving you speechless with admiration, while the bad ones are truly bad, making you so frustrated that you can hardly breathe.

Sun Jinglu's Sifeng, from the moment she appears on stage, speaks in a clear and sweet Mandarin accent. From the first act to the fourth, she consistently captures the audience's hearts. Her facial expressions and demeanor are natural and lively. Tang Huaiqiu's Zhou Puyuan has a special style when he comes out from backstage. His left hand is stiff, and his body is rigid, giving people a subtle thrill. Ge Xin's Lu Gui is very dutiful in his performance, but it doesn't seem to be expressive enough in terms of personality. We know that Lu Gui, in Cao Yu's pen, is a villain who is insidious, playful, muddle-headed, good at flattering, and bullies the weak and clings to the strong. Ge Xin's expression is only superficial. I saw Wang Xianqi's Lu Gui before, and he was much stronger and more profound. Chou Quan's Lu Dahai is very fitting for the role, appearing foolish but with a passionate heart and full of courage. After he appears on stage, he is best able to focus the audience's attention. Wu Jingping's Zhou Chong lacks innocence and is almost stiff. Xia Duowen's Zhou Fanyi completely imitates Tang Ruoqing's style. She never relaxes her grip on this character from beginning to end, but unfortunately, she is too calm and dull. Zhang Xuemei's Lu Shiping is only seen walking around on stage, and we don't see any inner expression from her. In fact, this character is also very easy to please the audience. Zhao Shu's Zhou Ping looks too young, his intonation is not enough, and his movements are also awkward. In terms of effects, because the stage is too big, it is not realistic enough. Only a few dog barks still make people yearn for it.

Since the marital change of Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua, there have been many records and commentaries from the outside world, but there has been no solution. It is a pity! Here are three solutions, sent to Zhou Xuan, hoping she will adopt them.

(1) Reconcile and get back together. If there is any more abuse, immediately get a divorce.

(2) Separate, devote to art, or leave Shanghai and transfer to work in the Great Rear Area.

(3) Divorce, and from then on, do not associate with anyone who is said to be related to the marital change, to prove that this change was purely due to disagreement.

### Small Biographies of Figures in the Pear Garden

People from the North and South in Biography, Illustrated by Zhang Yuzhang

(21) Li Shengzao

Li Shengzao is the sixth son of the late famous Kunqu opera artist Li Shoufeng (Shoufeng, along with painted-face Li Shoushan and martial artist Li Xinfu, were brothers). He began studying at the age of eleven when he entered the Fuliancheng Opera School, studying the Laosheng (old male) role under Jin Sihong Cai Yuting. Cai was one of the major contributors to the fame of Ma Lianliang. Seeing that Shengzao's singing and elegant figure were just like Lianliang's, he taught him to specialize in the spoken parts of the acting. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), Cai led the disciples of the Sheng class of the Fu Society south for the first time. Shengzao's name was prominently displayed, and the audience praised his acting and recitations as being close to Lianliang's, while his singing was even better. He was the only Laosheng among the fourth class of the Fu Society. His wife is Gao, the daughter of Gao Qingkui. Qingkui also taught him the plays he excelled at. Last year, he brought the Kun Dan (female role) Tong Zhinan south to work for Huang Jin, and his skills have improved and his reputation has grown. His fifth brother, Sheng Yin, initially studied martial arts, but now manages all of Shengzao's theatrical affairs.

Chapter 12: As Helpless as Ning Wuzi

The old monk chanted "Amitabha" with his palms together and said, "Please follow this humble monk, Generals." So Liu Yinying and Xu Jing led their horses in. The old monk closed the temple door again, led them through a dilapidated hall, and settled them in a cloud room. He said tremblingly to the two men, "This small temple is in this mountain hollow, and the incense is very scarce. There were originally three or four monks and a incense server in the temple, but now because there is war at Ningwu Pass, they are all afraid that the bandits will come to burn and kill, so they have long avoided it. Only this old monk is old and frail, so I have stayed here alone. If you two generals have any orders, this humble monk will naturally comply." Xu Jing said, "Do you have any rice in your temple? Please cook us a pot of porridge, my stomach is a little hungry, but I don't need anything else." The old monk agreed repeatedly and left. Liu Yinying saw that Xu Jing's arm was still dripping blood, so he went forward and slowly rolled up Xu Jing's left arm, seeing that a piece of flesh had been cut off below the elbow, so Xu Jing's body was also stained with a lot of blood. Liu Yinying tore a relatively clean piece of cloth from his soiled battle robe and carefully wrapped the wound for him. He asked, "Brother Jing, how did you get hurt?" Xu Jing told Liu Yinying about the experience of rushing out of the pass to fight today and thanked him for his help. Then he asked him, "General Zhou and I have been looking forward to your virtuous brother coming to help us kill the bandits every day, and you have also personally promised that you can serve the country when the soldiers arrive. Why haven't you come all this time, making people look forward to you in vain? With your good skills, why don't you serve the country at this time? When are you waiting? I can't help but be suspicious." Liu Yinying frowned and replied, "Brother Jing, you don't know that although I want to come and kill the bandits together, my aunt will definitely not let me go out when she finds out. Later, my aunt heard that the bandits attacked Daizhou and was frightened, and she was bedridden again, and she would not allow me to go down the mountain. I was very anxious. When I heard that Daizhou had fallen, General Zhou retreated to Ningwu, and the old hero Wang had died on the battlefield, I was both respectful and sad. I was very concerned about your safety and thought you had retreated to Ningwu with General Zhou. (113)
