### Fierce Battles Unfold in Northern Hunan: Japanese Forces Heavily Mauled on Both Banks of the Miluo River; Advancing Japanese Troops Everywhere Encountered Resistance from Chinese Forces; Chinese Forces in Jiangxi and Hubei Provinces Launch Attacks to Tie Down Japanese Troops

Chongqing: The battle situation in northern Hunan has reached a fever pitch. Yesterday, Chinese forces engaged in fierce battles with Japanese troops everywhere in the area west of Pingjiang and east of Dongting Lake, on both banks of the Miluo River, advancing wave upon wave, disregarding personal safety. Japanese troop casualties on both banks of the Miluo River were very heavy, and the river water was completely red. Fierce fighting was especially intense in Tingjiang southwest of Pingjiang and Lulin Tan across from Xiangyin. A unit of Japanese troops attempted to infiltrate Jinjing yesterday, but was mostly annihilated by a large force of Chinese troops. The Chinese Air Force also flew to the front lines yesterday to assist in the battle. It is believed here that the battle situation has reached a decisive stage, and it is expected that the main force of the Japanese army will be annihilated north of Changsha. (25th dispatch)

Chongqing: According to recent battle reports from the front lines, the situation on the Hunan front is now particularly strained. The Japanese army is currently attempting to probe south towards Changsha in several directions. The Japanese army, currently concentrated in the Xinshi, Wugongshi, and Yukou areas on the south bank of the Miluo River, numbers 20,000 troops. They resumed their offensive on September 23. The left flank of the Japanese army at Yukou advanced southeast, reaching the main road near Lijiangpu on the west side of Pingjiang. Fierce fighting is currently underway in that area, with Chinese troops fighting desperately to resist. The central route of the Japanese army at Wugongshi is currently advancing south and southeast. The left flank of the Japanese army at Xinshi is advancing southwest. At the same time, Japanese warships and aircraft are still heavily bombarding Chinese military positions on the southeastern shore of Dongting Lake, attempting to cover the Japanese landing near Yingtian, but all have been bravely repelled by Chinese forces under machine gun and bomb fire. The Japanese army is currently using giant tank units in an attempt to break through the Chinese defensive fortifications on the shore. Chinese forces in Jiangxi and Hubei provinces are now launching offensives to tie down the Japanese army. Chinese forces in northern Jiangxi have crossed the Xiushui River and are currently attacking the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway near Yongxiu. Chinese forces in northern Hubei are currently attacking Suixian County. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

Changde: This morning, many Japanese warships and boats infiltrated Hengling Lake via Yan’anshan and Qingshan, and at 8:00 AM, they fiercely bombarded the Doumi Ju area. At the same time, several Japanese aircraft flew to the陣上空, alternately bombing. The Chinese lakefront garrison fought bravely despite the intense bombing by Japanese aircraft. They are still fighting bloody battles. (24th dispatch)

Zhaoqing: The focal point of the battle in the Siyi region has now shifted to Sanbu (belonging to Taishan). The suburbs are still under Chinese military control. Japanese troops in the Changsha (this is not Changsha in Hunan Province) area were ambushed by Chinese troops, and more than half were killed or wounded. The remaining troops are being encircled and annihilated by Chinese troops.

Chongqing: Military sources here announced today that the war in Hunan Province seems to have entered its most critical stage. The fate of Changsha has not yet been decided. There is also fierce fighting in Guangdong. Military sources say that Chinese and Japanese forces are facing each other between Xiangyin and Pingjiang, northeast of Changsha. The fighting is very fierce. The Japanese are also conducting large-scale air raids on Hengyang in Hunan Province. Hengyang has also been attacked. Hengyang is one of the important transportation centers of Free China south of the Yangtze River and is clearly one of the Japanese army's targets in this offensive in Hunan Province. An official communiqué stated that four Japanese columns are jointly heading towards Changsha east of the railway. There are also landing forces on the west side of the railway. Yesterday, they all made slight progress, but suffered heavy casualties. As for the Japanese column on the east side, they advanced south from Pingjiang via Wengjiang (transliteration), their original strength being 7,000 men. They suffered heavy losses on Monday night. Fierce fighting is still underway in that area. The other three columns are fighting in Yukou, Wushengshi (transliteration), Xinshi, and strongholds on the south bank of the Miluo River. There is also fighting in the Lulin Tan area on both sides of the Xiang River. The Japanese army attempted to land in Yingtian on Tuesday morning but was repelled. Regarding the war in Guangdong, the communiqué stated that the Japanese army that attacked from Xinhui occupied Danshuikou on Monday morning. Danshuikou is located north of Taishan and is the confluence of highways, railways, and rivers. Many overseas Chinese in the United States come from that area. Under government orders, they are carrying millions to relieve the refugees in Taishan. Ma Chaojun, the former mayor of Nanjing, declared that the Japanese army is clearly attempting to establish a new front line west of the Pearl River, going from Guanghai via Taishan, Xinhui, Jiangmen, and Shunde to Guangzhou. The purpose of this move is to cut off the supply line in the Xijiang area. Mr. Ma said that it took the Japanese army two days to advance from Guanghai to Taishan, which shows that the strength of the Chinese army has increased. Mr. Ma also said that the wealthy residents of Taishan, because they had experience in the past, so when about 3,000 Japanese troops advanced north from Guanghai, and another 2,000 advanced west from Jiangmen and Xinhui, jointly approaching Taishan. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

Changsha: Wang Guisheng, the helmsman of the Su Sanye ferry in Baima Township, Xiangyin, was carrying Platoon Leader Cao Hanzhang of a certain division out to the lake to attack the Japanese when he encountered four Japanese motorboats at Lijia Tai.

Then he tightened the sail rope and used the wind to capsize the boat, dying together with the Japanese army. Also, when the Japanese army occupied Qingshan, there were more than a dozen passionate young people who vowed not to surrender and made heroic sacrifices together.

Editorial

### Modification or Abolition of the Neutrality Act

In a speech delivered on the 23rd of this month at the launching ceremony of the new warship Massachusetts, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated, "The time when we could play with the Neutrality Act is past.

The Neutrality Act is no longer an asset but an encumbrance to us." Looking at the current international situation, this is indeed the case.

Tracing the origins of the Neutrality Act, it was precisely during the time when Italy was preparing to invade Abyssinia in 1935, and the crisis in Europe was intensifying. At that time, the aversion to the previous European war was still extremely strong among Americans. The general demand was to no longer get involved in the quagmire of war. Thus, in August of that year, a temporary Neutrality Act was passed in Congress, stipulating that the President could order the prohibition of transporting arms and military supplies to belligerent nations, and prohibit American ships from directly or indirectly carrying such items to belligerent nations. Even Americans traveling on ships of belligerent nations were prohibited. The intention was naturally for the sake of America's own security, cutting off all paths that could bring war closer to the United States. However, on the other hand, it treated the aggressor and the victim of aggression equally, disregarding the responsibility the United States bore for international justice. In the Italo-Ethiopian War, the failure of the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy was at least partially the responsibility of this Neutrality Act. When the original bill expired in January of the following year, it was slightly modified in February, extending its validity until May 1, 1937. An important point in this modification was to classify the Americas as an exception. If American countries were to engage in war with countries outside the Western Hemisphere, American countries would not be bound by this act. It can be seen that at that time the United States had already recognized the major defects of the act, but it still absolutely refused to take even a little risk for justice for issues outside of the United States. This point aroused severe criticism from both the government and the public, both within and outside of America. When the act expired again in 1937, there was much debate, but the result was that, apart from adding the "cash and carry" clause applicable to raw materials other than arms, there was no change to the essence of the act. Moreover, the act was made permanent. At that time, the People's Front and the rebels in Spain were engaged in a fierce battle. In the Far East, China and Japan were on the eve of a split. However, this new Neutrality Act only facilitated the aggressors who had money and ships and did not consider the position of the invaded countries and peoples in the slightest. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, fortunately, the U.S. authorities consistently refused to invoke the act, so China has not directly suffered the ill effects of the Neutrality Act. However, the existence of that act has invisibly hindered the United States from participating in the implementation of international joint sanctions against aggression. By the spring of 1939, the Spanish government forces were on the verge of collapse, and the war in Europe was increasingly imminent. Not only had the majority of people in the United States who upheld justice already called for the abolition of the act, but President Roosevelt also believed that it was necessary to modify it. The issue of abolishing the arms embargo clause was almost always a point of contention and was shelved due to the obstruction of isolationists. It was not until after the outbreak of the European war that an amendment was passed in early November, abolishing the arms embargo clause and applying the "cash and carry" principle to arms. However, it still prohibited American ships from entering war zones and made no distinction between aggressors and victims of aggression. This naturally did not eliminate its irrational nature, but in view of the internal situation in the United States at that time, it was already the maximum extent of modification.

The existence of this Neutrality Act certainly conformed to the American creed of "glorious isolation," but it also contradicted the tradition of maritime freedom and neutral country rights that the United States had firmly advocated in the past. Security and peace are indivisible. With the progress of modern weapons and transportation technology, no country can absolutely close its doors and remain ignorant of right and wrong. Moreover, although the United States is geographically isolated from other parts of the world, it is closely linked to every corner of the world in terms of political and economic relations. In addition to its own interests, it also bears significant obligations and responsibilities in terms of international treaties and justice and humanity. Therefore, when Britain and France unfortunately lost on the Western Front last summer, the Neutrality Act lost its reason for existence. However, the American authorities under Roosevelt preferred to explore other paths to carry out the task of assisting democratic countries in combating aggression, rather than rigidly wasting time and energy on legislative disputes and meaningless debates. For example, the establishment of the Lend-Lease Act, the expansion of patrol ranges, the acquisition of Iceland and Greenland, the establishment of loans to the Soviet Union, the issuance of the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration, and the recent order to shoot at German and Italian warships first were all, in spirit, far beyond the danger of participation in the war that the Neutrality Act sought to prevent. Formally, they did not violate the provisions of the act. For example, American ships sailing to the Red Sea must first deny that the area is a war zone. This shows the difficulties the American authorities face in seeking a way out. Particularly ridiculous is that American commercial ships heading to Iceland had to be registered in Panama to avoid violating the provisions of the Neutrality Act. The number reached as many as 125. This fact was not widely known until recently, when American ships in the North Atlantic were frequently sunk by German submarines. This shows the painstaking efforts of the American authorities, and it also shows the irrationality of the existence of the Neutrality Act. Certain more pressing tasks, such as American ships sailing directly to Britain, the arming of merchant ships, and naval escorts outside the patrol area, cannot be carried out due to the provisions of the act. From this, it can be seen that the modification or abolition of the Neutrality Act is inevitable and cannot be delayed today.

Although there are loud calls for the United States to participate in the war, unless there are more significant changes in the international situation, such a move is still premature. Moreover, although the isolationists have seen their influence wane, they have not disappeared. Perhaps the American authorities will temporarily propose an amendment to the Neutrality Act so that the task of assisting Britain and the Soviet Union and combating Germany and Italy can be carried out fully and effectively. When the appropriation of 40 billion in new military expenditures is submitted to Congress, this move will naturally be necessary. As for the Far East, it has not suffered significant damage in practice due to the existence of the Neutrality Act in the past, and its modification or cancellation should not have much impact. However, if the Neutrality Act can be fundamentally abolished, it would truly indicate that the United States has the full determination to fight at all costs and can no longer be intimidated by any war-monger. This would have some significant and subtle effects on clarifying the dangerous situation in the Far East and even the world.

### U.S. President to Submit Message Requesting Repeal of Neutrality Act Expected to be Passed by Congress Navy Asks for Funds to Arm Merchant Ships

Reuters, New York, 25th - Well-informed sources in Washington believe that President Roosevelt's message to Congress next week will not be limited to requesting the repeal of the Neutrality Act.

Reuters, Washington, 25th - It was reported here yesterday that President Roosevelt will request a revision of the Neutrality Act next week, which is practically equivalent to repeal. It is reported that officials in the government are strongly urging the President to propose deleting the provisions of the Neutrality Act that prohibit American ships from sailing into belligerent ports or combat zones. Senator Connally, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that, with the exception of provisions that are suitable for needs, such as government control of arms exports, the remainder must be deleted. As for the idea that American ships do not sail into combat zones, so they can avoid attack, it is now clearly illusory. The attacks on the merchant ship Robin Moor and the destroyer Greer are proof of this. If the Nazis can attack American ships anywhere, then the United States has no reason to continue to abide by the combat zone restrictions. According to national law, American ships have the right to sail at will on the high seas. Arming American merchant ships is a necessary measure. Nazi submarines, airplanes, and raiders can attack American ships on the high seas where American ships have the right to sail, so American ships should naturally have the right to carry firearms for self-defense. I will initiate an amendment to allow the arming of merchant ships, and I think people in Congress will support it. Speaker of the House Rayburn also predicted that the House of Representatives would pass the merchant ship arming plan.

Reuters, Washington, 25th - President Roosevelt's secretary, O'Leary, said yesterday that there is no reason to believe that the President does not intend to announce his decision on the arming of merchant ships and the amendment of the Neutrality Act next week. The White House has not received any indications that opponents will obstruct the amendment of the Neutrality Act in Congress.

United Press, Washington, 25th - The Navy Department and Congress here said yesterday that the Navy has sufficient cannons to arm American merchant ships not registered in Panama, and has sufficient manpower and resources to arm the entire American merchant fleet. The House Appropriations Committee yesterday released an official request from the Navy, with the Navy Department requesting $75,888,820 to arm ships during the dangerous period when they enter dangerous areas. It is also learned that before the 5-inch guns are delivered, the ships can be equipped with 3-inch to 4-inch cannons.

United Press, Washington, 24th - New York City Mayor and Chairman of the American People's Air Raid Prevention Committee La Guardia yesterday asked Congress to authorize the committee with as much manpower and resources as possible to deal with any bombing attacks. The mayor told Texas Democratic Congressman and Speaker of the House Rayburn that it was necessary to take this step. He also said that most areas in the United States are at risk of air raids, and it is necessary to take precautions. However, many cities are unable to make self-defense arrangements, such as purchasing gas masks, fire-fighting equipment, medical supplies, and other matters, which should be funded and facilitated by the state.

### The Far East is Temporarily Quiet Not a Time for Complacency British Commander-in-Chief Issues Statement Burma Should Provide as Much Assistance as Possible to China

Reuters, Rangoon, 15th - After inspecting Burmese defenses, British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, who had returned to Rangoon, told reporters today that the current temporary tranquility in the Far East is not a time for complacency. We must know that this tranquility is actually a fluke. We should make as much use of it as possible to obtain real value from this time. Brooke-Popham praised the new airfields he had visited and the roads he had passed. However, he stressed that defensive works and training still need to be greatly improved in order to guarantee the peace and security of Burma. Brooke-Popham solemnly stated that any situation occurring outside of Burma in this war will have a direct impact on Burma. For example, China's situation will directly affect the situation in this region. Therefore, Burma should provide all possible assistance to China. Brooke-Popham concluded by saying that the more prepared Burma is, the fewer chances there will be for Burma to be attacked.

### US-Japan Situation

Reuters, Chongqing, 25th - Well-informed circles believe that the situation between the United States and Japan will not immediately become tense because Japan is now making every effort to appease the United States.

United Press, New York, 25th - The New York Herald Tribune yesterday quoted reliable sources as saying that the U.S.-Japan talks have reached a critical stage, and President Roosevelt is now doing his best to prevent the talks from collapsing. The newspaper reported that the biggest obstacle to the talks is Japan's unwillingness to give a definite guarantee not to attack Siberia.

United Press, Tokyo, 25th - Fascist leader Nakano said today that the Japanese people need a stronger foreign policy. He does not believe that Britain and the United States will fight for the Dutch East Indies, but if Britain and the United States do fight Japan, Japan may be fully prepared. Nakano also said that unless Japan surrenders, Prime Minister Konoe will not be able to reach an agreement with the United States. If Japan yields to U.S. demands, Japan will be defeated. The Japanese people will never tolerate this.

### Reports of Attacks on French Ports British Side Denies

Reuters, London, 25th - Reports that British troops had attacked a French Somali port near Djibouti have been officially denied here today. However, it is reported that the French authorities in Djibouti, in order to reduce the number of useless mouths to feed, have forced local residents (non-British) to eat in British military zones, threatening to shoot them if they return to the French zone.

### Twenty Soviet Warships Arrive in Vladivostok Anzai Gives Radio Address Discussing Impressions of U.S. Aid to Soviet Union

International News Service, London, 25th - The Daily Express today carried a report from the Agukerss No Money Radio Station stating that twenty Soviet warships have arrived in Vladivostok from the Arctic Ocean, strengthening the strength of the Soviet Far Eastern Fleet.

United Press, Tokyo, 25th - Deputy Spokesperson of the Cabinet Information Bureau Anzai broadcast to the nation last night, explaining the Japanese people's impressions of American aid to the Soviet Union. He said that the US ability to aid the Soviet Union from Vladivostok is limited. He also said that, setting aside the amount of aid to the Soviet Union, American ships carrying aircraft, gasoline, and other goods are being transported to the Soviet Union in areas adjacent to Japanese territorial waters, while at the same time intensifying the embargo against Japan. The general Japanese public views this as being the same as when British warships forcibly inspected Japanese ships near Mount Fuji last year. The entire Japanese population was extremely shocked by this incident, so the Japanese government had no choice but to send notes to the US and Soviet governments.

Reuters, Chongqing, 25th - Since the German army won on the Eastern Front, various Chinese circles here believe that this matter will bring Japanese-Soviet warfare closer. Therefore, they are now closely monitoring the development of Japanese-Soviet relations. According to reliable intelligence received by military authorities here, the number of Japanese troops concentrated in areas along the Soviet border is approximately 580,000 to 800,000, while the Soviet side has 600,000 troops. The Japanese army will not launch an attack on the Soviet Union until Leningrad has fallen or Moscow is under real threat.

### Key to the Pacific Situation Controlled by the United States U.S. and Britain Constantly Station Fleets and Armies The Far East Should Not Experience Incidents

Reuters, Batavia, 25th - Former New York Times Shanghai correspondent Abend, who is currently touring the Dutch East Indies, told reporters here today that he does not trust the U.S.-Japan talks in Washington. If the United States places its fleet in the Pacific and Britain continues to station its army in Malaya, and if this remains unchanged, then no incidents will occur. However, if the United States moves its fleet to the Atlantic and Britain withdraws its troops from Malaya, Japan will immediately take the opportunity to steal a march. He predicts that Japan will first attack the Soviet Union and then continue to advance south. Abend is currently reporting to American readers while touring the Philippines and Australia. At the same time, representative of the American National Broadcasting Company, the famous commentator Yang, who recently visited Japan, is also planning to stay here for three weeks. According to his observations, the U.S.-Japan discussions in Washington will continue after Japanese Deputy Ambassador to the U.S. Wakasugi returns to the U.S. from Tokyo. He believes that U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Nomura are both capable of fulfilling their duties. Yang also said that the key to the entire situation in the Pacific is in the hands of the United States, and it only needs to be expressed and utilized by the United States.

Haitong News Agency, 25th - British High Commissioner to Australia, Close, said in Melbourne yesterday that British-Japanese relations are "poor" and that Japan should be held responsible for this.

### The Situation in Thailand Has Become More Moderate Border Defenses are Being Strengthened

United Press, Bangkok, 25th - Important Thai officials said yesterday that they believe the situation in Thailand has recently eased slightly. The reasons for this are: (1) the strengthening of Singapore's defenses and the close cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies; (2) President Roosevelt's announcement that he will extend the sea lanes through which lend-lease items are sent to include the Pacific Ocean; (3) the rumored concentration of Japanese troops in Manchuria. Although Thailand lacks modern weapons such as airplanes, tanks, cannons, and machine guns, it is still constantly strengthening its eastern and northeastern borders. Many Thai reservists have been called into service, and the current troops have also exceeded their proper period of service and have not been relieved. United Press has learned that obstacles such as landmines, tank traps, outposts, and artillery fortifications in mountain passes are being built on the border. It is believed that Thailand currently has 200 aircraft, and small air-raid shelters to protect against bomb fragments have been built in Bangkok and other centers. However, the main method of air defense is to disperse the population into fields and thickets. Recent news said that Japan has 35,000 to 40,000 troops stationed in Vietnam. Naval officials believe that the acquisition of Saigon is helpful to Japan, but it is not enough to be a first-class base. If they want to make it a first-class base, it will take 18 months to several years of construction. If Japan attempts to occupy Thailand, it will get very little except land and rice. But if it conquers the southern part of old Siam, it can obtain iron ore, especially tin. If you fly from Singapore to Bangkok, you can clearly see that Thailand grows almost nothing but rice. Millions of acres of good land are planted with rice. Rice accounts for four-fifths of Thailand's exports. From the air, Malaya has many rubber, tin, and sugar cane plants in addition to rice. Flying from Singapore to Bangkok via Penang takes seven hours and passes the world's largest tin mine near Penang, which produces two-fifths of the world's output. Thais are similar in constitution and ethnicity to Filipinos. They are self-respecting and happy people with no close ties to Japan.

### American Federation of Labor Donates Funds to Support China

United Press, New York, 25th - A spokesman for the American Federation of Labor assured yesterday that the Federation would take swift steps to cooperate with the United China Relief to raise funds to support China. Yesterday, local, state, and international representatives of the AFL were guests of honor at a luncheon held by the China Relief Society.

### Darlan Meets Kato in Vichy Discusses Franco-Japanese Relations

Reuters, Vichy, 25th - The French official news agency said that Vichy Premier Darlan met with Japanese Ambassador Kato yesterday to discuss relations between Vichy and Japan and the situation in Japan.

Reuters, Batavia, 25th

A Dutchman who arrived here from Saigon told reporters today that Vietnam has now almost become a province of Japan, and the French have practically no power. After the newly appointed Ambassador Sawada arrives in Vietnam, he will take over the Vietnamese administration. Although Decoux is still the Governor-General, he is only so in name. Vietnam was completely unable to resist the Japanese military occupation, so Vietnam can now be regarded as no longer belonging to France.

### Economic Controls Implemented in Vietnam

Havas News Agency, Saigon, 24th - Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux broadcast today, explaining the political and economic situation in Vietnam. He said that Vietnam has already encountered various difficulties in its economy and has no choice but to implement a controlled economy to overcome them. The government has initiated the organization of rubber companies to manage rubber exports, which is one measure. Recently, Vietnam also reached an agreement with Japan, which stipulates regulations for trade in rice and its by-products, which is the second measure. In addition, the Vietnamese government has also sought to maintain trade ties between its affiliated territories and France, as this trade is indispensable to Vietnam. In terms of agriculture, we have also made considerable progress. Large-scale water conservancy projects have been completed, and irrigation is convenient, which has greatly benefited agricultural affairs. Improvements in rubber cultivation have also achieved good results. The government has also recruited experts to establish a rubber research institute to strive for continuous improvement. In short, economic instability will inevitably lead to various difficulties. It is hoped that the Vietnamese people will be able to openly and honestly cooperate with the government, because only cooperation between the upper and lower levels can enable Vietnam to overcome difficulties in the midst of world panic.

### In the Leningrad Sector Soviet and German Forces Stage Contest British Planes Participate in the Defense of Leningrad Central Red Army Crosses the Dvina River

TASS, Moscow, 25th - On the 24th, our army fought with the enemy along the entire front. At a certain point along the entire front, Soviet and German tanks engaged in fierce fighting. The tank team led by Voshnikov defeated a German tank team, destroying 20 enemy tanks and capturing 16 enemy tanks. 117 enemy tank crew members were captured.

United Press, London, 25th - The Leningrad battle, which has been raging for 30 days, flared up again yesterday. This may be the result of the reported Soviet counteroffensive being launched along the entire front. It is quite unclear what the Leningrad battle situation is, but military officials here are quite skeptical of German claims that they have broken through Soviet defenses and reached the outskirts of the city, as the Germans made similar reports a week ago. However, the statement by Leningrad wireless that "enemy forces have reached the gates of the city" seems to confirm the German claims. It is reported that Marshal Voroshilov is still fiercely resisting the German attempts to capture Leningrad and has launched several counteroffensives, and it is reported that three villages have been recaptured in the counteroffensive. Even though the fighting is fierce, Leningrad's defenders have not been broken through or retreated by the Germans, and military officials believe that the battle of Leningrad will not remain deadlocked, as the Germans have already formed a small wedge in the Soviet line that can be used for a final breakthrough. Some reports say that the German military is already anticipating that Leningrad will be occupied within the next two days or no later than next Thursday.

Reuters, Vichy, 25th - The French official news agency quoted a Stockholm report as saying that British planes are now participating in the defense of Leningrad. With the help of British planes, the Soviet Air Force has inflicted heavy losses on the Germans. The Soviet fleet is also assisting Leningrad's defenders. The actions of German forces on this front are greatly hampered by the rain, and the nights are extremely cold. Soviet forces on the islands of Oesel and Dago, formerly part of Estonia, are still fiercely resisting attacks by Nazi aircraft, paratroopers, and infantry. In the far north, German forces launched a new offensive against Murmansk, which has been repulsed by Soviet forces. Soviet aircraft and warships have sunk several German troop transports and supply ships en route to Norway. In the south, Soviet General Butni has withdrawn part of his troops to new positions on the Donets River.

TASS, 25th, battlefield report - A few days ago, the Central Red Army achieved brilliant results on the banks of the Dvina River. First, the German army forcibly crossed the river and reached the east bank of the river, attempting to continue the offensive, but was blocked by the heroic resistance of the Red Army. The German army then quickly consolidated its positions, attempting to hold firm. The Red Army launched a counteroffensive on the same day. Under the cover of artillery and tanks, the Red Army shattered the stubborn resistance of the Nazi army, capturing key points in succession and forcing the enemy to retreat to the west bank of the Dvina River. The Red Army also captured the military road of Tongda D Village. In this battle, the entire German 102nd Division was defeated, with deaths reaching two regiments.

Reuters, London, 25th - According to officials here, it is now believed that the German army is currently developing an offensive against Crimea with four divisions or 70,000 troops. The isthmus has an extremely narrow neck, and the German army is attempting to pass through it in one fell swoop. The German army may also launch another offensive further east on the isthmus, as there is a very small space there that is easy to build pontoon bridges. This German offensive is based on the east bank of the Dnieper River.

### Setback for German-Finnish Offensive on the Murmansk Front

Reuters, London, 25th – Yesterday, Berlin and Moscow both broadcast about the terrible struggle in the Leningrad area, describing the back-and-forth between the two armies. The German side claimed to have occupied a "considerably large" city, saying that the German forces encountered staunch resistance from the defending troops before occupying the city, resulting in fierce street battles. The German side also claimed to have seized another section of Leningrad's defenses, stating that the German forces had occupied strong positions and destroyed several fortresses, inflicting heavy losses on the Soviet army. However, the Soviet Red Star reported that there was fighting on the bridges leading to Leningrad, and the German offensive had been repelled. The Soviet army also launched a series of counterattacks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The Red Star's first-line dispatch stated that on Tuesday, the Soviet army counterattacked and engaged the enemy in fierce fighting throughout the day. The Soviet army forced the German 126th Infantry Division to retreat and captured strongly defended positions. Although the German side used tanks to assist infantry operations, they were still forced to retreat, leaving many German soldiers dead on the battlefield. In the first sector southeast of Leningrad, the German forces launched a wedge-shaped offensive, penetrating the Soviet defenses, but were driven back by Soviet "Cossack tanks." The term "Cossack tanks" is new. The Red Star also stated that when Soviet-Finnish troops attacked on the Murmansk front, the German 136th and 137th Alpine Regiments suffered significant casualties. From August 8th to 15th, 2,000 German soldiers were killed in action, and repeated attacks were repelled.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th – According to German military headquarters, the annihilation battle east of Kyiv has entered its final stage, and enemy attempts to break through have been repelled. Leningrad is being increasingly surrounded. According to official Moscow sources, in addition to the Soviet army and the Baltic Fleet, the entire population is participating in the defense of Leningrad. The city is now completely isolated from the interior, and the Soviet fleet in Kronstadt has also suffered heavy damage. The city currently has a military and civilian population of 4.5 million.

United Press, Berlin, 25th – A certain German authoritative military spokesperson stated yesterday that after the German forces broke through the Soviet defense lines and intensified the encirclement of Leningrad, they "have reached the outskirts of Leningrad." The spokesperson reiterated what German newspapers claimed last week: that the citizens of Leningrad are facing the fate of Warsaw due to their determination to defend the city. The German official news agency recently stated that German forces have occupied a certain town on the road to Leningrad, and other German troops are said to have occupied positions outside the city of Leningrad.

### Bloody Tank Battle Between Soviet and German Forces in the Ukrainian Orchard Region

Reuters, London, 25th – Activity has increased again on the Odessa front. Near Kherson, the two armies are engaged in fierce fighting, vying for the Soviet-held "N" point. According to dispatches from Moscow, the German side has deployed more reserve troops, but after a bloody battle, they have been repelled by the Soviet army. In this battle, German soldiers were piled up like mountains in tank traps, totaling approximately 1,500 bodies. The Soviet army holds firmly defended positions at "N" point. The German army launched repeated attacks with all its might, once breaking through the first line of Soviet defense. The Soviet commander deployed reserve troops, forcing the German army to retreat. The news carried by the Red Star refutes the German claim that the German army has advanced to the Perekop Isthmus, isolating the Crimean Peninsula. The Red Star did not explicitly state the distance from Kherson where the battle took place. Kherson is located on the high right bank of the Dnieper River, 20 miles from the river mouth, and is one of the largest cities along the Dnieper River. The area can be called the orchard of Ukraine because it produces the best grapes and peaches.

Haitong News Agency, German Führer's Headquarters, 25th – Today's German military report stated that the Soviet troops trapped east of Kyiv are fighting desperately, suffering heavy casualties. The remains of Lieutenant General Kirponos, commander of the Southwestern Front of the Soviet army, have been found on the battlefield. The Soviet 5th and 21st Armies have been annihilated. German aircraft heavily bombed military facilities in Moscow last night, as well as the Tula armaments factory.

TASS, Moscow, 25th – The Romanian 13th and 15th Divisions were recently sent to the Odessa front to reinforce and attack Odessa, but they were all repelled by our army. Our army captured two artillery pieces, 100 machine guns, and many other war materials.

TASS, Moscow, 22nd – On the Southern Front, the Red Army achieved a major victory in a certain battle. 1,500 German soldiers were killed, and 4,000 were wounded. Our army destroyed or captured 20 enemy artillery pieces, 70 machine guns, and many other war materials.

### Achievements of the Soviet Air Force

Reuters, London, 25th – Yesterday's Soviet broadcast mentioned the combat record of the Soviet naval air force. Its supplementary communiqué stated that the Soviet Baltic Fleet's air force shot down 13 German aircraft on Sunday and destroyed 10 German aircraft on the airfield. Soviet naval bombers also destroyed two German anti-aircraft artillery batteries, 11 anti-aircraft machine gun positions, 14 armored vehicles, and eight artillery pieces on the road to Leningrad. The Soviet Black Sea Fleet's air force also destroyed 11 enemy aircraft on the airfield. TASS, Central Front, 25th

The Red Army Air Force on the Central Front has been extremely active recently. The Red Army Air Force team led by Zhevzhishvili has destroyed 39 enemy aircraft in the past few days. On one occasion, the team attacked an airfield and found no aircraft. It was then discovered that the enemy aircraft were hidden in the adjacent woods, so they were bombed twice in succession, destroying 10 enemy aircraft.

Germany Claims to Have Destroyed a Large Number of Soviet Aircraft

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th – According to responsible authorities here yesterday, 78 Soviet aircraft were lost on Tuesday, including 57 shot down in aerial combat and 14 destroyed on the ground. At the same time, a small squadron of German bombers bombed an important hydroelectric power plant, sluice gate, turbine factory, and transformer station north of Kandalaksha Bay in the White Sea. On the same night, German aircraft bombed factories and supply stations in Moscow, causing fires in several places.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th – It was revealed here last night that elite German bomber squadrons heavily attacked enemy artillery positions, fortifications, and railway stations in southern Ukraine. Explosions and large fires occurred everywhere. Photos taken by German reconnaissance aircraft show a large number of heavy artillery and war materials destroyed by German aircraft.

### Germany Claims Soviet Prisoners Exceed Two Million

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th – The German High Command announced today that in the three months since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the number of Soviet prisoners has reached over 2,200,000. It is noted that in World War I, Germany captured only 1,000,000 prisoners after two years of fighting against Russia, thus the previous record has already been broken.

### Revolution to Occur in France Within Four Months

Reuters, New York, 25th – Former French government envoy Le Roux has arrived in the United States. According to his prediction, a revolution will occur in France within four months. The recent arrest of Communists in France in retaliation for German soldiers being beaten will trigger the event and cannot be stopped.

### British Commander-in-Chief in India, Wavell, Flew to London to Discuss the Soviet Union and the Middle East Situation; Home Secretary Denies Preparing to Invade the Soviet Union

Reuters, London, 25th – General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, recently flew to London. After discussing matters with Prime Minister Churchill, Chief of the Imperial General Staff Dill, and other military officials, he has now returned to India. It is heard that the purpose of Wavell's trip was to discuss various issues arising from the situation in the Soviet Union and the Middle East.

United Press, London, 25th – Wavell's secret meetings with Dill, other cabinet members, and high-ranking military authorities coincide with German fears that they will reach the Caucasus oil fields in a short period of time. They also believe that Bulgaria poses a danger of attacking Turkey.

Reuters, London, 25th – Speculation in British newspapers that Imperial troops may be transported through Iran to the Soviet Union has taken on a new significance. General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, came here in August. Wavell also met with him in Egypt on his return flight to India. Wavell is said to have been responsible for establishing effective liaison with the Soviet Union and ensuring that all traffic through Iran is unimpeded.

United Press, Ankara, 25th – Reliable sources here stated yesterday that Bulgaria has evacuated Turkish people from their villages in Elhovo. The village is located on the Turkish border, near a military airfield. The report stated that after the evacuation of the Turkish people, the village was filled with ammunition, fuel, and other supplies.

Reuters, Berlin, 25th – The German official news agency, quoting Sofia, reported that the Bulgarian Home Secretary denied to foreign journalists the French rumor that Bulgaria would soon wage war against the Soviet Union, establish a protectorate on the Crimean Peninsula, control the Black Sea, and participate in the development of the Caucasus oil fields. It was claimed that Bulgaria has no aggressive intentions towards any country and has not been pressured by any party.

Haitong News Agency, Sofia, 25th – Bulgarian Home Secretary Gabrovski received foreign reporters and explained the domestic situation in Bulgaria. He stated that reports in British, American, and Soviet newspapers that Bulgaria is making large-scale preparations to attack the Soviet Union are completely untrue. Bulgaria has no aggressive ambitions towards the Soviet Union. Normal diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union have not been severed to this day. Another report indicating that Bulgaria has declared a state of emergency and is carrying out general mobilization is also an exaggeration. In order to prevent Soviet sabotage, Bulgaria has had to take some necessary precautionary measures and declare some wartime punishments, but it has not declared a state of emergency or carried out general mobilization. The internal situation in Bulgaria is extremely stable, and the people are extremely quiet. They have all decided to do their best to extinguish Bolshevism. He refused to disclose any details of the paratrooper incident, stating that an official announcement had already been issued regarding the matter, and an investigation is still in progress. It is inconvenient to elaborate at this time, but it is expected that details will be made public to all sectors soon.

TASS, New York, 25th – According to foreign military circles, Bulgaria has been actively preparing for war in the past ten days. Three new divisions of recruits have been mobilized in five days. Martial law has been declared in the Burgas and Varna districts. Foreign ships are not allowed to enter the two ports. All Greek and Yugoslav residents in Bulgaria have also been mobilized. At the same time, disturbances have occurred throughout Bulgaria. The government has closed 19 secondary schools suspected of communist propaganda. Two weeks ago, several houses were burned down near Plovdiv. Warehouses and large quantities of grain in two factories near Sofia were also burned down. The Bulgarian authorities, in view of the serious situation, have stationed a division in the country to maintain order. Due to frequent military transport, railway traffic has been suspended.

### Allied London Conference Passes Eden's Proposal; Each Country Drafts Post-War Economic Plans; Joint Cooperation Aims to Achieve Adjustment Objectives

Reuters, London, 25th – The history of a new world of freedom and peace wrote its first page yesterday at St. James's Palace in London. Representatives attending the Allied International Conference unanimously agreed to adopt the Atlantic Charter as the cornerstone of post-war policy. British Foreign Secretary Eden, as chairman, strongly advocated the need for all free countries to organize in a timely manner and use their resources for the transition from war to peace. He then put forward a motion, the full text of which is as follows: (1) The common purpose of the participants is to ensure that the necessary food supplies and goods are available to the countries liberated from Nazi oppression after the war. (2) The governments and authorities of the Allied countries have a responsibility to prepare for the economic needs of their own people. The plans they formulate should be adjusted in the spirit of joint cooperation among the Allied countries in order to achieve their common goals. (3) For the above-mentioned purposes, each of the Allied countries expresses its willingness to actively cooperate within its capabilities to prepare for the necessary actions. (4) Therefore, the governments and authorities of the Allied countries must each prepare a budget for their urgent needs, listing the types and quantities of food supplies and goods, and indicating the order of priority for the delivery of various supplies. The motion was unanimously passed by the assembly. When presenting this motion, Eden stated that the British government invited the governments and authorities of the Allied countries to hold this meeting in order to provide the necessary supplies to the occupied countries immediately after the withdrawal of German troops. The British government committee has already begun preliminary work on this, and the committee guided by the government's chief economic adviser, Lees-Smith, has also begun studying Europe's needs. Soviet Ambassador Maisky stated that all organizations and groups related to various governments should be composed of equal representatives from each country. Therefore, he suggested that all plans must first be submitted to various governments for consideration. Although he now supports the chairman's proposal, he reserves the right to propose some measures in accordance with this principle in the future. Eden replied that the organization and scope can be modified or expanded as needed. What we want is to carry out the work approved by this meeting. Representatives from Czechoslovakia, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland, Luxembourg, etc. then spoke one after another, expressing their agreement.

### German Submarines Attack British Convoy

Havas, Berlin, 25th – The High Command issued a battle report this morning stating that a British convoy was attacked by several of our submarines near the west coast of Africa. Eleven merchant ships in the convoy, totaling 78,000 tons, were all sunk by our submarines, despite being protected by several destroyers. Only one small ship escaped.

Reuters, London, 15th – A Naval Department communiqué stated that one enemy supply ship and one transport ship, each weighing approximately 1,500 tons, were torpedoed by British submarines in the central Mediterranean. The supply ship is thought to have sunk, and the transport ship caught fire and burned.

### Allied Forces in the Middle East Strengthen

International News Service, Cairo, 25th – The Axis powers are preparing to attack the Middle East. So far, a war in the region may break out soon. Reporters investigating the positions of the British and Allied forces have seen that their strength has been strengthened, enough to cope with future offensives. While the German army is unable to look eastward due to its attack on the Soviet Union, the Allied forces have been able to establish strong positions in Iraq and Iran. At the same time, the remnants of the Italian army in Eritrea and Abyssinia have been cleared. Therefore, elite troops from India and South Africa have been transferred to the Middle East. The island of Cyprus has become the maritime bulwark of the Allied forces in the Middle East. A large amount of American supplies arriving in the Middle East are stored on the island. More and more American observers, trainers, and technicians are coming here to serve, so it is common to hear American accents. Free French forces are also concentrated in various defense areas. The strength of their defense will be evident when the Axis powers reach out.

### Turkey Continues to Enlist Young People

Haitong News Agency, Istanbul, 25th

Turkish newspapers stated that Turkey's conscription of young people born in 1922 is a routine matter, regardless of whether they participate in the war.

### Results of Children's Tests at the Shanghai Children's Conservatory of Music

The Shanghai Children's Conservatory of Music is established for children who are gifted and want to pursue further studies in music. Anyone with special musical talent, regardless of poverty, can enroll for free. Many people have registered. Because individual testing is time-consuming, the conservatory has changed its methods and holds tests in stages. The results of the first batch of children's tests show that nine children are very musically talented, with Zhu Changping and Shi Zhongguang being the most outstanding. Zhu is nine years old and will receive a full scholarship, and Shi is six years old and will receive a half scholarship. It is heard that the second batch of children's tests is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. on the 28th of this month, still at the conservatory at No. 14 Yuyuan New Village.

### Cocoa Cup Charity Softball Tournament; Four Chinese Teams Hold Playoffs; Three Western Teams Decide to Withdraw

The Cocoa Cup Charity Softball Tournament has already held three preliminary games. There are two remaining games: North West Children vs. Portugal, and Jewish vs. Swedish. The Western teams, North West Children, Jewish, and Portugal, must wait for the decision of the Westerners' Association due to the association's charter. The West Union Executive Committee was originally scheduled to hold a regular meeting yesterday, but it has been postponed to next Tuesday due to unforeseen circumstances. The Cocoa Cup organizers have decided to treat the above three foreign teams as having withdrawn from the competition. Currently, in addition to the Dragon Team and the Golden Lion CGO, which advanced after winning in the preliminary round, Swedish also advanced without effort after the Jewish team withdrew. Therefore, the four teams, including the Dragon Team, will hold the playoffs. It is scheduled for this afternoon at 4:00 p.m. to have Qian Weilie and Wang Ruilong preside over the draw to arrange the playoff order. The playoffs will begin this Sunday (the 28th).

### Charity Basketball Tournament; Shanghai Star Takes the Lead

Blue White Also Decides to Participate in the Grand Event

The Paramount Sports Association, in order to raise scholarships, is separately donating to the News Daily's Loan Scholarship Fund, the Shen Daily's Scholarship Fund, and the Orphanage's Higher Education Savings Fund, and is holding a charity basketball对抗competition, inviting the strong teams Blue White and Shanghai Black to compete against Paramount separately. The tournament is scheduled to open next Wednesday. It is learned that the Shanghai Star has already agreed to participate, while the Blue White's response has been delayed due to the departure of key players Chen Bangzhen and Li Zude from Shanghai. Now, due to the urging of the organizers, Blue White has agreed to participate, but has requested that Shanghai Star take the lead first. Blue White will be able to participate in two weeks, as Chen and Li will have returned to Shanghai by then. In addition, Wang Nanqun, who recently arrived in Shanghai, as well as Bao Songyuan, Zhang Jinxuan, Fan Qingxian, Qiu Xiaoci and other strong players, have further enhanced the team's strength, making the charity performance even more enthusiastic. Therefore, the organizers will slightly adjust the schedule. In addition to the first game between Shanghai Star and Paramount, which is scheduled to open next Wednesday (October 1st), the second game is scheduled for the following Monday (6th), and the third game will be held on Double Ten Day (Friday). The three games between Blue White and Paramount will begin on the 12th or 14th of next month, so that the player problems of Blue White can be solved easily. Tickets for each game are divided into two types: ordinary tickets at 3 yuan and honorary tickets at 10 yuan. Pre-sales will begin this Sunday (the day after tomorrow). The organizers have also sent a letter to accountant Xu Shuizuo to voluntarily audit the number of tickets, check the ticket revenue, and verify the distribution figures to demonstrate great credibility.

### How to Study Today's Chinese Geography (4)

— Tan Lian

Tiexi Kang is most prosperous, with Mianning Rongjing and Hanyuan all being iron producing areas. They can produce four to five hundred tons of iron per month. The iron ore deposits in Huili County are particularly rich, and also contain copper and zinc. The other seven counties of the former Ning Prefecture all produce gold nuggets and gold sand. Gulang, Zhangye, Linze, Gaotai, Jiuquan and other counties in Gansu province produce 20,000 taels of gold annually. Coal is produced in Sichuan, Kang, and Guizhou provinces. As for petroleum, the oil wells outside Jiayuguan in Gansu can produce 60,000 gallons per month. With new machinery installed, this can be increased to 450,000 gallons. The tung oil production of Sichuan province in 1936 was only 150,000 piculs, which increased to 350,000 piculs in 1938. Currently, Sichuan accounts for 40% of the total national tung oil exports, with most of it being shipped to the United States. The Sichuan Agricultural Improvement Institute and the Foreign Trade Commission implemented a ten-year plan last year to increase tung oil production in Sichuan province from 400,000 piculs per year to 1 million piculs. The Foreign Trade Commission is also cooperating with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to implement a five-year plan in Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces to increase tung oil production in each province to 650,000 piculs per year. The gasoline refined from crude oil is of extremely high quality. According to tests conducted by the Northwest Highway Bureau, it has one-third greater mileage than Soviet gasoline (Soviet oil runs 6 kilometers per gallon, while Gansu oil can run 9 kilometers per gallon). Alcohol production has also increased from 920,000 gallons to 580,000 gallons per day. Factories have surged since the war. According to recent surveys, the southwestern and northwestern provinces have a total of 361 chemical factories, 313 mechanical factories, 294 spinning mills, 93 metallurgical factories, 48 power plants, and 269 other factories. These are the agricultural, mineral, and industrial aspects that should be studied.

The above sections are just a few examples based on my limited knowledge, for those studying geography to collect and supplement at any time and any place. (End)

Commercial News

### Yarn and Cotton: Overnight Rumors Prove False, Mill Order Buying Regains Momentum, Southern Seas Demand Still Improves: Blended Yarn Up 10-20 Yuan

The yarn market, which had plummeted the day before yesterday afternoon, rebounded yesterday. This was because the rumored incident turned out to be unfounded. Hong Kong traders continued to procure yarn with strong buying interest, and the price of various brands of yarn rose uniformly, increasing by about 10-20 yuan compared to the previous day. As a result, weakened morale was revived, and the market gradually improved. 20s Double Horse was usually 1764 yuan, with a low price of 1746 yuan. The market became tighter after the afternoon opening due to improved demand in Southeast Asia. Several factories sold 600 bales of 20s Double Horse at prices ranging from 1755 yuan to 1770 yuan, boosting buyer morale. The market rose from 1766 yuan to 1771 yuan. After fluctuating at this price for some time, a sudden rumor spread in the market near the close, and selling orders appeared on the trading floor, causing a sharp drop to 1755 yuan. However, buyers flocked in at the low price, and it rebounded to close at 1765 yuan. Today, 1505 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened in the morning due to the rebound after the close of the previous day, and a portion of the market absorbed short positions, opening 10 yuan higher at 1795 yuan. However, there were still plenty of sellers, who were battered the previous day. It soon loosened to 1748 yuan. News then spread that Guangdong traders were continuously seeking spot yarn in the market, and prices gradually rose, restoring confidence and pushing the market back up to close at 1764 yuan. According to statistics, 10,445 bales were traded in the morning. The amount purchased by each trading group is listed below:

Hong Kong 400 Southeast Asia 4
Domestic Traders 10,000 Statistics 10,445

The recent turbulent spot cotton yarn market, with its ups and downs, has frightened people. In reality, both bulls and bears have different opinions. Sellers believe that the international situation is still unpredictable, considering the yarn price floor already high, and tend to sell. As for the buyers, one reason is that the price of various brands of yarn is gradually increasing and Hong Kong traders have strong demand. The second reason is that cotton prices are high. While applications for purchasing foreign cotton are still pending, the price of 20s raw cotton must be sold at 450-480 yuan per dan. As a result, cost is a factor, and factories are unwilling to sell. Therefore, buying factory orders in the market is a good plan. It is imaginable how fierce the competition between bulls and bears will be, and it is unknown who will win.

Golden Double Horse Futures Market Situation: The situation turned stable, with extremely narrow fluctuations, with a difference of only 6-7 yuan throughout the day. Although ocean cotton rose again and factory orders were over 10 yuan higher at the opening in the morning, recent contracts had not suffered any impact due to the previous day's early close, so buyers were still willing to accept. However, there was no strength to pull it up again, so it opened at 1662 yuan, down 6 yuan. November contracts opened at 678 yuan, also down 5 yuan. However, long-term contracts were absorbed at low prices, opening at 1714 yuan, up 4 yuan. Afterwards, factory orders did indeed rise again, but failed to excite futures yarn sentiment. The volatile factory orders made speculators like frightened birds, and they dared not follow, resulting in sluggish trading and sideways movement. In the afternoon, because spot prices and the exchange still advanced, sentiment was more active, with some short-covering and long liquidation. The market was slightly firmer, with October rising to 1669 yuan, November rising to 682 yuan, and December rising to 1717 yuan. However, general sellers suddenly came out to sell at high prices, resulting in a setback of two to three yuan. As a result, near-month contracts closed at 1666.5 yuan, down 1.5 yuan, November contracts at 1679 yuan, also down 4 yuan, and December contracts at 1714 yuan, up 4 yuan alone. The price movements are listed in the table below.

### Yarn Market Tight, Cotton Prices Even Higher

The spot cotton situation remains tight. General opinion is that inventory is becoming increasingly thin, making varieties such as India-flower, and Omra, more rare and expensive, because the problem of future orders cannot be solved effectively. Therefore, the yarn market is tight and the cotton prices are firm. Conversely, cotton prices are not moving.

American type Pengjiahbu 100 bales No. 549.0 each
Also 200 bales No. 550.0 each

British type Pengjiahbu 100 bales No. 545.0 each
Also 100 bales No. 549.0 each

Secondary Pengjiahbu 93 bales No. 495.0 each

Bailuo gone 200 bales No. 440.0 each

Eggplant 200 bales No. 500.0 each

Omra 100 bales No. 380.0 each

Excellent grade 100 bales No. 372.0 each

New York cotton market rose first due to buying in New Orleans futures and poor weather reports, causing strong short covering, and then fell slightly due to some profit taking. Yesterday's closing prices were about 12-13 points higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market fell due to a large amount of long liquidation and cotton merchant hedging. As a result, closing prices fell by 5-10 rupees each. It is also predicted that today's opening market price will rise by half a rupee.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading market situation is very strong due to the firm rise in cotton yarn, and various parties are buying very heavily. The spot cotton trading is quite prosperous.

It is predicted that since direct orders cannot be developed temporarily, various parties can only focus on sourcing spot cotton.

### Food: How Can Rice Prices Stay High?

Imported rice has risen for several days in a row, but suddenly saw a decline yesterday. This is because the stock is considered sufficient, and the source will be cut off. As rice prices have repeatedly increased, people are inevitably wary. It is said that 58-59,000 bags of government-controlled rice will arrive soon, and the rice will still be allocated to rice shops for public sale as usual. It is said that the selling price will only be 125 yuan, in order to reduce the retail price to below 110 yuan. The market was shocked when this news was released, especially the speculators in the warehouses. The arbitrage business was also defeated, and the situation became soft, and the price gradually fell. At the lowest point, Yin Zhan Xiaojiao actually fell below the 110 yuan mark, opening at 109.5 yuan, while Wai Zhan opened at 109 yuan. Afterwards, there was slight recovery due to bargain hunting, returning to the original point. The Yin Zhan closed at 110.05 yuan, and the Wai Zhan closed at 110 yuan, a drop of about 2 yuan compared to the previous day. Among other varieties, except for broken pointed rice, which was active due to the activities of the Hangzhou and Shaoxing traders, there was no change. It opened high at 85-86 yuan, then fell to 82-83 yuan. The rest of the situation was similar to that of Xiaojiao, with a drop of 1-2 yuan. The price of No. 1 Xigui high quality rice was 124-123.5 yuan, Dashibai was 122-121.5 yuan, Zhongguan was 110 yuan, No. 2 Gaobai was 113.5 yuan, followed by 108.5 yuan, No. 2 Gailuo Gao was 111-110 yuan, followed by 107.5 yuan, Mindang milled rice was 121-120 yuan, ordinary rice was 118.5 yuan, Zhongguan Yuanbai was 116-114.5 yuan, and Tokyo pointed tip special grade was 109 yuan, followed by 104 yuan.

Thick and thin Japonica rice prices were also weak due to the influence of foreign rice. Nanhai Zaopo was discounted by 2 yuan, opening at 147-145 yuan. Pudong Xinjiang was not much different because there was not much stock in the market, only dropping by 1 yuan, opening at 152.5-151.5 yuan. As for thick and broken rice, no transactions were heard due to lack of stock.

Sparse appetite for glutinous rice continued to move, and the buying was very tight. Therefore, the sellers could not raise prices, and the result was flat without any changes. Hong Kong special grade opened at 135-136 yuan, Da Shi Bai opened at 133-134 yuan, Zhongguan opened at 131 yuan, and Nuoluo opened at 119 yuan.

Foreign rice was transferred to Qingdao. The Taikoo Company's Poyang ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday. In addition to the original large batch of imported rice and sugar being transported to Qingdao, Shanghai also loaded an additional 1,400 bags of imported rice to be transported to Qingdao. (Zu)

### Imported Flour Finally Settled

Imported flour initially stabilized and then returned to settle. The market saw slight fluctuations in the midst of stability. Because there are no new developments in the international situation, both bulls and bears are at a loss. If we consider the abundant inventory and uninterrupted sources, the market should follow the lead of imported rice and fall slightly. However, current retail demand is still active, and major holders are unwilling to sell cheaply. Since the deteriorating relations between the United States and Germany and Japan have not been resolved, the source of American flour is sometimes feared to be blocked, so holders of flour are even more reluctant to sell at a discount. And general speculators are always taking advantage of small opportunities to buy, so the result is that flour is relatively firm, and other varieties are also stable. Cannon brand went from 33.7 yuan to 33.85 yuan, and was suppressed by 0.1 yuan in the evening. Xiangwu was 33.34 yuan, Five Swallow was 23.35 yuan, Golden was 30 yuan, Flower Bird was 33.3 yuan, Jinlong West Warehouse was 31.5-31.78 yuan, and East Warehouse was 32.15-32.3 yuan, all slightly higher than the previous evening. About 20,000 bags were still traded. Bran is in short supply, and local bran was 33.67 yuan, also more popular than the previous market.

### Oil Market: Raw Soybean Oil Sold off Stockpiles

Soybeans Scattered Sales Active

Yesterday's edible oil market, raw soybean oil due to the influence of Lianyou's (a brand) upcoming arrival in Shanghai, stockpiles suddenly had a large sale, and the market was mixed, seeing alternating increases and decreases. Rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil futures, long positions, seeing the unfavorable environment, have begun to secretly liquidate positions, so the price fell by 3-4 yuan. The overall market sold 110 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 1,000 cans of Yanting raw oil, 1,730 cans of soybean oil, 30 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 110 pieces of Yantai soybean oil, over 7,000 dan of Dayou factory's processed oil futures, over 2,000 barrels of Rihua factory's rapeseed oil futures, and 50 barrels of Taishan factory's rapeseed oil. (Prices detailed in the market price section.)

Yesterday, the scattered sales of soybeans on this street were quite active. The sellers tried to raise prices, so the market trend was firm. It is estimated that 300 bags of Guide yellow soybeans, 200 bags of Jining yellow soybeans, 2 trucks of Changzhou Niu Pi Qing, and 1 truck of Niu Pi Huang were sold. Prices were about 0.5 yuan higher than before. Today, 500 bags of soybeans will be transported to Hong Kong.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange and Tobacco Settlement Approved for US$400,000-500,000

Yesterday's foreign exchange market, both the Central Bank and HSBC quotes were flat. HSBC's small counter saw a large number of legitimate commercial settlements for import and export. It is rumored that the Exchange Stabilization Fund telegraphed Shanghai to approve US$400,000-500,000 for tobacco import settlements, at a price of 5.3125 yuan. In the black market for British and American exchange, many Chinese merchants continued to transact, selling to Chinese firms and foreign banks within the fourteen companies, at a price of 4.875 yuan. The activity of importers who are generally not allowed to apply is weakening, so the American exchange rate firmed to 4.75 yuan for purchase, up 0.0625 from the previous day. The British pound rate was 2.8125.

Hong Kong, 15th (Thursday) Telegraph: The foreign exchange market opened sluggishly this morning, with no changes in any exchange rate.

Tianjin, 15th (Thursday) Telegraph: The foreign exchange market opened flat this morning. London and New York telegraphic exchange rates were unchanged. Shanghai exchange rate rose 1 yuan, to 87 yuan. The black market rate for joint banknotes rose 0.79, to 47 yuan.

### U.S. Dollar Notes Rise Again

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw stable prices for British and American gold pounds, British gold notes fell by 1 yuan and retreated to 55 yuan in the evening market, U.S. dollar notes trended higher again and rose back to 22.25 yuan in the evening market, up 0.55 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes saw balanced supply and demand and the market price was stable. Japanese gold notes continued to trend higher and rose to 2.38 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes were slightly weaker and retreated to 2.06 yuan in the evening market.

### Gold Price Unable to Rise

Yesterday's gold market saw small fluctuations for the October contract, with a difference of only 2 yuan. The price finally settled at a decrease of 2 yuan, with about 200-300 taels of transactions, at a price of about 6,891 yuan. The spot price rose first and then fell back, with an uncertain trend. It rose 35 yuan immediately under the buying momentum of the spot gold shops after breaking through the 9,100 yuan mark, when Shihe purchased 60 taels from Wanfeng and 10 taels from Deshun, for 9,110 yuan, and then Chengji purchased 50 taels, rising to 9,120 yuan. Xianghe also came to purchase, rising more vigorously, Shihe purchased 30 taels from Lianxing, for 9,130 yuan, and then Yili, Tianyuan, Wanfeng, Hesheng, Hongqingyong and others purchased 110 taels, rising to 9,150 yuan, Suifu sold 10 taels of Shihe, doing small business to 9,140 yuan, Xianghe purchased over 200 taels from Lianyu, Tianyuan, Chengda, Yongcheng, Chengji, Defu, and others, and then rose to 9,150 yuan. At around 11 o'clock, Defu sold again, retreating to 9,120 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, Tongkang Yong purchased 20 taels from Xianghe for 9,110 yuan, and then purchased 30 taels from Chengda, and 10 taels from Fengxiang and Heji for 9,100 yuan, and then it could not hold on, Zhongxing sold 20 taels of Xiangxingyong, retreating to 9,080 yuan, and finally a certain jewelry store sold 20 taels of Xianghe, 9,070 yuan, a settlement price decreasing 5 yuan from the previous day's closing price. On that day, there was a difference of eighty yuan, and about seven hundred taels were traded. The price of gold for the brand of Jinmen Jewelry Store was 9,100 yuan for selling and 100 yuan lower than selling for purchasing, and the price of ornamental gold also rose by 10 yuan first and then returned to flat, still 930 yuan.

Futures Lifeless

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened at 6,892 yuan at 9:15, the same as the previous day's closing price. Hengji sold 50 taels, retreating to 6,890 yuan, and because Xiangxingyong and Tianyuan absorbed it, it closed at 6,891 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, Tianyuan purchased 10 taels of Jufengyong, for 6,892 yuan, up 1 yuan, and then went down again, Tianyuan sold 20 taels of Xiangxingyong again, and closed at 6,890 yuan at 3:30, down 2 yuan compared to the previous day. The difference between the high and low of the day was also only 2 yuan.

### Securities: Bond Market Meanders

The over-the-counter market for public bonds was unusually sluggish yesterday, with very small fluctuations. Types A and B were relatively weak, and trading still showed no sign of improving. Although numbers 31 and Tongkang continued to sell, there were very few buyers, but they were also unwilling to lower prices, so it became even more meandering. The Sichuan traders continued to sell constantly, and the longs only waited in ambush, so there were no major sellers, and the trend will probably be stagnant for a while. In the morning, numbers 31 and Tongkang sold, and Renchang and Yitai bought. Type C was highest at 1.5 yuan and lowest at 0.3 yuan. In the afternoon, numbers 31 and Tongkang were still sellers, and Runli and Hengkang bought. Type C was highest at 1.45 yuan and lowest at 0.3 yuan. Types A and B showed signs of weakness. Market prices for types D and E were unchanged, and the rest were slightly lower by 0.05 to 0.25 yuan. Transactions were around 800,000 yuan. The brief listing is listed below.

The stock trading saw 150 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company traded, at a price of 31.5 yuan. Other various stocks also saw unusually high prices. This period can be said to be the time for stocks.

Although the stock market of various industries was active, price fluctuations were very slight. Huizhong Bank Company's stock can be considered an exception, with a low price of only 1.82 yuan and a high price reaching 2.5 yuan, and the closing price was 2.3 yuan, an increase of more than 0.4 yuan compared to the previous settlement. Rubber stocks saw very few transactions.

British Steel Industry Limited is scheduled to distribute an interim dividend for 1941 on October 21, at 2 yuan per share in national currency.

London, 14th (Wednesday) Telegraph: Today's market for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks was stagnant, and there were no changes in prices.

### Textiles: Overcoats More Expensive Than Gold

Overcoats have become the only speculative product, and the stockpilers are rampant and unparalleled. Trading companies don't reveal their inventory; there are only entries, no exits, and the price is more expensive than gold. Yesterday, Shililuo overcoats were wholesale sold at 150 yuan per yard, Meifeng solid colors at 90 yuan, Kai Shui Mi at 125 yuan, Fatai Kai Shui Mi at 200 yuan, No. 1 Kao Hua overcoats at 240 yuan, No. 2 at 160 yuan, Youyi Da Guan Tu Kao Hua overcoats at 240 yuan, Japanese Yin Qiang overcoats at 80 yuan, Japanese Shanghai Textile's Yuanchang overcoats at 45 yuan, Polish overcoats at No. 1 110 yuan, No. 2 90 yuan, No. 3 66 yuan, and No. 4 48 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Sugar May Rise Again, 30,000 Bags of Dutch Sugar Arrive

Yesterday's tight sugar market did not weaken, and continued to move upwards, rising from a few cents to a few yuan. The association's current price of spot 24 coarse white sugar was 137.85 yuan for September arrivals, up 0.8 yuan, 136.873 yuan for August, up 0.5 yuan, 136.47 yuan for July, and 136.65 yuan for June, all up 0.7 yuan. Hong Kong cargo was 127.68 yuan, up 1.3 yuan, Dutch red spot cargo was 123.5 yuan, up 1 yuan, Hong Kong cargo was 121 yuan, Futures coarse white sugar was 137.0-6.1-6.25 yuan for September 30, up 0.85 yuan, 137.1-4.5-6 yuan for Double Tenth Festival, up 0.9 yuan. Although trading was not strong, the firm state remained unchanged, and there may be a further increase.

A large amount of Dutch sugar has arrived in Shanghai again. The Java Mail Steamship Company's Zhibade arrived at port the day before yesterday (the 24th) in the evening, transporting 3,000 tons of sugar, about 30,000 bags, from Java, docking at the Pudong Lan Yanchong pier for unloading. Today, 1,500 bags of sugar will be loaded onto the Taikoo Poyang ship for transport to Qingdao. (Zu)

### Seafood: Dried Mussels and Pepper Prices Decline

The price of imported dried mussels has also declined recently. Yesterday's market saw a decrease in rushed mussels to 300 yuan, Western Da Dan (large mussels) to 270 yuan, and Western Zhong Dan (medium mussels) to 250 yuan.

The price of pepper also declined because the production price for orders was cheaper and more dramatic, black pepper was 305 yuan, and white pepper was 220 yuan.

### Metals: American Strip Iron Stands Out

The tinplate and galvanized iron that have been circulating in the market for a long time have recently seen soaring prices, coupled with a lack of spot goods, purchasers have the worry of having no goods to buy, therefore the off-brand narrow strip iron took the opportunity to rise, its price is much lower than the above-mentioned two genuine goods, therefore it is the purpose of purchase by can factories, toy factories and printing factories on this street, and there are many transactions in recent days, and the industry who holds this goods has seen high sentiment, and there are not many spot goods in the market, so the market is particularly firm. For example, all colors of 2-inch or larger iron were sold at 650 yuan per hundred pounds, while larger sizes were temporarily impossible to find, which also shows one aspect of its circulation.

### Serious Economic Discussion

— Feng Liuying

Hoarding (1)

Since the war, prices have repeatedly increased, and there is still no end in sight. Of course, it is also affected by controlled sources, poor cargo transportation, imbalanced supply and demand, exorbitant taxes and levies, and increasingly high commodity costs, as well as the gradual reduction of the black exchange rate. However, the increasingly rampant hoarding has led prices to break free from the monetary shackles and rise indefinitely. It is also the most important factor.

Hoarding is a natural function of commerce and an exploitative means for the rich to deceive the poor, which is not surprising. However, it is condemned by the world precisely because of its insatiable greed, desperately absorbing goods and constantly raising prices, making it difficult for the masses to breathe and survive, even abandoning wives and children, killing infants and cooking them in order to survive, and other outrageous and immoral acts. These inhumane events are caused by the selfish intentions of a few powerful people. However, with a finite life, pursuing infinite desires, only enjoying temporary pleasure, and secretly committing endless sins, reflecting on oneself in the quiet night, one knows why one must work so hard for profit.

People mostly hoard, but do not investigate the origin of hoarding. I have never hoarded, but now I want to talk about hoarding. Wouldn't that make people think I am fond of scratching an itch from outside my boot? Although I am incompetent, I might as well talk about it.

Hoarding is commonly written as 囤积 (tún jī), but I think 屯积 (tún jī) is correct. The 囤 (dùn) is what is needed, a woven bamboo container formed into a strip, circled and closed, used to store rice. There are also straw containers woven with rice straw that are three or four feet in diameter and about one foot high, piled up to store rice. Whether made of bamboo or straw, they are all called rice containers. 囤 is a noun, similar to 囷 (qūn). Looking at its shape, one can also know its meaning. Inside a circle, rice is stored. Is it not a container for storing rice? The character 囷 is ancient, and the character 囤 is later. 囤 is composed of 囗 (wéi, enclosure) and 屯 (tún), derived from the character 屯, because it is a container for hoarding, so a circle is added outside of 屯 to show that it is a container; also, because its function is to 屯, its meaning still comes from 屯.

屯积 is a type of action. If 囤 is used, it does not move. 屯 means to gather; 积 means to store; to gather goods and store them is the original meaning of 屯积. The original pronunciation of 屯 is tún, but it is commonly pronounced in the rising tone like 豚 (tún). It can also be pronounced as dùn, so in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, 屯 is often pronounced as dùn and called 顿货 (dùn huò, hoarded goods).

### Shanghai Goods Transport to Free Areas Prohibited: Economic Warfare Begins; Overseas Ports Can Still Transport Internally; Increased Re-export Tax Has No Impact on Trade

The Jianghai Customs issued Announcement No. 33 yesterday regarding the prohibition of goods destined for free areas, stating: "From September 25, 1941, all goods are prohibited from being transported from Shanghai to any ports and cities in non-occupied areas. However, goods required for ship navigation are not subject to this prohibition. Please take note and comply accordingly." This announcement was issued under the authority of the Japanese Tax Commissioner of the General Affairs Department of the Customs.

Overseas Ports Still Free

The customs announcement did not specify which areas were considered "non-occupied areas." However, sources claim that the purpose of this measure is to completely prohibit the transportation of any goods to the free areas of China. Hong Kong, Rangoon, Manila, and overseas ports are still free to export, but this should not conflict with the Japanese embargo measures taken in retaliation for the freezing of Sino-Japanese funds by the United States and Britain. In other words, except for the dozen or so types of goods specified by the Japanese, exports to foreign countries are not within the scope of the prohibition. Although the transport of goods to Hong Kong is not prohibited, a double re-export tax will be imposed to show restriction. However, future developments are still difficult to predict.

Internal Transport of Goods Not Expected to Be Interrupted

Since the port of Hong Kong is not subject to the embargo, goods can still be re-exported to the free areas via Hong Kong. In this regard, there is no significant impact on trade with the free areas, only an increase in the re-export tax. On the other hand, the internal transport of goods from Shanghai via the seaports of Zhejiang and Fujian will likely be cut off. Currently, shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang, and Shanghai and Fujian has been interrupted. In reality, goods can still find ways to be transported into the free areas through these two routes. Therefore, this prohibition of goods being transported to non-occupied areas probably refers to goods transferred to the inland areas via Zhejiang and Fujian. The impact will be limited to exports to Zhejiang and Fujian. However, exports from Shanghai to [blank space in original] will inevitably increase in the future. Therefore, the prohibition of goods going to free areas will ultimately be in vain, and trade between Shanghai and the mainland will not suffer adverse effects.

Retaliation Against the Stabilization Fund

According to informed business sources, the Japanese-instructed announcement of the embargo on goods destined for the mainland is actually a retaliatory measure against the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee. The Stabilization Fund prohibits Chinese funds from flowing from Hong Kong into occupied areas and Shanghai. The Stabilization Fund Committee, in order to maintain trade with allied nations in Shanghai, decided to provide foreign exchange at a rate of 5.34375 US dollars and 3.1875 British pounds. This move is the essence of the asset freeze and is undoubtedly a severe blow to Japanese commerce. At the same time, it is also making every effort to prevent Chinese funds from flowing into occupied areas, including Shanghai. Therefore, the Japanese have banned the transport of goods to free areas as retaliation. This is evidence that China, the United States, and Britain have launched a fierce economic war against Japan.

Spot Yarn Sales Remain Strong

The embargo will have a significant impact on Chinese, British, and American cotton spinning mills, as the transport of cotton cloth and cotton yarn to the mainland will encounter difficulties. However, Japanese cotton mills will not be affected at all because Japanese goods have long been prohibited from being transported to non-occupied areas. Therefore, at the beginning of the embargo announcement, the market price of cotton yarn plummeted. This was actually caused by speculators taking advantage of the situation. However, from yesterday onwards, the ban on the export of green cotton yarn to non-occupied areas has had no impact on actual sales (the Hong Kong route is open), and sporadic purchases by Hong Kong businesses have not stopped. Therefore, the spot yarn market price rose again yesterday.

### British Community Annual Meeting to Discuss Coal Prices, Rent, and Ticket Scalping

The British Residents Association, at its annual meeting decided on Tuesday, will convene a general meeting on November 7, to be held at the Race Course on Jing'an Temple Road. All British residents are expected to attend before 5:30 PM that afternoon. According to association sources, the general meeting will discuss many issues, with particular emphasis on the increase in the price of coal and the "scalping" of tickets by conductors on all trams, buses, and trolleybuses in the Public Concession. After discussion, recommendations will be submitted to the relevant authorities for appropriate measures to eradicate and prevent these issues. The increase in rent will also be a central issue for discussion at the meeting.

### Japanese Acknowledge Chinese Aircraft Bombed Yueyang

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that a Japanese army information officer here admitted today (the 25th) that Chinese bombers flew to Yueyang, the headquarters of the Japanese army in the Northern Hunan campaign, on Tuesday and dropped bombs. It is reported that the Chinese bombers flew extremely high over Yueyang, making them almost invisible from the ground. Two aircraft dropped two large bombs.

### Search in the Central District Not Yet Lifted

The Public Concession police have been conducting searches within the Concession since Monday of this week, and the situation became even more tense yesterday. Inspection teams were densely deployed in the central district of Guan City. All passers-by, regardless of who they are, must undergo strict searches. It is reported that detectives are also stationed along Nanjing Road, and all Chinese merchant hotels have been subjected to strict searches. It is said that a number of suspects have been arrested so far. This measure is expected to continue to be implemented in the short term.

### Special Tax on Business Premises to Be Levied Starting Next Year; Uniform Rate of 8% with No Distinctions

The Public Concession Council's Roads Committee held its first meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd regarding the issue of levying a special property tax on business premises, and passed it in principle. On the afternoon of the 24th, the Committee held its second meeting in the Council Chamber to continue discussing the matter and submitted the Council's proposed collection method and tax rate for review. The first proposal classified business premises such as exchanges as Category A, and other general business premises as Category B, with tax collection handled according to category. The second proposal was to levy a uniform tax regardless of category. After discussing the two proposals, it was considered that distinguishing between categories in the first proposal would inevitably lead to considerable difficulties in procedure, and that the first proposal, which did not distinguish between categories and levied a uniform tax on various business premises, was more convenient. Therefore, it was decided to cancel the distinction between Categories A and B, and to implement the second proposal in practice. As for the tax rate, it was also decided to levy a special property tax of 8% on the assessed value of the premises, and it was decided that this new tax would be implemented from January next year. It is heard that during the discussion, a comparison was made between the income from classified taxation and uniform taxation. The result was that uniform taxation would only reduce revenue by approximately 13,000 yuan per year compared to classified taxation. Therefore, the above decision was made.

### Foreign Exchange Suspension for Film Rental Fees Anxieties in First-Run Cinemas Propose to Temporarily Deposit Rental Fees in Designated Banks Rumors of Sending Representatives to Hong Kong to Request Foreign Exchange

Most of the films shown in Shanghai's major cinemas come from Europe and the United States, with American films being the main source. German films have completely disappeared since the European War. Recently, in order to prevent opportunism and disrupt the financial market, the central government, after cracking down on the black market for foreign exchange, strictly enforced measures to prohibit the settlement of foreign exchange. Foreign film merchants will no longer be able to remit rental fees out of China after the films are shipped to China.

Annual Rental Fees Approximately 7 Million

It is estimated that American films publicly screened in Shanghai each year have a rental fee of approximately US$350,000 (equivalent to over 7 million legal currency). Recently, more than ten first-run cinemas in the city that exclusively screen Western films have relied on American films to survive. If American film companies actually implement a ban on films being shipped to Shanghai, these cinemas will be forced to close. According to a reporter from Dagong News Agency, after the Stabilization Fund planned the above rules, the Shanghai representatives of American film merchants informed the cinemas that if the suspension of foreign exchange supply is implemented, it will be difficult for new films to be shipped to China.

Shanghai and Hong Kong Cinemas Jointly Send Telegrams to Request

Therefore, cinemas in Shanghai and Hong Kong that exclusively screen Western films jointly sent telegrams to American companies, requesting the continued supply of new films. Regarding rental fees, if they cannot be remitted to the United States, the rental fees will be deposited in designated banks in Shanghai and Hong Kong at the prevailing exchange rate. Once the restrictions are lifted, the remittance will be made accordingly. Whether American film companies will agree to this approach is still unknown, as no reply has been received in Shanghai. If rejected, in order to maintain their business and the livelihoods of their employees, cinemas that exclusively screen Western films will temporarily transition to domestic films. Therefore, various Chinese film companies in the city are currently planning to improve production in order to take advantage of this opportunity, revitalize domestic films, and indirectly recover huge lost profits.

Cinema Owners Meet to Discuss Increasing Ticket Prices

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that reliable sources say that cinema ticket prices in the city are expected to increase by about 25% starting from the beginning of October. It is expected that cinema owners will meet in the next day or two to make a final decision on the price increase. The new films currently available in Shanghai are sufficient for screenings for the next few months. At the same time, the Shanghai Film Merchants Association and the Hong Kong Stabilization Fund are currently in discussions. The Film Merchants Association may send a representative to Hong Kong to resolve the issue of foreign exchange settlement for film rental fees.

### Cargo on the Gold Prince Ship Confiscated No Hope for Release

The British ship "Gold Prince" was loaded with a large batch of piece goods, yarn, and sundry goods in Shanghai, intending to transport them to Wenzhou. The secret was discovered, and the Japanese Maritime Gendarmerie intercepted the ship before it set sail. For the past twenty days, it has been under surveillance at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong. It is reported that as a result of the Japanese search of the ship, in addition to passengers admitting to going to Wenzhou, many permits to sail to Wenzhou were also found. Recently, many pieces of grass-green cotton cloth were found in the loaded piece goods, which aroused further suspicion from the Japanese. It is now learned that all the cargo on the ship has been confiscated. Yesterday, the Japanese sent barges to unload the cargo from the ship and transported it to the Japanese naval warehouse for storage, effectively confiscating it. Although the cargo has been confiscated, there is still no hope for the ship's release.

### French Utility Tram Cars Increase Prices Again Effective October 1

Public utilities in the French Concession of this city, including electricity (lighting, heating), tap water, and public trams, trolleybuses, and buses, had previously been requested by the French Water and Electricity Company to increase fees with approval from the French Municipal Council in July of this year, which went into effect on July 31. Now, after just two months, the company has notified all utility users and public transportation passengers in the Concession that new prices will be implemented from October 1 of this year. From now on, citizens in the Concession will have an even heavier burden. The small electricity price increase is estimated at 6 cents per kilowatt-hour for lighting, 3.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for power under 10 horsepower, 3.8 cents per kilowatt-hour for power over 10 horsepower, 7 cents per kilowatt-hour for electric heating, and 14 cents per cubic meter for tap water. The revised price list for trams, trolleybuses, and buses will be displayed in each vehicle at that time. It is rumored that the increase will be about 20%.

### French Far East Fleet Flagship Leaves Japan After Repairs

The French Far East Fleet flagship "Lamotte-Picquet" (7,880 tons), after leaving Shanghai and being stationed in Vietnam, recently sailed to Japan for repairs. It is now learned that the ship will leave Japan tomorrow (the 27th), commanded by Rear Admiral de la Motte, Commander of the Far East Fleet, and sail to Vietnam. If time permits, it may come to Shanghai for a brief stop.

### President Pierce Scheduled to Arrive Sunday Evening

The American President Lines' "President Pierce" has resumed its voyage from the United States, via Luzon and Hong Kong, and is returning to the United States via Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to arrive the day before yesterday, but was not seen entering the port as of yesterday. According to foreign shipping industry sources, the postal ship has been slightly delayed in the South Seas. It is now learned that it should arrive in port on Sunday evening (the 28th). It is scheduled to berth at buoys 13 and 14, stay in Shanghai for one day, and leave Shanghai for the United States at dawn on the 30th.

### Zhang Ruogu, Editor of the Sino-American Daily, Arrested

Mr. Zhang Ruogu, editor of the Sino-American Daily, was suddenly arrested by Japanese personnel and French police officers at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lubin in the French Concession at 1 PM the day before yesterday when he got off a No. 21 public bus. He was taken to the Central Police Station on Avenue Edward VII for questioning. It is reported that several Japanese military police were present during the questioning. Later, at 5 PM, he was handed over to the Japanese authorities by the police station and taken to Hongkou. After Mr. Zhang was detained at the police station, the newspaper heard the news and tried to rescue him in various ways. It is known that Mr. Zhang studied in Belgium, obtained a degree, and returned to China. He has held positions in the press for many years. Later, when the Sino-American Daily was founded, he responded to the invitation and joined the newspaper to edit the supplement "Jina."

On the day before yesterday, Mr. Zhang returned home for dinner. Unexpectedly, when he got off the bus at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lubin, he was suddenly arrested by the police. Subsequently, Japanese and French personnel searched Mr. Zhang's residence. Mr. Zhang is a pure journalist, and the reason for his sudden arrest is unknown.

### Songjiang Red Cross Branch Calls for Aid in Medicine and Treatment

Since the weather has been abnormal this summer and autumn, with irregular temperatures, local townships and towns in Songjiang have been experiencing prevalent seasonal diseases, especially dysentery and malaria. The general public already finds it difficult to maintain their livelihoods. Once they fall ill, they have no remaining resources to seek medical treatment, causing many poor and sick people to suffer in silence, unable to seek treatment. This is a very pitiful situation. Now, Zhou, the director of the Shanghai office of the Songjiang Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, has sent letters to various charitable organizations in Shanghai, such as the United Relief Association of Shanghai Charitable Organizations, the Chinese Jisheng Association, and the Chinese Moral Society, requesting them to quickly allocate medicines for distribution to various townships to provide relief.

### Rotary Club Collects Toys to Donate to Impoverished Children

It is said that the target for toy collection is a minimum of 10,000 toys. The scope of collection includes all kinds of books and toys, regardless of whether they are new or old, are welcome. This is because the repair shop is capable of repairing, painting, and renovating broken toys. Books are also being bound. This year's toy repair shop is still located at the Ha Ning Foreign Firm. According to the situation of impoverished children this year, the situation is even worse. It is hoped that all sectors of society will provide enthusiastic assistance. Anyone willing to help can send them to Matti at 640 Route Cardinal Foch, or call 13015 Marseille Wu and someone will be sent to collect them.

### Xiang Dongchuan Dies Unnaturally; Fellow Townsmen Temporarily Seek Alms; Old Mother and Young Children Depend on Him for a Living; Xiang's Wife, Who Just Gave Birth, Is Devastated

Xiang Dongchuan refused to be a pawn in the company's repeated fare increases, citing insufficient expenses, and therefore did not receive a ticket after paying the fare. When he requested one, he was instead pushed and killed by the ticket seller, Wang Wanxiang, who was embarrassed into anger. Public sentiment is very indignant. It is because the scalping of tickets has become an open secret, but everyone thinks it is a trivial matter and does not involve them, so they mostly let it go. But Xiang, with his upright nature, angered the ticket seller and unfortunately died unnaturally. People in society are all saddened by this. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency visited his home to record the details as follows:

Always Upright, Never Worked in Production

Xiang Dongchuan, courtesy name Junhai, is from Ruian, Wenzhou. He is 42 years old. He studied at Peking University in his early years and is the younger brother of Xiang Weichen, the former director of the Peking Salt Affairs Bureau. Xiang also worked in the bureau. He has always been clean and self-respecting, running around north and south for nearly 20 years. He is kind and approachable, and his nature is upright. He spends all his salary as soon as he receives it. He has eight children, three sons and five daughters. The eldest daughter is already engaged, and the youngest is not yet a month old. His elderly mother is still alive. After the war, he brought his family to Shanghai, but because he was unfamiliar with the people and places, his plans were mostly unsuccessful, so he was unhappy. The family's life cannot be sustained without 400 to 500 yuan, but he is the only one to rely on.

Son Sent to Sister's Home for Care

More than ten days before his tragic death, his wife gave birth to a son. Because she was weak after childbirth and unable to take care of her seven-year-old child, he entrusted the child to Xiang's sister on Avenue Sainte-Marie for care. That afternoon, Xiang took the No. 20 trolleybus from Yuyuan Road to his sister's place to see the child. At that time, he was wearing plain clothes because his father had just passed away, looking like a country bumpkin, and was not valued by people. Therefore, the ticket seller dared to forcibly act illegally, treating human life like grass, and pushed him down violently, causing him to fall and die. This can be based on the testimony of witnesses.

Waiting to Be Fed, Neighbors Feel Sad

Xiang's wife was in the postpartum period when she suddenly heard the bad news. She was devastated, resulting in insufficient breast milk. The newly born baby was hungry and unable to eat, crying sadly, further injuring her heart. She hopes to hire a wet nurse, but has no remaining funds. She also lacks the ability to buy milk powder. She now plans to send the child to a charitable organization to be raised, or to be adopted by someone as a godson. Now that Xiang has died tragically, causing his family to be separated, the neighbors who hear about it all feel saddened. This is truly what is called a living separation and death.

Cash Gifts Temporarily Provide for the Orphans and Widows

The Wenzhou Fellow Townsmen Association values ​​Xiang's character very much. Surprised and saddened by the bad news, in addition to mourning, they plan to launch an appeal for donations at the time of the memorial service for Xiang's family, informing all sectors of society to widely donate gifts, all in cash, so that his orphans, widows, old and young, can maintain their lives for the time being. As for his lifelong pension, his family will file a private lawsuit with the court, calculated at 4,000 yuan per year until Xiang is 60 years old, demanding that the company to which the ticket seller belongs bear the responsibility for payment.

### Municipal Council's Rice Subsidy for Chinese Employees

### Strict Investigation by Police Authorities: Major Suppression of Drug Trafficking Activities; Unprecedented Sharp Decrease in Drug Cases in the Courts; Significant Reduction in Transportation Difficulties and Transactions

According to the "North-China Daily News," it was learned yesterday (the 24th) that in recent months, drug trafficking cases in the area south of Suzhou Creek in the International Settlement have significantly decreased. Those familiar with the situation believe that the main reason for this decline is the increasing difficulty encountered by those smuggling drugs. Last year, the First Special District Court almost daily heard cases of drug smuggling. Today, however, the cases it hears are mostly related to opium smoking and operating "swallows' nests" (opium dens), with only occasional cases of selling heroin and other drugs. This indicates that while drug trafficking activities, once rampant in the International Settlement, have not been completely eradicated, the vigilance of the Settlement authorities has become more stringent, forcing drug traffickers to be more cautious when attempting to bring drugs into the International Settlement. Furthermore, those assisting in this nefarious trade demand even greater compensation, which is another reason for the decline in drug trafficking activities. Although there are still enough ships available for drug traffickers to continue their illicit business, the fact that the number of ships docking at various ports in North China has decreased has dealt a significant blow to drug trafficking gangs. In the past, stokers on these ships would routinely pack opium and heroin in boxes, hide them in the coal piles, and upon arriving in Shanghai, take out the drugs and throw them overboard, where pre-arranged sampans would collect them one by one. While this method is still used today, it is less frequent due to increased surveillance by the authorities, higher smuggling costs, and the reluctance of sailors to participate. Therefore, drug traffickers have had to lie low and wait for easier opportunities to act again.

However, it is generally believed that the decline in drug trafficking activities is only seen in the International Settlement and in areas under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, as the Police Department has been making every effort to curb drug trafficking for the past six months. Those who sell heroin, opium, and red pills do not have a central organization, and for the convenience of trade, they rely on third parties for distribution. Many of these distributors are Koreans, who pass the drugs to those who run drug dens or to drug users. From the drug cases handled by the courts, it can be seen that after the drugs arrive in Shanghai, they are immediately purchased by Koreans. These people often set up drug dens in Hongkou and Guanbei, and their customers are mainly Chinese. However, when the police raid drug dens, they have also found foreign vagrants among them, who are only fined and then released. Although those who actively engage in drug trafficking are given heavier punishments, they are not as severe as those stipulated by Chinese criminal law. Chinese criminal law stipulates that those who traffic or use drugs, as well as those involved in drug trafficking, are severely punished. Therefore, the First Special District Court sentences such individuals to deprivation of civil rights, imprisonment from five to fifteen years, and other more severe penalties. Many believe that there are currently individuals monopolizing opium in Shanghai, but this has not yet been confirmed. Their central organization is likely located in an area outside the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. Distributors often obtain several ounces or pounds of drugs, which they then sell in the Settlement, always arranging to deliver the goods and receive payment in quiet alleys, and continue to order drugs. Sometimes, they would notify buyers in advance, arranging for them to meet on a certain day to distribute small quantities of drugs. Although drug trafficking activities in the International Settlement have now decreased to an unprecedented level, after the end of the Shanghai war and the westward movement of the Chinese army, the rampant drug trade in Shanghai was unprecedented. Most of the drugs were shipped to Shanghai from ports such as Tianjin, Beiping, and Hankou, apparently due to the lax control over drug exports in these ports. About a year ago, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs seized opium worth four million yuan, which was probably the largest amount of opium seized in the history of the Jianghai Customs. Last year, several drug traffickers were arrested and confessed in the First Special District Court that they belonged to a drug trafficking gang based in Tianjin, and that opium and other drugs were supplied by Tianjin. The gang members have been rounded up with the cooperation of the Tianjin authorities, but this is still not enough to deter others from following suit.

### Soliciting Sales of White Rice: Fraudulent Acquisition of Money

Victims Can Report to the Police Station

Yesterday afternoon, a Chinese man went to a residence on Rue Cardinal Foch, soliciting sales of white rice, quoting a price of sixty-eight yuan per picul, which was much cheaper than the market price. The resident immediately instructed his daughter to go and collect the rice. However, on the tram, the rice seller was recognized by someone who had been defrauded of money by him using the same method several days ago. He was then arrested and sent to the police station. The rice seller, named Ye Di-di-di, twenty-seven years old, residing on East Zilaihuo Street, had recently been using the following method to defraud people of money: first soliciting sales of cheap rice, and once the money was in hand, going with the buyer to the delivery location, but upon arriving there, taking the money and disappearing like a yellow crane. The suspect has confessed to committing several similar cases of fraud. Victims are requested to report to the Detective Division of the French Police Station at 22 Rue Tenant de la Tour, in order to verify the case.

### Resolution of Labor-Management Negotiations at Gonghexiang Shuntai Wharf

More than a thousand workers at the Gonghexiang and Shuntai wharves in Hongkou went on a joint strike on the 18th of last month, due to demands for improved treatment, which resulted in bloodshed. After mediation by various parties, the striking workers resumed work on the 1st of this month. The negotiation phase continued with both parties consulting together. It is now reported that the case has been settled through negotiations between labor and management. Both sides have also signed a complete agreement, providing generous compensation and medical expenses for the workers who were killed or injured in the shooting.

### Man Dies Suddenly on the Road

Yesterday at 5 PM, an unidentified man, approximately forty years old, suddenly fell ill and collapsed in front of number 481 Route Vallon in the French Concession. A watchman from number 481 reported it to the police station. He was taken to Guangci Hospital by car, but unfortunately, the treatment was ineffective, and he died shortly after entering the hospital. The body was taken to the morgue yesterday to await examination. If there are any relatives, they can go to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall to claim the body.

### Doctors Are Public Servants of Society!

— Mu Chang

At this time and in this place, having food to eat is already a fortunate thing, so why eat too much? There are still people dying from overeating, but they shouldn't be; because they do, a group of people starve to death.

It is not an exorbitant demand for us to ask for the living resources sufficient to sustain life, but most people have been getting thinner all along. The nutritional problem of the people is truly the most serious reality. Not to mention the vagrants on the streets who lack vitamins ABCD, even among the student groups recently, there are already many malnourished "too thin students," and some have even become consumptive. The percentage is frightening.

When you become a patient due to malnutrition, you more urgently need to wait for treatment, but now it costs twenty-five yuan to eat a pound of cod liver oil, and what about getting a shot of Cibamin? Occasionally asking a doctor for advice and being given a prescription will only make your condition worse!

It is undeniable that a group of noble doctors seem to be holed up in an ivory tower. Refusing to see patients late at night is considered status, and going to register during the day, they arrive late at night. If the consultation fee is doubled, they can come earlier, or even come right away.

But doctors are said to have the heart to cut flesh to save others since ancient times, and good doctors who "embrace the suffering of the people" do not seem to be copying the ancients. Being a doctor does not seem to be a charitable job, but even if they are "national doctors," if they value themselves too much, causing ordinary people to step back, that is the most selfish thing. Some senior good doctors did not accumulate property, and treated patients no differently than family members, and were always worried that they were not doing their best in clinical practice. To this day, they are still highly praised and their good reputation is endlessly praised; some modern doctors, still demand the full consultation fee from poor relatives, in order to show their impartiality (?), but in fact, they have accumulated millions, so what is the point?

Recently, it was reported that the Chulin Sun Hospital sponsored the Chinese Health Association, and its declaration is truly a genuine prescription: "... All the doctors and important medicines in the country should be nationalized and allocated for the life-saving medicines needed, which cannot be manipulated by others! Doctors are not a free profession, they are public servants of society. The goal of medicine is to improve health and eliminate disease, not luxury goods." These words are spoken from the mouth of a professional, and are truly extremely painful. May we, based on this original intention, move forward bravely, allow everyone to see it, and create benefits for society, that would be fortunate!

### Ticket Sellers Complain of Suffering Due to the "Squeezing Oil" Problem

We recently received a letter from Wu Guang, Wu Sheng, and other ticket sellers of the British Tramway Company. They said, "This is a collective request from us, and these are the words that the ticket sellers want to say but have no opportunity to say." We sympathize with them very much, so we have published the letter below.

Xiang Dongchuan's death in a fall from a tram is something that everyone should care about and help with. Whether Wang Wanxiang "squeezed oil" or not is a factual question and a legal question. At the beginning of the incident, it was difficult to determine before the truth was fully understood, but when the court recently tried the case, the police lawyer requested that Wang be sentenced to criminal punishment, which shows the general situation of this case. Of course, if Wang Wanxiang is completely wronged, the citizens should also help to clear his name.

After this letter is published, we will wait quietly for the fair judgment of the court on the Wang Wanxiang case. If there are letters of the same nature, we will not continue to publish them.

Since the incident of Wang Wanxiang, ticket seller number 358 of the British Tramway Company, falling and killing passenger Xiang Dongchuan, the general public in Shanghai and various newspapers have been criticizing and blaming us. We generally do not oppose the opinions of knowledgeable people in society, but we have always felt that it is regrettable that the media has not assumed its educational responsibility, nor has it analyzed the problem.

Whether ticket seller Wang Wanxiang should bear legal responsibility and what is right and wrong will eventually come to light. This is a legal question, and we will not discuss it for the time being. What we want to appeal to all citizens of Shanghai and the media is the real life situation of our ticket sellers: First of all, there should be some explanation for the so-called "squeezing oil" problem for ticket sellers. In the eyes of the citizens of the whole city, the company raises prices again and again, and the whole public satirizes this as a result of ticket sellers "squeezing oil." But which of the public utilities in Shanghai has not raised prices again and again? Everyone knows that the ticket sellers of the French Tramway do not "squeeze oil," so why is the fare not cheaper than the British Tramway? If the British Tramway authorities have not yet obtained a suitable way to improve the administration, no matter how many ticket inspectors are added, and do not fundamentally improve the minimum living treatment of each employee, and cooperate with well-organized and good ticket sellers, it is fundamentally impossible to eradicate this habit of the past thirty years, especially in today's high cost of living. Secondly, regarding the general attitude of the ticket sellers, we believe that it is easier to talk about this issue in front of our fellow Chinese. Here, passengers can think carefully, isn't our attitude very friendly when there are few passengers in the car? When there are many passengers, there may be some bad attitudes, but this bad attitude is not intentional to be against the passengers, nor is there any deep hatred with the passengers. Moreover, the quality of passengers varies, and some passengers do not buy tickets when they get on the bus, which is discovered by the ticket inspector, and as a result, the company often imposes a penalty of no less than ten or twenty yuan. Do people in society understand our hidden pain? We have not received any understanding or sympathy from people in society.

If our appeal can be published in your newspaper, this is a collective request from us, and these are the words that most of our ticket sellers want to say but have no opportunity to say. Signed, ticket sellers Wu Guang, Wu Sheng, etc. (No remuneration)

In the Circle of Life

### How I Work as a Waitress

— Mu Feng

In the year I was about to graduate, my father unfortunately died of illness. My mother decided to ask me to drop out of school and get a job. As a result of my mother and I running around, we were either given the cold shoulder or politely refused. After a period of time, my mother's younger sister, my second aunt, agreed to introduce me to work as a waitress.

One sunny afternoon, my second aunt took me to a large hotel - it was the place I would be working - a steel and concrete building, luxurious and magnificent inside, with melodious music, sometimes rising and sometimes falling. Modern ladies, arm in arm, went in and out, and my second aunt and I also walked into this large hotel in the crowd. We waited for an hour or two before we finally met Mr. ×, the accountant, a middle-aged man in his thirties, with his hair slicked back, wearing a light gray suit. My second aunt exchanged a few polite words with him, and then explained the purpose of our visit. Then he turned those large, frightening eyes on me and said:

"The appearance is very good, but it seems too honest."

"Yes! I also said that, no matter what, I must ask you to help, we are sure of it." My second aunt quickly followed up.

"Okay! Miss Er, for your sake, ha... hey! Come to work tomorrow." After speaking, he walked away.

On the way home, my second aunt showed me great concern, teaching me many ways to treat people and handle things, and repeatedly told me to apply more powder and rouge tomorrow, and dress up well. If I didn't have clothes, she could lend them to me. I agreed to everything.

Now I am starting a new life - a life with an indescribable taste. I spend all day in the wine-scented and food-filled dining room, serving adults, wives, young masters, and young ladies, walking back and forth, and when I am busy, I don't even have time to eat. When I am free, I am not allowed to leave.

Mr. X always stares at me with big eyes, rolling around. Ah Ying secretly told me: "He is a bad guy, he specializes in wanting to take advantage of women, he looks like he is thinking about you."

"Hey! Boy, no, Girl, come quickly." The young fellow is calling me again. He is wearing a white suit, waving his hand and saying to his friends: "This is a beautiful one, a new one." I have already walked to the dining table.

"Wait here, let us think," he said:

"Hey! Who do you think she looks like?" he asked his friends.

"No! McDonald." One defended.

"Not at all, she looks like Garbo, look! Aren't the eyes very similar?" Hehe... a burst of laughter.

"Gentlemen, what do you want?" I asked, suppressing my anger and putting on a smile.

"Ha, ha... we want, we want you to stand here and let us look at you." They said very naturally, and laughed even more recklessly.

I was numb, standing there blankly with my head down. Suddenly, a rude hand patted me on the shoulder, followed by a roll of something stuffed into my hand. When I looked up, these crazy fellows had already walked down the stairs. I picked up the thing in my hand and looked at it. It was two ten-yuan bills, with a note attached that read "Tonight × Hua is waiting for you, don't miss it."

Heavens, what is going on?

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Twelve Unexpected Troubles

I am an old man, and those two fellows were useless. They were knocked down as soon as they moved. The person with a black cloth covering his face was the fiercest. In just a flash, he used a rope to tie up Lin Sheng tightly, immediately carried him on his back, and left like a whirlwind... Originally, it was not your family's business, and we wouldn't dare to trouble you, but according to the two fellows who were left behind, they were a group of people..."

The old man spoke almost breathless, and Begonia's heart was already beating faster than boiling water.

"Uncle Wu, this is what they said:" The daughter-in-law of the Meng family was originally a fast talker, and could not wait to interject. "They said that they only have a relationship with you, old man, and as long as you say a word, not only can the person be released, but the previous matter doesn't need to be pursued. So we specially came to beg you, please have mercy on my father-in-law, who only has this one root..."

"Brother Wu, we have been old neighbors for many years, please help me, and I will thank you later!" As Meng Lao Zhanggui said, he repeatedly bowed.

It was fortunate that Begonia was originally a sick person. Although her complexion changed, Meng Lao Zhanggui and his party could not see it.

"But, Lao Zhanggui," he was able to answer as if nothing had happened, only after finally calming down. "This matter is too strange. Who are those people after all? I haven't even seen them. How can I go and reason with them?" (Twenty-two)

### Prospects for Go (Part 1)

— Qu Qing

Go is one of the national quintessences of our country. It was most prosperous during the Qi and Liang dynasties. Xiao Daocheng and Xiao Yan both loved it. For a time, the officials of the court became accustomed to it, and talents emerged in large numbers. The grandeur of the time can be seen in the fragments of records in the Book of Southern Qi, the Book of Liang, and the History of the North. It is a pity that the historians did not record the war in detail, and none of the diagrams from that time have been passed down, so it is impossible to compare their merits with the chess players of later generations. Since the Tang and Song dynasties, chess matters have been very sparse, only surviving through circulation. During the Qing Dynasty, Guobailing (the Guo family were descendants of the Ming Dynasty) sorted out old diagrams and created new diagrams (namely, the "Xianji Wuku" and "Sizi Pu" etc.). Xu Xingyou was the first to create chess reviews (namely, "Jianshantang Yipu"), and the art of go began to revive. Mr. Huang Longshi was outstanding in the early years of Kangxi. In modern times, the evaluation of our country's chess skills, from ancient times to the present, has not exceeded Huang Longshi. (Huang's name was Qiu, and his courtesy name was Longshi. He was from Taizhou. He became a national player when he was more than ten years old. Du Chucun's "Biantang Wenji" has a preface to Huang, and later he changed his name to Xia, and his courtesy name was Yuetian). From Kangxi to the early years of Qianlong, there were many national players, and at that time, Liang (Wei Jin), Cheng (Lanru), Shi (Xiangxia), and Fan (Xiping) were called the leaders. It declined slightly at the end of Qianlong. At that time, there were only second-hand players and no first-hand players. (See "Yuewei Caotang Notes"). During the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, Chen Zixian and Zhou Xiaosong were the most famous, but Xiaosong said to people that he admitted that if he met Shi Fan, he would not be able to defeat them. After Xiaosong passed away, there were no successors. By the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, it was a period of decline in the art.

Fortunately, in modern times, there is Wu Qingyuan from Fujian, who was able to overwhelm all the players of the time at the age of sixteen, and then went to Japan to study, where he learned from the people of that country, worked hard to invent, the "Tengen Three-Star" and other tactics, and the style of go changed suddenly. Old diagrams in bookstores were almost ignored. The Japanese called his chess quality to have the style of the chess saint Shusaku, and also regarded him as a strange child (meaning prodigy), and also called him a flower chess national player (that is, the four-four and fourteen and central and other positions on the chessboard all have flowers as marks), and also called him the "Black Invincible." He lived in Japan for several years, and his rank advanced rapidly. At the age of twenty-two, due to physical weakness, he followed his doctor's advice to take a temporary rest, and also returned to China for a few months. During his rest period of about one or two years, although he did not compete with the outside world, his ambition to improve has never been relaxed. When he came out to face his opponents again, his style of go was even more severe. Recently, in a ten-game match with Mr. Kiyoshi Kitani (Mr. Kitani won the Honinbo title nine years ago), he won six games to take the lead, and then the press recommended the only remaining old eighth dan Jyunichi Karigane to come out and compete, and ten games were scheduled. The first game was recently revealed, and Mr. Karigane, holding black, has already resigned in the middle game.

The results of his ten games can be imagined. Wu is called a seventh-dan chess player in Japan, but judging from his record, his strength must have reached the ninth dan. He can be compared with Mr. Huang Longshi of the previous generation. Moreover, he is only a young man of twenty-eight years old, and his character and temperament are extremely excellent. There will be unlimited progress in the future. The existence of Mr. Wu in the go world of our country is like an auspicious star, no wonder the go players in the country are always happy and excited when they talk about Mr. Wu's affairs.

### "Home" Movie Story (4)

— Zhou Yibai

After the New Year's Eve dinner, everyone was happily preparing for the New Year, especially the younger siblings who were not yet adults, were even busier. Juexin returned to his room, looked at the plum blossoms in the pot, and then looked at the curtain fringe that his cousin Mei had painted for him before, and he felt a little sad. At the same time, Juehui and Mingfeng also met in front of the hall, intending to confide in each other, but his sister Shuying called Mingfeng away, so Juehui's heart was also a little unhappy. The happiest ones were Juemin and Zhang Yunhua, who were in the same room, talking eloquently, as if their two hearts had already merged into one.

Juexin and Mei were an established tragedy, and they were not supposed to have any contact with each other. Unexpectedly, after Mei remarried, her husband died within a short period of time, and she returned to her mother's home. Thus, this pair of ill-fated lovers met again in the same place, and over time, Li Ruijue also learned about this. Although she sympathized with Mei's situation, she had no way to resolve this dispute. She once confessed to Mei that she was willing to step aside and let Mei and Juexin get together. However, Mei did not dare to agree, thinking that this was too much of a loss to others and a benefit to herself.

On the other hand, Juehui not only forgot his status because of his love for Mingfeng, but he even frankly told Mingfeng that he would formally marry her as his wife. This was naturally a pleasant surprise for Mingfeng, and she also told Juehui that she had been taught by Juehui's eldest sister. Since Juehui's eldest sister died, she loved only Juehui, besides her mother. She expressed that she would fight for Juehui to the end and would never easily submit because she was a slave.

As for Juemin and Zhang Yunhua, although they were already in love, they felt a sense of worry about the unpredictability of human affairs. However, they both believed that this marriage would not be like Juexin and Mei's. Even if they faced the same obstacles as Juexin and Mei, they would not easily break up. Because Yunhua's will was stronger, and Juemin was more decisive than his eldest brother.

Theater News: The Chinese Amateur Dramatic Society will perform the three-act tragedy "Sharing Life and Death" at the Russian Art Theatre tomorrow (Saturday).

### Blood Rain in Qiong Yuan

Chapter 17: A Crown of Fury for a Beautiful Woman

Wu Sangui saw that both of them were handsome young men and was very happy. He immediately appointed them to the position of bajong and had them serve under his command along with Zhang, Chen, and others. The two thanked him for his kindness. Wu Sangui heard that Xu Jing had come from Ningwu Pass, so he asked them to sit down and asked about the situation of the rebels. Xu Jing answered one by one, saying that the power of the rebels was growing day by day, which was worrying, but the worrying thing was that the local officials could not communicate with each other and use the method of fortified walls and clearing the fields to deal with them. And the military officers sent by the imperial court were all sometimes suppressing and sometimes appeasing, with no fixed purpose, and no determination to make decisive decisions, and the soldiers were unwilling to fight, so they could not defeat the rebels. Moreover, the people in various places were forced by hunger and cold due to years of famine and were ready to revolt. As soon as the rebels arrived, many local ruffians, vagrants, and refugees would act as their internal support, often rising up in response, so their power was like a wildfire, unapproachable. Sangui listened and agreed. Zhang Cang also said, "General, you are following the imperial decree to send troops into the pass to suppress the rebels, which is a matter of great importance. However, the Manchus are eyeing us with their newly rising power, always wanting to invade. The current temporary peace is not reliable. Once the general leads a large army into the pass, how can they not take the opportunity to move? I am afraid that the general's mighty army will enter Shanhaiguan in the morning, and the Manchu iron cavalry will rush to Ningyuan in the evening." Sangui listened and nodded, saying, "What Bajong Zhang said is not without reason. But if I enter the pass, the defense here cannot be easily abandoned. I should order Youji Chai to stay here to guard against any eventuality. The current situation is really very critical. Externally, we cannot ignore it, and internally, it is like putting out a fire, which cannot be delayed. The emperor has no troops to deploy, so he summoned me to enter the pass to protect the capital."
