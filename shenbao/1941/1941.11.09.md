Chongqing - Yesterday afternoon, General Chiang Kai-shek specially received foreign visitors and expressed his belief in the ultimate victory of all democratic countries and China, and especially praised the three countries of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union for the role they played in this war against aggression. The General stated that the aggressors are intensifying their aggression, causing the war against aggression to reach a severe time, but at present, there is a sign of historical solidarity among the countries resisting aggression. Therefore, all democratic countries must redouble their efforts to cooperate closely and strive for the final victory. Regarding the war in China, the General said that the initiative will soon belong to our side, and this statement will be proven by facts. At that time, I will meet with you again. The visitors said that the weather in Chongqing was unpleasant and jokingly asked whether the General would improve the weather. The General replied, "Yes, we will return to Nanjing, where the weather is better." Madame Chiang, who was also present, said, "We will also go to Beiping, where the weather is historically good." The General also stated that the military and economic missions of friendly nations are now working in China in factories, armies, and financial and economic institutions in the rear and at the front, and serving along transportation lines, which shows that democratic countries are jointly working to overthrow the aggressors. Today's China has become a front line outside the Chinese border, especially a part of the defense front line of the Pacific nations. The General especially praised Britain, saying that although Britain was outnumbered, it still bravely defended Britain, fought bloody battles in Norway, Greece, Crete, and Libya, and assisted the invaded countries. The General also praised the United States for supplying all democratic countries with weapons and materials, and then said that the heroic resistance of the Soviet Union exceeded all expectations. The General then proposed a toast to the victory of the Soviet Union (the General personally attended the reception at the Soviet Embassy yesterday morning). The General continued that the war will reform human thoughts and ways of life, and it is expected that after the war, all countries will make the final contribution to world peace and prosperity, and will not allow aggressors to gain a foothold in the world. The General received the visitors in a spacious reception room with great energy and vigor, sitting on a sofa chair with Madame Chiang sitting beside him. The General recited a pre-prepared statement, but often inserted impromptu words. An American female visitor offered refreshments, and the General said in English, "Thank you, thank you very much." The General and his wife shook hands and chatted with each visitor, casually, but did not make formal remarks. The General recalled that he had received foreign visitors many times before, and expressed particular concern for visitors who had visited the Chinese military front, repeatedly stating that any foreign visitors who wanted to visit the front would be provided with convenience. Of all the receptions for journalists held by the General, yesterday's was probably the largest in scope, with representatives from British, American, and Soviet newspapers, news agencies, broadcasting companies, magazines, and newly opened photography agencies, totaling thirty people.

Chongqing - This afternoon, General Chiang Kai-shek received foreign reporters at his official residence, with Madame Chiang also present. After refreshments were served, he expressed his views on the current development of the war and the changes in the world after the war, which were translated by Dong Xianguang, Deputy Minister of Propaganda. General Chiang Kai-shek believes that based on the various signs of the current evolution, after mankind has deeply tasted the pain of aggressive warfare, there will inevitably be fundamental changes in thought and life in the future. All aggressive forces must not continue to exist, and mankind must help each other with the Christian spirit of love. Therefore, he firmly believes that true human equality and world peace will be realized because mankind understands justice. Regarding the current situation, General Chiang Kai-shek said that the unity and struggle of the anti-aggression countries is entering an important period, and the war of resistance in both the East and the West is developing at a high level, but the initiative is still in the hands of the aggressors, who are launching a second wave of attacks against democratic countries. Therefore, democratic countries should unite more closely and strengthen their defenses. China has been resisting aggression for more than four years and deeply understands the necessity of close coordination on all fronts and knows that the future counter-offensive will depend on the degree of unity in the world. The military and economic delegations of friendly nations are now working hard in the front and rear of China. This move has already established the best foundation for unity, and the benefits of unity are now obvious. In some respects, it has made the aggressors hesitate, as if trapped in a quagmire. From this, it can be believed that the initiative will soon be in our hands, and it is expected that facts can prove it one day. At that time, we will discuss it with you. The above is the main part of General Chiang Kai-shek's speech. At the beginning of his speech, he said in the most cordial attitude and tone that because of the busy military affairs, he could not meet with you often. Today, taking this opportunity, we can talk casually. Many of those present are also overseas Chinese from countries that have been invaded, and their compatriots are also engaged in the war of resistance like China, so they are our comrades. Although the United States has not participated in the war, it has provided great assistance to the invaded, so it can also be regarded as a comrade. General Chiang asked the reporters if they felt anything was wrong in Chongqing. Everyone said they were satisfied with everything, but one reporter said jokingly, can the weather be changed? General Chiang Kai-shek smiled and replied, when we return to Nanjing next year, the weather will be like that. (Havas, 7th)

Chongqing - According to reporters who participated in the tea party held by General Chiang Kai-shek at his private residence, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the spirit and health of General Chiang Kai-shek seen this time are the best. This is the third time since the Sino-Japanese War that the General and his wife have hosted a family tea party for journalists, and this is the second time it has been held in Chongqing. The reporters gathered in a comfortable place, with charcoal fire in the room. One reporter said that General Chiang Kai-shek's speech at the tea party could be called China's first fireside chat. Madame Chiang smiled and said, "No, this is a charcoal fire chat." (United Press, 8th)

This new offensive is currently being prepared. The Chinese people must strengthen unity, support the National Government, adhere to the war of resistance to the end, and prepare all counter-offensive conditions in order to expel the Japanese troops from the country in time. (Havas, 1st)

### Yu Junxian Discusses the General Situation of Overseas Chinese Education

Chongqing - Yu Junxian, member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and Director of the Overseas Chinese Education Department, went abroad in June this year to inspect overseas Chinese education in Macau, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, and Burma, which lasted eight months, and recently returned to Chongqing. According to his talk, the impression of this inspection was very good. In recent years, overseas Chinese education has made considerable progress in both quality and quantity. In particular, the ambition of overseas Chinese youth is vigorous, and they are working hard to study and prepare to serve the motherland, which is admirable. Overseas Chinese education in Australia is relatively backward, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has allocated funds to subsidize the establishment of overseas Chinese schools. Two schools can be opened in the spring of next year, and preparations are underway. Overseas Chinese newspapers in various places are also very developed. People in various places donate money and gold to comfort the soldiers, which is very admirable. (8th dispatch)

### US President Announces to the Press Consideration of Withdrawing Troops Stationed in China, a Move to Strengthen the Bargaining Position in Negotiations with Japan and at the Same Time Prepare the Navy for War

United Press, 8th, Washington Urgent Dispatch - It was learned here today that the commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in China has been ordered to prepare for the immediate withdrawal of the Marine Corps stationed in China. It is learned that the order was issued by President Roosevelt yesterday when he announced at a reception for the press that he was considering withdrawing the US Marine Corps in China. According to naval authorities, there are only 970 Marines stationed in China, 750 of whom are stationed in Shanghai, 165 in Tianjin, and 55 in Beiping.

United Press, 8th, Washington Dispatch - Last night, reliable sources here said that President Roosevelt's announcement that the US Fourth Marine Regiment may withdraw from China is obviously intended to strengthen the US's bargaining position in future negotiations with Japan. Observers also said that the small military force currently in China will become a suicidal army in the event of war. Secretary of State Hull refused to specifically comment on McKinley's order to withdraw troops, but he recalled that the State Department had repeatedly advised American citizens to withdraw from China. Hull's words were in response to the question of whether McKinley's order to withdraw troops was related to overseas Chinese.

United Press, 8th, Washington Dispatch - After President Roosevelt announced that the US Fourth Marine Regiment may withdraw from China, non-official circles here believe that it is an implication of a warning about possible developments between the US and Japan. This speculation is based on the fact that the Marine Corps in China is only a symbolic army and will be in a dangerous position in the event of an incident. This announcement is obviously a new warning to advise American citizens to leave China. However, some Japanese sources here said that this announcement may be an auspicious omen, because the Japanese side recently proposed recalling the Marine Corps as a gesture of improving relations. On the other hand, President Roosevelt specifically stated that this issue was not mentioned in the US-Japan negotiations. Therefore, it is unclear whether President Roosevelt's or the Japanese side's information is erroneous. President Roosevelt's use of the words "on shore" obviously meant that there was some important significance, or it implied that the Marine Corps would remain on warships, possibly staying in Asian waters. After President Roosevelt issued this announcement, he refused to speculate on when a definite decision would be made, only saying that he was "considering" withdrawing the Marine Corps in China. The President refused to answer questions on this issue. He specifically stated that Japan and the United States had not discussed the withdrawal of the Marine Corps. He said that he did not know whether the consideration of withdrawing the Marine Corps would affect the territorial issue in the Sino-Japanese War. He said that he did not know the number of Marine Corps and overseas Chinese in the Far East, but he recalled that the overseas Chinese there had been repeatedly advised to return to their country.

The United States Will Not Budge on Japan's Aggression Against China

Reuters, 8th, Washington Dispatch - Qualified observers here believe that President Roosevelt's statement that the government is now considering withdrawing the Marine Corps in China is a psychological effect and also to prevent possible unpleasant incidents. Some people also believe that this announcement can have the same effect as the withdrawal of American citizens from Japan a few months ago in awakening Japan, as it is also an action to remove obstacles to deal with Japan. The anti-American remarks recently published in Japanese newspapers have made public opinion here increasingly strong, which can be seen in the words of President McKinley's speech on Thursday night praising China's resistance against Japan, such as China's social progress being destroyed by barbarism. However, well-informed observers believe that the visit of Japanese special envoy Kurusu is proof that Japan is eager to reach a compromise with the United States, because Japan is now gradually feeling the pain of American economic pressure. It is now known that the US position has not changed, and it is still based on the Nine-Power Treaty and the published obligations to China and to Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies in the Pacific. This position will never allow for any retreat on the recognition of Japan's decade-long aggression. Therefore, whatever price Japan is willing to pay in exchange for American friendship and stability in the Pacific region is only for Japan to decide. If Kurusu comes to the United States hoping to make a tough compromise, then he will encounter failure, and after the failure of the negotiations, Japan seems to be adopting the method that Tokyo newspapers have recently threatened the United States with. The Washington military community has long held the view that the American troops in China should be greatly increased or completely withdrawn. According to recent naval records, there were a total of 1,500 American sailors stationed in China six months ago. The sailors in Beiping were guards of the embassy, while the American troops in Tianjin and Shanghai have been greatly reduced since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. As for the Yangtze River and other places, there are several small American gunboats, but the American President did not mention you. According to recent estimates, there are fewer than 5,000 Americans living in China.

Havas, 7th, Washington Dispatch - President Roosevelt's announcement that the United States is now considering withdrawing the Marine Corps in China was foreseen by naval circles months ago. Therefore, there is no surprise about this matter.

United Press, 7th, Military Celebration Dispatch - Officials remain silent regarding the US consideration of withdrawing the Marine Corps stationed in China. They generally pointed out that Washington knows what is best, but some people also lamented that this move may be interpreted as a gesture of making peace with Japan, especially at this time.

### US Senate Approves Merchant Ships Entering War Zones, to Be Implemented Immediately Upon Passage by the House of Representatives, US Establishes Naval Base in Iceland

Reuters, 8th, Washington Dispatch - After a fierce debate yesterday, the Senate passed a bill by a vote of 50 to 37 to allow US merchant ships to be armed and to allow US merchant ships to enter the ports and war zones of belligerent countries. The bill will be sent to the House of Representatives for reconsideration, because the House of Representatives previously passed only the item of arming merchant ships by a vote of 259 to 13. Government leaders believe that the House of Representatives will definitely approve the Senate's amendments by a majority vote, and action will be taken around Wednesday. If the result is satisfactory, then this bill can be sent directly to the White House for the President to sign into law. When the Senate debated this bill, the atmosphere was very tense, which was rare in the past. Not only was there no empty seat in the meeting hall, but the audience seats were also very crowded. The voting was quite chaotic, and Vice President Wallace repeatedly urged to pay attention to order. There were three votes. The first vote was 49 to 38 to allow US ships to enter the ports and war zones of belligerent countries. The second vote was 50 to 38 to accept the Foreign Affairs Committee's amendment to allow US ships to be armed and to enter the ports of belligerent countries. The third vote was 50 to 37 to allow US ships to be armed and to allow US merchant ships to enter the ports and war zones of belligerent countries. Thus, the original texts of the first and second of the Neutrality Act were cancelled. This can be regarded as President Roosevelt's greatest success in the Senate. Radio commentators said that US merchant ships can now sail to any port in the world and carry American arms to supply Central Asia. In other words, British and American merchant ships and warships will engage in the war in the Atlantic from now on. The Senate's decision undoubtedly represents the will of the majority of the American people, and this decision will bring the United States closer to participating in the war.

Havas, 8th, Washington Dispatch - The Senate's passage of the Neutrality Act amendment is an unprecedented victory for the government, because the United States can formally abandon isolationism from now on and restore its traditional policy of freedom of the seas.

United Press, 8th, Washington Dispatch - Sea Chief Knox said that the US Navy has established an operational base in Iceland, with Rear Admiral Huffman as commander, under the command of the Commander of the Atlantic Fleet.

US Railway Workers Brew General Strike

Haitong News Agency, 8th, Washington Dispatch - It was learned last night that the chairmen of the five railway worker unions in the United States announced that a general strike would be held on December 5. This matter was decided after the failure of the arbitration meeting. The members of the association, designated by President Roosevelt, had given the workers wage increases ranging from 7.5% to 13.5%. The general strike was originally scheduled for September 5, but was postponed to after the arbitration meeting after mediation by Weissford.

### Kurusu Left the Philippines Yesterday, Flew to Honolulu to Transfer to the United States, Tokyo Newspapers Unanimously Criticize the Conclusion of US-Japan Talks, Saying It Cannot Be Overly Optimistic

United Press, 8th, Manila Dispatch - Japanese special envoy to the United States, Kurusu, took a Pan American Clipper this morning to Honolulu to transfer to the United States. His trip is to participate in Ambassador Nomura's US-Japan talks to avoid the crisis in the Pacific.

United Press, 8th, Tokyo Dispatch - The only Japanese newspaper in Tokyo to comment on Kurusu's visit to the United States today, the Miyako Shimbun, reiterated that unless the United States "completely changes its attitude," this mission will fail. The Miyako Shimbun said that Japan is resolutely and calmly watching the development of the situation.

Haitong News Agency, 8th, Tokyo Dispatch - Yesterday, the newspapers here commented on Japan's dispatch of Kurusu to the United States as a special advisor to the embassy. Yesterday afternoon's newspapers concluded that it should not be overly optimistic about this matter. The Yomiuri Shimbun said, "We will wait silently for the results of his final efforts." The Mainichi Shimbun doubted that the dispatch of Kurusu to the United States would improve the opportunity for US-Japan meetings. It is very dangerous to be optimistic in this situation. Kurusu's appointment proves Japan's sincere efforts to maintain peace in the Pacific, and also proves that Japan's foreign policy has not changed. The Kokumin Shimbun made a stern comment, saying that Japan's policy will not change due to Kurusu's visit to the United States, but will be even more firmly established than before. This should be noted by the United States and its allies. It is also something that Japan cannot forget. If the United States believes that the encirclement policy is enough to make Japan abandon its established policy, it is a fallacy. If the United States experiences this opportunity to maintain peace in the Pacific and achieves a satisfactory solution, then the United States will benefit more than Japan.

### Personnel Coming to China to Serve to Organize International Air Force to Assist China in Defending the Burma Road and Britain Re-Deploys Far East Defenses

Reuters, London, 8th - Sources say that intelligence circles do not dismiss the possibility hinted at by the Japanese newspaper *Hiroshima Times* that Japanese troops will head directly to Yunnan Province. It is believed that opinions are being exchanged between the United Kingdom and its Dominions. The *New Statesman* discusses the status of the Pacific, stating that it is unsurprising that Japan continues to attempt to blockade the Burma Road and intensify the blockade of China through diplomatic means to prevent American supplies. Although high mountains and dense forests may be a formidable obstacle to the Japanese army's advance, the outcome of the war also depends on the strength of the air force. Therefore, the capitals of the United Kingdom are carefully considering plans to replenish the Chinese Air Force. According to news from Washington, the idea of the United States taking over the maintenance of the Burma Road is under consideration. Furthermore, diplomatic correspondents report that China's ability to defend this road largely depends on the air force. Therefore, all possible steps to increase international aid to the Chinese Air Force will be taken. This international air force will be composed of personnel from various countries who sympathize with China's war. Although Japanese envoy Kurusu is currently flying to the United States for mediation, news from Washington is pessimistic about the US-Japan negotiations. The *Times* correspondent in Washington reports that the US Secretary of the Navy stated that a conflict with Japan in the Pacific, while not inevitable, seems imminent. If Japan insists that the United States abandon its well-known obligations in China and the South Pacific, the United States will refuse, regardless of the cost. Another message from Washington states that unless Japan drastically changes its policy, no matter how many final proposals it makes or how many negotiators it sends to Washington, it will inevitably fail. Therefore, the British Empire is now doing its best to strengthen its defenses in the Far East, regardless of the progress of the talks in Washington. According to a dispatch from Singapore, a large convoy carrying reinforcements has arrived there, and the British Empire is now re-planning its defenses in the Pacific. This is probably related to the visit of Indian Commander-in-Chief General Wavell to the Far East. General Wavell promised to have the Indian Army cooperate more closely with Singapore and continue to send reinforcements. The British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East, Brooke-Popham, is taking certain steps, such as abandoning the scorched earth policy for some isolated British outposts in the Pacific. Previously, it was believed that these outposts could not be defended for long, but now it has been decided to build one of the important outposts as a fortress in the Pacific defense line.

The United Kingdom Should Defend the Lifelines of China and the Soviet Union

Reuters, Singapore, 8th - The *Singapore Free Press* discusses the overall situation in the Far East, stating that the United States, Britain, China, and the Netherlands should form a clear alliance. It states that Vladivostok and the Burma Road are of utmost importance and must be defended by the United Kingdom. Other important places include Singapore, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies. The reason why the United Kingdom must defend Vladivostok is that the Soviet Union relies on it to transport supplies during its war in Europe, and Siberia can directly threaten the heart of Japan. The reason why the Burma Road must be defended is that it is China's lifeline, without which China may not be able to fight for long and achieve victory. The article states that there is no doubt that all of the above locations must be defended if attacked. The political circles refused to comment on the question of whether one or several of the United States, Britain, China, and the Netherlands would go to war if Vladivostok or the Burma Road were attacked. While acknowledging that such an attack would greatly change the situation in the Far East and would be a matter of concern for all free nations, it stated that any decision to take military action outside the borders of the United States, Britain, China, and the Netherlands involves important political considerations. Such important political issues, even if they involve purely strategic issues, cannot be decided by local personnel and must be decided by the domestic government.

United Press, London, 8th - The Air Ministry announced yesterday that the American-made "Brewster Buffalo" aircraft driven by the Royal Air Force in Malaya "are sufficient to defeat any enemy that may be encountered in the Far East."

United Press, Washington, 8th - Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that the Swedish capital's radio report that American troops had gone to Yunnan and Burma was just another of Germany's propaganda tactics. He said that the absurdity of the German reports meant that the reports issued by Berlin's propaganda machine would soon not be believed by the public.

Editorial

### "Striving for Victory Through Close Cooperation"

President Chiang Kai-shek, in an interview with foreign reporters the day before yesterday, strongly emphasized the obvious benefits of mutual solidarity among the free nations, and stated that even greater efforts should be made in the future to strive for final victory through close cooperation. This, along with President Roosevelt's statement the day before yesterday, that "the heroic stand of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union will receive the full support of the free people of the Americas," and that "the United States must supply China, Britain, and the Soviet Union with armaments, and must do so today," can be said to have the same purpose and coincide without prior consultation. At this point in time, if we want to suppress the arrogance of the aggressive front and prevent the expansion of aggressive disasters, it can be said that no single country has the assurance of winning alone except for the combined efforts of all freedom-loving countries in the world. China, Britain, and the Soviet Union are fighting separately, which is related to the survival of the nation, and of course, no more slackness is allowed. Even in the United States, although it has not officially participated in the war, it has in fact long become the future target of aggressors, so it must also fully assist its comrades to avoid the danger of shared destruction. Based on this simple reason of shared weal and woe and interconnected interests, it can be seen that President Chiang's optimism about the future of cooperation among the free nations and President Roosevelt's declaration of willingness to fully assist China, Britain, and the Soviet Union are not empty propaganda or intimidation tactics commonly used by the Axis countries, but facts that are true and credible.

On the other hand, the aggressive front, although it has also felt the need to strengthen its collusion in order to echo each other from east to west and realize its so-called "joint action," but in essence, what they are doing is all unjust acts of murder and robbery. On the one hand, there are the benefits of cooperation, but on the other hand, there are also the risks of cooperation. In case of unsuccessful cooperation, it is easy to take the blame for others or suffer joint disaster. This is why Germany is eager for Japan to take action, but Japan is still putting on airs and does not dare to go deep. This is truly incomparable to the great spirit of wholeheartedness and eternal cooperation among the free nations.

Most ridiculously, Japan has always been evasive about its interpretation of Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact and refuses to make a positive statement. As a foreign observer said, the Tokyo government has avoided responsibility for this alliance at least twice: the first time was when Germany began its war against the Soviet Union and Japan took no action, and the second time was recently after the USS *Rubin James* incident, when Germany insisted that the United States attacked first, implying that Japan could invoke the alliance, but as a result, Japan remained deaf and dumb and showed the same retreat. From this, it can be seen that what Japan cares about is only its own interests, so what it promotes is only the so-called "independence and autonomy," an diplomacy that is not bound by the alliance. As of now, the only obligation it has fulfilled to its allies is limited to issuing some irresponsible tough slogans from time to time, or continuing to make some intimidating military preparations in the North and South Pacific. But in fact, what it is most concerned about now is still conducting diplomatic negotiations with the United States—that is, the enemy of its European allies. In order to make a "last effort," it even sent Kurusu, who once represented the Japanese government in signing the Tripartite Pact, to the United States to assist Nomura in handling these negotiations. In Hitler's mind, this should have aroused a somewhat different feeling.

Although Japan disregards the interests of its allies and is eager to reach a compromise with the United States alone, its ambition and shortsightedness have blinded it, preventing it from recognizing reality, preventing it from understanding that the free nations have long had a common position, and preventing it from seeing the bond of shared weal and woe among the free nations. According to the seven principles published in the *Hiroshima Times* the other day, what Japan hopes from the United States is not only to help it resolve the "China Incident," but also to recognize the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," so-called having both the fish and the bear's paw, all of which it desires. However, asking the United States to help resolve the China Incident is tantamount to asking the United States to sacrifice China. This is because Japan has overlooked the fact that China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have long been united. Asking the United States to recognize the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is tantamount to asking the United States to withdraw from the Far East and abandon its consistent anti-aggression policy. This is again because Japan has forgotten the promises that President Roosevelt has repeatedly made to the free nations. Therefore, no matter how enthusiastic the Tokyo government is about negotiations, and no matter who it sends as a special envoy to the United States for mediation, as long as its fundamental policy does not change, it will never be able to obtain concrete results, and the greatest effect of continuing negotiations will be at most to delay the time.

However, judging from the clear and resolute statements of the leaders of the United States and China, it is not difficult for the world to imagine that even if Japan wants to delay the time in the future, it will probably be unable to shake the established situation of mutual solidarity among the free nations, and it will be even more impossible to ease the determination of the United States to step up its assistance to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Not only will it be unable to do so, but perhaps President Chiang's prediction of "striving for victory through close cooperation" will eventually come true.

### Dutch East Indies Expands Naval Base; New Surabaya Naval Port Has Been Completed and Torpedo Boats Are Being Built in Rapid Succession

United Press, Surabaya, 8th - The area of ​​Surabaya's naval base has doubled in the last nine months. This is the Dutch effort to make the Dutch East Indies defense unbreakable. A brand new naval port has been built there, and a wharf about half a mile long is also under construction, which can accommodate several warships. A camp that can accommodate 25,000 soldiers is also nearing completion, and at least twelve new machine shops have been completed. In addition, the authorities are also building another naval port to accommodate small warships. At least the reporter did not see the above points when he came here nine months ago. No less than thousands of additional native workers participated in the work. Torpedo boats are being built in rapid succession, and mine-laying boats and patrol ships are also expected to be completed and launched quickly. Many cruisers and destroyers in the base are being re-equipped to enable the ships to exert greater power in defending the East Indies. There are many safe air-raid shelters. Every day from 6 am to 3 pm, the sound of the equipment working in the factories and machine rooms is deafening. Fast boats traveling 40 nautical miles per hour can be seen everywhere on the sea. This kind of torpedo speedboat has become a strong defensive weapon of the Dutch East Indies Navy. On Madura Island, opposite the Surabaya Sea, there are more naval ammunition factories, all built underground, with no danger of being destroyed. The dock is stationed with the latest submarines.

### Japanese Overseas Nationals Withdraw One After Another

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 8th - A Japanese ship left Yokohama for Singapore yesterday to bring back Japanese nationals there. As for the withdrawal of foreigners from Japan, it is currently impossible.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 8th - According to the *Nichi Nichi Shimbun*, the Japanese Consul-General in Yangon has requested the Japanese merchants in Myanmar to withdraw. At the same time, the Japanese Foreign Ministry announced that three Japanese ships sailed from Canada, the United States, and the Hawaiian Islands to Japan, carrying a total of 1,687 American and Japanese passengers.

### Japanese War Preparation Frenzy; Cannon Fire More Important Than Church Bells; Metals Collected from All Over the Country

Havas News Agency, Tokyo, 7th - In order to collect metals, the Japanese government stipulated that the temple's sacrificial bells, lanterns, and other metal objects must be melted down for national defense purposes. A professor at Tokyo Imperial University published an article in the *Asahi Shimbun*, admitting that the sound of cannon fire is more important than church bells today, but urged the government to pay attention to preserving items of historical and religious value.

### Rumor that Vietnamese Railroad Traffic Taken Over by Japanese; Vietnamese Authorities Deny

Havas News Agency, Hanoi, Vietnam, 7th - The rumor that all road and railroad traffic lines in Vietnam have been taken over by the Japanese has been firmly denied by the authorities.

### Panama Repels Japanese; Japanese Protest Rejected

United Press, Tokyo, 8th - The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Japan had filed a protest on the first of this month against Panama's discriminatory treatment of Japanese nationals, but was rejected. Therefore, the protest was filed again yesterday. He said that Panama has promulgated new laws restricting Japanese commercial and agricultural activities in Panama. Japan, for the sake of all Asian nations, cannot simply ignore it. The spokesperson pointed out that the strict implementation of Panama's laws was due to American pressure, and claimed that Japan hoped that the Panamanian government could restore its independent policy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement accusing Panama, saying that Panama's expulsion of Japanese nationals, while allowing Chinese enterprises to continue operating such businesses, was an illegal discriminatory treatment. Although Panama nominally recognizes that yellow people are not welcome in the country, in practice, it only expels Japanese nationals. Regardless of the special status of Panama, this act is an unprecedented inhumane move.

### After the Completion of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, Foreign Trade Will Be More Convenient; Goods Can Enter and Exit Through Bhamo and Lashio; Freight on the Yunnan-Burma Highway Will Not Be Congested

Chongqing - A special correspondent sent a long letter, recording the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, saying that there are continuous high mountains, deep valleys full of miasma, and wide rapid currents along the way, which must be climbed, penetrated, or crossed. The various difficulties in the project must be overcome, so the railway is almost a miraculous railway, and will be a major project, giving China a second supply lifeline in the west, so that lend-lease supplies can be continuously and quickly transported in. This will also realize China's old dream of connecting Central China to India, the Middle East, and Europe by railway, so as to shorten travel time. Moreover, the railway will open up a wider and lesser-known area than the Yunnan-Burma Highway, and will go further north. In the future, when it is completed, European and American goods will take this new route and be transported into the Chinese mainland through Province, or through Bhamo's Irrawaddy , or through Yangon, and back to the base of lend-lease supplies, Lashio. Then, the transportation on the Burma Highway will not be congested, and China's white jade, silk goods, and spices can also be continuously transported to Bhamo, which is where the items were transported by horses by merchants traveling along the small path along today's Yunnan-Burma Highway 1,500 years ago.

### Review of the Delineated and Undelineated Sections of the Yunnan-Burma Border

— Tan Lian

Therefore, the northern section of the border line, whether it is Gaolianggong Mountain, Gaoligong Mountain, Xiaojiang En Hai, or Kaijiang, are all place names of national humiliation and loss of sovereignty in diplomatic history. It can be said that they are ominous place names and should be abolished and not used in the redrawing of the border line. Even the Five-Colored Border Line, not a single one has the qualifications to be a national border and should all be overturned. Because the foremost line of the Five-Colored Border Line, which is the original line set by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is also on the east bank of the Enmeikai River, which has already demarcated the Jiangxinpo and the Savage Mountain areas west of the Mailikai River outside the border. Other lines are even less worth discussing. The most important basis for our country's future border demarcation should be to take the entire Savage Mountain area as the only stronghold. Except for the part of the Savage Mountain area that has been demarcated into Myanmar according to previous treaties, the rest of the Savage Mountain area should belong to us, and no concession should be made even for a foot of land. Once the principle is established, the evidence of the old allegiance of the various Tusi to us should be presented to make a thorough solution. Yi Mingde, a member of the Southern Section Border Survey Committee, previously investigated the undelineated Yunnan-Burma border, and after returning, wrote the Suggestions for Handling the Northern Section of the Yunnan-Burma Border Affairs, and proposed another line for reference for the undelineated area north of Jangaogao Mountain: The line starts from Jiangaogao Mountain, follows the Shie River, passes west through Panyao, follows the southern boundary of Hugong, to the Nayou tribe and the junction of Manipur and Assam, and then follows the Bakhai Mountain Longgangduo Mountain at the junction of Hugong Kanddi and Assam, straight to the junction of Xikang and Assam, including Hugong Kanddi Savage Mountain Qiuyi Langsu Chashan and other departments, in order to curb the British attempt to enter Kangzang from northern Myanmar. Professor Bai Meichu also proposed a line, which starts from Myitkyina, draws a line eastward to Jiangaotong, then draws a line westward from Myitkyina to Mong Gong, and then goes northwest, following the watershed between the Mailikai River and the Yarlung Tsangpo River, and goes north, straight to the Xikang border. Compared with Yi's proposed line, Bai's line expands southward, reaching Myitkyina to Mong Gong, and the southern end is larger than Yi's line; however, it only uses the three words "watershed" to describe the northward direction following the watershed between the Mailikai Yarlung Tsangpo River, without explaining the name of the mountain range, whether it refers to the Savage Mountains near the Nayou tribe; or to the Savage Mountains of Kumun Ridge; it cannot be proven and is easy to cause misunderstanding. In the past, during the Sino-British border negotiations, the word "watershed" was argued until the lips were parched and the tongue was dry, and it should be taken as a lesson for the future; do not use ambiguous nouns again, causing future disputes. Moreover, the British have been operating in Mong Gong and other places at the southern end for a long time, and it may not be easy to make him withdraw. In the future, when demarcating the border line, it would be great if the southern end could be proposed according to Bai's line; the western end is still clear according to Yi's line. Based on this, and then put forward what Myanmar itself said, "Myanmar once managed the land east of the river, until the confluence of the Enmeikai River and the Mailikai River." Blame him for demarcating the border at the confluence of the two rivers, which shows that the area north of the confluence is not Myanmar's territory and cannot be ceded at all, let alone the area west of the river. If this goal can be achieved, the proposal made by Envoy Xue in the past to take the watershed of the Mailikai and Enmeikai Rivers as the boundary will naturally be canceled invisibly. Fortunately, the Sino-British negotiations did not conclude any treaties, and we can still argue based on reason; otherwise, if we are bound by the treaty, the land will have become a fait accompli and we will not be able to have a say.

In the past, Xue Bian's diplomatic efforts could not be said to be completely lacking; only because of a mistake in not being familiar with the geography of the border areas, and a mistake in not being able to compete with others in terms of national strength, wanting to win with words, the effect was naturally very small. Now that our country's international status has increased since the Anti-Japanese War, and China and Britain are standing on the side of democracy, with closely related interests, the diplomatic relations are very close, far from what they used to be. If there are domestic diplomats who are good at responding to changes, and are assisted by talents who are familiar with the geography of the border areas, they will naturally have a clear understanding of border affairs and be well-prepared, and everything will be unconstrained, and they can negotiate as much as possible, and the difficulties will be easily solved. Therefore, it can be said that this border demarcation has begun to have a bright path, and continuous efforts to identify the road line will lead to the bright avenue. (To be continued)

### Eastern Front War Enters 21st Week; Red Army in the Central Region Changes from Defense to Offense; Moscow Perimeter Battle Situation Greatly Improves; German Attack on Crimea Meets Strong Resistance

Reuters, London, 8th - The 20th week of the Soviet-German War ended today. News came that Soviet troops had launched fierce counterattacks west and northwest of Moscow, and German troops had won a victory at the eastern end of Crimea. According to a *Pravda* reporter, street fighting is now taking place northeast of Galining City, 100 miles northeast of Moscow. Soviet military operations to eliminate a German troop in the vicinity of Volynsk are continuing. Soviet troops in and around Mozhaisk are still engaged in counterattacks. There is no real change in the war situation in the three districts of Maloyaroslavets, Shipkov, and Naro-Fominsk.

Reuters, London, 8th - According to dispatches from the front, although the Germans have exerted all their strength to reach Moscow before the arrival of winter, they have not made great progress in recent days, and the area currently occupied by the Germans does not seem to be closer to Moscow than it was two weeks ago. It is believed that the bad weather is currently hindering the Germans' actions. In some places, especially in the Volokolamsk district, the fierce counterattack by the Soviet army has improved its position. The German High Command broke its silence on the war situation on the Moscow front last night. In the Crimean Peninsula, the German side admitted to encountering strong resistance and mentioned "passable mountain areas." There is currently little new news coming from the Donets Basin. Regarding Stalin's claim of German losses, the official German news agency replied that as of October 31, Soviet losses had reached 7.8 million.

Moscow Square Holds Grand Review; Stalin Encourages Red Army Soldiers

Reuters, London, 8th - The most interesting news from yesterday was the dispatch from Moscow. Although the city is not far from the attacking German troops and is threatened by German aircraft, the Red Army still held a grand exercise to commemorate the 24th anniversary of the October Revolution. Stalin spoke with a calm conviction. (See another dispatch for the speech.) The fact that hundreds of Soviet tanks participated in the exercise seems to indicate that the Soviet army in Moscow does not lack military supplies. The weather is still quite unfavorable, with wind and snow, which puts the troops to a severe test of endurance.

TASS, Moscow, 8th - The Red Army held a review in Red Square to commemorate the Soviet October Revolution. Stalin delivered a speech, saying, "We are currently fighting against the Nazis along the entire line. Twenty-three years ago, when we first celebrated the anniversary of the October Revolution, we had no allies. At that time, the Red Army was not strong and was still in the initial stage of organization. There were neither sufficient military equipment nor military supplies. Now we have united allies and have the support of the people of Europe who are under Nazi sanctions. We will surely win the final victory. Who can doubt it? There is already a feeling of anger among the people of Europe and the German people. German invaders have exerted their last strength to fight. Comrades, the whole world is watching you. The countries under Nazi sanctions are hoping that you will liberate them. You have been entrusted with the great mission of liberating the masses. Under the banner of Lenin, may you move forward and strive for victory!"

### U.S. Prepares to Use Massive Funds to Defeat Nazi and Fascist Ideologies; Advises Finland to Ceasefire with the Soviet Union; Content of U.S.-Finland Talks Released

Washington, 8th (Reuters) – Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that the U.S. has not yet received a reply from the Finnish government after informing Finland that it would lose American friendship if it did not cease its offensive against the Soviet Union.

The record of Hull's October 3rd conversation with the Finnish Minister to the U.S. has now been released. It states that Hull informed the Finnish government that he was pleased to hear that Finland had recovered its lost territories. However, Hitler is now employing barbaric methods, seeking to conquer the world. The question now is whether Finland will be satisfied with recovering its lost territories and pursue a ceasefire, or whether it will continue to advance and participate in the general war between Germany and the Soviet Union on Hitler's side. The United States is prepared, if necessary, to use $75,000,000,000 to assist in resisting Hitler and his ideology and eradicating it.

A memorandum of Deputy Secretary of State Welles' conversation with the Finnish Minister includes Welles' statement that the Soviet Union is prepared to negotiate a new peace treaty with Finland, and that the Soviet Union will grant land concessions to Finland, but this does not imply Soviet weakness. According to official information and other evidence obtained by the United States, the Soviet Union is indeed prepared to resist Germany to the end, and as far as the U.S. government knows, there are indeed reasons to believe that the Soviet Union will continue to resist for a long time. The Finnish Minister asked what guarantees Britain and the United States could provide to Finland to ensure that the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty would be maintained even after Germany's defeat, and whether the Soviet Union would respect the promises given by Britain and the United States and not attempt to seize Finland again. Welles replied that such questions could only arise after Finland was willing to study the possibility of making peace. He questioned whether Finland believed it could obtain guarantees or promises to preserve its autonomy after a German victory, fearing that Finland would have no one to turn to at that time. If Germany is defeated, what need has Finland to worry about friends?

Finns Tired of War, Germany Uneasy

London, 8th (Reuters) – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that a broadcast in English on Thursday night by the Finnish Lai-Ti wireless station, stating that "as far as Finland is concerned, military actions are now coming to an end," has clearly made Germany very uneasy. Berlin issued contradictory denials of this news yesterday, stating that according to news from the German News Agency in Finland, the Finnish radio station did not make this announcement. Another German source provided a more detailed account, acknowledging that Finland had ceased hostilities in the Karelia region it had recovered. London believes that the sentiment expressed by the Finnish broadcaster on Thursday night undoubtedly represents the opinion of the majority of the Finnish people. The broadcaster did not give his name, and the beginning of the broadcast was not heard. London officials are aware that it would be unwise to overemphasize this broadcast. However, the most noteworthy point is the anxiety caused to listeners by the Finnish hint that it may no longer serve their interests.

### British Aid to the Soviet Union is Not Thorough; Opening a Second Front Still Awaits; But Significant Blows Have Been Dealt to Germany in the Air War

London, 8th (Reuters) – A Reuters air force correspondent reports that although Britain has not yet been able to open a second land front to aid the Soviet Union, it has indeed fully struck Germany in the second air front. This is the new and significant meaning of the work of the British Air Force's Bomber, Fighter, and Coastal Commands in Western Europe during the six months from May to October this year. Recent official and semi-official documents can prove the following undeniable reasons: During the above six-month period, the Bomber Command alone dropped more than 20,000 tons of bombs on Germany and its occupied territories, far exceeding the same period last year, and inevitably increasing the damage to Germany's war machine. The Coastal and Fighter Commands sank or destroyed 332 enemy ships, which is the most significant blow to Germany's maritime resources since the start of the war, as the supply of German troops on both the eastern and western fronts depends on these ships. The Fighter and Bomber Commands have tied down half of the German Air Force's fighter strength, preventing them from operating in the Soviet Union. The tens of thousands of flights by the Coastal and Fighter Commands to protect Allied ships have made an indelible contribution to ensuring the continuous flow of American supplies to Britain and the Soviet Union.

### Ministry Orders Provincial Education Bureaus to Strictly Examine Secondary School Teachers and Find Ways to Produce Scientific Instruments to Meet Urgent Needs

(Chongqing Dispatch) Educational administrative authorities are actively focusing on strengthening secondary education. The Ministry of Education recently issued a special order to provincial education bureaus to strictly examine secondary school teachers, and those who are unqualified should be immediately dismissed. Short-term training classes for secondary school teachers should be organized to increase teachers' opportunities for further study.

For example, the newly established Sixteenth and Seventeenth Middle Schools are reorganized from these middle school classes. Regarding the management of national middle schools, in order to facilitate management in the future, the number of students in each school will be limited to prevent it from being too large. Branch schools previously established by various schools have been ordered to be abolished as much as possible in order to concentrate management. In addition, the Ministry of Education is cooperating with the Sichuan Provincial Education Bureau to find ways to manufacture scientific instruments themselves, hoping to produce them in large quantities to meet urgent educational needs. In addition, it is reported that a batch of books and instruments ordered by universities in the rear from the United States has recently arrived in Yangon and is being transported inland.

### Guang Gang Procures Miscellaneous Brands of Yarn; Double Horse Re-emerges with 3,000 Yuan Barrier

Yesterday's yarn market, which had declined, rebounded again today. This was due to the rebound in gold prices, which improved sentiment. At the same time, factories are reducing working days more and more drastically, and the number of Double Horse yarns coming out is gradually decreasing. Therefore, some large players are still thinking of buying at low prices. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse factory singles this morning was 2,940 yuan due to poor sentiment in the afternoon, which made the public tend to be bearish, a drop of 85 yuan compared to the previous day. Soon after, it was lowered to 2,925 yuan. However, as soon as the low appeared, the shorts were eager to cover their positions, and the momentum suddenly turned bullish. At the same time, gold prices were reported to be rising again. As a result, buyers came one after another, and the market rose steadily. The peak once reached 3,060 yuan. Afterwards, it was heard that the exchange had finalized the grades of miscellaneous yarns, and it should be able to resume business next Monday. As a result, shorts became active and exerted pressure. The closing price was 3,020 yuan.

The grade table of the Double Horse Exchange has been published and excerpted as follows: 20-count special Jin Cheng equal product 23-count Golden Rooster plus 30 yuan, Da Fa plus 20 yuan, Tian Nu minus 40 yuan, Double Earth minus 110 yuan, 20-count Samsung minus 130 yuan, Wu Fu minus 130 yuan, Mu Yang minus 130 yuan.

Other brands generally subtract 100 yuan, with the lowest subtracting 140 yuan. Only designated factory singles can be delivered, and foreign factories are not included in this example.

The spot yarn situation is good, and the trend continues to be strong. This is because Guang Gang suddenly came to collect 20-count Wu Fu, Mu Yang, Samsung, and 32-count Wu Fu, Mu Yang, and other yarns, totaling about 300 to 400 bales. As a result, sentiment was boosted, and buying interest was strong. Some people say that because the price of Japanese yarn is surprisingly hard, the price of 20-count upper-grade yarn is above 3,120 yuan, and the price of middle-grade yarn is also between 3,040 and 3,050 yuan, and the supply is quite tight. However, recently, the price of coarse cotton has seen a slight rebound. It is said that the average price of raw materials for spinning 20-count yarn is currently between 800 yuan and 850 yuan per 100 catties. Spinning one bale requires 350 catties of materials. The shorts also argue that if the situation in the Pacific becomes tense, the yarn market will be unstable. It is estimated that the turnover in half a day was 700 bales, and the market rose by 50 to 60 yuan.

The Double Horse futures market went from a sharp rise to a slight pullback, and the situation suddenly reversed to bullish. When it opened in the morning, it first opened in the dark market with factory singles and then gradually advanced. It once reached a high of over 3,050 yuan, and because general investors believed that the overseas prospects would be more promising, they absorbed more. When the futures yarn opened, the number of buyers suddenly increased. Coupled with the shorts covering their positions, the market was temporarily controlled by buying interest. The opening price for November revealed a rising edge of 1,830 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. Afterwards, after the pull-up by the buyers and the covering by the shorts, it once reached a high of 2,920 yuan. Since gold prices rose and sentiment became more upward, December opened at a high price of 3,100 yuan, a sudden increase of 133 yuan. January was 3,150 yuan, also a good increase of 96 yuan. Afterwards, it hovered, and the footing was still strong. Although it later weakened slightly due to the sale of floating positions, there was no sign of weakness. As a result of the fluctuations in half a day, they all rebounded by more than 60 yuan to more than 100 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon. The list is as follows:

November December January Opening 2830.0 3100.0 3150.0 Highest 2920.0 3100.0 3160.0 Lowest 2820.0 3035.0 3096.0 Closing 2910.0 3065.0 3120.0 Comparison Rise 100.0 Rise 23.0 Rise 66.0

The spot cotton situation is slightly weak, and coarse cotton has fallen by more than 10 yuan, but fine cotton is still strong.

Brazilian 300 pieces 1375.0 Gongda entered Langgong 100 pieces 728.0 Haojia and 300 pieces 726.0 and Aomula 200 pieces 730.0 and and 100 pieces 735.0 and

The New York cotton market first rose due to purchases by Wall Street and peers, then fell slightly due to sales by New Orleans and profit-taking by longs, and finally rose again due to purchases by spot traders and short covering. Yesterday's closing price rose by 13 to 17 points each compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market first rose due to short covering, and then fell due to the tense situation in the Far East and sales by European exporters. As a result, yesterday's closing price rose by about 2 rupees. It is also predicted that the market will open higher by 1 rupee today.

In addition, it is reported that Indian cotton transshipped through Hong Kong. Yihua Yangxing's Yuan Niu ship arrived in port yesterday, loaded with 700 pieces of cotton from Hong Kong, which was produced in India.

### Leading Fine Cloth Wants to Rise But Falls Instead; Exchange Will Change Colored Ball to Standard

The factory cloth fell and then rebounded. This was because the price of cloth had fallen in the downstream in recent days, which aroused the buying intention of buyers. However, due to the weekend, the turnover was still weak. As a result, the price of cloth was flat, and some rebounded by about 1 yuan per piece. More than 300 pieces were traded on this street.

Dong cloth wanted to rise but fell instead, and the situation revolved. The highest price of Longtou fine cloth factory singles was shouted at 116 to 117 yuan, and it fell to 113.5 yuan at noon. The peak of Sijunzi Bigi was 4 yuan 012 points, and the closing price was 3 yuan 97.5 cents. The process was calm. There was no market in the afternoon as usual. It is heard that the exchange's futures cloth has been scheduled to resume business and auctioning with colored ball fine cloth as the standard. In its grade table, those who deliver with Longtou are raised by 7.5 yuan.

### Lining for Woolen Fabrics is Scarce and Expensive

Woolen fabric lining, recently affected by the rising prices of raw silk yarn, various grades of goods have reported rising prices. Because the profit margin of this military is thin, most of the products of general manufacturers have been delayed. There are also manufacturers who do not care about their reputation and are unwilling to deliver the goods that were originally scheduled to be opened due to losses. At present, Western clothing gangs are selling well, and the market's digestion is very healthy. Silk-glossy feather yarn, rubber, glossy satin, brown satin, printed cloth, soft lining, pocket cloth, French lining, and black charcoal lining were all sold at high prices yesterday due to the shortage of goods. Datong silk-glossy feather yarn was sold for 4.5 yuan, Hua Xiangpi satin for 8 yuan, Yongcheng electro-optic satin for 7 yuan, Changming Guangming satin for 5 yuan, Lianxin Ma brown satin for 5 yuan, Hongsheng printed cloth for 4.8 yuan, Gongping soft lining for 2.7 yuan, Yuan Ji Sheng French lining for 1.6 yuan, and Meitai black charcoal lining for 9.5 yuan.

### In the Face of Competition by all Sides, Burned Red is Exhausted

One and a Half Hours to Raise 1150 Yuan: Yesterday's cash burned red dark market suddenly rebounded, having returned outside the 20,000 yuan mark, and twice again leaped to outside of 21,000 yuan. According to the uncertainty of great hearts on all sides, the buying momentum of a couple of banks has resumed, a certain securities firm has covered shorts, the Hong Kong gang also has absorption, and the chips on the counter again felt exhausted.

The burned red spot market opened at 9 am, and immediately rose by 200 yuan in the buying wind, to 19,900 yuan. Russia continued to rise in the buying momentum. Chengji, Decheng, Defu, Xiangxingyong, Xianghe, Tianyuan, Dafeng Hengji, Chengda, and Mingfeng tilted in. Sellers watched. The price then leaped straight up, stepping up 1,150 yuan, coaxing to 21,050 yuan. After 9:30, Dafeng and Xiangxingyong re-entered, and Defu and Shunyuan especially surged. It was actually a coax of 300 yuan, reaching 21,100 yuan. It was sold by Chengji Xianghe Tianyuan, a small 500 yuan, retreating to 20,600 yuan.

### Diminishing Need for the Black Market Exchange

Foreign Exchange: Yesterday's market saw no change in the official rates of the Central Bank and HSBC. HSBC's small counter rates remained stagnant. The black market rates for British and American currencies were relatively stable. Importers of non-essential goods showed little interest. Although some Chinese merchants offered US dollars at 2.625 and 2.75 yuan, there were few buyers. At 11:10 AM, wealthy individuals purchased tens of thousands from Chinese speculators at a rate of 19,879 (market price). British exchange was settling at 2 shillings and 1 pence, and US exchange at 3 yuan, the same as the previous day. No market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Japanese and Korean gold notes rose sharply, with the former reaching 4.1 yuan and the latter rising to 4 yuan.

### Foreign Rice and Foreign Exchange Available; Decline in Rice Prices is Natural

Yesterday, due to the decision of the Price Equalization Fund to provide foreign exchange for the maximum limit of rice imports needed each month, estimated at 250,000 bags, with a total value of 40 million yuan in national currency, which is sufficient to meet the city's demand, and with incoming shipments arriving one after another, and the concession authorities also tightening supervision, rumors and unfavorable factors combined, leading to a rush to sell by large firms, hoarders, and small speculators alike as the market opened. With few buyers, prices plummeted all the way down until the market closed, without any sign of recovery. No. 1 Saigon rice fell from 193 yuan to 188 yuan, No. 2 from 180 yuan to 175 yuan, No. 1 Siamese rice from 181-2 yuan to 180 yuan, No. 2 to 170 yuan, French Hua Jian rice to 184-5 yuan, Min Dang Gao rice from 180 yuan, then to 175 yuan, Small Jiao rice from 160 yuan, fell to 155-6 yuan, then 153-4 yuan, to 151 yuan, Broken Jian rice from 136 yuan, fell to 133-4 yuan, a continuous decline of 3-5 yuan compared to before. The British-Chinese company saw small Jiao rice at 193.5 yuan initially, then 180 yuan, but later there were few buyers, with 27,000 bags and 600 tons traded.

Large quantities of foreign rice continue to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Yuan Sheng and Ming Sheng vessels arrived simultaneously, both carrying foreign rice. The Yuan Sheng vessel carried 8,100 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which was the municipal council's price-controlled rice. The Ming Sheng vessel carried 17,220 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, of which 10,500 bags were the municipal council's price-controlled rice, and the rest were commercial goods. Both vessels docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading, hence the decline in rice prices is natural. (Zu)

Local rice market: Thick and thin japonica rice shops on this street are slightly [difficult to describe]. However, due to limited arrivals, sellers are not willing to sell at low prices. As a result, prices only softened slightly following foreign rice. Early and late rice from Nan Gang opened at 205 yuan, then fell to 198 yuan. New Kunshan japonica rice ranged from 206 yuan to 203 yuan. Qing Jiao Rong Zhong rice ranged from 205 yuan to 200 yuan. Du Jian rice was priced at 190 yuan, with little trading activity. Due to the scarcity of foreign glutinous rice in the market, the base price was quite firm. Therefore, although foreign rice prices fell, it was able to sustain, without showing prosperity or decline. Continued sales of Hong Kong glutinous rice ranged from 222 yuan to 218 yuan. Glutinous rice tea was priced at 204-5 yuan. Local glutinous rice sales were sluggish, with no trading reported.

### Noodle Market Unable to Support the Decline

Yesterday, the price of foreign noodles followed the decline of foreign rice. Actual sales were low, and buyers were particularly hesitant. The realization of the price-controlled noodle policy is imminent, and both the drop in rice prices and rumors of negative news are unfavorable to large firms and hoarders. Therefore, those seeking quick profits were the first to sell off, and large firms secretly released their holdings, causing the market to collapse. Golden Dragon noodles initially opened at 54.5 yuan, then fell slightly. Later, sellers offered prices at 53.5 yuan, but there were still few buyers. Therefore, the market may have to weaken further.

### Stagnant Actual Sales of Coarse Grains

The black market trading of coarse grains was still dull yesterday. There were few buyers for actual sales, and the attitude of buyers was generally lax. Therefore, the market continued to decline. Qingdao raw oil was priced at 392 yuan, Qin Shan factory rapeseed oil at 261 yuan, Tianjin Jin Yuan at 102 yuan, Jiaozhou yellow beans at 107 yuan, Chongming sandworms at 61 yuan, Dutch yellow corn at 40 yuan to 47.5 yuan, white corn at 47 yuan to 46.5 yuan, and Saigon new corn at 59.5 yuan to 59 yuan. October shipments were priced at 90.05 yuan, and November shipments at 91 yuan.

### Government Bond Trading Concentrated on Class C Bonds; Retreats and Advances around the 6 Yuan Mark; Wheelock & Co. Pays Interim Dividend

Government bond unofficial market: Yesterday, Sichuan bankers did not continue selling, but due to depressed sentiment, sellers were still very active. Class C bonds retreated and advanced around the 6 yuan mark, ultimately closing within the 6 yuan range, indicating fierce competition between both sides. Activity was concentrated on Class C bonds, followed by Class E bonds. Yesterday was Saturday, and the market opened at 11:00 AM, with only one session. Class C bonds opened slightly lower at 4.5 yuan, with the opening price settling at 5.8 yuan. Thereafter, buyers and sellers competed fiercely around the 6 yuan mark, and after breaking through 6 yuan five or six times, it ultimately closed within the range. The sentiment appeared to be dominated by short sellers. Lian Yi Sheng, Da Heng Kang, and retail investors bought, while Hong Da, Yi Tai, Tong Shun, and Jiu Feng sold. As a result, except for Class D bonds, which saw no trading at all, other types declined by a small amount of 0.05 to 0.3-0.4 yuan. Approximately 1.2-1.3 million yuan was traded. A summary table is listed below:
Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day
---|---|---|---|---
Unified Class A | 72.90 | 72.60 | 72.60 | Down 0.05
Unified Class B | 68.40 | 67.60 | 67.60 | Up 0.30
Unified Class C | 66.20 | 65.80 | 65.85 | Up 0.40
Unified Class E | 66.10 | 65.90 | 65.00 | Down 0.1

Stock trading: 100 shares of Qing Feng Textile Factory were traded at a price of 360 yuan per share.

Shanghai Tug & Lighter Co. will pay 3.5% annual interest on preference shares and 20 yuan per share in national currency on ordinary shares. Mow Tai Co. will pay a dividend of 5 yuan per share in national currency.

### Sugar Price Fluctuations Remain Large

Yesterday's sugar market was affected by the extreme shortage of foreign exchange and Hong Kong [missing character] positions. The trend continued upwards, with the forward price rising sharply by 25 yuan. Spot prices also rose by 25-6 yuan to 20 yuan. In the afternoon, as sellers gradually released their holdings, prices softened. However, they were still up 14-5 yuan to 22 yuan compared to the previous day, with varying degrees of increase. Dutch red sugar initially rose by 23 yuan, then fell back by 18 yuan, still up 5 yuan. Hong Kong raw sugar rose by 20 yuan to 15 yuan. Taikoo white sugar rose by 5 yuan to 10 yuan. For Company Futures, 14 raw and white sugar for the 20th opened at 340 yuan, then went to 325 yuan, then 30.5 yuan.

Sugar also arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Ming Sheng vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying 600 bags of sugar in addition to a large quantity of foreign rice from Hong Kong.

### Evidence of Market Manipulation; Charcoal and White Coal Prices Skyrocket

Yesterday, although the listed prices for charcoal and white coal remained unchanged across various businesses, the unofficial market prices suddenly surged due to hoarding and extensive buying up of old warehouse receipts by speculators. Prices in the market soared by over 100 yuan. Hongji white coal rose from 780 yuan to 920 yuan, No. 1 small coal was 900 yuan, and Haifeng white coal was 920 yuan. Indian anthracite coal exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark, all setting new records. There is clear evidence of market speculation and manipulation. If businesses continue to hoard without selling, retail stores on this street will face supply shortages.

### Diverse Types of Imported and Exported Coarse Grains and Oilseed Cakes

Imports were quite active yesterday. Items transported from Tianjin included 1,950 bags of soybeans, 550 bags of raw kernels, 158 pieces of tobacco shreds, 148 bags of walnuts, 220 pieces of dates, and 1,365 bags of chestnuts.

In addition, 420 boxes of tea were transported to Hong Kong, and 120 boxes to Siam. Also, 72 packages of silk floss were transported to Hong Kong, and 12 packages to Siam.

### Chestnuts (Continued)

— Gao Jiannong

Regarding the Biography of Xiao Han Jianu in the History of Liao, "Xiao Han Jianu managed the chestnut gardens in Nanjing (present-day Beijing). In the fourth year of Chongxi... Emperor Liao Xingzong asked him casually, 'Are there any interesting stories from your hometown?' He replied, 'I only know about stir-frying chestnuts; if the small ones are cooked, the large ones must be raw, and if the large ones are cooked, the small ones must be burnt. Only when they are all cooked evenly, regardless of size, is it perfect!' The Emperor laughed heartily." This vividly describes the situation of stir-frying chestnuts of different sizes in a pot! Not only that, but even what we now commonly call "sugar-roasted chestnuts" has been clearly recorded! According to Zhou [missing character] of Jiaxing, a person from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, in his Record of Xijin: "The Liao Dynasty established the Chestnut Garden Office in Nanjing... Yuan Changping County also had chestnut gardens... Nowadays, in the markets of Yanjing (Beijing), in autumn, they stir-fry [chestnuts] with maltose mixed with small stones. The chestnuts are smaller than those in the south, but the taste is quite sweet, and they are called 'Imperial Chestnuts,' precisely because they are not valued for their large size." Li Shizhen of the late Ming Dynasty summarized the ways of eating chestnuts in his Compendium of Materia Medica: "...Chestnuts... treat kidney deficiency and weak waist and legs. Fill a bag with raw chestnuts and hang it in a dry place, and eat more than ten of them every morning... Chestnuts dried in the wind are better than those sun-dried, and chestnuts roasted in fire or stir-fried in oil are better than steamed or boiled!... (End)"

### US Marine Corps in Shanghai Ordered to Prepare for Evacuation; Merchant Corps A Company to be Deployed Tomorrow Night; Washington's Order Has Significant Implications; US Troops' 15 Years in Shanghai Have Been Instrumental in Maintaining Stability

The commander of the US Marine Corps in China has reportedly received a telegram from Washington ordering the immediate evacuation of the Marine Corps stationed in China. It is reported that the total number of US troops stationed in China is 970, including 750 in Shanghai, 165 in Tianjin, and 55 in Beiping. The troops stationed in Shanghai are the Fourth Regiment under Major General Myers.

The World Situation is Becoming Increasingly Clear

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek made a statement in Chongqing the day before yesterday, expressing that democratic countries and China will surely win the final victory. News has also been reported that US President Roosevelt has ordered the withdrawal of the US Marine Corps stationed in China. At a time when the Japanese side is publicly advocating for the seizure of the Yunnan-Burma Road, this move echoes the situation and symbolically represents the trend of the Far East and the world situation. Yesterday, the US Consulate General in Shanghai, the headquarters of the US Fourth Regiment, and the US Yangtze River Fleet Command remained tight-lipped about Washington's withdrawal of troops from China. However, according to official sources, Roosevelt's announcement of considering the withdrawal of US ground troops from China has the significance of preparing for war and taking a firm stance in the reopened US-Japan talks. In reality, the 750 US troops stationed in Shanghai are essential to maintaining "law and order" under the current circumstances, especially in the Shanghai concession.

International Merchant Corps to Prepare for Deployment

Since the British garrison withdrew last half-year, the defense zone has been temporarily taken over by the International Merchant Corps. The mission of the US Myers team has therefore become more important. The entire Shanghai community believes that the US Myers team has made its best efforts within the defense zone, and that the good situation in this city is entirely dependent on them. If they were to leave suddenly, people's hearts would inevitably be unsettled, and for the sake of the US's own rights, it would be better to postpone the withdrawal unless absolutely necessary. According to reliable sources, the International Merchant Corps A Company has been ordered to be deployed at 5 PM tomorrow. The other companies have also been ordered to be prepared to deploy at any time within half an hour. It is unknown whether this matter is related to the news of the US Myers' withdrawal.

Foreign Residents in Shanghai Express Opinions

Mr. Aler Many, an American lawyer and American director of the Municipal Council, recently made a statement saying that the US Fourth Marine Regiment has had a stabilizing effect on the situation in Shanghai, especially during this period. Sir Marshall, a major British businessman in Shanghai and chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, also stated, "We certainly hope that the US Marine Corps will stay in Shanghai, but if the US government feels that US troops must withdraw, then in light of the current world situation, this move is indeed reasonable." The Japanese side did not issue any official criticism regarding the possible withdrawal of the US Marine Corps from Shanghai. However, the personal opinions of the Japanese are that the move to recall US troops could be interpreted as a significant political gesture by Washington, and they believe that this move is unrelated to any "threat" in the Far East, but rather a sign of the US's possible actions in the Pacific. According to a certain securities broker, the Stock Exchange will be closed this morning, and the market is expected to feel the repercussions when it opens on Monday. However, the planned withdrawal of US troops has long been anticipated and should not cause surprise.

Stationed in Shanghai for 15 Years

The US Fourth Marine Regiment arrived here on the US transport ship Cape Mont on February 24, 1927, and has been stationed in Shanghai ever since. Since the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Shanghai last year, the city has experienced numerous disturbances, and US troops have participated in maintaining law and order together with the defense forces of other countries, taking on a greater share of responsibility in maintaining the security of the Public Concession.

Tomorrow is the Anniversary of Establishment

The US Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai is scheduled to celebrate the 166th anniversary of the establishment of the US Marine Corps tomorrow. Track and field competitions will be held at the US School playground at 9 AM, and commemorative medals will be awarded at 11 AM. The entire program consists of 20 segments, beginning with raising the flag and ending with playing the national anthem and regimental song. Mr. Lockehead, the US Consul (replaced by Stanton due to illness), Major General Glassford, commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet, Mr. Hicks, president of the American Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Lowden, the US Judge, and Mr. Frankling, president of the Columbia Club, are all officials of the conference. The official banquet will be held by the regiment at the American Club from 6 PM to 8 PM tomorrow, presided over by Colonel Howard, the commander, with a "birthday cake" for guests. At the same time, Major General Glassford, commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet, and Consul Lockehead (replaced by Stanton) will deliver speeches. From 6:45 PM to 7 PM, the Great American Evening News and the US-China Broadcasting Station will have commemorative programs.

### Municipal Council to Hold Special Meeting This Afternoon; Price Control Plan May be Revealed Tomorrow; Eagerly Awaiting Announcement of Foreign Exchange Quota

The Municipal Council announced yesterday that it will hold a special meeting at 11 AM today to make decisions on the implementation of the price control issue. Due to the absence of Chairman Liddell, who is on official business in Hong Kong, the special meeting will be chaired by Deputy Chairman Okamoto. All other directors of various nationalities, except for Mr. Mains, will participate. Mr. Philip, the Director-General and CEO, will also attend. It is understood that although today is a holiday, the Municipal Council will reveal the main points of the price control plan. Therefore, Director-General Philip is scheduled to meet with Chinese and foreign reporters at 3 PM this afternoon to announce the resolutions.

Wheat Flour Foreign Exchange Quota Not Yet Agreed Upon

The Price Stabilization Fund has increased the foreign exchange quota allocated to Shanghai for importing rice to a minimum of approximately US$2 million per month, and has continued to allocate approximately US$1 million for importing coal to Shanghai. It is also reported that the Price Stabilization Fund has agreed in principle to allocate foreign exchange for Shanghai to import wheat, flour, and American films, but the amount is still under negotiation. The news that foreign exchange has been agreed upon for the above-mentioned goods is believed to be the result of the trip to Hong Kong by Municipal Council Chairman Liddell and US Director Mains. The foreign exchange allocated by the Price Stabilization Fund for rice and grain will likely be handed over to the Municipal Council. This amount of foreign exchange will be sufficient to transport 250,000 bags of rice here each month.

Hoping for the Distribution of Total Monthly Supply

The foreign exchange supplied by the Price Stabilization Fund will be recorded by the Shanghai Wheat Import Merchants Association. It is reported that the association is scheduled to hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss suppressing wheat prices. According to an important exporter who spoke to reporters, it is hoped that the Price Stabilization Fund can announce the monthly supply amount of foreign exchange for each imported item. If the association can announce this figure in advance, import merchants in Shanghai will be able to manage all retail prices in the short term.

Hoping that Citizens Have Confidence

At the 10th General Meeting of the British Residents Association held at the Racecourse the day before yesterday, the chairman of the association, Mr. Coura, made a speech stating that Shanghai does not lack any supply of materials, but only that the general public lacks confidence. In fact, there is a sufficient supply of daily necessities in the city, so there is no reason to be afraid. Mr. Coura also mentioned the foreign exchange issue, saying that there is sufficient reason to believe that adequate legal foreign exchange will be obtained in the future to supply Shanghai. Mr. Coura also reported on matters jointly studied and carried out by the association and the Municipal Council, such as the closure of gambling dens in western Shanghai and the Seymour Road vegetable market, school fees, gas fees, and price control. Mr. Coura advised the general consumer to assist the Municipal Council in managing prices in the city as much as possible, but believed that passive assistance was not enough. He urged consumers not only to refuse to buy items sold at prices exceeding the regulations, but also to persuade others not to buy them, and at the same time report the locations and store numbers of those selling at prices exceeding the regulations to the authorities for investigation. Mr. Coura concluded by saying that British residents in Shanghai not only represent the outpost of the British Empire, but also represent the British people beyond the outpost, and that what can influence the Chinese people's understanding of Britain is not the actions of the British people, but the actions of British residents in China. It was also learned that as a result of the association's election yesterday, Coura, Woodhead, and 14 others were elected as directors.

### President Lines Trying Their Best to Arrange; Plans to Send Two Ships to Shanghai; Accurate News Expected by the End of This Month

Regarding rumors that the ships of the American President Lines will resume sailing to Shanghai, a certain member of the company recently replied to a customer's inquiry, saying that there is no definite news yet. However, he has received information that the company is currently making every effort to arrange for two ships to sail to Shanghai. These two ships may arrive in Shanghai within the third week of this month. As soon as news is received, the approximate sailing schedules of the two ships will be published in the company's advertisements. Passengers and shipping companies who wish to board these two ships can pay attention to this announcement.

### National Salvation Bonds: Urging Collection of Principal and Interest

Telegram from the Ministry of Finance to all embassies and consulates abroad, all receiving banks, all branches, and all organizations: It has been verified that the first redemption of the National Salvation Bonds was carried out by lottery in August of this year. The winning numbers are 312, 474, 691, and 935. All bond certificates with the same last three digits as the above numbers are the first winning bond certificates. These winning bond certificates and the fourth matured interest coupons began to be paid from August 31st of this year. The overseas portion should be collected by overseas Chinese through local receiving banks, who should collect the principal and interest from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Hong Kong. The period for collection is three years from the date of payment. Any unclaimed amount will be forfeited. This Ministry has issued a public notice and published notices in overseas newspapers for notification. Due to the fact that overseas Chinese have purchased National Salvation Bonds all over the world and the regions are vast, there may be cases where the principal and interest have not been collected overdue due to lack of information. In order to safeguard the rights and interests of overseas Chinese, this Ministry has approved that if overseas bondholders hold National Salvation Bond certificates and their interest coupons, if they are overdue, they can still submit an application to the receiving banks in various places or directly to this Ministry for flexible payment.

However, the Municipal Council has not confirmed or denied this matter.

It is now the Beginning of Winter, and Severe Cold is Approaching; Relief Work Becomes Increasingly Urgent; Prices Soar, Relief Supplies Have Increased Eightfold; the Citizens' Group of the Relief Association Sends Letters Seeking Donations

Yesterday marked the Beginning of Winter, and severe cold is swiftly approaching. The Citizens' Group of the Relief Association, facing a sharp increase in relief supplies needed, is appealing to all sectors to continue making donations. The Three Teachings Morality Society, in charge of providing meals, has designated twenty locations for meal distribution and has appointed Wen Lanting as the honorary chairman. Youth associations and others are actively soliciting donations of winter clothing for the poor due to the cold weather. The details are as follows:

More Than Ten Thousand Refugees Still Sheltered

Since the increase in prices, citizens' living expenses have risen, leading to a sharp decrease in donations for disaster relief. Even the refugee donations collected from dance halls, restaurants, and hotels have declined month by month. The Citizens' Group of the Relief Association yesterday sent letters to all sectors, appealing for continued donations. The original text reads: "Since the launch of our association's fundraising campaign for disaster relief, we have been deeply grateful for the enthusiastic support from all sectors. Currently, due to rising prices, aside from the young and strong who have been sent away, there are still over ten thousand women, children, elderly, and disabled refugees being sheltered. The issue of providing them with supplies is extremely serious. When the incident occurred, the monthly cost of relief supplies per refugee was only two yuan. Now, it requires about sixteen yuan per person per month, an eightfold increase, which is still insufficient to keep them warm and fed. Their situation is even more difficult than before. We have always admired your kindness, compassion, and willingness to help others. Therefore, we dare to once again appeal to you, respectfully requesting that you consider the suffering of the disaster victims and continue to donate, so that relief work can be carried out thoroughly. We eagerly await your response."

Designated Locations for Meal Distribution

The impoverished relief work of providing porridge and rice by the Three Teachings Morality Council has not been interrupted. Last month, they also resumed their work of providing relief to orphans and widows. Once investigated and approved, they provide monthly living subsidies, which has been praised by all sectors. At the same time, due to the high prices, the lives of poor citizens have become precarious. Refugees on the streets are particularly miserable, suffering from hunger and cold as the biting winter wind approaches. Therefore, the meal distribution work has been widely promoted. Each voucher is good for one bowl of white rice. Twenty meal distribution locations have been designated so that the poor can redeem the vouchers nearby. They are located at: 25 Xinzha Road, 654 Chengdu Road, 345 Julu Road, 91 Zhejiang Road, 6 Yunnan Road, 36 Maigen Road, 420 Dapu Bridge Road, 222 Route Lafayette, 14 Jiaozhou Road, 493 Avenue Albert, 1542 Rue Robert, 4521 Route Cardinal Mercier, 407 Route Tenant de la Tour, 921 Dongyouheng Road, 166 North Shanxi Road, 447 Yuchiaching Road at the intersection of Route Picard, 52 Balizhuang Road, 307 Avenue Albert, 63 Luxiangyuan Road, 217 Wuzhou Road.

Enthusiastic Solicitation of Winter Clothing for the Poor

In addition to the above relief work, the Three Teachings Society is also engaged in winter clothing work. In addition to accepting donations for distribution from all sectors, they also issue clothing vouchers, one set per voucher, sold for thirteen yuan, so that benevolent people can purchase and distribute them themselves. Recently, due to the soaring prices of cotton and cotton cloth, many unscrupulous merchants have attempted to purchase and hoard them. After the society discovered this, they refused to sell in bulk and added a stamp on the clothes for identification. They also requested all charitable organizations in the city to pay attention to prevention. Furthermore, the Christian Youth Association launched a campaign to solicit 30,000 yuan for winter clothing for the poor in Shanghai. Since the launch of the campaign, donations of cash and used clothing have been very enthusiastic. The association believes that as the weather gets colder, the poor should be spared from freezing and sickness. Therefore, they have decided to disinfect the used clothing this month and then distribute it to different districts. At the same time, considering the large number of poor people, they are appealing to all sectors to enthusiastically donate to complete the work.

### Puyi Arts and Crafts Society Solicits Winter Clothing

Missing 20,000 Yuan from Fundraising Target

The Puyi Arts and Crafts Society, in view of the approaching severe winter and the imminent threat of cold, believes that the original cotton clothes of the general elderly, weak, women, children, and impoverished disaster victims are old and torn, and not enough to keep them warm. If no active measures are taken, they will likely suffer from cold and hunger. Therefore, they are sincerely appealing, hoping that all sectors will maintain their past enthusiasm for disaster relief and provide assistance, either by donating cash or winter clothing, so that these people can have something to keep warm and survive the difficult times. Since the society launched the "50,000 Yuan" fundraising campaign last month, this newspaper has introduced it several times and appealed on its behalf, which has been met with enthusiastic support from all sectors, either by donating cash or clothing, so that the society's daily relief of over one thousand elderly, weak, sick, and impoverished disaster victims can have work and be free from worries about food and clothing. However, there is still a shortfall of more than 20,000 yuan from the target. It is hoped that all sectors will continue to donate. The donations received last week are listed below: Xie Weiqing raised 1,700 yuan, Taikoo Yang Weibin 200 yuan, Wang Yushu raised 1,000 yuan, Cao Maode 100 yuan, Li Chenshi's birthday gift 150 yuan, Xu Anqing raised 110 yuan, Qin Junji 500 yuan, Qingxin Girls' School continued to raise 5,811.55 yuan, Luo Jiabin raised 1,000 yuan, Shen Baochang raised 350 yuan, Chen Mao Yafeng 1,100 yuan, Dr. Yang Suzhen raised 1,100 yuan, Rongfeng Yarn Factory 100 yuan, Anonymous (handled by Wei Jun) 100 yuan, Xie Siliang raised 500 yuan, Juemin Primary School 500 yuan, Sun Linshu raised 327 yuan, Qian Xianchang 150 yuan, Teng Keqin raised 1,000 yuan, Ms. Chen Huizhen raised 1,005 yuan, He Dekui and 27 others a total of 574.04 yuan, 11 Westerners donated a total of 990 yuan, American company American Micro donated a large package of matches (worth 1,700 yuan), Jiuji (handled by Bian Fengzhu) donated 5 bolts of white cloth (worth 500 yuan). The society's office is located at 2nd floor, 25 Hankou Road (telephone 16082).

### Pudong Native Place Association Holds Autumn Festival Commemoration of Local Worthies

Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Pudong Native Place Association on Route Edward held an autumn festival to commemorate local worthies. The ceremony was solemn and grand. Fellow natives and family members of the worthies gathered on the sixth floor to perform the rituals as required and delivered a memorial address, saying, "It is said that honoring merit and respecting virtue are guided by constant principles. Spring sacrifices and autumn feasts are long-standing precedents. This has always been the same in the past and present and is also a grand event in our native place. Thinking of our native place sages, who were blessed by the rivers and seas, and whose talents emerged from our hometown, we remember their exemplary conduct and add to the glory of our hometown. Some were upright officials and Confucian scholars, while others were skilled craftsmen and wealthy merchants. They extended themselves to others, united the community, sought public welfare, honored their ancestors, and passed on blessings to future generations. Only by accumulating good deeds can one bring down blessings. We model ourselves on gold and embroider with silk, respectfully observing their portraits. We enshrine them in our native place and sacrifice to them in our community, sharing bright sacrifices together. We respectfully offer pepper and fragrance, humbly hoping that they will accept our offerings. November 8th, 30th year of the Republic of China." After the ceremony, Mr. Zhang Bochun gave a speech on the meaning of the autumn festival, and Mr. Zhu Shaoqi reported on the association's affairs. Both expressed their hope that fellow natives would pay attention to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, maintain the inherent virtues of their native place, and abandon the extravagant habits of Shanghai. It is said that the association's affairs have been progressing smoothly in recent years.

Extension of the Fujian-Guangdong Telegram Communication Area

Since Fuzhou Lei Bao was recovered by the Chinese army, it has been sending and receiving telegrams as usual, and telegram registration has also been restored, providing a lot of convenience for telegram senders.

### Butcher Kills with Knife; Defendant Tried Yesterday at Court; Housewife Dies, Three Others Injured

Chen Yin-nan, a Hebei native who used to be a section chief under Chen Tiaoyuan, moved to Shanghai with his family after the outbreak of the war and resided at No. 43, Lane 930, Fuxu Road, Cihui Nanli. He hired Wang Huan-zhang (52 years old), a fellow native, as a butcher. At 5:10 PM on the 7th of this month, Chen asked Wang to wash a pair of shorts. Wang then went to the drying platform and took a large bundle of firewood downstairs. At that time,

Chen's wife, Madam Shen,

criticized Wang for taking too much firewood. Wang refused to accept the criticism and argued back, which resulted in Madam Shen stopping him. Unexpectedly, Wang harbored resentment in his heart and rushed to the kitchen, grabbed a kitchen knife, and, without asking why, slashed Madam Shen's head, face, body, hands, and other parts. Her second daughter, Yun-fen, stepped forward to help her mother and was also slashed in the head. At the time, Chen Yin-nan and his eldest daughter, Yun-heng, heard the alarm and stepped forward to dissuade Wang, but Wang was like a madman

and slashed at anyone he encountered.

Chen's forehead, chest, wrist, and Yun-heng's head were all injured. None of the four family members were spared. His methods can be described as extremely vicious. Afterwards, Chinese constables No. 3148 and detective Wang Zhichao arrived, took the murderer and the kitchen knife into custody, and sent the four injured to the Red Cross Hospital. However, Madam Chen Shen's injuries were fatal, and she died shortly after. Her body was sent to the coroner's office. The other three were all

hospitalized for treatment.

Yesterday morning, Wang Huan-zhang was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The constable's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, filed a lawsuit according to law. Chen Yun-fen's injuries were relatively minor, and she also filed a case, stating the circumstances of the incident. Wang Huan-zhang stated that he was a distant relative of Chen and that he worked for Chen for a monthly salary of only five yuan. He had repeatedly requested to resign and return to his hometown, but Chen refused to give him travel expenses, which led to this tragedy. Judge Zhong postponed the hearing for further investigation.

### Significant Developments in the Xu Songyao Murder Case Yesterday; Coroner's Report Not Yet Released; Two Sisters Detained

Regarding the shocking case of fratricide that has caused a sensation in society, after the coffin was opened for inspection yesterday in a small ward on Route Tenant de la Tour, there seems to be a major development in the case.

Two detectives from the French police station handling the case were also detained for investigation. The details are as follows:

Knife Wounds Confirmed

The day before yesterday, after Xu Songyao's body was inspected, reliable sources revealed that he was indeed slashed by a sharp weapon. There were five wounds on his head and one on his chest, which were one or two inches deep and were caused by a square-headed sharp weapon. The body of Zheng Xiangda, the carter whose cause of death was unknown, was also examined by a forensic doctor yesterday. There were no signs of poisoning on the surface. It will only be clear after examining the internal organs.

Investigation of Detectives

### Separate Pricing of Soybean Oil is Set; Mixing with Other Oils is Prohibited

Since the French authorities set price limits on the retail price of soy sauce and alcohol shops in the city on August 11, the industry association has repeatedly reported to its members that the cost of goods has been rising. After several runs, the French Municipal Council's Price Stabilization Committee approved the temporary sale of these items at 2.96 yuan from November 6, starting on November 5. The association issued a notice that this selling price, though it still does not match the cost, is aimed to show consideration for the commoners, so members should not raise prices without authorization. The association yesterday also received a letter from the French Municipal Council's Price Stabilization Committee prohibiting the mixing of other oils. According to investigations, one catty equals 500 grams.

### Washington Watch Store Robbed, Significant Losses; Over 200,000 Yuan

At around 7:10 PM last night, the Washington Watch and Optical Store at 44 Jing'an Temple Road was robbed. Just after the store had closed, three robbers suddenly broke in through the back door. Two of them were wearing long gowns, and one was wearing a suit. At the time, only one employee was sweeping the store. The robbers rushed inside, took out firearms, and forbade him from making any noise. One robber ran upstairs and forced all the staff and apprentices upstairs to hand over the keys to the display case. Then, one person was imprisoned in a room, and one robber stood guard with a gun at the door. The remaining two robbers went downstairs, opened the display cases and small storage boxes (which contained many gold watches and pocket watches worth over a thousand yuan each), and looted for about half an hour before leaving. Afterwards, the store estimated that the loss of precious watches was about six or seven hundred, estimated to be worth over 200,000 yuan. After the robbers left, they reported to the Xinwen Police Station, which ordered Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and track down the robbers.

### YMCA William Hall Opens Tomorrow; Commemorating William Locke

In order to commemorate the late American staff member William Locke, the Shanghai YMCA recently had friends of Locke jointly raise funds to build a William Locke Prayer Hall on the second floor of the YMCA at the Eight Immortals Bridge, dedicated to group or private religious worship. Locke came to China from the United States in 1903 and immediately became a staff member of the YMCA. Locke firmly believed in Christ and devoted his life to religious work, especially in the training of talents, the current reorganization, and the promotion of the development of the National YMCA Association. He contributed greatly. There are about 40 YMCAs established in various parts of China, and Locke had a hand in them. He loved to write throughout his life and often used Chinese issues to promote in American newspapers and magazines. He was very sympathetic to the difficulties faced by our country and nation and deeply hoped that our government and people would become stronger. His wish was to dedicate his life to China. In the winter of 1936, he died in Shanghai due to overwork and illness, having served the Shanghai YMCA for 33 years. Diligent and dedicated, he was like one day for decades. In order to leave a permanent memory, the YMCA built this public prayer hall. The entire project was designed by architect Li Jinpei and constructed by Jiang Yuji. It took years to complete. Although its scale is not very large, every detail has been carefully planned and meticulously managed, making it a model public prayer hall in the Far East. The YMCA has scheduled to hold a dedication ceremony with religious rites at 5:00 PM tomorrow (the 10th). At the same time, a memorial service will be held, and religious figures will be invited to participate. The ceremony will be grand, and there is sure to be a grand occasion.

### Labor Strike at Zhejiang, Lafayette, and Other Cinemas; Screenings Suspended

Cinema workers in this city once launched a labor strike in mid-August of this year due to low wages and demands for improved treatment. However, it was only a one-hour work stoppage. After negotiations between the employer and the workers, the problem was resolved. However, the four cinemas operated by Jewish merchants: Zhejiang, Lafayette, Amon, and Dumei, had not reached a formal solution, so the matter has been delayed until now. Recently, the workers of the above four cinemas requested a general subsidy increase of ten yuan from the employer, starting this month, because prices were rising daily and it was difficult to maintain a living. Because the employer did not respond, the projectionists of the four cinemas went on strike yesterday afternoon and were late to the cinemas. As a result, the 2:30 PM screenings at each cinema could not be opened. Except for Amon, which had already increased the subsidy by twenty yuan, and did not close, the other three cinemas refunded tickets and suspended business, and posted "Temporarily Closed" signs at the gate. It is reported that the labor-management negotiations were still ongoing last night, and the cinemas may be able to resolve the issue and reopen today.

Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong of the First Special District Court presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Wang Youlin was found guilty of monopolizing designated goods and sentenced to eight months of imprisonment and fined 400 yuan. The four bags of Hong Kong rice that were seized were ordered to be handed over to a trusted rice shop by the police station to be sold as low-priced rice. The proceeds from the rice sale were to be handed over to the court for storage.

### Dismissed Apprentice Steals; Father and Son Sentenced to Imprisonment

### How to Commemorate the Founding Father's Birthday

— Yang Chunlu

In two days—November 12th, it will be our Founding Father's birthday, so all schools will have a day off and hold a grand ceremony.

The Founding Father initiated the revolution and led many revolutionary heroes. After forty years of difficult and arduous struggle, the Republic of China was established. Therefore, his birthday can be said to be the birthday of the country. The history of his life is also the history of the birth of the country.

Now, when we commemorate the Founding Father's birthday, we should learn his revolutionary spirit: He devoted himself to the revolution, unafraid of difficulties and dangers, for forty years as one day. He failed ten times, but he was not discouraged at all. He continued to struggle constantly. Finally, the autocratic Qing Dynasty was overthrown, and the Republic of China was established. His spirit of perseverance and his courage to never give up are worthy of our admiration and imitation.

When we commemorate the Founding Father's birthday, we must also learn his spirit of patriotism. For the freedom and equality of the motherland, he appealed and worked tirelessly, exhausting his efforts until the last minute of his death, and still shouting loudly, "Peace! Struggle! Save China!" This spirit of loving the country is what we must follow. Especially in this time of such serious national crisis, how should children learn his spirit and struggle to build the country?

When we commemorate the Founding Father's birthday, we must also learn his studious spirit: He loved to read books the most. When supervising the battle on the front lines, he still carried books with him. Therefore, he was able to write many books, such as the Three Principles of the People, the Strategy of National Reconstruction, and the Outline of National Reconstruction, to instruct us on how to save and build the country. He often said to people: "In my life, besides revolution, reading is my only hobby. If I don't read for a day, I cannot live." Now that we are children who are studying, how should we encourage ourselves and emulate our Founding Father?

### How to Be Filial

— Ying Dai

In today's declining moral climate, filial piety is indeed a topic worthy of discussion. Generally, sons don't even consider filial piety, let alone take their parents seriously. It's not uncommon to see people beating their parents; a few harsh words are a minor matter.

Recently, the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, to promote filial piety, held a filial piety week and solicited essays from students of various schools. The given topics were "How to Be Filial?" and "My Parents." I originally considered having the students in my class participate, but due to time constraints, I abandoned the idea.

However, afterward, I still gave them the above two topics in composition class. Of the thirty-odd students, more than two-thirds chose the "How to Be Filial?" topic. After grading the papers, I found that their opinions could be summarized as follows:

Listen to your parents and don't go against them, causing them unhappiness.

Study hard and achieve good grades, which will make your parents happy.

If your parents have things they are not satisfied with, you should persuade and comfort them.

During these extraordinary times, all expenses should be saved; be aware of the difficulty your parents have in earning money.

When your parents are sick, personally brew medicine for them and visit them often.

Well, during the student years, one only spends money and doesn't earn it, so there's no talk of supporting parents. But being able to do the above few points can also be considered filial piety, right?

### The Greatest Beauty

— Niu Huiren

"What is the most beautiful?" I think, if I were to ask this question, children would have many answers. Red and yellow chrysanthemums are the most beautiful, or maple leaves redder than February flowers are the most beautiful, or colorful tropical fish are the most beautiful... Right? Which one is the most correct? Wrong, I think they are all only partially correct. Then, the children must ask in surprise: "What is the most beautiful?"

Listen, there are two kinds of beauty, one is the beauty of form and color, and the other is the beauty of spirit. The common beauty, the beauty of flowers, moon, insects, and birds, is the beauty of form. That is superficial beauty, temporary beauty, which is very small. Strictly speaking, it cannot really be considered beauty. True beauty is the beauty of spirit—love. The French maiden Joan of Arc loved her country and sacrificed herself to lead the people in resisting the enemy, finally saving the country from danger. Her love, how great and beautiful it is! Florence Nightingale loved humanity, braving the dangers of bullets and gunfire to care for the wounded soldiers on the battlefield, establishing the nursing system, so that wounded soldiers and patients all over the world have since been comforted. Her love, how great and beautiful it is!

Remember, the most beautiful thing in the world is "love." Love is the purest beauty, the most permanent beauty. Each of you has a love in your heart. May you love your parents, love your society, love your country, love all of humanity, and establish your greatest beauty!

### The Spider and the Butterfly

— Ye Fei

A spider was spinning a web on a tree, but because the wind was too strong, it couldn't spin it well after a long time. But it wasn't discouraged at all, only focusing on spinning the web wholeheartedly.

Its friend, the butterfly, flew over and said to it: "Brother Spider, you are too foolish. The wind is so strong that no matter how capable you are, you won't be able to spin it well. Why not come and play with me!"

But the spider was determined to not play until it was done well. It replied to the butterfly: "Sister Butterfly, spinning the web is my responsibility. I must spin it well. Although the wind is strong, I am not afraid. I have the strength to struggle. What's the point of living a life like yours, dressed in fancy clothes, wandering around all day, playing here and there?" After speaking, it continued to spin its web...very resolutely, so the butterfly flew away in disappointment.

The wind gradually subsided, and the spider finished spinning its web, leisurely sitting in the middle of the web.

The butterfly came again, and it saw the spider and said in surprise: "Brother Spider, you are really capable, you actually succeeded in spinning it."

The spider replied calmly: "Sister Butterfly, you are young and don't know, let me tell you: This is not because of my ability, but because I have patience. As long as one is willing to be patient, don't be discouraged by the initial setbacks. If you fail the first time, there is a second time; if you fail the second time, there is a third time... If you keep doing it with perseverance, you will succeed eventually. So patience is the foundation of success!"

The butterfly was very moved by what the spider said and flew away to do things.

Therefore, dear children, you must always be patient when doing things. The spider mentioned above is a good model for you to follow:

### The First Monthly Exam

— Hu Depei

The busy monthly exam has come to an end all at once today. The results are not yet known in detail.

I remember that before the exam, my mind was always preoccupied with the monthly exam, so my face always wore a look of fear, as if a great disaster was about to befall me. I spent all my time on books, preparing for the exam.

During the exam, the teachers were very serious and set many difficult questions, making us rack our brains and bury ourselves in doing them. The time was set to only forty minutes each time. After the time was up, we were no longer allowed to delay for a moment. And the seats of each person were all swapped to prevent cheating. The teachers are truly meticulous in order to improve our academic level.

Now the exam is over, and the panic of many days has disappeared like smoke. How happy! However, in the blink of an eye, the second monthly exam will follow closely. How should we work hard!

### Clothing (Part 2)

— Lin Ren

When metabolism occurs, a lot of heat is generated, so we are always warm. If we wear too few clothes, the heat is transmitted to the body and dissipated to the surrounding air, and you will feel even colder. So when the weather gets cold, wear more clothes. These clothes are like a layer of wall, blocking the heat emitted from your body and preventing it from dissipating, and keeping it all around your body, so you feel much warmer. Among clothes, wool is the warmest, because wool sweaters are very loose. When worn, they have many empty spaces to store the heat emitted from the body. That's why we wear cotton robes in winter, right! Have you ever seen your mother often sun-drying winter clothes and beating them with a rattan beater in the sun? What's the reason for this? …

"I know that, because clothes often have moths hiding in them that damage the clothes. Sunning them can kill them, and beating them with a rattan beater is to scare out the moths hiding in the inner layer of the clothes, so they can be killed one by one, and the clothes will no longer be damaged by moths," said A Liang搶着.

"That's not wrong, but there's another reason. Beating can not only remove the dust from the clothes, but also make the inner layer of the clothes very loose, because they have always been pressed in the box, pressed very tightly. When worn in winter, they don't feel very warm. After being beaten, the inner layer of the clothes can be loosened, and there can be many gaps inside to store the body's heat. That's the same reason!"

After A Liang's father finished saying these many words, he was about to go out with his mother to buy some winter clothing materials. A Liang clamored to go too. Anyway, today is Sunday, so take him with them. So they took a tram to the bustling center. In less than half an hour, they stepped into a cloth shop with three storefronts.

"This year's clothing materials are really unbelievably expensive. This piece of fake wool also costs tens of dollars." As they only bought one piece of clothing material and walked out, his father muttered like this. He originally wanted to buy a few more pieces, but he didn't know that the money he brought out was barely enough to buy one good piece of clothing material, so he chose a piece of clothing material with a similar price and that was it. A Liang's idea of making new clothes also became a bubble. They stepped back on the tram and returned home.

### Handling the Arhats in "Thinking of the Mundane"

— Hua Yu

The "Thinking of the Mundane" from the Kunqu opera *Niehai Ji* is a solo performance. Although it is performed by one person on stage, it has a clear and elegant charm, is substantial without being vulgar, and the tone is soft and beautiful, and the rhythm is round, vigorous, light, and agile. The performance of this nun who is detached from the mundane world has intricate and subtle movements, beautiful postures, and many key points and mysteries, showing the wonderfulness of complexity and change. Without sufficient skill, it is difficult to sing and act properly. Therefore, it requires all kinds of grace and proper behavior to be considered a masterpiece.

I have seen "Thinking of the Mundane" performed by Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Zhu Chuanming, Han Shichang, and Xu Lao Taitai, a female amateur performer in Shanghai. The number of times inside and outside the profession must be more than ten, and they all gave me considerable satisfaction. This shows the preciousness of Kunqu opera. Although there are some who simply rush around the stage, pretending to be reserved, waving their sleeves and dusting off, doing whirlwind dances, and whose facial expressions are hurried like a rushing torrent, those are all wild fox Zen and are not to be taken as the standard.

Anyone who plays *Sekong* must have pure skill, skillful posture, and express sensuality moderately. In interpreting the plot, it should be joyous without being unrestrained. The movements of the water sleeves, the control and elevation of the duster, must be in harmony with the rhythm between slowness and speed. The appearance must be proper while the spirit moves, and the eyebrows must want to fly while the expression dances. It is especially necessary to maintain the true, good, and beautiful without being carved out of innate vitality in order to reach a wonderful state.

In the performance of singing the "Shan Po Yang" section "The little nun is only eighteen years old... Let's just focus on the present," all the actions performed at this time must be like spring clouds emerging from the mountains and flowing water circling, with not being bound by appearances as the supreme skill.

The performance of this section must fully express the *Sekong* who lives alone, the deep lock of the Zen gate, the surging of romantic thoughts, the realization that life is empty, and the sudden awakening, which cannot be suppressed, that "Only the living suffer, and never see the dead wearing shackles," and "Doing homework for the underworld for nothing," so she decides to escape, so from the scripture hall to the two corridors, to the mountain gate, her expression, thoughts, and steps are all tense. The steps to escape down the mountain are like a startled swan, flying like a swallow, and have the wonder of Yiliao juggling balls and Gongsun dancing with swords.

In the Arhat Hall, playing with makeup and costumes, with all kinds of appearances, five colors and ten colors, shining with dancing sleeves and singing shirts, the arrangement of the stage is essential. However, after the little nun goes down the mountain, the Arhats still stand in rows. This point should be considered. My idea is, in singing "...That old eyebrow immortal worries about me, saying what will happen to me when I am old... I can't be in a decorated pavilion..." After singing this section, she should make a gesture of walking out of the mountain, and at the same time close the stage curtain. After the stage curtain is closed, it is good to make the Arhats leave the stage, and then *Sekong* continues to sing "I tear my cassock..." Take off the cassock and continue performing down the mountain. As for the little monk going down the mountain, I have seen Hua Chuanhao's performance, and I really can't find a second person. It is said that he learned from Lu Shouqing's style.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— 頋 Mingdao

### Chapter 19: At Dusk, Hu Cavalry Filled the City with Dust

I had to defend against the Qing soldiers on one side, and resist the roaming bandits on the other, turning into a situation where I was attacked from both sides, and I felt very distraught. The other day, I suddenly received an order from General Wu, instructing me to immediately withdraw from Ningyuan and retreat to Shanhaiguan as scheduled. He had already begged the Qing court for assistance to jointly suppress the roaming bandits. So I had no choice but to obey the order and lead my subordinates back to Shanhaiguan to report to General Wu. Because I missed you all, I immediately ran to Jiuchengkou to visit and talk. Who knew that when I arrived at the camp gate, I couldn't find you anywhere. A soldier reported that he had seen you sitting on horses and taking luggage away. I was a little suspicious, wondering if you had left without saying goodbye. Fortunately, you hadn't gone far, so I took two riders and immediately chased after you. I am glad that we can still meet. Alas! Zhang, my dear brother, why did you leave like this?" Zhang Cangqiu sneered and said, "Brother Chai, are you asking us why we left Shanhaiguan? Alas! The four of us came here to join the army from thousands of miles away, originally holding a bit of enthusiasm for General Wu. Unfortunately, General Wu's actions now are not in line with our thinking, so to be honest, we are unwilling to serve under him anymore. Because Brother Chai was far away in Ningyuan, we heard that you were about to withdraw, and we didn't have time to wait. Please forgive us." Chen Fei also said, "This is something that could not be avoided. You, my old brother, understand all the things that General Wu is doing. A clear person doesn't need to go into details." Chai Wu nodded when he heard them say this, and said, "I also guessed that you left because General Wu begged the Qing court for assistance. General Wu's move is of course somewhat akin to seeking skin from a tiger, not understanding the situation. (124)

### Film Subtitles Self-Made by Chinese People

— Xing

The printing of subtitles on domestic films (such as song lyrics, etc.) was originally exclusively handled by a German company. Since Shen Tianyin and others initiated the China Electrical Subtitle Company in March, with excellent results, the subtitle work of China United, Jin Xing, Yi Hua, Guo Hua, Min Hua, and other companies has been completely taken over by the China Electrical Company. From now on, this business in the hands of foreign merchants will be in the hands of the Chinese people.
