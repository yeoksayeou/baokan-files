### Full Cooperation between the US, UK, Netherlands, and India: Negotiations Have Reached a Decision Stage; Australia and New Zealand Discuss the Pacific Situation; Dutch East Indies Navy to Conduct Four-Day Exercises Next Week

Melbourne, 23rd (United Press) - Observers here believed yesterday that negotiations between the British, American governments, and the Dutch East Indies have reached a stage where, in the event of incidents, Pacific nations can establish full cooperation. It is reported that Australian Prime Minister Curtin is maintaining close contact with Washington through Australian Minister Casey. It is said that, apart from the existing close understanding, no definitive joint defense plan has been established in the Pacific. However, negotiations have reached a decisive point to ensure that precautionary steps are taken so that goods can be transported to Australia to cope with the crisis. The Cabinet announced the latest developments last night. Curtin also informed the ministers about the negotiations over the past two weeks. Curtin declined to disclose the details, considering them "not in the public interest." Officials pointed out that Australia would not conclude special agreements with the United States or the Dutch East Indies without discussing them with the United Kingdom. However, the basis of the current steps is to ensure that defense issues are fully discussed.

Melbourne, 23rd (Reuters) - According to an announcement by Australian Prime Minister Curtin after the meeting, the Australian War Advisory Council today discussed in detail the general relationship between Australia and New Zealand regarding the Pacific situation. The supply of goods to the two autonomous territories and Australia's role in the Eastern supply group were also debated.

Melbourne, 23rd (Reuters) - After consulting with the Australian War Cabinet and military leaders, and further reviewing Australia's northern defenses, a meeting was held yesterday. The resolutions will be discussed by the War Trial Council today, and New Zealand Prime Minister Nash will also attend. After the cabinet meeting, Australian Prime Minister Curtin stated that the government would be satisfied only when all unemployed workers are employed and labor is utilized in the best way. The Australian government's plan is to control investment and organize manpower so that available manpower can be mobilized to meet war needs, and to absorb excess income and encourage people to donate voluntarily to carry out the war. Since the beginning of the war, 450,000 people have been incorporated into the military. The total amount of military pay for this year is 150 million pounds more than the pre-war level.

Tokyo, 23rd (United Press) - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that the Dutch East Indies had notified Japan that from October 28th to 31st, all ships would be prohibited from entering the two-mile-wide waterway of Javanese territorial waters facing Batavia due to Dutch naval exercises.

Batavia, 23rd (United Press) - According to investigations today, the Dutch in the East Indies are very indifferent to the establishment of the Tojo cabinet in Japan. Unofficial comments from officials have revealed the seriousness of the situation, but there is no fear for the immediate future. Dutch East Indies leaders do not openly express official opinions on Japan's recent cabinet changes. Dutch newspapers also followed this general intention, warning the Javanese people that there is a possibility of any accident, but did not reflect any particular anxiety. A few days ago, the Dutch may have had different views on Japan's development, but now the residents of the Dutch East Indies have full confidence. They have seen their army develop into a powerful mechanized army, backed by countless American-shipped fighter planes. British, American, and Australian staff officers continue to come to the Dutch East Indies. They often talk about joint offensives, and the US, UK, China, and Netherlands front has repeatedly resolved. The slogan "maintain the status quo but do not offend Japan" seems to have been forgotten, and replaced by serious silence. Well-informed sources say that the only remaining difficulty in the Dutch East Indies defenses is the lack of a truly signed joint defense agreement between democratic countries. A prominent Dutchman told reporters, "If the UK and the US are willing to promise in writing to assist us if we are attacked, the last obstacle to a firm stance against Japan's southward advance can be removed."

### Japan Builds Military Bases on the Vietnamese Border

Bangkok, 23rd (Reuters) - Two Thai newspapers with different political leanings today both carried news of the movement of Japanese troops in Vietnam near the Thai border. Sri Krung Daily reported that Japanese soldiers were dispatched in areas not far from Saigon, Prun, Bon, and other places near the Thai border. A large Japanese army will build a military base in the Prun Bon area. Subabhans Daily reported that Japanese troops have been transferred from Hanoi and southern Vietnam to the Vietnamese side of the Mekong River border. The main highway from Pakse to Saigon is now used by the Japanese army and is only used for military traffic.

Tokyo, 23rd (Reuters) - Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, Kenkichi Yoshizawa, will depart for his post on October 28th. After attending farewell parties in Kobe and Osaka, Yoshizawa will depart on the Osaka Shosen Kaisha ship on the 31st. Eleven other officials have been appointed to assist Yoshizawa.

Tokyo, 23rd (Reuters) - A Yomiuri Shimbun correspondent in Bangkok today again accused the UK and the US of conspiracies in Thailand and Southeast Asia, saying that the US, UK, China, and the Netherlands are now trying various methods to prevent Thailand from cooperating with Japan. The British government is also negotiating with the Dutch authorities to place the Dutch East Indies under the direct jurisdiction of Singapore. It is reported that Duff Cooper will soon return to England to report everything to the British government.

Manila, 23rd (United Press) - Major Leechmon, the British liaison officer of the Governor of Burma, arrived here yesterday en route to Hong Kong on an official mission. Major Snowchmon denied the rumors in the newspapers that Burma is pro-Japanese. He said that it is indeed true that there is a strong national sentiment in Burma, but the sane Burmese people do not want self-government at this time because they have seen what has happened in French Vietnam and must realize what Thailand and Burma will encounter once the United Kingdom no longer protects them.

### Although the Tojo Cabinet is Formed, Japan's Attitude Remains Cautious, Hoping to End the War with China Early

Washington, 23rd (Reuters) - News from Tokyo recently clearly indicates that although the new cabinet has been formed, Japan is still Japan. The Tojo cabinet has been in office for several days, and Japan remains cautious but is prepared to take advantage of any opportunity that arises. Although the Japanese regime is in the hands of the army, there are no truly extreme elements in the cabinet, nor have any special figures inclined towards the Axis powers been recruited. Although a more radical policy is possible, no steps have yet been taken in this direction. The best indication of Japan's true situation seems to be Germany's disappointment that Japan's development has not been beneficial to Berlin's plans. The well-informed Weekly Foreign Communications stated that Tojo did not bring many famous pro-Axis Japanese into the cabinet and continued US-Japan talks, which Germany felt quite apprehensive about.

Waging a Psychological War on the Soviet Union

Washington sources believe that Japan's only concern is to improve its position in the European war. As for whether this goal is achieved by uniting with the Axis countries or the democratic countries, it is not a decisive consideration. There is reason to believe that Japan's policy is to exert limited pressure on the democratic countries to see what the reaction is. Japan will greatly strengthen its position in Vietnam while watching the reaction of the UK and the US. Japan may also take action against Thailand to disturb the UK to find out the extent to which the UK will aid Thailand in resisting Japan. At the same time, Japan will wage a psychological war on the Soviet Union to spread news of the concentration of Japanese troops in Manchuria, while Japanese newspapers will publicize that Japan has traditional rights in Siberia. The Foreign Communications also stated that the Tojo government is now contacting Chongqing with the intention of negotiating peace, because China is apprehensive about the US-Japan talks, so Japan takes the opportunity to do so. However, people here feel that Japan now wants to end the war in China at any cost, but will soon continue to fight China to make up for its peace movement. This is what the Foreign Communications said. It should be known that all those familiar with Far Eastern events feel that China does not need to be apprehensive if it has this anxiety, because they believe that the US-Japan talks are an effort to freeze the existing relationship, not an effort to establish a compromise. The continuation of the talks is nothing more than a delaying tactic before the final break.

The US Decides to Continue Aiding China in the War

We must know that the strength of the United States allows it to have a navy, which is now being strengthened day by day. Furthermore, after the US-Japan talks, the talks will be conducted by Welles, the Assistant Secretary of State, and Sugawara, the Japanese Counselor, while Secretary of State Hull and Japanese Ambassador Nomura will personally negotiate only when there is something definite to discuss. This fact shows the preliminary or exploratory nature of the US-Japan talks. We still have to know that Japan, with its large army trapped in the Chinese quagmire, and with this war against China still consuming Japanese resources, cannot have sufficient strength to fight a first-class country. If the United States can obtain a guarantee that Japan will be exhausted in China, then aid to China will continue to increase. The more China fights Japan, the more aid China can get from the United States. There is definitely no tendency in Washington to sell out China. If the authorities have this policy, it will undoubtedly be opposed by the whole country. The German side is now enticing the Japanese, thinking that American merchant ships can be destroyed, American warships can be attacked, and the United States has never had a real uproar. Why should Tokyo worry about the United States, because the United States can never fight on two fronts, so it may not fight on any front. This statement by the German side is not accurate and will be proven or soon be revealed in the future, which is unknown.

Japanese and German Observations Differ Greatly

London, 22nd (Reuters) - The Washington telegram from Qin Wu Qi Bao stated that, according to reliable sources in Washington, since the establishment of the Tojo cabinet, Germans in Tokyo have repeatedly wanted the Japanese government to issue official statements reaffirming Japan's adherence to the Axis powers, but they have not succeeded so far. It has also been heard that since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the German side has often allowed Japanese observers to obtain all kinds of information and observations that the British and Americans cannot obtain. Tokyo's view of the outcome of the Soviet-German war is almost entirely different from what Berlin has publicized on key points and is similar to what Haliman reported to the US President on Sunday. Judging from the situation, Tojo and his cabinet members obviously want to handle things cautiously. It is heard that the Japanese Emperor even instructed them not to act rashly in matters related to US relations. According to speculation, Japan's greatest interest at present is to exert various pressures on China militarily and politically in the hope of ending the Chinese incident. Now there are even rumors that Tokyo and Chiang Kai-shek's entourage have indeed had some contact and are currently under study.

US Women's Groups Ask to Mediate the Sino-Japanese War

Washington, 23rd (United Press) - The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom urged President Weisford and Secretary of State Hull yesterday to quickly mediate the Sino-Japanese war. The women's community said that the United States should cooperate in actively mediating Far Eastern issues, such as negotiating commercial agreements with Japan and canceling the Exclusion Act. A new policy should be adopted towards China, so that the British, American, and Japanese concessions should be returned to China, all foreign troops should be withdrawn from China, and all foreigners should give up all extraterritorial rights in China.

### Olay Urges Congress to Quickly Approve Merchant Ship Armament; Hull Criticizes German Terrorist Policy; All Crew Members of the Lehigh Ship Rescued

Washington, 23rd (United Press) - White House spokesman Olay yesterday actually urged Congress to quickly abolish Articles 2 and 6 of the Neutrality Act (the provision prohibiting merchant ship armament), allowing American ships to sail anywhere on the seven oceans under the protection of their own cannons and flags. After the announcement on Tuesday that the ninth and tenth ships managed by the United States had been sunk, Olay issued a statement to the press. Olay read the main points of the President's message to Congress on October 9, requesting (1) the abolition of Article 6 as soon as possible to allow merchant ships to be armed, (2) Congress to give "early and earnest attention" to the abolition of Article 2, and open the ports of belligerent countries to American ships.

Washington, 23rd (United Press) - Secretary of State Hull criticized Germany yesterday, saying that the sinking of the American ship Lehigh in the South Atlantic was the best example of "the Nazi attempt to create terror, threats, and lawless policies on the high seas." He said that Germany's procedure aims to intimidate countries like the United States, preventing them from completing the necessary self-defense. He said that many people in the government are seeking to abolish the two provisions of the Neutrality Act to allow American merchant ships to enter the ports of belligerent countries, which is one of the reasons.

Washington, 23rd (United Press) - Twenty-two missing crew members of the American freighter Lehigh have landed in Freetown, Africa. The Maritime Commission said that all crew members of the ship were reportedly rescued.

### The US Navy Assumes a Major Mission to Maintain Freedom of the Seas

New York, 23rd (United Press) - Rear Admiral Andrews, who was appointed to serve on the new American destroyer "Bristol", warned yesterday, "The Navy Department has a major mission at the moment." It is noted that the "Bristol" is a sister ship to the "Cole," and the two ships are among the first twelve destroyers recently built. Rear Admiral Andrews said, "We must maintain freedom of the seas, remembering that the fate of a ship in war is tied to one person. In the shortest period of time, we will encounter this test."

### A Major War Will Soon Break Out in the Libyan Region

German and Italian Troops Equipped for Desert Warfare Arrive in North Africa to Prepare to Deal with British Troops

German Border, 23rd (Reuters) - According to news from Milan, the general impression in Italy is that a major war will soon break out in Libya. The British army or the Axis army may take the initiative. German and Italian troops fully equipped for desert warfare have arrived in North Africa, except for those lost in the convoy. Italian General Bastico has completed his inspection of the Axis forces in Libya, and the storms in Apia have stopped. The weather is gradually favorable for military operations.

German and Italian Troop Transports Attacked by British Forces

London, 23rd (Reuters) - The Admiralty issued a public statement yesterday, reporting that the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in the Mediterranean reported that the British Navy continued to attack the enemy's supply lines and was quite successful. A convoy of enemy ships protected by many warships was attacked by British submarines en route to Libya. Two supply ships were torpedoed, one of which sank. Another British submarine risked the fire of coastal defenses and opened fire on the Apollonia airfield in the Cyrenaica region, hitting hangars and other buildings.

### The President Madison Turns Back to Honolulu; US Maritime Association Announces Construction of 263 Ships

Honolulu, 23rd (United Press) - The President Madison, ordered by the US Navy Department to report to the port of a "friendly country" nearby, returned to Honolulu yesterday morning. The ship left here on October 12 and is believed to have traveled 1,400 miles in four days of sailing east. However, it returned due to the order issued by the Navy Department last Saturday. It is believed that the ship will set sail again today. There are more than 100 Chinese passengers on board, who were forced to leave Panama for Shanghai before the recent coup there.

Washington, 22nd (Havas) - The Maritime Commission announced that it will build 263 small ships to supplement the losses of British ships and develop American shipping. The plan to build 1,200 large ships is still proceeding as usual.

### Japan Plans to Build an Airport in Macau

New York, 23rd (United Press) - Last night, an Australian radio station broadcast a report from Shanghai saying that Japan is currently planning to build an airport in Macau. This move is similar to the nature of the new route from Japanese-controlled Isla Palma to Timor, which was opened under the recent Japan-Portugal agreement. The construction of this base will give Japan an advantage over Hong Kong's air routes by occupying the sea and air, and will control the sea and air routes from Manila and Singapore to Hong Kong.

### International Conference of Anti-Aggression Representatives

London, 22nd - Representatives of the invaded countries have recently established the International Conference in London.

Sir Cecil is the chairman. Several Chinese expatriates have now joined the conference and elected Guo Bingwen as their representative.

### Icelandic Cabinet Resigns

Icelandic Capital, 23rd (United Press) - The Icelandic coalition cabinet resigned yesterday due to disagreements on maintaining living standards, increasing salaries, and other issues related to the influx of British and American troops.

### US Route for Supplying the Soviet Union Will Take the Route to Akancha, the Vladivostok Route Will Be Abandoned

Washington, 23rd (United Press) - The US Maritime Commission announced yesterday that after October 28, the commission will abandon the Vladivostok route for supplying the Soviet Union. The Commission stated, "From now on, transportation will take the route to Akancha because the quantity of supplies needed by the Soviet Union is constantly increasing. From now on, American supplies will be shipped from Boston, so that various ports can be used to avoid congestion. Officials denied that this change was a concession to Japan. Well-informed circles said that they believed that the United States adopted Akancha for several reasons. They said that the oil storage in Vladivostok has reached saturation, and the Soviet Union is now feeling that the long Siberian Railway is insufficient. The port of Vladivostok is also freezing. The route from Boston to Akancha is more direct and can obtain the advantage of quick delivery. The reason why this route was not adopted before was because of the winter freezing, but the Soviets now say that there is a way to keep the port open all year round. Another reason for this change is related to the Congressional debate on amending the Neutrality Act, because unless the registration is changed to another country, the US round cannot sail to Vladivostok."

### Changes May Be Made to Personnel of the Central Government

The Issue of Establishing a Ministry of Trade Has Not Yet Been Resolved; Chen Yi Will Soon Take Office as Director-General of Military Supplies

Chongqing - According to news from private sources, there may be slight changes in the personnel of the Chinese government soon. The issue of establishing a Ministry of Trade has not yet been resolved. Although the government has decided in principle to establish this ministry, it is heard that a suitable person has not yet been found for the position of minister. Chen Guangfu has been repeatedly asked to take this position, but Chen has always declined. When Li Guochin, the manager of the Hua Chang Trading Company in New York, recently arrived in Chongqing, there were rumors that Li would be the Minister of Trade, but Li flew to New York after staying in Chongqing for half a month, so the rumors quickly subsided. The Road reporter heard that the government did not ask Li to take this position, because the government and Li never mentioned this matter in their correspondence. Until a suitable person is found, the establishment of the Ministry of Trade may be postponed indefinitely. The road management rights under the Ministry of Communications have been transferred to the Transportation Control Bureau under the Military Affairs Commission, so Yu Feipeng recently went to Kunming to take over various offices and factories. Another important change is that Chen Yi, the former chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, has been appointed as the Director-General of Military Supplies to succeed Yu. It is heard that although Chen has not yet agreed to take office, everyone generally expects that he will eventually take this position soon. (Reuters telegram of the 23rd)

### "Go to the Northwest!" Zhu Jiahua's Broadcast Address

(Chongqing News) Minister Zhu Jiahua broadcasted on the Central Broadcasting Station on September 25th, with the topic "Go to the Northwest." The original text is recorded as follows:

Listeners, I have just returned from a long trip to the northwestern provinces, and the situation in the Northwest is worth introducing to you. If we don't go to the Northwest, we won't know its greatness, and we won't see the greatness of China. Some people who have never been to the Northwest often have two incorrect views: first, they think the Northwest is our borderland; second, they think the Northwest is a barren place. This is completely wrong. From the perspective of China's overall terrain, the Northwest is our hinterland, and Lanzhou is the center of the country, so Premier Sun Yat-sen once had the idea of ​​establishing the capital in Lanzhou. Our country is full of beautiful rivers and mountains, and the Northwest is not only no exception, but our country cannot do without it. We must know that the Northwest is a place where culture gathers, with fertile fields and rich resources. When we talk about the history of Chinese national development, the Northwest is the most valuable. Originally, the Northwest was the birthplace of Chinese culture. Dynasties, especially the Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties, established their meritorious achievements and systems in this area. Therefore, we can see ancient sites everywhere in the Northwest. In the Hexi area of Gansu, we can see the spirit of our ancestors in pioneering and developing the land, and various remains, such as the ancient Great Wall, the Thousand Buddha Caves, and various rare treasures, such as wooden slips, Buddhist scriptures, hand scrolls, and murals. Therefore, Dunhuang is a world-famous archaeological site, and is the object of research for archaeologists from various countries year after year. The climate in the Northwest is most suitable for human health. Even if a person works all day long, he will not feel tired because of the comfortable climate. I think a sick person will surely recover his health quickly after going to the Northwest. Looking at the strong and healthy bodies of the Northwestern compatriots, their ability to endure hardship and hard work truly makes our Southern compatriots inferior. The Northwest contains endless treasures. There are many undeveloped minerals, and the production on the ground can be said to be all-encompassing. In addition, with the irrigation of the Yellow River and various canals, the land becomes more fertile, planting is lush, and the harvest is abundant. All crops are suitable for the soil and climate, so it can be said that you reap what you sow, and everything grows! We can see tree planting and afforestation is beginning there, with several large-scale projects. We can also see herds of thousands of cattle and sheep and convoys of camels, which are not easily seen elsewhere. As for the local handicrafts, such as wool spinning and weaving, are unique to the Northwest. Recently, various machine industries have been held everywhere and are constantly increasing. Operating various businesses in the Northwest has a good environment and many opportunities. If you are engaged in scientific work, there are virgin lands everywhere where you can create and discover new things. If you go to engage in education, there is a great shortage of teachers there, and you will be welcomed everywhere. If you start a newspaper or magazine, everyone is clamoring for "literary people" to go. If you engage in farming or reclamation, there is a lot of wasteland and the land price is very cheap. If you open a factory, there is very little competition and wages are especially low. If you engage in business, all kinds of businesses are easy to do, transportation is accessible in all directions, and there are also international routes... In short, you don't have to worry about not having anything to do when you go to the Northwest, and things will definitely go smoothly. Everyone: The Northwest is vast and rich in resources, but the population density is not enough. What the Northwest urgently needs is manpower. If the land in the Northwest is fully utilized, the resources are fully utilized, and the goods are freely circulated, a large increase in manpower is necessary. If we want to develop the Northwest, we must implement the plan to go to the Northwest. This will not only fulfill the responsibilities of citizens, but also solve personal career and personal life problems. There are many opportunities for various careers there, and the cost of living is relatively low, making it easy to establish a career. The above are all my feelings after personally going to the Northwest to conduct research this time. I hope that compatriots will rise up and quickly go to the Northwest to work!

### Sichuan-Kang Development Company to be Formally Established Next Month

Capital of 70 million yuan, the Central Government will Provide 30 million yuan, Zhang Qun and Deng Hanxiang will Serve as Chairman and General Manager Respectively

Chongqing: The Sichuan-Kang Development Company, which is being prepared by the Sichuan-Kang Construction Committee, will be formally established at the beginning of next month. Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, is scheduled to come to Chongqing at the end of the month to participate.

The company's capital is 70 million yuan, with the Central Government contributing 30 million yuan, Sichuan Province contributing 3 million yuan, Kang Province contributing 3 million yuan, and the remaining 30 million yuan being raised through commercial shares. Half of the amount has already been fully subscribed in Chongqing. The amount raised in the other provinces has not yet been fully reported, but those in charge estimate that the mere 15 million yuan will definitely not be a problem. The purpose of the company is not only to increase production in the rear to meet the needs of the war of resistance, but also to become the industrial center of western China after the end of the war, so as to avoid the disadvantages of concentrating factories along the coast. (Havas News Agency Telegram of the 23rd)

Editorial

### The Safety Issue of the Aid to Soviet Route

With the intensification of the Soviet-German war, how to step up aid to the Soviet Union has become an extremely urgent issue. Britain, which has an alliance relationship with the Soviet Union, believes that it is not yet possible to establish a second battlefield on land at this time, and can only dispatch its air force to destroy the German rear and use its navy to ensure control of the ocean. Therefore, the main task of directly aiding the Soviet Union naturally relies on the United States. Mr. Harriman, the leader of the American delegation to the Soviet Union, has recently returned to the United States and met with President Roosevelt, expressing deep trust in the Soviet Union's combat power, but also frankly stating that the Soviet Union urgently needs replenishment of war equipment and material assistance. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington the day before yesterday, the American president fully agreed with Mr. Harriman's report and has ordered the acceleration and expansion of aid to the Soviet Union. Therefore, the United States' active aid to the Soviet Union is not a problem in essence. The only problem that remains at present is the transportation of these aid goods, especially the safety of the transportation routes.

The Soviet Union's foreign transportation has always relied on four gateways, namely Arkhangelsk in the north, Leningrad in the west, Odessa in the south, and Vladivostok in the east. At present, whether Leningrad and Odessa are still in Soviet hands, they are simply impossible to use due to the blockade of sea routes, and Arkhangelsk is located in a remote area with a longer ice period (170 days per year), and its foreign routes must pass the north coast of Norway, which is currently occupied by German troops, making sailing very dangerous. Therefore, the importance of Vladivostok to the Soviet Union, and thus the importance of the Siberian region to the Soviet Union, has now greatly increased. There is the Siberian Railway connecting Vladivostok and the European Russian headquarters, but the eastern section of this railway is built along the border of Heilongjiang Province, making it vulnerable to Japanese sabotage. Therefore, in recent years, the Soviet Union has built another Baikal-Amur Mainline (BAM), starting from Taishet in the Lake Baikal region, connecting to the Siberian Railway, passing through Komsomolsk to Sovetskaya Gavan (north of Vladivostok). Vladivostok and Sovetskaya Gavan have also frequently developed transportation to Nikolayevsk and the Kamchatka Peninsula further north. Therefore, the Soviet Union's external gateway in the Far East is now fully capable of absorbing aid supplies.

However, Axis Germany has long engaged in collusion and deployments in the Far East. The Soviet Union's Vladivostok or Sovetskaya Gavan, and even the entire Primorsky Krai, is actually completely surrounded. The Soviet Union's Far East garrison is certainly considered to have the strength for self-defense, but it cannot be denied that the Soviet Union's transportation infrastructure in this region is encountering serious external threats. Yesterday, a Washington telegram stated that the US Shipping Board has announced the temporary abandonment of the Vladivostok route for supplying the Soviet Union and has switched to Arkhangelsk. Since the US official has not recognized this change as a concession to Japan, its substantial meaning cannot be interpreted as having felt an external threat. Because based on the transport capacity of the Siberian Railway, it is not easy to believe that the oil storage capacity of Vladivostok has reached saturation; moreover, the facilities and environment of Arkhangelsk are not ideal. Now that the Soviet Union urgently needs to absorb a large amount of American aid, it must go all out to clear the transportation between the United States and the Soviet Union and ensure its safety.

In order to avoid being strongly threatened by the Axis powers, the Soviet Union has two other routes for transportation with the United States besides taking the route through Arkhangelsk: one is through the Bering Strait and the Soviet Union's far north region, and the other is through the Indian Ocean and the Iranian Plateau. (1) Regarding the former, the Bering Strait is only about 50 miles wide, making it easy to pass through, and transportation in the Soviet Union's far north region has also been actively developed in recent years, with a "Great Northern Sea Route Administration" (Glawsevmorputj) established, with Mr. Babanin serving as its director since 1939. He not only manages the transportation affairs of the region, but also holds scientific and military power. At present, large-scale naval and land military bases have been built in Polyarny (near Murmansk), Providence Bay (opposite Alaska), and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky (on the Kamchatka Peninsula) in the far north of the Soviet Union, with Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky especially aimed at Japan; and powerful air force bases have also been established in Dikson Island, Obdorsk, Novy Port, Uelen, and Bolsheretsk (on the Kamchatka Peninsula). While establishing many naval supply stations in the Arctic region, the Soviet Union has also stepped up the development of land transportation and deployed an aviation network known as the "Stalin Aviation Line." After some adjustments, the transportation between the Soviet Union and Alaska in the United States will be directly and closely linked. (2) Regarding the latter, there are two other routes: one passes through India and Afghanistan to Central Asia, and the other passes through Iran. Iran's highways are relatively developed, and the longitudinal railway from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea was completed the year before last, connecting to the Soviet Caucasus region. As the weather turns cold this winter, the center of gravity of the German-Soviet war will definitely shift south, at which time the Iranian transportation line will become even more important. Therefore, the recent joint Soviet-British invasion of Iran to drive out the Nazi fifth column and control its transportation has great strategic significance.

However, these two new aid to the Soviet routes—either through the Bering Strait and the far north region, or through the Indian Ocean and the Iranian Plateau—are probably still not comparable in quantity and efficiency to those taking the route through Vladivostok and the Siberian Railway. And even these two new routes cannot be said to be completely immune to the plundering of the Far East Axis countries. Therefore, even though the United States can have several parallel routes to aid the Soviet Union at this time, the safety of these routes must still be given the most fundamental consideration, and the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and Britain must jointly seek to eliminate the destructive forces of the Axis powers in the Far East. This should be an important key to the entire development of the Far East situation in the near future.

### Soviet Chief of Staff Appointed Commander of Central Front

Soviet Counteroffensive Around Moscow Gains Momentum, Signs of Exhaustion Appear in German Marching Offensive

Reuter, Kuybyshev (Samara), 23rd - General Zhukov, Chief of the Soviet General Staff, has been appointed commander of the central front, replacing Marshal Timoshenko amidst fierce fighting in Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets. Simultaneously, while announcing Zhukov's replacement of Timoshenko, the Pravda stated that despite suffering extremely heavy losses, the German army continues to dispatch troops to reinforce the brutal fighting around Moscow. The sector commanded by Zhukov, including the front 120 kilometers west of Moscow, has become the most critical area of the entire war. Assisting Zhukov is Lieutenant General Artonanov, commander of the Moscow garrison. (According to our correspondent, the Samara dispatch did not reveal whether Timoshenko was reassigned, recalled, or dismissed.) Today marks the 22nd day of the German offensive on Moscow, yet life in the Soviet interior remains normal, as if unaware of the war. The government has intensified work and increased motorization. The government and Zhukov are currently preparing Moscow to resist German attacks and organizing vast and structured resources to defend Moscow's rear. The nature and strength of the Soviet forces and equipment in reserve remain unknown, but the government's preparations lead people to believe they must be very substantial. The Soviet government, relocated east of Moscow, continues to conduct official business as usual, and the populace remains calm and orderly, showing no signs of discouragement.

Reuter, London, 23rd - According to recent reports received here, there are various signs that the German offensive on Moscow has, at least temporarily, reached a point of exhaustion. The Soviets have inflicted heavy damage on the German air force, with many German aircraft crashing and being damaged while landing on waterlogged airfields, preventing them from taking off to evade Soviet attacks. The Moscow Gazette stated that as of last Sunday, no fewer than 500 German aircraft had been destroyed on land in the central sector. The entire Moscow battlefield is now covered in snow, with biting winds that cut like knives. Roads are knee-deep in mud.

Reuter, Moscow, 23rd - The Soviet midnight communiqué stated that after days of intense fighting, the Soviet army withdrew from Taganrog on the Sea of Azov (approximately 50 miles west of Rostov) after killing and wounding 35,000 German soldiers. Yesterday, Soviet forces engaged the enemy along the entire front, destroying 34 enemy aircraft on Tuesday, while losing eight Soviet aircraft. Seventeen German aircraft were shot down near Moscow on Tuesday and fourteen yesterday.

Reuter, London, 23rd - Soviet forces are currently launching fierce counterattacks around Moscow. There have been no significant changes in the overall situation. The German forces from Leningrad south to the Ilmen front are now adopting a defensive posture. In the south, after the Soviet withdrawal from Taganrog, the situation in its vicinity is reportedly severe. It is said that in this area and elsewhere, the Germans have a large advantage in the number of tanks. Soviet authorities have ordered Soviet soldiers to destroy enemy tanks at all costs and have urged Soviet workers to redouble their efforts to produce tanks. Recent reports from the front indicate that the Soviet army is taking advantage of the adverse weather conditions to hinder the German advance. The Soviet side claims that the German advance towards the Donets River basin has slowed, and the German advance on Rostov has been temporarily halted. In the Orel region, halfway between Ukraine and Moscow, German forces have not exerted further pressure since the successful Soviet counterattack. It is reported that the Germans are now using small units, each with three to five tanks and twenty motorized vehicles, to seek out weak points in the Soviet lines. Positions west of Moscow are repeatedly lost and regained. In the northwest, near Kalinin, in the area where the Leningrad railway crosses the upper Volga River, the Germans attempted to launch another offensive but were met with fierce Soviet resistance. Reports from Moscow indicate that enemy troops who crossed the river have been annihilated.

Around the City of Moscow, Millions of Workers Dig Trenches

TASS, Moscow, 23rd - As Moscow faces a critical situation, countless socialists, non-party members, workers, employees, and cultural figures are going to the socialist party committees, city military committees, and the Krasnaya Presnya district every day, requesting to be sent to the front to defend Moscow. An army composed entirely of volunteers has been formed in two days. This army is stationed at a certain gate in Moscow and is currently undergoing intensive training. Fortifications are being built rapidly, and millions of laborers are helping to dig trenches and set up anti-tank guns and machine guns. Under the command of Dr. Arseniev, a worker from a legal institution, defensive positions were built non-stop yesterday. Their enthusiasm for work is unprecedented. "Work for the front, work for victory" has become their slogan. Factories produced massive amounts of military equipment in a single day yesterday. In addition to the armies organized by workers, factories have also formed factory guard teams. This is the daily life of the people of the Krasnaya Presnya district. They have an unwavering determination to do everything in their power to defend Moscow and turn the gates of Moscow into a graveyard for Hitler's followers.

In the Rostov Area, the Germans are Forced to Adopt a Defensive Posture

Reuter, London, 23rd - According to recent reports from the southern front, in certain areas around Rostov-on-Don, Soviet forces have halted the enemy advance. The Germans, unable to resist or counterattack, have been forced to adopt a defensive posture. Fighting in the Taganrog area continues to be intense. Regarding Moscow, the Soviet news agency reports that German pressure near Orel has eased, and they are now attempting to penetrate Soviet lines with small units. Enemy tanks attempted to cross the N River but were prevented by Soviet forces, with not a single tank making it across. As for the Soviet-held bank, twenty enemy aircraft were destroyed by the Soviet Air Force at the Orel airfield. On the highway leading to the area, twenty-three enemy tanks, eight armored vehicles, eleven trucks, and fifteen transport vehicles were also destroyed. Yesterday, the German High Command announced in a communiqué that the German army and its allies had gradually expanded their occupation of the Soviet industrial area in the Donets River basin. German forces south of Belinsk cleared the battlefield, captured another 5,000 enemy soldiers, and seized one heavy tank and 56 artillery pieces. Yesterday's Soviet supplementary communiqué reported heavy German losses in the southwest (largely referring to Ukraine). It claimed that in one sector of the front alone, German forces suffered over 5,000 casualties in five days due to attacks by Soviet infantry and tanks. Near the village of Mossomovka, 300 German corpses, ten destroyed tanks, thirteen anti-tank guns, and six armored vehicles were left on the battlefield. In another sector of the front, the Soviet Air Force assisted the ground forces, bombing and killing 25,000 enemy soldiers and destroying 327 trucks, 45 artillery pieces, ten motorized vehicles, and 300 vehicles carrying grain and ammunition.

Stalin and Kalinin Both Remain in Moscow

Reuter, London, 23rd - Moscow Radio announced today that Stalin and Chairman Kalinin will remain in the eastern city of the Soviet Union. Yesterday, Stalin issued an order promoting several air force officers. At the same time, he also awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, the Order of Lenin, and the Gold Star Medal to those who had fought bravely and exemplified the execution of orders.

### Chips Absorbed Drier and Drier, Gold Price Exceeds 16,000 Yuan Mark, Six Consecutive Days of Increases Totaling 5,590 Yuan

Yesterday's spot trading was completely manipulated by reckless speculators. First, they pressed down, then vigorously raised prices, creating a day of breathtaking fluctuations of 1,940 yuan. At the opening, Tianjin interests heavily sold 300 to 400 taels, once pushing the price down to 14,460 yuan. However, in an instant, a certain bank and the Hong Kong-Chaozhou group showed a tendency to acquire, and the chips suddenly dried up, causing the price to soar. In the afternoon, a new high of 16,400 yuan was reached, a squeeze of 1,580 yuan. The six consecutive days of increases totaling 5,590 yuan can be described as an unprecedented speculative frenzy. Trading volume was 4,500 taels.

Spot Fluctuations Near 2,000 Yuan

The upward trend in spot prices is difficult to curb and there have already been swings along the way. From the early morning news of Tianjin interests selling, it was 200 yuan lower. De Fu offered 20 taels of "composite" at 14,600 yuan. De Fu and others scrambled to sell, and the price once retreated to 460 yuan. Unexpectedly, Ming Feng and the He Tai Bank successively entered the market, causing the price to soar and break the 5,000 yuan mark. The rise became even faster, totaling over 1,000 yuan. Wan Feng entered the money business with 10 taels at 5,850 yuan. Suddenly, there were certain Sino-Japanese rumors, causing a sharp reversal and decline. Tian Yuan and others scrambled to exit, causing a plunge of 950 yuan to 14,900 yuan. Xiang He vigorously entered with 200-odd taels, exiting in an instant, and closed at 15,150 yuan in the afternoon. In the afternoon, buyers were eager to enter, and the price was raised to 700 yuan. He Sheng began to enter with 10 taels from Zhong Xing, opening high at 550 yuan. A certain bank and Tong Kang Yong vigorously sold, falling back 350 yuan. Soon, Ming Feng and others started another surge, sellers disappeared, and the price soared again by 1,050 yuan, seeing a new high of 16,400 yuan. Tian Yuan exited again, as did Xiang He, falling to 6,160 yuan. Tian Bao bought in, rising another 200-odd yuan. The market closed at 4:00 PM at 16,380 yuan, an increase of 1,580 yuan compared to the previous day. It has risen for six consecutive days, totaling 5,590 yuan. There were fluctuations of 1,940 yuan on the day. The gold shop's list price for gold was 16,500 yuan, with a reduction of 500-600 yuan for purchases.

Futures Also Squeezed Up 700 Yuan

The October futures market opened in the morning, immediately rising 50 yuan to 8,650 yuan, due to the rise in spot prices. Xiang Xing Yong compensated for short positions on behalf of customers, raising the price to 700 yuan with no sellers. It closed at 8,720 yuan in the afternoon. The market opened 80 yuan higher in the afternoon, and Xiang Xing Yong continued to push for entry, but still had few counterparts, so it rose to a high closing price of 9,300 yuan at 4:00 PM, squeezing up 700 yuan. There was a high-low range of 650 yuan on the day.

Jewelry and Sycee Silver Both Soar

The retail price of jewelry gold at silver shops, Da Tong Heng and Xin Tong Heng, increased from 1,490 yuan in the morning to 1,620 yuan, and then dropped back to 1,550 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it rose again to 1,670 yuan at 4:00 PM, a squeeze of 160 yuan (purchases reduced by 60 yuan). There were twelve changes in the price in one day. Sycee silver also increased by two yuan, reaching 14 yuan per tael.

### US Exchange Rate Too Expensive, Transactions Difficult, Gold Notes Not as Firm as Gold Pounds

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw both the Central Bank and HSBC posting flat rates. The HSBC small counter also had fixed exchange rates for British and American currencies. The black market for British and American currencies trended towards tightness, entirely because the price of gold was rising, causing suppliers to hoard and refuse to release supply. A certain broker actually quoted a selling price of only three yuan on behalf of Chinese merchants, but importers, although eager to buy, were unwilling to pay too much. Many even offered 3.25 yuan to enter the market, but no transactions were heard throughout the day. Until the late closing at 4:00 PM, the British exchange rate tightened to 2 shillings 0.0625 pence, and the US exchange rate to 3.125 yuan, both unprecedentedly high prices, tightening by 0.0625 and 0.025 yuan respectively compared to the previous day.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a surge, with British and American gold pounds each rising by a substantial 60 yuan. The trend of British gold notes remained relatively stable, while American gold notes did not rise as sharply as British and American gold pounds. This is because gold pounds are ultimately coins, while American notes are paper money. Therefore, many people sold off American notes and invested in spot gold and gold pounds, leading to a surge of American note sales and limiting the extent of the increase. The trend of Hong Kong notes remains firm. Japanese and Korean gold notes also trended upwards, with the former rising to 3.40 yuan and the latter to 2.65 yuan.

Government Bonds Rise to Cover Shorts

The government bond market suddenly rebounded yesterday, triggered by the covering of temporary short positions from the previous day, causing general shorts to enter the market. Although there was a small correction in the middle, with Class C bonds seeing a low price of 65.5 yuan, it was immediately followed by a sharp rise, with a high price of 7.3 yuan. Buyers were all covering shorts and there were no investment transactions. Class C bonds opened in the morning at 66.4 yuan, looking peaceful compared to the previous day. In an instant, it broke through 6 yuan and saw a low price of 65.5 yuan. Afterwards, with large-scale short covering, it broke out of 6 yuan again. In the afternoon, there was an intention to push up prices again and re-cover short positions. Class C bonds once again broke through 7 yuan. According to daily statistics, except for Class D bonds, which continued to decrease by 0.3 yuan, all others increased by 0.1 to 0.6 yuan. Transaction volume was 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.

In stock trading, 600 shares of Wing On Company were traded at 42.5 yuan per share. The following dividend was declared by rubber stock companies:

Final Interim

Berham 0.18 Garendon 0.04

Sengkrat Deoli 2.75 Bertram Anon 0.10

Kota Bahru 0.20 Consolidated 0.45

Tomiran 0.60

Supreme 0.50

Johore 0.00

The opening of the stock market at the General Chamber of Commerce was stable, then turned uncertain, and the trend was also slightly soft. The market situation did not improve until a few minutes before the close. Jardine's Brewery shares saw a very large trading volume, and the price rose by about one yuan. Steel shares also rose by 2.5 yuan. Rubber shares were relatively quiet.

### Limit-Up for Four Consecutive Days, Uncertain Outcome for Shuang Ma, Spot Sales Completely Eliminated: Coarse Yarn 200 Yuan Cheaper

The yarn market continues to be at its daily limit-up, and the market situation is chaotic. This is due to the surge in gold prices, which makes people feel uncertain, but actual transactions have been completely eliminated. Twenty-count Shuang Ma factory orders immediately reached the limit-up level when they opened, and the price of 2,410 yuan was announced to have stopped trading. There were some dark market sales, which pulled back to 385 yuan. Later, the exchange rebounded, and buyers returned, gradually rising to 445 yuan. By this time it was 10:30 AM, and everyone dispersed. After 12:00 noon, it was heard that the exchange's cotton cloth was slightly soft, and it was said that someone wanted to sell at 400 yuan, but few accepted. The market closed as usual in the afternoon. However, the exchange rebounded again at the close due to the return of high gold prices. As for the price of spot yarn, it is 100-200 yuan cheaper than Shuang Ma factory orders. The future of the yarn market is uncertain. Generally, prudent people adopt a cautious approach, because it is running wild every day, at its daily limit-up for four days. Once it hits a wall, there may be bloodshed. This kind of situation is not good for the yarn industry.

The soaring price of Jin Shuang Ma has no end in sight. Although a notice was issued requiring prior payment of margin, it failed to curb the momentum of acquisition. Factory orders have been at their daily limit-up for four days, causing panic. Those short are unable to cover their positions, and new longs are also likely to shrink back. Therefore, although the market price is high, trading has become scarce. October futures opened in the morning because they had not increased sufficiently yesterday, opening at the daily limit-up of 2,269 yuan, and December at 2,290 yuan, 52 yuan higher. The market then went down to 2,258 yuan, and January to 2,280 yuan. Later, due to the unstable fluctuations on the exchange, it also dropped to 2,270 yuan. The market closed at noon, with each increasing by 30 to 100 yuan. In the afternoon, after the near-term positions made up the margin, trading reopened. Although there was no market for factory orders, the cotton exchange suddenly increased to its daily limit-up at the close, and people speculated that it would rise again. November surged to 2,355 yuan at the close, a dramatic increase of 185 yuan. December was 2,358 yuan, and January was 2,355 yuan, each up 100 yuan. A table is listed below.

### After Stopping New Purchases, the Search for Stockpiled Spot Cloth Becomes More Urgent

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, because the cotton exchange stopped new trading, hoarders became even more eager to find spot cloth, and the actual demand in the street market and the occupied areas was strong, causing cloth prices to skyrocket. The price of white goods, coarse and fine cloth and twill increased by 5 yuan to 7.25 yuan per bolt, a new record for the price increase in the cloth market. Due to the wait-and-see attitude of the factories, there was more demand than supply for bleached and dyed cloth and Luen Cheong and Ewo printed cloth bolts, and there was very little trading. The street market traded several thousand bolts of cloth. However, although the demand for goods in the occupied areas such as Dinghai, Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang, and Nanjing and Hangzhou was strong, it was still difficult to obtain removal permits.

Eastern Cloth: After the suspension of new trading in white goods futures, the spot market became lively. It is believed that due to the soaring price of gold, which has no end in sight, speculators are pushing up prices, becoming more and more intense. The latest evening price for Longtou fine cloth bolt was 85.7 yuan, and the price of other miscellaneous fine cloth fine twill also increased by 6-7 yuan per bolt. The morning price for Four Gentlemen Serge was around 2.8 yuan, gradually increasing to 3.15 yuan in the evening, but the rise was too violent, and the reaction will be easy.

### What is the Reason for This Rising Wind?

This sharp rise began after the Double Tenth Festival holiday, and after two weeks, the situation is completely different from what it was then. The price yesterday, the increase compared to the previous day, and the price on the 11th are listed below.

### Rice Prices Jump Wildly, All Exceeding Government-Controlled Rice, Concerns About the Quality of Government-Controlled Rice

The Ewo cargo ship from Jardine Matheson, the Fook Sang, arrived at the port at around 2:00 PM yesterday, with 5,100 bags of imported rice from Hong Kong, docked at the Roosevelt Pier to unload. (祖)

The upward trend in imported rice became increasingly vigorous. The market opened with the highest price, and after a period of consolidation, it was followed by a step-by-step rise. The prices from Ing Wah Sze had not risen enough the day before, and saw greater activity. The small milled rice from Kiao Chiao Road opened at 178 yuan, then increased from 180 yuan to 182 yuan, which was a jump of 12 yuan compared to the formal price on the day before yesterday. Small milled spot goods opened at 150 yuan and increased to 155 yuan. No. 1 Saigon opened from 164-5 yuan to 170 yuan, and No. 2 opened from 151-2 yuan to 159-8 yuan, all increasing by 7-8 yuan compared to the evening price before. In the afternoon, the buying sentiment increased, the hoarders became even more greedy, and the market price increased by another 2-3 yuan. However, because the Municipal Council used foreign exchange to settle, there were continued inquiries about 9,000 tons of small milled rice at the previous price of 139.76 yuan, and it was rumored that an agreement was possible, so people's minds turned to calm, and the market price returned to 2-3 yuan. The evening closing price was the same as the afternoon closing price. The total transaction volume was more than 30,000 bags, as well as 1,600-700 tons. Other varieties such as No. 1 Tuo Luo opened at 165 yuan, No. 2 at 152 yuan, Min Tang at 157 yuan to 154.5 yuan, Yinhang small milled rice at 155.5 yuan, and Waihang at 154.5 yuan and 154 yuan. Broken pointed rice was as high as 123 yuan, and then 120 yuan, also higher than the Municipal Council's small milled rice. Therefore, the standard of 40% broken rice seems to be that what is sold on the market recently may not be limited to this number, because there are extra fine particles. There are those who say that this is also an inevitable trend. Now a 158-jin bag of small milled rice sells for more than 150 yuan, and the Municipal Council's 160-jin bag sells for only 117 yuan, which is cheaper than broken rice. How can what is sold on the market not be of poor quality, not to mention the color of the Municipal Council's rice. Ordinary eaters only know that the rice shops say that this is the kind of goods, that is the kind of goods, "a blind man looking at a painted wall," and there is no way to tell the quality. Therefore, to run a government sale, there must be only one, and no exceptions are allowed, so that there is a way. But those who are used to doing business, regardless of Chinese or Western, always look at it from a business perspective. In the past week, the price of imported rice has skyrocketed by more than 20 yuan, and has already exceeded the highest peak of the last spring by more than 10 yuan.

Glutinous rice of both thick and thin, new and broken varieties, surged by more than ten yuan. The prices of early broken rice from southern ports, new glutinous rice from Kunshan, and Qingjiao kilned Fengjing Hundred Ge each reached 178 yuan, while Ye Dao from Sijing was particularly outstanding due to its freshness in both dynasties, selling for 180 yuan. However, the prices varied in the early morning, generally around 171 yuan to 173 or 174 yuan.

The price of glutinous rice increased by only 3-4 yuan compared to before, with Hong Kong white rice opening as high as 182 yuan, and then 178 yuan. The price of yellow glutinous rice was only 175 yuan. However, the market price of glutinous tea continued to soar by 7-8 yuan due to the scarcity of goods and insufficient distribution, opening as high as 172.5 yuan, and then 169 yuan.

The buying sentiment for flour was vigorous, and speculation was particularly active. Fort opened at 45.9 yuan, then increased to 46 yuan. Golden Dragon increased from 44.57 yuan to 45 yuan. In the afternoon, long holders who had made profits, in view of the need to realize profits through selling, took the opportunity to return, and the market returned by 0.1-0.2 yuan. The closing price for Fort was 45.89 yuan, Golden Silk 45 yuan, and Golden Dragon 44.89 yuan, each up 0.7-0.8 yuan compared to the previous market. The transaction volume was still 70,000-80,000 bags.

The Continuous Flow of Sugar Northward Stimulates a Sharp Rise in Market Prices

Although it is said that the recent sharp rise in sugar prices was caused by the stimulation of the high gold market, there are two other reasons: (1) In North China, due to the inability to obtain foreign exchange, the direct purchase of sugar has decreased, while the demand has increased, so it has become a trend to transport it from the Shanghai market. Therefore, sugar had just been imported yesterday, and this afternoon 20,300 bags were loaded onto the Taikoo Company's Liangzhou and transported to Tianjin. Furthermore, Jardine Matheson's cargo ship Fook Sang, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday, brought 1,800 bags of granulated sugar from Hong Kong and will still transport them to Tianjin on the original ship tomorrow. It can be seen that the number of sugar transported from Shanghai to North China is large, and how can the market price not rise accordingly? (2) Due to the increased transportation, hoarders are led to hold out for higher prices. Therefore, although high prices are repeatedly offered, hoarding is not reduced. Because hoarding does not decrease, the market price is even higher. This cyclical cause and effect leads to sugar prices being unaffordable. Only yesterday, some hoarders took advantage of the high prices to release some sugar, and the trend turned flat.

### British Residents Support Management of Commodity Prices, Suggest Forming Import Association

If Retailers Raise Prices, Supply will be Cut Off, the Public Should Assist the Authorities' Measures

Municipal Council Resolves to Entrust Jardine Matheson with the Preparation of Low-Priced Flour

The British Residents Association held its bi-weekly meeting at the clubhouse on the Bund on the 21st, chaired by Mr. Coultrap. It was decided that the annual meeting will be held at the racecourse at 5:30 PM on the 7th of next month. At that time, the British Consul General, George, will attend and speak on the War Time Fund.

Public Sympathy is Beneficial and Practical

During the meeting, the issue of managing commodity prices was discussed. It was believed that the British Residents Association should wholeheartedly support the authorities' measures, as public sympathy can assist the authorities in overcoming many difficulties. Some people believe that retailers are largely responsible for disrupting commodity prices at present, so it was suggested to form an association of import merchants to refuse to supply goods to those who violate the legal prices. This move will certainly be of great help in managing retail commodity prices.

Entrusting Jardine Matheson with the Preparation of Low-Priced Flour

The Public Concession Municipal Council, at its special meeting last week, resolved to continue to sell low-priced flour, similar to the method of selling low-priced Hong Kong rice. According to information obtained by a Greater China News Agency reporter, the Municipal Council is still entrusting the British firm Jardine Matheson with preparing the matter. The firm has now begun to investigate the business situation and sales volume of the wholesale merchants and retail stores in the city that distribute flour. Once the investigation is completed, it will be reported to the authorities for reference. At the same time, the Municipal Council is requesting the Stabilization Fund to apply for foreign exchange to transport and sell flour. According to banking sources, the Stabilization Fund may approve it.

After Supplying Foreign Exchange, the Selling Price can Fall

According to a reporter's investigation, the actual daily sales volume of flour in the city is 10,000 bags, and the monthly demand is 300,000 bags. The current price per bag has been manipulated by speculators to more than 40 yuan. If legal foreign exchange can be obtained, the selling price can be reduced by more than ten yuan. It is heard that the low-priced flour will be supplied by a large flour mill in Hong Kong. The mill is very large in scale, and there is no need to worry about a shortage of supply to meet the city's needs. It is also learned that the Futung and Foohsin flour mills in the city have suspended work for several months due to the Japanese monopoly over the source of wheat from the mainland. As a result, the source of flour for consumption in the city must be transported from the United States, Australia, and other places, which has caused the price to be manipulated by speculators.

Mr. Munce was sworn in yesterday, with Mr. Curling administering the oath. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the President Tyler, which will arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month.

### Powell Frightened Last Night

Bomb Touched His Shoulder, Luckily Did Not Explode and Fell to the Ground

J.B. Powell, the American editor of the "China Weekly Review," has been a journalist in the Far East for many years, upholding justice and enjoying a high reputation. Powell's residence is at the Citibank building on Fuzhou Road, and his office is at 160 Edward Road. Every day, he commutes between his office and residence. As the journey is not short, he often walks. Recently, Powell, feeling the environment was not ideal, hired a bodyguard to accompany him. Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, Powell and his bodyguard left his office on Edward Road and walked to Sichuan Road, in front of the Downer Building, when someone suddenly threw a paper package at him from behind, hitting him on the shoulder, and immediately falling to the ground. Powell was greatly surprised and quickly bent down to examine it, seeing a paper package wrapped in newspaper on the ground. Upon opening it, he was shocked to find it was a hand grenade, fortunately not exploded. His bodyguard turned back to check, but the thrower had disappeared. It is heard that Powell recently wrote an article in the "China Weekly Review" that was quite implicating, which may be the reason for this bombing.

### Allied Nationals in Shanghai Do Their Best to Donate to the National Crisis

Women Collectively Work to Knit Clothes and Socks; British Nationals Collect and Sell Waste Paper, Transferring the Proceeds to England

Yesterday it was learned that the Allied nationals in Shanghai, in addition to donating to war funds, are also making various other contributions. According to a member of the Allied Nationals Joint Committee in this city,

Norwegian nationals in Shanghai are currently sending knitted goods to troops stationed in the Near East. Norwegian merchants and family members of consular diplomats gather weekly to knit woolen socks and underwear to donate to soldiers.

Polish nationals in Shanghai send an average of 10,000 comfort bags to Singapore each month to support the troops. The bags contain cigarettes, razors, toothpaste, sweets, and vegetables.

The British Women's Association has been continuously collecting large quantities of clothing, socks, and other necessities since the start of the European war, transporting them to various central locations in England for distribution to the troops. These items are donated by all parties, not limited to British women.

Greek nationals are also doing their part in the war. Under the leadership of Yannoulatos, the Greek Consul-General, they donate monthly to help the Greek Red Cross. This money is transferred to the Greek government in London.

The activities of Dutch nationals are varied. They also hold weekly meetings and publish an illustrated weekly magazine, with all proceeds donated to military expenses. The former Dutch Minister to China, Sobeck, and his wife founded this weekly magazine and have now been entrusted with a government mission to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies, but the weekly magazine continues to be published. Finally, the British Residents Association's

Waste Paper Committee collects waste paper and sells it to Chinese paper mills. The proceeds are handed over to the British Residents Central War Fund Committee, which, together with other donations, is transferred to the Lord Mayor of London. On average, £10,000 is transferred monthly. As of September 30, waste paper sales alone had yielded over 154,800 yuan.

### American and French Merchant Ships Continue to Operate, Nanyang Shipping is Agile

Overseas Traffic Shows No Signs of Stagnation; World Liners Shorten Shanghai-U.S. Voyage

The Shanghai overseas traffic and cargo transport issues that are closely watched by the general public have not deteriorated due to the trend of the situation. According to a New Voices News Agency reporter's inquiries from authorities in the shipping industry yesterday, Shanghai's overseas traffic routes are still far from a serious stage. The overseas traffic routes that continue to be maintained or are newly emerging after the war include: (1) the American President Lines and its agent, the American Pioneer Shipping Company. American Mail Line and Rootes-Berks Lines and other American Far East Lines, the ships included are the President liner, as well as the Arava, Fleetline, Dorothy, and Halle, etc. (2) the French Steamship Company's D'Artagnan and Kindia, etc., sailing on the Saigon-Shanghai line. (3) the Java Mail Line's Shanghai-Hong Kong-Java line, with ships such as the Tjisaroea, etc. (4) the Dollar Line, such as the Calawaii, Cardina, Carmona, and Capena, sailing between Shanghai, Hong Kong, Manila, Los Angeles, and New York. (5) the KPM Line, represented by the Java Company, whose ships sail from Shanghai to Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, etc., now all transship in Hong Kong. (6) the Burns Philip Line's Shanghai-Australia line. (7) the Jardine Matheson Line's Nanyang line, with ships such as the Glen Line Norseman, sailing between Shanghai-Saigon-Shanghai-Burma. (8) Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Osaka Shosen Kaisha, etc. The cargo transport range of the above-mentioned shipping companies includes the United States, Canada, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaya, Nanyang, Australia, Vietnam, South Africa, and other places. Other European countries cannot be directly reached in practice, but can only be transshipped through the United States, but their importance is not as great as before.

American Flags Flutter on the Pacific

Although the freight rates of the above-mentioned ships have increased, they can always maintain the cargo transport without interruption. In the Pacific Ocean, American ships are now second to none. Between Canada, the United States, Honolulu, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, American flags flutter everywhere. Because the situation is unpredictable, the mission of these ships is extremely important. Since Britain is fully focused on the Atlantic, the Empress liners of the China Navigation Company of Russia, Japan, Asia, and Canada, as well as the mail ships of the British Shipping Company, have all withdrawn from the Pacific and been transferred back to serve military transport. Therefore, the original routes of British ships are all replaced by American ships. Although many American President Liners have been requisitioned for military use, the U.S. Maritime Commission is still rushing to build 200 new ships, scheduled to be completed within the year, allocated to both oceans to maintain shipping. The aforementioned Avana and Fleetline, etc., are all newly built. Therefore, cargo transport in the Pacific can still maintain a normal state. As for the itineraries of American Mail ships being kept secret, it is only for security purposes and has nothing to do with the progress of shipping.

Strive for Agility in Nanyang Cargo Transport

In terms of Nanyang shipping, the most important are the above-mentioned French lines, Java, Warun, Burns Philip, the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Manila line of the American Mail Line, and world liner lines, etc. The ports in this area with the most commercial and industrial characteristics are Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore, Saigon, Yangon, Haiphong, Java, and Melbourne. The trade of Nanyang, in the current situation, is closely related to . The main shipping companies are all undertaken by the United States, the Netherlands, and France. However, since the situation in the Far East once became tense, there was a saying that Dutch ships would suspend their operations in the Far East, but this has not yet been clarified. The ships of the French shipping company generally go directly from Saigon or Haiphong to Shanghai without relying on Hong Kong, and sometimes continue to sail from Shanghai to Japan. The main task is to load necessities such as rice and coal. The Shanghai-Hong Kong-Philippines line of American merchants and the world liner lines are quite powerful. Recently, there have also been ships dedicated to releasing new Jia Slope. The regular route of the World Liner of the American President Company is Boston, New York, the Panama Canal, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Honolulu, Shanghai (at present, American ships generally do not bay Japan), Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore, Ceylon, Bombay, the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, and back to the United States across the Atlantic. This line circles the globe, with Shanghai as its center, which is of great help to cargo transport. In order to expedite Sino-American shipping, the company has shortened the voyage of the World Liner ships, starting from the United States and sailing south to Singapore only, without going to Bombay or the Cape of Good Hope to return to the United States, that is, returning from Singapore and returning to the United States along the original route.

Inland River Shipping Is Extremely Bleak

As for inland river shipping, such as the Huangpu River, Suzhou River, Yangtze River, and Pearl River, various countries competed fiercely for transport ships before the war, but now it is completely monopolized and manipulated. At present, there are many monopolized companies, but their ships are simple and the equipment is poor. Pearl River shipping is also quite bleak. The actions of ships on the Pujiang and Suzhou Rivers are even narrower. Moreover, before the war, Jardine Matheson and Taikoo accounted for the majority of North and South Ocean shipping. Now, because Jardine Matheson and Taikoo ships have been requisitioned for other purposes, and are subject to severe obstruction and restrictions, there has been no improvement.

Transfer of 89 Chinese Ships

According to sources in the shipping industry, since the outbreak of the war, 89 Chinese merchant ships have been transferred to foreign merchants for operation to ensure protection, totaling 139,000 tons. Among them, Portuguese merchants have the most, with 28 ships and more than 11,000 tons. Italian merchants have 14 ships, and their tonnage far exceeds that of Portuguese merchants, totaling more than 30,000 tons. American merchants have one ship, only 31 tons. The detailed statistics are recorded as follows: (1) American merchants, 1 ship, 31 tons; (2) British merchants, 3 ships, 8,566 tons; (3) German merchants, 5 ships, 6,637 tons; (4) Italian merchants, 14 ships, 35,857 tons; (5) Portuguese merchants, 28 ships, 17,174 tons; (6) Norwegian merchants, 7 ships, 21,209 tons; (7) Dutch merchants, 2 ships, 6,525 tons; (8) Greek merchants, 15 ships, 31,299 tons; (9) Other, 14 ships, 1,882 tons.

### Weaving Mills Reduce Work

After Oyam, the Japanese Deputy Commissioner of Customs at Jianghai Customs, issued a notice on October 18 prohibiting the export and transshipment of cotton yarn piece goods and other textiles, various industries in Shanghai have been greatly affected. Although it is stipulated that those with special permits are not subject to this restriction, attempts to transport goods to Hong Kong and various parts of Nanyang, and to various free areas transshipped from Yangon, have been rejected. Only those who can obtain permits are those in the occupied areas. As a result, there is no actual sales transaction in the cotton yarn market, and all are bought and sold by speculators. Cotton weaving, towel weaving, sock weaving, and other factories have been forced to suspend night work or reduce some work. Industries that have always regarded the Nanyang gang as the largest customers have been hit even harder. Recently, foreign merchant ships sailing from Shanghai to Hong Kong have had no cotton yarn or cotton textile exports, and the business of shipping companies has also been affected.

Paulis Industry Labor Dispute Resolved

The labor dispute in the Western-style wood industry, Paulis, has been resolved satisfactorily. The wage increase item has also been agreed upon. Since September, all workers have received a uniform increase of 45%. The workers in each store resumed work yesterday.

### Although Flour Prices Are Rampant, Buns and Mantou Are Not Increased

The People's Essential Food, Related to the General Life

The Shanghai Municipal Council has investigated the total number of flour dealers currently operating in this city in order to handle sales matters in the future. Its flat-price sales method will be realized soon. Recently, various flour products, including biscuits and cut noodles, have successively increased in price due to the shadow of rampant flour prices. It is learned that the Shanghai Buns and Mantou Trade Association issued a notice to all shopkeepers yesterday, the original text of which reads, "At this time of high flour prices and increased costs, the retail price should be appropriately modified, but this time the Municipal Council has detailed plans to deal with the illegal price increases of speculative flour merchants, which is deeply admired. We investigate our buns and mantou foods as a daily necessity for the city's civilians. If prices are increased again, it will be related to the entire society and life. We specially inform all members that before the Municipal Council's flat-price flour method is implemented, we still hope to maintain the original price, with large buns and mantou limited to 5 cents to 1 dime per piece, and no private price increases are allowed, or penalties will be imposed in accordance with industry regulations."

### Japanese Banks Speculate in Cotton Yarn, Losing Millions of Dollars

Due to Jianghai Customs' Ban on Exports, Massive Dumping, Unexpectedly Violent Rebound, Replenishment Too Late

The Mainland News reports that, according to business sources, several Japanese banks here have recently engaged in speculative activities in the Shanghai cotton market, resulting in losses of millions of dollars. First, Japanese banks heard that Jianghai Customs would prohibit all cotton goods from being exported from Shanghai, so they engaged in massive dumping activities in the cotton market, expecting that the result of the export ban would be a drop in cotton prices. Unexpectedly, several days after the export ban, cotton prices soared, with no signs of weakness. Japanese banks hurriedly replenished their positions, but cotton prices rose step by step, resulting in huge losses.

### 9,000 Tons of Coal Arrived, Price Stabilization Association Will Fully Supply Coal to the Shanghai Market Within the Required Range

Large amounts of coal have arrived in Shanghai in recent days. The Panama merchant ship Nort, managed by Jardine Matheson's Foreign Department, brought a large amount of coal from Java, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the God Bless ship of the Elong Company, managed by the same company, also brought 1,880 tons of coal from the Dutch East Indies, which arrived at the port yesterday morning and berthed at pontoons 30 and 30A to unload. Three Taikoo ships also brought large quantities of Kailan coal. The Chengdu ship arrived at the port the day before yesterday (22nd), bringing 2,200 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao. The Suzhou ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday, also bringing 2,500 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao. The Nanning ship arrived at the port on the same day as the Suzhou ship, also bringing 2,400 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao. All three ships are berthing at the Kailan Coal Stack pier to unload. The coal situation in this city has revealed a glimmer of dawn, due to the Price Stabilization Association's approval of the consideration of supply and transfer. However, the Price Stabilization Association pays close attention to the coal supply in this city, giving it the same importance as rice, and will never allow a coal shortage to occur at any time, so there is no need to worry.

### Various Public Groups Telegraph Authorities to Promulgate Measures for Handling Rent, Requesting the Application of the Rent Dispute Regulations of the Provisional Capital, and Requesting that All Levels of Courts in This City Quickly Comply

Various public groups in this city, in view of the increasingly fierce housing rental disputes and the increasingly serious housing problem for citizens, jointly submitted a petition to the authorities, requesting that the Ministry of Justice quickly order all levels of courts in this city to handle rent and lease dispute cases, applying the housing rental measures of the provisional capital, in order to stabilize the people's residence. An excerpt is given below

Original Petition as follows

"Ever since the outbreak of the war, the population of Shanghai has surged, and landlords have taken the opportunity to increase rents arbitrarily. The root cause lies in the fact that landlords are using the urgent need for housing to strictly set deadlines for tenants, ranging from six months to a year. Every time the term expires, they first notify the tenants to move out, forcing them to increase rents and making all kinds of demands, endlessly extracting and taking as they please, increasing the burden on residents day by day, and causing frequent rent disputes. According to the law, there are no provisions to prevent this kind of abuse, allowing this special situation to

Escalate

It is thought that most tenants come from war zones, having already suffered great damage in their hometowns, and come to Shanghai to take refuge, only to be repeatedly subjected to the suffering of landlords' clever seizure and extortion. If this trend is not curbed, how can the people's livelihood endure? It is appropriate to issue laws and strictly restrict them. The provisional capital has promulgated seventeen articles of housing rental measures, of which Article 8 stipulates that if the lease has a term, in addition to the situation where the landlord recovers it for his own use upon the expiration of the term stipulated in Article 11, if the tenant notifies one month before the expiration of the term, continuing to lease under the original lease conditions, the landlord

Must Not Refuse

Article 9 stipulates that if the landlord refuses to accept the rent paid by the tenant on a monthly basis in accordance with the lease, the tenant may deposit the rent in accordance with the law. Article 10 stipulates that if the tenant sublets part or all of the house in accordance with the provisions of Article 443, paragraph 1 of the Civil Code, the rent shall be calculated according to the proportion of the original rent and shall not exceed 20%. Article 11 stipulates that when the lease expires, or if the lease has no fixed term, if the landlord recovers the house for his own use, he must notify the tenant three months in advance, obtain a guarantee from the local Baojia chief, and apply to Chongqing City for permission.

The aforementioned recovered houses shall not be leased in whole or in part to a third party by the landlord within one year. The provisions of the preceding two paragraphs shall apply mutatis mutandis to the transferee under Article 425 of the Civil Code. If the above provisions can be applied to the citizens of this city, they will benefit immensely. We have specially prepared a document requesting permission to telegraph the central government to order the Ministry of Justice to quickly order all levels of courts in this city to handle housing rental dispute cases, applying Articles 8, 9, 10, and part of Article 11 of the housing rental measures of the provisional capital,

In order to stabilize the people's residence

In addition, we also earnestly request your Ministry to quickly issue separate letters to all levels of courts in this city, requesting that all cases involving rent disputes not be pronounced judgment until a clear order is received from the central government, and you will be greatly thanked," and it is also learned that the various public groups will mimeograph and distribute the housing rental measures of the provisional capital, calling on citizens to unanimously advocate for them, and will distribute them to various lawyers as a reference for handling rent dispute cases.

### YMCA Promotes Filial Piety Movement Second Annual Parents' Day

The Boys' Department of the Young Men's Christian Association believes that our country has been known throughout the world as a land of etiquette and righteousness, and filial piety is especially admired by people. At this time of conflict between new and old morals, young people often neglect and despise the way of filial piety, disobeying the wishes of their parents, wasting money, breaking away from their parents, and cases of discrediting ethics emerge one after another. In order to revive the old morals and promote the inherent virtues of thousands of years, October was designated as Filial Piety Month last year (implying not forgetting the ten months of pregnancy), and the last Sunday of the month was designated to treat parents well and present them with gifts of grace (self-created). As the 26th of this month is the last Sunday, it is scheduled to gather members on this day to hold the Second Annual Parents' Day. In addition to preparing tea and snacks to entertain the parents of members, there will also be musical performances. In addition, enthusiastic publicity is being carried out in various church schools and Christian groups to promote filial piety and save the declining trend.

### Carpenters Stopped Work, Nine People Arrested, Many Printing Workers Missing

### Ningbo Siming Bank Deposits Method of Withdrawal in Shanghai

The Ningbo Siming Bank, for the convenience of depositors, has entrusted the Shanghai Siming Branch to extract from the interior on their behalf, and advance payment, but the funds remittance application, remittance fees damage Tian Bu Zi, in addition to the bank to bear part of the subsidy, has to depositors per hundred yuan deduct a remittance of thirteen yuan zero four points, (that is, each hundred yuan deposit payment Shanghai bills eighty-six yuan nine corners six points) This remittance rate is based on the exchange rate of the day before the Ningbo incident, in order to inject, in accordance with the actual remittance, it is still far apart, if the depositor wants to extract in the interior, you can open a check, without any remittance fees, uniformly flat payment,

The approval of scholarships for the Shenbao reader scholarship in the categories of university, middle school, and primary school, as well as the industrial and commercial employee category, and the issuance of checks, have been completed long ago. We have been rushing to handle the closing accounts for this period in recent days. Now, it has been found that 30 people have not been cashed by the school at the bank. Our newspaper believes that since the school opening is approaching two months, the uncashed checks are probably because the applicants have not enrolled. In addition to notifying the bank to stop payment immediately, we also ask students who have not enrolled to return the checks to our newspaper immediately in order to clear the procedures. The list of names and check numbers is as follows:

### Thefts in Shanghai (Part 1)

— Bai Min

The prevalence of theft in Shanghai has been rampant, especially in recent years. Robberies and thefts occur daily. Although the methods of Shanghai thieves are not as sophisticated as those of American thieves, their means of selling stolen goods through pawnshops or receivers in the two concessions are similar to those of American thieves. Once property is robbed, it is mostly impossible to find it, because citizens rarely know the details of the stolen items. However, about one-third of stolen property is recovered by the Criminal Division of the Police Department using clever methods. If citizens record the characteristics of easily stolen items, it will be easier for the Police Department to investigate and recover the stolen goods more quickly.

Taking watches as an example, many citizens know the brand names of their watches, but how many remember the numbers engraved on them? Therefore, after pickpockets steal valuable items such as watches in crowds, the original owner often has no way to track them down. Whenever a robbery occurs, the police immediately prepare a list of the names and values of the stolen items. Robbery victims often inflate the value of the stolen property, causing the police officers investigating the case many difficulties and even misleading the investigation, thus delaying the recovery of the stolen goods.

The Criminal Division of the Medical Department issues a notice every day to pawnshops in the Public Concession. The notice is printed in Chinese and English and contains the names of stolen and robbed items. If a pawnshop receives stolen goods listed in the notice, it must report to the Police Department. Detectives investigating robbery cases routinely investigate pawnshops, and if stolen goods are found, there is a possibility of prosecuting the pawnshop owner.

In addition to pawnshops, the city's thieves entrust receivers to sell stolen goods. Receivers often meet with thieves at locations they believe are unknown to the police, exchanging stolen goods for money. Therefore, it is difficult for the original owner to find the lost items, especially jewelry. Among valuables, rings are the most difficult to trace. Receivers often remove the jewels after buying rings and resell them to jewelers, who redesign them and take them to other cities to sell. If the rings are made of gold or silver, they are melted into blocks and sold.

### Landlords Show Understanding, School Building Disputes Decrease

The Shanghai School Building Maintenance Association, established by school staff and enthusiastic educators from all walks of life for nearly a year, specializes in resolving school building disputes and has been instrumental in helping many. According to the person in charge of the association interviewed by the DAHUA NEWS AGENCY, there are thousands of large and small schools in the two concessions. Since the national crisis, some have been forced to close due to pressure from landlords, and many more are suffering and unable to focus on education, which is truly appalling. Therefore, the association was formed to gather the strength of the masses for maintenance, with the sympathy and assistance of the education authorities and people from all walks of life, and the understanding of the landlords. As a result, school building disputes have decreased recently. To facilitate communication with the schools, the association has set up a communication address at Post Office Box 1344.

### Hong Kong Football Association Decides on Interport Games to Be Held in Hong Kong During the Lunar New Year; Other Teams Will Be Invited If the Shanghai Team Cannot Attend

(Hong Kong News) The Hong Kong Football Association held a committee meeting to discuss the venue and personnel for the Poppy Day charity match on November 11, and also made some decisions on the upcoming (1941-1942) Shanghai-Hong Kong interport football match. The Shanghai-Hong Kong interport match has a history of more than 30 years, held once a year, alternately in Hong Kong and Shanghai. In 1938, when it was Shanghai's turn to host the competition, Hong Kong did not send a team due to the Sino-Japanese War. The following year, it failed to materialize for the same reason. In 1940, the Shanghai Westerners' Football Club tried its best to invite the Hong Kong team to Shanghai. The Hong Kong Football Association selected an all-Westerner representative team, led by Dalihanshan Nu, as the leader and captain, to go to Shanghai because the Chinese players were unwilling to participate. As a result, the Shanghai-Hong Kong interport match, which had been suspended for two years, was resumed. The Shanghai team was originally scheduled to visit Hong Kong for a return match during the 1940-1941 football season. Unfortunately, at that time, the Shanghai Westerners' Association again raised issues such as player leave, berths, landing, and guarantees due to the unpredictable situation in the Far East. After many telegrams and letters were exchanged, the Shanghai side finally replied that the environment did not permit it and that it could not be done, and looked forward to next year. Now that the current football season has begun, the Hong Kong Football Association has set the date of February 14, 15, and 16 next year (that is, the first, second, and third days of the Lunar New Year) for the interport match. The Association, in view of the time spent on arranging the previous match, discussed the matter at this month's committee meeting in advance. If the Shanghai team breaks its promise again, other interport matches such as Hong Kong-Philippines or Hong Kong-Vietnam can be arranged as early as possible to add some flair.

### Second Act of Charity Basketball Game: Show Postponed to Tomorrow

The times are also unchanged.

### Black Man Cup Charity Final: Tickets Go on Sale

The Black Man Cup miniature football charity tournament, sponsored by Black Man Toothpaste Factory, will be held this weekend at the Poor Education Institute court. After Ruitang and Yizhong advanced to the final week, both sides were determined to win the championship, and have been working hard in recent days. In order to increase charity income and arouse audience interest, the authorities specially invited Wen Lant亭and Yuan Ludeng to invite the Mixed Team to play against Leyou in an exhibition match. The program is exceptionally exciting. Guests are bound to be crowded at the time, so tickets have gone on sale. The tickets are divided into four types: 10 yuan honorary tickets, 5 yuan sponsorship tickets, and 2 yuan and 1 yuan. The pre-sale points are located at the head office of Huizhong Bank at 579 Henan Road and the Poor Children's Education Institute on Jiaozhou Road. The income from the tickets, excluding expenses, will all be allocated to the funds of the Poor Education Institute and the Poor Children's Arts and Crafts Institute. Those holding the honorary tickets and sponsorship tickets from the previous time can enter the venue to watch. All the prizes have been arranged by Cheng Zhiliang and Wei Shigeng. The championship silver cup is tall and magnificent, unprecedented in miniature football games. The authorities will also award a silver cup to the runner-up, third place, and fourth place to encourage them. The authorities will also present award banners to each team participating in the exhibition match to express their gratitude and to commemorate the event.

### Yiyou Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Finals on the 2nd of Next Month

The Sports Committee of the Society believes that in this complicated environment, in order to be prudent, it was decided to hold it in the Society's auditorium, with the date set for 7:00 PM on the 2nd of next month. No tickets will be sold. Zhang Junyuan, Li Feixiang, Yang Changjia, Li Zaichun, and Yang Changxi were given the right to final. The championship, runner-up, and third-place prizes, as well as commemorative medals, have all been made, and the awards ceremony can be held on a scheduled date after the finals.

The organizers have also scheduled a meeting on the 26th of this month to continue discussing the implementation matters with all relevant parties.

### Quickly Stop the Soaring Prices of Daily Necessities!

— Mu Chang

The soaring prices of daily necessities these days have truly reached a point of "sunstroke"! Citizens are frantic and indescribable. If this continues, how can they bear it! Speculators create rumors and cause trouble, stirring up trouble and fishing in troubled waters. It has reached its extreme! Not to mention hardware building materials, wool fabrics, medicines, and raw materials for the chemical industry, which are handled by them, even the most basic daily necessities are full of traps. The Shanghai Machined Noodles Industry Association suggested to the Public Works Department a few days ago that the existing flour in each warehouse should be assessed at a standard selling price and ordered to be sold publicly. This is a pressing requirement. It is learned that the Stabilization Fund will also approve the Public Works Department's application for flour.

Rice and noodles are indispensable, but at present, a small bowl of Yangchun noodles has risen from 25 cents to 30 cents, then to 35 cents, and then to 45 cents! As for rice, not counting the mixing of inferior rice, the listing of warehouse rice has also been cancelled, and the black market is prevalent, making it difficult for citizens to make ends meet. Fortunately, the authorities have formally announced a refutation of the rumors, and the maximum retail price of foreign rice is still 117 yuan per stone, and illegal sales are strictly prohibited.

What about other daily necessities? Soap has risen from 50 cents to 60 cents per bar; kerosene has risen from 70 cents or 80 cents to 90 cents per catty... Matches have risen from 20 cents to 25 cents per box! In short, everything is rising, and those who hoard make money. Everyone is asking the authorities to manage the prices of various daily necessities, and the authorities have also expressed some intentions.

We believe that at the final juncture, it is imperative to implement public sales and let the authorities be responsible for the import of various items, engaging in citizen consumer cooperation, which is also possible and necessary. Therefore, it is believed that the act of evading transportation to Shanghai, resulting in shortages here, can be corrected by adjusting cooperation or even replacing it. Moreover, hoarding families can still make a lot of profits under standard prices. Now or in the future, warehouses do not mind lacking mountains of goods.

In the past, the authorities assessed and set price limits for rice and coal, and the results were effective. This time, the authorities should manage prices and public sales in response to objective and urgent demands, and there is no fear of failure. However, it is hoped that it will proceed "cautiously" and more "quickly" and "correctly," so that social order can be given more consideration. If not, the hoarding families will cry and make trouble, and the only way is to dispose of them decisively. This can enable the public to escape from water and fire and ascend to comfort. It is also a method of awakening for the hoarding families themselves, saving them from the inevitable situation in the future where someone will use the stockpiled goods in the warehouse for some unpaid application.

### Buying Rice

— Zuo Hui

Because I used to work in a rice store for a short time, I am quite familiar with rice. Therefore, I was assigned to do the rice buying for the whole house.

Standing in front of the counter of the rice store, I picked up a handful of rice and casually asked, "Hey, what's the price of No. 1 rice now?"

"One hundred and sixty-two."

"Oh, let me see a handful—rice that's worth the price." As I spoke, I casually revealed the tone of an insider.

The shop assistant was quite attentive, but when I fiddled with the so-called No. 1 rice in the shop assistant's palm, I showed a look of displeasure, although that kind of rice store trick was what I expected. I asked, "Is this really No. 1 rice?"

"Yes."

"But don't talk nonsense, this is clearly Min rice, and you're still saying it's No. 1!" Min rice has very long grains and is white. Mixed in with rice, it's really something that outsiders can't tell. Some people might even say that this kind of rice mixed with Min rice is good. But if the rice store man wants to deceive me, he's really made a mistake. I said, "Friend, if I wanted to buy Min rice, I would ask you for Min rice. Now I'm asking you for rice!"

The rice store man was a little embarrassed and quickly changed his tune, saying, "We have rice."

"What's the price?"

"One hundred and seventy-two."

"Didn't you just say that No. 1 rice was one hundred and sixty-two yuan? What's going on now?"

"..." The shop assistant couldn't answer.

"The price is too expensive, I don't want it."

The shop assistant was simply getting annoyed with me. But in order to try to get some advantage, I negotiated with him again: "So what's the price of the Public Works Department rice now?"

"We sell it for one hundred and seventeen yuan, the same as other stores."

"Okay, then I'll buy one stone." I said, "But you'd better show me a sample."

The shop assistant handed me a sample of Public Works Department rice. I thought; he must know that I'm an insider, but no, the shop assistant still wanted to deceive me one more time. After looking at the rice sample, I said with displeasure, "Is this Public Works Department rice? Then, then——you haven't cheated people, have you."

The rice store shop assistant timidly said, "How can we cheat customers?"

The words sounded nice, but I suspected that he was cheating me!

"Sir, if you want to buy, we'll pick out one stone that's especially good for you."

After hearing this, I became firm again. I said, "I don't want you to pick out a stone that's especially good. I'm buying Public Works Department rice from you, I just want you to give me Public Works Department rice."

When I left, the shop assistant gave me a deep look. I told them the address, and after a while, the rice was delivered.

### Be Careful When Mailing Letters

— Liu Jie

Yesterday, as I was passing by Jing'an Temple Road, I saw the green mailbox standing alone on the sidewalk, so I dropped off a letter. When I dropped it off, someone else was dropping off a letter there. He dropped it off and ran, not knowing that his letter had leaked out. I picked it up and dropped it in together with mine, but it came back out. It was really strange. On closer inspection, I saw that there was a very large letter leaning slightly outward against the opening. Later, after I touched it several times, it fell down. Judging from the sound, there wasn't just one letter; there were three or four large ones. I wondered who was so careless. You should know that although the mailbox is large, the entrance is very narrow, and the upper and lower lips are very thick.

It is said that in the past, the United States often found letters with missing stamps. One day, a patrolman saw several children reaching into the mailbox, so he arrested them. The result of the investigation was that they had stolen countless letters that were stuck in the mailbox. With this "lesson from the past," we must be careful.

When I mail letters, I often see one or two letters left at the opening of the mailbox. If they happen to be encountered by despicable people, they will steal them, tear off the stamps as before, and then tear up the letters. Wouldn't this be a loss for you?

Leaving the letters at the mailbox opening is not only a loss for him personally, but also has a significant impact on others, just like yesterday's letter. It is as immoral as four or five people walking shoulder-to-shoulder on the sidewalk, and even more so.

### Coming Soon

— February

——Excuse me, sir, have you seen any police officers around here?

——No, I haven't seen a single shadow.

——Very good, then please hand over your coat and wallet to me together.

### Firewood Vendor Cheats and Donates Money to Help Students

To the Editor:

I am writing to inform you that this afternoon, while buying firewood, I noticed that the seller suddenly inserted a small iron block, about an inch long, into the gap where the weight was placed on the scale, adding about 50 catties to the weight (I became suspicious because the weight suddenly increased at that time). I hurriedly checked the scale, and he forcibly pulled off the iron block and tried to run away. Then I realized his fraudulent behavior. Everyone questioned him, and he could not escape. Knowing that he was wrong, he pleaded repeatedly. Considering that he was operating on a small scale, we finally agreed that he would pay ten yuan in national currency to be used for charitable purposes, and said that future transactions would be fair and without deception. Now, I am attaching the ten yuan in national currency to this letter, asking your newspaper to transfer it to the student aid fund to benefit many students. Also, in order to expose the bad habits of merchants in society, I am specifically listing the true facts in the hope that

Your column will publish a corner as a mirror for careful shopping, specially, respectfully wish you peace.

Zhou Qi, No. 3, Lane 1265, Edward Road, 30, 10, 17. Editor's note: This kind of cheating by vendors is quite common in the market, and customers should be aware of it to avoid being deceived. The money sent by Mr. Zhou will be allocated to the student aid fund of this newspaper and will be announced soon.

Fourteen: Living the Life of a Fallen Hero

"Dad, I saw in the newspaper that they're hiring female staff. I'll go try it out later, okay?" Mei Bao said, spreading the borrowed Shen Bao newspaper on her lap, looking very excited.

Qiu Haitang initially strongly opposed it, because he viewed Shanghai as such a terrible place that he simply didn't want his daughter to go out alone and come into contact with the air of Shanghai. Later, Mei Bao said very firmly:

"Instead of sitting at home and stubbornly waiting for death, why not go out and take a chance? It's not like everyone in Shanghai is a bad person!"

In the end, Qiu Haitang accepted Mei Bao's suggestion. They tidied up their clothes together and rushed to the company that had placed the advertisement. This company was indeed very formal, but there were too many people applying; and the minimum qualification they stipulated was a junior high school diploma, which Mei Bao didn't have. Although the examiner was willing to be flexible, Shanghai treats English as the "national language," and commercial institutions pay particular attention to it. Mei Bao received her education in the north from a young age, and her English proficiency was very limited. She couldn't even handle a few conversational sentences, let alone anything else. (244)

### The Problem of Female Performers in Kunqu Opera

— Di Feng

The other day I watched the Shanghai Bank's Kunqu Opera dress rehearsal, which made me suddenly wonder why the Xian Ni Society doesn't train a few female performers? Because Shaoxing opera, Shanghai opera, spoken drama, storytelling, all have graceful and charming women, and they even have to be the leading stars. Shanghai people watch opera and first pay attention to the female roles, especially those who are beautifully made up, move nimbly, have gorgeous costumes, and convey emotions with their eyes. Old and young, wives and concubines, all want to come and enjoy the show.

Kunqu opera has several plays with righteous and inspiring themes, such as Wu Zixu Sending His Son, Su Wu Longing for Home, Jianwen's Tragic Sight, and Zhen'e Assassinating the Tiger. Watching them will not make you lose your ambition. If female performers sing The Good Time and Thinking of the Mortal World, it will suit the tastes of regular theatregoers, and there will definitely be many popular people in the audience.

Someone said to me that singing Kunqu opera requires good vocal power and a master flute player. Women's voices are always soft and delicate. Only Dan roles can barely manage, and it would not be successful to sing Zheng Sheng. However, male and female performances are not related. Chen Miaochang in Qin Tiao and Xie Suqiu in Ting Hui perfectly match their roles. If you're talking about female Lao Sheng singers, they are also extremely rare in Peking opera and spoken drama. Even singing Xiao Sheng might not be suitable, because women have big butts, making stage movements inconvenient. Only Shaoxing opera can add them without any problem.

Suzhou women's original Suzhou dialect is very soft and pleasant to listen to. It is a natural talent. Zheng Chuanjian and Zhang Chuanfang are from this area and can be invited to select two beautiful women from their relatives and friends to learn and practice. Once they are on stage, Kunqu opera can definitely be revived, and it will be sold out.

### Federal Film. Federal Stock is Plentiful

— Mu Feng

The Federal Company is organized by several companies including Tuanlian, Jinxing, Guohua, and Minhua and specializes in Dupont movie film. Now that the source of Dupont film is about to be cut off, this reporter visited Mr. Bian Yuying, the person in charge of the company, who said: "Federal still has more than two million yuan in stock, which can probably meet the needs of various companies until the end of April next year. At the same time, it has already telegraphed the US headquarters to purchase two million yuan, so as to send it as quickly as possible. This batch of new goods will probably also last for about half a year. However, at this time of shortage, Baobang Film, in addition to only supplying to related companies such as Guolian, Jinxing, Guohua, and Minhua, refuses new customer purchases. This matter was decided by the board of directors the day before yesterday."

### Anecdotes from the Flying Curtain Theater (Part Two)

— Que Wei

Yang Baosen's performance of the "Fourth Son Visits His Mother" segment was particularly excellent due to the incorporation of Little Yu's vocal techniques and the subtle accompaniment of Yang Baozong's Huqin, resulting in continuous beautiful melodies. Even the cries of the little barbarian were done in falsetto, which was wonderful. The numerous crying segments, again due to the Huqin's peculiar sound, were truly like the cries of a crane in the sky or the calls of a monkey in the Wu Gorge, making it unbearable to listen to. The "flowing water" melody was like a clear spring washing over rocks, capturing the essence of purity. Apart from the "dangling fur and throwing hair" technique, where it couldn't match Fu Ying, in other aspects, Fu Ying was strong and bold, while Baosen was light and skilled, each having their own strengths, with no clear superiority. Zhang Junqiu's portrayal of Princess Tie Jing was not as pleasing as her portrayals of Su San in "Yu Tang Chun," because wearing the Manchu headdress made her face appear too long, and the rouge, applied from the brow to the cheekbones, made the white powder below the nose seem too much, lacking balance. This should be improved in the future. Her voice was very sweet and smooth, but her vocal skills were not yet deeply refined, demonstrating ample ability but insufficient practice. Compared to Cheng Yanqiu's princess, the scene of guessing her inner thoughts featured different facial expressions and vocal techniques for each guess. The several segments of "flowing water" melody had an unparalleled ability to cut through iron. The regrettable aspect was that the beauty of Cheng's singing lies in the transition from loud to soft and from soft to loud, like a silkworm spinning silk, seemingly broken, continuous, present, and absent, enticing the audience to listen more and more, but making it difficult to hear clearly. Those seated further back might have trouble hearing the details. Some have suggested installing a sound system on the Golden Stage, but the amplified sound would lose its natural beauty. The only solution is for ladies from all walks of life to urge Yanqiu to slightly raise his low notes to satisfy the public's desire. That is probably the best hope.

Chapter 18: Vowing to Eradicate the Huns, Regardless of Personal Safety

However, I left Beijing in haste without taking Yuan Yuan with me, thinking that I would be returning to Beijing soon, so there was no need to go to that trouble. Who knew that before I could even reach Beijing, the rebel bandits had broken into the capital city, and Yuan Yuan had been captured by the rebel leader Li Chuang, her fate unknown. I missed her terribly and couldn't sleep or eat in peace. Although I have now vowed to lead troops to suppress the rebels, the rebel forces are strong, and I fear that I will not be able to recapture Yanjing and drive away the rebel leader soon. What if this drags on for a long time? What will happen to Yuan Yuan then? I think the best plan would be to send someone secretly to sneak into the capital city and rescue Yuan Yuan from Li Chuang's palace. This is the safest plan. But this task must be done by someone with skill to be effective and safe. Therefore, someone like Kunlun Huangshan is especially rare and valuable. Your flying skills are still good, so I was thinking of having you take a trip to Beijing, assess the situation, and act accordingly. Do you think you can handle it well and happily? Bai Twelve listened to Wu Sangui's words and said, "I am obliged to serve you, General, because of your kindness. But I think my martial arts skills are limited, and it would be difficult for me to enter the capital and rescue her alone. The rebel's palace must be heavily guarded, and I dare not act rashly and betray the General's beloved concubine. However, I know that Captain Zhang and Captain Chen are not only excellent in martial arts on horseback, but also possess extraordinary flying skills, far superior to mine. If the General is determined to rescue his beloved concubine, it will only work if you entrust it to a few of them. I am willing to recommend them as replacements." Wu Sangui nodded after hearing this and said, "You're not wrong. Zhang Cangqiu and the others are indeed extraordinary talents. If they are willing to serve me, that would be the best thing. Go find out their intentions for me, okay? (200)
