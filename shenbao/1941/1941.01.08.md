### President Roosevelt Clarifies National Policy: Defends Democracy, Criticizes Dictatorship, Acknowledges Domestic Security is Linked to the International Situation, Resolves to Exert All Effort to Aid Invaded Countries in Resistance, Requests Congress to Grant New Powers to Gain Executive Strength and Accomplish Tasks

Washington – President Roosevelt presented to Congress and the nation a statement on foreign affairs, his words being remarkably clear, unprecedented. Members of Congress and listeners frequently applauded. Every seat in Congress was filled. Observers from the diplomatic corps included the British Chargé d'Affaires and ambassadors and ministers from various South American countries and China, Norway, Argentina, Persia, Switzerland, Finland, and Portugal. However, no representatives from Germany or Italy were seen. (Reuter's Telegram, 7th)

Washington – Yesterday, President Roosevelt addressed the 77th Congress, which was packed to capacity, delivering what is considered one of the most important speeches since President Wilson declared war in 1917. He began by recounting American history since 1789, then stated that while the peace of 1918 was unjust, the appeasement peace pursued before the Munich Conference, now being promoted in various countries under the "new order" of dictatorships, is even more unjust. The American people can no longer avoid confronting this "new order." Even within our peaceful nation, some secretly spread toxic propaganda to undermine its unity and incite unrest. Therefore, democracy is now faltering everywhere, and free nations are under constant attack. In the past sixteen months, this kind of aggression has completely destroyed the lives of many small and large independent nations, and those perpetrating this are continuing their actions. All other nations, regardless of size, are threatened. As the President of the nation, in fulfilling my constitutional duty to report to Congress on the state of the Union, I feel compelled to inform Congress that our future security and our democracy are deeply intertwined with events beyond our borders. Four continents are now arming themselves to defend the survival of democracy. Should this defense fail, the entire people and resources of the four continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia will be controlled by the victors.

Reject Appeasement

It is premature and inaccurate for anyone to boast that an unprepared America, with one hand tied behind its back, can defend the entire world with both hands. I will warn the nation that no realistic American can expect the restoration of international generosity, genuine independence, world disarmament, or any good cause from the dictators' peace. We must consistently reject those who skillfully promote appeasement, and we must be especially wary of a small group of selfish individuals who want to clip America's wings to feather their own nests. Now, some claim that America can avoid direct attacks from overseas. Indeed, as long as the British navy exists, America faces no such danger. Even without the British navy, no enemy would be foolish enough to launch an invasion of America by landing troops thousands of miles across the ocean without a military base. However, as aggressor nations maintain their offensives, they choose the time, place, and method of attack, not us. This is why the future of all American nations is in serious danger today, and why all government officials and members of Congress bear a heavy responsibility.

National Policy Includes Three Points

The national policy of the United States in dealing with international affairs is based on respect for the rights and dignity of all nations, large and small, and on the belief that moral justice will ultimately prevail. This policy can be summarized in three points: first, in accordance with the clear expression of the popular will, regardless of party affiliation, America must proceed with comprehensive national defense. Second, America must provide full assistance to resolute peoples everywhere who, through their resistance, prevent the spread of war to this hemisphere. Third, moral principles and considerations of our own security dictate that America must never acquiesce to the peace dictated by aggressors or promoted by appeasers. America must adhere to these premises.

Accelerate War Production

The President continued, stating that current progress in arms production is not satisfactory. Although warship construction is ahead of schedule, aircraft production is behind schedule. The President stated, "I will ask Congress for a large increase in new funding and grant me new powers to continue the work that has already begun, and to expedite the manufacture of various military supplies to be delivered to countries currently at war with aggressors. Our most beneficial task is to strive to work like an arsenal, not only serving ourselves but also serving the countries resisting aggression. These countries at war do not need manpower, but they need trillions of dollars worth of defensive weapons. The time when they cannot pay cash is not far off. We cannot and will not allow them to surrender because they currently lack the ability to pay for the necessary weapons we know they need. Therefore, I do not advocate lending dollars to repay the debt in the future. I advocate that these countries continue to obtain war equipment in America, and that their orders fit into our own production schedules. The war equipment they order can almost all benefit our national defense in the future. For everything we ship overseas, they will return, after a reasonable period following the war, with the same items or, at our option, with other items they produce that we need."

Undaunted by Threats

We declare to all democratic nations, "We Americans are vitally concerned with your protection of freedom. We are now pouring our capabilities, resources, and organizational strength into giving you the power to restore and maintain a free world. We will supply you with an increasing number of ships, aircraft, tanks, and large cannons. This is our intention and our responsibility." In pursuing this intention, we are undeterred by threats from dictators who claim that our aid to democratic nations that dare to resist their aggression will be considered a violation of international law and an act of war. In reality, even if dictators unilaterally declare such aid to be an act of war, it is not an act of war. If dictators are preparing to wage war against us, they will not wait for us to commit an act of war. Did they wait for Norway, Belgium, or the Netherlands to commit an act of war before attacking them? Their sole focus is on a new and unilateral international law that lacks reciprocity in observance and is merely a tool of oppression in implementation.

Sacrifice to Fight for Freedom

The President continued, stating that everyone must be prepared to make the sacrifices required by the emergency situation. In the budget message, I will advocate that the portion of defense program funding derived from taxes should be greater than at present. No one should become wealthy because of this program. For the future, we aspire to the four freedoms of humanity: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Our nation has placed its destiny in the hands, minds, and hearts of hundreds of millions of free men and women, and in their faith in freedom under the guidance of God. What is freedom? It is the supreme value of human rights. Wherever people are fighting to win or defend this right, we will give them assistance. Our strength lies in the unity of our purpose. This noble ideal knows no end but victory. (Reuter's Telegram, 7th)

### China Greatly Excited by US President's Speech, Berlin Officials Temporarily Remain Silent, Rome Expresses Annoyance

Chongqing – News today that President Roosevelt's speech to Congress yesterday has greatly excited Chongqing officials. Although the government has not issued a formal comment, non-official sources have expressed complete agreement. Locals believe that the three major points of national policy announced by President Roosevelt are not only the most practical way to alleviate the world crisis, but also the most effective means of assisting countries resisting aggression. Chinese people particularly appreciate President Roosevelt's recognition that the wars in Europe and Asia are equally important, considering it an indication that the United States has resolved to provide full assistance, without discrimination, to countries fighting a life-and-death struggle against totalitarian powers. Authorities here said that anti-aggression democratic countries should be made into great arsenals to increase their resistance. (Associated Press Telegram, 7th)

London – The highest levels here consider President Roosevelt's speech to Congress yesterday to be a challenge to German, Italian, and Japanese aggression. (Associated Press Telegram, 7th)

Washington – Yesterday, diplomatic circles in Washington predicted that if the Germans attempt to invade the British Isles next spring, President Roosevelt will eventually order American air force personnel in the air and naval forces to fight alongside the British army. American military experts generally believe that Germany will dare to launch such an invasion only after its air force has completely defeated the British air force. Diplomatic sources said that, extrapolating from President Roosevelt's message, if Britain is forced by circumstances, the United States may take military action against Germany without formally declaring war. Some also pointed out that President Roosevelt often mentioned how his predecessors, before 1941, "repeatedly engaged in undeclared wars in the West Indies, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific in order to protect American interests and the principles of peaceful commerce." At the same time, according to informal voting results, the U.S. Congress is prepared to pass the new programs that would greatly increase national defense and provide unlimited aid to Britain. (International News Service Telegram, 7th)

Berlin – Authoritative sources declared yesterday that the wording of a portion of President Roosevelt's annual report to Congress was "quite sharp," but they declined to make any comments before receiving the full text. (Associated Press Telegram, 7th)

Rome – The initial impression among political figures here regarding President Roosevelt's annual message to Congress is that the United States is virtually driving the Axis powers to declare war on the United States. Many believe that the general content of the message is nothing more than condemnation of the Axis powers' ideologies, ideals, and goals. (Associated Press Telegram, 7th)

London – President Roosevelt's address to Congress has angered the Italians. This morning, the "Italian People's Daily" published an article accusing the American president of dealing with the totalitarian countries with prejudice and theoretical hostility. Some may ask why the United States does not declare war on the Axis powers. It should be known that the American president's ambiguous and hypocritical strategy aims to make the American people, who are normally opposed to intervention, compromise. For example, the American president's hypocritical scheme will cause the Axis powers' last legal sanctions on American ships transporting materials to Britain to be regarded as unreasonable aggression. This kind of scheme cannot deceive anyone. (Reuter's Telegram, 7th)

Tokyo – When the Deputy Spokesperson of the Cabinet Information Bureau hosted foreign reporters today, and was asked about his thoughts on President Roosevelt's fireside chat, Ishii replied that there was nothing new in it. (Reuter's Telegram, 7th)

Rome – Diplomatic officials stated yesterday that Roosevelt's message to Congress was very close to a declaration of war, so henceforth the United States should be regarded as a belligerent. They believed that this declaration was very timely, because the European war is now gradually tending to develop into Southeast Europe, and this trend has a great impact on the policies of the general small countries, because they are very likely to be forced "to make important decisions."

### Italian Cabinet Issues Declaration: Vows to Uphold Axis Alliance, Determined to Fight to the End

The above declaration was issued at the same time as the Italian General Headquarters admitted the fall of Bardia. Another report from Rome stated that Italy's budget for next year will be £500 million, not including war expenses. Italy's last year's balance of payments deficit was approximately £350,000,000.

### Japan-Soviet Trade Negotiations Declared Stalled

Tokyo – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson admitted this morning that the trade talks between the Soviet Union and Japan in Moscow have been temporarily suspended, and that the negotiations for a temporary fishing agreement also temporarily encountered obstacles when the old agreement expired on December 31. However, Japan is not eager to conduct fishing agreement talks, because the previous agreement was also signed a long time after its expiration. (Reuter's Telegram, 7th)

Editorial

### A Preliminary Review of the British-Italian Confrontation

Bardia in Italian-held Libya in North Africa is a good naval port and land fortress, also an air force base. Mussolini repeatedly stated that it was as solid as a rock. Now, after 19 days of fierce fighting, it has been captured by British forces. This is the most intense battle in recent months between Germany and Italy's attempts to undermine the British Empire in Africa, the Near East, and the Middle East, and Britain's efforts to block the German-Italian advance with a retaliatory stance to strike Italy. From the beginning of the British troops' entry into Bardia on the 4th of this month, the facts have already shown that the British army has won in the initial stage of this confrontation. The fighting ability of the Italian side, in contrast, is very weak, and its current situation is extremely difficult and dangerous, and has been quite exposed.

The initial confrontation in North Africa began last summer with the Italian army's occupation of British Somaliland. At that time, the slogan of the Italian army's advance was to immediately capture the British port of Aden and completely control the eastern end of the Red Sea. However, the Italian naval base of Assab on the west bank of the Red Sea, and the port of Djibouti, seized from the French, are only fifteen miles across the sea from Aden on the opposite shore. The British fleet's blockade prevented the Italian forces from uniting. The war on this side thus presented a temporary stalemate. So Italy shifted its target to British Kenya, and also achieved considerable progress. Once, under the cover of large-scale bombing, the Italian army advanced all the way to Muyaru, Benna, and Wagir. But on one hand due to the difficulty of transportation and lack of drinking water, and also because the British army and native troops adopted large-scale guerrilla tactics to harass the Italian army, the Italian army suffered a setback. What Italy gained during this period were only some barren desert areas, which were of no military significance. In addition, the Italian army also concentrated in Asmara, Gondar, and Addis Ababa in Abyssinia, attempting to launch a large-scale offensive against British-Egyptian Sudan, but no action was ever heard. So as of now, the fall of Bardia marks the end of the East African confrontation between Britain and Italy.

In October last year, the Italian army launched an offensive against Greece in the Balkans. However, under the strong resistance of Greece and the full support of the British naval and air forces, the Blackshirt warriors were repeatedly defeated. Not only did they fail to achieve their aim of occupying the various Greek prefectures and the naval ports of Salonika, etc., but even Durazzo, their largest naval port in Albania, is now threatened by the British-Greek Allied Forces. If Durazzo were to fall, a large door would be broken through that Italy relied upon to guard the entrance to the Adriatic Sea; and the British navy would not find it difficult to penetrate deep into the Adriatic Sea and directly attack Venice. Therefore, both sides are now trying their best to win the victory in the war around Elbasan. During this period, the Italian navy also suffered serious defeats. In the Battle of Taranto, almost half of the Italian fleet was destroyed. This has added infinite difficulty and threat to the subsequent Italian reinforcement of the Albanian front.

The recent loss of Bardia by the Italian army can be called the greatest defeat in recent times. From this, it lost its main base for attacking Egypt, shattered its plan to attack the British port of Alexandria, and had no hope of occupying Port Said and controlling the Suez Canal. In this Battle of Bardia, according to the British side, a total of 60,000 Italian troops were captured, before and after. Regardless of whether the number is accurate, it is undoubtedly a large number. In addition to military losses, it also dealt a near-fatal blow to Mussolini's plan to establish an African empire. If he wants to大規模增援,再取攻勢,反敗為勝, at least in the near future, it is impossible. The Italian side claimed that the British used forces of 450,000 troops and 1,000 aircraft in this operation. We do not need to ask whether the numbers are accurate, but it is enough to get a glimpse of how grand the scale of this battle is and how important its significance is.

Examining the impact: first, it has prevented the expansion of the war, so that some nearby countries will not be drawn into the vortex for the time being. If Italy could overcome the British fleet near Aden and occupy Aden, or capture Egypt and occupy the Suez Canal area, Britain's military deployment in the Near East, Middle East, and Africa would be launched immediately, and all countries such as Yemen, Hejaz, Iraq, and Egypt would be immediately drawn in; not only that, but the entire situation in the Balkans would also change and become the property of Germany and Italy; Spain on one side and Turkey on the other have the possibility of participating in the war. Now that things are temporarily peaceful, the green Italian army suffered a defeat. Second, regarding morale, Britain has repeatedly won against Italy in the past few months since the defeat of the European mainland war, which can greatly restore the belief in victory. In Italy, since Mussolini came to power, his army, navy, and air force suffered such a setback in this first experiment, which certainly cannot be said to be unrelated to the prestige of the Fascist Party and Italy. Third, although the future of the war is always subject to change, if it develops according to the recent trend and speed, then how Italy will fight side by side with Germany to the end will quickly become a problem; and Germany's having to send heavy troops to garrison Italy is a side explanation.

Chongqing – According to Chinese sources, the Japanese troops in southern Hubei launched an offensive on the 4th of this month, attempting to strike the Chinese troops near Tongcheng in order to protect the highway traffic between Wuhan-Changsha and Wuhan-Yangxin.

### British Vanguard Reaches Outer Periphery of Tobruk, Makes Contact with Blackshirt Defenders; Remnants of Bardia Completely Cleared

London: It is reported that the vanguard of the British army has reached the Tobruk area. The British Air Force has begun a heavy strike on the Italian military and naval air base to fortify it, in preparation for the British army's attack. Last night, British bombers began bombing, causing a huge fire that could be seen from Bardia, 55 miles away. Tripoli, hundreds of miles away, was also bombed. (7th Reuters dispatch)

London: According to responsible sources here, British mechanized forces have now made contact with the outer defenses of Tobruk. After capturing Bardia, the British army quickly advanced, giving the enemy no chance to catch their breath. According to reliable sources in London, the current British victories are as follows: since December 9th of last year, the British have captured a total of 70,000 enemy soldiers and put 94,000 Italian soldiers out of action. In various battles, the British army captured and defeated a total of three regular Italian divisions, two Blackshirt divisions, one mechanized division, and one supply column. As for the large quantities of military equipment obtained by the British army, it has not yet been possible to list them in detail. It is estimated that since the fall of Bardia, General Graziani's army has lost half of its artillery, trucks, and ammunition, not to mention the loss of soldiers. (7th Reuters dispatch)

London: A Reuters special correspondent cabled from the British Army headquarters in the western desert that the Italian front line is now at Tobruk, which is about 100 miles inside the Libyan border and is the main naval and air base commanded by General Graziani. The British army has now cleared the remnants of Bardia, and there are no Italian troops between Bardia and Tobruk. British troops are patrolling back and forth. It is confirmed that Bardia has only one line of defense, while Tobruk has two lines of defense. The outer line is about 25 miles in circumference, and the inner line is about 11 miles. Regardless of the future trend of the Libyan war, Graziani must already be in a very serious position. In addition to a large number of Italian soldiers being captured, he has also lost half of the artillery, trucks, ammunition, and other war equipment of the Italian army in Libya. (7th Reuters dispatch)

British Army on the Move in Bardia: Impatient British tank drivers drove their roaring tanks out of Bardia yesterday, heading west to the major Libyan port of Tobruk for another blitzkrieg. The drivers shouted, "On to Tobruk!" Tobruk has been bombed by the British Air Force for 24 hours, and the sky is ablaze with fire, which can be seen even from Bardia, 60 miles away. Australian infantry and other British Royal infantry are currently busy clearing the Bardia battlefield. The number of Italian soldiers captured there is estimated to be around 30,000. It is believed that this number may increase to 40,000 after the "inventory" is completed. The British army has established a battlefield headquarters in the Bardia administrative office. One opinion in the headquarters is that a large number of German aircraft may rush to Tobruk to assist in its defense, but the British army is determined to occupy it before the German air force arrives. According to unofficial information last night, a British vanguard has already reached 20 miles southwest of Tobruk. It is reported that General Graziani's troops have concentrated in Tobruk. (7th International dispatch)

Italy Admits Fall of Bardia

Rome: The Italian General Headquarters communique admits that the last stronghold of Bardia fell on the evening of January 5th. The communique went on to say that the Italian army suffered heavy casualties and missing. When British aircraft bombed Tobruk, Italian anti-aircraft artillery shot down two of them. On the Albanian front, the Italian army has recovered an important position and obtained weapons and ammunition. The communique also mentioned that in the city of Tekini, on the Sudanese border, British mechanized forces were scattered by Italian artillery fire. (7th Reuters dispatch)

London: A senior British military officer, in describing the battle to capture Bardia, concluded that if it were not for General Graziani's lack of talent and vision, or if Graziani was driven by the Fascist Party to take such unwise action, the Italian army would not have blindly advanced without considering their own safety to prevent defeat. It was extremely unwise. However, it seems that Graziani was forced to take this unwise action against his better judgment. The Italian intelligence department has also failed, as it has always been wrong about the number of British troops fighting, sometimes overestimating them, sometimes completely unaware of the arrival of British troops. (7th Reuters dispatch)

Morale of Blackshirt Troops is Low

London: A Reuters military commentator said that the fall of Bardia was indeed expected, but the greatness and speed of the British victory, the large number of Italian prisoners, and the small number of British casualties were unexpected. Italy's control of Libya has now been fundamentally shaken, as has its control of Abyssinia. The poor combat quality shown by the Italian army proves that Italian soldiers have no heart for war. The fact that so many Italian soldiers surrendered makes it impossible not to believe that the lack of fighting spirit is not just a local phenomenon, but that the entire Italian army stationed in Libya or the entire Italian army lacks fighting spirit. General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, immediately took command and headed straight for Tobruk. With no other obstacles besides supplies, and with supplies now greatly increased, the British army's advance on Tobruk will not encounter any resistance until it reaches the port. Now that Bardia has fallen, it is impossible to say whether the Italian army in Tobruk will resist stubbornly. In fact, it is highly doubtful whether the Italian army in Libya is capable of continuing to mount a strong defense. Therefore, it would not be surprising to see Tobruk fall within a week.

German Aid Arrives Too Late

London: Rumors that 500 German aircraft and 10,000 German troops have gathered in various ports in southern Italy, preparing to go to Libya to reinforce, even if true, are too late. They can be regarded as empty threats. If German aircraft arrive in Libya, they will find that their airfields have been bombed and are in danger of repeated attacks. If the German side attempts to transport 10,000 troops to Libya by sea, they will all be buried at the bottom of the sea. The current British strategy may be to completely expel the Italian army from Libya and then turn to any other target. In addition to resisting the British advance, General Graziani, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army in Libya, must also send some troops to protect the Italian farmers who live along the northern coast, as the tribal peoples who have been abused by the Italians and driven out of their old homes will rise up and attack unprotected Italian homes. The position of the coastal ports and airfields of Libya is extremely important to the British Navy and Air Force. Therefore, the British army should take the occupation of these ports and airfields as its top priority, so as to regain control of the Mediterranean and ensure the smooth flow of supplies from the east. At the same time, if the British army gains a foothold on the Libyan coast, it will be able to continue to attack Italy. (7th Reuters dispatch)

Port of Tripoli Raided by Air

Cairo: The British Air Force Headquarters here recently stated that on Saturday night, British aircraft carried out a large-scale bombing of Tripoli, a major Italian port in Libya. Important targets such as power plants, customs houses, docks, and ships docked in the port were bombed. Tons of bombs were dropped, and fires broke out in the area near the power plant and in the customs buildings, which could be clearly seen from 30 miles away at sea. In addition, an oil plant was also hit by multiple incendiary and high-explosive bombs. (7th United Press dispatch)

It is reported that this squadron has been operating in the Libya area since Italy joined the war, without a moment's rest. (7th Reuters dispatch)

### Greek Army Fights Bravely in the Cold; Progress on All Fronts; Italian Regular Army on the Albanian Front Replaced by Fascist Militia

Athens: War reports say that although the Italian army in northern Albania has been reinforced by German tank units and is stubbornly defending Elba, the Greek army still attacked Elba this morning. Despite the extreme cold, with temperatures dropping to 25 degrees below freezing, the Greek army continued to advance in the cold, continuing to consolidate its new positions, gradually approaching Elba from all directions. A brief Greek communique stated, "Patrols and the Air Force are also active." However, according to unofficial claims, the Greek army has been victorious on all lines, and Italian counterattacks have been repelled. The Greek army, pressing on to Valona, has occupied several strategically important heights, and after occupying several coastal villages, has also defeated an elite Blackshirt division. In the areas of Tepe and Kilisura, the Greek army has advanced further, pressing the Italian army to retreat to Berat. More than 200 Italian soldiers were captured, including five officers. The most important victory was in the northeast, where the Greek army adopted guerrilla tactics, gradually descending the Hugerbi Valley, seizing important Italian positions, and pressing the Italian front line to retreat north to Librazhd, a deeply entrenched Italian base where German and Italian forces plan to mount a second defense. (7th International News Agency dispatch)

London: According to a Free French News Agency correspondent in Istanbul, reports that the Italian regular army on the Albanian front is now being replaced by Fascist militia have been confirmed. It is reported that they are being transported by German Junkers transport aircraft. Fascist militia leader Starace inspected the Blackshirt stormtroopers in Albania on December 28 and 29. (7th Reuters dispatch)

Sofia: The Zora newspaper here published an obituary editorial yesterday, saying that Germany's participation in the Italian-Greek war will be brought about by the Greek capture of Valona. The newspaper pointed out that if Valona falls into the hands of the Greek army, the passage to the Adriatic Sea will be opened, and the British fleet can then threaten Vienna and Munich. If Britain gains control of the Adriatic Sea, it can not only bomb the interior of the sea, but also penetrate and bomb Vienna and Munich, because Britain can use aircraft carriers and Valona as air bases. Military observers here also said that they believe that the great floods in southeastern Bulgaria may make large-scale military operations in the area impossible. The great floods may prevent the activities of Turkish troops along the border. The Turkish army there, in view of the ever-changing situation in the Balkans, has long been on the alert, ready to respond to any changes. (7th United Press dispatch)

### Balkan Situation Changing; Bulgaria Will Become a German Vassal; Bulgaria Denies German Ultimatum Demanding Right of Way; It is Said that Germany and the Soviet Union Have Reached an Understanding

Yugoslav Capital: Senior officials told United Press last night that there is no doubt that Germany demanded to occupy Bulgaria at the end of last week and that Bulgaria has already succumbed. It is understood that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop submitted the request to Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov last Saturday. Well-informed circles say that the first step may be that Bulgaria invites Germany to send military advisers, and then the situation will be the same as in Romania. Well-informed observers say that the first step may begin tomorrow, the day after the Greek Orthodox Christmas. (7th United Press dispatch)

Bulgarian Capital: Rumors are circulating that German troops will occupy Bulgaria, but the country is now extremely peaceful. Senior Bulgarian officials strongly deny that Filov has met with Ribbentrop, or that Bulgaria has received a German ultimatum or request from any source. The people are celebrating the Greek Orthodox Christmas today. A United Press correspondent in Berlin reported that well-informed circles told him that the news circulating in the Yugoslav capital that Germany is preparing to enter Bulgaria tomorrow and peacefully occupy it is "too absurd, we don't need to comment."

Hungarian Capital: Just as people are generally worried that the German blitzkrieg will pass through the Balkans and reach Greece, news from the Southern capital yesterday said that Germany and the Soviet Union have already signed a secret agreement, allowing German troops to pass through Bulgaria, but diplomatic circles believe that this news should be viewed with absolute reservations. The general public believes that this news was created by the German side. News circulating outside that Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov has accepted the ultimatum from Nazi troops to allow them passage has been formally and solemnly denied by the Bulgarian Embassy here. (According to news from the International News Agency in London, Soviet circles in London admit that the news from the Balkans is indeed disturbing, but say that this news does not match their recent news from Moscow, because Soviet circles in London claim that, according to recent news from Moscow, the Soviet Union is still strongly opposed to Germany's military use of Bulgarian territory, regardless of whether it can obtain Bulgaria's consent). However, news from the Southern capital yesterday strongly stated that the Soviet Union has agreed to German troops' passage with reservations, so that Germany will agree to support the Soviet Union's demands on Finland and Moldova in exchange. (7th International News Agency dispatch)

### Bulgarian Cabinet to be Reorganized; Pro-German Faction to be Prime Minister

Romanian Capital: The Romanian "Current News" today telegraphed from the Bulgarian capital that Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov may submit his resignation due to ill health, so the Bulgarian cabinet will be reorganized. It is said that the current Minister of Agriculture, Bagrianov, is a close friend of the Axis countries, so he is expected to become Prime Minister. If Bagrianov's succession as Prime Minister can become a reality, then the current Ambassador to Germany, Draganov, will be appointed as Foreign Minister. (7th Haitian News dispatch)

### Philippine New Market Law; Affects Overseas Chinese; China Has Filed a Protest

Manila: Philippine President Quezon gave a speech more than a year ago expressing his hope that the retail business should be in the hands of Filipinos.

The office of the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines has also warned that the U.S. State Department will oppose certain provisions of the law due to Sino-American relations. However, the Manila City Government seems determined to approve the law, and it may be submitted to the Presidential Palace for final approval.

### British Officer's Diary from the Western Front

This is the diary of British officer Captain Glebel fighting on the Western Front. The original text was published in the American "Saturday Evening Post." Here is a translation:

May 10, 1940: Around 4:30, I was awakened by anti-aircraft fire. At first, I didn't pay attention. But by 5:15, I felt that the artillery fire was extremely fierce, with a rumbling sound that never stopped, and I heard the rattling sound of airplanes circling overhead. I got out of bed and went to the window to look. At that time, dawn had just broken, and the sky was cloudless. I saw five enemy planes, arranged in a diamond formation, with anti-aircraft shells exploding around them, and the smoke obscured the sky. Soon, Allied fighter planes flew in, with the sound of machine guns rattling, and other planes followed. After the planes flew out of sight, the sound of artillery also subsided.

I went back to bed and slept until 7:00 when Garrison knocked on the door of Osbourough's room next door, and I was awakened again. Osbourough immediately entered my room and reported that the war had begun.

Our barracks were a small, rented house, quite comfortable. Osbourough took a bath first, ate breakfast quickly, and drove to headquarters. I got out of bed leisurely, ate breakfast, and sorted out documents. An hour later, I arrived at the office and confirmed that the Germans had opened up to Angers. The Anglo-French Allied forces had also entered Belgium. Many of our airfields had been bombed, but the losses were minimal. Five German bombers were shot down, and five of our planes were destroyed on the ground, but there were no casualties. It was heartbreaking that the planes were destroyed before they took off. The communication line of the Malley Air Force Detachment Headquarters was damaged by the bombing and took one or two hours to repair.

The town market was thriving, with flowers in full bloom, competing in beauty. The old woman who delivered cheese still arrived on time, without mentioning a word about the morning's events.

At 9:30, news was received that enemy paratroopers had landed in Gravenmacht and Limishi.

On the road from Luxembourg to Aix-la-Chapelle, troops were moving for ten miles. Everywhere I saw people with smiles on their faces.

At 10:00, I went to the station to look for a box of Amontillado wine, but I didn't find it. I also managed to settle Colonel O'Dowdell's coachman, Hogen, and his batman, Spier. At 10:30, I returned to headquarters and learned that the war had begun.

Air Force Detachment Liaison Officer Langston had just returned.

On the way, he encountered two German bombers circling overhead, only forty feet high. One of them was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and the pilots were captured.

It was reported that the Belgian and Dutch armies had risen up to resist, and the French army had also crossed the Belgian border.

At 10:35, Air Force Commander Barratt arrived with a pipe in his mouth, a smiling face, and staff members.

Although the Air Force Detachment had dispatched planes this morning for reconnaissance, there was still no news reported.

At this time, a report was suddenly received that forty enemy troop transport planes had landed in The Hague.

The General Headquarters seemed unprepared. There were quite a few fake officers and soldiers. Information came one after another, with hardly a second of free time. Now the facts have come. But there was no news about our troops or planes, no telegrams, no information, and no telephones.

The air raid siren was installed on the roof of the post office, almost directly opposite our barracks. The strange sound of the siren made people tremble. Personally, I felt that the local people were agitated more by the psychological effect of the air raid siren than by the actual bombing. This morning, many civilians were killed and injured on the highway near the Tranquesney railway, which was a tragedy.

May 12, 9:00 PM: There is nothing to record today. In fact, I haven't written a word yet. I was on duty last night, so I don't have the energy to write in my diary today.

News came that all the drivers of our Air Force Task Force were willing to be suicide squads. Four were selected, and the bridges in the town of Maastricht, which had not been destroyed, were completely destroyed. However, although they had accomplished their ambitions, it is feared that they had all died for their country. They gave the Allied forces valuable time to calmly defend the predetermined line on the Dir River, east of Beijing and Brussels.

From the Swiss border to the North Sea, the war has been unfolding on a large scale. The enemy's feinting attacks make it difficult to distinguish between the real and the unreal. The situation in the Netherlands is particularly bewildering, making it unpredictable. Contradictory news came one after another. The general impression was that the Germans had failed to break through the Allied line at one stroke as they had expected. Although Maastricht was broken through by the enemy, it was already expected.

A British pilot was shot down by the enemy this morning between Tongeren and Tirlemont. He escaped for a while and met several Belgian infantrymen. They mistook a team of German tanks for a Belgian tank team and went forward to meet them, only to be shot back by a burst of bullets.

They all escaped into a forest. In the forest, they found several civilian corpses. The pilot took off the clothes of one of the corpses, took off his uniform, disguised himself as a Belgian farmer, and crossed the German line. Half an hour later, he hitched a ride on a Belgian car and found his way to this headquarters. Now he is going to the Fifth Air Force Detachment to return to his unit. I won't write any more tonight. I must get some sleep.

May 13: This morning, the war situation seems quite stable, but it is gradually unfolding. Only the left wing of the French Seventh Army is threatened by the German mechanized forces. The enemy mechanized forces are passing through Breda in dense formation, stretching for twelve miles. The bomber command saw this as a good target and wanted to show its skills. I hope that the reinforcements requested by the French will soon be effective.

For four days, the Germans have never bombed the Anglo-French forces entering Belgium, which is quite strange. Our advance seems to be what the Germans wanted. Does the French General Headquarters not know the danger of encountering war and should try to avoid it?

May 14: The serious news of the fall of Sedan came. Sedan is located on the banks of the Meuse River. The crossing at Dinant, about fifteen miles south of Namur, has been occupied. I was on the night shift, and at midnight I suddenly received news that the situation in Sedan had deteriorated. The enemy had occupied a salient 15 kilometers long and 10 kilometers deep. Senior officers held an emergency meeting. On the British side, there was Air Force Commander Barratt. On the French side, there were General Dasti, General Yeffrie, Corps Commander General Billotte, and General Bingzhi's liaison officer D'Arno, and Air Force Chief of Staff General Feyumin's liaison officer Bessanditon. The meeting was tragic and moving. Most of the French officers were heartbroken and in tears, and because the French army retreated from its fortified position without resistance, it was ashamed and embarrassed, even crying out loud. This kind of thing is really too unimaginable!

According to D'Arno, the French army has 30 fighter jets in the Sedan area. Heavy artillery is bombarding the enemy with all its strength. The infantry is scheduled to launch a counterattack at 11:00, led by tanks. The morale of the French army is high, and it hopes to defeat the Germans in one fell swoop.

2:15 PM: The French counterattack in the Sedan area has been delayed by 30 minutes. This is a fatal pause. At the same time, the Germans continued to exert their strength and have extended the breakthrough gap by three miles to the left and right wings, and three miles deeper into the wilderness. The French artillery has all been lost. (To be continued)

### The Tri-Educational Strike Resolved Satisfactorily Yesterday

Higher Salaries to be Increased Next Semester; Classes Resume Today

The faculty and staff of the San Yu Elementary and Middle School at No. 15, Lane 920, Xin Kai Road, requested higher salaries from the school, but did not receive a satisfactory response, leading to an unfortunate strike. This created an unprecedented event in the isolated education sector. Educational figures across the city were paying close attention to the developments of this matter, and educational authorities, in particular, given their responsibilities, mediated with the utmost speed and sincerity. The San Yu School Board also made every effort to assist. Because both the faculty and the school authorities were deeply aware of the difficulties of the time, understood each other, were open and honest, and treated each other with sincerity, this crisis was resolved smoothly in the shortest possible time. Our reporter learned the details as follows: The conditions put forward by the faculty and staff yesterday were divided into three items. It is understood that the conditions they raised were very simple and not entirely as reported. They only requested a 30% salary increase starting next semester. Because the school was unable to respond quickly, it led to the unfortunate strike. Educational authorities and school board members immediately traveled day and night to mediate. Because both sides were able to consider the overall situation, after negotiations, the school decided to increase the salaries of all faculty and staff by 27% across the board starting next semester, which is 90% of the original request of the faculty and staff.

### Food: Despite the Large Arrival of Foreign Rice in Shanghai, Rice Merchants Remain Unshaken and Refuse to Sell Stockpiled Goods, Unwilling to Order More Foreign Rice, Are They Intending to Starve the People of Shanghai?

Yesterday's rice market continued to be in a stalemate. The price of foreign rice continued to soar due to various restrictions, exceeding the border price. Under the close supervision of the authorities, there was little possibility of rising, but speculators' hopes remained strong, unwilling to sell off. They would rather let the stockpiled rice rot and decay than comply with the deadline to release it for the benefit of the people. Such a wolfish heart and insatiable greed is also due to the fact that the authorities have not yet taken legal action against hoarders. The rice market has not been systematically and purposefully rectified, so the ferocity is increasing, unwilling to sell the goods on hand, so there are no goods on the market for buyers to buy. Also, seeing that border crossing transactions were punished with imprisonment, they were also slightly cautious, unwilling to take hasty actions and buy in excess of the limit, Ningyuan sat tight, fortunately, each rice store has stocks, not worried about no goods on the market, so the market on the market, the transaction is sparse, like a dead market, the opening spot, only 79 yuan of Haiphong red rice, and 78 yuan of sub to 76 yuan 3 jiao of Mi Lv, and sharp crushed, opening 76 yuan sub to Mi Qi 68 yuan, other Saigon one or two fire twist small twist and other goods, the market is not out of style, secretly afraid of still doing its illegal trading, only the road of each goods fell unanimously, Gai because the price is in line, importers are very hard to sell in the market, January small twist has opened 86 yuan, yesterday only 84 yuan to sell still no takers, and Saigon No. 1 January has opened 96 yuan, yesterday Changyi (another draft is Heyi Foreign Firm) threw two batches, initially 95 yuan, afternoon has reduced to 94 yuan, the transaction only a few hundred tons, Gai afraid of more orders will prevent its stockpiling and hoarding, also, the price is two yuan higher than the previous market, the original packaging returned to the profit floating households competing to seek out, the market also stepped on a small number of jiao and one or two yuan different, December 9 small twist only 931 yuan 2 jiao, January 16 loading initially 84 yuan half, followed by 84 yuan 3 jiao to 84 yuan, and the entrants still do not see food, the transaction only 400 tons, enough to see that there are many orders for foreign rice, and rice merchants are unwilling to order, especially to see its deliberate manipulation, harming the people's food, is undeniable.

Although the arrival of thick and thin japonica and other national rice is continuous and not much, but because foreign rice is soft, the sales field has turned inferior, and the seller's willingness to sell has become more relaxed, so it forms a situation of no honor or disgrace, such as Kunshan husk of white japonica is still open about 106 yuan, green horn husk of thin rice 101 yuan to 100 yuan.

The glutinous rice market is said to be in a sluggish state, and the road to go is even weaker, so although the seller voluntarily devalued the price and sought to sell, it is still difficult to attract a large stomach, the result of the selling price fell short by one yuan, and the number of transactions in the city is still mostly no more than three or four white packages, a total of Yi澳白元 open 91 yuan, Hong Kong Baiyuan 82 yuan, sub to yellow 78 yuan out of zero only.

Foreign rice to Shanghai is very surge-like, yesterday Jardine Matheson Yuyuan wheeled to the port, shipped from Hong Kong 18,377 packages, docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading, and decided to China Postal Shipping Company Zhimanaike shipped from Hong Kong 1,700 tons (number of packages unknown) has arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 2nd of this month and docked at Peidong Blue Smoke Stack Wharf for unloading, this shipment of foreign rice, the past few days ago missed report, Huarun Foreign Firm manager of the French lost Albert Sarrant, directly loaded from Saigon 2,450 tons of corn, etc. has been recorded in the previous newspaper, now known that the wheel has been imported at 4:45 pm yesterday, about 7 o'clock can arrive at the scheduled Hongkou Shuntai docking, today began to unload, (Z祖)

### Foreign Flour Falls as Fixed Arrivals Cease

### Securities Public Bonds Continue to Rise New Highs Appear Again Big Rallies with Small Corrections

Public bond gray market prices yesterday, on the back of continuous gains in recent days, saw new highs across the board in the morning. Category A bonds broke through 8 yuan, and Category C bonds broke through 7 yuan. Although Category C bonds still hit a new high of 7.675 yuan in the afternoon, the market then saw a large number of profit-takers emerge, leading to a big rally followed by a small correction. This movement broke the 8-yuan mark for Category A bonds, and Category C bonds retreated to 7 yuan. However, the final results were still higher than the previous day. The overall trend remains that rises are easier than falls, but a correction is inevitable. It is noted that Yuxing and Xinfu were the biggest buyers this time, suggesting they must have considerable underlying strength. The lack of available bonds in the market also deterred short sellers. The future may see a slight correction. Yesterday's trading was even more vigorous, with Yuxing and Xinfu constantly buying throughout the morning and afternoon, while Shenchang, Wuyuan, and Yizhong constantly selling, creating a fairly balanced situation. Dingkang, Lianhe, and Xianjin bought first and sold later. Other buyers included Renchang, Datong, and Delong in the morning, and Yitai, Wantai, Tongkang, and Jiufeng in the afternoon. Sellers were more widespread, mostly profit-takers and short sellers. Dahua, Lianyi, Runli, Renfeng, and Hu Heji sold off in the morning. Those who sold in the afternoon included Tongshun, Lemao, Yichang, Xiekang, and Nos. 11, 25, and 41, all of whom divested substantial amounts. Therefore, although the market price was pushed up by Xinfu and Yuxing, it fell back very quickly afterward. The final result was still a rise of 5 fen to 6 jiao and 5 fen, with particularly high trading volume totaling about 3.5 million yuan. The 96 bonds have disappeared without a trace. A concise table is listed below:

In stock trading, 15 shares of Dasheng Third Factory were traded at a price of 33.1 yuan.

The Public Industry Stock Exchange's potential remains good. Although profit-taking by bulls continued throughout the day, buyers occasionally stepped in to maintain the market. Trading in famous stocks was not as heavy as in previous days. Some stagnant stocks were surprisingly popular. For example, Zhongying shares rose to a new high of 9.3 yuan, and Zilaihuo shares were also traded at 19.4 yuan. Among the famous stocks, Shanghai Banking Corporation and Xiangtai Timber were the most active, but both saw large-scale selling, with the former at 41 yuan and the latter at 5.7 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton Optimism among Traders Cotton Yarn Downtrend Stabilizes

The yarn market, which experienced a sharp drop the previous day, entered a consolidation phase at the opening yesterday morning. However, actual consumption was sluggish due to the approaching end of the year, and purchasing by various guilds was slow. At the same time, the exchange rate was calm and showing signs of lengthening, and the gold guild was inclined to sell off, leading to a weak market sentiment. However, some traders were not pessimistic, so the market appeared hesitant. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,345 yuan, and the low price was 1,334 yuan, but it closed at 1,348 yuan. In the afternoon gray market, due to the exchange rate tightening and the price of gold rising sharply, it initially traded at 1,350 yuan, then at 1,355 yuan. Today, 15 bales of cotton yarn are being shipped to Xiamen, and 910 bales are being shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened in the morning, and because the price of gold rose and then contracted the previous afternoon, market sentiment was average. Most speculators were thinking of shorting. The opening price was 5,341 yuan. With this opening, there were quite a few buyers, and it rebounded to 1,346 yuan. It fluctuated for a long time outside of 1,340 yuan. It was then reported that the exchange rate had stabilized and the price of gold was slightly weak, human sentiment softened, and actual demand was sluggish. Sellers and leveraged long positions were unloading, gradually falling to 1,334 yuan. After 11 a.m., short covering pushed it back up to 1,342 yuan. It is noted that the total trading volume in half a day was 6,170 bales, and the price of 20-count Double Horse was flat. The amount bought by each guild is listed below:

### Double Horse Yarn Why the Sudden Rises and Falls

The recent yarn market, after discovering a new high, quickly retreated. The details of what happened are briefly reported below:

(1) From the perspective of foreign customers, in early December of last year, they suddenly started dragging in goods, anticipating the exchange rate would contract. This later materialized, and the price of gold soared. As a result, Double Horse followed suit, rising to a peak price of 1,435 yuan on December 27, a jump of 228 yuan compared to the low of 1,207 yuan at the beginning of the month. However, most of the market shifted its goal to seeing further price increases. Unexpectedly, those who had profited took the opportunity to exit, so after the new year, the local exchange rate became calm and showed signs of lengthening. As a result, general leveraged accounts, recognizing the unfavorable environment, decisively closed out their positions, easing the pressure, and a counter-reaction began suddenly. The market price plunged by a substantial 40 to 50 yuan. Yesterday morning, the lowest price was 1,334 yuan, a drop of 101 yuan from the high. Therefore, in the afternoon, as the price of gold rose slightly, speculators became active again, and the trend reversed upward.

(2) According to market sources, actual sales in Hong Kong are particularly sluggish. Apart from 32-count single yarn being more palatable, other types of yarn have little appeal. Therefore, Double Horse yarn is the object of speculation by the masses, and the price difference with other miscellaneous brands of yarn is too large. The price of 20-count Great Girl yarn is within 1,100 yuan, and the price of 20-count Double Globe yarn is 1,140 yuan. Given this varying degree of high and low prices, some believe that it is more prudent to buy low-priced goods than to buy Double Horse.

(3) Because sales of Double Horse yarn spot goods from foreign warehouses are not picking up, they need to be stored in warehouses, requiring insurance, rent, and other miscellaneous fees, and speculators are not welcoming them. For this reason, the warehouse receipt price for Double Horse is tens of yuan cheaper. Given the above situation, most are giving up on Double Horse. Therefore, with a counter-reaction, there was a sudden drop of over 100 yuan.

(4) The fundamental issue cannot be separated from actual consumption. If sales are widespread, the upward momentum will naturally be consolidated. Otherwise, artificial manipulation, with A making a profit and reselling to B, and so on through several transactions, may ultimately be satisfactory, but the current situation relies solely on rumors to expand and contract. In short, this market rose before the event, so it has the phenomenon of falling after the event. (Shan)

### Cotton Mills' Demand is Weak

The current cotton situation lacks any excitement. This is because the exchange rate is stable, and orders for Indian cotton are arriving in Shanghai one after another, so market sentiment is flat. However, trading among traders is showing slight improvement, but demand from mills remains weak.

In other news, the market price of foreign cotton in the New York cotton market initially fell due to selling by speculators. Subsequently, it rose because of increased domestic consumption of raw cotton figures and the rise in Wall Street stocks. As a result, the closing price rose compared to the previous day. Yesterday, India, including forecasts, fell by two rupees.

Trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been extraordinarily quiet in recent days. All parties are uninterested. Japanese manufacturers have a stronger desire to purchase, but only do scattered trading. Traders remain in a wait-and-see attitude.

### Piece Goods Market Optimism Returns

The piece goods market yesterday was tending toward the flat and weak, closing slightly firm. Large traders absorbed amounts and held them firmly, while small traders transacted slightly at cheaper prices. Sales to customers also lacked wholesale transactions. The selling prices of some coarse, fine, and twill cloths fell by 1 to 2.5 jiao per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth was stable. Market sentiment for the future unanimously turned firmer. The total transaction volume of various cloths in this street was more than 500 pieces. The Zhejiang-Fujian gang purchased more than 100 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, poplin, etc. The Guangdong-Hong Kong gang purchased more than 100 pieces of khaki, colored cloth, and various cloths, etc. Overseas, Singapore, Little Luzon, and other places purchased more than 5,000 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth.

East cloth first fell and then rose, and the market turned bullish. White goods, led by fine cloth, fell step by step in the morning, with the lowest price falling to 40.01 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the sharp rise in yarn prices in the exchange, small traders rushed to take delivery, pushing prices up round by round. The closing price was 41.4 yuan, up 5 jiao per piece. Other miscellaneous brands of fine cloth also uniformly rose in price. The new warehouse receipt for Four Gentlemen's Serge rose to 1.1925 yuan, while the old warehouse receipt widened the gap, only at 1.1375 yuan.

Piece goods exports on the 8th: 1,420 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, 34 pieces shipped to Xiamen, and 400 pieces shipped to Tianjin.

### Sugar Market Sugar Prices Decline More Severely

The sugar market trend yesterday was weak and market sentiment was very soft, so the downtrend intensified. The guild's clearing price for spot goods of 24-grade white was 79 yuan for local warehouses and 78.5 to 78 yuan for foreign warehouses, down 1.6 yuan. Dutch cotton white BS mark was initially 78.2 yuan, then 78 yuan, and then 77.5 yuan, down 7 jiao. Dutch red spot goods were 66.6 to 66.2 jiao. The 15th of January delivery was 67 to 66.3 jiao, down 1 yuan. Taikoo Caster White B mark was 78.8 to 78.5 jiao, then 78 yuan, down 1 yuan. DY mark was 77.5 to 77.2 jiao, down 8 jiao. HX mark was 77.3 to 76.8 jiao, down 7 jiao. H mark red was 64 yuan, and old goods were 63.8 jiao, with a smaller decline. The factory's No. 1 ice was 100 yuan, and Jingming ice was 101 yuan, down 2 yuan.

### Dried and Preserved Goods Golden Needles and Raw Peanuts are Both Tight

The golden needle vegetable market continued to tighten yesterday. The top grade goods were opened for sale again at a price of 125 yuan, up 5 yuan. The rest also tightened accordingly.

Raw peanuts, such as those from Weihaiwei, were restricted due to local controls and could not be shipped out, so there was a shortage of goods arriving, and the market trend tightened. Yesterday, Qingdao Renyang Zhuang was 61.5 yuan, general goods were 58 yuan, Yangzhou Ren was 53 yuan, Guzhen Ren had recently arrived and was being opened for inspection, about 52 yuan, and Xuzhou peanuts were 41 yuan.

### Silk and Tea The Silk Market Suddenly Sees Prosperity

The local silk market, affected by the sudden rise in silk prices, swept away the dull atmosphere and presented a prosperous scene. In the past two days, various export firms have had considerable interest. Statistics for the full day's transactions are estimated at around 250 bales.

### Sundries Cigarette Market Consolidates Slightly

The cigarette market situation had a rather strong upward trend within the year. In recent days, the red trend has gradually fallen. Because the financial situation is trending toward balance and human sentiment is stable, those holding goods are selling off to take profits, and buyers are instead weak. Also, factories are distributing more goods, so when the market opened for sale yesterday, the downtrend was very strong. For example, Old Knife Brand opened at 925 yuan, and Great Britain Brand opened at 1,325 yuan, about 50 yuan less than the year's peak. Little Fairy was 658 yuan, Five Hua Brand was 660 yuan, Pin Hai Brand was 870 yuan, and Ten-Branch Qianmen Brand was 327 yuan per 10,000. The China National Cigarette Company's Merry Brand Golden Mouse Brand followed the consolidation and added more than 10 yuan. (Kun)

### Metals Steel Bars and Iron Billets Both See High Prices

Bamboo Joint Steel Bars: Since the new year, they have been particularly lively because the Jiangzhe inland river gangs have been embellishing things, and the local construction gangs also have the need to absorb. Added to this is that the situation in the Pacific is becoming more tense, and the source is limited, so inventory is not abundant. Therefore, people's hearts are proud, and opening prices are showing. For example, three- and four-point patterns must open at 1,300 yuan per ton, and five-point to one-inch coarse goods are also sold at 1,230 to 1,240 yuan per ton, each higher than before by about 20 to 30 yuan.

Black Iron Billets: Quite a few of the Iron Billet transactions were absorbed by the thermos factory on this street yesterday and the day before. The small sales of merchants from North Road and local merchants are also good. Therefore, the market situation is fairly good, and people in the industry are still optimistic. The market is also trending higher step by step. Yesterday, 2,000-pound original bundled goods were sold at 1,200 yuan to 1,300 yuan per piece.

### Extra Tax Case of Municipal Council Various Parties Hope for Cautious Discussion Citizens' Livelihoods are Increasingly Difficult to Bear Extra Tax and Reduced Administration Should Be Carried Out Simultaneously

The Municipal Council's proposed increase of 40% in tax revenue to make up for its 20 million yuan deficit has aroused opposition from the majority of Chinese and foreigners. With residents already struggling to cope with daily necessities such as food and fuel, they are now burdened by an increase in rent. The difficulties of life will become even more unimaginable. A fierce dispute is bound to erupt at the Special Ratepayers' Meeting on the 23rd, which is to be expected.

About 20 Million Yuan in Extra Taxes

The Municipal Council's current tax revenue is 14,146,500 yuan in land rent and 21,266,000 yuan in house tax, plus 1,380,000 yuan in special taxes outside the concession. Now, with an increase of 40%, land rent can generate an additional 5,658,600 yuan, house tax can generate an additional 8,506,000 yuan, and special taxes outside the concession can generate an additional 552,000 yuan, totaling about 14,715,000 yuan. Adding the increase in various miscellaneous taxes, it will not be less than about 6 million yuan. This increase in revenue would be sufficient to make up for the 20 million yuan deficit.

Citizens' Economies Cannot Bear the Burden

However, disregarding the difficulties of the citizens and rashly taking this approach of "draining the pond to catch the fish" may make it difficult to maintain security in the concession in the future. Therefore, the general public hopes that the Special Ratepayers' Meeting will carefully discuss this tax increase, taking into account the burden on the citizens and ensuring social security. Rather than increasing taxes, it would be better to reduce administration or replace Westerners with Chinese to reduce remittances and save money. Even if there is a need for an increase, it is necessary to consider whether the general public has the ability to bear it.

Location of Meeting Has Been Selected

According to a notice issued by the Municipal Council yesterday, the Special Ratepayers' Meeting to be held at 2:30 p.m. on the 23rd of this month will take place at the public grandstand of the Race Club at 305 Jing'an Temple Road. The rules of procedure for the meeting are the same as those for the previous meeting. Taxpayers in need can obtain them from the Secretariat of the Municipal Council.

### Labor Unrest Is Raging and Needs to Be Resolved

The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that the labor unrest in Shanghai today (7th) not only has not ended, but new labor disputes have arisen and continue to disrupt the normal situation in the city. Only the workers at the Xujiahui Orphanage, who demanded improved compensation, reached a satisfactory settlement with the employer today. This is the first dispute resolved this year. Along the Suzhou River,

Stevedores

Approximately six hundred people, who demanded a wage increase but were unsuccessful, are still on strike this morning. It is reported that although these stevedores are short-term workers, they have a union organization, so they can act in unison. Also,

Silver Automobile

Company drivers have submitted a request for increased wages and rice subsidies and asked the company to respond immediately. Many believe that if a proper solution is not reached, it may lead to a slowdown in work. Also,

The Commercial Press

1,800 employees learned today that their request for improved treatment has been rejected by the Hong Kong headquarters. It seems difficult to quickly resolve the labor unrest. Also,

The French-language "Daily News"

More than 40 employees were promised a rice subsidy of 10 yuan by the company in October of last year, and it was promised that the salary would be appropriately increased when the price of rice reached 80 yuan, and that additional subsidies would be given until the end of November. The price of rice far exceeded 80 yuan, but the company did not fulfill the previous promise. Instead, it drove the employees out of the company and hired White Russians and a small number of new workers to carry out the work. It intends to dismiss all the employees. All attempts at mediation have been rejected. It has been more than three weeks. The employees are deeply oppressed and appeal to society to uphold justice.

### Excessive Profits Tax Extension of Filing Deadline

Tax Collection Office Explains Regulations

Regarding the filing deadline for excessive profits tax and the inability of taxpayers to request a review of cases determined directly, the various income tax offices recently received the following explanations from the Tax Collection Office: (1) Article 11 of the amended Extraordinary Period Excessive Profits Tax Regulations states: "If the taxpayer fails to report the profit amount within the specified period, the competent tax collection agency may conduct an investigation and determine the tax payable, and order payment. The taxpayer may not request a review of the aforementioned decision." The specified period refers to the filing period stipulated in Article 6 of these Regulations, "If calculated according to the business year, the taxpayer shall report the profit amount to the competent tax collection agency within one month from the date of settlement." (2) Article 6 of the Implementing Rules states: "If the profit of a profit-making enterprise is settled annually and cannot be declared within one month after the end of the year, an extension shall be granted." This article is a relief provision and shall only be applied after the taxpayer submits a report to the competent tax collection agency to verify that it is indeed impossible to settle and declare within one month after the end of the year. Otherwise, the provisions of Article 11 of the Regulations shall still be followed.

### Beggars Will Disappear Within Ten Years

Beggar Shelter Plan

Maurice, a brigadier of the Salvation Army who manages the beggar shelter, told reporters yesterday that the beggar shelter plan will ensure that residents of Shanghai will no longer encounter beggars on the streets within ten years. Since the opening of the shelter, about 300 beggars have stayed in it, and there are still more than 1,200 vacancies. At a rate of 50 people admitted per day, it is expected to be full by the beginning of next month. In addition to providing food, clothing, and shelter, the shelter also teaches beggars handicrafts to enable them to be self-reliant. Children account for about 25% of the beggars and will also be educated. A school for beggar children is currently under construction. For beggars who are sick or addicted to drugs, the Salvation Army will hire full-time doctors to treat them or help them quit drugs. Beggars from other provinces stranded in Shanghai will be sent back to their places of origin after they have stayed in the shelter for a certain period of time. Maurice pointed out that the beggar shelter is not only a place to avoid hunger and keep warm, but also a place to punish the greedy and lazy. Beggars who are kept in the shelter are assigned a fixed job every day and are never allowed to eat their fill without doing anything.

### Municipal Council Scheduled to Hold Board Meeting Today

At 4:30 p.m. today, the Municipal Council will hold a regular board meeting in the Municipal Council's General Office conference room to discuss various reports submitted by the council's various subcommittees and other routine cases.

### Spring Gift Military Aid Movement Citizens Responding Unanimously Upholding Past Spirit and Fulfilling National Duty Thrift Movement Committee Urges Participation

Since the National Comforting General Association launched the Spring Gift Military Aid Movement last year, it has been promoted uniformly throughout the country. The people of this city, although limited by the environment, do not dare to lag behind in patriotism and have also responded enthusiastically, achieving considerable results. The City's Thrift Movement Committee, in order to continue to encourage morale, make persistent efforts, and complete the great task, as the Spring Festival is approaching in an instant, especially wrote an article yesterday urging people from all walks of life to uphold the spirit of the past and work hard to promote it. The original text reads roughly: "It has been investigated that the abolished lunar Spring Festival will arrive in an instant. At this time, there is much unnecessary consumption in general society. In times of prosperity, it is okay to make some embellishments, but in this extraordinary period, when the life and death of the nation and the country are at stake, every citizen has the heavy responsibility of reversing the tide and restoring the country. Therefore, donating to the Spring Gift Military Aid is the minimum national duty of our compatriots in the rear. In view of this, the Committee has already strictly ordered its subordinate organizations to uniformly promote it in order to save unnecessary consumption, transfer the object of gifts, strengthen the anti-Japanese construction mood, and complete the great cause. However, this matter is significant and requires the strength of the masses to be effective. It is hoped that enthusiastic compatriots from all walks of life will respond enthusiastically and work hard to promote it so as to obtain satisfactory results. The future is deeply promising."

### Public Granary Organization Already Agreed Upon; Secret Investigation of Warehouses Hoarding Rice; Rice Market Stagnant, Hoarders Cling to Spot Goods; Yesterday Over 30,000 People Sold Rice at Government-Subsidized Prices

The Shanghai Food Rice Public Granary Management Committee held its first meeting yesterday (7th) afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting hall. The attending committee members included Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jiyi, Ye Fuxiao, Wang Yuqing, Lu Shuchen, Ze Minmin, Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, He Dekui, and nine others. Those present included the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Food Committee, Marshall, and Secretary A. Connor, as well as the chairman of the French Municipal Council Food Committee, Du Pei, and Secretary Qi Bai. On the spot, Committee Member He Dekui was unanimously elected as chairman, and Committee Member Xu Jiyi as vice chairman. The discussion of various proposals was as follows:

Public Granary Committee Proposals

(1) Regarding the proposal to determine the name of the committee, it was decided to name it the "Shanghai Food Rice Public Granary Management Committee," abbreviated as the "Shanghai Public Granary Committee," with the purpose of (1) storing rice for famine relief and (2) regulating the rice market. (2) Regarding whether warehouse affairs should be handled in groups, it was decided to establish the following groups to be responsible for warehouse affairs: (1) Purchasing Group, (2) Storage Group, (3) Sales Group, (4) Transportation Group. (3) Regarding the selection of committee members for each group, it was decided to appoint the following committee members: (1) Purchasing Group: Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yuqing, Chen Ziyi; (2) Storage Group: Ye Fuxiao, Lu Shuchen, Zhang Zemin; (3) Sales Group: Xu Jiyi, Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang; (4) Transportation Group: Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yuqing, Zhu Zixiang. (4) Regarding the appointment of a treasurer, it was decided to hire accountant Xi Yushu as the warehouse treasurer. (5) Regarding the additional hiring of a Chinese accountant to join the audit, it was decided to hire accountant Xu Yongzuo to jointly audit with foreign accountant Thomson. (6) Regarding how each industry should pay the determined quantity, it was decided that each industry should pay 50% of the determined quantity before the 15th of this month, either in cash or in kind. If paying in cash, the standard price is 85 yuan per half bag. If paying in rice, the price will be evaluated and calculated by the Purchasing Group, and the chairman or vice chairman, together with the treasurer and two members of the Storage Group, will sign and issue a receipt. (7) Regarding hiring a public granary office manager, it was decided to hire a reputable person to manage all routine public granary affairs.

Government-Subsidized Rice Sold Out Instantly

The eighth phase of government-subsidized rice sales, after a long period of preparation, finally began on schedule yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. The heavens were kind, and the rain stopped and the wind ceased in an instant. Although the cold was biting, the common people buying rice flocked to it in droves. Before the subsidized sales even began, the entrances of each subsidized sales point were crowded with people, a pitiful sight. These people, wearing thin clothes to ward off the cold, stood waiting by the roadside, waiting for the start of the rice sales. The various forms and colors were a rare and tragic sight. Most of these people were from the working class, dressed in rags and with haggard faces, reflecting the general state of starvation under the high cost of rice and firewood. However, although they were penniless, they understood the principles and maintained order in all places, without a sound. Yesterday, on the first day of rice sales, no less than 30,000 people bought rice. In less than three hours, the subsidized sales at each location were completely sold out. Today, on the second day, all procedures were completed last night.

Secret Investigation of Rice Stocks

At a time when there are continuous rumors of abundant stocks, some speculative rice weevils still find it difficult to change their ways, losing their minds, hoarding goods, and endangering public safety. Their crime is unforgivable. Yesterday, it was widely rumored in the city that the authorities of the two concessions were determined to deal with the rice vermin according to the law. They have already sent investigators to be responsible for secretly investigating the grain stocks in various rice warehouses and the names of hoarders in the city. Anyone who has been hoarding for a long time and is unwilling to easily sell will be arrested and sent to court for punishment once the investigation is verified. It is said that they will be prosecuted for the crime of endangering social security. At the same time, all their hoarded rice, regardless of quantity, will be confiscated and used for subsidized sales. According to another source, the relevant authorities in the city will register the rice stocks in the warehouses, including (1) the date of entry into the warehouse, (2) the origin and purchase price, and the name of the owner. At the same time, it was decided to limit the warehousing period. Once the deadline is reached, all goods must be removed from the warehouse. At that time, a legitimate profit can be given to sell on the spot. The English-language "North China Daily News" also stated that the general public believes that the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession are now "quietly" investigating private rice stocks in the city's warehouses in order to deal with them. Although officials from the two concessions did not deny or confirm this, some sources said that the authorities had already taken this step. If a thorough investigation can be carried out, the food situation may improve soon. Yesterday, after the two rice vermin, Zhang Junlong and Tan Minde, were detained and sentenced by the court to ten months of imprisonment and fifteen days of detention for violating price controls, the general speculative rice weevils and non-professional merchants were shocked, and transactions were unusually stagnant, with little activity on both sides.

Noodle Prices Increase

The Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association, with the agreement of Deputy General Manager He of the Shanghai Municipal Council, allowed the Fuxin and Fufeng factories to resume supplying half the amount of subsidized flour, totaling 2,030 bags for 376 companies over two days. The cost of subsidized flour increased to 21.5 yuan per bag, plus a handling fee of 0.3 yuan. However, the selling price of noodles was allowed to increase to 0.46 yuan per catty, sold at the listed price and not exceeding the prescribed price. However, wholesale noodle prices are not subject to this restriction due to cost factors. Regarding the 126 companies registered in the border area, they have been asking the association to supply subsidized flour. The association sent representatives to Deputy General Manager He of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday to request it. He agreed to increase the supply after the flour mills have sufficient raw materials, but for now, the distribution will be based on the previously determined number of companies.

### Bond Market Soars, Black Market Exchange Rate Loosens; Value of Legal Tender Rises; New Subsidiary Currency of Central Bank Already Shipped to Shanghai; Floating Capital Moves Inward, Financial Institutions Stabilize

After the US loan to China of 100 million US dollars and the British loan to China of 10 million pounds were successively established, half of each was used to stabilize the Chinese monetary system. Regarding the stabilization methods and application methods, Song Ziwen has agreed with the British and American authorities. The Chinese government has solemnly declared its determination to maintain the monetary system and creditworthiness, to stabilize foreign exchange with all its strength, and to maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate to protect the trade of friendly countries with China. As a result, the foundation of Chinese legal tender has become more solid, the official exchange rate has remained stable, the black market exchange rate has loosened, the value of legal tender has increased, and the prices of various postwar bonds in overseas markets have soared and are difficult to obtain. The domestic bond market has exceeded the wartime statutory price limit, stabilizing the national financial situation, benefiting Chinese and foreign merchants, and greatly improving the prospects for resistance and reconstruction.

Bond Market Soars, Chinese and Foreigners Compete to Buy

Prices in the overseas market for Chinese government bonds have repeatedly risen sharply, with British and American investors competing to buy Chinese government bonds. Postwar bonds have risen from £16 to £34, and Crisp bonds have risen from £12 to £26.5, and are still difficult to obtain. The domestic public bond market is surging because the government has decided not to suspend the payment of domestic debt secured by tariffs due to the seizure of tariff revenue in the war zone. The Central Bank was ordered to start discounting payments on January 31st for the tenth payment of principal and interest, which boosted morale and soaring prices. The Chinese people have been buying one after another, with Type A exceeding the government's listed statutory price limit of 76 yuan since August 13th. Moreover, the National Debt Fund Management Committee has decided to hold the eleventh lottery redemption on schedule from February.

Black Market Exchange Rate Stabilizes, Legal Tender Value Rises

Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee was established in March of the previous year, it has made every effort to stabilize the statutory foreign exchange and maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate. More than 5 million pounds of the 10 million pound fund remain, and the rumor that it has been exhausted has been proven untrue by the facts. Now that the British and American loans to China have been successful, China's foreign exchange fund has increased by another 50 million US dollars and 5 million pounds, which is sufficient to maintain the statutory foreign exchange and make it last, stabilize the Shanghai black market exchange rate to maintain the desired level, and resist Japan's economic aggression against China. As a result, the Shanghai foreign exchange black market has loosened, the black market price of legal tender has increased, and Chinese and foreign merchants have benefited greatly from trade. The scope of speculation has narrowed, and the once active black market has become quieter than before.

New Two-Cent Notes Shipped to Shanghai for Issuance

After the four major banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, adjusted the Shanghai legal tender and subsidiary currency as ordered by the Ministry of Finance, the Shanghai market has been sufficient for circulation. The past shortage and panic have now been completely reduced. The Central Bank's newly printed two-cent notes are printed by the Zhonghua Book Company Limited. The front has the words "Two Cents" and the serial number on the left, and a portrait of the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, on the right. The back has the words "Two Cents" in Arabic numerals printed in 1940. Both the front and back are in dark blue and lake green. It is said that the notes were shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai by friendly banks and have already circulated in the market.

Uniform Rejection of Miscellaneous Notes

The areas of the sea concessions that have not been approved by the Ministry of Finance have uniformly refused to accept and use them because the industries deeply understand the righteousness. Therefore, the market has not yet discovered them. It is said that the trade associations of various industries have received samples of these miscellaneous notes, which are divided into one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, as well as one cent, five cents, two cents, and five cents. It is said that they are printed by Huacheng Company, and the portrait of the Premier is exactly the same as the legal tender. All industries have decided to reject these miscellaneous notes.

Capital Moves Inward, Institutions Strengthen

The national financial market has stabilized after the four major state banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, and local financial institutions throughout the country jointly maintained it. The legitimate goods of various industries have entered the right track. The financial situation in isolated Shanghai is also the same. The capital that once flowed to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia has gradually returned to Shanghai and other parts of the country due to the uneasy situation in the Pacific. Shanghai has long been flooded with floating capital. After the banking and money industries found ways to solve the issue, the floating capital has been continuously moved into the mainland. Recently, remittances from Shanghai to the mainland have surged, because the government is encouraging the inward transfer of capital from the ports, exempting remittance fees and providing subsidies. For example, if more than 800 yuan is paid in Shanghai, 1,000 yuan will be fully received in Chongqing. As for remittances from the mainland to Shanghai, they will be strictly restricted, except for necessities such as purchasing goods, to prevent capital outflow.

### The United States is Doing its Best to Promote National Defense Production

Unemployment Situation Greatly Eased

National Defense Projects in Honolulu are Accelerating

According to a report in Continental News, according to crew members of the President Pierce, which arrived in Shanghai on Sunday, the unemployment situation in the United States has greatly eased since the promotion of national defense production. Although accurate statistics and results have not yet been officially announced, the general workers believe that the current employment opportunities are much more than a year ago. Most of those who had no fixed jobs have obtained fixed positions, and the emerging peacetime industries are also keeping pace with wartime armaments production. A large number of workers are currently moving to Honolulu because national defense projects are being actively built there. All ships have been requisitioned.

### Defense of the Central District of the Public Concession; Merchant Corps Continues Guarding; No Incidents Occurred in Four Months; Other Defense Forces Have No Right to Enter the District

The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a message yesterday to explain the importance of the Merchant Corps garrisoning District B, stating that since August of last year, the defense of District B of the Public Concession has been undertaken by the Municipal Council Merchant Corps to replace the British army. In other words, members of the Merchant Corps, sacrificing their spare time, have been serving the community by taking on the defense of District B for more than four months. The Corps has been trying to gradually reduce the number of garrisoned personnel to the minimum possible. However, in order to effectively control the district, it is currently not possible to reduce it further. Some employers believe that the number of personnel required in the district has been greatly reduced compared to the beginning, so the staff they employ should be relieved of their garrison duties. This attitude only increases the responsibility of other more enthusiastic employers and members.

Peaceful Defense Zone, Outstanding Achievements

The garrison of the Merchant Corps is equivalent to a defense force, providing moral and military assistance. If the Merchant Corps were not garrisoning the area, the defense would have to be undertaken by other defense forces. This type of work requires great perseverance and proper handling in order to be effective. Fortunately, since the Merchant Corps took over, no accidents have occurred, which is commendable. The area around District B is the defense zone of the defense forces of various countries and the French garrison. Their greatest task is to cooperate with each other and engage in the normal policing of Shanghai. Moreover, unless permitted by the Merchant Corps, other defense forces have no right to enter District B.

### Hua Yang Charity Association Promotes Winter Relief in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces; No Less Than Five or Six Hundred Thousand Extremely Poor Disaster Victims in the Two Provinces; Disaster Situation in Yixing is the Most Severe, Many Starving People in Shaoxing, Zhejiang; Charity Groups Prepare to Welcome Dr. Baker

Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are rich in products, and the general people lived and worked in peace before the war. Since the outbreak of the war, the occupied areas have suffered severely, and the people's lives have been difficult. Even in non-occupied areas, military actions have directly and indirectly affected the area, causing prices to rise. Last year, some farmland suffered from severe drought, and harvests were reduced, leading to the lower and middle classes losing their livelihoods and crying out for food. It is estimated that there are no less than five or six hundred thousand extremely poor disaster victims in various places. As the north wind is blowing, how will these disaster victims solve the problem of freezing and starvation? This is a serious problem. In view of this, the local Hua Yang Charity Association and others are actively promoting winter relief work to provide relief. The disaster situation in various places is summarized as follows:

The Disaster Situation in Yixing is Unprecedentedly Tragic

Among the occupied areas, the disaster situation in Yixing is more severe. Last year, drought occurred, and the county's agriculture was not cultivated at all, or those who cultivated also had no harvest. There are more than 676,000 acres of disaster-stricken farmland in the county, and more than 297,000 disaster victims. Refugees are everywhere, and the situation is tragic and unprecedented. The Yixing Shanghai Native Place Association has raised 40,000 yuan, and the National Government has allocated 20,000 yuan from Chongqing and the Hua Yang Charity Association 5,000 yuan, totaling 65,000 yuan, which will be distributed by the Charity Association. The Yixing Shanghai Native Place Association will send another telegram to the National Government, requesting continued allocation of funds. Songjiang has also suffered, and the disaster situation is very serious. The church relief association jointly formed by Christianity and Catholicism has been carrying out relief work, distributing white rice three to five liters per person four times a month. However, due to its limited strength, it has been successively provided with funds from the Hua Yang Charity Association and others to expand winter relief.

The Disaster Situation is Severe in Eastern Zhejiang

In Shaoxing, Zhejiang, rice prices have been affected by military action, exceeding 130 yuan per picul, so the disaster is severe. According to local reports, more than 200 people die of starvation every day. Currently, Dr. Afute of the International Relief Committee has established four porridge factories in the county, and more than 5,000 disaster victims receive porridge every day. The Hua Yang Charity Association has allocated 10,000 yuan to help, and other funds have been collected from various sources. The situation in Zhuji and Ningbo is also worrying. The Hua Yang Charity Association and other charity groups have sent people to investigate and will also set up porridge factories to promote winter relief for those in urgent need of relief.

Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Announces Sustenance

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association announced that since last year, when it successively provided funds and disbanded able-bodied refugees, it still provided accommodation to elderly and child refugees. By the end of the year, the association had accommodated 14,945 refugees. Due to soaring prices, the sustenance for each refugee had also risen to 11.1 yuan, so the monthly sustenance expenses still required 165,894.2 yuan. This huge expenditure has always been raised and donated by enthusiastic people from all walks of life in the city. When the association was first established in November 1938, it accommodated 54,491 refugees, and the sustenance for each person per month was 1.9 yuan. The total monthly expenditure only needed 100,352.9 yuan. Comparing it with the end of last year, the difference is ten times. The sustenance standard price in November 1938 was 10 yuan per picul of rice, 28.85 yuan per ton of coal, 0.09 yuan per pound of salt, and 0.2 yuan per pound of oil. By the end of last year, the price of rice had increased to 70 yuan per picul, coal to 107.5 yuan per ton, salt to 0.18 yuan per pound, and oil to 0.8 yuan per pound. Therefore, when it was first established, the number of refugees accommodated was large, but the sustenance expenses were small. Now, the number of people in foster care has decreased by nearly four times, but the sustenance expenses have increased, making it difficult to maintain. Yesterday, the association published a notice to all sectors of society, listing the monthly number of people accommodated and sustenance statistics for the two years from November 1938 to December 1940, so that people in society could understand everything.

The Pharmaceutical Industry is Praised by the Authorities for Selling Rice at Subsidized Prices

The local New Pharmaceutical Industry Association has been selling white rice at subsidized prices in the two concessions since November 5th of last year. The public concession rice selling point is at 730 Wenjianshi Road, Qianye Guild Hall, and the French concession is at 99 Zhiyuan Fahui, 78 Lane, Du Shenfu Road. Each place sells 6,000 catties of hot rice every day, 0.2 yuan per catty, and each person is limited to one catty at a time. Since the start of the program, a total of more than 90,000 yuan has been sacrificed. Their enthusiasm for public welfare and benefiting the poor is admirable. The Shanghai Municipal Council expressed its admiration for this. It is said that the subsidized sale of white rice will continue. As for the distribution of steamed buns by the charity group, the amount of flour has been increased to 50 bags. Xu Shiying's daughter, chairman of the Zhen Association, personally went to visit and distribute the buns yesterday.

### The Success Story of Reuters

Film Made, to be Shown Tomorrow

The importance of the news industry has been deeply understood by countries around the world. The speed of news transmission today is so fast that international situations can be transmitted to all parts of the world in half a minute. Compared to the days when news was transmitted by carriages, the speed of progress cannot be measured in miles. When we read the newspaper, we often find the word "Reuters" at the beginning and end of the news. Who is Reuters? He is the first person to create the news industry. The news industry has come to this day because of Reuters alone. A century ago, Reuters worked in a bank, copying market quotations every day. After leaving his job, he set up his own pigeon station, which could transmit the market quotations of the day to the East in a few hours, much faster than other information. Reuters then used pigeons to transmit news, first with Paris as the station, and later moved to London due to changes in the political situation. He set up a small room as an office, specializing in the transmission of commercial news. People in society gradually knew of Reuters. Reuters then set up branch offices in Germany, France, and the Netherlands. After his hard work, he founded The Times. At that time, the situation between France and Austria was deteriorating, and people around the world were eager to hear the French king's speech first. Reuters then visited the French king, and the French king's speech was transmitted to London from the telegram in half an hour. The people in Paris were able to read the full text of the speech a few hours later. Reuters's position was thus consolidated, his reputation was enhanced, and the news industry flourished and reached today. Reuters's success is due to his spirit of perseverance and unyieldingness. Reuters's career has reached a point of great importance. Reuters's life story has become a model for people in all walks of life to know. From the 9th of this month, the Nanjing Grand Theater in this city will show the Warner Bros. film "Reuters", starring actor Edward G. Robinson, which is a must-see blockbuster. We will give advance notice to fulfill our reporting responsibilities.

### Rotary Club's Regular Meeting This Week

### The So-Called Yarn and Flower Market is Not Permitted by Law; Will Open Immediately After the General Settlement

The Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange was ordered to stop auctioning after August 13th, and has not been restored due to the special environment. As for the dark market for yarn in Shanghai, it is also an illegal organization. Due to the manipulation of speculators, prices have soared and plummeted, becoming the only paradise for speculators, similar to the so-called gold dark market. Recently, someone organized the so-called yarn and flower market, which was originally intended to borrow the old site of the Adowa Road Yarn and Cloth Exchange, but was rejected by the authorities of the exchange. It is said that a certain house has been selected and will be repaired and arranged, and it is planned to open for trading after the general settlement. It is actually a disguised yarn and cloth exchange. According to the Exchange Law, a similar exchange cannot be set up in the same area, so the establishment of the market is not permitted by Chinese law. Now, due to the poor environment in Shanghai, it was established without the approval of the Ministry of Finance and Economics, which is slightly similar to the Japanese-run Cotton Industry Exchange. Regarding the Council of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange, they do not want to express any opinion on this so-called yarn and flower market.

### Summary of Important News

The local White Russian Immigrant Committee recently established a White Russian Beggar Shelter on Tangshan Road, Hongkou, which has accommodated 25 White Russian beggars. It is also planning to set up another one in the French Concession, but it has not yet been established because a house has not been found.

According to reliable information from the shipping industry, smuggling is rampant in Mao Island, Sanmen Bay (belonging to Ninghai County). The Ninghai County Government ordered the police to seize 20,000 red pills at Yang Xianmou's house. The county government ordered that Yang Xianmou be arrested and brought to justice, and sent personnel to seal off all his property together with the township security chief.

The post office announced that in the future, for parcels and small packages of goods sent to Shantou, it is not necessary to submit the permits issued by the appropriate local authorities when mailing. However, when delivering, the permit must still be presented.

### Briton Shot and Killed in Bailinan Road Post Office; Tried to Capture Thief Robbing Russian Woman; Shot Once, Seriously Wounded, Died

Latham, a British employee of the British-owned Public Welfare Yarn Factory, was 36 years old and lived at 129 Jixifeier Road. Yesterday at 1:20 PM, he went to the Bailinan Road Post Office to mail a letter. At the same time, a Russian woman was also mailing a letter at the post office. At that time, three armed bandits suddenly came. One person guarded the gate of the post office, and the other two went inside, pointed a gun at the Russian woman, and robbed her of the diamond ring and wallet on her hand. Seeing this, Latham disregarded his own safety, stepped forward and knocked down one of the bandits, and snatched the gun. He was about to deal with the remaining bandits, but unexpectedly, another bandit shot him in the back. Latham was shot, the bullet passed through his right lung and came out of his chest. He fell to the ground and repeatedly called for someone to call the police. At that time, the staff in the post office were all stunned and dumbfounded. After the bandits left, they called the Jing'an Temple Road Patrol Room and sent a group of detectives to the scene. At the same time, the Japanese military police also rushed to the scene after hearing the news. They first took Latham to the Hongen Hospital for treatment, but he soon died because the bullet hit a vital spot. At that time, the detectives searched for the bandits around the post office, but found nothing. Mrs. Latham fainted on the spot after hearing the news. After the family's emergency treatment, she was still unable to get out of bed, so Latham's funeral arrangements will have to wait until his wife recovers.

### Nephew Conspires with Accomplices to Steal Aunt's Jewelry: Confession Details Drug-Induced Stupor; Key Suspect Still at Large, Hearing Postponed

A woman named Zhou Shuangmei, who makes a living selling jewelry, was widowed early in life. She lived with her husband's sister, Zhou Afu, on the upper floor of a building at 51 Hart Road. On the evening of the 5th of this month, at around 9 p.m., a handbag belonging to Zhou Shuangmei, containing three large and small diamond rings, one jade ring, 450 pearls, 200 old lustrous pearls, two pearl bracelets and one dragon bracelet, worth 40,000 yuan, was suddenly stolen from her residence. She immediately reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Under the direction of Chinese Detective Yao Yuanlong and Detectives Ni Jiafeng and Zhang Youming, along with Western Detective Greenfell, an investigation was launched, and the

Case Suspects Apprehended

Two individuals, Zhou Muquan from Suzhou and Wang Guoyu from Shanghai, were apprehended. A jade ring and twelve individual diamonds were found on Wang. A diamond ring worth 5,000 yuan was also retrieved from the Tongchang Pawnshop at 274 Avenue Edward VII and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Attorney Zhang Tianyin charged them with robbery, stating that the defendant Zhou Muquan is Zhou Shuangmei's nephew and resides in the front building at number 51. Some time ago, Zhou Muquan met his friends Xie Jinliang and Wang Guoyu at the Jindu Dance Hall. Finding himself

Short on Funds

As the end of the year approached, Zhou suggested robbing his aunt Zhou Shuangmei's jewelry. They discussed the plan in a room at the Andong Hotel on Hubei Road and decided to proceed with the robbery. Xie was tasked with obtaining a sedative pill and instructed Zhou to return home and put it in the tea to make her dizzy. They set the date for the evening of January 5th. When Zhou Shuangmei had not returned from selling jewelry outside, Zhou Muquan mixed the pill into a lemon tea and asked Zhou Afu to drink it. This was around 6 p.m. However, Zhou Shuangmei happened to return home with the handbag and saw Afu drinking tea, unaware that the tea contained a drug. After a while, Zhou Muquan suddenly suggested

Playing Mahjong Together

Zhou Shuangmei, two tenants named Wang and Qin, and Muquan's father, Long Xing, formed a group in Muquan's room in the front building. Before long, the drug took effect, causing Zhou Afu, who was washing dishes on the balcony, to suddenly faint. She was helped into the room to lie down. At this time, Muquan left the door open, and Xie and Wang sneaked in, heading straight to the upper floor and stealing the handbag. In a daze, Zhou Afu vaguely saw someone enter the room and awoke. She tried to turn on the light, but the wires had been cut. Realizing something was wrong, she shouted loudly and discovered that the

Handbag Had Been Stolen

She reported the incident to the police station. After investigation by Chinese and Western detectives, the above situation was clarified, leading to the arrests. Xie is currently on the run, and some of the stolen goods have not yet been recovered. The prosecution requested a postponement. Zhou Shuangmei and Zhou Afu also complained that all the jewelry was brokered from the Leyuan Public Association on Second Malu, requesting a thorough investigation. When questioned, Zhou Muquan and Wang Guoyu confessed to the accusations, but claimed that all the jewelry was taken by Xie, and they received nothing. Judge Zhong reviewed the confession and ordered the defendants to be detained for a continued hearing on the 14th.

### Zhou Meiquan Narrowly Escapes Kidnapping

Lucky to Have Seen the Danger Early and Pressed the Alarm; Detectives Arrived, but the Bandits Had Already Fled

Zhou Meiquan, a 62-year-old Anhui native residing at 475 Route Lafargue in the French Concession, was formerly the Governor-General of Liangjiang during the Qing Dynasty. He lives in Shanghai as a retired official and owns a private car with license plate number 11780. Yesterday afternoon at around 4 p.m., Zhou intended to go out. As the driver was pulling the car out of the garage, four kidnappers wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, two of whom were armed with guns, were seen lurking near the garage. As Zhou stepped out of the iron gate, he caught sight of the four men and, realizing they were not good people, immediately turned back and instructed the driver to close the iron gate. He then pressed the alarm bell to call for help from the police. By the time the police arrived, the bandits had already fled without a trace.

### Miscellaneous Theft Reports

A Japanese employee named Aizawa Kiyoshi, number 846 of the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, was on his way home to Hongkou from the police station at around 10:15 p.m. on the 3rd. While walking east along Jing'an Temple Road, he reached the corner of Xiaoshazhe Road and was suddenly confronted by three people. Two of them, armed with handguns, forced him to take off his raincoat and stole eight yuan in Japanese military currency and 127 yuan in legal tender before fleeing.

At 418 Hart Road in West Shanghai, two bandits broke in yesterday morning at around 6 a.m. One was armed with a handgun, and the other held a small knife. They threatened the residents into silence and stole 1,578.60 yuan in national currency before fleeing.

### "Private"

— Jue Hui

When the word "private" is mentioned, everyone seems to have an air of "top secret"...

In the past, everything had to be done in secret. Any "public" display could be life-threatening. That's why things like: treacherous officials torturing loyal subjects in secret; young ladies making secret engagements in the back gardens... and other such "private tricks" happened! But, "if you don't want others to know, don't do it in the first place." The magic lantern show will eventually be exposed, and then: the treacherous officials are executed; the young ladies hang themselves!

Now, supposedly the times have "progressed," so those kinds of things don't need to be done "privately" anymore. Traitorous officials can freely oppress loyal subjects without anyone daring to utter a peep; young ladies can choose their own husbands by simply announcing "I love him," and everything is resolved. Anyway, if things don't work out, they can just hire a lawyer, go to court, and get a divorce to end it all!

So, does that mean everything is out in the open now? No, no! As the saying goes, "It's always been this way, and now it's even worse!" The "private" sphere now surpasses what it was before.

Someone hoarding hundreds of dan of rice in their warehouse still complains that the price of rice is "unusually" high; a son doing something shady outside is "hush-hush" even in front of his own mother; and there are even more "clever people" who constantly complain about being poor while secretly grabbing everything they can get their hands on, like maggots in a latrine! These are all 100% "private" matters: and they appear "mysterious" and "profound"... not to be revealed to outsiders.

However, since the causes are the same, the consequences are generally the same as well. Once the mask is removed, and the "private affairs" are exposed, there are only two possible outcomes: execution! Suicide!

### Beyond the Dinner Party

— Zuo Hui

How is the New Year celebrated? The newspapers are full of "Happy New Year" greetings and famous quotes; step outside, and the walls, corners, telephone poles, and mailboxes are covered with red strips replacing "bring me wealth" with slogans like "expel wolves, welcome victory."

Big companies and stores are all closed for the holidays. Managers, directors, and chiefs are all busy attending dinner parties. Plans are made in advance, so even before New Year's Day, the rooms have already been booked. No need to worry about the cost of the rooms either. There are plenty of people coming to play mahjong, and the commission from the games, besides covering the table fees, can also cover the cost of food, dishes, and fruit. The official date of the dinner party is New Year's Day, and the fee is 30 yuan per person. There are 11 people, so the total is 330 yuan. It seems more than enough to have a dinner party with that amount, so no wonder everyone calls the purchasing department director a "miser" behind his back. He sticks out his tongue and asks the person in charge, "Old Wu, how much is a table of dishes?"

"I think it will cost at most 100 silver dollars."

"Then what will we do with the rest?"

"What will we do with the rest? There are plenty of other things to spend it on."

The purchasing department director rolled his eyes and wanted to ask more, but then he heard Mr. Huang's voice, "Broken nine, two, three concealed kong!" "Pair pair win," three fan! Hot, right! Old Wu heard that it was Mr. Huang's voice. He and Mr. Huang were in a 40/60 partnership, which made him so happy that he couldn't stop smiling. He rushed over, leaving the purchasing department director alone.

"How can he be the director of the purchasing department? He's just a yokel!" Old Wu thought to himself. "330 yuan, what's enough to spend? Maybe he thought I was going to skim some off the top."

The purchasing department director really couldn't handle the "big scene." He couldn't smoke, couldn't play dominoes, and got nervous when he saw money. He had no choice but to lie on the sofa, grumbling to himself, "Dinner party? Is this really a dinner party? It's just gambling." His stomach started rumbling, but Old Wu shouted, "Let's finish four rounds before eating." So, the slapping sound of the mahjong tiles continued.

At 7:30, Director Ji woke up from a nap on the sofa. The dishes had been laid out, and everyone started eating. Director Ji could be said to be the only one who really came for the dinner party. He ate with great enthusiasm. Some of them seemed to have ulterior motives, secretly discussing something and passing things back and forth; finally, they passed them to the purchasing department director. He looked at them with a mouthful of beef and saw that the paper was full of pictures of girls, "Beauties"!

"Mr. Ji, which one do you like?" Mr. Huang asked seriously, and everyone's eyes were glued to Director Ji's face.

"We're here for a dinner party, let's not have a 'beauty party'," Director Ji said with a smile, as if mocking everyone. "I'm leaving after I finish eating."

Old Wu stood by the telephone and said, "Okay, then three?"

"Okay, three."

So, Old Wu dialed the phone.

The dinner party ended, and the sound of dominoes continued. The purchasing department director said goodbye, and Old Wu saw him off. Just as Director Ji stepped out of the room, three girls arrived. He took a step back to let them in first, then with a hot face, savoring the taste of the beef, Director Ji left. In the room, the lewd laughter of men and women rang out.

"Thirty yuan per person, it turns out there's more than just a dinner party," the purchasing department director seemed to understand something in the elevator.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Even now, six or seven days later, Wang Yuqin still regrets having taken that extra look that day. It's not that the person looked as ugly as Zhang Fei or Dou Erdun, giving him nightmares after seeing him. Nor is it that the person looked as handsome as Zhou Yu or Zhang Junrui, making him unable to stop thinking about him when he got back. In reality, this person had a very ordinary face, just a bit fatter than most people. Yuqin didn't find this face particularly strange. What frightened him most was the pair of eyes on that face, a pair of eyes that were round, large, sharp, and cruel, fully containing a kind of barely restrained bestiality.

When Yuqin looked back, his eyes met those four eyes exactly, making him panic and unable to avoid them.

"Good!" Those sitting on either side of this person immediately shouted "Good!" in a very accommodating manner. Then, a series of strange owl-like laughter told him that the fat man was gloating with self-satisfaction!

As a result, Yuqin's performance was greatly affected. He felt that that pair of bestial eyes was constantly fixed on him, never leaving, forcing him to want to run backstage immediately, take off his female costume, and restore his original appearance. Later, he almost forgot his lines. Fortunately, the applause from the audience was like his predetermined windfall, rising for no reason, allowing him to enter the backstage without receiving the scolding he had expected.

"Singing the role of a female lead is not for human beings!" he said angrily, rushing to pull off his headdress.

"As long as you can make up your own mind, what's there to be afraid of?" His second brother, Yu Kun, dressed as Zhu Guangzu, holding a single-edged sword, stood behind him watching him take off his makeup, encouraging him in a very crisp manner, while continuously spewing out a wujiapi aroma. Without asking, one knew that he had secretly bought wine with the pocket money he had earned tonight.

Yuqin had nothing to say. He had no choice but to throw the clothes he had taken off, in a fit of pique, over to the clothing trunk. (Three)

If you believe that one task is worthless and are unwilling to do it, and another task is also worthless and you are unwilling to do it, I ask you, what task are you willing to do?

### Snake Talk in the Year of the Snake

— Zhong Zimang

In the display windows of city companies, you can see beautiful snake-patterned ties; in museums, you can see real snakeskins immersed in pale yellow alcohol in glass tubes. The patterns are fine and patterned. Of course, those snake-patterned ties pale in comparison. However, I think the snakeskins displayed in museums are nothing more than beautiful shells. If it were truly a living snake writhing in the wild, it would be even more temptingly beautiful to think about.

In mythology, the snake is a tempter: Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit and caused eternal regret, which was also said to be due to the temptation of the snake! Snakes trick people, and they do it unconsciously. This is a cunning animal. Even its counterpart, the centipede, has a fierce-looking red head and countless pincer-like claws, which make people feel a little fear and caution. As for the snake, there are even imitation snakeskin ties sold in the world, worn between men's snow-white stiff collars and perfumed suits. It is clear that people have long been seduced by the beauty of snakes.

However, the snake is a bad thing. It is greedy, it is vicious, and it uses beauty and temptation to cover up its brutality. It will devour people and spread venom. Therefore, when traveling, you must carry a cane to hit the snake. As for the method of hitting, you must be quick-eyed and quick-handed, with strength in your hands. It is best to hit it head-on; if you hit it on the body, it will slip away. Its escape route is winding and tortuous, so when the snake escapes and disappears in an instant, you must immediately look for it along the winding path. It will definitely make the snake be "subjected to torture."

Hit it if you see it. Even if there is no snake, you have to beware of snakes. Although "drawing a snake in a cup" describes a state of suspicion, we must always have this suspicion in our current lives. - Especially since it's not a "snake shadow" shaking, right?

"Snake talk in the Year of the Snake" is indeed a "cultured person's" timely topic, citing the ancient to prove the present, discussing poetry and literature. However, somehow, because of the snake, I often think of a certain type of person in society, which makes people think even more of the fable of the snake swallowing the elephant - the snake swallows the elephant's nose, and then greedily swallows the elephant, until with a snap, the narrow snake body bursts...

### "Rice Pearl Lament" — A Lament for Shanghai's Starving Corpses and a Warning to the Newly Rich Rice Merchants

— Yang Yunshi

The world is poor, suddenly many rich.
A dou of rice costs one hundred thousand cash,
Those who obtain it are not my farmers.
A chi of silk is an average person's wealth,
Those who obtain it are not my workers.
Copper mountains enter private chambers,
Starving corpses are like flying weeds!
Southeast's years are bountiful,
Year after year, harvests are abundant.
Transport ships fill the rivers and lakes,
Why are they hidden empty?
Inland, grains are hurt by cheapness,
Stopping sales exhausts all goods.
They collude to monopolize,
Cutting off the work of ships.
Rich oils flow eastward to the sea,
Ten thousand ships rush to supply it.
A meager, chaotic remainder,
Like precious pearls and rare goods.
Hundreds of thousands every morning and evening,
Claiming to be Tao Zhugong.
Food is the people's heaven,
How much more in times of war.
At this time, warmth and fullness are difficult,
A hundred li are filled with lamentations.
In the morning, hunger screams at the wife,
In the evening, she sells a child.
Alas, my children,
How can we continue to eat!
Gold fights white bones,
Rice determines the victorious and the defeated.
Quiet nights have no sound to lose,
Intermittent rain mixes with wind.
The few grow fat on the leanness of the masses,
Little ones beat drums and attack.
Cao Zhi rushed too quickly to the front,
Beans weep in the pot!
Greed is an inauspicious thing,
Monsters gather in the morning mist.
It is fitting to throw them to tigers and wolves,
Five punishments are not allowed to be used.
Killing one person results in death,
The law punishes its wickedness.
Daily slaughtering ten thousand without bloodshed,
Slaughterous aura fills the sky at the riverhead.
Alas, Buddha says hell is full,
Heaven sees and heaven hears clearly and wisely,
Hungry ghosts and evil paths are filled with Deng Tong.

Entertainment World

### Talking About "Spinning Cotton"

— Li Yunying

Recently, in the opera world, the play "Spinning Cotton" has unexpectedly become so popular. Currently, there are two female performers who can sing it well: 1. Wu Suqiu; 2. Tong Zhiling. They have been performing it consecutively at the Golden Sun Theater for many times. The box office results have already been seen by the audience, so I don't need to elaborate further.

However, in recent performances of "Spinning Cotton," only the scene in the middle where Zhang San "returns home and teases" is performed. In fact, there are many other scenes before and after, such as Zhang San wooing his wife, going out to trade, Zhang's wife having an affair, returning home and teasing, revealing the affair, the lover plotting to murder her husband, the case breaking out, a trial in court, and both being executed. The whole play takes more than three hours to perform, similar to Xiao Cuihua's "Double Nail Record" and "Ma Siyuan." It is listed as one of the Eight Great Plays of the Qing Dynasty, and it was a very famous play in its time.

I still remember the heyday of "Spinning Cotton" was around 1921. It was really popular all over Beijing and Shanghai. At that time, it was Thirteenth Dan (i.e., Liu Yirong, not Hou Junxian) and En Xiaofeng (a male actor playing a female comic role) who often performed it at the Guangdelou Theater in the old capital. Later, female Dan Zhang Wenyan also sang it extensively in the south, and they all became very popular. However, there was another female Dan who became popular later in Beijing, called Bi Yunxia. A certain refined person (I can't remember the name) even changed the name of the play for her to "Reeling Silk Maiden." In addition, there was also Little Ma Wu, who was very popular in the Shanghai area for a while, and often performed with plays like "Wei Garlic." After 1928, due to the Northern Expedition Revolution, the authorities ordered a ban on such plays, so they were neglected for almost ten years. Who knew that after the war, in the isolated island and the occupied old capital, they would suddenly become popular and revitalized!

### Zhangtai Willow

— Gu Mingdao

After Liu Rushi recovered her health, she no longer cared about what Mu Zhai was doing outside. She sat quietly in her room every day, studying Buddhism. She was too lazy to write poetry, and had neglected her inkstone. She no longer had the clear and elegant mood to sing and beat the earthen drum while leaning on the balcony. The boring years passed quickly. At this time, Jiangnan was full of compliant subjects. The flags of the former dynasty were nowhere to be seen, and the nobles of the new dynasty flaunted their power. Yushan County had long surrendered to the embrace of the Aisin Gioro clan. The bloody battle of Jiangyin and the massacre of Jiading had just passed. Mu Zhai's ambition had already been shaken, and he was inevitably surrounded by villains, who joined them in becoming their accomplices, not hesitating to kneel and serve the Qing Dynasty. Mu Zhai accepted an official position from the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Although he was still listed as a Shangshu, the Qing court was only implementing a policy of appeasement and did not attach much importance to him. Because he was ultimately a literati and did not have any meritorious political achievements, he was not as favored as other hawks and hounds, and he often asked for leave to stay at home. Liu Rushi wrote in the air, lamenting helplessly. After all, she was a weak woman, how could she resist this surging tide? One day, Mu Zhai went to Nanjing, and she sat alone upstairs, very bored. She happened to pick up a collection of poems by Yu Zishan and recited several of them, and thoughts of the former kingdom surged again. Suddenly, she saw a servant girl report that a large man had come outside, wanting to see Madame Liu, claiming to have important matters to discuss in person. Liu Rushi did not know who he was and was afraid that he was a villain, so she said to the servant girl, "The master is not at home. He is a guest from afar, what does he want to see me for? Why did you report so easily? You can go and say that I am not feeling well and cannot see him." The servant girl nodded and left. After a while, she ran upstairs again, her face flushed, and reported, "This servant followed Madame Liu's orders and replied to him accordingly, but the large man insisted on seeing Madame Liu. He is relying on not leaving, and said that if she doesn't report, he will break into the boudoir himself. His expression is very rude, so I have come again to ask for Madame Liu's instructions." Liu Rushi frowned: "Is there really such an unwelcome guest here? Why don't you ask for his name?" (29)

### Yao Ke Directs "Wedding March"

— Lin

In Shanghai's theater scene, in addition to a shortage of scripts, there is also a shortage of directing talent. However, in recent years, the position of theater itself has gradually improved, and it has been given more attention. For example, Zhang Junxiang, Zuo Lin, and Yao Ke specifically went overseas to study theater, which had never been seen before. Of course, it is not because they have been gilded that they will be different at all. It is also a fact that they can bring back a little more new things from overseas. For example, Zuo Lin's direction of "Small Town Story" and "The Liar," its novel techniques, opened up new avenues for future stage performances. Now, the new playwright Yao Ke, who has returned from the United States, has also resolutely stood up to work for the Shanghai theater scene. The drama club's opening play "Wedding March" will be directed by Yao Ke. "Wedding March" was written by the Soviet Kotayev, which Yao Ke, who has been to the Soviet Union and seen Soviet plays, can easily handle and achieve great success. Obviously, the emergence of specialized talents like Yao Ke will lay a more solid foundation for the Shanghai theater scene.

### (19) Meng Lijing Observes the Portrait

Meng Lijing disguised herself as a man under the name Li Mingtang. She excelled in the imperial examinations and eventually rose to the highest ranks of the court. Her family believed she had drowned herself in the Kunming River, and even her fiancé, Huangfu Shaohua, mourned her death, lamenting that they never became husband and wife.

Later, Huangfu Shaohua passed the autumn imperial examinations. In name, Li Mingtang was still his "benefactor." Although he had doubts, he dared not expose her identity rashly. Finally, he used the opportunity of observing a portrait – Meng Lijing's self-portrait – to subtly reveal the truth of the matter. (See illustration)

### (20) Strolling in the Shanglin Garden

"Shanglin Garden" can be understood in common terms as the "Imperial Garden." Emperor Chengzong had long seen through Li Mingtang's gender, but he was unwilling to expose her secret; the reason being that this "romantic emperor" harbored a desire for Meng Lijing.

In the third month of late spring, Emperor Chengzong strolled in the Shanglin Garden, traveling with a small entourage, but he specifically requested "Minister Li to escort him." He attempted to entice her with playful words, but Meng Lijing valued "love above all else" and remained unmoved.

Such a spirit, that of "wealth and status cannot sway her heart, foreign houses and cars cannot shake her steadfastness," is difficult, alas, to find among the so-called modern daughters of today!
