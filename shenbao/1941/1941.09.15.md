### Hull Announces: No New Progress in U.S.-Japan Talks; Testing Possibility of Resolving Pacific Issues; Exploratory Talks Deadline Expires Tomorrow

United Press, Washington, 14th: Secretary of State Hull stated at a press conference yesterday that there has been no new development in the U.S.-Japan talks. When asked about rumors of a fundamental agreement having been reached between Tokyo and Washington, Hull said that the talks, up to now, remain exploratory in nature, based on understanding whether negotiations to resolve Pacific issues are possible.

United Press, London, 14th: Reliable diplomatic sources here stated yesterday that they have learned that the United States has set a final deadline for the U.S.-Japan exploratory talks, at most extending to Tuesday. These sources also said that Washington, to prevent Japan's usual delaying tactics, has limited the talks to one month, which ends on Tuesday. Whether this period will be extended is unknown.

Reuters, Auckland, 14th: New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, after returning from Britain and North America, gave a speech saying that U.S.-Japan talks are still in a delicate stage. However, one thing is quite clear: there will be no appeasement policy at the expense of the League of Nations. It is hoped that Japan will accept this fact. While in the U.S., he had a thorough discussion with President Roosevelt on the Pacific situation.

Reuters, Tokyo, 14th: Japanese news agency reports that Special Advisor to the Japanese Minister Without Portfolio and Ambassador to the United States, Wakasugi, who returned to Tokyo for consultations just two weeks ago, is now scheduled to depart from Yokohama tomorrow at 3:00 PM to return to his post in Washington. As far as is currently known, there are no ships departing from Yokohama to the United States or elsewhere tomorrow, nor is there evidence of other passengers departing at the same time. However, Wakasugi's hasty return to his post may indicate that a satisfactory outcome to the U.S.-Japan talks is not entirely hopeless. Judging from the current situation, Japan's proposals and the United States' counterproposals seem to be neither entirely satisfactory nor completely unacceptable.

Talks Undergo Three Stages; Success or Failure Remains Uncertain

United Press, London, 14th: The outline of an Anglo-American understanding with Japan regarding the Far East and the Pacific appeared to be taking shape yesterday. However, as the fate of the talks between Tokyo and Washington remains unresolved, the final decision remains uncertain. Observers believe that Tokyo has not made a definite decision regarding the major proposals under discussion. This discussion appears to be focused on Japan's withdrawal from central and southern China. It is heard that under consideration is Japan's guarantee not to further expand north at the expense of the Soviet Union, or to engage in aggression in the south at the expense of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Thailand. After four years of war, Japan, besides its economic desires in China and Vietnam, seems willing to give up everything else. In this regard, it seems that the democratic nations will be urged to make significant concessions, while giving due consideration to Japan's face. All of this seems to predict the recognition of Japan's special economic status in China and certain other areas of East Asia, and the lifting of all financial and commercial sanctions against Japan. The United States and Japan, in these negotiations, have received direct and important support from the Soviet Union. The United States' position on Japan is believed to have slightly strengthened because of the news that the Soviet Union has not withdrawn any of its troops and aircraft from the Far East. Reliable sources say that the Soviet Union's Far East forces remain intact in terms of manpower and materiel, and Moscow has also decided to refuse any territorial concessions to Japan, nor will it appease Tokyo. The Netherlands and Britain are now working closely with the United States in the Pacific, and China has a firm commitment to the democratic nations. According to the latest news, the Soviet Union has taken its first and special action in the Far East ABCD line, although details cannot be obtained, diplomatic sources said that they have obtained a clear background of the U.S.-Japan talks. It is said that the first stage was when Washington, before Japan occupied Vietnam, proposed that Vietnam and Thailand be made neutral, like Switzerland, but Japan refused and subsequently occupied Vietnam, so this proposal had to be abandoned. The second stage was when the United States, after Vietnam was occupied by Japan, reiterated the request, saying that if Japan withdrew from Vietnam, the United States would unfreeze Japanese assets and abolish commercial embargoes. When this news reached Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, there was great unease in Chongqing. The beginning of the third stage was when Japan, disregarding the United States' proposal, put forward its own plan, which included two main points: that Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Australia stop expanding their armaments, and that the United States use its position to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese conflict. Foreign diplomats here said that it is astonishing that Washington did not consider subsequent measures, but agreed to conduct talks with Tokyo based on Japan's proposals. This move seems to coincide with President Roosevelt's first talks with Japanese Ambassador Nomura after returning from his meeting with Churchill at sea. It is believed that Washington, in order to avoid Japan's consistent delaying tactics, has limited the talks to one month, which expires next Monday. Whether the period of the talks will be extended further is still unknown. It is said that the United States further clarified its position in August, issuing a warning to Japan to prevent it from advancing north into the Soviet Union or continuing its southward advance.

Japan Seeks Understanding with U.S.; Army Reorganization of Great Significance

United Press, Tokyo, 14th: According to Far East observers, Japan hopes to improve relations with the United States. If negotiations fail, Japan is prepared to do its utmost to expand its hegemony in the East, or else end it all with death. Observers point out that the new centralized management of the Japanese army indicates an easing of tensions in the Pacific, but also indicates a more effective national mobilization. Some observers believe that Japan, as a result of its past policies, will not be able to extricate itself from its difficulties in today's situation. Moreover, the United States will never give up its consistent policy of Open Door and Equal Opportunity. Therefore, if Japan does not make further concessions, the current negotiations are bound to fail. Several things are worth noting: that the Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria and Vietnam are not included in this army reorganization process in Tokyo, because the Japanese troops in the above-mentioned places still retain their consistent right to independent action.

### U.S. Government Considers Arming Merchant Ships; Not Likely to Materialize Soon; President Takes Another Sea Trip

United Press, Washington, 14th: Due to repeated attacks on American merchant ships, it has been proposed that merchant ships also be armed. This matter is currently under discussion, but officials stated yesterday that this move is unlikely to be implemented in the near future. Observers have learned that some members of Congress raised this issue during a recent meeting between President Roosevelt and legislative leaders at the White House. It is said that the President indicated that he would raise this request in a few days.

Reuters, Washington, 14th: President Roosevelt has left here by car for Annapolis to join his yacht for a weekend cruise at sea. The President will discuss production and distribution issues with key officials from the Department of Defense and the Lend-Lease program over the weekend.

### Guerrillas Hide in Manchuria, Awaiting Opportunity to Attack Japanese Troops; Approximately 100,000 Undergoing Austere Training

Chongqing: A guerrilla leader told the United Press today that there are currently 100,000 Chinese, Korean, and Mongolian guerrillas hiding in the ancient pine forests and snow-covered mountains of Manchuria, awaiting an opportunity to attack the Japanese Kwantung Army. The leader, currently in Chongqing, said that these powerful guerrillas are now eagerly awaiting Japanese action, as they could immediately become a large-scale fifth column of the Soviet Far East Red Army. He said that these well-equipped and powerful Red Army forces within Manchuria are receiving austere training from military instructors of Soviet, Chinese, Korean, and even Japanese nationality, in accordance with Soviet Red Army and Communist doctrines. The leader also said that these guerrillas use the Soviet hammer and sickle flag as their national flag. (United Press, 14th)

### Madame Chiang Gifts U.S. with Panda from Xikang

Chongqing: Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, and Madame Kung Hsiang-hsi, Soong Ai-ling, have jointly donated a panda to the United China Relief Fund organized in the United States, to express China's gratitude for the association's recent fundraising efforts to aid Chinese civilians. It is reported that the panda will later be transferred by the association to the Bronx Zoo in New York to replace one that died in May of this year. The panda was hunted by twenty hunters led by Dr. Graham, president of the West China Union University Museum, in the Himalayan mountains on the border of Xikang and Tibet. It was transported from Xikang to Chengdu, and then flown to Hong Kong. The New York Zoo has now sent a representative to Hong Kong to transport the panda donated by the two ladies to the United States via clipper ship. It will likely be exhibited in various places first, and then sent to the New York Zoo. (Reuters, 14th)

Chongqing: The Jianguo Paper Mill, invested and established by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, with a capital of four million yuan for Western-style papermaking, has been subscribed, with the ministry responsible for 40% and the remainder invested by the Bank of China and private individuals. Construction of the factory building is underway. Although there are many paper mills in Sichuan Province, only Longzhang makes Western-style paper. (Havas, 14th)

### Four Banks' Industrial and Mining Loans Specify Uses

Chongqing: The 60 million yuan in industrial and mining loans from the Four Banks Joint Office will be used to encourage increased production. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has now designated coal, iron, soap, and leather as the main targets. The method is for the Fuel and Steel Management Committees to purchase coal and iron, and for the Fair Price Purchase and Sales Office to purchase soap and leather. If manufacturers are unwilling to sell, they can use them as collateral for loans. Manufacturers can choose between the two options. (Havas, 14th)

Editorial

### The Fundamental Issue of U.S.-Japan Talks

Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper discussed the discrepancies in the news regarding U.S.-Japan talks between Washington and Tokyo, stating that given the U.S. authorities' usual frankness and impartiality, there would be no reason to conceal an agreement if one were reached. According to news from Washington, Secretary of State Hull clearly denied the rumors yesterday that the U.S. and Japan had reached an agreement in principle, which shows that our view was not unfounded. Recently, Tokyo has been constantly spreading news of compromise, which is self-consolation and a smokescreen. However, the most important central issue today is not whether a compromise can be reached, but what the conditions are for the compromise. If the Japanese side can truly repent and stop all expansionist attempts, restoring the Far East to its state ten years ago, then no one would object to the reaching of such a compromise. But that is obviously impossible at present.

Reviewing the various statements made by the U.S. authorities regarding the Far East issue in the past month, they have adhered to their principles unchanged, strongly denying any progress in the negotiations, and have consistently remained silent on the views and basis of the negotiations. This is the source of greatest concern for the world. Of course, confidentiality is paramount in major diplomatic events. In order to dispel adverse effects, it is better to strictly maintain secrecy, as exemplified by the British authorities' handling of the Hess affair. However, regarding the current issue, although the U.S. side stated that the negotiations are still exploratory in nature, to test whether negotiations on Pacific issues are possible, the frequent and close contact between the two sides during this month is believed to be more than just a superficial discussion of general principles. It is undoubtedly that several major fundamental issues have been touched upon. To test whether negotiations are necessary or feasible is equivalent to testing whether the two sides can reach a consensus on fundamental opinions. Therefore, even if what is currently being conducted is exploratory, the conclusions reached will be as decisive for future development as formal negotiations. In this regard, so-called preliminary negotiations and formal negotiations may differ in form, but there is no significant difference in essence.

Under the current international situation, what any country should consider first and foremost is its own interests, which is inherently unobjectionable and should not be criticized. The United States' tough measures against Japan were triggered by Japan's conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, especially the deployment of troops in Vietnam. Therefore, what the U.S. side is considering mainly focuses on no further southward advance and withdrawal from the Axis powers. As for whether it hopes that Japan will repent and abandon the Axis powers in favor of closer ties with Britain and the United States, and is therefore willing to make some concessions, it may be too early to say at present, and it also contradicts the United States' fundamental position and promises not to adopt a policy of appeasement. However, the preliminary indications of the contents of the U.S.-Japan discussions in yesterday's United Press report from London may not be far from the truth. However, today's Far East issue is too complex. If we try to find a solution, we must make a fundamental inquiry in our understanding, and we must have comprehensive considerations in our response. The concept of short-sighted expediency will only lead to future troubles. Distorting the fundamental position of opposing aggression and upholding justice will also leave a shadow in the future of brightness and in the minds of the world. Now China's strength is rapidly increasing with the arrival of war supplies, and the Soviet Union is determined to strongly support the position of the democratic nations in the Far East. If Japan truly chooses to go to extremes (disregarding everything to expand its hegemony), then its future will only be "to end it all with death," as stated in yesterday's United Press report from Tokyo. The democratic front does not need to worry about this. The United States' implementation of embargoes and freezing of funds, in addition to the retaliatory and warning significance in its own interests, also carries a moral responsibility, which is the spirit of the declaration issued by Churchill and Roosevelt and the fundamental spirit of carrying out the war against aggression. Britain's willingness to assist Greece despite the inevitable defeat and losses, has a force that is far more compelling than the assistance that Japan's separation from the Axis powers could provide to the democratic front. Moreover, considering Japan's current situation and intentions, apart from urgently seeking to alleviate economic pressure and using its position between the two major opposing camps to assert its importance, no one can guarantee the extent of its sincerity.

If the reported Japanese proposals to stop expanding their military in Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Australia and for the U.S. to help Japan achieve peace with China are true (which is probably the contents of the Konoe letter), then it can be concluded that the U.S.-Japan talks are unlikely to be successful. China has recently declared its determination to continue fighting once again. A condition like Japanese troops withdrawing from central and southern China while Japan maintaining a special economic status in China (see the United Press London report) will only further encourage China to fight to the end. In today's Far East situation, China's attitude and direction are the most important and decisive factor, which no friendly country can afford to ignore. Moreover, even if Japan promises not to advance further south or north, it will be difficult to allay the fears of the various regions of Southeast Asia, just as the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact cannot make the Soviet Union withdraw its large army from the Far East. Therefore, we firmly believe that Hull's claim that the talks have made no progress is true. It is said that tomorrow is the deadline for the exploratory talks. If the original views of the two sides remain unchanged, if the side bent on expansion has no sincere intention of repenting, and if it is only delaying time in order to make arrangements, then the past month has already been an unnecessary waste of time, and there is no need to continue. As for the future of the Far East, if we allow it to continue developing as it was a month ago, then apart from the ambitious, no one has reason to be pessimistic.

### Contents of Talks Between Ping-chi Committee and Hong Kong Bankers in Hong Kong Are Important

Close Financial Ties Established Between China, Britain, and the United States, Preventing Escape of Funds at Home and Abroad, and Completely Eliminating Shanghai's Black Market for Foreign Exchange

Chongqing: According to well-informed sources here, the contents of the talks between the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee and bankers from Shanghai and Hong Kong in Hong Kong are very important, mainly involving: (1) using exchange equalization work to establish close financial ties between China, Britain, and the United States; (2) encouraging exports to replenish the Exchange Equalization Fund, providing foreign exchange for the import of essential goods at any time, but this must also distinguish between urgency, and it is proposed that Britain and the United States restrict the issuance of export permits. Britain has now issued an order to prohibit all exports to China except those passing through Burma, and China has only approved sixteen types of goods to be imported through the Yunnan-Burma Road; (3) intensifying the freezing of funds in China, Britain, and the United States, preventing the escape of funds at home and abroad; (4) finding ways to completely eliminate Shanghai's black market for foreign exchange. Financial circles here believe that after the implementation of various measures, the legal tender will not be difficult to rise to three and a half pence. (Havas, 14th)

### Foreign Exchange Management Committee Established

Chongqing: The Foreign Exchange Management Committee has been established. The National Government previously appointed Minister Kung to concurrently serve as the chairman. The internal structure includes one secretary-general and two deputy secretaries-general, under whom there are four sections. The first section is responsible for reviewing foreign exchange requests for imports and remittances from government agencies; the second section is responsible for collecting foreign exchange from exports, remittances from overseas Chinese, and collecting gold and silver; the third section is responsible for allocating loans and freezing funds; the fourth section is responsible for general affairs. The secretary-general, deputy secretaries-general, and personnel for each section have all been announced. In the future, the committee's work will closely coordinate with the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee to jointly implement the government's foreign exchange management policy. (14th)

### Iqe Joo League Tugs-zsak Prays at Mausoleum of Yellow Emperor

Yulin: Tuvshin Gereltsogt, the Tugs-zsak of the Iqe Joo League banner, has returned from Yubei and has now arrived in Yulin. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has sent an investigator, Chung Lu-en, to personally escort him. After Tugs-zsak met with Deng Baoshan and Zhu Shouguang in Yulin, he headed north to return to his banner. During Tugs-zsak's return from Xi'an to Yulin, he personally prayed at the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor in central China, with a solemn ceremony. It is said that Tugs-zsak is the first Mongol prince to pray at the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor, and Tugs-zsak is also a Jilang responsible for the offering at the Genghis Khan mausoleum. His praying at the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor has great significance. (13th)

### Red Army Gains Initiative on Central Front; 16 German Divisions Annihilated

Corpses Litter Bryansk Region; German Stuka Dive Bombers Bombing Leningrad

German War Report Claims Breakthrough in St. Petersburg Defenses

United Press, Moscow, 14th: News from the front yesterday reported that the Red Army annihilated twelve German divisions attacking in Bryansk and destroyed four German divisions attempting to attack Kiev. News reports published a statement by General Duller Lossdorf, stating that four German divisions were annihilated in the Kiev conflict in February, and the operation is continuing. General Dulles said that the fighting reached its peak from August 8 to August 14, when the German army added the 44th and 95th divisions to the 71st and 299th divisions. A reporter at the front said, "The German army also implemented Stalin's scorched earth policy when withdrawing from the Bryansk region." The reporter said, "The German army destroyed bridges, burned towns, and slaughtered all living things. At night, the fire lit up the sky, as the forests and towns along several miles were burned by them. Thousands of German corpses were buried in a public pit. The battlefield was covered with destroyed tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft. Near the village of M, the German motorcycle corps abandoned valuable maps, including a map of Moscow." According to the latest official news, fierce fighting is continuing in the Smolensk region. The German army is counterattacking in individual areas, attempting to recapture this position. The Soviet Union has stopped the German offensive and, after repeated counterattacks, has captured the village of Stivolov.

United Press, Berlin, 14th: Reliable German sources stated yesterday that General Leeb's northern forces have intensified the encirclement of Leningrad's defensive positions. The German Air Force is constantly bombing the Soviet lines, clearing the way for ground troops. These reliable sources said that Leningrad experienced the most severe air raid on Friday morning. It is claimed that German Stuka dive bombers scattered "whirlwind fire" on the outer positions of the city.

Haitong News Agency, Fuehrer Headquarters, 14th: The German High Command announced that the German army is continuing to advance on the Eastern Front. Elite German troops have passed through the Leningrad fortified line and charged into enemy positions. German General Schobert was killed in action on the Eastern Front on the 12th of this month.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 14th: The German High Command announced today that the German army has broken through St. Petersburg's strong defensive works and charged into enemy positions.

### Amid Tense Situation on Eastern Front, British Air Force Aids Soviet Union

Reuters, London, 14th: In recent weeks, British aircraft piloted by Soviet aviators have been active on the front lines. Germany is now using its latest Messerschmitt Me 109F fighters in the offensive against Leningrad. Although it rained heavily yesterday, the air war continued, with reportedly heavy German losses.

Reuters, London, 14th: A Reuters air force correspondent claims that it has been announced today that a large squadron of the British Air Force has arrived in the Soviet Union, providing direct assistance to the Soviet Air Force at a time of heightened tension on the Eastern Front. Regarding Prime Minister Churchill's statement in Parliament last week that hundreds of British warplanes had been sent to the Soviet Union, and that some had already arrived, there is now reason to believe that this squadron may be entirely composed of fighters, including all combat and management personnel. The exact details are, of course, inconvenient to disclose during wartime. At the beginning of the Battle of France, each British Air Force combat squadron consisted of two teams, but this has since been increased. There is also no information about who is leading the squadron to the Soviet Union. The speed at which the British Air Force operates on the Soviet front lines may be a decisive factor in the victory of the war in the region.

Reuters, London, 14th: First Sea Lord Alexander said in Nottingham today that there are many ways to provide naval assistance to the Soviet Union, but he did not intend to provide details in order to avoid being used by the enemy. The Soviet Union is our ally, and we will provide it with assistance in every possible form without reservation.

### Military and Civilians Resolve to Defend to the Death: Kiev Becomes a Strong Fortress

Reuters, 14th Dispatch, London: Recent Soviet communiqués state that fierce battles are occurring along the front lines. It is also stated that on the night of September 12th, Kiev was bombarded by the Soviets. According to Reuters in Moscow, after the capture of Chernihiv (approximately 80 miles northeast of Kiev) in northern Ukraine by the German forces, Kiev becomes an even more important location to secure the western front. The area between Kiev and Chernihiv, specifically the southern Polesia region, is mostly forest and swamp, bordering the Ukrainian steppe. This area receives heavy rainfall, and the rivers are currently very full. Kiev itself remains confident that it will not fall to the enemy. In early August, enemy forces had approached Kiev but were eventually repelled. This experience has instilled a determination to defend the city among the troops and residents. Battles have been ongoing for several weeks on the roads leading to Kiev, but under the guidance of technicians and military experts, the 800,000 residents of Kiev have worked to turn Kiev and its surrounding areas into a large fortress during the war.

### Fierce Resistance Encountered on All Fronts: German Strategic Objectives Difficult to Achieve

Reuters, 14th Dispatch, London: The special correspondent for Reuters in Moscow reports that the situation in the Smolensk area has stabilized after the German forces attempted to break through the Soviet lines and advance toward Moscow but were defeated by General Timoshenko. The initiative has now shifted to the Soviet forces. General Timoshenko's troops are numerous and well-equipped. While the Germans are concentrating in the south and in the Leningrad area, the Soviets are launching counterattacks in the Smolensk area. The Soviet side believes the situation is very satisfactory. The Germans are currently reinforcing the areas they occupy with artillery and machine guns, but the Soviet forces have still made significant progress on this front. At the same time, the Soviet forces are increasing their activity in the areas slightly to the north to coordinate with the Soviet forces in Smolensk, aiming to prevent the Germans from using the main railway lines behind their lines to transport troops into the Leningrad area. Leningrad also has a large garrison, and its residents are determined to resist, so it is expected to hold out for as long as Odessa. The weather has been unfavorable since the beginning of September, but there are still unprecedented large-scale battles taking place south and southwest of Leningrad. Newly established German airfields have been attacked and destroyed by the Soviet forces, and the Soviet Baltic Fleet has also inflicted heavy blows on the German forces. The strength of the Soviet military is evident here. Both soldiers and civilians are deeply confident that the German forces will not be able to capture Leningrad. Now the German forces have opened another route, advancing from southeast of Gomel. The Soviet forces attempted to directly attack Bryansk half a month ago, but their tank columns were mostly destroyed, resulting in failure. Therefore, they have opened a new route to try again. After the fall of Chernihiv, if the German forces can occupy the salient points of the Dnieper River and the Desna River, Kiev will be at risk of encirclement. However, the Desna River flows through swampy areas, and in the current climate, it is impossible to advance to Kiev from the northeast, and crossing the Desna River is also not easy.

### American Ship Injured by Bombing on the Banks of the Suez Canal

Washington Announces Hit by Shrapnel; Bombing of the "Steel Mariner" Confirmed as German Aircraft

Reuters, 14th Dispatch, Washington: The State Department announced that on Thursday, the American-flagged ship "Archisan" was slightly damaged by shrapnel during an air raid in the town of Suez. No casualties were reported among the crew. The American authorities are currently investigating the details. This ship is owned by the American Hawaiian Company and travels between the United States and the Red Sea. The American Embassy in Cairo reported to the State Department that the ship was hit by shrapnel from a shell, and some of the ship's plates were pierced by fragments. The ship left New York on July 19th, arrived in Port Sudan on September 5th, and departed Suez on the 8th. The crew consists of thirty-eight people, including thirty-six Americans, one Briton, and one Dutchman. As to whether the shrapnel came from anti-aircraft guns, aerial torpedoes, or cannons fired from aircraft, the report did not specify. The State Department stated that personnel at the American Embassy in Cairo, who are not military experts, said that these fragments might be bomb fragments rather than shell fragments, but this is not certain.

Reuters, 14th Dispatch, Washington: According to the testimony of Second Mate Sujia of the American ship "Steel Mariner" in Suez on Friday, the ship was sunk by a German aircraft in the Red Sea on the night of September 9th. The aircraft was most likely a Junkers Ju 88, and it was definitely a German aircraft, not an Italian one. He also said that the night had bright moonlight, and it was not difficult to distinguish the flag flown by the "Steel Mariner."

### Australian Aircraft Production: 1,000 Aircraft Can Be Produced by the End of the Year

### United States Intensifies Efforts to Supplement National Defense Programs

Transportation to the Far North Sky Can Be Reached in Three Days; Air Route Opened Between the United States and West Africa

Reuters, 14th Dispatch, Washington: Government officials revealed the following developments in national defense programs: (1) Army air transport is being used to accelerate the delivery of national defense supplies to American outposts in Alaska. The supplies and equipment needed by the far north base can now be transported from the United States to Alaska in three days, instead of the several weeks required by water transport. (2) Pan American Airways is planning to establish new flight bases and bomber transition lines in Africa to counter actions from Dakar, West Africa, to the Western Hemisphere. (3) Bases are currently being built in Monrovia, Liberia, West Africa, and Léopoldville, Belgian Congo. This will be a new route for delivering American-made bombers to the Soviet Union and British forces in the Middle East. Pan American Airways will operate the route from Miami to Léopoldville using government equipment. (4) The Navy Department has recently joined the effort to allocate national defense orders to various factories. The department has established a special office to handle order allocation. (5) The large-caliber shells manufactured by Pullman Standard Car Manufacturing Company have now been completed. A few months ago, the factory only needed one warehouse, but now it has rapidly become a shell manufacturing plant. (6) A new aluminum plant will be built in Tacoma, Washington, producing 20 million pounds of aluminum per year, bringing the total annual aluminum production in the United States to 113 million pounds. The construction cost of this plant is $3.9 million, and it has been approved by the National Defense Factories Association. (7) Manganese plants owned by the National Factories Association will be built in two locations in the United States, so that the annual manganese production in the United States can reach 27.4 million pounds.

Reuters, 14th Dispatch, Washington: A new commercial air route will be established between the United States and Southwest Africa. The U.S. Civil Aeronautics Authority has been authorized by President Roosevelt to issue an operating permit. Aircraft on this route will travel between Miami, Florida, and a location in Southwest Africa.

### Another American 30,000-Ton Battleship Completed

Two-Ocean Navy Program Expected to Be Completed Early

Havas, 14th Dispatch, Washington: The newly built American 35,000-ton battleship "Massachusetts" has been completed and is scheduled to be launched on the 23rd of this month. Its completion date is seven months ahead of schedule. Navy personnel believe that if shipbuilding work can continue at this pace, the "Two-Ocean Navy" can be completed in 1944, two years ahead of schedule. After the "Massachusetts" is incorporated into the fleet, the United States will have as many as nineteen battleships in active service. The ship cost $75 million and is equipped with nine 16-inch guns and twenty 5-inch guns, making it the most powerful battleship of modern times, with a speed of 27 knots per hour.

### British Military Experts Arrive in Turkey

Offer Contributions to Turkey Based on Battlefield Experience

Reuters, 14th Dispatch, Ankara: British military experts David and Morgan have arrived here at the invitation of the Turkish Ministry of National Defense and will provide advice to the Turkish government based on their battlefield experience over the past two years.

Havas, 13th Dispatch, Turkish Capital: The chief representative of the German economic delegation, Klodius, visited Foreign Minister Saracoğlu today for two discussions.

### British and Soviet Troops Celebrate Together in Iran

First Batch of Arrested German Nationals Handed Over to British and Soviet Military Custody

Reuters, 14th Dispatch, Tehran: A unit of British Indian troops, led by the commander of the British advance team, formally visited the Soviet forces stationed in Qazvin yesterday. The British Minister to Iran and the Army Attaché also went there and were received by the Soviet commander. Within a week, the Soviet commander will also go to Hamadan to return the visit to the British forces.

Reuters, 14th Dispatch, Tehran: The first batch of eighty Germans in Iran left here by train on Friday. Seventy-two of them were handed over to British military custody, and the rest were handed over to Soviet military custody. Another 170 Germans will also be handed over to the British and Soviet sides within days. However, not all the Germans demanded by the British and Soviets may be handed over, as many of them have escaped from Iran or taken refuge in the mountains.

### American Sailors Strike, Demanding Wartime Compensation

Service on the Atlantic-West Indies Route Halted

Reuters, 14th Dispatch, New York: Three ships loaded with supplies for the establishment of American defense bases in Bermuda and the West Indies were scheduled to depart yesterday afternoon but were temporarily canceled because the North American International Seafarers' Union demanded full war compensation and announced a strike. The crew members left the ships, preventing them from departing on time. The union secretary, Creskin, said that all ships sailing to Axis or Allied ports will be affected by this labor unrest. We do not object to transporting war materials to the UK, but since the Nazis are now indiscriminately attacking ships regardless of location, we have to protect ourselves. The shipowners have not yet made any moves to negotiate.

### Chinese Army Continues to Suppress the Enemy in the Dayun Mountains, Recaptures Strongholds such as Heshang Village

Chinese Army in Northern Hubei Attacks Japanese Positions with Gains; Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Raids Fenlingdu, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Japanese

Chongqing Military News: (1) A certain unit of the Chinese Army in Northern Jiangxi raided the Japanese forces in the Louxiake area of the Ruiwu Road on the evening of the 8th, achieving some gains and thoroughly destroying Zhoujiaqiao.

Dayun Mountain is a Natural Guerrilla Base

Miluo: Dayun Mountain is the western branch of the Mufu Mountains, running through the eastern shore of Dongting Lake, in the middle of the Yueyang and Linxiang counties. With a circumference of more than 200 li and 72 peaks, equal in number to the peaks of Mount Heng in Southern Yue, it is a natural model guerrilla base. During the Northern Hunan Campaign years ago, General Shao Jiang Zongyi of the 79th Army pursued the Japanese army and climbed to the summit several times. Liang Gaisan and Zongyi once wrote a quatrain. Zongyi's quatrain says, "The water and cloud village on the shore of Dongting Lake, the people are scattered and dead after the disaster. After the battle, the mouths of slaves were first stationed, and the flying rain filled the mountains, passing through the Double Ninth Festival." This time, thousands of Japanese soldiers were injured and invaded the mountain, but in less than four days, they were once again captured by the Chinese army. According to a certain officer who first entered the mountain speaking to a reporter by telephone, the scene in the mountains after the war was no different from the previous poem. Documents seized from the Japanese years ago confirmed that the Japanese viewed the Dayun Mountains in northern Hunan as being no less important than the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi. The Zhongtiao Mountains were the Japanese appendix, and the Dayun Mountains were the Japanese tonsils. Gaining them both would be enough to control the Japanese's lives. (Dispatch of the 13th)

A Certain Place in Southern Anhui: Thousands of Japanese soldiers from Wuhu and Wanzhi attacked the Chinese troops in the Xinhezhuang area on the 9th.

### Japanese Army in North China Implementing Invasion of Communist Army

Attempt to Defeat the Communist Forces on the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Within the Year; Fierce Battles Have Begun But Are Being Blocked Everywhere

Chongqing: The Xinhua Daily, the organ of the Communist Party, stated today that 100,000 Japanese and puppet troops, in order to defeat the Chinese Communist forces on the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei border within this year, began an unprecedentedly large-scale mopping-up operation on August 14, but were blocked everywhere. The Xinhua Daily stated that documents seized by the Communist Eighteenth Group Army during the fighting revealed that the Japanese army had drafted a "April Mopping-up" plan. The area originally had 50,000 Japanese soldiers, and then 50,000 more were sent as reinforcements, hoping to launch a fierce attack on the border area from five directions, namely Lingqiu to the north of Fangshan, Zhuoxian to the east of Zhengding and Shijiazhuang, Qingcheng (transliteration) to the south, and Wutai to the west. The Communist Party predicts that although the attacks by the Japanese army on all sides will be blocked, there will soon be even greater blood battles and terrible massacres.

### The Concession Authorities Decide to Monitor Prices

### Prices Cannot Be Raised Arbitrarily, and Must Be Reduced Automatically

The various commodity prices in Shanghai have been rising one after another due to the surge in the black market exchange rate and the soaring gold prices. However, since the collapse of the gold market, apart from a slight drop in rice managed by the Public Works Department, the remaining goods have stubbornly maintained their new prices and have not been reduced proportionally. This has resulted in citizens only facing the threat of price increases, without enjoying any price decreases. The authorities in the two concessions, seeing the merchants valuing profit over righteousness and disregarding people's livelihood, have decided to adopt strict monitoring measures in the future. The rise and fall of selling prices must be based on market conditions and the impact on the industry itself. Prices cannot be raised arbitrarily without automatic reductions, so as to avoid increasing the burden on citizens.

### Soviet Ships Exporting Military Supplies
### Customs Denies, But Admits to Carrying Coal and Cotton Fabrics

A spokesman for the Jianghai Customs recently stated that regarding the two Soviet ships that set sail from Shanghai to Vladivostok last Tuesday and Friday, there were rumors circulating that they were carrying wartime military supplies for the use of the Soviet government. The spokesman denied this. However, the spokesman admitted that the two Soviet ships were only carrying coal, cotton fabrics, and ordinary commercial goods. The customs spokesman also did not specify the names of the Soviet ships, possibly referring to the *Soviet Tuohao* and *Food Industry Hao*. However, according to foreign reports, the *Soviet Tuohao* and *Kodafv Hao* will sail to various locations in Manila in the near future.

### Japanese Flagship *Izumo* Departs Shanghai

### Carrying Shimada to Japan

The Japanese flagship *Izumo*, which had been berthed at the Pujiang Central Wharf in Shanghai, suddenly sailed out of the Songkou port the other day.

### *Jin Tai Zi* Ship Attempts to Sail to Wenzhou
### Suddenly Detained by the Japanese

### Declaration to Sail to Hong Kong Revealed
### Negotiations with Foreign Businesses Have Not Yet Secured Release

The coastal ports of Zhejiang and Fujian were blockaded by the Japanese Navy in mid-July last year. More than two months have passed, and shipping between Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian has been cut off. Last month, foreign ships *Da Xin* and *Da Li* attempted to sail to Gu'aotou. As previously reported, the trial voyages of these two small ships were also secret operations and not made public. Furthermore, the Jianghai Customs is still prohibiting clearance for Zhejiang and Fujian ports. However, small ships have recently been secretly sailing to eastern Zhejiang. Now, Yuanfeng Customs Brokerage, last month, chartered a small foreign ship named *Jin Tai Zi* (Cambay Prince) of 375 tons in Hong Kong through Aik Ocean Shipping Company. The ship loaded more than 2,400 bags of foreign rice in Hong Kong and arrived in Shanghai on the 29th of last month. It was unloaded at the Jiangmao Wharf in Pudong. After the foreign rice was unloaded, the ship was handled by Kangtai Customs Brokerage, Dachang Shenzhuang, No. 102, Central Huibuilding, which took over the export cargo and secretly loaded it. On the 8th of this month, it declared to customs that it would sail to Hong Kong and was scheduled to depart the next evening (9th). Unexpectedly, the plan was leaked and discovered by the Japanese Navy Maritime Police. Before the ship could set sail, it was detained and inspected by Japanese soldiers. The ship was loaded with more than 2,000 pieces of gauze and had 11 passengers. After strict interrogation by the Japanese soldiers, the passengers admitted that they were traveling to Wenzhou. Therefore, the Japanese military police believed that there was conclusive evidence that the ship was secretly sailing to Wenzhou. The ship was placed under strict surveillance and investigation. After the company learned that the ship had an accident, it immediately sought the help of foreign businesses to negotiate and find ways to get it released. A week has passed, but there have been no results. The ship is still being detained at the Longmao Wharf. It is reported that Kangtai Customs Brokerage is jointly operated by Sun Bofu, Tong Ziquan, Ren Changlin, and others. Since the ship had an accident, Ren has avoided appearing. The company's terms for reporting and loading cargo for customers are very harsh. If the ship does not leave the wharf, a 20% water fee will be charged for future customs returns. If the ship leaves the wharf but cannot leave Wusongkou, a 30% water fee will be charged. If the ship leaves Wusongkou but cannot reach its destination and returns, a 50% water fee will be charged. Therefore, although the ship has been detained, the company's losses are minimal, while the customer's losses are significant.

### More Than 1,000 Members of the Shanghai Sichuan Guild Pay Tribute to Wang Dan Kui Yesterday

### The Ceremony Was Extremely Solemn and Reverent; He Was Posthumously Honored as Duke Wenk

Mr. Wang Dankui, a respected elder statesman from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, passed away on the 23rd day of the fifth lunar month of this year at the age of 82. Friends respected his virtue and integrity, and more than 30 organizations, including the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fellow Association and the World Red Swastika Society, initiated a memorial service to express their condolences. Since the preparations began, everything has been proceeding smoothly. A memorial service was held yesterday afternoon at 2 PM in the grand auditorium on the sixth floor of the Pudong Fellow Association. More than 1,500 people attended, including Yuan Xiluo, Huang Jingwan, and Jin Qiyuan.

### The Grand Memorial Service

Wen Lanting, Shen Qiquan, Tang Wenzhi, Shen Xinqing, and Zhang Yunbo were elected as the presidium. The auditorium was decorated simply and solemnly. In the center hung a portrait of Mr. Wang, who appeared spirited despite his advanced age. On both sides hung plain elegiac couplets presented by various circles. Several bouquets of fresh flowers and simple sacrifices of fruits and vegetables were placed on the altar, along with lit white candles. Several wreaths were placed in front of the stage. At exactly 2 PM, mourning music began to play. Wen Lanting delivered the opening remarks, followed by the memorial ceremony. Everyone stood in solemn respect as the chairman offered incense, wine, and flowers. The assembly bowed three times and read the eulogy. Lu Zhuoqiao reported on Mr. Wang's life, divided into (1) Family History, (2) Scholarship, (3) Ambitions and Actions, (4) Achievements in the Court, (5) Accomplishments in Retirement, (6) Civil Service Examination Success, (7) Official Rank, (8) Writings, (9) Age, and (10) Descendants. Yao Minghui, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Tang Moubo, Zhang Lancui and others delivered condolences. Organizations such as the Songtao Fellow Association, the World Red Swastika Society, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fellow Association, the Chengming College of Arts, and Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, and Qi Fellow Associations, the Chongming Fellow Association and other groups offered sacrifices in separate groups.

### Tang's Eulogy

On the 14th day of the 9th month of the 30th year of the Republic of China, in the year of Xin Si, Shen Enfu, Tang Wenzhi, Shen Zhou, Xia Yueao, Dai Sigong, Huang Yunshu, Min Huan, Zhu Dechuan, Yuan Xiluo, Yu Zhongtang, Lu Xiuhao, Gao Xie, Dai Kekuan, Jin Chengwang, Zhang Zhihe, Jin [blank] Yuan, Jia Fengzhen, Li Shilong, Yao Minghui, Xia Benli, Wu Bangzhen, Xiang Zhenfang, Ni Guangyao, Hu Duanxing, Zhang [blank] Yan, Pan Guangyu, Cheng Hao, Shen Siqi, Shi Tongren, Ge Cun [blank], Sun Deyu, and Zhou Chengxin, residing in Shanghai and returning to Songtao, respectfully offer sacrifices to the spirit of Mr. Wang Dan Kui, saying: Alas, tracing back the lineage of the Du family, its origins are distant and its flow is long. Endowed with the spirit of Fu and Yu, its jade-like qualities are hidden and treasured. Mr. Wang was devoted to filial piety and brotherly love, with broad knowledge and a strong memory, indeed commendable. He was respectful and gentle, rarely laughing and always solemn. Recalling his early years, he attained high honors in the imperial examination, how he aspired to the heavens and soared. But the smog of rebellion obscured the sky, lamenting the thorny path filled with dangers. Serving his parents, he fled to Bao Dili, then returned alone to the capital to assist the imperial court. Observing the cycle of prosperity and decline, he expanded his grand strategy for governing the world, embracing extraordinary measures and sounding the alarm, spreading beneficial commercial policies, establishing chambers of commerce to facilitate business, and connecting distant lands. He forged ties with overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, saying that only Mr. Wang could alleviate their worries. He entrusted him with the most important matters, but alas, he was deceived and betrayed. Furthermore, longing for home, he was forced to live a recluse life by the riverside, washing his mouth and using a stone as a pillow. Mr. Wang was upright and impartial, hoping for timely rain to nourish the land. Overseeing the finances of Zhejiang, he eliminated corruption and established a clean and tight system, vehemently protesting against road administration, lamenting the blockage and destruction. He foresaw hidden dangers, and indeed, dikes collapsed and cliffs crumbled. Alas, lamenting that Mr. Wang did not serve again, how can we comfort the people? Managing the vast floods of Huai and Xiang, he initiated the plan to guide the Huai River. He rode on sleds and struggled, nearly drowning in the middle of the water. Coordinating the dredging of the Zhenze Lake, he exhausted his efforts and ingenuity. Mr. Wang was tireless in his love for others, providing disaster relief in his hometown. Supporting the sickbed and groaning, he still continued to give generously. Grieving over the hardships of the nation, his sorrow lingered and could not be forgotten. Daily, he looked up and wiped away tears, hoping for a clear world. Although knowing to hide his talents and await opportunities, he only appealed to save our four directions. Wise men are fading, who shall be our model? For thousands of years, my thoughts linger. Alas, may you enjoy the sacrifice! (Written by Tang Wenzhi)

### Liquor Merchants Request Exemption from

### Bottled Liquor Stamp Tax

It is heard that the Shanghai liquor industry, due to the French Concession Public Works Bureau's recent promulgation of regulations on alcohol and beverage factories and distilleries, is widely collecting bottled liquor stamp tax from members of the trade association. They have exchanged views, believing that the liquor tax is a national tax and is different in nature from other local taxes. The repackaged bottled liquor sold by member stores is repackaged from large containers of goods. This is a commercial packaging act, not self-made, and cannot be called a factory. Yesterday, they jointly sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau, requesting that it revoke the order and exempt them from reapplying stamp tax.

### Silver Association Implements Today

### Regular Exchange of Negotiable Instruments

### All Exchange Banks and Agent Banks

### Are Referred to as Special Contract Banks

The Shanghai Banking Joint Reserve Committee, referring to the regular exchange system of the London Clearing House and using the collection method as a system for unifying negotiable instrument exchange, will implement it from today (Monday). All original exchange banks and entrusted exchange banks will be referred to as special contract banks.

### Symbol

All special contract banks should print various negotiable instruments in the future. The account number "50" of the clearing house should be printed on the negotiable instruments in large red double-hook Arabic numerals, surrounded by a single-line circle. This pattern should be printed in the lower right corner of Chinese negotiable instruments and in the upper right corner of English negotiable instruments. However, each bank may freely decide to print it in other appropriate locations on the negotiable instrument. All negotiable instruments entrusted to this Joint Reserve Committee for collection should be stamped on the front by the collecting bank.

### Stamp

The "Entrusted to Shanghai Negotiable Instrument Clearing House for Collection" stamp issued by the association should be stamped in green ink, indicating the date and with the number 50 below. This stamp is limited to payment instruments of special contract banks and payment checks of the association. It has the same effect as endorsement and parallel lines for withdrawal. The original scheduled exchange will be discontinued from today. "Delivery of Instruments", "Return of Instruments", and "Transfer", and "Balance Supplement" have already been issued to all special contract banks in Circulars No. 173 and No. 173 for compliance.

### Three Major American Gasoline Companies

### Further Restrict Oil Use

### All Gas Stations Close Early at 8 PM

### Cars Must Be Registered Before Refueling Is Allowed

The *Times* reports that Asia Petroleum has announced further restrictions on the consumption of gasoline by cars, stipulating that all gas stations in various sections of the city will close at 8 PM. The other two gasoline companies have also taken the same steps. In addition, gas stations will only sell gasoline to regular customers. According to Texaco's regulations, car owners must register at a certain gas station and can only obtain the required gasoline from that station. Recently, Asia Petroleum warned its customers that the quantity of gasoline needed from each "Shell" gas station should not exceed the average quantity of the previous few months. In addition to regular customers, gasoline sales, whether paid in cash or on credit, will be suspended. The Mobil Oil Company also uses this system to allocate gasoline.

### Cash Purchase of Oil

The only difference is that credit sales are stopped, but cash purchases can continue. Cars must also be registered at the gas station. If a car's oil consumption exceeds the prescribed allocation, the gas station will stop supplying until the first day of the following month. The oil companies claim that these steps are taken not because of a shortage of gasoline reserves or reduced sources, but to prevent speculators from hoarding. This hoarding can harm ordinary car owners because it can increase prices. With the implementation of these measures, the price of oil is expected to fall. In addition, gasoline, as an imported item, can obtain foreign exchange at a preferential rate of National Currency $8.82 per US dollar, so gasoline prices are expected to fall. However, responsible parties say that this development is unlikely in the short term.

Recently, various large and small cinemas in Shanghai have been repeatedly threatened by gangsters throwing bombs and extorting "protection money". Although three gang members were arrested in Pudong a month ago, there are still a large number of these gangsters at large, and they continue their terrorist extortion activities. The authorities in both concessions are paying close attention to this. After much investigation, the leader of the terror group, nicknamed "Little Korean," was arrested in Western Shanghai.

### From Freezing to Management

### The Before and After of Black Market Foreign Exchange Changes (Part 1)

### Prelude

Since the United States froze Chinese and Japanese funds, followed by the Junior Council's management of the black market, with a gap of less than two months in between, the foreign exchange market has been turbulent and unpredictable, changing in an instant. These novel events are not only unprecedented changes in Chinese financial history but are also rare and unheard of in the black markets of Eastern and Southeastern Europe and South American countries. In view of this, the author will record the changes in the black market during this stage and the causes and consequences before and after, so that readers can get a glimpse of the whole picture.

### (1) The Status of Shanghai's Foreign Exchange Market

The establishment of a foreign exchange market is used to settle international lending relationships. Therefore, the level of the exchange rate completely depends on whether the international balance of payments can maintain equilibrium for a long period of time. Although the Shanghai foreign exchange market has added political and military factors to the fluctuations in the exchange rate due to changes in the environment, analyzing the changes in the exchange rate over time shows that the surplus or deficit of foreign exchange receipts and payments is still the basic key to determining the exchange rate. What is the situation of Shanghai's receipts and payments? Due to the lack of reliable statistics from all parties, the actual situation of the entire receipts and payments cannot be investigated. However, if we look at Shanghai's import and export trade, which accounts for the main part of international receipts and payments, Shanghai's foreign exchange receipts and payments undoubtedly cannot maintain equilibrium. Its economic capacity is not enough to prevent the exchange rate from falling. Taking this year's trade situation as an example, according to the national currency value of the monthly trade deficit in Shanghai issued by the Customs, the total has reached more than 988.8 million yuan in national currency over the past seven months, with an average monthly deficit of 140 million yuan in national currency. That is to say, the Shanghai foreign exchange market must lose an average of 140 million yuan in national currency per month. Where will this huge monthly deficit be compensated from? There is no doubt about that. In the past, the escape of world capital to Shanghai was only a momentary matter. Remittances from overseas Chinese back to China were subject to quota restrictions due to foreign exchange controls in various places. These two sources of foreign exchange cannot be regarded as regular income, and their amount is insignificant to the entire market. In the past, the Chinese government adopted a policy of trying its best to maintain the Shanghai foreign exchange market. It made many efforts to maintain the black market exchange rate. The Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund, for example, was completely spent on the Shanghai black market. However, the black market is ultimately a bottomless loophole. Unlimited maintenance would only increase the government's burden. The government had to tighten its grip on the Shanghai foreign exchange market. Therefore, the Shanghai foreign exchange market was neither economically self-sufficient nor supported by the government, and its status became increasingly fragile. The continuous decline in the exchange rate was an inevitable trend.

### (2) Prelude to the Freezing of Funds

Since the expansion of the European War in April 1940, the United States began to implement its freezing measures. The first to bear the brunt was the freezing of funds in the United States of Denmark and Norway. Subsequently, as the German-occupied areas gradually expanded, the number of countries frozen also increased day by day. As of June 14, there were a total of 22 countries. At that time, the United States did not have an immediate intention to freeze funds in the Far East. However, rumors about freezing Chinese and Japanese funds came one after another, and reports were endless. The reflection in the hearts of the people of Shanghai was that the freezing of foreign exchange had the possibility of expanding to the Far East at any time. The tense situation caused by the freezing of foreign exchange was also in danger of breaking out at any time. Therefore, the foreign exchange market at that time was unstable and full of dangers. The most prominent were four: (1) The return of escaping funds. Those with foreign exchange urgently needed to exchange it back for legal tender to prepare early. (2) Import settlement was sluggish. Importers feared the constraints of freezing. (3) Foreign merchants and banks sold off. Banks such as Zhengjin, Mitsubishi, and Mitsui had a large number of foreign exchange positions to sell off. According to market estimates, the total was about 10 million yuan to avoid the constraints of freezing. (4) Foreign banks restricted forward foreign exchange trading. British and American banks, fearing that a freezing order would be issued, would face commercial disputes with frozen countries due to the fulfillment of contracts, so they were willing to restrict forward transactions slightly. Therefore, judging from the actions of various parties at that time, the United States was still hesitating about freezing Chinese and Japanese funds. However, the people of Shanghai had already paid close attention and expected that it would be realized sooner or later.

### (3) Abnormal Phenomena After the Freezing

The United States froze Chinese and Japanese funds. As expected by all parties, the U.S. President signed an executive order on the evening of July 15, effective from the 26th. The freezing measures were based on the amended Tianjin Country Freezing Funds Regulations of June 14 of this year, and detailed rules for implementing the freezing were issued in the form of general notes. The general notes issued by the United States for freezing Chinese and Japanese funds totaled 16, from No. 54 to No. 69. One was given to the Dutch Merchant Bank of China in Kobe, one was given to the Chinese government's agencies in the United States, two were given to Chinese and Japanese expatriates in the United States, two were given to American banks and Chinese and Japanese banks in the United States, four were given to Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai, and six were given to Hong Kong, Hawaii, and the Philippines. Regarding those abroad, let's not discuss them for the time being. The four notes given by the United States to Shanghai were Nos. 58, 59, 60, and 61. Note No. 58 stipulated that from June 14, 1941, people doing business in China could engage in normal import and export trade, but could not manage trade on behalf of people from blocked countries outside China and people living in the Northeast. The conditions for applying for foreign exchange must be legitimate import and export, and the value of the import and export must be equal to the amount of foreign exchange applied for, and must comply with the various terms and conditions stipulated in this note. Note No. 59 authorized 14 foreign banks in Shanghai to engage in foreign exchange business and to assist import and export trade between China (excluding the Northeast) and the United States, the American Republic, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch Indies. However, the aforementioned banks may not request the transfer or withdrawal of frozen U.S. dollar deposits. Before the banks issue letters of credit, accept or pay bills of exchange, or make other payments and transfers due to import and export trade, the import trade must meet the following conditions: (1) This trade must be legitimate import and export, and the value of the import and export must be equivalent to the amount of foreign exchange applied for. (2) This import and export must comply with the terms and conditions stipulated in this note. Note No. 60 specifically allowed the Chinese government and the Central Bank to accept requests from the people to transfer or transfer their frozen deposits or securities to domestic banks in the name of the government or the Central Bank. Note No. 61 allowed the Chinese Transportation Bank, the Chinese Farmers Bank, and the Third Bank to engage in foreign exchange trading, with the same provisions as Note No. 59.

The British freezing order for Chinese funds was formally announced by the British government on July 29. The freezing measures were to order British banks in China to freeze all pound sterling deposits, bonds, and cash, etc., held in China or branches outside China. They would continue to provide assistance for import and export trade between China and the pound sterling group areas and authorized the Shanghai HSBC, McCallie, and Yuli banks to handle applications for the supply of pound sterling drafts.

The British and American freezing measures for Chinese funds have been roughly described above. The British freezing measures are very strict. However, since the British controlled the pound sterling exchange rate, the relationship between the pound sterling and the Shanghai foreign exchange market was not very large. Therefore, the impact of the British freezing on Shanghai was also very limited. What was the impact of the American freezing on Shanghai? This is what this article should examine. Before the U.S. freezing of funds was announced, the psychology of the people of Shanghai regarding the freezing was that U.S. dollar deposits could not be freely used, and the Shanghai free market would no longer exist. At that time, those who sold foreign exchange came one after another. The U.S. dollar fell to around $5.50 but still lacked buyers. After the U.S. freezing order arrived in Shanghai on July 26, the market was initially chaotic because the truth about the freezing was unclear. After American banks received General Notes No. 58 and No. 59 on the 29th, the freezing measures were not as strict as generally expected. The so-called freezing was just a kind of restriction. As a result, the foreign exchange market not only did not disappear because of this, but instead triggered a huge storm. The reasons were: (1) 14 foreign banks in Shanghai had notes to continue buying and selling foreign exchange, and the foreign exchange market did not disappear, and the market was as prosperous as before. (2) Chinese and Japanese merchants could freely buy and sell foreign exchange without being frozen. The forward bills of exchange that had been sold before were now replenished in full. (3) Due to the restrictions of the notes, all foreign exchange positions of Chinese banks could not be freely sold on the market. (4) There were no detailed regulations on the application for foreign exchange, and foreign banks took advantage of their superior power to seek profits. On the one hand, they implemented squeeze measures, and on the other hand, they quoted prices at exorbitant prices, which caused the exchange rate to fall again and again. The U.S. dollar saw a low price of $4.50 again. Therefore, the result of this freezing of funds was that legal tender was under great pressure, foreign exchange business of Chinese merchants was suspended, and foreign banks had the opportunity to monopolize and obtained many unexpected gains. Although this kind of situation is an inevitable phenomenon in the transition period, we cannot but regret that the freezing is not thorough and has many loopholes.

### Recent Trends of the Exchange Equalization Fund A Tentative Survey of the Exchange Equalization Law Wang Liewang

As a result of the Exchange Equalization Fund's meeting in Hong Kong, trial measures for September were announced on the 9th of this month. The measures are called trial measures and are preceded by the words "September," indicating that they are temporary in nature. If there are no major obstacles in the implementation, the trial period can be extended. Otherwise, the next month must be amended. This is also well known. In order to cope with the complicated situation and special environment of Shanghai, it is necessary to reserve flexibility in order to facilitate practice.

These trial measures are instructions to licensed banks for applying for foreign exchange. There are ten articles in total, with an attached list of permitted foreign exchange settlements, divided into two categories, A and B. Category A lists three essential goods in Shanghai: rice, petroleum products, and coal, with tobacco leaves included. According to the policy of state control over imports, tobacco leaves are one of the items prohibited from import as of July 1, 1928. The items listed in Category B are mostly among those prohibited from import. The percentage of foreign exchange settlement permitted for the Category A list is probably larger than that of Category B, as reported by banking sources. However, on the list, the status of tobacco leaves is only determined by rice, which seems inconsistent with the national import control policy, and most of the other listed imported goods violate the Ministry of Finance's ban on imports. The reason for this flexible measure is that most of the imported goods listed are raw materials for Shanghai industries, production tools, and consumer goods for foreigners. If foreign exchange is not settled for these commodities, Shanghai's industry and commerce will inevitably be severely affected, and there may be a panic. Therefore, in order to take into account the interests of foreign businessmen, and for the sake of employment of millions of employees and laborers in Shanghai, the adoption of this flexible measure is the same meaning as the previous establishment of the Exchange Equalization Fund to maintain illegal foreign exchange trading in Shanghai.

These measures are generally based on the principle of quota allocation. Judging from this principle, there are four questions about quota supply: 1. How to determine the total amount of foreign exchange supplied each month? 2. How to determine the objects of foreign exchange supply? 3. How to determine the foreign exchange allocation for various imported goods on the list? 4. How to determine the foreign exchange allocation for merchants allowed to settle foreign exchange? The following is a separate description and discussion of these four questions:

(1) The Total Amount of Foreign Exchange Supplied Each Month

Question

The total amount of the current Exchange Equalization Fund is 110 million US dollars (this number is the sum of 50 million supplied by American businessmen, 10 million pounds from the United Kingdom, equivalent to about 40 million US dollars, and 20

### European War Musings (7) - Soviet Russia's Vast Land and People

Russians dislike routine and prefer opportunities for extraordinary and surprising displays. Soviet newspapers often proclaim exceptionally high productivity for individual workers, but according to the consistent opinion of foreign engineers and technicians, the average daily productivity per worker in the Soviet Union is still below the standards of Western countries. Some years ago, Soviet Russia paid close attention to planting gooseberries and other foreign berries in the Arctic regions, while seemingly neglecting the possibility of developing more extensive orchards in other suitable areas.

The appearance of Russian life has been greatly influenced by the revolution in many ways. Social classes have become more equal, the urban population has greatly increased, and many new factories, workers' residences, office buildings, and the Moscow subway, etc., all indicate modernization.

The Soviet Union has a large-scale automobile manufacturing plant, modeled after the Ford factory, but its production capacity lags far behind. Because Soviet Russia has few and poor roads, the automobile industry is not very developed.

Soviet farmers account for two-thirds of the total population, and after the revolution, the psychology and life of the farmers have completely changed. The first achievement of the Communist Party after seizing power was to allow farmers to seize and divide all the landlords' property. Twelve years after the revolution, Soviet land was divided into small farms averaging nineteen to twenty acres, and the free buying and selling of land was prohibited long ago. The Soviet Union also actively carried out industrialization plans, attracting a large number of farmers into new industries, and the lives of workers have also undergone great changes.

Like farmers, there is a clear division among workers of different ages. Young workers are easily moved by Soviet slogans, while older workers pay more attention to practical life. The Soviet government's appeals have always focused on national defense, without mentioning the achievements of the revolution and collective farms. This may have a significant impact on the mood of the Soviet people!

In terms of the geography of western Soviet Russia, Leningrad has many shipyards that can build battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines, and other ships. Soviet naval guns are also manufactured at the Putilov Steel Works there. Kronstadt is the only important naval port on the Baltic coast. Sevastopol is the main naval port on the Black Sea coast, and there are many shipyards nearby.

If the German army could occupy the above ports, its naval strength would be greatly enhanced. The Soviet Union originally had 1.4 million tons of merchant ships, and perhaps a part of it would inevitably be seized. The situation of the Axis powers on the high seas will also change at that time. Direct navigation between the threatened Baltic Sea and Black Sea will be possible, and they can free up considerable naval force to escort goods from the Black Sea to the coastal ports of Europe in the Mediterranean, to alleviate the European economic panic.

Soviet Russia's inland canals are interconnected and extremely important for transportation. If a single one of the many river ships and steamships falls into the hands of the German army, they will definitely make good use of them.

From a purely economic point of view, Ukraine, the Caucasus, and Belarus are the most fertile regions. In the past, the Soviet Union exported grains, most of which came from Ukraine. The region is rich in sugar cane, wheat, and coal and iron. Almost all of the Soviet Union's only manganese mines are in Ukraine.

In recent years, although the Soviet authorities have established many factories in the Ural Mountains around Sverdlovsk and Chelyabinsk, and in Central Asia, most of the machine manufacturing plants and steel mills are still located in Ukraine, especially around Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, and Dnipro.

Belarus is rich in livestock, grains, and sweet potatoes. The Caucasus not only produces coal and oil, but is also known for its copper, leather, and forests. These western regions of the Soviet Union also produce large quantities of livestock, many flax fields, and thousands of acres of vegetable fields. Germany, which lacks fat, must be drooling.

If the Caucasus falls, even if the Red Army carries out extensive destruction before retreating, it will not be able to stop the region from producing oil for more than a year. On the surface, it seems that if the German army can force the Red Army to retreat to the interior, it can seize a large amount of materials and equipment, at which time Germany's military needs will be able to obtain endless new resources, and new transportation routes can be opened up, breaking the British naval blockade.

But the problem is not that simple. During the last European War, the German army also controlled the entire area of Ukraine and almost Rostov, but it was of no avail. Russia has always had transportation difficulties, which even German organizational experts cannot solve. This situation is bound to reappear today. The Soviet people are rich in latent destructive power. But the fundamental difficulty does not lie here.

First, if Germany transports Soviet food and riches to Europe to prevent famine in Europe, then famine is likely to occur in any of the occupied areas of the Soviet Union, thereby causing resentment among the people of the occupied areas. For example, last April, the Soviet Union promised to transport 250,000 tons of grain to relieve Belgium, but only one-ninth was shipped out, and the food shortage in western Soviet Russia had already become acute. Moreover, Ukraine's harvest this year will inevitably be greatly affected by the war.

Most of the Soviet Union's agricultural production relies on tractors, and because of agricultural mechanization, gasoline has become a necessity for agricultural work. Last year, the Soviet Union produced a total of 52 million tons of oil, of which only 1 million tons were exported. The oil production in 1927 was less than last year, but 6 million tons were exported. This is more due to the sharp increase in agricultural use than to stockpiling oil for war. This year, if thousands of machinery stations cannot distribute gasoline on time, cultivation will inevitably be greatly affected, then Soviet Russia itself will inevitably suffer from famine, let alone relieve Europe.

The German authorities are well aware that the benefits of occupying western Soviet Russia can hardly be realized within this year, and obviously hope to consolidate their position as soon as possible to prepare for a long-term war.

### Transferring De-Sealed Funds to the Central Bank; Payment in Original Foreign Currency Permitted

Limited to Purchasing and Transporting Non-Prohibited Items; Other Legitimate Uses Also Subject to Application

Shanghai Importers and Exporters Should Sincerely Cooperate with the Stabilization Board

After the Central Bank was ordered to handle the de-sealing of foreign exchange assets of Chinese citizens, all foreign exchange drafts held by exporters of various industries and foreign exchange deposit certificates deposited by Chinese citizens in Chinese commercial banks operating foreign exchange may be applied to the Central Bank for de-sealing, or the Central Bank may purchase them at a price set by the Ministry (i.e., the exchange rate set by the Stabilization Fund), or transfer them to the bank to open new foreign currency accounts. If foreign exchange is needed for legitimate purposes, an application should be filed in advance, and the original currency may be withdrawn only after approval.

Foreign Banks' Deposit Disposal

Regarding foreign currency deposits deposited by Chinese citizens in foreign banks, they have also been frozen and cannot be freely withdrawn. However, Chinese citizens can also transfer the bank's deposit certificates to the Central Bank for de-sealing. Foreign friendly banks are allowed to pay in legal tender converted according to the market price. Private transfers or sales to importers are absolutely prohibited in order to prevent malpractices and comply with the freezing decree. As for the legal tender deposits of Chinese citizens in foreign banks, they can still be freely deposited or withdrawn and are not subject to any restrictions. The 14 friendly banks, including HSBC, Citibank, and Mercantile Bank, that have obtained general notes from the United States have mostly implemented the above methods to prevent the outflow of foreign exchange deposits.

Payment in Original Currency Subject to Approval

The New Life News Agency reporter recently learned from the Central Bank that all foreign exchange funds of Chinese citizens that have been de-sealed and transferred to the bank may apply for payment in the original foreign currency in accordance with the following regulations: (1) The goods imported by depositors from foreign countries are not prohibited and are necessary for the country; (2) The necessary living expenses, tuition fees, and travel expenses for depositors or their family members residing in the country where the funds are frozen; (3) Other necessary and legitimate uses. All applicants for payment in the original foreign currency should state the reasons in detail and submit relevant documents to the Central Bank for forwarding to the Foreign Exchange Control Committee for approval. Payment is permitted only after approval.

Importers and Exporters Should Cooperate

Foreign economic expert Alles published an article in the Greater Shanghai Weekly yesterday, hoping that businessmen can sincerely cooperate with the Stabilization Board. It is said that the Stabilization Board manages the foreign exchange market by means of apportionment and purchasing export bills. Food rice imported by the Public Works Department can obtain 100% of the supply. On the other hand, the amount of foreign exchange obtained for many specially approved imported goods will be insufficient for the original needs in the future. There are also many goods that will not be obtained at all. Then the import quantity will be greatly reduced. However, the plan of the Stabilization Board has been decided and must be implemented. The Stabilization Board certainly cannot provide as much foreign exchange as Shanghai needs, fearing that it will repeat the mistakes of the Sino-British Stabilization Fund from 1939 to 1940. Shanghai businessmen have two opportunities to hope that the Stabilization Board will make greater contributions to Shanghai in the future. One is to cooperate sincerely with the Stabilization Board. Merchants who are fortunate enough to obtain foreign exchange should ensure that their foreign exchange does not flow out. At the same time, the imported goods supplied with foreign exchange by the Stabilization Board should not be sold directly or indirectly to others. Another opportunity is to make the foreign exchange earned from exports in the future more than the Stabilization Board expects. The Stabilization Board has no intention of hoarding foreign exchange at the expense of Shanghai. The more foreign exchange Shanghai sells to the Stabilization Board, the more foreign exchange the Board will allow Shanghai to have. If Shanghai's exports to democratic countries can maintain the level at the end of July this year, the amount of foreign exchange settlement for specially approved imported goods will inevitably increase greatly. Conversely, if Shanghai's exports are sluggish and produce less export foreign exchange, the amount of foreign exchange settlement will inevitably decrease. Shanghai businessmen must make the greatest efforts to realize these two opportunities. If so, they will surely be rewarded.

### Japanese and Police Arrest People on Hankou Road

Three People Arrested at the Huibinlou Restaurant, Taken Back to Their Residence for Search and Taken to the Police Station

At about 6:30 pm yesterday, several Japanese people, accompanied by police officers from the Central Police Station, suddenly rushed to Room 7, Taipingfang, 341 Hankou Road, upstairs in the right wing room, in two cars and searched the room. They left after about two hours. It is said that Yan Junsu, a native of Dongting Mountain, Suzhou, 27 or 28 years old, was having dinner with two friends at the Huibinlou Restaurant on Simalu at about 6 pm yesterday, when several Japanese people, accompanied by Chinese and Western police officers, suddenly arrived and arrested all three of them. They were immediately taken to their residence at 7 Taipingfang for search. After the reporter went to investigate, he saw that the clothes boxes, etc. in the room were in a mess. According to his roommates, Yan was gentle and weak, like a scholar. This sudden arrest is really puzzling.

### US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Willkie, Passes Through Shanghai on His Way Home

US Ambassador to Moscow, Willkie, recently returned home on business. He has departed from Moscow and is traveling by train through Siberia to China. Willkie has arrived in Shanghai and is waiting for a ship to return to Washington via San Francisco. Willkie's trip is secret, and few outsiders know about it. The President Harrison left Shanghai yesterday afternoon and has left Shanghai on board.

### Advisory Committee's Allocation of Members to be Established Next Week

The Public Works Department has decided to levy a special property tax on business premises from January 1 next year. However, before the opening of the levy, in accordance with the resolution of the special meeting of foreign taxpayers on April 17 this year, the opinions of the Advisory Committee must be sought. However, how this organization will be formed is directly related to administration. How many people will there be, how will the candidates be selected, and the Public Works Department and the consuls of the countries concerned are negotiating. According to the Dazhong News Agency reporter, the principle has been decided on the allocation of members, with 3 each for Britain, the United States, and Japan, 4 for the Chinese side, and 1 each for Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, for a total of 16 people. It is not yet known what method will be used to produce representatives, but it is expected that it will be established within the next week.
