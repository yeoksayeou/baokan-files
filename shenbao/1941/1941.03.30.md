### Uncontrollable Balkans: Nations Trapped in Dilemma; Romania Follows Suit, Demanding Revision of Territorial Cession Decision; Greece and Turkey May Establish Military Alliance

New York - Yugoslavia's anti-Axis coup d'état has caused Germany serious and complex consequences. Hitler is in a dilemma, having to decide whether to use force to restore the old government of Yugoslavia or wait for future developments to avoid future dangers. If Hitler adheres to the policy of conquering small countries by diplomacy rather than force, he will probably not take hasty action. The German side believes that the alliance agreement has been signed by Yugoslavia and that there is no need to interfere in its internal affairs. However, if the Yugoslav government officially does not recognize the alliance treaty, Hitler will hesitate to launch a military strike. The Yugoslav parliament has not yet ratified the agreement, which is a legitimate procedure for delaying the treaty. If Hitler uses force to suppress Yugoslavia, the resistance of the Yugoslav army will inevitably be aided by British troops stationed in Greece, easily igniting a major fire in the entire Balkans. The revolution is highly contagious, and Germany's control in the Balkans will become increasingly difficult. Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu is engaging in major negotiations with Hungary regarding the treatment of Romanians in Transylvania, and there are frequent reports of Bulgarian sabotage of industry. Turkey's attitude is particularly influenced by the situation in Yugoslavia. According to news from the past 48 hours, Moscow originally intended to reconsider its friendship with Germany if Yugoslavia were to be drawn in by Germany. Therefore, the impact on Germany is very complex. If force is not used, it will inevitably affect Germany's prestige in the Balkans. Even more unfortunately, this matter has made a very poor impression on Matsuoka Yosuke, who is currently visiting Berlin. Germany originally tried to demonstrate how it controls Europe, but what Matsuoka saw was Germany's weakness. It is difficult to predict what course of action Hitler will take in the future, as even he himself cannot decide. (United Press, 29th)

Budapest - Newspapers here recently published the following declaration by Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu: "I recently had to request the authorities in Berlin and Rome to revise the Vienna Award, otherwise there will be incidents in Romania. I believe that unless the issue of Transylvania is resolved, there will be no peace in this part of Europe." (Note: According to the Vienna Award, Germany ordered Romania to cede Transylvania to Hungary). Local official reports commented, "The strange declaration of the Romanian leader" and stated that the declaration will shock the world. (TASS, 29th)

Vichy - Romania will change its existing system of government. According to news from Bucharest received by the Vichy News Agency, the current military regime in Romania will soon be replaced by a civilian government. Although General Antonescu will remain Prime Minister, representatives of the Liberal Party and the National People's Party will join the government. (Reuters, 29th)

Budapest - Yesterday, a source from an Axis country here stated that it is rumored in Istanbul that a mutual assistance pact between Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece may be signed soon. (United Press, 29th)

Istanbul - Diplomatic circles here predicted yesterday that a treaty of mutual assistance and military alliance between Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece will soon be announced. It is said that Yugoslav troops are currently concentrated on the Monastir to 　 Ding Qilian front in southern Serbia. (International Telegram, 29th)

### Yugoslav Army Moves Million to Border Daily; Turkey Conducts Paratrooper Defense Exercises

Belgrade - Reliable sources here declared yesterday that Yugoslavia yesterday dispatched 1.25 million troops to the four defense zones on the German border at full speed and notified Hitler in advance that "certain points" in the Axis treaty were unacceptable to the public. It is now heard that the new Prime Minister General Simović and the entire nation are awaiting a German response in writing or in action. (United Press, 29th)

Ankara - A defense parachute unit exercise was held in Izmir Port on the Aegean coast of Turkey. The scale of the exercise was the largest in the Turkish air force. The public also participated in the exercise, some carrying rifles and other weapons. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

Istanbul - Diplomatic sources reported from Bulgaria today that German troops are fully prepared to launch a sudden attack on Greece, but have not yet done so for political reasons. It is reported that German troops have concentrated 150,000 troops in the Pirin region in the southwestern corner of Bulgaria and are preparing to advance westward into the Vardar River valley or southward into the Robel Pass toward Greece. Diplomatic sources said that vehicles departing from Plovdiv have transported German troops to various locations along the eastern border of Thrace. Most of the Bulgarian troops are concentrated on the Turkish border, and the actions and troop deployments of the 　 army now indicate that their first move is against Greece. (United Press, 29th)

### Yugoslav Queen Mother Prepares to Return Home; Hears of Son Reclaiming Power; Chronic Illness Suddenly Cured

London - Queen Marie of Yugoslavia, who was ill in a 16th-century village house in Huntingtonshire, was overjoyed when she received the news that her son Peter II had reclaimed power. Her chronic illness has suddenly been cured, and she will return home with her two young sons who are currently studying in Surrey. She told people, "I have deep faith in my son's future, and I naturally want to be by his side at this time." (Reuters, 28th)

### Estimated Strength of Yugoslavia: Land, Sea, and Air Forces Capable of Fighting

London - Military observers declared today that the Yugoslav army is estimated to have about 1.25 million people. They need anti-tank guns, mechanized units, and mortars. The Yugoslav combat units are well-equipped with rifles and automatic weapons. There are two cavalry divisions, some of which are mechanized, but they still need tanks, armored vehicles, and anti-tank weapons. Experts also stated that the Yugoslav air force has 48 squadrons with 900 aircraft, of which 450 are first-line fighters, including German Messerschmitt 109s, British Hurricanes, Fierce Fighters, British Blenheims, and German Dornier bombers. The Yugoslav navy was established not long ago and has 8 destroyers, 10 old torpedo boats, 10 motor torpedo boats, 4 submarines, several smaller warships, and 190 merchant ships. (United Press, 29th)

London - A Reuters naval reporter stated that although the Yugoslav navy is small, it is quite strong. If Yugoslavia decides to fight the Axis powers, the Yugoslav navy will greatly trouble the remaining Italian navy. The Yugoslav navy has a total of 6,300 officers and men and 1,120 reservists. Some officers, especially those belonging to submarines, have received training in the British navy. The Yugoslav fleet has 4 good destroyers, with the fifth about to be completed, 4 submarines, several torpedo boats, 6 mine-laying ships and mine-sweeping ships each, several other small boats, and 1 old-fashioned light cruiser. The Yugoslav coast has 3 good naval bases, namely 　 Pula, Kotor, and Šibenik, with Šibenik being the most difficult to attack. The secrets in the straits between the small island bases and various ports are only known to the Yugoslavs. (Reuters, 29th)

### Germany Decides to Send Memorandum to Yugoslavia, Setting Deadline to Clarify Attitude

London - The British "Exchange Telegraph" recently carried a telegram from Zurich stating that Germany has decided to give Yugoslavia a deadline of three days to decide its attitude towards the Tripartite Pact. Hitler, Goering, Ribbentrop, and Keitel held a special meeting yesterday, and as a result, this final memorandum was decided. (United Press, 29th)

Bucharest, Romania - "The World News" published a message stating that the German Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Heeren, inquired of the new Yugoslav Foreign Minister Ninčić yesterday. The response given by Yugoslavia did not seem to satisfy the German side, as the Axis powers cannot regard ambiguous expressions as satisfactory. (Havas, 29th)

Capital of Yugoslavia - According to well-informed sources here, the German Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Heeren, has been recalled to his country. (Reuters, 29th)

Berlin - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said yesterday that Germany had not negotiated with the new Yugoslav government's policies, but had received information about anti-German actions in Yugoslavia, so it would protest to the Yugoslav government. One of the clauses in the Tripartite Pact stipulates that the pact is effective in the signatory countries, so it should be implemented without ratification. At the same time, the official German news agency received news from the capital of Bulgaria that traffic between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia has been cut off. Since the coup d'état on Thursday, railways 　 telegraphs and telephones have been completely out of service. The German Foreign Ministry did not express any opinion on the conflicting news coming from Yugoslavia and the difficulties caused by the situation in the Yugoslav capital. German officials only stated that traffic was obstructed, so the situation in Yugoslavia was difficult to determine, and the news was contradictory, making it even more difficult to judge. Political circles in Berlin did not express anything, only stating that the declaration issued by the new Yugoslav government did not reveal its attitude towards the Tripartite Pact. The official German news agency also received news from the capital of Southern Germany stating that the Yugoslav government seemed not to have decided on the policy direction it should adopt. However, there have been important changes in the Yugoslav news agency, with a pro-British figure appointed as president and many editors replaced. According to Nazi opinion, the Axis Pact does not require ratification, so Yugoslavia's accession to this long-standing alliance does not pose a problem. (Reuters, 29th)

### Anti-Axis Sentiment High in Yugoslavia; German Nationals Ordered to Evacuate from Yugoslavia

Belgrade - This afternoon, authoritative German sources stated that not only German nationals in Belgrade City must evacuate, but also German nationals throughout Serbia. However, German nationals residing in Croatia and Slovakia can remain as usual. Only three reporters from Germany remain in Serbia, and the rest have evacuated. One of the three remaining is a reporter from the Haitong News Agency. In total, approximately 300 to 400 German nationals will be evacuated. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

Berlin - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry declared this afternoon that our country is closely monitoring the developments in the capital of Yugoslavia and the growth of anti-German forces among Yugoslav political leaders. The German government has not yet issued a statement on the situation in Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia has an anti-German tendency due to the high tide of Serbian radicals. The German Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Heeren, encountered insults from the crowd on his way to attend the coronation ceremony of Peter II, which was incited by these radicals. It has been confirmed that Heeren met with Yugoslav Prime Minister Simović and Foreign Minister yesterday. In terms of the general situation in Yugoslavia, it does not seem to have changed its basic diplomatic policy, but the situation has not yet been clarified, so there are still conflicting reports about Yugoslavia's intentions continuing to be transmitted here. When Yugoslavia joined the Tripartite Pact, Germany expressed the hope of stabilizing the situation in Southeast Europe, so any 　 forces in Yugoslavia that resist this objective should bear the consequences. (Haitong News Agency)

### Yugoslav Communists Hold Demonstrations; Coup Apparently Supported by Soviet Union

Capital of Yugoslavia - 30,000 demonstrators from the Yugoslav Communist Party disregarded the ban on gatherings in the streets yesterday and poured into the city center 　, making rebellious pro-Soviet expressions. All available soldiers, tanks, and machine guns in the capital were deployed to key locations to prevent the demonstrations from becoming uncontrollable. However, the demonstrators were clearly carefully organized and maintained good order. A steamboat on the Danube River will carry all Germans leaving the capital of Yugoslavia on Monday. Knowledgeable people say that Germany is preparing to apply unlimited "maximum pressure" to obtain the cooperation of the new Yugoslav regime with the Axis powers. Last night, the Yugoslav United Front seemed to be gradually splitting, which has a serious impact on the future of Yugoslavia. Croats have begun to express opposition to the military in the new regime. Serbians, who are determined to fight Germany, may refuse to support the government's maintenance of neutrality. As for the new government, although it is under pressure from the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Greece, it is determined to respect the treaties signed by the previous regime, including the pact to join the Axis powers, but any secret conditions must be abolished. It is said that a "principled" guarantee has been given to the Axis powers. (International News Agency, 29th)

New York - American newspapers believe that the coup d'état in Yugoslavia is a loss of prestige for Hitler, but opinions are quite divided on whether he will use force or political means to restore Germany's favorable position in the Balkans. American radio critics were deeply impressed by the Soviet Union's apparent support for the coup d'état by the new Yugoslav leader General Simović. (Reuters, 29th)

Capital of Yugoslavia - Yugoslavia had a coup d'état on the night of the 26th of this month. All important officials of the former government were arrested and detained in the headquarters of the General Staff. They have now been released by the government, but former Prime Minister Cvetković and the head of the Belgrade Police Department, Inchkić, have not yet been released. (Havas, 28th)

Editorial

### Prospects for the Balkan Situation

Just a week ago, the Yugoslav authorities were deeply embracing the Nazis, and Germany was happily preparing to complete the final procedures for accepting this new partner. The Balkan Peninsula, except for Greece, could be said to be largely settled. At that time, this newspaper commented on the matter, expressing its sighs and regrets, but in that moment of despair, it put forward two reservations: Firstly, if Germany wanted to ensure Yugoslavia's peaceful submission as its ally, Hitler must not make further demands; and secondly, there must be no major changes in the Yugoslav regime. Who knew that in the last three days, a major change would actually occur.

This is not to show off to readers that the previous argument was subtly correct. It is certainly not to grasp the inevitability of the realization of the major change. It is only that we have an unshakable belief in our hearts, from which inspiration arises. This belief and inspiration are not unique to us; but because recent world events seem to be everywhere showing madness to the point of having no reason or normality to speak of, the most ordinary beliefs have been obscured, and the usual inspirations have fallen into a state of numbness. What is this belief? It is the consciousness of national self-respect and self-love, as well as the demand for independence and freedom, which are innate and endowed to every enlightened nation; they are hidden in ordinary times, and when it comes to the autumn of danger and survival, the power after their mobilization is unstoppable, and the result after their mobilization is just and successful. The aggressors fundamentally deny that this belief can be established, and Hitler's gains have almost proven the emptiness of this belief; countries like China and Greece, on the contrary, are regarded as almost exceptions. We intellectually believe that this belief will never be erased, even though we have unfortunately witnessed various counter-evidences under Hitler's authority, the belief is still a belief; and the vigorous public opinion and popular indignation in Yugoslavia before the realization of this major change made us, in the moment before witnessing the near collapse of the tide, instinctively and intuitively feel the inspiration that could promote the major change. Now, the major change has actually been realized!

This time, Yugoslavia signed the Axis Pact on the 25th of this month, and Hitler was proudly welcoming his guest Matsuoka, flaunting his diplomatic victory; but he did not expect that Peter II, who was seventeen and a half years old, would reclaim power at one o'clock in the morning on the 27th, implement a new government, and quietly send twenty soldiers to arrest the cabinet members responsible for signing the alliance, completing the so-called "bloodless coup." Then, on the one hand, he issued an edict to appease the people, and on the other hand, he appointed the army leader General Simović to form a new cabinet, and the whole country responded. Thus, in just a few hours, a "vassal of the Axis" who was like a prisoner awaiting trial jumped to become an independent, self-reliant, and promising nation. People who have observed the enthusiastic situation of the Yugoslav people celebrating freedom in the past two days truly feel, as British Prime Minister Churchill said, that this country has found its precious "national soul" again at the last moment. Is this not ironic, that the Axis officials in Berlin, who were elated, and the allied guests who had just unpacked and were receiving courteous treatment, felt that the lamb that was originally at their lips had now turned into an uncontrollable fierce tiger and lion; that they could originally exaggerate victory, but now they had to admit defeat. The Axis front has suffered such a serious blow in diplomacy, the significance and impact of which can be equated with the military setbacks of Italy in Abyssinia and Eritrea, or even surpass them.

Although the success of this major change was surprisingly rapid and seemed abrupt, it was actually very natural to observe its process. As early as when the Cvetković cabinet disregarded the opposition of public opinion and ignored the advice of the United States, Britain, and even the Soviet Union, and insisted on joining the alliance, three cabinet members left in anger, and some city residents protested, all of which were clear signs. According to news from Moscow newspapers, the Yugoslav ruling authorities shot at the crowds who returned home after signing the treaty, and it was expected that this would lead to civil unrest; moreover, British diplomacy, under the personal guidance of Foreign Secretary Eden, never neglected Yugoslavia for a moment; as for the Soviet Union, having already been dissatisfied with Bulgaria's permission for German troops to pass through, it certainly did not want another Slavic country (the Serbian ethnic group belongs to the Slavic race) to follow suit and succumb to Germany; under the circumstances of internal public opinion and external encouragement from friendly countries, the young Yugoslav monarch and the generally sober-minded, freedom-loving military men and politicians emerged, broke free from their shackles, and could this be regarded as unexpected?

It is widely rumored that the new Yugoslav government has declared "independence." Whether it will directly abolish the alliance that was signed less than five days ago is not known at this time, but if Germany still wants to invoke this treaty to infringe upon Yugoslavia's sovereignty and integrity, then in today's situation where the anti-German movement has spread throughout the country and the United States and British governments have successively declared their willingness to provide assistance, it is feared that it will inevitably lead to armed resistance. It is heard that the German government has submitted "urgent documents" to Belgrade, demanding clarification on two points: What is Yugoslavia's attitude towards the Axis powers? What is Yugoslavia's position on the Tripartite Pact? But it is generally speculated that the answers to these two questions will be difficult to satisfy the Axis powers. Regarding the first question, Yugoslavia will certainly declare its willingness to be on friendly terms with all countries, but it must be that others do not offend me, and I do not offend others, otherwise it will not hesitate to fight; regarding the second question, it can only ask Germany to pay attention to the facts that have occurred in Yugoslavia in recent days. Since the old government fell because of the alliance, even if the new government is still prepared to sign some kind of agreement with the Axis powers, it will at least need to change its form and content.

On the other hand, after Yugoslavia's awakening, the entire Balkans has been greatly shaken. Some say that Turkey and Yugoslavia will soon establish a mutual assistance pact, and others say that Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Greece are preparing to consider military cooperation; some even say that the Romanian dictator has issued a statement demanding the revision of the Vienna Agreement on the cession of Transylvania to avoid causing domestic unrest. Therefore, looking ahead, not only may the Balkan Entente be revived, but some Balkan countries that have already yielded may also be affected in the future.

No wonder South African General Smuts said, "Germany has been defeated in the Balkan war by a young child, Peter." This is a very strange 　!

### New Yugoslav Monarch Takes Office; Britain and the United States Send Congratulations

Capital of Yugoslavia - The new monarch Peter II was sworn in yesterday. The content of his oath is as follows: "At the beginning of my reign, I solemnly swear before God that I will devote myself to the unity of the nation, the independence of the country, and the integrity of the territory, govern the country in accordance with the Constitution, and always have the welfare of the people in mind. May God help me, Amen." (Havas, 29th)

London - King George VI of England, on the occasion of the accession of the new Yugoslav monarch, sent a telegram to Peter II 　 expressing his congratulations. (Havas, 28th)

Washington - President Roosevelt recently sent a telegram congratulating King Peter II of Yugoslavia, saying that the Yugoslav people are brave and independent people, and sincerely wished for the health of the Yugoslav King and the freedom and independence of Yugoslavia. The telegram also stated, "I hope that the relationship between the United States and Yugoslavia will benefit each other by supporting the principles of freedom and tolerance embraced by the peoples of both countries." (Reuters, 29th)

Capital of Yugoslavia - Yugoslav Peter II was sworn into office in front of the Prime Minister and civil and military officials yesterday, and then held a solemn prayer ceremony in the Great Cathedral. When the new King entered and exited the Great Cathedral, the people flocked to watch and celebrate, and the scene was rare. The new monarch smiled and raised his hand to thank the people. Thanksgiving ceremonies were also held in other churches. The previous coup was completed in one hour, and the pre-arrangements were meticulously planned, so the revolution was completed without bloodshed. Peter II personally took power at night 　 o'clock, and then ordered a military officer to lead twenty soldiers directly to Prime Minister 　 Cvetković's official residence, urging the Prime Minister to get up and informing him that he was ordered to arrest him. Other pro-German cabinet members were also treated in the same way and quietly arrested. At the same time, the new Prime Minister Simović summoned former cabinet members who had resigned in opposition to German compromise day and night. At 7:00 in the morning, all radio stations in the capital of Southern China broadcast the King's proclamation. In less than an hour, crowds had gathered outside the embassies of various European countries, expressing their support for democratic countries. Outside the British embassy, crowds held up national flags and sang patriotic songs. The Greek ambassador was even raised over the shoulders by the crowd to show the Yugoslav people's support for the Greek soldiers and civilians 　, while military police were stationed outside the German and Italian embassies to protect them, in case of disturbances. At the same time, people marched through the streets carrying flags, shouting long live the King and the Army, and demanding an alliance with the Soviet Union. In the morning, German tourists suffered minor damage, and in the afternoon, smoke was still coming out of the社址 (unsure on translation of this term, possibly a typo). All the Croats who took office had agreed to cooperate with the new government, but the effectiveness of their cooperation depended on the plan to stop the activities of the Franco faction. The Franco faction is a faction among the Croatian ethnic group that advocates separation. This faction has provided assistance to German Croatian propaganda and often supported the regime that collapsed on Thursday. (Reuters, 29th)

### Yugoslavia Follows a Policy of Independence; Armed Neutrality is Held as a Creed

Belgrade, Yugoslavia - Yugoslavia announced yesterday its "independence" and notified Germany, saying that the situation in Yugoslavia could be clearly demonstrated by the facts themselves. Yugoslav troops, under a full mobilization order, marched grandly to the border to resist threats from any side. Well-informed sources said that the German Embassy here had been notified that the situation in Yugoslavia could speak for itself, and that "certain points (i.e., the Tripartite Pact) can only be accepted by the people with the greatest difficulty." The first declaration stated that the Yugoslav government hoped that its neighbors would not encounter difficulties, but that Yugoslavia would henceforth follow a policy of independence. This declaration was issued after a midnight cabinet meeting and a enthusiastic parade yesterday afternoon, when King Peter II and his cabinet members went to church for a thanksgiving service. The people of the capital were given another opportunity during the special thanksgiving service, flocking to the city center, shouting hoarsely. The crowds repeatedly broke through police cordons, surrounded the cars of British and American diplomats, and cheered for Britain, the United States, and Roosevelt. When the cars of Axis nationals passed by, the citizens merely watched in silence. Cars from Poland, Turkey, Greece, and the Soviet Union were also welcomed by the crowds. (United Press dispatch, 29th)

Belgrade, Yugoslavia - How will Yugoslavia's foreign policy move after the coup? This is a matter of global concern. Well-informed sources here recently commented, "Neutrality" is still Yugoslavia's creed. Although Yugoslavia does not oppose the alliance treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan, it is now attempting to improve relations with Turkey based on the Turkish government's previous proposal of mutual cooperation in important areas of both countries. It can be asserted that General Simović's cabinet has telegraphed the ambassador to the Soviet Union, Gavrilović, to return home as soon as possible to be appointed as a minister without portfolio. It is reported that Gavrilović took the road through Hungary last night to return home and will take office as soon as he arrives. According to news from Zagreb, it has not yet been decided whether Maček, the leader of the Croat people, will join the new cabinet. The administrative head of the Cetingrad district, Žeba, has been dispatched to participate in today's cabinet meeting as a stand-in. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### Maček's Entry into the Cabinet Undecided; Announcement of Political Views Still Pending

Belgrade - It was generally expected that the new Yugoslav government would announce its platform this morning, but this did not materialize. It is said that political views cannot be revealed before Dr. Maček, leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, indicates whether or not he will join the cabinet. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 29th)

### Yugoslavia Will Not Abandon the Pact; Secret Clauses Not Binding

London - A special correspondent for the Exchange Telegraph Company stationed in the Swiss capital declared today that officials in the Yugoslav capital said that Yugoslavia would not abandon the published Tripartite Pact. According to officials in Nanjing, the new Yugoslav government has inherited all the obligations of the previous government, so the declaration of Germany and Italy guaranteeing Yugoslavia's sovereignty and integrity should still be considered valid. However, if there are any secret clauses attached to the pact (which seems quite possible), the new government is not bound by them because it does not know their content. (United Press dispatch, 29th)

### Yugoslavia Declares Martial Law; Prevents Outsiders from Causing Disturbances

Vichy - Vichy News Agency - A dispatch from the capital says that Yugoslavia has declared martial law and issued a notice to the people of the country. When the Yugoslav capital radio station broadcast this news, it urged the people to obey orders to prevent any "foreign elements" from taking the opportunity to cause disturbances. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

### Order in the Capital Gradually Restored; Former Premier Not Yet Released

Belgrade, Yugoslavia - Since last night, order has been completely restored here. Residents are following the advice of the Prime Minister to remain calm and avoid friction with neighboring countries. The troops stationed in various agencies and key areas in the capital have been withdrawn, but there are still a few tanks patrolling the streets. Traffic has returned to normal and shops have reopened. This afternoon, thousands of farmers were seen wandering through the thoroughfares, a different sight from the past, as these people came to the capital from the suburbs to celebrate the young king's accession to the throne. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### British Forces Advance Towards Addis Ababa; 130,000 Italian Troops Surrounded; Indian Troops Establish Great Merit in the Battle of Keren; It is Expected that the East African War Will Soon End

Cairo - British forces advanced yesterday towards the Addis Ababa (i.e., the capital of Abyssinia) Djibouti railway and Asmara. It is reported that 130,000 troops have been surrounded. It is said that the troops in Harar have retreated in a panic to Dire Dawa (37 miles north of the railway), and it is also planned to evacuate the citizens of Addis Ababa. (United Press dispatch, 29th)

Cairo - British military personnel here, who are not prone to making rash statements, recently said that it is not overly optimistic to say that the East African war is expected to end soon. The Battle of Keren was quite large in scale, and that place is a rare and excellent natural fortress in the world. Considering this, the casualties of the British army in the Battle of Keren can be said to be relatively light. Many Indian troops who won this battle, including several famous British infantry divisions, made the greatest contribution. The Palestinian army, the Free French army, the Cape Town motor transport vehicles, and some French Foreign Legion units also contributed. A British military spokesman said that one of the most important impacts of the Battle of Keren was to give the patriotic Abyssinian army a stimulant. These Abyssinian troops will be delighted to hear the news. Thousands of Italian troops were captured in Keren, and the Italian army abandoned a lot of equipment in a panic. The British army took advantage of the victory to advance, and the next target is Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. It is generally believed that the Italian army will not make such a stubborn resistance in Asmara, and there are many Japanese Italians who have taken refuge in Asmara. It is generally believed that Abyssinian Governor-General Aosta must now consider how to deal with the non-combatants in Abyssinia. Regarding the British army's occupation of Harar in Abyssinia, it is expected that Dire Dawa, 25 miles from that place, will also be captured soon. The railway from Dire Dawa to Addis Ababa has been severely bombed by the British Air Force and is no longer of much use. According to the communiqué, when British aircraft recently attacked the railway, a troop train five miles east of Addis Ababa was strafed and damaged. The British Air Force also bombed enemy camps north of Lake Rudolf with great success. When the British army besieged Keren, the British Air Force, the South African Air Force, and the Rhodesian Air Force jointly assisted in the battle, constantly bombarding the position, ignoring enemy anti-aircraft fire, flying as low as fifty yards to drop drinking water, milk, food, and cigarettes to supply the vanguard British army, which made great contributions. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

### Fierce Naval Battle in the Eastern Mediterranean; One Italian Warship Heavily Damaged; Greek Submarine Sinks Italian Transport Ship

London - The Admiralty issued a communiqué this afternoon stating that in a naval battle in the Eastern Mediterranean, one Italian Littorio-class battleship was destroyed and two Italian cruisers were heavily damaged. As of midnight (Shanghai time), the battle was still in progress. Currently, the initial news received only reveals part of the situation. The original text of the Admiralty communiqué is as follows: Yesterday, the warships commanded by Admiral Cunningham, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, encountered the Italian fleet, including battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. The enemy ships scattered upon seeing our fleet, but several ships were forced to fight. As a result, at least one Littorio-class battleship was destroyed and two cruisers were heavily damaged. Aircraft from the British Naval Air Arm and the Royal Air Force were also sent out to bomb, but the results are not yet known. Greek warships also participated in this battle. A follow-up report will be announced upon receipt. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

London - The Greek submarine Triton has sunk an Italian transport ship of 5,000 tons fully loaded. According to the latest news from Albania, the war continues to be quiet, with only some scouting and artillery fire. Greek aircraft are constantly bombing enemy positions. The United States has so far donated $2 million to aid Greek refugees. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

### South African Plane Crash; Two Military Officials Killed

Cape Town - Yesterday, a South African Airways plane crashed in the mountains of Elands Bay, 100 miles north of here, killing ten people, including three leaders of the South African Defense Force. One was Major General Halifax, Director of South African Coastal Defense, the second was Lieutenant Colonel Hyaara, Director of Technical Defense, and the third was Colonel Serieye, Director of Coastal Air Force and Artillery. The crashed plane was flying from Ventersdorp to Cape Town. (United Press dispatch, 29th)

### Moscow Holds Anti-Paratrooper Drill; 20,000 Farmers Participate in Combat

Moscow - Starting today, ten districts around Moscow will jointly hold a large-scale "anti-paratrooper" exercise. 20,000 farmers will participate, all of whom have received training on how to fight paratroopers. Paratroopers, cavalry, and buglers from the Soviet Air Defense Association are all participating, and the public attaches great importance to this. (TASS dispatch, 29th)

### Asahi Shimbun Implies Japanese Warships Will Assist German Raiding Operations in the Pacific; Tokyo Apparently Acknowledges Matsuoka's German Visit Aims to Counteract the Effect of the US Lend-Lease Act in Aiding Britain

Tokyo - In an editorial, Asahi Shimbun implied the true purpose of Matsuoka's visit to Germany, saying, "How much hope does Germany place on the future work of the Japanese Navy?" Although the Japanese Foreign Minister has repeatedly stated that the trip to Berlin was only for mutual acquaintance, there is still much speculation here about the true purpose of his visit to Germany. Some speculate that when Germany launches its blitzkrieg strategy in the spring, Germany, Italy, and Japan may launch a three-pronged attack at the same time, while others say that Matsuoka may obtain Hitler's peace terms on this trip and entrust the United States to convey them to Britain. There are all kinds of rumors. However, both official and private circles clearly acknowledge that the Foreign Minister's trip aims to find ways to counteract the effect of the US Lend-Lease Act. Therefore, this responsible commentary by Asahi Shimbun can be regarded as a clue to the Axis's plan to counteract American aid to Britain. Since the United States can do its best to aid Britain, why should Japan not follow suit to support the Axis powers? The technical difficulties of transferring Japanese warships to Germany and Italy can be easily solved. German crew members can be transported to ports in North China via Siberia and board the warships that the Japanese Navy can allocate. There is no need to sail to German ports or enter the Atlantic Ocean, because there are many British ships in the Pacific Ocean that can be used as targets for German raids. It is not possible for outsiders to know what kind of warships and how many warships the Japanese Navy can allocate. However, Japan does not need to worry about any sea power's maritime attack. It is believed that a small part of the Japanese fleet is sufficient to cope with possible attacks on the Siberian coast of the Soviet Union. Although the Japanese Navy has important work in the war against China, most of the work it undertakes is auxiliary in nature, because the Japanese blockade of the Chinese coast lies in occupying various ports, not in blocking goods transported by sea into China. Although Europe and Asia are far apart, Japan cannot be a backer for Germany and Italy except by threatening the United States. However, the transfer of Japanese warships, even if only used in the East, is also a way to help Germany and Italy, and Japan will not be dragged into the war, because Japan's aid to Germany and Italy is just like the United States' aid to Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

### Matsuoka to Convene Diplomatic Envoys Conference in Berlin for Practical Discussions on the European Situation; Difficult to Expect Adjustment in Relations between Japan and the United States and Soviet Union

Tokyo, Asahi Shimbun reported yesterday that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, upon returning to Berlin from Rome on April 4th, will convene Japanese ambassadors stationed in Germany, Italy, and Turkey, as well as the Chargé d'affaires in France, to hold an "important conference" to discuss the practical European situation. It is said that Matsuoka is scheduled to leave Berlin for Rome by the end of the week. At the same time, careful political observers here believe that while Matsuoka outwardly insists that he does not intend to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, this is actually the purpose of his trip. According to Matsuoka's repeated declarations, his trip is solely for the purpose of seeking better friendship with Hitler, Mussolini, and other Axis leaders, and there is no other purpose. However, observers recall that when the Tripartite Pact was signed, the Soviet Union was not included. At that time, the Japanese government expressed hope that Soviet-Japanese relations could improve through Germany's effective mediation. Observers believe that Matsuoka's discussions, especially those with Hitler, will be nothing more than an attempt to have Germany exert pressure on the Soviet Union to conclude a non-aggression pact with Japan. Observers also recall that during the most recent recess of the Japanese Diet, many Diet members suggested that Matsuoka himself travel to Moscow to meet with Stalin to negotiate a non-aggression pact to protect Japan's northern defenses. They believe that this is one way to deal with the increasing pressure from the United States on Japan. Matsuoka should make every effort to address this matter when he passes through Moscow on his way back to Japan. He had already briefly discussed this matter when he was personally received by Stalin in Moscow last week. Observers also stated that Matsuoka has little confidence in concluding a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. This can be seen from his repeated statements that the purpose of his trip is only for "making friends." This trip does not reflect the Japanese government's optimism about improving US-Japanese relations. This can be seen from the Japanese government's deep concern that this trip will hinder US-Japanese relations and obstruct Ambassador Nomura's efforts in Washington. As for the views of Japanese people here on the Foreign Minister, they believe that it is an opportunity for Japan to receive direct European intelligence. This intelligence will be of great benefit to Japan in deciding its future policies. (United Press dispatch, 29th)

Matsuoka to Visit Italy Soon

Berlin, It is rumored that Germany will assist Japan in organizing an East Asian economic system. It is reported that an agreement has been reached in yesterday's meeting between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka. Matsuoka also investigated Japan's economic relations with German Minister of Economic Affairs Funk and had dinner with Chancellor Hitler. It is widely believed that Matsuoka discussed the position of the United States (with particular emphasis on US aid to Britain) and the general situation in the Far East with Hitler and the German Foreign Minister. It is said that the Chinese resistance and methods to end the Sino-Japanese war were also important points of discussion. It is widely believed that the issue of Soviet-Japanese relations was also raised in the Soviet-Japanese talks, as well as the possibility of a Soviet-Japanese alliance against British and American aid to China. (International News Agency dispatch, 29th)

Attacking the United States in Talks in Germany

Berlin, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka strongly attacked the American newspapers in a conversation with reporters yesterday afternoon, saying that American newspapers actually despise Japan's national power and Japan's determination to fight in China. Matsuoka said that the United States cannot understand Japan and the Japanese people, and therefore underestimates Japan. He also said that the attacks of American newspapers cannot shake the confidence of knowledgeable people outside the United States. He also said, "I dare to announce to the world that Japan can fight in China for ten years or even more without fatigue." When asked to comment on the American newspapers' claim that Japan's strength has been exhausted due to the war in China, Matsuoka replied that it is a mistake for Americans to hold this view. Matsuoka reiterated that Japan will not only not weaken in the future, but will become stronger. Because while Japan is busy with the war in China, it is actually continuing to develop its production. The Japanese Foreign Minister clearly stated that if the United States joins the war, Japan will definitely attack it, but he also said that he has not given up hope of making the Pacific Ocean a peaceful ocean. Matsuoka also pointed out that the construction of the "New Order" in both Europe and East Asia must not be hindered. "I have had this fantasy of a 'New Order' for thirty years," so Japan will fight with full determination to build this "New Order." Regarding the question of his talks with Hitler, Matsuoka refused to comment. When asked if he saw a huge map of Germany in the Chancellor's office when he talked with Hitler, and whether they used this map in their negotiations, Matsuoka smiled and said, "I have a map in my heart." When asked if a Japanese-Soviet agreement could be signed, Matsuoka refused to answer, but he said that when he left Tokyo, he knew that Soviet-Japanese relations were continuing to improve. His talks in Moscow did not change his opinion. Matsuoka finally declared that he has had a dream for many years to place Soviet-Japanese relations on a rock-solid foundation. (United Press dispatch, 29th)

British Newspaper Publishes Editorial Advising Matsuoka

The London Daily Telegraph, in its editorial on the revolution in Yugoslavia, offered some advice to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka. It said: "Mr. Matsuoka, you have chosen a very interesting time to visit Europe, arriving on the day that a European country recalled its soul. As a wise man, you should realize what is happening. The world has been weary and confused for many years, without expressing itself. The rulers of Germany, Italy, and Japan are vying to expand their territories. This may have been a good idea before 1940, but today the world has leaned up and woken up. What is discovered in one country will quickly spread to all countries. Now that the world has its own opinions, it will expel the dictators who only know how to fight and do not want anything else. The tide has turned, and those who hold guns and want to hold on to them must change direction. The Nazi's public pronouncements on the South were instantly reduced to ashes in the flames of popular anger. In the same week, Britain's lease of naval and air force bases to the United States was signed, and both parties to the agreement are determined that this should be a permanent reality. What is tied to this is not only the safety of those who signed the agreement." (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

### Municipal Council Board Elections; Rumors of Increasing Number of Seats; Expansion from Fourteen to Eighteen Seats; It Is Said That Relevant Countries Have Not Fully Agreed

According to news obtained by foreigners yesterday morning, the Municipal Council is currently considering several plans to reallocate the number of seats on the Municipal Council Board. In addition to discussing the proposals put forward by various parties, the Council has also considered changing the method of determining the number of directors. According to a source, one of the plans under consideration by the Council is to increase the number of directors by four, from fourteen to eighteen. It is said that the Japanese side has agreed to this plan. The allocation method is as follows: four each for England, the United States, China, and Japan, one for Germany, and one for a neutral country. Whether this plan or other plans can be implemented depends on whether the relevant countries can unanimously agree. It is said that any such agreement is of a temporary nature. At the same time as this plan, it is said that the Chairman of the Board has two votes. If the votes for or against each director are equally divided at the Council meeting, the Chairman can use his second vote to make a decision. Another feature of this plan is that the Chairman will be either British or American. It is said that the Council hopes to make a decision on this issue before the Council elections.

Rumor That British Candidates Have Been Nominated

The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" stated that there have been rumors in recent days that the British, American, and Japanese sides in this city are conducting various discussions to change the seats on the Municipal Council Board. However, according to inquiries today (the 29th), the British community has already nominated five British director candidates. Therefore, the outcome of this year's Council Board elections is still uncertain. It is said that the five candidates for the British directors are the current British directors Casevitz (Chairman of the Municipal Council), Powell, Hiley, Mitchell, and McDonald. However, an official of the Municipal Council refused to disclose the names of the British directors who have been nominated this morning. It is said that there may be changes to the nominated candidates, so the Bureau is inconvenient to disclose their names until the nomination period has expired.

Agenda of Taxpayers' Meeting Announced

The Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that the following proposals will be submitted for discussion at the annual meeting of taxpayers to be held on April 17 at the Public Stand of the Racecourse: (A special meeting of taxpayers convened by the Bureau will be held at 2:30 pm on the same day before the annual meeting.) (1) To elect Judge Hallimick as Chairman of the meeting; (2) To elect Mr. Bethslay as Secretary of the meeting; (3) The effective rules of procedure of the previous annual meeting will be used this year and will remain in effect until the next annual meeting; (4) To elect Mr. Ashbek as the Land Committee member for the next year; (5) To elect Mr. Hellay, Dr. Dunn, Dr. Boerrensen, and Dr. Mingside as Directors of the Public Hospital; (6) To approve the Municipal Council's report and accounts for 1940; (7) To approve the Municipal Council's budget for 1941, together with all its recommendations, and to authorize the Bureau to collect and supplement the proposed taxes and fees. Furthermore, if deemed appropriate, to approve the Bureau to raise an amount not exceeding 9 million yuan or the equivalent thereof, to cover the various items specified in the temporary budget.

Special Meeting to Ratify Changes to Board

According to the "New Voice News Agency", as announced by the Municipal Council yesterday, a special meeting of taxpayers will be held at 2:00 pm on April 17, before the annual taxpayers' meeting. Although the agenda of the special meeting has not been announced, sources revealed that the important agenda of the special meeting may be related to the change in the number of directors on the Board. In other words, the reorganization of the Municipal Council Board will be recognized by the special meeting, and then the usual annual meeting of Western taxpayers will proceed. In addition, when the special meeting of foreign taxpayers was held on February 5 this year, Chairman Casevitz announced the formation of a tax system research committee to resolve the tax system issue. It is now said that the committee has ceased its work, and it is expected that the report and opinions it drafted will be submitted to the special meeting for discussion on April 17 to end the tax collection issue within the concession. In general, the special meeting on April 17 will be very short, probably less than an hour, and will be completed. In fact, this special meeting is nothing more than a prelude to the taxpayers' annual meeting, and its significance is far less important than the last special meeting.

### Coal Ball Factory Labor Strike Resolved Late Last Night

### Yesterday's Commemoration of Revolutionary Martyrs; The City was Solemn and Respectful; All Circles Encouraged Each Other to Be More Loyal and Steadfast

Yesterday was the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, which was designated by the Central Government as the Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial Day (including the martyrdom of Deng Zhongyuan, the martyrdom of Chen Ying Shi, the martyrdom of Liao Zhongkai, the martyrdom of Zhu Zhixin, the death of Huang Keqiang, and the death of Hu Hanmin. All commemorative days will be held together). All sectors of the population in this city followed the regulations of the National Government and, under the leadership of the City Party Department, expressed their respect for the great achievements of the martyrs by lowering the flag to half-mast, suspending entertainment banquets, and making solemn commemorations. Because of the special environment of Shanghai, no large-scale ceremonies were held. On the one hand, the campaign of saving the country through frugality was promoted spontaneously, and on the other hand, the national policy of resisting aggression and building the country was firmly supported. Therefore, yesterday, the entire city, in the atmosphere of drizzle, showed an even more solemn and respectful scene. The people's hearts were inspired, and they deeply believed that the final victory was just around the corner. In addition, yesterday, a large number of patriotic leaflets were found on various roads in this city, such as Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Joffre, Bubbling Well Road, Nanking Road, and Avenue Lafayette, all of which were posted on utility poles and walls.

### The French Concession Authorities Will Make Every Effort to Obtain Rice Transport Vessels; Joint Distribution of Arriving Rice by the Two Concessions; More Than 200 Rice Shops Demand Guarantees

The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reported that the Municipal Council has announced that it will soon set up a subcommittee to charter vessels to transport 15,000 to 20,000 tons of rice per month from Rangoon to Shanghai until the situation improves. As for the French Concession, an official of the Municipal Council stated that although the Bureau would not directly participate in the chartering of vessels, it has expressed its willingness to cooperate fully with the Municipal Council to cope with the general rice situation. It is said that the French Concession authorities will do their utmost to obtain vessels controlled by the French government to transport rice from Vietnam to this city. When the rice arrives, the two Bureaus will cooperate in its distribution.

Rice Shops Demand

Regarding the case of Wan Yuan Rice Shop on Shanxi Road being charged with exceeding the price limit and sentenced to imprisonment the day before yesterday, the rice shops throughout the city believe that there is no guarantee for their business. Yesterday afternoon, more than 200 businesses went to the guild to ask for instructions and demand guarantees. A member of the guild instructed them to wait for the authorities to resolve the matter fairly before they dispersed.

Warehouse Inventory

According to the list reported by the Bean and Rice Industry Guild on the 26th of this month to the Municipal Council, as of the same date, the total inventory of rice in the warehouses in Pudong, Hongkou, and the two concessions south of the Suzhou Creek was 841,275 bags, an increase of 38,370 bags compared to the report one week earlier.

Public Warehouse Demands Payment

The Shanghai Food Rice Public Warehouse Committee, since resolving to order the first batch of 80,000 bags of warehouse rice, has been contacted by the responsible persons of the committee in all directions to negotiate prices. It is now heard that the contract has been completely finalized and signed with Jie Fu Foreign Company. The batch of warehouse rice is expected to be shipped from Rangoon and arrive in Shanghai in mid-May. As for the collection of funds for the purchase of warehouse rice from various industries, the five gold industry has remitted 11,542.5 yuan, the spinning mill industry has remitted 30,000 yuan, and the bean and grain industry has remitted 86,175 yuan, totaling 6,774,605 yuan including the previous collections. However, among the bean and grain industry, the Guangbang Shenshou Hall was supposed to allocate 2,500 bags, but only promised to undertake 745 bags and paid for 425 bags. The Chaozhou Sugar and Grocery Industry was supposed to allocate 2,500 bags, but only promised 1,000 bags and has not yet paid. In addition, the rice industry and the Quanzhang Guild have not made any firm commitments. A letter has been sent to them urging them to raise the full amount as originally allocated and pay it immediately to avoid delays.

### Restrictions on Electricity Reduction Will Be Changed

The Shanghai Electric Power Company, due to the lack of fuel, previously obtained the consent of the Municipal Council to announce that all users whose electricity consumption exceeds 1,000 degrees per month must reduce it by 30 percent. Although this method has been implemented, it is not scientific, and it is particularly preferential to Japanese businesses while it strikes at Chinese businesses.

Also Unfair

Therefore, the company specially invited experts from China, England, and Japan to form a special committee to study the fairest and most appropriate method. After several weeks of detailed discussion of various reports on the electricity consumption of users throughout the city, the committee has divided all users in the city into ten categories. Among them, in addition to various undertakings related to social security, it has been decided to temporarily not restrict their needs. It is said that the supply methods for the remaining categories have also been largely

Drafted Completely

Therefore, the task of the committee will be completed in the shortest possible time. As for the general amount of electricity reduction, it is heard that it may be more than the announced 30 percent. However, the details have not been released. After the new proposed method is fully completed, it will be approved by the Municipal Council and implemented. At that time, the temporary method of electricity reduction will be announced.

### South China Route; British Ships Increase Fares; Increase of 10 to 15 Percent; Fares from South China to Shanghai to be Determined Separately

Since the loss of the various ports along the Yangtze River in China, the Yangtze River routes of third countries have been tacitly abandoned. Although the North and South China routes of British merchants have also been severely hit, Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire are still trying to maintain them. Business on the North China route is slightly inferior, while transportation on the South China route is more prosperous than before. Due to the sharp reduction in foreign exchange, freight rates have been changed from Chinese currency to Hong Kong dollars, and they have been increased again and again. The prices of ship tickets have also risen again and again, still calculated in Chinese currency. It has been found that the ticket prices were recently increased starting from November 1st of last year. It has only been four months since then, and the two companies have suddenly decided to increase them again, to be implemented starting on the 7th of the month (April) (Monday). The new price list is recorded below.

South China Route

Shanghai to Wenzhou: First class (i.e., official cabin) 55 yuan, second class (i.e., room cabin) 45 yuan, third class (i.e., hammock) 35 yuan, fourth class (i.e., steerage) 20 yuan.

Shanghai-Fang Line

### Abolition of Discounts for Large Volume Gas Users

According to the Municipal Council, the Bureau has approved the Shanghai Gas Company to abolish the discount payment method for large volume gas users. From now on, the gas costs for all users will be collected according to the current charging rate, that is, 3 cents per ten cubic feet, plus a surcharge.

When the Bureau approved the increase of the surcharge proposed by the Mulla Fire Company to 250 percent in the first month of this year, it considered several items regarding the proposed changes to the conditions of supply. The purpose of the above-mentioned amendments is to limit the consumption of gas, because the greater the consumption of gas, the greater the need for coal and fuel oil. The Bureau also studied the company's charging situation and concluded that it is unfair to ordinary household users if large users still enjoy the benefits of discounts as usual. Therefore, the discount method should be abolished and allowed to be implemented from the time users use gas after the next meter reading.

At about 5:30 pm on the day before yesterday (the 28th), he was returning to his residence after school, riding in his own chartered car passing through the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road, when he suddenly encountered two kidnappers.

### Famous Female Writer Xie Bingxin in Chongqing: Rumors of Her Death in Yunnan Untrue; Ba Jin's Recent Letter Describes Her Current Condition

According to a Reuters dispatch from Peiping on the 27th, Xie Bingxin, a professor at the Southwest Associated University and a famous female writer, recently passed away in Kunming due to a lung ailment. Xie is one of the earliest renowned female writers since China's May Fourth Movement. Her works, such as the early novel "Superman" and poetry collection "Stars," and later essays such as "To Young Readers," have a wide readership. She was even elected as a member of the National Political Council this year. News of her death caused shock and concern among various circles, especially in cultural circles. However, some people wondered why, if Xie passed away in Kunming, the news originated from Peiping. Therefore, this reporter visited Xie's literary friends in Shanghai, but none of them had heard of this. Xie's sister-in-law, who currently resides in Shanghai, also stated that it was absolutely untrue, confirming that the Peiping dispatch was a groundless rumor. According to writer Xu Diaofu, who is close to Xie, Xie's whereabouts are actually in Chongqing, not Kunming. She is currently in Chongqing with her husband, Wu Wenzao (a famous Chinese professor), participating in the National Political Council. Furthermore, he had received a letter from the writer Ba Jin, currently in Sichuan, dated March 13, which mentioned Xie's recent situation, but did not mention any lung ailment. This proves that the aforementioned rumor is untrue. Xu already sent a letter to Chongqing yesterday to inquire about the situation, and it is expected that Xie will soon send a reply to Shanghai, which should clarify the truth.

### Two Concessions Under Special Alert Since Last Night; To Be Lifted at 8 PM Tonight

It was widely rumored in Shanghai yesterday that the two concessions would implement special martial law starting at 8 PM last night, leading the general public to believe that martial law would be implemented earlier. In fact, the police departments of the two concessions, due to yesterday being the Memorial Day for the Yellow Flower Mound Martyrs and today being the Anniversary of the National Government's Return to Nanjing, feared that unscrupulous elements would take the opportunity to cause trouble. Therefore, it was decided to implement an emergency alert starting last night. In addition to deploying more detectives to patrol and search, non-essential locations on various roads were temporarily sealed off. Dance halls closed early last night. Today, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the French Defense Forces of the French Concession will be fully mobilized for security. This special temporary alert will be lifted at 8 PM tonight. However, the curfew hours will remain the same as before.

### Assassin of Wang Yanqin, Du Hongbin, Commits Suicide: After the Incident, He Lodged in a Small Inn Under an Assumed Name; With Nowhere to Turn, He Drank Poison

Wang Yanqin, the second adopted daughter of the famous Shanghai opera singer Wang Xiaoxin, was twenty years old this year and also a famous Shanghai opera actress. She fell in love with Du Hongbin (twenty-two years old this year), a student of Liu Ziyun, a colleague in the same troupe and from Pudong. They made a vow of love and took a commemorative photo with intertwined arms. They even received the consent of Wang Xiaoxin and his wife, who allowed Yanqin to marry Du Hongbin. However, recently, Yanqin's sister-in-law, Wang Yaqin, fell ill and was invited to the Shanghai Opera Troupe (i.e., the Queen's Theater) to perform in her place, suddenly developing a heart for

Abandoning the Old and Loving the New.

She fell in love with another person, forming a love triangle, and disregarded Du. Du requested a formal engagement with Yanqin, but was firmly rejected. She even cut up the photos they had taken together and returned them to Du, indicating her determination to break up. Du, heartbroken and resentful, harbored the thought of killing her to vent his anger. At 6 PM on the 23rd of this month, Yanqin was walking from the Shanghai Opera Troupe back to her residence in the Ju'an Lane, on Rue Marco Polo, when she passed the Great World and was

Lured into

the Great World Open-Air Cinema. Du suddenly produced a sharp blade and stabbed Yanqin in the throat, causing her death. Du fled after the incident, and the French Concession Police issued an arrest warrant. The details have already been reported in this newspaper, and the incident caused a sensation in Shanghai. Du Hongbin, after the incident, fled east and hid everywhere, knowing that he would have to pay for murder with his life and could not escape the law. He then conceived the idea of suicide. On the afternoon of the 27th, he

Bought Poison

and sneaked into the Ronghua Small Inn at 146 Avenue des Soeurs, opposite the Franco-Chinese School, under the assumed name of opening room number 20 on the pretext of borrowing a place to stay. He committed suicide by taking poison. At 9 PM that night, he was poisoned, and the tea boy discovered it and reported it to the police. He was sent to the Guangci Hospital, but it was too late to save him. He died at noon the next day. Later, the detectives found his pass and photo on his person and realized that he was the culprit who killed Wang Yanqin. They notified Wang Xiaoxin and Liu Ziyun to identify him.

It was confirmed that it was indeed him. The body was taken to the coroner's office for examination. However, the deceased had no family members. His parents had died early, and his aunt had sent Du to Liu Ziyun to learn Shanghai opera. It is unknown who will claim his body for burial, which is truly lamentable.

### Tao Guangchuan Still in Custody; Family Visited

Tao Guangchuan, principal of the Lequn Middle School at 970 Avenue Haig, was suddenly taken away from his office at the school yesterday afternoon by four foreigners, together with police officers. He is currently detained at the Central Police Station. When the foreigners and police officers arrived, they monitored the actions of all teachers and staff and conducted a thorough search of the school, but found nothing. Tao's family, upon hearing the news, went to the police station twice that night to visit him, and again yesterday morning. They found Tao to be quite comfortable. Tao is the founder of the school and is usually enthusiastic about education, with no other activities. His arrest may be due to a misunderstanding, and it is expected that he will be released soon.

### After Jack La Lai's Arrest, the U.S. Court Will Continue the Trial; Possible Sentence of Eighty-Five Years; After the Sentence is Final, He Will Be Sent Back to the United States for Trial

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Jack La Lai, the "Slot Machine King" of Shanghai, who fled last year to escape justice, was arrested in Hongkou yesterday (the 28th) and detained in the Ward Road Jail. The U.S. Court is preparing to resume the trial next week. Attorney Rogers will defend La Lai. U.S. Court officials stated this morning (the 29th) that La Lai will not be charged with new crimes for jumping bail. However, La Lai has already been charged with operating gambling, and if the investigation is true, he could be sentenced to eighty-five years. It is expected that after La Lai's trial in Shanghai is completed, he will be sent back to Oklahoma, USA, for trial, as he was sentenced to twenty-five years for theft in that state in 1925 and then escaped from prison.

### Culture on Avenue Joffre

— Wei

The Avenue Joffre Cinema is the only paradise for the children nearby. This cinema is built in the style of the Cathay Cinema. It has no balcony, is quite spacious, and the seats are very comfortable. It does not have the dirty and noisy atmosphere of other small cinemas. The films shown are all first-class American films, and most of them have been shown at the Grand Cathay. Occasionally, one or two Chinese films are also shown. Therefore, the audience who want to see movies do not need to go to the Grand Cathay to buy those expensive seats, but wait for them to be shown at the Avenue Joffre. What difference does it make to see them later or earlier? Although the ticket prices at the Avenue Joffre have also risen to fifty cents and seventy cents recently, they are still cheaper than those at the Grand Cathay after all. Every Saturday afternoon and Sunday, the entrance of the cinema is often crowded with countless spectators, with children making up the majority, waiting for the audience inside to leave the venue, and scrambling to rush in to grab the better seats. Because every movie is always so crowded, and the children always skillfully rush to grab seats regardless of everything, the adults are embarrassed to compete with them and have to fall behind.

Because groups of students come and go on this road from morning to night, the business of the Avenue Joffre Cinema is so prosperous, so the nearby shops have also doubled their profits. In the past year, stationery stores, second-hand bookstores, and small bookstalls have been continuously added. Because book prices have risen, most middle school students come here to search for the old textbooks they need. There are five or six second-hand bookstalls here, and there is also a one-room second-hand bookstore that often posts advertisements in the newspapers soliciting basic readers who enjoy reading novels. It is the main base for second-hand books on this road, especially all kinds of new and old novels. The textbooks have the best business on the second-hand bookstalls. These bookstalls are all loaded with books displayed on the roadside using soap boxes. There is also a bookstore that has a particularly large collection of thread-bound, stone-printed, and woodblock-printed ancient books, so its customers are all old gentlemen with glasses and handlebar mustaches. One of the bookstalls is quite large in scale, and most of its customers are students. Whenever the stall owner has something to do or encounters rainy weather, he always hangs a sign on the wall of the stall base, stating that the "bookstore" is closed today due to business or rain, which seems to be a way to attract customers. There is also a bookstall that specializes in selling novels and notebooks that were previously known as 20% discount books. These books are now printed with colorful covers, and the prices are also much more expensive. There is also a branch of the Qiming Bookstore. Qiming rose up with the prosperity of 20% discount books. It initially edited modern creations and sold them at the lowest prices, similar to 20% discount prices, to facilitate the general readers. Now, it mainly focuses on re-translations of world famous works. In addition, it has also compiled and printed many dictionaries, and its business is very developed. In addition, there is also a newspaper and magazine stall. I was initially a regular customer of this newspaper stall, and I got very familiar with the young stall owner. I also wrote a special feature about him. His initial scale was very small, with only a few kinds of newspapers of various sizes. Now, there are all kinds of newspapers and magazines, such as travel magazines, "Tianxia Shi," "West Wind," "Liangyou," and various movie pictorials and songbooks. The young stall owner is a person who lost his job after the war and is self-reliant. I see his newspaper stall gradually expanding and prospering every day, and I often secretly rejoice for him and bless him. (To be continued)

### Grains: Ships Will Be Allocated to Transport Burmese Rice Exclusively; Small Grains Rice Plummets; Another Sixty to Seventy Thousand Bags of Foreign Rice and Corn Arrive in Shanghai

Large quantities of foreign rice have been imported in recent days, which is considerable. As reported in this newspaper, the Java Company's Zesarea arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 28th), bringing a large batch of foreign rice from Hong Kong. According to the company yesterday, what was brought was not foreign rice, but corn (i.e., pearl rice) 4,500 tons, totaling more than 45,000 bags, also produced in Vietnam and transshipped through Hong Kong. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's Tai Sheng arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong with 14,524 bags of foreign rice and 470 bags of corn. Also, the Fusheng arrived at the port yesterday afternoon from Hong Kong with 11,876 bags of foreign rice. Both ships were docked at the Roosevelt Wharf and began unloading yesterday. (Zu)

The price of foreign rice began to fall yesterday, with prices declining uniformly across all grades. The decline was especially significant for small grains rice. The opening price for small grains rice was already following the weak trend of the previous night, and the selling pressure was very strong. The speculators were afraid of the Municipal Council cracking down on excessive price increases and punishing three rice shops including Wan Yuan Rice Shop, and therefore did not dare to openly manipulate the market. Although囤戶 tried to buy at low prices, the brokers who were accomplices were watching the situation. The market eased significantly. The key factor was the rumor that the Municipal Council would allocate ships to transport small grains rice from Yangon to Shanghai, which undermined the rice merchants' excuse for high prices due to transportation problems. Therefore, the decline was greatest for small grains rice. From this, it can be seen that only facts can control facts. As long as the rice market is slightly regulated, it can be guaranteed that the price of rice will not reach today's level. It is still hoped that the Municipal Council will take further effective measures. This is fortunate for the people's livelihood. Yesterday, the opening price for small grains rice fell by 4,000 yuan, then decreased from 3,800 yuan to 3,600 yuan. No. 1 fell from 3,300 yuan to 3,100 yuan, No. 2 from 3,500 yuan to 3,300 yuan, and broken rice to 2,500-2,600 yuan, all down by 200-400 yuan compared to the previous night. Compared to the high prices of the previous day, the drop was as much as 400-600 yuan. Only 6,000-7,000 bags were traded throughout the day, because Japanese merchants stopped and囤戶 were watching. Local real sales were light.

Due to the source of thick and thin粳 and other national rice being rare due to the wind and rain, the sales in stores were still sluggish. In addition, with the falling price of foreign rice, the sellers were unable to reverse the situation, and prices fell by one or two yuan. The opening price for special粳 was 120-123 yuan per斛,昆山粳 from 111-118 yuan, and Qingjiao薄稻 112-113 yuan. Original packages still lacked trading.

Because there was little market货 for glutinous rice, and the inventory was limited, sellers had no intention of selling it cheaply, so although the market was not smooth, the market was still勉定. The prices opened were similar to before. Hong Kong white yuan was still high from 108 yuan to 102-103 yuan, glutinous 菉 from 97 yuan, and broken rice 90 yuan.

### Bank Reserve Committee Reduces Clearing Rate; Effective April 1st; No Interest Paid Beyond the Fixed Amount

The Shanghai Banking Association Reserve Committee sent a letter to each bank yesterday, stating that due to the international situation in Shanghai, the liquidity has increased, and the committee's exchange deposits and interbank deposits have increased, resulting in a significant loss of interest. After consultation with the China Central Bank, the clearing deposit interest rate will be determined according to each bank's usual needs for payment of bills and average deposit situation, and the deposit interest limit will be determined separately. The balance within the limit will be calculated at an annual interest rate of 1.5% for exchange bank deposits, and other interbank deposits will be calculated at an annual interest rate of 1.25%. No interest will be paid on amounts exceeding the limit. It will be effective from April 1st. It is said that the limit of each bank varies, and is stipulated by the committee separately, ranging from several million yuan to tens of thousands of yuan.

The bank reserve committee's clearing deposit interest rate was originally a uniform 3%. Since November 1st last year, the exchange bank deposit has been reduced by 1%, and the改 has been changed to 2%. The interbank deposit outside the exchange bank has been reduced by 1.25%, and the改 has been changed to 1.75%. At that time, each commercial bank had the reason for borrowing the interest reduction of the committee, and implemented the reduction of floating interest. Now the interest rate of current deposits of each bank is only 2-3% per annum. If each bank continues to reduce the deposit interest, it will inevitably promote depositors to use their齊 for other purposes, or it will be used by the bank. One of the two must be the case. At present, many banks have various restrictions outside of the regulations, and each time the change is made, how do they know that there will not be a day when they turn to charge depositors a保管 fee? As each bank is 于效举, it is feared that it will not be avoided. (公)

### Securities - Someone Specially Collects Type Xu

Public and off-market trading: Yesterday's market conditions showed a slightly firm trend overall. Type Xu was the most popular, mainly because Shunchang Trading Company has been specially collecting Type Xu for several days, taking in tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands each day. This has invisibly driven up the market price. Type Bing usually has many bulls due to its lottery drawing on April 10th. Because there are too many bulls, people are selling at high prices, preventing the price from rising. The rest just fluctuated. Yesterday was Saturday, with only one session in the morning.

### Yarn and Flower - Bulls and Bears at a Stalemate - The Yarn Market Hovers

The yarn market has returned to a hovering course, but the contention between bulls and bears remains fierce. Therefore, it is very hesitant, but the actual sales are very dull. Today, the Hong Kong group only had ten bales traded. The rest is entirely a bouncing ball business, everyone kicking it around, which is very lively, but there is absolutely no brilliance. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,394 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,384 yuan. In the afternoon, it was silent due to the weekend. The current yarn market is waiting for new changes before making any major moves up or down. The bulls are looking up because of the high prices of all goods, and the bears are looking down because of narrow sales and sea transportation, with increasing inventory and loans.

Bian Ma (changed horse) opened in the morning, continuing the weak momentum from the previous day. The opening price was 1,389 yuan. After a short while, it rose slightly to 1,388.5 yuan. News then came that gold prices had opened lower, and confidence weakened slightly. Sellers became active, and the price fell to 1,385 yuan. However, once the low price was seen, it did not go any lower, and there was a rebound. Profit-takers and new bulls became active, and the price rose to 1,394 yuan. However, due to poor actual yarn trading, it fell back to 1,392 yuan at the close. It is found that the total transaction volume during the day was 6,010 bales. The amount purchased by each trade group is listed below:

Hong Kong: 10 bales
Other Firms: 6,000 bales

Total: 6,010 bales

### Cotton Market - Manufacturers Waiting and Watching

Yesterday's cotton market was flat and unremarkable, but prices remained firm and high. This is because the inventory in Shanghai is decreasing daily, and it is also quite difficult for foreign cotton to arrive at the port. Types such as American upland cotton are highly valued by the public. Manufacturers are not actively purchasing, and due to the Saturday situation, a total of 550 bales of foreign cotton and 1,036 bales of Chinese cotton were traded. The price increased by one yuan, resulting in less enthusiastic trading. The trading prices for yesterday are recorded below:

Hui Shi Deng: 290.0, 100 bales from the same industry
Huo Ji Hua: 192.5, Also, 134 bales
Huo Cao Bao: 197.0, Also, 152 bales
Peng Jia Po: 279.0, Also, 100 bales
Also: 281.0, Also, 10 bales
Also, High Grade: 290.0, Also, 100 bales
Tai Cang Cao: 207.0, Also, 150 bales
Also: 30.0, Also, 600 bales
Mei Mi De Lin: 390.0, Also, 150 bales

The New York cotton market rose initially due to large-scale buying and news from Washington that the Department of Agriculture Committee had approved cotton and wheat loans. However, it later fell slightly due to some profit-taking. As a result, the closing price was higher than the previous day by sixteen or seventeen pounds.

Also, on the same day, a telegram from New York stated that the statistics from August 1 of last year to February 28 of this year are recorded below (per bale of 500 pounds):

Total listed: 9,681,000 bales
Cotton used by yarn factories: 6,798,000 bales
Total exports: 796,000 bales
To Japan: 78,000 bales
To China: 30,100 bales
To England: 338,000 bales
To Germany: 39,100 bales
Current inventory: 6,43,000 bales

The Indian cotton market rose in the morning due to strong support from major players, then fell due to cotton merchants hedging sales. Later, it rose again due to speculative buying, and then fell again due to public liquidation and weak stocks. Yesterday's closing price fell by three to six rupees. It is also predicted that the opening price today will still be firm, with a rise of two and a half rupees expected.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is still in a state of hesitant progress. Most factories are taking a wait-and-see attitude and are not interested in purchasing, but the market is still relatively firm and tending to advance.

### Sugar Market - The Rising Trend of Sugar is Getting Stronger

According to a Dutch telegram yesterday, the price of Dutch Red Long sugar was US$2.85. According to C.I.F. practice, the rising trend of crude white sugar is gaining momentum due to the continued absorption by new hoarders. According to the association's trading, the initial price of Grade 24 crude white sugar was 88 yuan to 87.8 yuan, then rose to 88.5 yuan to 89 yuan, an increase of 1.8 yuan. The price for April 10 delivery was 88.2 yuan to 88.5 yuan, then rose to 89 yuan, 89.5 yuan, and 89.4 yuan. The price for April 20 delivery was 88.8 yuan, 89 yuan, and 89.5 yuan, then further rose to 90 yuan, 90.05 yuan, and 90.3 yuan, an increase of 1.2 yuan to 1.5 yuan. Dutch Red sugar was 68.8 yuan to 69 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan. Taikoo Refined White B Mark was 89 yuan to 90 yuan, an increase of 1.4 yuan. DY Mark was 84.5 yuan to 85.5 yuan, an increase of 1.1 yuan. HX Mark was 83.8 yuan to 84.5 yuan. This Grade 1 ice sugar was 114 yuan, and Jingming ice sugar was 115 yuan, both up 1 yuan.

### Coal - Hai Feng Coal on the Black Market - Increased by Another 30 Yuan

The shortage of white coal is becoming increasingly acute. The reason for this is still the large-scale hoarding by industry insiders who are holding back from selling. The listed price is only nominal, and shopkeepers have to search for warehouse receipts at high prices to meet market demand. As a result, the black market price is rising step by step. Yesterday, the old warehouse receipt for Hai Feng white coal opened at 350 yuan, an increase of 30 yuan. The price for delivering screened lumps to customers from the street door shop was 368 yuan per ton, it is said.

### Metals - Tin Ingots and Steel Bars Are Both Rising

Tin Ingots: The market price of 99.9% pure tin ingots has also risen sharply along with the rapid rise in the price of various standard goods. Yesterday, the market price was already calling for 5,000 yuan, and there was no spot available for wholesale. It is found that the sources of this product in Singapore and Hong Kong have long been cut off. Only the inventory on this street can meet the market demand. Therefore, the industry is in high spirits, and market prices are rising steadily.

Steel Bars: Although the construction industry is slow to take interest in the trading of ribbed steel bars and the customer uptake is limited, the holders of the goods are still thinking high because of the lack of goods on the market and the lack of incoming supplies. The standard market price is rising rather than falling. The reason for this is that, in addition to the hoarders actively buying, the intention of the holders to hoard for profit should also be considered. Therefore, yesterday the market was selling at 2,000 yuan outside the pass.

### Silk and Tea - Green Tea Has Slight Sales

In the foreign firms' tea trade, only uncolored Fengmei and Xia Mu goods are being sold slightly by American firms. Yesterday, Yih Ho and Jin Long, etc., bought more than a hundred boxes of this green tea at a price of 260 yuan to 285 yuan. In addition, there are also telegrams sent out by industry insiders to promote colorless Zhenmei green tea, but it has not yet started to be handled. On the 29th, 64 pieces of tea arrived from Hong Kong.

### Piece Goods - White Straight Tribute Serge is Expensive

White straight tribute serge is extremely scarce on the market, and the factory does not produce it. The shipping of goods from the West has been greatly reduced, and the old inventory is limited. Although the outgoing prices are said to be high, sales are actually still good. As a result, supply is falling short of demand, and the market is trending upwards. The standard market price is rising again and again. Yesterday, good Hua 22 old brand white straight tribute serge was sold wholesale at 50 yuan per yard. Ordinary British-made goods were sold at around 40 yuan. The Futai brand was sold at 32 yuan, the first-class East goods were sold at 31 yuan, the second-class goods were sold at 27 or 28 yuan, and the third-class goods were sold at 23 or 24 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Items - Cowhide and Wool are Imported

On the 29th, 548 pieces of hemp came from Kalgan, and 277 pieces of wool and 90 pieces of cowhide came from Hong Kong.

### North and South Goods - Shandong Twigs Down 10 Yuan

The trend of miscellaneous road twigs has turned weak recently due to narrower sales. The goods that arrived earlier from Chaohuo will be opened up at the water's edge, so the recent batch that has been opened has already dropped by more than 10 yuan. The market price has also followed the decline. Yesterday, Shandong twigs were sold for 72 yuan, and Haikou twigs were sold for 40 yuan. Other bird leaf twigs had few customers, and there was a lack of formal market, it is said.

### Medicinal Materials - Hawthorn Slices Are Gradually Becoming More Active

Since the opening price of hawthorn slices became tight, the take-up by the Hong Kong and Guangdong groups has gradually become active, so the market has turned stronger. Yesterday, the market price for pure goods was 44 yuan, and the price for raw goods was 42 yuan. It is found that there has been a lack of arrivals recently, and the market inventory is not very high. The market is expected to continue to tighten.

### Corn

— Gao Jiannong

Since Columbus first opened this "treasure" that is the New World in 1492 AD, how many priceless treasures have flowed to all parts of the world, as a source of nourishment, healing, and refreshment for us mortals! Corn! "Pearl" rice – yet another excellent example.

Corn, also known as pearl rice or baogu (husk grain), is most commonly called bangzi in northern China: the character is not found in dictionaries. The origin of the name cannot be traced; perhaps it is because the mature ear resembles a bangchui (club), and the word bang was corrupted into bang (stick). The Spanish call it "Maiz," which is probably the original name used by the American Indians. Corn was first introduced to China, of course, at the end of the Ming Dynasty: but was it introduced by the Portuguese from Macau? Or, like sweet potatoes, was it transplanted from Luzon? Now, I am making every effort to search, but I am still struggling to find a shred of evidence. As for the names of the heroes who imported or popularized it—for example, we at least still know that Jin Xuezeng and Lin Huailan imported sweet potatoes—there is no need to mention them.

The earliest Chinese record of corn is no more than Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, in which he says: "Corn originates from the West, and it is rare for people to plant it. Its leaves and seedlings are all similar to sorghum, fat and short, and also similar to Job's tears. The seedlings are one to four feet high. In June or July, it blooms and forms ears like shattered wheat. The center of the seedling produces another bud, like the shape of a lou fish, with whiskers hanging from the bud. After a long time, the bud breaks and the seeds come out, clustered together. The seeds are also as large as zhanzi (fodder), and can be stir-fried and eaten: the stir-fried seeds turn white, like stir-fried glutinous rice." Xu Wending Gong also said in the Complete Book of Agricultural Administration: "Shu zha (sorghum) did not exist in ancient times, but later generations obtained its seeds from other places... There is another kind of corn, sometimes called yu mai (jade wheat) or yu shu shu (jade sorghum comb), which was also obtained from other places. The words "mi (rice)," "mai (wheat)," and "shu shu (sorghum comb)" are all borrowed names." Li Shizhen said that it "originated in the West," and Xu Wending Gong said that it "was also obtained from other places." Of course, this can prove that corn is not native to China, but how do we know that its motherland is in the New World? The following quotations are taken from the gist of The Biological World by the Frenchman Contiere, not in the original order, and are supplemented and explained.

The ancient Egyptians and Indians had no term for corn, and in religion, no trace can be found of it being used for sacrifices or other rituals. The Greeks and Romans did not recognize what it was—even our Chinese "One Farmer Produces Nine Grains:" which includes millet, sorghum, beans, wheat, etc., does not have any trace of corn. Undoubtedly, its ancestral home is not on the Old Continent, but in the Americas!

When the white race discovered America and explored its various treasures in various places, they could see this lush, prosperous, majestic, and tall corn everywhere, from the mouth of the La Plata River in Argentina in the south to Hudson Bay in Canada in the north. Moreover, the Indians have special names for it in each tribe: not only do they rely on it for the only three meals a day, but also when they breathe their last breath, they also take its ears as a very important material to be buried with them in the tomb: this may be to take it as the capital when traveling in their country, or to prepare it as a bribe to appease the anger of the bull-headed Apar—the Indians also believe that the iron-faced and selfless Yama can be softened with bribes, which is really strange—not only that, the great god whom the Indians respect for their merits and virtues is also the "Corn God:" every year there is a fixed date for worshiping the god, and none of the various mysterious offerings displayed are made with corn flour (to be continued)

### A Message to Children on Children's Day

— Cheng Ming

Dear Children!

Children's Day on April 4th is almost here. In this vibrant festival, the spring light has already enveloped you. You have innocent hearts and lively spirits. The goddess of happiness is swaying before you. Your future is bright, your hopes are boundless, dear children! This auspicious day for children is your time of great joy. Together, under the care of your parents and the guidance of your teachers, you are tasting the sweetness of life. This happy life is already yours. Who does not yearn for a happy life? Who does not recognize that life is precious? Your clear, agile, and clean minds will certainly not forget this. But I earnestly wish you, may you forever hold onto this happy outlook on life, and use your keen minds in the future to strive for the survival of the masses and the happiness of society. Therefore, I hope you will not act rashly or blindly follow. Happiness does not come from prayer, nor is it given by others. It must be earned through your own efforts. Your goal is to first seek the wholesome development of your own body and mind, and then strive for the happiness of all people!

You are the vital force of today's society. You must strive with perseverance and with an active and persistent spirit to win your ultimate victory. Do not be afraid, do not retreat. Dear children! This dark universe awaits you to forge a path of light, and the sleeping and intoxicated lives await your innocence to awaken them, to warm their cold hearts...

Dear children! Please forgive me, do not despise, do not reject, but accept my shallow good intentions! Wishing you a radiant flower of life!

### Utilizing Spring Break

— Ying Dong

This year's spring break is somewhat different from previous years, with some changes in the timing. Starting from the Huanghuagang Memorial on March 29th, there will be nine consecutive days of vacation, ending on April 6th. Nine days may not seem long, but they are not short either. We can certainly use these nine days of vacation to make academic progress. As the saying goes, "The plan for the year is made in spring, and the plan for the day is made in the morning." Understanding this, we should seize this spring break and make full use of it. If we want to utilize the spring break, then the first step, children, is to make a plan.

First, even though the school does not assign spring break homework, we should still automatically decide what work to do during the nine-day holiday. Whether it is reading or writing, the mini-exams have already been taken, so we can find the subjects in which we did not do well and review them during the spring break. If the mini-exams are after the spring break, then it is best to use this spring break to prepare for the exams. As for all extracurricular assignments, such as calligraphy, diaries, and arithmetic exercises, even if the teacher has not assigned them, we should still do the same amount of work as usual and not neglect them because of the vacation. In this way, even if it is only nine days, there will be considerable progress.

Of course, we cannot read all day long, so we can set a schedule for the nine-day vacation. As I see it, we should review our lessons every morning, no matter what, and use the afternoon for exercise or spring outings. In the past, we would go on hiking trips during spring break, but now that the war is not yet over, we are not allowed to go on hiking trips due to the environment. We can only go to a few parks to play, or invite some friends to exercise together, such as playing table tennis, kicking a small ball, or discussing academic topics in an informal way. This can improve our intellectual abilities and keep our bodies healthy. In short, going to the countryside for a spring outing and flying kites are all beneficial activities that everyone can do according to their preferences.

In general, spring break is a great time, suitable for both reading and recreation. The mornings are especially valuable, with fresh air and sharp minds, making it easier to make progress in reading and writing. Therefore, during the spring break, we should at least make full use of every morning as a time for academic progress. I hope that all the children will not waste it!

### Children's Song Game

Spring has arrived,

The weather is good,

The grass is green,

What kind of bird is this?

One day, the sun and the wind were competing in ability. After much effort, they could not decide who was superior. Later, they saw an old man walking slowly on the road. The wind suggested, "Whoever can make the old man on the road take off his clothes will be the winner." The sun immediately agreed.

The wind began to exert its force, blowing desperately, but the more fiercely the wind blew, the tighter the old man held his clothes. Although the wind was exhausted, it could not make the old man take off his clothes. When the sun released its warm rays, the old man felt warmer and automatically took off his clothes. As a result, the wind failed.

Therefore, the sun said to the wind with great pride and a tone of instruction, "Relying on violence to coerce others is useless. It is better to be gentle!"

### Contentment

— Tong You

Someone asked Franklin, "Why are rich people not happy either?" Franklin saw a basket of apples, took one and handed it to a child playing in the room. The child took it with his small hands. Franklin quickly gave him another one, and the child reached out his other hand to take it. Franklin picked up an even bigger one and gave it to him, but the child still wanted to use his hands to take it, and all three apples fell to the ground. The child began to cry.

Then Franklin said, "You see, the child cannot be satisfied with his possessions. This is why rich people are not happy."

After reading the story above, we know that aggressors are not happy either.

### Kang Yuan Toy Essay Contest: Parents' Section Second Place: My Child and Kang Yuan Toys

— Zheng Linong

I have been drifting on a desert island for three full years. Watching the children grow up, I realize that I have entered middle age. On their innocent smiling faces, I feel a lost youth revive beside me.

I miss my hometown, a hometown with the scent of earth: where the green hills lean, the small river winds, with boundless fields bathed in the quiet sunlight. In the spring, we flew kites; in the summer, we caught grasshoppers; on autumn nights, I counted the stars and made a firefly lantern, falling asleep with a sky full of stars; the days when it snowed in winter were the happiest—the universe was a large factory, with endless toys for you to pick up.

Now I am confined to a small room, the outdoors is a noisy street, and the alleyways are even more chaotic. For three years, my mood has become even more aged. Returning home, seeing two children living in an unclean environment, I feel like I am committing a sin. My wife's suggestion that we shouldn't let them play outside to avoid picking up bad habits like arguing and eating snacks is reasonable. However, a few feet around indoors, in their young and growing hearts, the world is too small. Like two withered flowers, without the nourishment of sunlight and rain, I doubt that they will have full and healthy spirits in the future.

Near Christmas last year, I brought them back from the company, along with a pile of dreams; they clamored to buy toys. They didn't know that the high prices had shattered the joy of being a father. But when I recalled my childhood, when getting a paper-made spinning top under a Price's candle was my only treasure, I had an unspeakable sense of loss. Although the world in my hometown was vast, what I cannot forget is the anticipation of the candle burning out, and the joy of blowing it out and smashing it. So, it is not too much for the children to be amazed by the colorful displays in the shop windows, to tell me, to ask me for them. One day, I made up my mind and reluctantly added a toy item to the budget. I thought: in this city, it doesn't matter if the grass grows in May without butterflies; the children should have a "moving butterfly." And when the new seedlings are planted, the sound of frogs in the paddy fields still plays the symphony of the quiet night, but the children have come to Shanghai far away from them. I should buy them a "jumping frog" and tell them about the music of thousands of frogs singing together.

For two months, the dull air in the small room has suddenly been broken, because I bought a lot of Kang Yuan toys. This is not to say that I got a raise at the store, but rather that Kang Yuan products are ten times cheaper than imported ones, which is affordable for the average person. The children throw them away when they are tired of playing, and then want to play again after a while. Kang Yuan products are mostly made of tinplate and are not easily damaged. So, we have raised several "chickens and ducklings," and the "golden bugs" and "butterflies" are also flying. We turned the rattan chair upside down to serve as a fence, and the washbasin as a pond. The pastoral scenery of my hometown seems to be right in front of me, and we are the masters again!

Ah Da is in the second grade and seems to understand the meaning of war. He has taken in the "fire tank," "giant airplane," and "machine gun" and turned them into his personal mechanized infantry unit, refusing to let his younger brother play with them. But his younger brother likes "climbing monkeys" and "crocodiles," probably because he has been to the Zhaofeng Park Zoo and wanted to bring a monkey back? He also likes to use crocodiles to fight his brother's infantry, and firmly believes that crocodiles have swallowed everything. Watching the crocodile crawl along, it amuses us as well.

"One day, Ah Da may really drive a tank and gallop on the battlefield?" I thought, leaning on the bed.

### Contract Terms for Stars

— Qinghui

Hollywood film magazines often have unfathomable news telling us whether it is fact or promotion, making outsiders feel lost. The many strange and interesting conditions in the contracts of stars are one of them.

Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle, a comedic star who was extremely popular during the silent film era, had a special clause in his contract stating: he was not allowed to show a smile on the screen, otherwise, he would be sued in court for breach of contract, so Roscoe Arbuckle was known as the "stone face comedian."

Eddie Cantor's contract stipulated that he was not allowed to grow a mustache, because his charm lies in the special size of his mouth. If he grew a mustache, wouldn't he be concealing his characteristics?

Eddie Quillan's contract stipulated that he must have two weeks of complete rest between filming two films. During this period, no matter how important things are in the company, even a phone call to ask him is not allowed. This is also a unique aspect of the conditions.

Joan Crawford's contract is the most detailed, specifying everything from when to arrive at the set to when to return home, which also shows one aspect of her personality.

Greta Garbo and Ronald Colman never liked outsiders to visit during filming, so they stipulated in the contract that the company could not force them to show their true faces.

Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's contracts all had clearly stated that their body weight must be above or below a certain weight. If it exceeded this, there would be a risk of termination. Therefore, the two had to pay special attention to their physical activities to avoid gaining or losing weight.

Wallace Beery was a famous "clock watcher." As long as the time arrived, he would disregard everything, no matter how important the scene was or how much money the set cost. He always walked out with large strides as if it had nothing to do with him. People in the company had no choice because the contract stipulated it.

The late great star Lon Chaney, whom they called the magician of makeup, was regarded as a treasure by the company, but he was not allowed to show his true face. Therefore, to see his true face, you had to first get through to the company.

In short, the clauses in the contracts of famous Hollywood stars often have imaginative ideas that are hard to believe. In fact, they are all just "promotion" methods.

### A Striving Outlook on Life

— Zong Yu

"The way is near, but sought far away; the matter is easy, but sought in difficulty." If you think of solutions this way, the more you think, the more confused you become. Then you sigh and say, "I really have no way." Who knows that the solution is laughing at you in front of you for being useless!

Chapter Four: Swallows Kick Flying Flowers, Falling on the Dancing Banquet

Li Xin thought they wanted money, so he ordered a servant to go inside and get some. He also asked the big man, "Where do you come from? This young lady's skills are really good. What is she to you?" The big man replied, "My surname is Tong, and she is my younger sister. We came here selling entertainment all the way." Li Xin nodded and said, "Very good." The servant had already brought out a plate of patterned silver, containing fifty taels of silver, and placed it on the table. Li Xin pointed to the silver and said to the two, "This silver is a gift from me to you. Please don't be polite and accept it." Upon hearing this, the big man smiled at the red-clothed woman, but did not reply. Li Xin thought they thought it was too little and was about to say more when the big man had already walked to Li Xin's side and said softly, "We have a few important words to say to Master Li. Please dismiss the people around you so that we can speak frankly." Li Xin was taken aback upon hearing this and ordered the servants nearby to leave together. The big man still hesitated to speak. How could Li Xin not suspect something? He couldn't help but ask, "What do you have to say? Just say it. There is no one else here. Please rest assured." The big man looked around again before saying, "What I said to Master Li just now was not entirely true. Please forgive me. We are not performers. We are actually leaders from Qing Shi Mountain. I am Tong Tianbao, and she is my younger sister, Tong Tianfeng, who is known as 'Red Maiden.' Because we were originally street performers, we later went to Qing Shi Mountain, gathered a group of brothers, and started a bandit career. Now we hear that Li Zicheng and others in Shaanxi have raised the banner of rebellion and are gaining momentum. We intend to respond here and strive for the world in the future and share wealth. However, we feel that our momentum is still not great enough. We still need someone with a well-established reputation to raise the banner and call upon the people from all directions. We know that young Master Li has the name of Mengchang and Pingyuan here, and heroes are willing to join him. If Master Li agrees to join us in the uprising, the land of Henan will not be difficult to obtain. Now the fate of the Ming Dynasty is coming to an end. Heroes and extraordinary people in the grass roots should take advantage of the time to rise. Master Li is originally the First Pingyuan Master. Why not take advantage of the situation to plan for the world?" (25)

### Don't Underestimate "Fighting Heroes"

— Zhuan Yuan

The martial arts profession is divided into martial students, martial actresses, martial warriors, martial others, and "fighting heroes." "Fighting heroes" is another name for "upper and lower hands." This type of role is a supporting role in martial arts plays, such as the many teachers in "Celebrating Ding Zhu" and the many leaders in "The Linked Ring," all of which belong to the short-handed category of "fighting heroes." Long-armored plays include the eight Cao camp generals in "Changban Slope" and the many hammer generals in "Eight Great Hammers." (However, these eight people cannot be completely filled by "fighting heroes" because the famous generals among them must still be played by martial warriors or second-rate martial students, and only unimportant generals are filled by "fighting heroes.")

According to the custom of the pear garden, most of the people who lead the martial arts are wrestling painted faces. Although the backstage has people in charge, all matters, large and small, must still be discussed and handled with them. Most of the "fighting heroes" never study singing, reciting, acting, and speaking. There are two professional terms among insiders: "The upper hand is afraid of fighting Pan He, and the lower hand is afraid of Wudang Mountain." This is because the upper and lower hands cannot speak, and the role of the family general in "Fighting Pan He" is usually played by the upper hand, who should have the line, "Something bad has happened! The two old masters have been shot to death by random arrows." Also, the role of the guard in "Wudang Mountain" is usually played by the lower hand, who should have the line, "It's still early. The people fighting on the ring haven't come yet." Therefore, these two roles are feared by both the upper and lower hands.

When the famous martial student Li Chunlai was in his prime, he often brought his so-called "Hum and Ha Generals," "Four Great Vajras," and sixteen "Somersault Insects." Shen Yunchun, Ju Dekui, Tan Yongkui, and others all belonged to the ranks of the two generals and four vajras. The so-called "Somersault Insects" were also people with high martial arts skills and outstanding kung fu.
