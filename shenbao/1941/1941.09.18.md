### 海戰狀態業已存在　美艦實行護航氷島　俾租借案下物品迅速運英　諾克斯海長宣布廣大政策

Reuters, Washington, 17th – Starting from midnight on the 1st, the US Atlantic Fleet has taken over the armed protection of all goods under the lend-lease program between the US and Iceland. Responsible parties all consider this to be actual escorting. Secretary of the Navy Knox's remarks that US warships will take protective actions for ships between America and Iceland are seen by naval strategists here as even broader than President Roosevelt's announced policy of shooting at German ships on sight. The full protection of merchant ships is escorting, and there is no other way to ensure their protection in the event of a sudden attack. To carry out the work of protecting valuable supplies to aid Britain, the US Atlantic Fleet currently has more than 125 warships, including three old battleships. However, new warships are continuously being added, and a portion of the Pacific Fleet is also being transferred, so the strength of the Atlantic Fleet is gradually increasing. At the same time, the Navy Department claims that all warships permitted by law have been ordered, with the aim of creating the largest navy under one flag the world has ever seen. Two of the six newly built 35,000-ton dreadnought battleships, the North Carolina and Washington, have already entered service this month. Therefore, the United States has a total of seventeen battleships in active service. The Navy Department also stated that an investigation into warships under construction and already ordered has revealed accelerated progress in naval construction on both oceans. Since January 1, 1940, a total of 2,831 warships and auxiliary ships have been ordered, at a cost of $7,234,261,178.

Reuters, Washington, 17th – President Roosevelt announced a new method yesterday while hosting journalists, eliminating time-consuming procedures to ensure that goods under the lend-lease program can be shipped out quickly. However, the President declined to specify whether the Navy would actually escort military supplies overseas. The President stated that he has designated Stettinius as a special assistant with the authority to stamp lend-lease documents with the President's seal, thereby reducing the 24-hour delay in the White House, and the time between application and final shipment. When asked whether escorting is one method of protecting war supplies to anti-Axis countries, the President replied that he had fully explained the matter, but non-tactical experts should not assume that there is only one method of protection. The President further answered other questions, stating that all naval developments will depend on future announcements regarding the continued attacks on American merchant ships, or encounters between American warships and submarines or raiders in the western Atlantic. A reporter also asked whether the progress of the lend-lease program could be considered disappointing. The President replied in the negative.

Reuters, Washington, 17th – On the 1st, when President Roosevelt was asked whether his current protection of lend-lease supplies to Britain was a form of escorting, he replied that amateur strategists should not assume that there is only one way to provide such protection. This statement has sparked various speculations. People here discussed last night, suggesting that the North Atlantic now has a "steel corridor" of ships, aircraft, and naval artillery to protect supplies to Britain. Secretary of the Navy Knox's remarks on the 1st have led the general public to believe that the US Navy has already implemented escorting, and the President has not denied this belief. Therefore, according to their comments, it can be considered that the North Atlantic now has a "safe harbor." According to this plan, cruisers, destroyers, and submarine chasers, airplanes will patrol in sections on a regular basis. They will be responsible for policing the corridor designated for ships transporting supplies. However, whether this kind of policing can deter raiders from entering the patrol area is still doubtful.

International News Service, Washington, 17th – Because US ships will fire immediately, a state of naval warfare between the US and Germany actually already exists. If Hitler decides to accept President Roosevelt's challenge, then it is expected that events will soon occur. However, it is generally anticipated that US ships will not necessarily encounter Italian warships. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated that all ships of all countries carrying lend-lease military supplies in the waters between North America and near Iceland will be protected by the US fleet. As a result of Knox's statement, the US has effectively dispatched convoys to travel back and forth. It is reported that the German authorities will disregard Knox's declaration and continue to insist that the blockade of the North Atlantic is a legitimate act. It is claimed that the German government has not yet received notification clarifying the US maritime defense zone.

Reuters, New York, 17th – Undersecretary of the Navy Bard stated yesterday that the events of the past few days have clearly indicated that war will be imposed on the United States. German submarines are now closer to the American coast, and four-engine bombers have sunk a ship within miles of land in the Western Hemisphere. The possibility of enemy ships launching attacks, which was unthinkable a year ago, is now a cause for concern.

### 美總統將邀宴　温莎公爵夫婦

United Press, Washington, 17th – It was announced here yesterday that President Roosevelt will host an informal dinner for the Duke and Duchess of Windsor on September 25. They will be traveling through Washington on their way to a ranch in Canada. White House Secretary O'Laughlin said that this meeting is due to the President's long-standing friendship with the Duke.

### 試探談話進行聲中　美不鬆弛經濟制裁　限制日對了拉丁美洲貿易

Reuters, Washington, 17th – Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that there is no new news regarding the US-Japan exploratory talks.

Reuters, Washington, 17th – The Foreign Affairs Correspondence Weekly, known for its well-informed sources, states that there is no opinion in Washington that the United States will relax its current economic sanctions against Japan while the current exploratory US-Japan talks are underway. Not only is there no such opinion, but more sanctions will be imposed on Japan. US government experts have begun seeking appropriate ways to restrict Japan's trade with Latin America. Japan is a major customer of Chilean nitrate and Argentine wool. A report recently drafted in Washington by an authoritative figure has suggested that the United States should purchase as much of the aforementioned South American surplus goods as possible to prevent them from falling into Japanese hands. In addition, there is a suggestion currently under discussion to prohibit Japan from refueling at Latin American ports. These economic experts believe that Japan can only sustain its operations for a limited period, approximately six months. After six months, its military strength will be greatly weakened due to the lack of necessary war materials.

United Press, New York, 17th – Howard Newspaper's famous political commentator Sims stated yesterday that the truth behind Japan's current willingness to make concessions is that Prime Minister Konoe recently received a report from his advisors stating that Japan currently has no hope of fighting and winning against the United States. Sims said that Konoe was informed that unless Britain and the Soviet Union collapse, forcing the United States to independently support the situation in Europe and the Atlantic, Japan has no possibility of fighting the United States in the Pacific. He also said that since Berlin intensified its pressure on Japan to provide military assistance, Konoe has been cautious in handling matters. Although Japanese industry has made great progress, it is still insufficient to launch a large-scale war with a major power like the United States. Sims also said that Konoe received a report stating that if war breaks out between Japan and the United States, Japan may initially gain benefits, but even if it wins initially, it will eventually be unable to replenish destroyed ships, tanks, and airplanes.

United Press, Honolulu, 17th – Davis, General Manager of the Shanghai "North-China Daily News," arrived here yesterday on a transport, transiting to the East. He predicted that if the Soviet Union continues to deter German forces, Japan will eventually withdraw from the Axis. He said that this will not only mediate the disputes between Japan and the United States and ensure peace in the Pacific, but also that he believes that "some coordination will inevitably be established" between the two countries.

United Press, Tokyo, 17th – The Emperor of Japan received Foreign Minister Toyoda yesterday and listened to reports on diplomatic matters.

United Press, Vatican City, 17th – Roosevelt's personal representative to the Vatican, Tittmann, denied yesterday the Japanese reports that he and Pope Pius XII had discussed the possibility of the Pope mediating US-Japan relations to ensure peace in the Pacific.

中國官民大爲激勵

United Press, Chongqing, 17th – Today, Chinese official circles and the public are greatly encouraged by President Roosevelt's strong declaration of the scope of American lend-lease aid to China. Although the details announced by President Roosevelt are not new, the fact that the President is releasing the details at this time makes Chinese observers believe that the United States will not reach a compromise with Japan that is detrimental to China. One observer said, "We are confident that since the American public has learned of the extent of American aid to China in the war against Japan, they will not allow any concessions to Japan that would render this aid futile." However, it is certainly understood here that a sense of unease will continue to exist until the US-Japan talks have reached a stalemate or breakdown.

United Press, San Francisco, 17th – Ding, advisor to the Central Propaganda Department of the Central Government in Chongqing, declared today that China fears that the United States may sell out China. Ding is here for a month-long visit. He stated, "Any action by the United States to reconcile with Japan would be contrary to the interests of China."

Reuters, Chongqing, 17th – Recent news from Washington regarding this issue has been received here. The main points are roughly as follows: (1) The United States will never reach a settlement with Japan at the expense of China. (2) The United States will fully consult with China on matters concerning Chinese rights and interests. (3) The United States will continue its policy of aiding China. (4) The United States will continue to exert economic pressure on Japan.

美總統羅斯福援華報告原文

Reuters, Washington, 17th – On the 1st, President Roosevelt reported to Congress on the progress of the lend-lease program. There was a section on China, the original text of which is as follows: "As with Britain, the main task in China is to improve, expand and stabilize the long-distance transport lines that must be managed for the transport of essential national defense goods. The U.S. Maritime Commission has issued cargo ships to transport the required goods, taking the long route to Rangoon in Burma, which is the only port into Free China. Land transportation into Free China requires the use of highways, railways, waterways, and air routes. Basic steps have now been taken to stabilize this essential route. Paving materials have been transported to China for the purpose of resurfacing the Yunnan-Burma Road, the lifeline of China, and large numbers of trucks under the lend-lease program are now operating on this artery of Chinese military and civilian life. The required gasoline, motor oil, parts and tires are now being shipped on schedule for use by these trucks, etc. on this road. The unlimited manpower that China uses to independently build the Yunnan-Burma Highway is now being used under this lend-lease program with equipment and materials to rush the construction of the railway in the malarial Yunnan province. A mission under the guidance of the U.S. Public Health Service is departing to protect the lives and health of workers on this important project. The protection of China's highways, railways, airports and cities from aerial attacks requires a large number of new fighter planes. Orders under the lend-lease program have been placed in the past quarter to ship this equipment as early as possible to enhance China's air force. The United States has organized a military mission that is currently on its way to Free China to discuss with the Chinese authorities the uses of the national defense weapons already specified and scheduled for delivery under the lend-lease program. It is anticipated that the mission's observations and its consultations with Chinese army leaders will determine the types of national defense equipment best suited to China's combat situation, and make effective use of the equipment already supplied."

### 美日諒解先決條件　唯有日軍退出中國　美決不傷害對華友誼

United Press, Washington, 17th – California Democratic Congressman Izac said yesterday that the signs that Japan no longer believes Germany can win are becoming increasingly obvious, and therefore a comprehensive resolution of various issues between the democratic countries and Japan seems promising. He also said that he believes the United States will not conclude an agreement with Japan that is detrimental to China, because the Congress and the President's administration are true friends of the Chinese people and will never do anything to harm that friendship. He also said that he has not received definite information regarding the US-Japan talks, but he dares to assert that the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops from China will be a prerequisite for any understanding.

### 英美應負起　遠東警察使命　現可抽調大西洋艦隊　用以穩定太平洋局勢

United Press New York Air Mail – Before our two-ocean navy is completed, the acute danger in the Far East is sufficient to threaten the outbreak of a great war in the Pacific at any time. The security of the United States is of utmost importance in this region. We cannot help but wonder whether the United States dares to dispatch a limited fleet to the Pacific to restore order. In other words, can Britain and the United States draw troops from the front line of the Atlantic Fleet to reinforce the Pacific without seriously impacting the future Atlantic War? If this were before the development of modern air forces, we ourselves would answer no. However, today, the situation has fundamentally changed. The author holds the opposite of the general view, deeply believes that the naval strength of the Atlantic can be drawn to have a beneficial use to stabilize the situation in the Pacific. If American people have a clear understanding of the facts, they will increase the confidence in a force already in the Far East. Today, the land-based air power of the United States is based on Greenland and Iceland, and large numbers of air force are also preparing to use it in the Atlantic. And the range of power in air space is also improving day by day, in the midst of great progress. In this environment, the Atlantic War has become a problem of air force main battle, with only a few teams of destroyers to help, you can complete the task. In this stage, the air force and destroyers can resist the Nazi blockade of the British Isles, without a large fleet. Therefore, at home in this situation, the main battleships and cruisers in the Atlantic, is a hero with no place to use its strength. The task of the main battleship, in fighting with the enemy's main battleship, and Germany has no main battleship, so the Atlantic campaign, it is not necessary to have the main battleship participate. Since the sinking of the giant warship "Bismarck", Germany has only the sister ship "Tirpitz" and a few cruisers, the power of which is so weak, like lonely clouds and wild cranes, dare to venture for a moment? Under the power search of the Royal Air Force, there is no escape, "Tirpitz" even if it竄 into the Atlantic, its fate will be the same as the "Bismarck", the British Air Force without the help of the first-line warships, is enough to destroy it in one fell swoop, The fleets of Italy and Germany, in this case, are a hidden worry for the Atlantic. If the Nazis want these fleets to have freedom of action in the Atlantic, they must first conquer Suez and Gibraltar, but Hitler is in the midst of the Soviet-German war, and is unable to launch this new campaign. Based on the above reasons, the main battleship has nothing to do in the Atlantic, and there is a sigh of flesh growing back on the thighs. Recently, a military expert wrote an article in the National Magazine, suggesting that the anti-Nazi Navy should step up its harassment of Hitler's coast and attack Germany's coastal trade. He stated the matter in great detail, but unfortunately, this kind of suggestion is really feasible to say but not to do. If the British Navy can take action against European ports, this plan is really great, but the British Navy has not yet taken action, why? The British Navy cannot break through the air force blockade and approach the mainland, so before the German naval power is eliminated, the navy will have no power to launch this real war in Europe. When will this opportunity come, it is not known. Even if the time has come, only by attacking the European continent with the fleet can you get twice the result with half the effort, For the time being, what the British Navy does in Europe is, at best, to make "hit-and-run" invasions in Genoa, Les Restes and other places. If we expand this kind of invasion and make an isolated stake under the air force power of the enemy, it is unimaginable. Thus, the fleet is greatly restricted in the Atlantic, both in terms of attack and defense, so the majority of the British and American joint fleets can be drawn to the Pacific to carry out police missions. All views that are unwilling to draw troops from the Atlantic Fleet to the Pacific are unrealistic and only reflect the psychology of not daring to trust the power of the Air Force. The opportunity to concentrate the fleet in the Pacific is a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity and deserves to be cherished. Why? Asia's Pacific, is one of the few naval combat areas, its shape is not reduced by the development of land-based air power, The Far East is vast, and the area near the military base is controlled by the air force, The real air force power needs the cooperation of bombers, Japan does have more long-range large destroyers than other countries, but it is not enough to say to obtain unbreakable air power. Therefore, if Japan is on bad terms with the anti-Japanese countries, there is still a vast battlefield in焉, Japan and the United States have the same problem, relying on the navy and underestimating the air force. Therefore, the battlefield in the Far East, as in the past, The British and American Navy can take old strategies to deal with the war plan, to say that the American naval aircraft, the strength is superior in quality and can fly to the Japanese air force base to compete with the Japanese air force. Although, the winning situation of the Asian Pacific Navy, is only in a transitional period, cannot remain unchanged for long. Japan has deeply felt the important point of the air force power, we can recognize that in this atmosphere, Japan is rushing long-range aircraft, in order to seize the power of the territory in the Pacific a平, A few years later, we will see the surge of Japanese air force power, which can be compared with the air force of European powers, At that time, the Pacific in the Far East, will not be the battlefield of the surface fleet competition, just like the North Sea and the Aegean Sea today are not the naval combat area. For this reason, the U.S. Navy should take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to exert naval power at the moment, Whether we are going to exert power on the front and break Japan, or passively drive the aggressors out of the Pacific in a frightening way, Either way can be used to build the Navy's expenses, proving not to be wasted, In any case, if you want to keep the Navy for future use, the view is most illogical, when "the future comes, we must reduce the use of the Navy by more than half矣, We must make the construction of the Navy compensated as soon as possible, otherwise, the time will pass and we will be powerless矣.

### 巴拿馬向德　要求賠償

### 哈立法克斯廣播　戰後英美關係

Reuters, London, 17th – British Ambassador Halifax gave a broadcast in London yesterday, describing the efforts of various parts of the United States to produce aid for Britain, and said that American aid to Britain will increase day by day. Everyone in the United States is now gradually aware of the relationship between this war and their lives, and may make more important decisions at any time. We should not observe its actions. Of course, it should be decided by the Americans themselves. The sooner, the sooner Hitler's demise. As for the Anglo-American relations after the war, then, the United States must be able to establish its existing friendship and understanding on a solid foundation, otherwise the future of the world is almost hopeless. Anglo-American relations must be dominated by this kind of friendship. If Britain and the United States cooperate to contribute their special strengths, we will be able to restore the old ideas of courage, integrity, and freedom that have been respected by the world for a thousand years.

### 海牙德當局下令　沒收荷王室財產　荷蘭女王對此並不關懷

Haitong News Agency, Amsterdam, 17th – The German Security Commissioner in the Netherlands has ordered that all property of the House of Orange in the Netherlands be confiscated and used for good deeds, because Queen Wilhelmina has joined hands with Britain and the Soviet Union, insulted the German army, and instigated popular riots, so she has become a public enemy of the new Europe, and the property of the House of Orange should be confiscated.

Reuters, Berlin, 17th – According to the German news agency Hague, all the property of the Queen of the Netherlands has been ordered to be seized by the German occupation authorities in the Netherlands. This order also applies to the property of members of the Dutch royal family. The German confiscation is based on the order to punish those who incite anti-German sentiment. The communiqué issued by the German commissioner accuses "the former Queen of the Netherlands of always adhering to the Bolshevik and capitalist fronts, and not participating in the unity of the new Europe."

Reuters, London, 17th – Regarding the confiscation of Dutch royal property in the Netherlands in violation of international law, Dutch officials here claim that after the Queen of the Netherlands left the Netherlands, she lost contact with the Netherlands and does not know who is continuing to manage the royal property. However, the Queen of the Netherlands is not concerned about this, but is more concerned about the welfare of the Dutch nation and people. On the days when the Queen of the Netherlands is in office, she is always working for national affairs and the liberation of her country.

Editorial

### Invaluable Gains of the Past Ten Years

China has encountered an unprecedented catastrophe in its history, now exactly ten years past; these ten years of blood and tears have proven that China is not only certain to be saved but has already become the primary stabilizing force in the Far East. Looking back on the past while considering the present, one must first solemnly point out that these are all the results of the Chinese government’s leaders having vision, preparation, and proper leadership. When the crisis first began, it was precisely the time when both internal and external environments were at their most dangerous. The Chinese government exhausted all possible means to gain the necessary time to strengthen its national defense capabilities. Finally, when the day arrived, it was able to plunge the opponent into an irrecoverable abyss, laying a solid foundation for China's resurgence and self-strengthening. Therefore, the Chinese people, looking back on the past, are inevitably filled with grief, but their mood is extremely stable, deeply believing that by continuing to advance along the established path, they will certainly reach final success. On the 10th of this month, China's highest military leader, in an interview with a reporter from the Associated Press, reiterated China's stance of continuing the war and expressed that China would make the necessary sacrifices until the Far East and the entire world truly achieve lasting and fair peace. This is China's unwavering national policy. The difficult experiences of the past ten years are sufficient to prove that it will inevitably lead to a bright future.

Because China has been able to consistently grasp the correct national policy and has not wavered in the slightest due to the ups and downs of international phenomena, its international standing has risen sharply to this day, forming an important pillar of the democratic front. Just imagine, in the turbulent international changes of the past two years, if China had not single-handedly and resolutely supported the Eastern half of the Far East, the world crisis would have been unimaginable long ago. On one hand, without waiting for the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the Soviet Union's strategic strongholds and economic resources in the Far East would have been on the verge of danger. On the other hand, Britain and the United States would have long been threatened by the navy that was called the world's third-largest. From the Dutch East Indies to the Philippines to Hawaii, there would have been reason to be uneasy. There is no need to shy away from the fact that the Japanese navy still exists completely, but a navy requires many conditions to support it, including sufficient munitions production, advanced scientific techniques, and abundant operational resources, especially coal, steel, oil, etc., in order to help a huge fleet exert its power. Japan's munitions have already been largely consumed on the Chinese battlefield, and it is now facing the misfortune of an embargo. In particular, the supply of manpower is facing great difficulties due to the long-term war in China. Its originally weak air force has also suffered significant losses in recent years, and replenishment will be extremely difficult in the future, while the importance of the air force in naval warfare has already been proven by the sinking of the German battleship Bismarck. Therefore, China's struggle is for its own independence and survival and also for the protection of the rights and interests of democratic countries. The Axis alliance originally had a plan to go straight down to India from Central Asia to open up east-west connections. The activities of Germany and Italy in Near Eastern Muslim countries have long been an open secret. In recent years, Japan has also been catching up rapidly, echoing the troublemakers in Southwest Asia. In their minds, they had long believed that after occupying the Near East, Central Asia, and even Southeast Asia, they could maintain a long-term stalemate with the democratic countries and no longer fear any maritime blockade. The reason why this plan has not yet been realized is that in the West, Britain and the Soviet Union took preemptive action, nipping disturbances in the bud, while in the East, it is mostly due to the effects of China's long-term arduous struggle.

The above is not simply boasting about China's contributions to democratic countries and the Soviet Union. On the other hand, the reason why China's war effort and nation-building have been able to achieve the current good results is that, in addition to its own efforts, it should first thank friendly countries, especially Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, for their sympathy and assistance. The crisis in the Far East almost became irreparable in the past due to the lack of international cooperation, but the results of the evolution over the past ten years have finally enabled all countries that oppose aggression to stand together on the same battle line and jointly struggle. This is extremely gratifying. China's war effort is completely consistent with the interests of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union; Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union also have the necessity to cooperate with China to contain Axis aggression. Recently, although Britain and the Soviet Union themselves are in the midst of arduous struggles, they have not interrupted their assistance to China. British public opinion even suggests that in order to help China, it is willing to reduce aid to Britain and the Soviet Union in the Lend-Lease Act. On the American side, even though it has sacrificed some valuable energy and time for exploratory talks, it has never neglected to send military missions to China to strengthen military and economic aid to China. This shows that the combination of this ABCD group is based on moral resonance and consistency of interests, and for the sake of practical needs, its future development will only become stronger and stronger. The recent Chinese people's expression of trust in the United States' position in dealing with Japan's diplomatic offensive is based on this, and they also believe that the US-Japan talks will not yield any results because of this.

In summary, China's current full of hope for success comes from ten years of hardship and five years of struggle. It has full confidence in the recovery of lost territory and the integrity of sovereignty. Moreover, as a result of the evolution of the international situation, it has already proven that China's victory is by no means just its own victory but must be the common victory of the anti-aggression front.

### After Arrival of U.S. Planes and Heavy Artillery, China Will Immediately Launch a General Counteroffensive, English-Language Chu Pao Predicts

Chongqing: The English-language Chu Pao predicted today that the long-awaited start of China's general counteroffensive is not far away. The newspaper stated, "The delegation led by Major General Magruder came to China to study the prospects of national defense, which will be brighter than it is now. China's counteroffensive power has been hindered by the lack of aircraft and heavy artillery, which is well known to the public. Now the United States is particularly strengthening the two weakest links in this Chinese war machine. Soon, the Chinese army, which has been fighting bare-handed for four years, will be able to look forward to the long-awaited general counteroffensive. If we pay attention to the various aids that the United States has given us in the past, we cannot believe that the United States can sacrifice China and compromise with Japan. Concessions to Japan and aid to China are absolutely irreconcilable. Therefore, the Chinese people will not doubt that Washington will take measures that will lose and damage Chinese sovereignty. President Truman's Lend-Lease report further increases the confidence of the United States. (Associated Press, 17th)

### Sun Ke Predicts That the Four Strongest Powers After the War Will Be China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, Which Will Eventually Form an Alliance

Hong Kong, 17th, International News Agency: Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, delivered a speech here, predicting that democracy will eventually defeat Hitlerism and that there will only be four strongest powers in the world after the war, namely China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Democratic countries generally recognize that China's war effort is fulfilling its share of responsibility in the world war. He stated, "Although there is no formal agreement between China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, their interests are the same. We are now cooperating with each other to fight the Axis powers. I firmly believe that China will not be defeated." He also stated that China has not concluded an agreement with other democratic countries, not because China's diplomacy lacks activity. When the time is right, China will conclude an agreement, just as Britain immediately signed a military alliance with the Soviet Union when the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union. Sun Ke predicted, "The Sino-Japanese War may end after June or after the European war. Britain and the United States may obtain China's consent at that time to restrain the Japanese army (especially the navy), and then try to conclude a peace agreement. Otherwise, the war must wait until the end of the European war before it can end." Sun also said that even if the Japanese army withdraws from the mainland of China and the Northeast, he does not believe that peace can be negotiated with Japan at present, because Japan can manipulate China's economic resources through "economic cooperation" and permanently prevent it from becoming a strong country. According to Sun's interpretation, after the Japanese army withdraws from China, the Japanese navy can still control the Chinese coast and continue to blockade China arbitrarily. He also said that only by disarming Japan can there be lasting peace in the Far East. Not only does China mean this, but the opinions of Britain and the United States are also stated in the two countries' Eight-Point Joint Declaration. He also believes that Japan will disregard its own military weakness and attack Siberia in the north and Thailand, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines in the south, but Japan will eventually fail and be disarmed, just like other aggressor countries.

### Northwest Route Red Army Counter-Offensive, Situation Stabilized at Leningrad, Attempt to Cross the River by Germans Foiled, Soviet Troops Recapture Ramasaari Island

TASS, Leningrad, 17th: The situation in Leningrad has stabilized. The German attempt to cross the V River to attack Leningrad has completely failed. Initially, German troops occupied some small islands in the V River, preparing to cross to the right bank to attack Leningrad. The Red Army launched a counter-offensive, with large units swimming and sailing across the river, fiercely attacking the German troops on the islands. After intense fighting, the enemy was unable to hold and abandoned the islands, which were then occupied by our forces. Currently, the enemy is heavily bombarding the islands, but the Red Army is holding firm and not retreating.

Reuters, Moscow, 17th: The German army planned to use some small islands near Leningrad and one bank of the V River as a transition point for further advances towards the city. However, after fierce battles, this plan of the German army has been thwarted. Initially, the Soviet army made preparations under the cover of artillery fire and began the attack at dawn, crossing the river with the help of boats and pontoons, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with grenades and bayonets, and storming the islands. A young woman from the Leningrad volunteer army also participated in the assault, charging with a rifle and grenades. The German army resisted fiercely but was ultimately forced to withdraw from the islands. The Soviet army now controls both banks of the river. In this battle, the German army suffered hundreds of casualties and lost a large number of war materials. They are now firing indiscriminately at the islands to vent their anger.

International News Service, Berlin, 17th: A communiqué from the Führer's headquarters stated that in the Battle of Leningrad, German forces annihilated 18 Soviet divisions, totaling 270,000 men. The defenses of Moscow have been weakened. German forces are now rapidly crossing the Dnieper River, overcoming difficult terrain, and advancing towards the Crimean Peninsula. German sources claim that the major defeat of Soviet forces on the northern front indicates the early collapse of Soviet resistance in the Leningrad area. Over 53,000 Soviet soldiers have been captured, along with 320 tanks, 700 field guns, and large quantities of military supplies seized by German forces. It is reported that General Buch's forces, after defeating nine Soviet divisions, annihilated another nine, all belonging to the Red Army's 11th, 27th, and 34th armies. These Red Army units were urgently transferred to the front to break through the encirclement between the Valdai Hills and the Lovatt River south of Lake Ilmen to relieve Leningrad. General Buch's forces, covered by strong air support, launched an attack, shooting down 96 Soviet aircraft. A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that the German victory in the Leningrad area is the most appropriate response to the US delegation led by Harriman to the Soviet Union. This will be followed by similar responses to give the US delegation something to think about. The spokesperson also said, "Knox is Roosevelt's mouthpiece."

TASS, Moscow, 17th: The Red Army recaptured Ramasaari Island in Lake Ladoga yesterday, killing over 800 Finnish soldiers.

Tank Battles Break Out Near Leningrad

TASS, Moscow, 17th: A tank battle broke out near Leningrad yesterday. A Soviet tank brigade destroyed 48 enemy tanks and 27 artillery pieces.

Reuters, Stockholm, 17th: Swedish newspapers report from Berlin that German forces have occupied Vormsi Island between Dagö Island and the Estonian mainland. Finnish sources claim to have broken Soviet resistance in the Olonets region but admit that encircled Soviet troops are still holding out in many places. The Finnish side also claims that Finnish troops are advancing on two fronts in the swamp area, while Soviet forces are making efforts to improve their defenses in Petrozavodsk. Swedish newspapers also report German sources as saying that Finnish artillery units are currently shelling Leningrad, with multiple breaches in the city's outer defenses and the encirclement line around the city, 15 to 20 kilometers from the city center, almost complete. On the southern front, German forces are advancing through Konotop and Kremenchug, aiming to cut off communications with Kiev and encircle an area as large as the German region of Saxony (with an area of 5,900 square miles).

TASS, Northwest Route, 17th: The Red Star newspaper, in an article titled "Battles in the Karelian Isthmus," states that fascists built defenses on a certain high ground, controlling a highway and a parallel railway line. The enemy repeatedly cut off our units, forcing them into the wetlands between the railway and the highway and surrounding them. Recently, our reinforcements arrived and immediately launched a counter-attack against the enemy, following closely behind tanks. The enemy was unable to sustain the pressure and withdrew from the high ground, retreating into the wetlands. Our units then launched a coordinated attack, concentrating artillery fire on the enemy. The enemy completely collapsed, leaving behind 400 bodies, two ammunition depots, artillery pieces, tanks, machine guns, automatic rifles, and a large number of documents were seized.

TASS, Leningrad Region, 17th: The enemy attempted to cut off the Red Army's communication lines and encircle them in the Northwest Route (Leningrad Region). The enemy's attempt has completely failed due to the Red Army's fierce counter-offensive. During the counter-offensive, the Red Army, led by Molochayev, fought valiantly. After fierce battles, a regiment of the enemy's 30th Infantry Division was annihilated, and the enemy's 19th Tank Division also suffered heavy losses. Furthermore, the German attempt to occupy the key town of Slaudina on the Northwest Route was repelled by the Red Army. The Red Army finally launched a counter-offensive, annihilating one and a half battalions of German troops.

TASS, Moscow, 17th: Air battles near Leningrad continue to be intense. The Soviet Air Force, led by Danilov, shot down 16 enemy aircraft in one day. Other flying generals also made significant contributions.

Soviet Union Releases War Report: Navy Continues to Achieve Victories

TASS, Moscow, 17th: The Soviet Information Bureau released a night war report on the 16th, stating that during the day, our troops engaged the enemy along the entire front. Our air force attacked enemy mechanized units, infantry units, artillery units, and enemy airfields, and bombed a pontoon bridge. On the 14th, 29 enemy aircraft were destroyed in air battles and on airfields. Our side lost 18 aircraft. According to accurate information, on the 15th, warships of our Northern Fleet destroyed three enemy freighters. The previous report of two was inaccurate.

TASS, Moscow, 17th: In the Barents Sea area, our torpedo boats and submarines sank two enemy transport ships.

TASS, Moscow, 17th: German forces again attempted to land on Saaremaa Island in the Baltic Sea yesterday but were again repelled by the Red Army, suffering heavy casualties. In the first landing operation, five enemy transport ships were destroyed, with a total displacement of 28,000 tons.

Reuters, Leningrad, 17th: The most noteworthy of the disclosures in the Soviet communiqué last night is the continued control of the entrance to the Gulf of Finland by the Soviet base. The German attempt to land on Saaremaa Island off the coast of Estonia has been repelled by the combined efforts of the Soviet fleet, aircraft, and shore artillery. The Soviet army has continued to defend Hanko Island outside the Gulf of Finland for a long time, and Soviet newspapers have frequently reported on the continuous capture of small islands at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland by the Soviet army. The German attempt to land on Saaremaa Island this time can be seen as related to the overall German plan to attack Leningrad. If the German side fails to control at least a part of the Gulf of Finland, it will be extremely difficult to use its navy to assist in the attack on Leningrad. At present, the Soviet side can still use the sailors of its Baltic Fleet to perform many local tasks in defending Leningrad. However, if German warships launch a large-scale attack into the Gulf of Finland, these sailors will board ships to participate in a major sea battle. Judging from the number of ships deployed by the German army when attempting to land on Saaremaa Island, the German side clearly had a serious attempt to seize the Soviet base, but it was ultimately repelled due to the resolute response of the Soviet army. This matter is very important.

Severe Winter is Approaching, German Troops Are Increasingly Trapped

TASS, Kiev, 17th: The German army originally planned to hold a banquet at the Continental Hotel in Kiev on July 25 and also scheduled a military parade in the streets of Kiev on August 5. However, the facts have proven that this dream of the German side has been shattered. The German commander then claimed that he would "lead troops into Kiev on September 1, using the city as a gift to the German Führer." However, this boastful tone also proved ineffective. Thirty thousand German soldiers have already dug their own graves near Kiev. In two months, the terrain near Kiev has changed dramatically, as countless fascist cross tombstones are everywhere. Currently, the autumn rainy season has already begun, and severe winter is approaching, making the situation of the German army even more difficult. The German commander recently issued an encouraging order, saying, "Soldiers, severe winter is approaching. Are you going to sit and wait to die in the forests? Kiev is a beautiful city. You should strive to capture it to spend the cold winter." Around the city of Kiev, the Red Army and the people have built several lines of strong defenses. The enemy can only look at this great city and its people with longing.

TASS, Moscow, 17th: A Pravda editorial stated, "When Hitler and his brutal gang invaded the Soviet Union, they hoped to end the war before autumn and winter. This hope has become a bubble. The Red Army's resistance is growing stronger, and it has inflicted heavy losses on the enemy's manpower and material resources. Fascist thugs will soon learn of the difficulties of winter warfare in Russia. The letters of fascist soldiers on the eve of winter reveal extreme fear. Winter for Hitler's Germany also means hunger and cold. The fascists will suffer even more severe blows. All mankind has risen up against Hitler. The resilient and enduring Russian army has no fear of severe frost, strong winds, and heavy snow. But Hitler's army is more likely to repeat Napoleon's mistakes, facing its end in the Russian snowfields."

### Key British and American Raw Materials Already En Route to the Soviet Union, Harriman Speaks in England, Discussing the Two Countries' Determination to Aid the Soviet Union in Resisting Germany

United Press, London, 17th: There is great confidence here that the Soviet war effort can be sustained beyond the winter. Therefore, reliable reports indicate that Britain and the United States have agreed to provide supplies to aid the Soviet Union, and they have agreed to the principle that Britain and the United States will each contribute half. United Press has learned from senior officials that Britain has shipped half of its possible inventory of key war materials to the Soviet Union. It is also said that some of these items have already arrived at Soviet ports. Officials expect that this shipment will further expand its transportation operations through Iran. More noteworthy is that Mr. Harriman, the leader of the American mission to the Soviet Union, said yesterday that British and American aid to the Soviet Union is already en route. He said, "I know that the British government has resolved to aid the Soviet Union to the fullest extent possible, and the American government has the same determination. I know that the British people are more concerned about the war and have a greater understanding than the American people of the importance of the Soviet Union in eliminating Hitler. But the current self-criticism in the United States is a prelude to greater efforts. I believe that the American people will further increase their efforts based on the current principles to make it happen." Harriman said that American aid to the Soviet Union includes technicians, machinery, and raw materials to maintain the American war effort, some of which have already arrived there. He said that the Soviet Union's transportation problems are quite difficult but not insurmountable.

Reuters, New York, 17th: The New York Times Washington dispatch says that serious consideration is being given here to the suggestion of requesting Congress to approve lending hundreds of millions of dollars to the Soviet Union to purchase arms. According to official announcements, the Soviet Union has not requested financial assistance. According to information obtained by the New York Times, President Roosevelt's future lend-lease proposal to Congress will not include the aforementioned request, for fear that opposition from anti-communist elements in Congress will further delay the appropriation of lend-lease funds.

### Cairo Bombed for the First Time, Egypt Protests to Germany, British Aircraft Attack Targets in Germany

Reuters, Cairo, 17th: The Egyptian government has protested to Germany and Italy regarding the bombing of the Kaiwi area on Tuesday morning. International News Service, Cairo, 17th: Axis bombers bombed Cairo for the first time yesterday, killing 39 civilians and injuring many others. This bombing has raised the issue of British retaliation against Rome, as both Cairo and Rome possess a large number of antiquities but have so far not suffered the misfortune of being bombed by the enemy. When Greece was invaded by German forces, Britain warned Italy that if Athens was bombed, Britain would retaliate against Rome. Upon hearing of the attack on Cairo, London newspapers unanimously demanded retaliatory air strikes against Rome.

Reuters, London, 17th: German long-range guns, silent for eight days, opened fire last night at 8:00 PM, firing across the English Channel towards England. The visibility was clear at the time, and coastal observers saw muzzle flashes from German guns firing from Cap Gris-Nez on the opposite shore.

Reuters, London, 17th: Official reports say that the British side destroyed six enemy fighters yesterday.

Reuters, London, 17th: The Air Ministry announced that British bombers attacked targets in Karlsruhe and other places in western Germany last night. Fires broke out in many places, and the Hamburg shipyards were also bombed. All British aircraft returned safely.

### Allied League Under Organization

Reuters, London, 17th: "The Allied League" is currently being organized to assist in the formation of a new Europe. Officials say this is the London International Conference organized under the guidance of the International Committee of the League of Nations Association. The president is Viscount Cecil, and the honorary vice presidents include Simopoulos (Greek Minister to London), Cassin (Free France), Masaryk (Czech Foreign Minister), and Zaleski (Poland). The association is currently inviting the following countries to be member states: Australia, Belgium, China, Czechoslovakia, Free France, Britain, Greece, the Netherlands, India, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Africa, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia.

### British and Soviet Troops Will Jointly Enter the Capital of Iran, Abdicated Iranian King Has Left the Capital for Elsewhere, New King Sworn In Yesterday Afternoon

Reuters, Tehran, 17th: It is believed that British and Soviet troops may jointly enter Tehran today. The Iranian Parliament is scheduled to hold a special meeting this morning, at which an announcement regarding the Iranian King is expected.

Reuters, London, 17th: Equal numbers of British and Soviet troops have advanced to within miles of Tehran. It is heard that the purpose of this move has no direct relationship with the abdication of the Iranian King, but is related to the Allied determination to clarify the situation of Germans in Iran. These Germans will all be expelled from Iran in order to eliminate the Axis powers' schemes. Although the Iranian government has good intentions in this regard, it cannot effectively deal with it alone.

Reuters, Tehran, 17th: The abdicated Iranian King left the capital yesterday, traveling along the road to Isfahan. British troops are also advancing towards Tehran along this road. According to a radio broadcast, the National Assembly, in a temporary session yesterday, declared that the policies of the Iranian government in the past twenty years were the sole responsibility of the deposed King of Iran, because he was the absolute ruler. A declaration regarding the new government has also been issued, stating that the new government will be based on constitutional procedures, and the new King is scheduled to be sworn in this afternoon.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 17th: According to news obtained from Berlin yesterday afternoon, the German expatriates in Iran who have been granted permission to leave the country are women, children, and embassy staff, who are scheduled to depart on Wednesday. However, the spokesman did not specify whether the departure of embassy staff meant the severance of diplomatic relations between Germany and Iran.

### Random Notes on the European War (81): The Tactics of Blitzkrieg: Offense and Defense

Hitler launched an invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22 of this year, originally intending to occupy the three major cities of Leningrad, Kiev, and Moscow in two months, and advance all the way to the Ural Mountains. It is now the second half of September, and this military plan has proven to be a failure. This is a major setback for the German blitzkrieg, and the offensive and defensive tactics of this kind of warfare are therefore of great research value. Here is a translation of an article by British military scientist Tom Wintringham published in the London "Picture Post," with five accompanying diagrams taken from the publication of the US Military Academy.

The German new-style offensive tactic, known as Blitzkrieg, aims to break through and destroy a certain line of defense. This kind of defense line has many layers, which are guarded by a network of fire. Historically, the entire defensive strategy of military science has been based on resistance with firepower, that is, using machine guns to form a wall of fire to prevent enemy infantry from passing through, and using anti-tank guns and artillery to form many walls of fire to prevent enemy tanks from passing through. As for modern German tactics, they are based on both firepower and movement, that is, concentrating mobile troops to attack a narrow portion of the enemy's defense line, passing through those walls of fire, and then expanding in the open area behind the walls of fire.

French military theory has also emphasized a longer-range defense, that is, using firepower to prevent the enemy from approaching. The German theory of concentrated attack and rapid action is a short-range strategy. Since the last European war, the German side has produced an endless stream of short-range weapons, such as mortars, automatic rifles, and hand grenades, for this reason.

German offensive tactics are based on breaking through a single point. Their attacking troops do not make a flat, frontal attack along a wide line of battle, but pierce through certain weaknesses of the enemy with a narrow front, like a spearhead, and increase this attacking force by using rapid movement.

They can suddenly concentrate a large number of troops on a narrow position and advance at a rate of fifteen to thirty miles per day after breaking through the enemy's defense line, which is largely due to motorized units. Their troops are not all motorized; most of them are ordinary infantry, who still advance on foot or are transported by rail. But they have sufficient motorized infantry, advancing alongside tanks or closely following tanks, and are part of the armored division (each armored division has 48 heavy tanks, 84 medium tanks, 252 light tanks, 230 troop carriers, 96 artillery pieces, 27 dive bombers, 258 armed motorized bicycles, and 1,000 other military vehicles, four battalions of motorized infantry, engineers, and signal corps), and after breaking through the defense line, they quickly expand, crossing the enemy's empty rear. The concentrated striking power of this motorized unit is five times more agile than in the last European war, and after passing through the enemy's defense line, it can advance and expand the victory five times faster.

Using aircraft instead of artillery is the second key point of German tactics; utilizing large numbers of tanks is the third key point. They use aircraft to bomb, isolating the battlefield they have chosen, eliminating the defending artillery, and dropping blocking bombs in front of the tank vanguard that breaks through the enemy's defense line. These tanks are not used to eliminate or block the enemy's machine guns, anti-tank guns, and field guns, as stipulated by previous military science, that is, so-called "weapons of annihilation." They have actually become "units of movement," and their range of activity is not limited to the battlefield, but are the pioneers of the motorized infantry, and the road-paving units for heavy and medium-sized artillery mounted on gun carriages or rails, so that these artillery units can move in step with the infantry.

The German artillery is scattered, unlike the hundreds of guns in a row in the last European war. Concentrated artillery only clogs the roads and is an easy target for aircraft bombing. They now have many small-scale artillery units, distributed among various infantry regiments, tank regiments, and motorized units. Aircraft share part of the work of artillery, but not all. They only carry out bombing in places where artillery cannot reach, attacking not only the defense line but also the transportation lines and reserves in the rear. In addition, aircraft also take on tasks that artillery cannot quickly accomplish, which is simply because the advance and retreat of artillery cannot be as flexible as tanks. But artillery must still take on the task of destroying various types of sustained resistance from the enemy and must quickly advance alongside or closely follow the attacking troops.

In terms of the use of tanks, the German army has completely overturned the original military theories. According to the original military theories, tanks should cover infantry advancing at a rate of three miles per hour. The German army, however, assists tanks with motorized infantry at a rate of ten miles per hour when necessary. When tanks encounter obstacles that cannot be quickly crossed, such as canals, large rivers, or tank defense trenches, they call up the following motorized infantry and engineers to find ways to cross these rivers, build bridges over the defense trenches, or blow them up. At the same time, it also calls up the dive bombers in the army to concentrate on clearing the defending troops within half a mile of this obstacle. (To be continued)

### Finance Black Market Black Market: Still Room for Activity, Talk of Using US Dollars Instead of Foreign Exchange Remains Rampant

To this day, the black market exchange rate has become increasingly elusive and difficult to discern. On the one hand, there's an official stance suggesting the black market has been completely eradicated. On the other, whispers persist in the market, implying that both small-time and larger traders engage in covert exchange practices, each with their own subtle methods. If this is true, it raises suspicions. Apparently, some don't want to outwardly defy regulations for fear of fines, but they're also unwilling to relinquish the substantial profits. Instead, they might as well engage in open and above-board black market trading. While it's generally hoped that US dollars can replace foreign exchange, the market seems to believe it's already a reality. It's said that certain small trading firms are involved, enabling goods to be shipped from Hong Kong. Otherwise, who would have the audacity to chase after US dollars like flies after carrion? Yesterday, the rate jumped another 6.5 jiao, reaching 22.6 yuan. Hoarding US dollars is considered as luxurious as storing jade in a cabinet, bringing smiles to everyone's faces. The rumor of foreign exchange being transferable between accounts, though denied by some, continues to circulate. However, obtaining proof is extremely difficult, much like how stocks, though officially non-transferable, can be privately exchanged with the consent of both buyer and seller and the agreement of an intermediary, by swapping seals. Furthermore, export goods are still being used for export bills. Whether this foreign exchange is settled with the bank at the official rate of 532 or sold on the market for 4.75 yuan, depends on which is more profitable. Naturally, everyone will choose the option that maximizes their profits. If there's no real control, activity will inevitably shift to the black market. Therefore, eliminating the black market will be extremely difficult, but not impossible. The problem is the lack of decisive action. Thus, yesterday, the officially listed exchange rates remained unchanged, and the HSBC exchange counter remained static. However, it's said that there was considerable settlement of sterling and US dollar transactions on the black market, facilitated by small money changers on Sichuan Road, with a rate of 4.75 yuan. However, Chinese merchants and speculators are still strictly prohibited from engaging in transactions with Chinese and foreign banks. How to settle these transactions, the Exchange Equalization Fund has not yet provided instructions. The rate of 4.6885 yuan was common for settling forward positions. The closing prices for the US dollar were 4.75 yuan and for the British pound was 2/84375, compared to the previous day, the US dollar rose by 0.0625, and the British pound was flat. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Hong Kong, 17th (Wednesday) Dispatch: This morning, the foreign exchange market opened unusually stable, with no significant fluctuations in any exchange rate. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Tianjin, 17th (Wednesday) Dispatch: This morning, the foreign exchange market opened flat. Telegraphic transfers for London and New York showed no fluctuations. Shanghai exchange rate fell by 1.5 yuan, to 88 yuan. The black market rate for "Joint Notes" slightly depreciated by 0.15 jiao, to 49.75 yuan.

### Still Heavily Buying, Gold Prices Rise Again, Reaching Above the 9,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the dark market was also active. Futures remained stable, with only a few hundred taels traded, with price only about five yuan high. In the end, there were no gains or losses compared to the previous late session. Spot prices continued to climb, breaking through the 9,000 yuan barrier. This was due to a certain bank secretly purchasing large amounts, agitating the hearts of everyone. The price opened fifty yuan higher from the early morning, initially with Xianghe, Jinde Cheng buying 20 taels, Xin Yuan 30 taels, and Yongcheng 10 taels.

### US Dollar Continues to Rise, Reaching 22.6 Yuan Yesterday

Yesterday's foreign currency market conditions saw sterling and US dollar prices rise by five yuan each in the spot market. Sterling notes were slightly in demand, with the market price rising by one yuan. Demand for US dollar notes was particularly strong, already reaching 22.6 yuan, an increase of 6.5 jiao compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes were slightly weak. Japanese and Korean notes were trending upward, with the former rising to 2.35 yuan and the latter rising to 1.92 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton In the midst of a decline in all goods, the yarn market is also seeing a lone tree difficult to support.

The yarn market is in a sluggish state, with a trend that appears firm but is not solid, and appears weak but is not truly soft. Large firms are still holding on, but the intentions of both bulls and bears are quite strong. Buyers, due to raw material factors, are still not releasing their absorbed amounts. As for sellers, they say that lately all goods have seen their peak and are tending to decline. Currently, the Hong Kong firms' demand is quiet, and the Nanyang firms have only a few transactions, only in 42-count and 40-count yarn, while 32-count yarn has no transactions. The yarn market is also seeing a lone tree difficult to support, so yarn prices are temporarily seen as loose. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,745 yuan, and the low price was 1,731 yuan. The initial opening in the afternoon was 1,738-39 yuan, weakening to 1,735 yuan. The closing price was 1,743 yuan. Currently, the yarn market is experiencing a weaker atmosphere at the exchange due to some deliveries. The market seems to be showing more weakness than strength, but the trend of Double Horse factory orders is improving. The future situation is unknown.

Double Horse opened in the morning, and the bulls' momentum continued to be strong. The first trade was high, at 1,745 yuan. However, retail investors took profits, fluctuating between 1,738 and 1,739 yuan. Then, it was heard that the exchange opened flat, and the current month was very soft. The second and third trades returned to weakness, and market sentiment loosened, causing the market to gradually decline to 1,731 yuan. However, large bullish firms did not relax and bought back in, rising again to 1,738 yuan at closing. A statistical calculation of the trade volume for half a day shows 6,575 bales traded. The amounts bought by various firms are listed below:

Nanyang 55, Hong Kong 20.

Counterparts 6.500, Total 6.575

Double Horse Futures Market Conditions, Solid but Slightly Soft, Market Conditions Turning to Consolidation. Although the international outlook has a bullish tendency, the continued decline of US cotton inevitably causes the bulls to be somewhat wary. Therefore, the market is circuitous, and buyers are temporarily waiting. However, the firm closing can already be seen as a solid foundation. If good news continues, and US cotton rebounds, then a rebound in the yarn market may see new highs again. At the opening of the morning, factory orders first rose, so the bulls' desire for futures yarn also seemed lively. September futures opened at 1,661 yuan, an immediate increase of four yuan. Later, as it lingered without moving forward, buyers became slightly less enthusiastic. Furthermore, the temporary intraday decline in the exchange caused slight fluctuations among the floating bulls, so it softened once again. October futures opened at 1,670 yuan, and November futures opened at 1,677 yuan. The noon closing showed that distant months fell by 3 to 4 yuan each except for near-term months which were better by half a yuan. In the afternoon, factory orders were higher, and the exchange was also more stable, so futures yarn followed the upstream, showing a prosperous sign. As a result, September futures closed at 1,659 yuan, up two yuan, October futures closed at 1,668.5 yuan, down 4.5 yuan, and November futures closed at 1,681.5 yuan, down slightly by 0.5 yuan. The list is shown below:

### US Cotton Declines Again, Coarse Cotton Alone Shows Improvement, 1,600 Bales of Indian Cotton

The current cotton situation is flatter than the previous day because foreign cotton has continued to trend downstream, but a portion of the market still tends towards a bullish outlook. Therefore, coarse cotton has shown improvement again, but the selling prices of 22-count and 32-count yarn are frequently decreasing. The price of 42-count Blue Phoenix has fallen by 300 yuan from its peak. Yesterday, no activity was heard from the factories, but the traders' activity in Indian cotton transfers was still relatively lively.

Indian cotton has arrived in Shanghai again. Taikoo Company's Guangdong Wheel brought 1,650 bales of Indian cotton from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf in Pudong to unload. The cotton was shipped from Bombay to Hong Kong and transshipped to Shanghai.

The New York cotton market continued to decline due to repeated hedging by the Southern firms and a lack of interest from professionals. Yesterday's closing prices were about 13 to 18 points lower than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to short covering and arbitrage buying, but then fell due to retail sales and weak transactions in cottonseed and cotton cloth. Finally, the market rose again due to short covering and speculative buying. As a result, closing prices rose by 1-2 rupees each. It is also predicted that the opening market conditions today will be bearish by 1.75 rupees.

Transactions in imported cotton in Shanghai are flat and lackluster. The impact of foreign exchange settlement issues and repeated delays in shipping continues, and order transactions are currently awaiting resolution.

### Foodstuffs Large Quantities of Foreign Rice About to Arrive, Rice Prices Rise and Fall Quickly

Foreign rice has arrived at the port again. In addition to carrying a large batch of sugar, Taikoo Company's Guangdong Wheel also carried 1,000 bags of sugar from Hong Kong. Jardine Matheson's Rising Sun arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying 1,166 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. It is said that a large quantity of Burmese and Vietnamese foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai within days.

Yesterday, foreign rice had actual sales and hoarding by local customers and merchants taking advantage of low prices in the morning and at noon. And the market is closed today, the practical sales were particularly strong, so after the opening, the spot rice prices opened with Saigon special goods at 116-117 yuan, small banks and stores with 103.2 yuan, 103 yuan, outside banks and stores 102.5 yuan, 102 yuan, broken rice also reached 77 yuan, and 80 yuan for Chonglu. However, the general practical sales still held a steady-minded approach, always watching, because of which the market atmosphere was less foundation, as soon as the price rose, the football trade declined again, and many took advantage of the situation to come out, and for a time the return of goods was flooded again. The situation was also unfavorable to the bulls, and the new rice market and the full reserves have made the new hoarding shrink back, and some rice firms have already collapsed due to price declines, owing more than 100,000, and the market sentiment is weak, and the market immediately turns from rising to falling, small stores have also fallen to the 100 yuan mark, and other rice have generally followed the fall of two or three yuan, while the small store of the Yinghua Company has fallen to 120 yuan, because the previous day was not set for the fall and was even weaker, and the spot rice has no access, the total day's transaction was 26,000 bags, and more than 100 tons, and in the afternoon there was no formal transaction in the market due to the discussion of arrears, and the market sentiment is still soft, it is said.

For Thick and Thin Geng and National Rice Market, thick rice is still short of goods and has no market, and although the early rice of Nanhang has arrived in small quantities, due to the sluggishness of foreign rice, the market sentiment is also weak, and the selling price has continued to fall by about one yuan, opening at 146.8 yuan, 146 yuan, and as for the new Geng of Paidong, there has been more and more new products recently, and at the same time, other goods have been weak and have consistently fallen by one yuan, opening at 150.05 yuan.

The glutinous rice had a pretty good taste yesterday, so it was also scarce, and the market price was able to stand alone and had no change, and the Hong Kong special white rice was continued to open at 126-127 yuan, the ordinary was 123-124 yuan, and the settlement was up to 120 yuan, the high-grade glutinous tea opened at 111-112 yuan, and the settlement was up to 110 yuan.

Notice Today is the 918 Memorial Day, and the market is closed for one day as usual, with no market.

### Flour Football Trade Dares Not Act Rashly

The flour market still lacks improvement, but due to the liveliness of actual sales, it is difficult to fall, and the market seems to have a difficult situation of rising and falling. However, the rice market has already tended to fall, and the foreign flour has been stored and arrived in large quantities. In addition to the continuous processing of actual sales, large and small hoarding households inside and outside the industry have not dared to try rashly, and even the speculative football gangs have no way to kick up, so the market is instead trending towards a neutral trend, opening at 31.6 yuan for Five Swallow, 31.8 yuan for Banana, 32.15 yuan to 32 yuan for Fortress, 30.03 yuan to 30.05 yuan for Golden Dragon West, and closing at 30.02 yuan. The closing price is similar to the market price, with only a fluctuation of one jiao, the storage of wheat is withered, and the factory prices are still standing at the original price.

Foreign flour is transshipped from Hong Kong, The large batch of foreign flour shipped by the American wheel has been noted in previous reports. It is now known that Jardine Matheson's Sun Rising ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying 7,180 bags of foreign flour from Hong Kong, which was docked at the Roosevelt Pier to unload.

### Oil Cake There is a saying that Lianyue Oil Will Be Transported to Shanghai - The Bulls Keep Returning

Yesterday, the spot cooking oil continued to be made fresh, and the futures market was still firm at the beginning, but suddenly there was a saying that Lian Oil will come to Shanghai, causing the people's hearts to suddenly soften, and many households quickly spit out, and the price was consistently sharp, and as a result, the rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil were all rolled back by six or seven yuan compared with the previous day, and it was calculated that more than 8,000 dans of Qing oil were sold and delivered in September, with an opening price of 163 yuan, a high of 165.5 yuan, a low of 157 yuan, and a closing price of 157.25 yuan. 5,000 barrels of Huarihua rapeseed oil were delivered in September, opening at 164 yuan, with a high of 165.5 yuan, a low of 156.5 yuan, and a closing price of 157 yuan. 164.5 yuan was the opening price of delivery in October, with a low of 156 yuan and a closing price of 156.5 yuan. 1,300 bags of beans will be transported to Singapore on the 18th.

### Securities Internal Debt Persists Bears Hope for a Quick Decision Bulls Benefit From Persistence

In the public debt dark market, Grade C once broke the two-yuan mark yesterday, and then rushed out of the two yuan, which shows that the debt market is easy to rise and difficult to fall, and the bulls and bears are fighting fiercely. The bears are trying their best to suppress the small market, while the bulls are bravely pulling up, and although the bulls suffer from interest, they are filled with floating capital and do not care. Although the bears do not have the burden of interest, they can only temporarily avoid their edge when the lottery is approaching, and the bears benefit from a quick decision, and the bulls benefit from delaying, and this kind of persistence is only performed when the situation has no changes, and if this continues, the bulls suffer from the interest, the bears suffer from the lottery, and for a group of active elements, they get the benefit of the fisherman, and environmental changes are the exception. Yesterday morning, Tiansheng, Tongkang, Tongshun, Dahua and Hengkang slightly bought in, Rund, Dazhong and Yitai slightly sold out, and although the market opened low, Grade C broke two yuan, opening at 1.8 yuan, and then gradually pulled up, still closing at two yuan and two jiao. In the afternoon, Xinfu and Dingkang bought in, Defu and Jiufeng bought out, and the market price was extremely stable. As a result, except for Grade D, which did not make any openings throughout the day, the rest saw each other's highs and lows by about one jiao. The transaction volume was about 1.5 million yuan. A simple list is listed below.

In stock trading, 1,500 shares of Chinese Merchants Electric were traded at a price of 11.75 yuan.

The public industry's stock market has regained its firm momentum, and buyers' interest seems to be concentrated on Yangzi, Yinglian Reclamation and other stocks, so the increase is the largest in these stocks, and the rest are also mediocre. Rubber stocks are more lively than before.

### Sugar Market Sugar Continues to Arrive More Than 14,000 Bags

Large quantities of sugar continue to arrive in Shanghai, which has been repeatedly noted in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Taikoo Company's Guangdong Wheel arrived at the port, carrying a large batch of 12,145 bags of sugar from Hong Kong, and Jardine Matheson's Rising Sun also arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, also carrying 1,850 bags of sugar from Hong Kong, with the Guangdong Wheel stopping at the Taikoo Wharf in Pudong to unload, and the Rising Sun docking at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload.

The first batch of new black dates from Jiyang and new red dates from Cangzhou have arrived in Shanghai, with a total of 200 packages, and they can be opened today.

### Hardware Bamboo Steel Bars The Market Is Firm and High

Although there is some activity from the construction firms on this street, the number of bamboo steel bar transactions is not large. Since hardware products were banned from export, the sales of bamboo steel bars have been hit, and the quotation is difficult to skyrocket, which is also affected. At present, the mentality of those who hold a small amount of this product in the same industry is extremely high, because overseas sources are not easy to open in the short term, and the industry quotation is still being supported. Yesterday, the standard three-call flower color was sold at 3,300 yuan per ton, and the five-minute to one-inch goods were also opened at 3,250 yuan, and the dark market was still quite firm and high. In addition, there are 200 pounds of American double-linked tinplate shouted for sale at 850 yuan, 200 pounds of old steel factory iron at 750 yuan per box, and American narrow strip iron at 200 pounds per box, and the same color above two inches is sold at 650 yuan.

### British Tram Stopped Yesterday All to be Fully Operational This Morning Ticket Seller and Western Constable Clash Over Minor Issue After Authorities Mediate, Misunderstanding Immediately Explained Route 1 and 2 Trolley Cars Resumed Operation Normally Yesterday Afternoon

The No. 393 Route 16 trackless trolley car belonging to the Shanghai Tram Company, a British company in the Public Concession, was traveling to the Sanyangjing Bridge on Jiangxi Road at 8:00 AM yesterday morning when a conflict occurred between the No. 40 ticket seller and the No. 57 Western Constable due to a misunderstanding during inspection. This led to a work stoppage by all ticket drivers in support. After the company's comprador, Hu Ziyu, mediated and advised the workers to return to work first and wait for the company to negotiate a resolution, the workers accepted the advice and returned to work first at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Routes 1 and 2 trolley cars resumed operation immediately. The details are as follows:

Ticket Dispute Western Constable Intervenes

At around 6:30 AM yesterday morning, the No. 393 Route 16 trackless trolley car was traveling south on Jiangxi Road toward the Jincheng Bank station on Fuzhou Road when the No. 226 ticket inspector boarded the car and found a passenger without a ticket. The inspector then inquired with the No. 40 ticket seller, Wang Huisheng, who then instructed the passenger to purchase a ticket for 1.5 jiao. However, the ticket seller believed that the passenger had boarded the car at Caojiadu and needed to purchase a ticket for 3.5 jiao, leading to a dispute between the two parties. However, the issue was quickly resolved peacefully. When the car arrived at Sanyangjing Bridge, the passenger and the ticket seller started arguing again. At that time, a Western Constable, No. 57, from the Central Police Station passed by and asked what was happening. Unexpectedly, the No. 40 ticket seller and the Western Constable started arguing and ended up fighting. The ticket seller was slightly injured and both were taken to the Central Police Station. Later, the foreman of the tram company, the British man, Mike, bailed the ticket seller out and sent him to the hospital for treatment. The workers, believing that the Western Constable should not have used violence, immediately went on strike.

Advise Workers to Return to Work First

After receiving the report, the authorities, in order to maintain public transportation and social order, immediately explained the misunderstanding to the two men, advised the workers to return to work first, and resume the operation of all tram routes. However, all the workers demanded that the Western Constable who caused the incident be severely punished, and that they be guaranteed that the same incident would not happen again in the future. They also agreed to accept the advice and immediately go to work, so at 10:00 AM they used cars full of ticket drivers to the Jing'an Temple car factory (No. 80 Hede Road) to resume work. When they arrived at the car factory, there was another misunderstanding and conflict with the patrol officers stationed at the car factory, and ten workers were detained in the police station, so the workers were unable to resume work and the workers who were preparing to resume work dispersed.

Ten Workers Arrested and Released Immediately

The tram company deeply regretted the suspension of all tram routes, and in order to restore public transportation, the comprador Hu Ziyu, the workers and the authorities carefully planned a reasonable solution and invited worker representatives Driver No. 209 and Ticket Seller No. 19 yesterday afternoon to persuade them to return to work first and resume the operation of the trams, promising to be responsible for negotiating with the police station, and promising to immediately ask the police station to release the arrested workers. By 1:00 PM, the arrested workers had been released by the police station, and the striking workers agreed to immediately return to work, but because most of the workers had already dispersed, they were unable to notify only a portion of the workers to enter the factory to resume work.

Trams on All Routes to Resume Operation This Morning

Starting at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Routes 1 and 2 trolley cars (from Jing'an Temple to the Bund on Edward Road) resumed operation, with a total of 26 cars operating. As for the remaining routes, such as Routes 3, 5, 6, 7, and trackless trolleys Routes 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, etc., all are expected to resume operation completely this morning. The injured No. 40 ticket seller has been discharged from the hospital after being bandaged. Yesterday afternoon, he reported the sudden incident to the company's office, and a misunderstanding storm has come to an end. The tramcars in the French Concession are allowed to resume entering the Public Concession starting this morning.

### Two Japanese Nationals Shot on Nanjing Road Last Night Each Hit in the Back with a Bullet, Injuries Serious Stray Bullet Wounds a Passerby, Assailant Flees

Two Japanese nationals, one named Kimura Toshiji, 40 years old, residing on North Sichuan Road, Hongkou, and the other named Suzuki Sosaku, 34 years old, residing at No. 22 Hengxiang Lane, Miller Road, were invited by friends to dine at the Xinya Restaurant on Nanjing Road last night. After finishing their meal at around 9:00 PM, the two Japanese nationals exited and strolled eastward along Nanjing Road. When they reached the entrance of Fei Wenyuan Silver Store, No. 342 Shandong Road, Nanjing Road, two men suddenly followed behind them and fired six shots at the two Japanese nationals, causing each of them to be hit in the back by one bullet. The bullets did not pass through, and the two men fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The shooters then fled without a trace. A stray bullet also wounded a passerby, Wang Changfa, 20 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 760 Beijing Road, who happened to be passing by and was shot in the left thigh. Upon hearing the news, the police immediately dispatched a large number of detectives and police officers in patrol cars to investigate, and urgently summoned ambulances to take the injured Japanese nationals to Fumin Hospital for treatment. Both men were seriously injured and in critical condition. Wang Changfa was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, detectives conducted a thorough search of pedestrians at the scene of the incident, but found nothing. It is said that both Japanese nationals run shops in the Hongkou area.

### Electricity Surcharge Increase Planned: All Parties Watching Closely; User Classification Changed from Three to Two: Disguised Price Increase May Impede Market Prosperity

The Shanghai Power Company, previously citing fuel shortages and uncertain deliveries, requested and was approved by the Public Works Bureau to implement restrictions on electricity users, limiting monthly electricity consumption to 70% of the highest consumption of the previous year.  Consumption exceeding this limit would be charged at six times the current rate. This measure was essentially a disguised price increase.  Last month, the company argued that the aforementioned six-times surcharge was not sufficiently effective in conserving electricity and that fuel supply was worsening. They requested an increase in the surcharge for excess electricity consumption, which was approved by the Public Works Bureau. On the 19th of last month, a new fee schedule was announced: consumption exceeding the allocated amount by 2% would be charged at six times the rate, from 2% to 10% at twenty times the rate, and above 10% at fifty times the rate. Any user consuming more than 1,000 kWh would also be charged according to the above rates. This was the second disguised price increase.  However, less than a month after implementation, according to a reporter of the Da Zhong News Agency, the Shanghai Power Company, citing rising coal prices, has decided to impose an additional surcharge starting on the 1st of next month. The original classifications of large, small, and general users will be reduced to two: industrial users and general users.  The additional surcharge for industrial users will be 11%, and for general users, 7%. A request has already been submitted to the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Bureau.  All parties believe that this move would increase the burden on citizens and affect market prosperity. Therefore, since this news spread, they have been urging the Public Works Bureau to pay close attention.

### Public Warehouse Funds Frozen: Over Six Thousand Pounds

It is reliably learned that the Shanghai Food Rice Public Warehouse Management Committee, in handling matters related to the purchase of foreign rice, the payments for goods and freight, according to the contract stipulations, required payment in British currency. The committee's foreign exchange funds, apart from the rice payments already made, the remaining funds reserved for freight charges that have been frozen, amount only to six thousand seven hundred seventy-two pounds and ten shillings held in the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, equivalent to approximately five hundred thousand seven thousand three hundred seventy-four yuan in national currency.  As for the British currency needed to pay for insurance and supplement insufficient freight costs, it has been approved after the committee's application.  In summary, the frozen British exchange funds of the committee amount to just over six thousand pounds, and not the seventeen million yuan as reported in yesterday's newspaper.

### Strike in the Photo-Engraving Industry: Still at a Standstill

Over two hundred workers in the photo-engraving industry in this city recently submitted ten items for amending the labor-management agreement to the employers. After several earnest discussions between representatives of both labor and management, a general agreement had been reached. Only the severance pay item remained, and a formal agreement was expected to be signed after brief negotiations. Unexpectedly, the labor side suddenly announced a strike starting on the 16th. For three days until now, the labor side has not sent representatives to contact all parties, so the situation remains at a standstill.

Concessions Intensify Alert Work

The police authorities of the two concessions, fearing that unscrupulous elements might engage in illegal activities on the 9/18 anniversary to disrupt the order of the concessions, after implementing preventive measures the day before yesterday, yesterday ordered all police and constables of the police department to step up operations and undertake security duties. The subordinate reserve teams, standby teams, security vehicles, mobile patrol teams, inspection teams, search teams, and plainclothes patrol teams each went to designated sections to search suspicious pedestrians and vehicles.

Promoting the V-sign Fundraising Campaign

All public entertainment venues such as Peking opera theaters, movie theaters, and amusement parks in the city have decided to voluntarily close for one day to express their condolences because all circles of the city have decided to suspend entertainment today. The student circles of Shanghai, in response to the V-sign movement, have launched a V-sign badge charity sale. The badge is printed on colored card stock, with a blue V-sign and the Chinese national flag embedded in the center, which is quite beautiful. The price is one dime each, with the aim of building confidence. The campaign starts today (the 18th) and is scheduled to end on October 10th, with a target of 10,000 badges.

Enthusiastic Morale in All Circles of the City

Today is the tenth anniversary of the September 18th Incident. Although all circles of the city cannot hold grand ceremonies due to the special environment, the morale is extremely high. It is reported that the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters and various groups such as academic circles and women's groups have issued proclamations to the public, encouraging all circles to strengthen their beliefs and complete the great task of resistance and construction.

### Surplus from the Sale of Foreign Flour at Fixed Prices: All to Be Used for Charitable Deeds; Totaling Over 50,000 Yuan

At the beginning of last year, the Public Works Bureau, considering that the high price of flour in the city was significantly affecting the people's livelihood, and in order to regulate the flour market, obtained the consent of the Fufeng and Fuxin flour mills to supply affordable flour from February 18, 1940. The two mills directly distributed the flour to various flour shops for resale to genuine users. At the end of November of the same year, the bureau sent a letter to the major foreign flour import firms in the city, requesting them to negotiate with their clients to extract one-tenth of the imported foreign flour to supplement the supply of affordable flour. The trading firms responded favorably and began to extract the flour from December 2 of the same year. Afterwards, the city's leading flour shops, Ruiji, Yuanfeng, Wanfeng, Zhengfeng, Tongshengchang, and Dinghouji, were entrusted to form the Shanghai Foreign Flour Fixed Price Sale Committee. Under the supervision of the bureau, the committee was specifically responsible for advancing funds and selling the foreign flour at fixed prices, which was highly effective.

Fixed-Price Sales Stopped

This year, since July 1, the Fuxin and Fufeng mills, due to a shortage of raw materials, had to stop selling flour at fixed prices, and the affairs of the Foreign Flour Fixed Price Sale Committee also ended. The complete statement of income and expenditure has been audited by Chinese and foreign accountants. The surplus totaled 57,999.26 yuan in legal tender. On the 11th of this month, the bureau convened a meeting of the original initiators and important flour merchants to discuss the matter.

### Shanghai Goods Passing Through Burma Require British Consular Visa to Prevent Re-Export of German Goods

The Ministry of Economic Affairs has approved the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' September 1941 telegram, which received a letter from the British Embassy stating that the Governor of Burma has decided that in the near future, all dyed textiles, dyed textile raw materials, dyes, and medicines coming from Shanghai must be accompanied by a certificate issued by the British Consul General in Shanghai or by an approved merchant. Otherwise, they will be prohibited from being imported into Burma. The above is to prevent Shanghai from re-exporting, transporting to Burma for sale or modification. The said prohibition also applies to goods passing through Burma into China. The Burmese government sincerely hopes to avoid delays in such transit trade, so it earnestly hopes that the certificates required for the above goods can be applied for as soon as possible.

Two weeks ago, someone had arranged to meet with Ivanov, but his wife had seen the threatening letters and knew that a car with five suspicious-looking Chinese people inside had been parked near their residence for a long time. Therefore, Ivanov did not go to the meeting. Last Thursday, Ivanov told Mr. Ji Qing, a member of the White Russian Committee, that he had repeatedly received threatening letters and intended to resign. The next day, Ivanov also discussed the matter with Mr. Grigoriv, chairman of the Russian Chamber of Commerce here, informing him of the danger to his life and that he intended to resign.

### Mourning Mr. Di Pingzi: Another Great Figure in the Newspaper Industry Has Passed Away

While the world is mourning the death of Mr. Zhang Jiluan, Mr. Di Pingzi, the former owner of the Shibao, has also passed away at this time. Today is the fifth seven-day memorial service for Mr. Di. Remembering this elder, one feels even more saddened.

In the spring of 1936, Mr. Di suddenly suffered a severe illness and narrowly escaped death. Although he recovered slightly, he could no longer move freely. In recent years, he has been devoted to Buddhism and enjoyed himself with painting and calligraphy. From August 1 of this year, he suddenly fell ill, and medical treatment was ineffective. He passed away at his residence in Shanghai on the 14th, and his remains were buried in Maqiao, Dachang. The gentleman's name was Chuqing, his courtesy name was Baoxian, his sobriquet was Pingzi, and his other name was the Master of the Pingdeng Pavilion. In his early years, he studied in Japan and strongly advocated reform after returning to China, facing many dangers as a result. Therefore, he was admired by Liang Rengong. In 1904, he founded Shibao and devoted himself to cultural undertakings, making great contributions. His most notable achievement was the short commentary in Shibao. The Shibao Memorial Album, printed in 1921, states: "This newspaper pioneered current affairs commentary, dividing sections for analysis, grasping its key points, and briefly following the example of Runan's monthly criticism." "The rise and fall of a country depends on education. From the beginning of its publication, it has been committed to this and has never slackened." These few points were indeed the characteristics of Shibao in those years and were praised by the people of the time. He also founded the Youzheng Bookstore, widely collecting fine books and using exquisite and fresh printing techniques to reward the cultural world. His most notable works include (1) Compilation of Han and Jin Western Frontier Wooden Slips, (2) Essence of Six Dynasties Statues, (3) Pingdeng Pavilion Collection of Jin and Tang Legal Rubbings, and (4) Mustard Seed Garden Painting Manual. Mr. Di's calligraphy was exquisite, following Yu Yongxing, and he once said, "The calligraphy of the Tang people, such as Yan, Liu, Ou, and Xue, is superior in its rectitude and solemnity, but only Yongxing is superior in its elegance. His structure takes dispersal, not integration; his brushwork takes lightness, not heaviness. I say that Yongxing was able to obtain the spirit of Wang Xizhi in this." This shows his unique skill in calligraphy. Pingdeng Pavilion's poems were impassioned and also fashionable for a time.

Many figures from all walks of life mourned Mr. Di's death and sent condolence messages. Shen Enfu, a 78-year-old man, wrote the following couplet:

"A lover of antiquity and a collector of treasures, his calligraphy and paintings are passed down, and everyone praises the Pingdeng Pavilion. A senior figure who promoted reform, one sighs at the vicissitudes of life, and one will see the year of revival in the netherworld." Chen Shi wrote in mourning: "For forty years we have known each other in Shanghai, our friendship in this time, together we have grown old, together we remember poetry and wine. Reaching an old age to save the country, floating in the clouds returning to paradise, a good son still far away, making offering with a silent cry.

### Paramount Athletic Association Launches Charity Basketball Tournament, Invites Lanbai and Huxing Teams to Participate in Competition, All Proceeds Donated to Student Loans

Mr. Gu Liancheng, the president of the Paramount Athletic Association in this city, is usually eager for public good, and enjoys doing good deeds. The Paramount basketball team under his leadership has served countless charitable and public welfare causes. It is learned that the Paramount is about to end handicap basketball. It would be a pity to leave the prepared ground unused. Mr. Gu also noted that the student loans established by the Shen Bao and Xin Wen Bao, two major newspapers in this city, are very successful.

And the Nanton Children's Education and Welfare Center of this city is preparing to establish a college savings fund. Therefore, it was decided to organize a charity basketball tournament, inviting the Lanbai and Huxing teams, the elite of Shanghai basketball, to hold a competition with the Paramount team respectively. Each will play a best-of-three series. Two championships will be set up. However, Lanbai and Huxing will not play each other, because the players on both sides are mostly the same. They are strong together but tend to be scattered when separated. The same goes for Quanhei and Qianghua. Therefore, Quanhei was not invited to join. In the future, the ticket revenue will be divided equally into two parts and donated to the Shen Bao scholarship, the Xin Wen Bao student loan, and the Nantong Children's Education and Welfare Center's college savings fund. No expenses will be deducted. All preparation costs and all expenses will be paid by the Paramount Athletic Association. To demonstrate credibility, in addition to sending the sold tickets to the above three institutions for stamping, the total number of tickets sold on the day will be revealed on the spot, and the ticket stubs will be photographed for verification. As for the opening date of the charity match, it is tentatively scheduled for

Next Wednesday

The organizers convened a first preparatory meeting last night with all parties concerned. Other details will be disclosed soon. It is reported that the Lanbai team is the champion team of this year's disaster relief charity competition, and Huxing defeated Qianghua in the summer competition. Currently, Qianghua will play against the two teams separately under the name of Paramount, which is even more eagerly awaited by fans. Therefore, when the war begins, the excitement, tension, and stimulation will be beyond imagination.

### Procrastination

— Xiao Yun

People are born and then they die. But the speed of death varies slightly. Some die suddenly from an illness, it comes unexpectedly; some people with chronic diseases, although their condition is critical, and life hangs by a thread, can still be prolonged for a considerable period of time, but the result is still inevitable death. Therefore, some family members of patients, seeing the patient "prolonging" the suffering, especially those suffering from painful ailments, often prefer the patient to die sooner. This kind of wish is not a cruel expression, but a humanitarian starting point. Because during the "prolonging" period, life has already lost its meaning.

Some people also have the habit of "procrastinating" in doing things, especially when encountering difficult problems, they procrastinate again and again, until the matter is imminent and they have no choice but to deal with it. This bad habit is enough to show that the authorities dare not face reality, and procrastination is only a temporary means of evading and dealing with problems.

The US-Japan negotiations, which have been attracting attention from all parties in recent days, no matter how cleverly the authorities promote them, we may as well regard them as a kind of "procrastination." The contradictions between the United States and Japan are obvious facts, which cannot be concealed by the cries of "understanding." The complex problems of the Pacific relations cannot be completely resolved by bilateral negotiations between the two countries. In this turbulent world, we certainly do not want to see people meet with weapons again, causing more people to suffer greater pain. But hoping that this delaying negotiation can maintain peace in the Pacific for a long time is nothing more than a wishful thinking that makes people happy for a while.

### Should We Practice Birth Control?

— Fille

Should we practice birth control?

At this time and in this place, to answer this question, it seems necessary to add some considerations. But a person who touches reality will tell you very frankly:

"The clearest answer is to remove the '?' and replace it with a present tense '!'!"

I agree with this statement.

Mrs. Sanger, Ms. Stopes, etc., sowed the seeds of this happiness—birth control—allowing Europeans and Americans to see the true meaning in terms of "sex." At least, their understanding of the comparative study of "quantity" and "quality" has been extended to the eugenics of the human race.

I heard an American friend talk about the promotion of "birth control":

"Don't think that Ruth is a head taller than you and several times stronger than you just because she drinks a lot of milk and exercises a lot. You should know that she is just the older sister of 'one younger sister'; you are the younger sister of 'nine older brothers'!"

This concept of valuing "quality" is the opposite of our country's "many children and grandchildren." Therefore, the birth control movement in our country has stagnated in the previous century. The revolution of traditional ideas is the most difficult thing. If ideas are deeply ingrained, happiness will run away. Our country's losses in the way are not just this one!

Strictly speaking, none of the products of unrestricted fertility meet the standards. You can see the shortcomings in your own or your brothers' health. This shortcoming makes the entire nation tend towards "weakness."

I admit that a mother should exert the greatness of her motherhood, but she is not completely a production machine! Does she give all of her time and energy to a group of children? Or does she have other missions? That long sigh of theirs is the most terrifying sound in the universe.

Furthermore, the father: if he has to worry about Lili's tuition, Linlin's leather shoes, Xixi's biscuits, Beibei's milk powder, and his wife's big belly, do you think his mind can still accommodate the landlord's face and the manager's airs? Not to mention that he has the energy to develop his career and future!

Then, if I am a tenth younger sister, I insist on carrying a schoolbag and going to kindergarten, just like Xiao Qi next door, Mom will look at me with a complicated face:

"Child, how can Mom not know that your blessings have been taken away by your older brothers and sisters; conversely, theirs have also been taken away by you..."

Economy, family, society, tells you that you will lose "nurture" and "teach"!

Birth control does not violate the needs of the current stage of the country. The quantity and quality of the army are not just mechanical, but also soldiers; machinery emphasizes both quantity and quality, while soldiers, quality is more important than quantity.

"Hot blood needs a steel-like body to match it—the same is true on the battlefield, and even more so for replenishment! Tomorrow's soldiers will not have a 'skinny good guy'!"

If our vision is correct, promoting birth control after the war is even more necessary, just as Mrs. Sanger advocated after the last European war.

Practically speaking, birth control and encouraging childbirth are not contradictory, but rather logically compatible. People who shirk the responsibility of childbirth and pursue hedonistic ideas should bear the obligation of childbirth! At the same time, we must liberate those who are in the depths of misery with "many children and grandchildren"! Therefore, promoting birth control is more focused on the working class.

Those who do not give birth will have a higher quality of life, those who give birth to many children will have better eugenics. The ultimate goal of birth control is nothing more than this!

Historical Tales

### Abdication

— Zhu Yu

Ai Zi's New Interpretation, Part Four

Ai Zi is a "story warehouse," and now he is going to tell us a story again.

Tang Yao inherited the imperial throne from his father, Emperor Yu, and governed the country very vigorously: establishing official systems, setting up patrols, and holding audiences with the princes, he was truly an ideal emperor. He was emperor for a total of one hundred years, but when he reached seventy years old, he felt that he was old and could not handle affairs properly, so he had the intention of retiring.

He first thought of his son Dan Zhu. Dan Zhu's learning was not bad, but he had a travel bug. How could someone who likes to travel govern a country?

There was no way. Yao said in court,

"I am old. Please recommend some virtuous people to be king, because the country is not a personal possession after all."

So everyone went to look for people, and as a result, they found two: one was Xu You, who lived in seclusion in Peize, and the other was Yao Chonghua (later Yu Shun), a filial farmer. First, he met Xu You, because hermits must have extraordinary talents.

Xu You entered the "palace." Seeing that the earthen steps were only three feet high, the roof was covered with messy straw, and the acorns were originally the natural trunks of trees, he thought, "Even a small inn should be prettier!" After the meeting, the "banquet" came: mud bowls, stone drinking vessels, yellowed brown rice, and quinoa soup.

"Virtuous man Xu, I want to give you the throne." Yao made a "please" gesture and said.

"Good emperor, who can stand being an emperor like this?" With a flick of his sleeve, our hermit bid farewell.

Those who dream of becoming high officials dream of wealth: "Traveling a thousand miles to become an official is only for money." Now many young people do not want to do great things, but want to become high officials. After reading this story, they will be speechless with laughter.

### Natural Result

Editor: In your magazine's "Essence of Submissions" on August 27, there is an article by Mr. Hua Fen, which mentions "Why men are always taller than women." He believes that men enjoy more advantages than women in the feudal system, so height is entirely created by the male-centered system.

I cannot agree with this point. I believe this is a natural result. Because if we look at the animal kingdom, the male is generally more majestic and taller than the female. The reason for this is that the female has the responsibility of giving birth and raising young animals, and the remaining duties of finding food and defending must be left to the male. Only a strong physique can be competent for finding food and defending. This is the reason for the greater height of male animals. So I believe that this is not due to the serious social system. I do not believe that there is any male-centered system in the animal kingdom. These are my humble opinions, and I would like to borrow a corner of your magazine to publish them for discussion.

Military Affairs

### The Eyes of the Modern Army

— Ke Zhong

In this European War, there were few significant changes in tactics and weapons, but some military equipment remained the same as before. During the First European War, the army relied on sausage-shaped balloons as its eyes. Today, the armies of various countries still use these sausage-shaped balloons to probe enemy movements. Under the balloon, there is a basket seat that can accommodate two scouts. After the balloon rises into the air, the scouts can look far and wide to observe the enemy's situation, and then transmit the information to the army. The army's movements are decided based on this report. This kind of reconnaissance balloon can be said to be the eyes of the modern army.

Twelve Unexpected Turmoil

Yu Kun did not agree with his words.

"Don't be so namby-pamby! Old San, you haven't been acting for more than ten years, why do you still have this energy?" He stopped, seemingly annoyed, and said, "As long as you are willing to listen to me, I'll take care of your daughter's affairs!"

At this time of sorrow and anxiety, a good friend who had grown up together since childhood suddenly came, and Qiu Haitang naturally regarded him as a savior sent from heaven. Especially this person, Yu Kun, is different from others. Just the entire set of theatrical costumes for Mei Bao's birth was entirely arranged by him alone. His wit and bravery can almost be said to be as uncommon among ordinary people as his love of drinking. Just thinking of past events, Qiu Haitang couldn't help but trust him.

Later, that Doctor Jiao was invited by Zhang Laoliu. He had treated Qiu Haitang for his previous illness, and his medical skills were quite good, so he prescribed a prescription that was both soothing and slightly tonic. (124)

### Queen's Theatre, New Building Worth Three Million Gold, Soon to Be Completed

— Qiu Sheng

Constructing a Pagoda - Magnificent and Beautiful - 2000 Seats - Elegant and Comfortable

The "Queen's Theatre" that movie fans are eagerly awaiting is already under construction day and night. The Queen's is located at the corner of Yu Qiaqing Road and Hankou Road, facing the racecourse. Its location is the entertainment center of Shanghai, so many people pass by there every day and care about it. The reporter specially visited Mr. Zhang Songtao, the owner of the theater, yesterday, and he kindly told me the details of the theater's construction as follows:

"The preparation for the Queen's began a year ago. At that time, many wealthy businessmen were paying attention to the open space next to Yipinxiang. Because the Guanghua Film Company has been doing well since its establishment, I am even more interested in the film business. I think: film is an enterprise and cannot be compared with general consumer entertainment, so I invited friends and obtained that open space at the highest price.

"But prices are soaring every day, so from the start to now, all materials have exceeded the budget by more than five times. This is something that I never expected. In the past, a first-class theater with a capital of 100,000 or 200,000 may have been enough; but now, it cannot be done without more than one million. And the capital we have invested is exactly two million, because we believe that if it is not so generous, everything will inevitably be simple and crude in the future.

"The entire equipment of the Queen's was designed by a famous foreign theater architect, who is also a famous architect in Shanghai. According to his opinion, the front will face the vast racecourse, but a very spectacular pagoda will be built at the corner of Hankou Road. This pagoda will be very beautiful and magnificent in the evening when viewed from the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road." According to Mr. Zhang, "The entire theater has a total of 2,000 seats, 1,200 seats downstairs and 800 seats upstairs. There is a very comfortable distance between the seats, which is the most important point. As for the screen and projectors, they are all identified and installed by experts."

Then when will it open? He said it would be in two months. In any case, it should meet with the people of Shanghai before Christmas. Now, staff are assigned to monitor the construction site every day, and even work at night.

It is rumored that the Queen's will show domestic films, and some say it will show Western films. Unexpectedly, Mr. Zhang smiled after hearing this and said, "The film policy has been decided long ago, but please forgive me for not announcing it yet."

The positions have also been decided long ago. The position of general manager will of course belong to Mr. Zhang. Mr. Li Zuchun and Mr. Li Ying will serve as general manager and deputy general manager respectively. Mr. Wu Chengda will be the director of the advertising department. They all have extensive experience in the film business.

### After Watching "The Beginning of Man"

— Jifeng

Since the Cloud Sea Theater Company performed "Floating Clouds" this spring, they have not met the audience for almost a full year. This time they performed "The Beginning of Man" at the Xuan Palace, just as they said themselves: "We have done our best."

The reason why the script of "The Beginning of Man" has been enthusiastically adopted is that the presenters at least hold the great mission of reforming society and educating the public. True: society is full of typical figures like Zhang Bonan, the bookstore owner's pair of high glasses, the tram ticket seller's shouts, the public place hostess's half-young lady tone, and the awkward appearance of the fourth-class bureaucratic style. They are all portrayed vividly here. It not only reflects the shortcomings of the times, and exposes its dark side as much as possible, but also points out the importance of adapting to the environment, and that the responsibility of reforming society lies on the shoulders of every people.

Speaking of the actors, it is undeniable that Situ Qi's Zhang Bonan is more remarkable. He has successively demonstrated three completely different postures: the poor scholar's distress and honesty in the countryside, the foolishness of a puppet obsessed with women, and the imperiousness of the comprador class. He handles them all single-handedly, steady and stable, and there is no flaw to be found. Xu Lin's principal is also performed well, but it is a little bit more low-level, but it is limited to the lines and cannot be changed. Hui Feng's Xiao Lilian's acting skills and words are both mature, but she lacks the grasp of the character's personality. To put it bluntly, she still lacks the expression of coquettishness and debauchery, which is the same problem as the "Humiliated Concubine" in Qing Palace Grudges. In addition, Yun Qing's Guo Jingting is also more satisfactory. In general: the performance of this play has spent a considerable cost, and at the same time it has received the same value effect.

### September 18th Commemoration: Entertainment Venues Closed

— Xing

Today is the September 18th Commemoration Day. All Chinese film theaters and Peking opera theaters will be closed for one day to show that they will not forget. Foreign businesses such as Da Guangming and Nanjing will also be closed.

Film People Sketches

### (23) Charlie Chaplin

The name Charlie Chaplin is really too common in the minds of the general public in our country. As long as you see a cane, a mustache, a dilapidated top hat, and figure-eight boots in the picture, you will think of Charlie Chaplin. He grew up in a family with artistic heredity in London, England, so his success is partly due to the influence of his family environment. Born on April 16, 1889. In 1910, he came to the United States to be the main character in a comedy. Later, he made a deeper impression on people for playing a drunkard, so he was able to sign a one-year contract with Keystone Films. Later, he founded United Artists with Xiao Fanbenke and Mary Pickford. He has divorced twice. Since filming "Modern Times", Bao Lian Gao Dai has become his angel and "Mrs. Zhuo" in order to find a female lead. Undoubtedly, he is a world-renowned superstar, and no one can hope to catch up with his great achievements.

Chapter 16: Early Escape of the Delicate Bird from the Cage

Now that Wu Sangui has spoken, if I don't agree, not only will he lose face, but I'll also create a grudge. When a major upheaval occurs in the future, not only will he refuse to protect my family, but he may even hate me and take the opportunity to harm me. Alas! This is truly a difficult problem! However, time absolutely does not allow him to hesitate. He glanced at Yuan Yuan, and stutteringly replied: "Does the General favor this little girl? Um... um!... I think..." Wu Sangui said, "I know my request is presumptuous, but can the Father-in-law forgive my recklessness and grant my request? I believe a gentleman helps others achieve their desires, and the Father-in-law will surely grant my wish." Tian Hongyu, being forced into a corner, had no choice but to say: "Since the General cherishes Yuan Yuan, I shall fulfill your desire and reluctantly give her away. But..." Before Tian Hongyu could finish speaking, Wu Sangui had already gulped down the cup of wine he was holding, clapping his hands and laughing: "Thank you, Father-in-law, for your great virtue, which allows lovers to be together. I am extremely happy today!" He then reached out and tugged at Yuan Yuan's sleeve, saying, "Yuan Yuan, quickly thank the Father-in-law for his gracious agreement!" Yuan Yuan, reminded by his words, quickly stood up and bowed gracefully to Tian Hongyu, saying, "Thank you, sir, for your immense kindness." Yuan Yuan's bow was like a nail hammered in place, and Tian Hongyu could no longer go back on his word. He could only force a bitter smile and勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强
