### U.S.-Japan Talks Still Show No Progress: Hull Reaffirms Basic Principles, Sternly Condemns Reliance on Force and Aggression; International Disputes Should Seek Peaceful Resolution

Reuters, Washington, 4th: Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that after the U.S. submitted a note on November 26, explaining its Far Eastern policy to the Japanese special envoy Kurusu, no reply has yet been received from Japan. The overall resolution of the Pacific problem still hinges on Japan's acceptance of the non-aggression policy stipulated in the U.S. note. Hull pointed out that the eight months of talks between the U.S. and Japan were a period of "talks and disorder," the disorder being because the words and actions of the Japanese side were directly contrary to the principles under discussion.

United Press, Washington, 4th: Informed sources say that Secretary of State Hull sternly condemned Japan for establishing a military autocracy in the conquered countries of Asia, and for relying on its aggressive force to oppress the conquered people. This shows the U.S.'s stance on possible reconciliation with Japan: the U.S. still firmly adheres to its declared policies, and the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Vietnam and China is the most important prerequisite for peace in the Far East. It is also said that the U.S. insists that the number of Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam should be reduced to the number stipulated in the agreement reached between Tokyo and the Vichy government last spring. Vichy initially agreed to 6,000 Japanese troops, which was later increased to 25,000, but according to various reports, there are currently at least 100,000 Japanese troops in Vietnam. Hull's statement is widely regarded as an official expression of pessimism regarding the outcome of the recent tensions in the Pacific. The U.S. government is still awaiting a reply from Tokyo regarding President Roosevelt's inquiry into the purpose and intention of the Japanese troop concentration in Vietnam, as it considers the withdrawal of Japanese troops a prerequisite for the start of genuine negotiations. In his criticism of Japan, Hull said that all aspects of Japanese policy, such as political, social, economic, and moral, are based on force. Hull emphasized when making this statement that this is completely different from the U.S.'s view of resolving international disputes peacefully. Hull also said that during the negotiations, he repeatedly told the Japanese side that the U.S. believes that all people should be treated equally and that international behavior should be based on justice and morality. The Secretary of State also said that all aspects of the problem have been discussed by both countries, including some major and minor issues, but many inconsistencies were found. Therefore, all aspects of the recent situation should be based on a document delivered to Japan, in which the basic principles of the U.S. are stated. Hull said that the document was delivered to Japan last Wednesday.

United Press, Washington, 4th: Informed sources here say that if Japan wants to save its "peace" talks with the U.S., it must show evidence of abandoning aggression. The U.S. is no longer satisfied with mere promises, but must see facts that provide evidence of sincerity. President Roosevelt met today with Vice President Wallace, Speaker of the House Rayburn, House Majority Leader McCormack, Democrat McHale, Alabama Democratic Senator Hill, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom, and Georgia Democratic Senate Finance Committee Chairman George. The discussions primarily concerned diplomatic issues.

United Press, Bangkok, 4th: Ishii, the new Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Thailand, said that if the Washington talks fail, U.S.-Japan relations will become serious, but Ishii also does not believe that a breakdown in the talks will immediately lead to war. He said that if the talks break down, the U.S. and Japan may decide on their positions without taking action against each other.

U.S. No Longer Deceived by Empty Words; Japan Finds Itself in a Difficult Position Regarding Advance or Retreat

Reuters, Washington, 4th: The Far East remains a point of attention for Washington officials. Everyone is watching Japan's increasing troop strength in Vietnam and Britain's increasing troop strength in Malaya, and awaiting the delayed replies from the Japanese side. The fact that the Japanese side has not replied immediately shows that Japan understands its future as a major power in the world depends on the nature of its reply. If Japan complies, the Axis powers will lose a member, and Japan can befriend democratic countries. Otherwise, the ABCD powers are prepared to strike hard. Japan's decision is undoubtedly a matter of survival, but this predicament is of Japan's own making, and no one else can help. The U.S. is no longer deceived by Japan's empty words, but will decide on its response based on Japan's actions. U.S.-Japan relations have now deteriorated to a point where they cannot be swayed by empty words. One critic said that Kurusu's claim that Prime Minister Tojo's remarks last week were misinterpreted is worthless, because since Prime Minister Tojo took office, the hostile and provocative nature of Japan's actions cannot be concealed by any remarks made by Kurusu. Historian Sullivan, who has always been cautious about President Roosevelt's foreign policy, wrote that the U.S. has made it clear to Japan that it must stop the war against China, must not take any action against Thailand or the Dutch East Indies, and must not attempt to invade Siberia. If Japan chooses to do any of these three things, the U.S. will have sufficient reason to declare war on Japan. Japan is ambitious and wants to become a powerful country on its own, in which case Japan will become a permanent threat to the U.S. General newspaper commentary also says that Washington has no room for concession to Japan. The U.S. is not threatening Japan, nor is it breaking off the Washington talks with impatience, but it cannot make any concessions. The Baltimore Sun said that if Japan disregards the principles that constitute the U.S.'s firm stance, it will risk an inescapable danger. The U.S. has now given Japan the opportunity and reason to consider its future actions. This statement can represent general American public opinion. Another matter that makes the U.S. take action rather than just talk is the discovery of East Asian Nazi tactics. This can be seen from the statement issued by Vichy protesting to Tokyo about Japanese interference in Vietnamese civil administration, just half a month ago, that the situation in Vietnam has now returned to normal, and from the meeting of Nazi diplomats in Shanghai. The Washington Post commented on the Nazi meeting in Shanghai, saying that Captain Weidemann, the former German Consul in San Francisco, who previously wanted to arrange for Hitler to advance overseas in the U.S., is now gathering with his friends in China, trying to undermine China's fighting spirit.

Tojo Attends Privy Council Meeting, Details U.S.-Japan Talks

Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: At today's regular meeting of the Japanese Privy Council, Prime Minister Tojo detailed the recent diplomatic developments around Japan, as described by Japanese news agencies, and especially discussed the U.S.-Japan talks in Washington. At the same time, Japanese news agencies reported that responsible figures in Tokyo expressed frank regret over the remarks made by the U.S. Secretary of State yesterday regarding the U.S.-Japan talks, and believed that Hull's sudden announcement of the content of the Washington-Tokyo talks at this stage of the negotiations was extremely inappropriate. Hull's revealing the purpose of his note to the Japanese representative is incomprehensible and is enough to raise questions among the general public about whether the U.S. sincerely wants the talks to succeed. Furthermore, Hull's publication of the content of the talks will further darken the future of the talks. At the same time, according to these responsible figures, they are disappointed with the U.S.'s adherence to "outdated" doctrines that do not apply to the realities of the Far East, and believe that Hull's remarks further increase Japan's need to proceed with continued discussions with greater caution. Japanese news agencies also said that today's Tokyo evening newspapers are shocked and extremely pessimistic about the future of the Washington talks due to Hull's remarks. The headline of the Nichi Nichi Shimbun is "Hull Criticizes Japanese National Policy, Reveals U.S.'s Lack of Sincerity in U.S.-Japan Talks." The Asahi Shimbun's headline is "The U.S. Attempts to Shirk Responsibility."

### Thailand Holds Cabinet Meeting to Review Far Eastern Situation; Country May Be Subject to Surprise Attack; Thai-Vietnamese Economic Negotiations Continue

Reuters, Bangkok, 4th: The Thai cabinet held its weekly meeting yesterday, and all aspects of the Far Eastern situation were reviewed. Last night, a Thai official radio commentator said that Thailand is at a critical juncture, which clearly indicates the Thai government's deep anxiety about the current situation.

Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: According to an Asahi Shimbun correspondent in Bangkok, the Thai cabinet met yesterday to discuss Thai-Japanese economic relations and Thailand's position in the current international tense situation. The Thai government has decided to offer 700 million Thai baht to buy the British and American cigarette factories in Bangkok and the tobacco plantations in northern Thailand. It is widely regarded that the Thai government's move is quite significant.

Reuters, Hanoi, The highest degree of tension still exists. There are still many who believe that Vietnam can find a solution to the current difficulties and avoid war, but the possibility of a sudden change in Thailand is still the current danger. Although there have often been indications that the Japanese military command will take dangerous initiatives, qualified sources still say that the Japanese troops currently stationed in Vietnam are not sufficient to launch a large-scale offensive, but it is very possible to choose a weak point and launch a blitzkrieg against Thailand.

Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: A Japanese correspondent in Hanoi reports that Vietnam is gradually realizing that its economy must be combined with Japan's economy, because its trade with Britain, the U.S., and other countries has now completely stopped. The economic negotiations between Japanese Ambassador Yoshizawa and Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux are making progress, and it is expected that Vietnam will accept the Japanese proposal to produce rubber and other raw materials in Vietnam. Local officials from all over Vietnam will attend the Hanoi conference tomorrow, and it is now believed that they will support the Governor-General's policy of cooperation with Japan.

Saigon Radio Reports Japan Will No Longer Increase Troops

United Press, Vichy, 4th: Saigon Radio broadcast a report last night saying that Japan has guaranteed that it will no longer send troops to Vietnam, and that Japan will not use French territories as bases for invading Thailand or Burma. It also said that the guarantee was conveyed by the Japanese ambassador in Hanoi to Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux.

Havas Agency, Vichy, 3rd: A certain Japanese news agency issued a message on the 2nd of this month, saying that a French government spokesperson had stated that the future attitude of French Vietnam should be determined by the Pacific War. Government officials have now corrected this, briefly stating that the French government's current policy has been officially declared and explained by the government on the 1st of this month. The statement stated that France is determined to defend Vietnam against possible aggression from any party. This policy has not changed. As for what attitude France will take when Japan uses the troops stationed in Vietnam to attack Thailand, it is considered that there is no such possibility at all. Even the Prime Minister of Thailand himself declared on November 27 that the Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam have no intention of launching an attack on Thailand or Malaya. In short, even if this issue arises, it should be considered within the scope of French interests.

Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: Kuriyama of the Japanese Embassy in Hanoi arrived in Fukuoka yesterday. It is said that Vietnam is now taking a calm attitude towards the U.S.-Japan talks in Washington. Since Japanese Ambassador Yoshizawa arrived in Hanoi, the Vietnamese officials' understanding of Japan's position in Southeast Asia and the public's sentiment towards Japan have greatly improved.

East Asian Newspapers Continuously Publish Threats to Thailand and Vietnam

United Press, Tokyo, 4th: Japanese battleships last night and this morning denounced England and the United States for "taking aggressive labor in East Asia". At the same time, they denounced Thailand's attitude towards Japan, Vietnam's insincerity and non-cooperation. It was solemnly stated that if Thailand does not accept Japan's request for economic cooperation and joining the co-prosperity sphere, the situation surrounding Thailand will become increasingly tense. At the same time, the Thai Embassy declared that the rumor that Thailand is sending a military representative to consult with the British military commander in Malaya is "completely false." Since Mr. Kuriyama, the Chief Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Hanoi, returned due to important talks, newspaper commentaries involving Vietnam have increased daily. The newspapers stated that Mr. Kuriyama's talks with Japanese officials would include: 1. Vietnam is said to be gradually lacking sincerity towards Japan. 2. Vietnam is not strong enough to maintain order and law, as can be seen from the bombing of the U.S. Consulate in Saigon. 3. Since it is rumored that Britain is about to invade Thailand, just like the invasion of Iran, the threat to Vietnam is increasing. The newspapers stated that due to the seven factors mentioned above, Japan may have to provide additional assistance to Vietnam in order to maintain peace and security. "Yomiuri Shimbun" commentator Hosokawa said that although Japan has guaranteed the integrity of French rule in Vietnam, the French are showing their lack of sincerity and constantly obstructing the relationship between the Japanese and the Annamese. Therefore, Japan must adopt "a more active policy" because the construction of the "co-prosperity sphere" must be achieved by cooperating with the natives who have blood ties. "Nippon Hiroki Jibo" said, "The actions of England and the United States to show force in the Far East at this time are intended to give Japan a deep impression, but Japan has expressed that its strength and goals in the Far East will hardly be shaken." The newspapers also denounced that the mines laid by Britain near Singapore are floating mines, which is a violation of international law, and may damage Japanese ships like the recent floating mines of the Soviet Union. This morning's editorial of "Nippon Hiroki Jibo" predicted that the Allied forces will soon occupy Thailand. The newspaper recalled that Thailand and Japan signed a treaty in 1606, in which Thailand guaranteed neutrality to Japan and promised to exchange information with Japan. Therefore, Thailand should now notify Japan about "the tricks and conspiracies of third countries." The newspaper said that Japan "must protect" its economic rights obtained from the friendship treaty signed with Thailand in 1940.

### Tokyo Holds Economic Conference; Japanese Foreign Minister Delivers Opening Speech, Saying East Asian Situation Is Serious

Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: The East Asia Economic Conference opened here this morning, lasting for three days. More than 400 people attended, including senior government officials, financiers, and industrialists. Foreign Minister Togo delivered a short opening speech, briefly stating that England, the United States, and other countries have not understood the doctrines practiced by Japan in the Far East and have hindered Japan in building a new order in East Asia. The purpose of this move by Japan is to obtain lasting peace and prosperity for all parties. Recent international developments are becoming increasingly serious, and East Asia is currently facing an unprecedented crisis.

### U.S. Builds 343 New Ships

Reuters, Washington, 4th: According to a report announced yesterday by Secretary of the Navy Knox, the United States has built 343 warships as of December 1 in its effort to rush construction of a two-ocean navy. The report also said that the newly built cargo ship Sea Otter has completed its final trial run on Tuesday, the 3rd, and will soon enter service. Knox told reporters yesterday that Japan knows how to keep secrets, especially naval secrets. When asked about the comparison of the tonnage of Japanese ships and the strength of the U.S. fleet, Knox replied slowly, "I myself do not know. The Japanese are good at keeping secrets about this information." A high-ranking naval official interjected from the side, "Of course, we know a little." Knox smiled at this remark.

### Domei News Agency Predicts Major Change in Mid-Month

United Press, Tokyo, 4th: The date that Japan expects for the "worst major change" to the United States may become a reality. Today, the Domei News Agency has made its first indication. The scheduled date is mid-December. Domei News Agency said that the Central Cooperation Council of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association is scheduled to begin on December 8 for a period of five days. Once the worst major change occurs, it will be shortened to three days. This means that if the "worst major change" occurs, the time may be after December 11. The agency said that this meeting will spend a full day exploring wartime issues to discuss the emergency situation.

Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: Today's editorial in the Nichi Nichi Shimbun said that the actions recently taken by the ABCD countries to mobilize in the South Pacific are obviously orchestrated by the United States. If the United States truly wants peace in the Pacific, this move is incomprehensible. The Asahi Shimbun said, after carefully examining the report that Welles, under the order of President Roosevelt, invited Nomura and Kurusu to a meeting, it feels that President Roosevelt is now personally in charge of the U.S.-Japan talks. Therefore, there will soon be a quick decision. Japanese newspapers did not mention the nature of the questions asked by the U.S. President.

United Press, Tokyo, 4th: The "Dokutsu Shimbun" said that unless the United States changes its economic demands that disregard the real situation in the Far East, no matter what President Roosevelt wants to know from the seventh talks in Washington, it will be impossible to overcome the difficulties. The newspaper said, "We demand that the United States abandon its common position. We cannot continue to take a passive bystander attitude towards the war that England and the United States are about to launch in East Asia, nor are we shocked by the actions of the United States."

### U.S. Senator Thomas Says Japan Will Eventually Break Away from the Axis; China Believes Far Eastern Situation Is Easing

United Press, New York, 4th: Utah Democratic Senator Thomas said last night that Japan will eventually be willing to sever its ties with the Axis and cooperate with peaceful countries that have interests in the Pacific region. He declared, "Japan's ties are there, not elsewhere. Its ties with the Axis are unnatural and will eventually be destroyed. Its current natural interests in the central position... it is prepared to be welcomed by all countries, including China, and based on equality and peaceful efforts." He also said, "It will eventually come back." The veteran Democrat said that in his opinion, the interdependence of the Pacific countries leads New Zealand, Australia, and Canada to the "practical development of the principles of our country's and the American countries' consolidation treaty." Thomas finally said, "England and the United States are cooperating with the Netherlands, China, and the Soviet Union, so the Pacific has been surrounded by countries that hope for and plan for peaceful trade."

Havas Agency, Chongqing, 3rd: After it became clear that Japan had decided to continue talks with the U.S. with the aim of delaying time, it is generally believed here that the tension of the imminent outbreak of the Pacific War has greatly eased. The Ta Kung Pao said that Kurusu and Nomura's meeting with Hull again must have received instructions from Tokyo to delay the question of time. However, whether England and the United States are willing to listen to their delays and give them favorable time to choose the timing of the war is important.

Singapore Observes That Japan Has Begun to Take a Defensive Stance

Reuters, Singapore, 4th: According to the phenomenon, Japan has begun to take a defensive stance in the Far East. For example, most of the fighter planes and reconnaissance planes have recently been transferred to the Pacific Islands under administration, and defensive fortifications have been built in the Japanese military bases in Vietnam, with anti-aircraft guns installed. Japan has always accumulated materials in order to be able to go out for use as soon as an order is received, but now it must be emptied for some of it. However, Japan's use of this material for overseas defense cannot be regarded as abandoning its aggressive intentions. This may only be a natural precaution plan, but it is enough to see that Japan attaches great importance to the possibility of active resistance from the ABCD powers.

Reuters, Chongqing, 4th: All sectors of the Chinese community here welcome the arrival of the British fleet in Singapore. An editorial in the Ta Kung Pao said that the arrival of Prince of Wales in the Far East will greatly shock Tokyo. Britain has won an important victory in the current war of nerves.

Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: After 24 hours of silence on the arrival of the British fleet in Singapore, the Tokyo radio station suddenly commented on this matter in various languages last night. The general idea is that England cannot win out many ships from the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, so Japan does not need to panic. However, the appearance of panic cannot be concealed. Its commentators said that the arrival of the British Navy in the Far East must be closely watched, especially because the Gibraltar of the East will probably be used jointly by England and the United States. This is another reason why Japan should strengthen its iron will to pay the overall situation.

Reuters, Batavia, 4th: Although Dutch observers here believe that the British fleet that recently arrived in Singapore has given the navies of the Pacific ABCD powers an advantage, they still believe that there is no possibility of a peaceful resolution to the current crisis. The Dutch East Indies government's attitude of vigilance has not relaxed. Military circles here are now closely watching developments in Washington. A semi-official opinion is that Japan's reply to the U.S. President's question about the reason for stationing troops in Vietnam may not satisfy the U.S. President, because Japan's intention to increase its military strength in Vietnam exists, and all observers in the South Pacific are well aware of this.

### President's Message of Profound Significance; U.S. Lend-Lease Act Applies to Turkey; House Appropriations Committee Approves National Defense Supplementary Funds; Marshall Urges Passage of Philippine Army Budget

Reuters, Washington, 4th: Last night's official message stated that the President has announced that he believes that Turkey's defense is closely related, and has instructed that Turkey's needs be supplied as soon as possible. White House officials are unwilling to comment on this brief message. Observers said that the White House issued this message at a time when there is no war raging, but the European situation points out that Turkey is the most important route to the oilfields of the Near East. It is of profound significance to send Bullitt as its special envoy to the Near East to investigate the needs of the British army in the Near East, while announcing that the Lend-Lease Act applies to Turkey. It is not yet known what kind of supplies can be transported to Turkey. Whether Turkey has sought assistance and whether negotiations have taken place between the U.S. and Turkey, officials have not yet made a statement. According to authoritative sources, supplies under the Lend-Lease Act have long been transferred to Turkey through England, but each time items are transferred to Turkey through England, they must be approved by the President. It is said that the main items obtained by the Turkish army are howitzer vehicles. According to Washington sources, the future supplies to be provided by the United States will include artillery, tanks, and other equipment.

Reuters, Washington, 4th: After President Roosevelt announced that Turkey would be eligible for treatment under the Lend-Lease Act, well-informed sources here said that Turkey has almost made a guarantee to the United States that it will resist German aggression if it receives assistance.

Havas Agency, Washington, 4th: Political figures say that President Roosevelt's decision to assist Turkey under the Democratic Country Assistance Act is a sign of new developments in the Near East and another victory for American diplomacy. It is noted that the five countries that enjoy the rights of the Democratic Country Assistance Act are England, China, Greece, the Soviet Union, and Poland. Turkey is the sixth country.

Haitong Agency, Ankara, 4th: Members of the Turkish Parliament commented today on the sudden inclusion of Turkey in the Lend-Lease Act beneficiaries by the United States, saying that commercial reciprocity is the Turkish government's original national policy.

Haitong Agency, Berlin, 4th: Local newspapers reported today that the German Foreign Ministry has received a report stating that Turkey is also included in the beneficiaries under the U.S. Lend-Lease Act. It is incomprehensible why President Roosevelt chose to include Turkey in the beneficiaries at this time.

United Press, Washington, 4th: The House Appropriations Committee yesterday approved a massive new national defense supplementary fund of $8,243,000,000, including funds to rapidly expand the army to two million, and to establish the U.S. policy of consuming what is necessary to defeat the Axis countries. The bill includes a new lease fee of $1,556,000,000, and authorizes President Roosevelt to transfer another $500,000,000 worth of sea and land army war supplies into the lease program. Than the new bill is pending passage by the House of Representatives and the Senate, so the lease program will reach a huge number of $16,300,000,000.

United Press, Washington, 4th: Army Chief of Staff General Marshall recently told the House Appropriations Committee that if the government must disband the Philippine army, it will become an explosion of sparks in the entire Far East, and testified for the appropriation of $269,000,000 to help the Philippine army. He said that if this case is not passed, the Philippine army will be affected and will be fully demobilized.

### US Lend-Lease Aid to China Has Reached Extremely Large Proportions: 14,000 US Trucks to Soon Run on the Burma Road; Any Parts for Military Aircraft Made in the US to be Immediately Shipped to Chongqing

Washington - According to government officials, the aid provided by the United States to China under the Lend-Lease Act has reached an extremely large proportion. About 14,000 trucks made in the United States will soon be running on the Burma Road. Another example is a temporary aircraft factory, with its parts manufactured in the United States and then shipped to a factory site in the Chongqing area. The equipment in this factory is for manufacturing any parts needed for any type of US military aircraft (from medium bombers to fighters and reconnaissance aircraft). Currently, about 4,000 trucks are already running between Lashio and Kunming on the Burma Road. These vehicles were paid for by the Chinese in cash, while another 10,000 will be handled according to the terms of the Lend-Lease Act, and should be available around the spring. (4th Reuters)

### Chinese Troops in the Yangtze River Valley Continuously Attack Japanese Positions: Restraining the Japanese Army, Preventing Them from Transferring Troops; Fighting in Nanchang, Shaoxing and Other Places

Chongqing - A Chinese military spokesman told reporters this afternoon that Chinese troops in the Yangtze River Valley are currently continuously attacking Japanese positions east of Nanchang on the south bank, with the aim of restraining the Japanese army and preventing them from transferring large numbers of troops to other fronts.

### All Sectors of Hong Kong's Military and Civilians are Extremely Calm

Hong Kong - All sectors of Hong Kong's military and civilians are maintaining a calm and prepared atmosphere. If the situation in Hong Kong can be regarded as a barometer of the response to the Pacific crisis, then the morale of the democratic groups in the Far East is undoubtedly very strong. The Hong Kong government issued evacuation recommendations on the night of the 1st, but there was no panic among the citizens. The government announced in a notice that the authorities would prepare a ship to evacuate people who voluntarily leave Hong Kong, but it has been learned today that there were too few bookings for cabins on the ship, so the previous proposal has been temporarily cancelled and the ship will not sail. Hong Kong is now taking various precautionary measures in a calm and quiet atmosphere, such as "small-scale" deployments of troops to guard the New Territories and Hong Kong's defense positions, and the establishment of several more agencies from the 7th to recruit heads of defense corps. Chinese newspapers here, such as Ta Kung Pao, National Daily, and Sing Tao Daily, have notified the government that if war breaks out, they will continue to publish as usual. (3rd Telegram)

### Central Government Agencies Decide on New Year's Day Commemoration Measures: In addition to Holding Celebrations as Usual, Also Comforting Honored Soldiers, etc.

Chongqing - The Ministry of Social Affairs, the Central Propaganda Department, the Central Headquarters of the Three People's Principles Youth League, and the Political Department have jointly decided on the commemoration measures for New Year's Day next year. In addition to holding celebrations as usual, the following activities should also be launched: Comforting honored soldiers, soldiers in the military, and families of soldiers who have gone to war. In the capital, the National Comforting Association and the National Women's Comforting Association will jointly handle the matter. In various provinces and cities, local mobilization agencies will consult with relevant agencies and groups to handle the matter. The method of comforting should be practical and thorough, so as to achieve practical results. Labor service activities will be held a few days before New Year's Day or, at the discretion of the situation, on February 19, the 8th anniversary of the New Life Movement. The provincial and municipal governments should take the original planned outline of administration and the core work in the water conservancy, afforestation, road construction, and other economic construction and public welfare undertakings, consider the local conditions and actual needs, distinguish the priorities and combine them with the national labor service and the New Life Labor Service Movement, mobilize people from all walks of life to promote them in unison.

It is reported that the Ministry of Social Affairs, etc., have telegraphed their subordinates to comply. (4th Telegram)

Editorial

### Churchill's Warning

According to a United Press report from London, on the 2nd of this month, British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons, issuing two warnings: The war is about to spread to the East; Hitler will mobilize troops westward at any time to attack Britain. Churchill's words were spoken during a debate on the "Expanding Mobilization of the British People" bill, and of course contained the intention of encouraging the British people; but at the same time, it was by no means an exaggeration, but a correct judgment based on objective facts and aimed at the current overall situation. Therefore, the two warnings raised by Churchill should not only be paid special attention to by the British people, but also have world importance.

Churchill's statement that the war is about to spread to the East of course refers to the Pacific. In recent days, the urgency of the Far Eastern situation has been widely recognized. The British preparations for this can be said to have never been relaxed. This week, a powerful fleet including the Prince of Wales will be deployed to Singapore, which is equivalent to announcing that Britain will take action against Japan and will no longer make useless empty statements. The urgency of the Far Eastern situation can be easily measured from this. At present, the only hope is pinned on the US-Japan talks in Washington. The US-Japan talks, after encountering difficulties on the 26th of last month, have not reached a final breakdown due to the fact that Kurosawa and Nomura visited Hull and Welles on the 1st and 2nd of this month, but the atmosphere of these two meetings was significantly different from before. In the past, there were probably some consultations, discussions, or exchanges of views, but in these two recent meetings, the Japanese side was clearly at a loss for words. As Nomura said, when they met, "Mr. Welles spoke eloquently, while we listened silently." Japan has postponed replying to Hull's memorandum, which stated the basic position of the United States, and there is no sign of improvement in Tokyo's attitude towards the United States; however, Kurosawa is still staying in Washington and has no intention of returning. This intention cannot but be interpreted as a delaying tactic. Once the purpose of delay is achieved, Japan will disregard everything.

Japan's repeated delays to the United States are mainly for two purposes: First, Japan still has to carry out some deployments in the Indochina Peninsula and the Pacific, such as military preparations in Vietnam and other places, and the psychological warfare against Thailand, all of which require considerable time to complete. Second, and more importantly, Japan probably has high expectations for Germany in the West: and in order to encourage Japan to move south rapidly, so as to cause trouble for Britain and the United States in the East, Germany will definitely respond to Japan's expectations and make some expressions. One of the most likely actions is to attack Britain.

In this European war, Germany has made some miscalculations about Britain: When German troops invaded Poland in September of the previous year, they believed that Britain would not participate in the war because of this, but as a result, Britain did participate in the war. After France was defeated in June of last year, Germany believed that Britain was no longer worthy of attention, so they changed their strategy to conquer Southeastern Europe with all their strength. As a result, Britain gained sufficient time to strengthen its military power, while Germany, due to its active promotion of the eastward policy, had an unavoidable major conflict with the Soviet Union, which eventually led to the outbreak of the German-Soviet War. On the eve of the imminent outbreak of the German-Soviet War, the Germans still believed that Britain could negotiate peace with Germany and form an anti-Soviet crusade, and even sent Hess to fly to Britain to attempt something, but the result was a complete failure. Not only did Britain and the Soviet Union form a military alliance, but the United States also became closely integrated with the Soviet Union through Britain. Germany also made miscalculations about Britain's production capacity and military power. Germany believed that the activities of the air force and submarines could destroy the industry and foreign transportation of the British Isles; but as a result, Britain was not only able to repel the attacks of German aircraft and clear the sea lanes, but also, with the assistance of the United States, produced a large number of aircraft and tanks, which, in addition to supplying its own needs, were continuously imported into the Soviet Union to attack the German troops who invaded the East.

Therefore, when the German-Soviet War is about to be half a year old, and the German blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union has completely failed, Britain is becoming increasingly powerful. Germany must increase its fear of this maritime lion in its rear and must quickly seek to deal with it with all its strength. Previously, Germany's ambition was to open up the Caucasus and the Iranian Plateau, invade India, and complete the military coordination with Japan, the axis country in the East; but this ambition has recently been shattered by the Soviet Union's great victory in the Battle of Rostov. All of this has made Germany have to change its course and seek new ways to open up. For example, Hitler's representative Goering met with French President Pétain on the 1st of this month, and it is widely rumored that he asked France to hand over the fleet, which may be a preparation for attacking Britain and containing the United States. And this new action is exactly what Japan is waiting for.

But how much attacking power does Germany still have now? Can the German army overcome the dangers of the English Channel? Or can Germany strike Britain through other means? All of this is still in question. Japan, with its arrow on the string, can hardly wait for a long time; or even if Japan intends to delay in order to wait for the launch of Germany's new offensive, the United States will never be easily fooled and allowed. Therefore, in the two warnings raised by Churchill, the outbreak of the Pacific War may be earlier than the expansion of the Western European war; but in any case, between the two, just like when the copper mountain in the west collapses, the bronze bell in the east responds, they are closely related and cannot be separated.

### Southern Route Red Army Swiftly Advances Flanking, German Army Already in General Retreat, Slight German Progress in the Klin Area, Fierce Fighting in the Mozhaisk Area

Reuters, Kubyshev, 4th – It is reported that the German army is in general retreat along the line from Taganrog to Mariupol. Soviet forces, advancing swiftly northward to flank the German army, are reported to have caught up with the vanguard of the retreating German forces. The slower-moving enemy units have been cut off. Several Italian divisions, previously deployed to support the German retreat, are also reported to be retreating. Even if many enemy soldiers escape, the Soviet army has achieved a great victory in terms of captured war materiel, especially vehicles and tanks. Restoration work in Rostov is now underway. Electricity, telecommunications, and telephone services are being restored. Thousands of residents are helping to clear everything up. It is also reported that two villages near Tikhvin, 100 miles from Leningrad, have been recaptured by Soviet forces, with 5,000 German soldiers killed. The Soviets also destroyed 32 enemy tanks and 353 vehicles. The German attempt to capture Leningrad has now failed, and German operations have been halted. Recent news from Moscow indicates that German tank expert Guderian has not abandoned his intention to attack Kashira from Stalinogorsk in the north. He is deploying new troops to try again. However, after Soviet forces stopped the German 17th Tank Division, etc., their vanguard cavalry is continuing to advance swiftly. The German army initially hoped to pause after retreating, but due to the relentless pursuit by Soviet forces, they continue to retreat. The Soviet side claims to have recaptured seven more villages and towns. Fierce fighting continues in other areas of the Tula front. German forces in the northwest of Tula are still very strong.

Reuters, London, 4th – According to official sources in Kubyshev, fighting west of Moscow remains as fierce as before. German forces on the southeastern front retreated in disarray on Wednesday and are now withdrawing from Taganrog, 50 miles west of Rostov. TASS news agency reports from the southern front that General Kleist's forces have been routed and are retreating. Only four rear-guard infantry units, supported by tanks, are putting up some resistance. Soviet forces are pursuing vigorously. It is known that two Italian divisions have arrived on the southern front, but some have already begun to surrender. A large number of enemy tanks, artillery, and trucks have been captured by the Soviet vanguard. The weather is becoming increasingly cold, exacerbating the difficulties for the German army. Many German soldiers have been found frozen to death. According to reports from Turkey, the German side is now redeploying troops from the Crimean Peninsula to try to halt the advance of Timoshenko's Soviet forces. Patrols are reportedly clashing in other areas of the southern front. The German side is erecting road signs along the route of their retreating troops, with the inscription "To Mariupol." One Soviet unit has recovered ten villages. Another Soviet unit destroyed several trucks carrying infantry, capturing a large amount of ammunition and 21 artillery pieces. Meanwhile, on the Moscow front, the German side is deploying large forces to the Volokolamsk, Mozhaisk, and Maloyaroslavets areas for combat. Soviet sources admit that the German army has made some progress and say that the situation is tense and serious, especially in the Volokolamsk area. In the Mozhaisk area, two German infantry divisions are engaged in combat between two rivers, and the fighting is extremely fierce. Last night's Soviet communique only stated that Soviet forces were engaged in combat with the enemy along the entire front. On Tuesday, 55 German aircraft were destroyed, and 17 Soviet aircraft were lost. A supplementary announcement stated that on Tuesday, the Soviet Air Force destroyed 154 German tanks, 1,114 trucks carrying troops and supplies, 50 field artillery and anti-aircraft guns, and 254 armored vehicles.

German Troops Driven Back 15 Miles in the Kalinin Area

Havas, Stockholm, 3rd – According to reports from the Soviet front, elite Red Army units are being continuously deployed to reinforce key positions in the Moscow area. German claims of having penetrated a "new area" apparently refer to the southeast of Klin. However, the Soviet radio announced that German troops have been driven back 15 miles to their original positions in the Kalinin area. Fighting on the northern front has also been very active in recent days. The Red Army has repeatedly broken through from the Leningrad area and now seems to be launching a large-scale counter-offensive with combined infantry and artillery. Military observers point out that since Lake Ladoga froze, the defenders of Leningrad are no longer isolated. The Red Army is now using the lake to re-establish contact with enemy forces north of Tikhvin and in the Volkhovstroy lake dam area. The battle for Tikhvin between the German and Soviet armies is very fierce. German forces occupied it on the 10th of last month, and by the end of the month, the Red Army had almost encircled it. Subsequently, the Red Army changed its direction of attack and advanced towards the railway line between Volkhovstroy and Tikhvin. The railway has not been occupied by the German army. The fighting there is now unprecedentedly fierce, with heavy losses on both sides. The Red Army seems determined to sacrifice a huge number of soldiers and equipment to recapture this position in order to alleviate the threat to the Leningrad-Vologda railway and strengthen the forces defending Leningrad. In addition, a Soviet convoy, protected by warships, sailed from the Gulf of Finland to the Hanko Peninsula yesterday for the first time. This move seems to be aimed at withdrawing all or part of the forces from the Finnish bases, as these bases are not suitable for winter warfare. As for the other areas on the Finnish front, the positions have not changed. There has only been sporadic artillery fire, aerial bombardment, and reconnaissance.

Germans Launch Blitz Offensive on the Tula Front

United Press, London, 4th – Moscow Radio reported that the German army has concentrated most of its forces on the Moscow front and launched a large-scale blitzkrieg on Tula. Strong Nazi troops are attacking the Tula Soviet defense lines day and night in an attempt to break into Moscow. The German forces attacking Tula are receiving reinforcements almost every hour. As the German army tries to break into the city, artillery is also unleashing a fierce barrage on the city, causing heavy damage. However, Soviet forces are holding firm. Soviet artillery has silenced some German guns, and the Soviet defenders have not yielded an inch under the frenzied Nazi attacks. In another area of the Tula front, Soviet forces are consolidating some of the positions they captured during yesterday's offensive.

### Axis Forces in North Africa Still Trying to Resist, Germans Using Tank Units to Attack British Forces, Axis Powers Only Hold a Small Desert Area

Reuters, London, 4th – According to the latest news received in London last night, the fighting in Libya is temporarily paused. The attacking British forces, after two weeks of fierce fighting and significant advances, now need to rest in order to inspect their tanks and reorganize their troops. The British deployment has been disrupted by mobile warfare in the desert. The current enemy deployment is roughly as follows: The enemy forces between Sollum and Omar have had many of their strong outposts destroyed, and the remaining coastal enemy defenses have been isolated. The enemy has lost its forward supply bases. Southeast of Tobruk, there are remnants of Axis armored forces. Southwest and west of Tobruk, there are still large Axis forces. The British garrison in Tobruk launched a突击向东南, breaking through the Axis encirclement and protruding out, temporarily linking up with the British forces advancing from the southeast, but the link is not secure. There seems to be a gap between the Tobruk salient and the British forces to the south. The fighting has not ended, but the British army has a good chance of success with the help of the Royal Air Force, which has air superiority in the area.

Reuters, Cairo, 4th – German General Rommel in North Africa shows no signs of intending to retreat west through the gap at Tobruk. It is expected that there will be very fierce fighting, with tanks at the forefront, in the coming days. The leading British units are now focused on destroying the main tank strength of the German army. Rommel is determined to use his still numerous tanks to disrupt the positions occupied by British forces along the road between Tobruk and Sollum. A brigade of British armored troops has completed one of the greatest mobile feats in military history. For two weeks, these British troops fought during the day and continued to advance rapidly at night, covering about 1,000 miles.

Reuters, London, 4th – Heavy rain has hampered the movement of mechanized units on both sides, so the Al-Raziq area, the main battlefield in Libya, has now temporarily fallen silent. However, British reconnaissance units are still near the border, systematically clearing up the resistance of scattered Axis forces. Enemy lines of communication are constantly under threat of being cut off, as British armored units and the Air Force are ready to attack anytime, anywhere. The main force of the British Eighth Army has established a strong new line from the Egyptian border to the area of ​​Gobi, 35 miles south of Tobruk. All scattered units are being withdrawn to this solid front line. The next stage of the campaign will be launched from this location. General Cunningham has ended the "wheel" battle of the past two weeks with this strategic shift. The Axis forces under General Rommel now only hold a sandy area 35 miles deep and 60 miles long. There are three reasons for the current pause in the fighting: reorganization and replenishment, troop fatigue, and bad weather.

### Stalin Receives Polish Prime Minister, Talks Last Two Hours

TASS, Moscow, 4th – On the night of the 3rd, Soviet Defense Committee Chairman Stalin received Polish Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief Sikorski at the Kremlin. Soviet People's Commissar Molotov and the Commander-in-Chief of Polish forces in the Soviet Union were also present. The talks lasted for two hours.

Reuters, Kubyshev, 4th – Polish Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief Sikorski arrived here from the Middle East yesterday and has met with Soviet Supreme Soviet Chairman Kalinin and Deputy Foreign Commissar Vyshinsky. Commenting on the situation on the Eastern Front, Sikorski said that he was not surprised by the Soviet defense, as he knew the capabilities of the Soviet soldiers. He had visited Polish troops in Tobruk and was pleased to learn of the success of Polish submarines in the Mediterranean. He believes that the Allies will win a great victory in Libya because British Commander-in-Chief Auchinleck already knows everything about German General Rommel's actions. He concluded by saying that he had come to the Soviet Union seeking practical results and had great confidence in the Polish forces being formed in the Soviet Union. The Polish forces are currently equipped with Soviet weapons, but the British Prime Minister and the US President will provide the equipment needed in the future.

TASS, Shanghai – Tonight at 11:30 PM (Shanghai time), seven Moscow radio stations will broadcast the speech of Polish Prime Minister Sikorski. The shortwave frequencies for the broadcast are as follows: 28.76 meters, 39.60 meters, 39.89 meters, 43.00 meters, 50.68 meters, 50.93 meters, 65.93 meters.

### German Military Doctor in Paris Assassinated Again, German Authorities Announce Martial Law

Haitong News Agency, Paris, 4th – General Schaumburg, the commander of Paris, issued a proclamation to the citizens yesterday, stating: "On the night of December 2nd, another German medical officer was shot. The French police authorities have not yet captured the murderer, indicating that there are still people in Paris who are harboring terrorists and supplying them with weapons and explosives.

### Neutral Cargo Ships Maintain Overseas Transport Lines, All British Merchant Ships Cease Operations After Departure, Huangpu Riverbank Suddenly Appears Desolate, Jardine Matheson Manager Responsible for Cargo Transportation on Panama Ships

After the suspension of British and American ships on the Far East route, traffic between this city and overseas is only barely maintained by a small number of French ships, etc. The Moller ships of British firm Messrs. Ready, the small oil tankers of Asiatic Petroleum Company, and the small oil tankers of Socony Mobil are also preparing to sail south one after another. The two Moller ships, Ready Moller and Maric Moller, are scheduled to leave for Hong Kong today. The three shallow-draft ships of Butterfield & Swire, which were berthed at the Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong, were moved to the Puxi Wharf on the afternoon of the day before yesterday.

Desolate Scene Along the Huangpu Riverbank

The Glen Line steamer, "Guzsils Sistreks," was moved from Pudong to No. 2 Wharf in Puxi on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, and yesterday morning, it was suddenly moved to No. 4 Wharf, alongside the "Jintang" and "Suiding." More than ten iron cargo barges and four small steam launches, which were moored in Pudong, were also moved to the Jardine Matheson Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession yesterday morning. Recalling the Bund area from Rue du Consulat to Shiliupu, the wharves have always been connected end to end with ships, loading and unloading cargo, and the workers were extremely busy. The reporter visited the area yesterday and found that the Butterfield & Swire wharves only had three shallow-draft ships and more than ten iron barges moored there. The Roosevelt Wharf was exceptionally quiet. Standing on the wharf at Xinkaihe, one could see directly to the Xinjiangtian Wharf at Shiliupu. Only many wooden-hulled barges were moored idle along the wharf. More than a thousand cases of Jardine Matheson beer, which were intended to be exported on the Yuesheng, were still piled up next to the wharves along the shore. It is said that they will be moved soon.

Panama Ships Responsible for Cargo Transportation

It is also confirmed that a Panama ship, the S.S. Morazan, will arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong this afternoon and will moor at the Roosevelt Wharf. It will load 27,700 bags of foreign rice, which belong to the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC). Another ship, the S.S. Boyata, is carrying coal from Nanyang to Shanghai and will arrive at port in the coming days. It is scheduled to moor at the Qichang Zhan in Pudong to unload. Both Panama ships are managed by the Foreign Shipping Department of Jardine Matheson. It is rumored that the Morazan is preparing to operate regularly between Shanghai and Rangoon, specializing in carrying foreign rice for the SMC. The company also intends to have the two Panama ships call at Hong Kong, so that they can load goods from Hong Kong. This is currently being planned and whether it can be implemented will be decided after the two ships arrive in Shanghai. The Sino-Japanese liaison line is operating as usual. The Shanghai Maru entered port around noon yesterday and is scheduled to return to Kobe from Shanghai at 9:00 AM this morning.

French and Portuguese Ships Suddenly Busy

After American liners and British Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire ships were ordered to cease operations in Shanghai and await government dispatch, Shanghai's shipping industry suffered a serious crisis, and industrial and commercial development was also threatened. However, according to shipping circles yesterday, Shanghai's sea transport is not yet in a desperate situation, because the French Mail Company's ships, such as the General Joffre, the Grand D'Artagnan, and the Gange, and other Panama merchant ships, as well as the French Mail ships, are operating to the Philippines and Vietnam. Panama ships are operating to Hong Kong, and Portuguese ships, such as the Paloto, are specially carrying coal from Hongji to Shanghai.

Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire Continue to Operate

Due to the sudden shipping measures, it was rumored that the Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire shipping companies would cease operations. However, according to reporters from the company yesterday, although the ships belonging to the company have been ordered to cease operations and concentrate in Hong Kong for dispatch, the Shanghai office will continue to operate and the Chinese and foreign staff will not be dismissed. It was found that after the two companies were ordered to concentrate their ships in Hong Kong, the ships that had come from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and then diverted, included Butterfield & Swire's Qiongzhou, Guiyang, Chengdu, and Jiaying, and Jardine Matheson's Yuesheng, Fusheng, and Guisheng. The ships at the North China ports, such as the Xin Beijing and Ganzhou, accelerated directly to Hong Kong. The Rikuyo Maru, which sailed north from Shanghai on the 2nd, has also been taken to Hong Kong along with the cargo.

Japan Mail Cancels Three Lines

The Shanghai branch of Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) received a telegram from the head office on the 3rd, stating that it had ordered the Manila, New York, and Canadian branches to withdraw immediately. It is rumored that the above three lines are all major routes of NYK. There were originally three 8,000-ton class ships between Japan and Canada each month, one 10,000-ton class ship between Manila and Australia each month, and two 17,000-ton class ships between Japan and 香山 each month. Two new 8,000-ton class ships operated between Japan and New York each month. After the order to withdraw, each of the three branches will retain two or three staff members to handle all unfinished matters. Two ships currently sailing in the Honolulu, Singapore, and South American routes have also decided to withdraw.

### Rice Stored in Godowns Outside the Settlement Will Be Sold Publicly, Although the Shipping Situation is Deteriorating, the Stockpiles of Important Goods are Full

An official from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Control Office stated that the SMC hopes to set a price limit for flour in the near future. The Price Control Office is continuing to investigate the amount of rice sold since November 10th, the date of establishment of the office. It will be able to determine the amount of rice needed by the citizens each month within a few days and announce it. The rice in the Public Settlement is not only supplied to the Settlement, but also to the areas outside the Settlement in West Shanghai and Zhabei. It is rumored that there is a large amount of rice stored in godowns outside the Settlement, which will be taken out and sold publicly. The shipping situation in this city is now deteriorating, but according to SMC officials yesterday, there are large stockpiles of rice and other essential goods in this city, sufficient for several months. The SMC is doing its best to obtain ships to carry supplies to Shanghai.

### SMC Considering Establishing a Chinese Necessities Association, Prices of Coal Briquettes Should be Reduced Quickly Through Consultations with Operating Merchants

Until recently, the various prices announced by the SMC, such as milk and canned food, were mostly not necessities for the daily lives of the Chinese. Therefore, the vast Chinese residents in the Settlement were very confused. The SMC has already paid attention to this issue and is currently considering establishing an association of merchants operating Chinese necessities in order to formulate a price limit for Chinese necessities. The SMC authorities are currently studying the allocation method of the statutory foreign exchange promised to be supplied by the Equalization Fund. Among them, the coal item is allowed to be supplied with foreign exchange. The SMC has now used a portion of this foreign exchange to order a large amount of coal from abroad, so the future market price of coal will definitely fall significantly. The market price of coal briquettes can also be reduced as a result. However, for residents in the Settlement, coal briquettes are the second most essential commodity after rice. The current market price of coal briquettes is too high, and the SMC should reduce it quickly. The evaluation of coal briquettes has not been reduced, and citizens have various reasons for this.

### "E" Police District Organizes Security, 38 Japanese Police Officers Arrive in Shanghai

According to the Police Department, "the date of establishment of the 'E' Police District north of Suzhou Creek has not yet been decided," but it will begin work soon. The detailed method of the organization of the E District police force is currently being discussed by the SMC and the Police Department with the Japanese authorities. There will be many Japanese police officers in the force, and its captain will also be appointed by a Japanese person. According to official sources yesterday morning, 38 new Japanese police officers have departed from Japan and arrived in Shanghai, preparing to join the SMC Police Department as reserve police officers. This move does not indicate that the number of Japanese police officers in the Police Department will increase. They are to fill vacancies when Japanese police officers resign. The new Japanese police officers of the SMC Police Department are currently being recruited and trained in Japan and come to Shanghai from Japan every one or two years to join the Police Department.

### Chinese Army Raids Zhujiajiao Town

According to people from Zhujiajiao Town in Qingpu County, in the deep night of the 27th of last month, a large team of Chinese army suddenly arrived and attacked Zhujiajiao, breaking into the town and disarming all the troops stationed there. At that time, the Japanese army took refuge in the fortresses and bombarded the Chinese army with small cannons, but the Chinese army was not damaged. After completing their mission, they withdrew safely. It was also rumored that when the Chinese army withdrew, they also captured the Japanese officials stationed in the town to collect land taxes, and their whereabouts are still unknown.

### Socony Mobil Kerosene Sales Method

Socony Mobil Oil Company stated that there is no shortage of kerosene in Shanghai, but in order to maintain existing stocks and prevent hoarding, only 17 retail stores are allowed to sell a limited amount of kerosene to Chinese citizens at a fixed price. The restriction method is that each person can only purchase one yuan, and the kerosene obtained can fill about one beer bottle. This price is cheaper than before the price limit. Foreigners who want to purchase kerosene can apply to the company for an oil allocation certificate and purchase the required kerosene at a nearby service station with the certificate. Chinese merchants who need a large amount of kerosene must apply for an oil allocation certificate in this way. After the company determines the amount of kerosene they needed previously, it will then determine how much to allow them to sell each month.

### Electricity Company Sends Representatives to Hong Kong to Request Foreign Exchange

Since the Equalization Fund notified the Shanghai Power Company that it would reduce the supply of foreign exchange for coal by 20%, the company considered this matter to be of great importance. Therefore, on the 28th of last month, it specially sent Deputy Manager Salis to Hong Kong to explain the situation of the company's need for sufficient coal. It is rumored that the reason the Equalization Fund announced the reduction in the supply of foreign exchange to the company was because the SMC had already obtained US$1 million in foreign exchange per month for coal from the fund, which could purchase sufficient coal.

### Two More Stores Have Their Licenses Revoked

The SMC's Industry and Social Affairs Department is now working closely with the Medical Department to investigate whether retail stores are selling goods at the fixed price. Before taking active action, it will first issue warnings, but there are still some stores that violate the order. As of yesterday, there were already seven stores that had been ordered to suspend operations. Six of them were because the selling price exceeded the price limit, and the remaining one was for mixing inferior rice into the SMC's foreign rice. Two of the stores that had their licenses revoked for three days yesterday were a butcher shop and a food shop. Yesterday afternoon, notices were issued to four retail stores, ordering them to present reasons for objecting to being punished. According to officials, the SMC hopes that the public can provide urgent cooperation and report the names of stores that exceed the price limit to the SMC with the attached documents at any time, so that the SMC can immediately implement its work.

### The Bureau's Willingness to Bear the Financial Responsibility for Accommodating Beggars: The Salvation Army's Entrusted Plan for Beggar Camps Ultimately Not Realized

During a special meeting held by the Public Works Bureau Board on the afternoon of the previous (3rd) day, the issue of accommodating beggars was discussed. As a result, it was resolved to request the Salvation Army to continue operating the beggar asylum this winter, actively accommodating beggars. The asylum was established in December of last year.

Responsible for Expenses

Regarding the expenses of the asylum, although the Salvation Army hopes to obtain donations from the outside world, the Public Works Bureau is now prepared to bear the financial responsibility for the next few months. As for the plan previously hoped to be jointly implemented by the two concessions and the downtown area to establish a larger beggar district in an area not far from Shanghai, it will not be possible to realize it in time this winter. It is noted that the beggar asylum had not been fully accommodated in recent months due to the initiation of the above plan. Now that the above plan has not materialized, the beggar asylum should actively handle accommodation to achieve full scope.

And Plans to Repatriate

The bureau will also take all possible steps to repatriate the accommodated beggars. Regarding the expenses required for repatriation, it is planned to transfer the remaining funds from the former Refugee Repatriation Committee. The committee was established in 1937 and was dissolved in August of this year. All funds have been transferred to the Public Works Bureau to be used for the beggar asylum's responsibility for this winter. If one party alone handles direct relief efforts, the future is not without danger. Therefore, it is still hoped that people from all walks of life can generously donate to this charitable cause to facilitate its progress.

### British Manufacturers Decide to Implement a One-Shift Office System: Asiatic Petroleum Company First to Advocate

Asiatic Petroleum Company and other British manufacturers in this city have now decided to only work in the morning to save gasoline. According to the company, the amount of oil that should be saved today is even greater than usual because the current gasoline inventory is very small and the source is unreliable. If companies and factories only work in the morning, employees will only need gasoline for two trips a day instead of four trips a day, which can save a lot. Therefore, Asiatic Petroleum Company has decided to work from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM every day starting Monday (the 8th).

At 7:50 yesterday morning, a kidnapping case of two Ma brothers, young students, suddenly occurred at the entrance of McTyeire School on Medhurst Road, a cross-border road in the Shanghai Fourth District. A black-plated car with concession license number 1445, in which the two students were riding, disappeared.

### Negotiations Between Color Printing Industry Labor and Management Break Down: Two Representatives Beaten

Workers in the city's color printing industry went on strike once in May of this year. After wages were generally increased, work was resumed. Unexpectedly, on the 10th of last month, the workers suddenly declared a strike again, demanding increased wages. The employers appointed six representatives: Xia Pengnian (Dahua), Wu Youzhang (Xiesheng), Yang Zhengyong (Dalan), Mao Xiaoqing (Xiangji), Qian Fulin (Meihua), and Shao Zimin (Sida). They contacted the labor representatives several times, willing to increase wages by 30% and provide a uniform rice subsidy of 4.5 dou. However, the labor representatives insisted on a 100% increase and a rice subsidy of 5 dou, resulting in a stalemate. Afterwards, some of the representatives received threatening letters with bullets, which made them feel disheartened. After repeated invitations from the labor representatives, negotiations resumed yesterday morning. As a result of the wide gap in conditions, the negotiations broke down again. Around 11:00 AM, as the representatives were leaving and about to board their cars, dozens of striking workers who had been lying in wait on the side of the road suddenly rushed out and used force. They dragged the representatives out of the cars and beat them with sticks, causing Wu Youzhang and Mao Xiaoqing to be severely injured. The cars were also vandalized. The street police arrived to suppress the violence and arrested three of the attacking workers. After questioning them at the Hongkou Police Station, they were sent to the court for prosecution.

The first two matches are Group B: Yi Guang vs. Yi Guang, Hua Nan vs. French Police. Hua Nan is a strong team in Group B.

### Gold Fluctuates Unsteadily

Yesterday's spot gold market was still fluctuating unsteadily. It rose first and then fell, causing much confusion. Because the war clouds are gathering in the Far East, it is feared that shipments from Hong Kong will disappear from now on. The Xiang Xing Yong Li Jin gang placed an order for 670 taels. The securities firm placed an order for 530 taels. He Cheng Shun Yuan Xiang He Hui Piao firm Cheng Da De Cheng Jin Wei Yi Hong also placed orders. However, there was a rumor that gold from North Korea was being shipped to Shanghai. A securities firm representing the Tianjin gang vigorously sold 900 taels in the morning (and then bought back 120 taels in the afternoon). Tian Yuan cleared out 1,010 taels throughout the day. Yong Cheng cleared out 830 taels. Therefore, the rising trend was suppressed. The price rose to 15,850 yuan and then retreated. In the afternoon, it reached 14,950 yuan. Finally, the banking gang came in to support it, and the closing price was still up 80 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 25,140 taels.

15,000 Yuan Entered and Exited Again

From the morning, when the market opened at 9:00 AM, each bar (ten taels) rose by 300 yuan, to 15,500 yuan. Xiang He, Tian Yuan, and Yong Cheng came to vigorously sell, and it immediately fell by 300 yuan, to 15,200 yuan. Suddenly, Xiang Xing and Yong, from the Hong Kong gang, came to cover their short positions. Gong He, He Sheng, Ming Feng, Cheng Da, and De Cheng scrambled to buy. Xiang He even bought back aggressively. The price immediately rose sharply by 650 yuan, to 15,850 yuan. However, the securities firms from the Tianjin gang and Yong Cheng Tian Yuan were still dumping huge amounts. Ding Sheng, Heng Ji, De Da, and Shun Yuan were also eager to sell. It immediately fell by 470 yuan, to 15,280 yuan. The noon closing price was 15,300 yuan. When the market opened at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, it immediately fell by 200 yuan, to 15,100 yuan, because Yong Cheng was vigorously selling. Securities firms entered and rose to 15,200 yuan. Gong He, Tian Yuan, Hong Qing, Shui Yong Cheng came to compete to sell, and the market retreated to 14,950 yuan. Securities firms came to absorb again. Shun Yuan, Wan Feng, and remittance firms came to support, raising it by 350 yuan, to 15,300 yuan. The closing price at 4:00 PM was 15,280 yuan, an increase of 80 yuan compared to the previous day. The high and low for the whole day was 900 yuan. The retail price of spot gold from cash shops was 15,500 yuan. The purchase price was 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.

Jewelry Gold Rose, Silver Fell

The price of jewelry gold changed four times a day. Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang initially listed it at 1,630 yuan, and then it fell by 50 yuan, to 1,580 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by 150 yuan), an increase of 20 yuan. Silver was listed at a small two yuan, totaling 20 yuan. The black market price was 16 or 17 yuan.

### Black Market Exchange Rates, Unpredictable

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: the Central Bank and HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. HSBC and other small counters' prices were all flat. The black market exchange rates for the British pound and the US dollar were flat for the British pound and loose for the US dollar. There were no formal market prices, and it all depended on the supply and demand at the time, resulting in unexpected and unpredictable fluctuations. The US dollar originally had a price of 3.375 yuan with a household. A certain Chinese businessman-broker transferred funds at Chase Bank, shouting down to a low price of 3.625 yuan to sell. Import foreign firms that were not allowed to apply did not make any arrangements. However, the buying price for the British pound was low at 3.225 yuan. The future may also have the possibility of long-term release. However, it suddenly turned silent in the afternoon. According to the prices quoted by all parties at 4:00 PM, the British gold price was 3.225 yuan, and the US dollar price was 3.625 yuan. The British pound was flat, and the US dollar was up by 0.25 yuan.

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: the trend of British and American gold pounds was stable, and the market price stood flat. The British gold ticket also tended to fall. The US gold ticket once rose as high as 30.8 yuan, and the final price was 29.8 yuan, resulting in the same as the previous day. The Hong Kong ticket continued to trend downward. Japanese gold tickets and North Korean tickets, military tickets, etc. all tended to weaken. The former retreated to 2.6 yuan, followed by 2.2 yuan, and the latter was 3.33 yuan.

Hong Kong, 4th (Thursday) Telegram: The exchange market opened steadily this morning, and all exchange rates were neither glorious nor disgraced.

Tianjin, 4th (Thursday) Telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The London and New York telegraphic transfers remained unchanged. There was a market without a price. Shanghai remittance rose by two yuan, to eighty yuan. The United Banknote black market slightly increased by half a corner, to forty-nine yuan.

### Although the Bulls of Shuang Ma Can Be Closed Out, They Are Ultimately Exhausted by the Factory's Sell-Off

The yarn market trend is gradually entering a stable state. However, the public's mentality is not optimistic. Therefore, when the market rises, sellers are extremely enthusiastic, and prices cannot rise. The pressure is heavy. However, some parties still adhere to the principle of buying on dips, and the amount purchased is already huge. Because the Shuang Ma market is strong, although there have been sell-offs recently, part of it has already shown the intention of receiving it, because the change of the factory's order is relatively cheap. Therefore, the swap discount is lighter. Today, the bulls are discounted to the sellers by two and a half yuan. In the end, there is also the saying of flat snatching. The highest price of 20-count Shuang Ma was 2,500 yuan, and the lowest price was 2,420 yuan.

Shuang Ma opened in the morning. Because the bulls were discounted at the end of the previous day's swap, people's hearts were better, and the first pan rose by 30 yuan, to 2,470 yuan. It hovered at this price for a while. Then, the exchange opened, and the prices of yarn and cloth rose. People's hearts were strong. At the same time, gold was very expensive. Floating short covering, the market gradually moved forward to 2,500 yuan. When the price rose, short selling became active again. The factory slightly sold off, and the situation was more exhausted, closing at 2,410 yuan. It was found that the transaction statistics for half a day were 2,150 packages. The market was sluggish when it opened in the afternoon because everyone was pessimistic. The price was 2,435 yuan. Afterwards, it was held at 2,421 yuan to 25 yuan, but the new throwers were also wary. The final closing price was 2,437 yuan, and the off-market price was 40 yuan to 45 yuan.

The Shuang Ma futures market situation changed from strong to sluggish, and the trend did not deviate from the roundabout situation. The development of the situation in all aspects is abrupt. As for the extent to which it will develop, it makes both sides uneasy. The most worrying factor is the contraction of silver, which makes the potential of the bulls weaken. Therefore, the market is brewing. Although it has reversed the previous example and is higher than the spot yarn, it is ultimately presented in a hovering state due to the expectation of people's hearts. When it opened in the morning, it was first because of the re-rise of American cotton, and the gold market and factory orders once made great strides. Therefore, the recent futures yarn was 2502.00, with a slight strong trend, while January turned soft again, opening at 2575.00, and February at 2635.00. After entering, through the absorption of gold shops and securities gangs, it was once pulled up by 20 or 30 yuan, but then it fell back. The fluctuations were small in the afternoon, and it eventually tended to be depressed. The reason for the small return of the exchange was that it affected the general floating short-selling. Therefore, the market price was hovering and uneven, and the prices of the various months were quite inconsistent. As a result, the prices of the various months fell by more than 20 yuan to 50 yuan. The list is as follows:

The current cotton situation is as calm as ever. Although the factory has no movement, the fine lint cotton is still flat, but the coarse lint is inferior.

The New York cotton market is lively and strong. In the early morning, it first rose due to purchases by peers and Wall Street purchases. Afterwards, it continued to rise due to the good and easy sales of cotton cloth and speculative purchases. As a result, the closing price yesterday rose by 32 to 33 pounds each, respectively, compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market is closed. It is predicted that the market situation will open today. Due to the solid foothold of American cotton in recent days, it is expected to rise by about eight rupees.

### Cotton Cloth Ultimately Finds It Difficult to Rise; Mercerized Feather Yarn Is Expensively Priced

Factory Cloth: The market was strong in the morning and tired in the afternoon, still hovering, because the situation is strong and people's hearts are uneasy. As a result, the price of white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill fell by 0.5 to 1 yuan per bolt, and the price of bleached and dyed cloth fell by 1 to 2 yuan. Transactions in this street were more than 300 pieces of various cloths. Customer sales were as depressed as ever.

Eastern Cloth: Unable to rise, the closing price of the futures market of the exchange's colored ball fine cloth rose by about 0.5 yuan in the morning market, and then fell back by 1 yuan in the afternoon market. The closing price for this month was 85 yuan, a small decrease of 1 yuan compared to the previous day, January 88.01 yuan, a small 0.99 yuan, February 90.03 yuan, a small 0.7 yuan. The current spot leader fine cloth factory order fell by 0.25 yuan, and the evening closing price was 89.75 yuan. The closing situation of the Four Gentlemen's Serge was tired, at 3.265 yuan.

Mercerized Feather Yarn: It has been widely used and sold recently. Tailors of Western-style clothing all have a need for it. The selling price is also extremely expensive. Yesterday, the average price of No. 1 mercerized feather yarn with wax thread end was 8.5 yuan per yard. The selling price of ordinary yarn was 6.5 yuan to 7.5 yuan. The minimum selling price of low-end goods was also 5 yuan. Moreover, there is not much circulating in the market, because the factory's production is reduced by an average of two-thirds compared to the past.

### Internal Debt Buying Is Not Strong; Many Rubber Stocks Pay Dividends; Foreign Merchant Stocks Are Wavering and Falling

The multi-party on the public debt black market was unable to pull up the market yesterday, so it turned sharply weak. The popularity was originally low. The multi-party then slowly engaged in coming out of the cage. However, because there were few buyers, they could not do what they wanted. The major players have not wavered, and the future is still based on international issues. The market atmosphere in the morning was oversupplied. The opening price of Class C broke the 8-yuan mark. Sheng Xing and Jiu Feng bought, and Lian He and Yi Tai sold. However, the buyers were not very enthusiastic. The market was relatively flat in the afternoon. Heng Kang's selling was very strong. Jiu Feng and Hong Da's buying was still intentional or unintentional. As a result, the market price unanimously returned to a small triangle of 0.5 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 1.12 million yuan. A simple table is listed below:

Stock trading: 50 shares of Tianchu MSG Factory were traded, with a price of 355 yuan per share.

The manager of Huifeng Foreign Company, British Zhahua, and other five Oak Tree Co., Ltd. regularly distributed the interim dividend for 1941. The compilation is as follows:

British Zhahua: Issued on December 17, 2 yuan of national currency per share.

Keluohua: Issued on December 19, 0.15 yuan of national currency per share.

Zhahua Kangsha: Issued on December 19, 0.2 yuan of national currency per share.

Rubber: Issued on December 24, 1.5 yuan of national currency per share.

British Guda District: Issued on December 31, 1.5 yuan of national currency per share.

British Si Hai Insurance Co., Ltd. is scheduled to distribute the interim dividend for 1941 on December 15, with an annual interest rate of 2.5%, paid in Shanghai General Currency.

The public stock market is peaceful and quiet. The opening price was lower than the previous closing price. After opening, it continued to fall. It briefly recovered in the middle, but it softened again at the noon closing. The fluctuations were small in the afternoon, and the potential was also very sluggish.

### Flour Market Is Stable

Foreign rice stagnated, and the national rice market was without sales, however, peddlers did manage to transport a hundred odd bags of National Rice.

The flour market continued to be fair and stable. Dong Zhan flour, due to the stagnation of the customer gang, still lacked inflows and outflows. Since the Western Zhan registered flour was priced at 40.02 yuan by the Gong Bu Ju and directly distributed to each consumer, trading in the market was even quieter. Yesterday, hundreds of bags of Jin Long flour were traded, and the price fell by 0.5 yuan, selling at 40.05 yuan. Bran was popular due to the shortage of goods. Since the Japanese-owned San Xin successively dumped it, the market has gradually returned to stability. Yesterday, San Xin opened back at 54 yuan, which was also 0.5 yuan less than the previous market. Lan Hua brand customer bran was 52 yuan, which was more than 1 yuan less. However, the wheat stock was about to run out, and it still looked tall and handsome.

### Scattered Hoarding Frequently Unloads; Grains and Edible Oil Fall Back

The grain market situation yesterday saw a stop to the rise and turned flat, because actual sales have tended to decrease due to high prices, and scattered returns frequently loosened. Therefore, the price of edible oil was suppressed by 3 to 5 yuan. Soybeans were flat, and corn was first high and then tired. The total market transaction was 20 barrels each of Qingdao raw oil and soybean oil, 10 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 300 dan of Dayou Factory's clear oil, 200 dan of rapeseed oil, 100 barrels of Rihua Factory's rapeseed oil, 100 dan of Lide Factory's rapeseed oil, 300 dan of Yoshida Factory's rapeseed oil, more than 200 packages of Tianjin Xin Jin Yuan, and more than 100 packages of green beans, more than 3,000 packages of spot corn, and 500 tons of futures.

### Sugar Futures Stagnate Invisibly; Scattered Hoarding Seeks to Unload; The Declining Trend Has Not Been Suppressed

Yesterday's sugar market suffered because the Lian Ying Company was invisibly stagnant, and the scattered hoarding households urgently sought to unload, and people's hearts were even more weak, causing the market to decline step by step. There were no transactions in futures, and only more than 7,000 packages of spot goods were transacted. For example, the spot price of 24 coarse white for imports in November opened at 191 yuan in the morning and gradually fell to 80.70 yuan. In the afternoon, it still opened at 70 to 67 yuan, and then slightly rebounded to 70 to 77 yuan. As a result, it had to fall by 17.5 yuan compared to the previous market. October was 185 to 75.70 yuan in the morning, and 67.72.74 yuan in the afternoon. September was 180 to 70.61 yuan in the morning, and 65.71 yuan in the afternoon. August was 180.70 yuan in the morning, with a minimum of 57 yuan, and 60.64 yuan in the afternoon.

### Hong Ji Coal Rises Again—New Goods Arrive One After Another—

Since the French Public Board issued a notice limiting the price of Hong Shen white coal, the Public Concession is also paying close attention to registering coal storage for reference, and planning the selling price. However, starting yesterday, the industry suddenly stopped issuing orders, causing people's hearts to be agitated, and the black market rose again. However, new goods are arriving one after another. Yesterday, another ship loaded with more than 2,300 tons of Hong Ji lump coal arrived at the port and is being unloaded.

### Robbery, Matchmaking, Trial Marriage

— Mu Chang

Recently, rice has reached 130 (dollars per unit), and a bag of flour is limited to 40 yuan, so there are indeed many people suffering from malnutrition; however, it is said that there are even more young men and women busy getting married. Marriage is inherently very serious, but at this time and place, rushing for "public days" does not seem inappropriate. There is a book as evidence: "Men should have their roles, women should have their homes. People hate to see goods thrown away, but not necessarily to hoard them; they hate to see strength not used, but not necessarily for oneself..." A gentleman helps others achieve good things. Strike the iron while it's hot. A happy marriage, postponed until next year, might be even less economical, so everyone is doing it.

Considering the origins of marriage, since the Duke of Zhou, it seems to have become much more solemn. At present, although it is no longer regarded as a major undertaking, it does not detract from its sacredness. Unless you are an isolated individual, it seems to be necessary. Serious scholars like to quote the "Guan Ju" (Osprey) poem, joyous but not excessive, needless to say. Young lads in America have recently been suggesting "down with matchmakers," advocating a system of open matchmaking through direct negotiation, with matching social status, acting as if it were a serious matter. Progressive revolutionaries, for "comfort in work," although they dislike complicated rituals, and some "opportunistic wavering," are simply fulfilling the obligation of "trial marriage" when cohabitating... Therefore, I think that marriage is not a major undertaking in life, but merely one aspect of personal life, but in the process of family succession, it is called a "means." The choice of this means depends on whether careful consideration has been given beforehand, and whether the burdens of life afterward (spiritual and material) can be met comfortably.

Naturally, there are also those who fall behind or fail in this means. As for the low-grade tastes, as seen by the petty bourgeoisie: a certain Xiao Liu, now because of the high cost of everything, is unable to formally marry, so he invited clan uncles and fellow villagers to wait for his beloved to arrive late. With a shout, she was dragged into the "prepared" car and sped away. Needless to say, it was a "hasty affair." This kind of robbery marriage seems to have been discovered once recently in the foreign concessions, which is quite interesting. Although the custom of robbery marriage has existed since ancient times, there is no need to lament the decline of morals; however, now they actually use cars, which resembles "kidnapping," is it not strange!

After Yuan Zicai entered the Hanlin Academy, he submitted a memorial requesting leave to return home for his wedding, with the beautiful lines "The wind on Penglai Mountain is cold, the long nights are spent studying, the writing brush is adorned with gold and powder, and the robes are disordered in the early morning." This style of "the wedding night in the bridal chamber, the time of hanging the name on the golden list" has also existed since ancient times—this is of course "spiritualist classicism," and there is a huge difference between it and the personality of a certain Xiao Liu, but the subjective demands of a certain Xiao Liu and the self-expression of Yuan Zicai do not seem to be very far apart, the crux lies in the marriage problem, the difference is that the latter is unlearned.

Yuan Zicai's forte lies in "romantic stories," so he exaggerated the "process of union," thinking that this lifelong event was of utmost importance, thereby highlighting his literary talent and complementing each other—he still had a minimal political function, and being of utmost importance merely indicated that the lyricist belonged to a leisurely position. As for whether he can get subsidized rice from the Public Works Bureau after marriage, and limited-price flour, others need not worry: what is sad is that although a certain Xiao Liu has caught the chicken, how will he feed it afterward? (I apologize for still holding a petty bourgeois view here.) Not to mention that renting a car now costs nine yuan for twenty minutes, and the attic's communal kitchen must still be opened, this is called "fooling the people," is it not very sad?

Therefore, the law is nothing more than human sentiment, and the father-in-law does not find his son-in-law particularly interesting. The result of the robbery marriage is reporting to the authorities, "Xiao Liu, is he marriageable? Being in shackles is his crime!" (See the robbery marriage news in this newspaper on the 25th of last month.) Serves him right!

In this day and age, "the serious demands of real life" are a bit alarming. If you have a love interest, you want to blackmail your father—this is a small matter, but the result for wealthy families and bachelors is often no different, "is it not very sad?"

### Insisting on Saving Face Causes Suffering – I'm Treating You to a Wedding Feast

— Huan Jun

Sitting in a teahouse, I ran into a friend named Wu. After exchanging pleasantries, I heard him say that he was working for a certain foreign company and was very favored by the foreign boss, earning 300 yuan a month, which made me, whose recent situation was difficult, extremely envious.

"Old Huang! I'm treating you to a wedding feast next month," Xiao Wu said with a smile, taking a couple of sips of tea.

What? I knew before that he didn't have a lover, and I never heard any news of an engagement; after not seeing him for half a year, he suddenly got married. How could I not admire Xiao Wu's lightning-fast success? At a time when everything is incredibly expensive and the cost of living is at its peak, he has a large sum of money to settle this lifelong event, which makes this poor fellow even more jealous.

I said, "Xiao Wu! You really have great tricks and a good income. In these extraordinary times, you can comfortably be a groom... It probably costs several thousand to do this thing, right?"

"Of course, less won't do. At the engagement, you need these pieces of jewelry first: a gold bracelet, a platinum watch, two diamond rings, a pair of pearl earrings. Just these four items alone are very costly."

"Oh! Oh!"

"Although the gold bracelet is only 1.2 taels heavy, it costs more than 1,600 yuan, plus 900 yuan for the watch, 1,000 yuan for a pair of diamond rings, and 500 yuan for a pair of pearl earrings, totaling 4,600 yuan."

"Oh! Oh!"

"Also, there's a spring coat and a winter coat, four silk cheongsams, and other tea gifts, which add up to more than 2,000 yuan."

"Oh, oh, oh..."

"In addition, I spent 2,200 yuan to buy furniture for the new house, plus an estimated net expenditure of 600 yuan on the wedding day. Ha! Ha! Although it's not much, doing this one thing costs more than 9,000 yuan." Xiao Wu continued to say, I didn't know if he was boasting about being rich or mocking my poverty.

"More than 9,000 yuan! It takes such a large amount. I didn't realize you were a wealthy friend." Although I was suspicious, I still complimented him a few times.

"Wealthy... Alas! To tell you the truth, it's all borrowed." A layer of melancholy suddenly covered his face.

"Hmm, borrowed! Don't lie, who would believe that?" I shook my head slightly.

"If I didn't borrow, huh! Where would I get this money? Let me tell you, I even paid 2% interest."

"Really! How can this be good? After getting married, one plus one equals two. After having a son, two plus one equals three. In the future, there will be many mouths to feed, and expenses will increase sharply; however, due to paying interest, your income will be reduced by 20% or 30%. Xiao Wu! This life will be difficult. A person is light without debt, can't you try to save money?"

"Save money? Brother, you only know one thing, not the other. Now, in this era, who doesn't care about vanity, who doesn't want to save face? If you plan to save money, you can forget about getting a wife for the rest of your life." Xiao Wu said seriously. This is a matter of course, and an experience in getting a wife, how dare I say he is even half wrong? But how will Xiao Wu get rid of the heavy burden on his body?

Wedding feast! Wedding feast! It is an exchange of debt and interest, a prelude to sorrow and worry; where does the joy come from? What is there to be happy about?

### Hoarders Are Ubiquitous

— Yangtze River, Intended by Le Shuai, Drawn by Yang

### Buyers Pay Attention - The Issue of Measurement

— Cheng Qiu

Since the authorities have restricted prices, giving hoarders a serious blow, and recently restricted the prices of general daily necessities to curb the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, the authorities' favor is truly substantial.

Previously, the biggest headache for housewives every day was buying groceries. Prices soared, and although various vegetables were displayed in the market, they never knew which one to buy. Buying just a little bit of ordinary vegetables would cost about four or five yuan. If you wanted to eat some fish or meat, ah! That was truly a big deal.

After restricting prices, general vegetables were cheaper. Occasionally, you wanted to buy some meat to eat, and although the price was cheaper, a catty of meat now was far less than a catty of meat before. Some other things were also like this. In terms of measurement, they were always less than before. This was entirely the trickery of merchants. Although ordinary people enjoyed the benefits of the authorities' price restrictions, they were still secretly losing out. For example, with general vegetables, if you used your own scale and the seller's scale, there would be a difference in price.

The price set by the authorities is fixed in terms of measurement, but now there are two different measurements between buyers and sellers, so is it that the buyer's scale is too large and does not comply with the authorities' regulations, or is the store's scale too small? If the store's scale is too small, then it does not comply with the authorities' restrictions and violates the law. Therefore, I hope that in addition to the beneficial policy of restricting prices, the authorities will pay close attention to the measurement of general daily necessities on the market, so that unscrupulous merchants cannot take advantage of loopholes and violate the law, and ordinary people can receive greater and more concrete benefits. Eliminating evil must be thorough, which is probably something the authorities cannot ignore.

(Editor's Note) The authorities have been paying close attention to unscrupulous merchants using improper measuring instruments in the market; many have been found and severely punished. Hereby, we warn unscrupulous merchants not to be stubborn and continue to test the law, and buyers who are "losing out" should also be more careful themselves. (For goods that are liquid, it is advisable to prepare an extra measuring instrument.)

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Fifteen. Papa, let's go busking!

"I know what's on your mind," Mei Bao nodded, looking as if she understood her father's plight very well. "Originally, we are unfamiliar with this place, and being a primary school teacher is the best thing, but no one can introduce me; and last time I heard Mr. Qian say that the schools in Shanghai are almost all closed, so this path is basically impassable. As for other things, needless to say, Papa, you are worried, and I myself feel very dangerous. These past few days, I have been planning day and night, and I already have an idea, but I don't know what you think."

"What good idea do you have?" Begonia said looking very puzzled.

Because Mei Bao heard him cough several times in a row while he was speaking, she didn't answer immediately, but first stood up and poured out a bowl of jujube soup that she had cooked in advance, and handed it to her father to drink.

"Papa, can't I still sing opera..."

"No," Begonia interrupted her as soon as she said two words. "I can't let you perform on stage yet, don't mention this matter!"

"Then, Papa, let's go busking!" Mei Bao said softly, with a hint of a smile, snuggling beside her father.

"Busking? What do you mean by busking, who are we going to sell it to?" Begonia asked with wide, distracted eyes, extremely doubtful. (280)

### New Inventions in Cartoon Production

— Zai Yang

Producing cartoons is not an easy task. Everyone knows how difficult it is. Walt Disney mobilized hundreds of people and spent many years of effort to complete Snow White. Even the Chinese Iron Fan Princess, didn't the newspaper say that it took more than two hundred people to draw it? And these two hundred or more people are not just anyone, but artists! Because the characters in cartoons are dead and won't move on their own. You have to draw dozens of pictures to show one action. For example, raising a hand, dozens of pictures are almost the same, but the hand gradually rises. The background in these dozens of pictures is all the same. Therefore, cartoon producers feel the trouble of this repetitive work.

Now Hollywood has invented a new production method, that is, in addition to the characters in the cartoon, you can also shoot real backgrounds.

Originally, an opaque image is drawn on a transparent celluloid sheet - each character is painted with black and white paint. When viewed in a bright place, you only see the black outline of the picture, but when you use reflected light to illuminate it, the picture is clearly presented. Then, a pair of illuminating lights above shine on the drawing, and at the same time, the real movie set is projected from under the transparent celluloid. The characters in the drawing - that is, the opaque part - block part of the set. The background and continuous drawings are filmed simultaneously with a camera until the background and the characters in the drawing change. In this way, when it is shown, we can see the characters in the painting and remain in the real world!

This new cartoon production machine only needs to be equipped with an optical instrument condenser. If you want to shoot in five colors, you only need to paint the characters on the celluloid in five colors, and then add a rotating color separation filter to the condenser.

This new cartoon is better than the current cartoon production in terms of speed and economy.

Wait, and soon we will be able to see it.

### Harmonica Circle - Forming a National Association

— Philosopher

Because the harmonica is easy to learn and use, the number of students has been increasing in recent years, making it the most popular mass music. In the past, famous groups promoting the harmonica had no contact with each other and acted independently, which is a pity. Now, Mr. Chen Jianchen, president of the Shanghai Harmonica Association, has contacted harmonica enthusiasts to initiate the organization of the "All-China Harmonica Association", using collective power to jointly work hard for the harmonica music in our country, and achieve the practical effect of promotion. After three months of preparation, it has been established. The address of the general association is temporarily located in the Shanghai Harmonica Association in the Zhonghe Building on Shanxi Road, Nanjing Road, and invites Chinese and foreign musicians to teach harmony, violin, piano, etc., to conform to the purpose of promoting music. Membership is divided into two types: group and individual. Recruitment has just begun. According to the person in charge of the association, the number of applicants is very enthusiastic. Many letters have been received from as far away as the inland and Nanyang, which is a good phenomenon in the harmonica circle in our country.

Chapter 19: Dusk, the City Filled with Dust from the Nomad Cavalry

So the doubt in his heart was temporarily put down. He talked to Liu Yining about the situation in the army and on the battlefield. Liu Yining did not take the bandits to heart, but considered the Qing army to be a cause for concern. He always thought that Wu Sangui was double-dealing, harboring ulterior motives, and could not be loyal and resourceful, and stabilize the country for the former dynasty. Xu Jing was also worried about this. After talking for a long time, the evening drum had struck three times, so Xu Jing put out the candle and went to sleep on the opposite kang. The next day Xu Jing got up, and Liu Yining also wanted to get up. Xu Jing told him to rest for another half day and not to work. In the afternoon, he couldn't hold back any longer and sat up. Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei came to visit again. Wu Sangui also ordered officials to send a lot of food. Liu Yining thanked them and accepted it. Everyone sat and talked until dusk. Xu Jing told the soldiers to buy wine, and the four of them sat around the Xuantan Temple for a drink. Liu Yining shared the food sent by Wu Sangui with the other three. Everyone was encouraged and delighted because of the victory. Zhang Cangqiu was especially drunk. After getting drunk, he sang "The Great River Flows Eastward" in a passionate voice. They drank until late at night before Chen Fei helped Zhang Cangqiu leave. The next day, Liu Yining got up early in the morning, and his wound had healed. Wu Sangui had also ordered the army to set off, with Ma Bao and Bai Xianzhong's armies still as the vanguard. Although there were small groups of bandits resisting along the way, as soon as they made contact, they were like crushing dry weeds, and they were invincible in every battle. The bandits who invaded outside the pass were also defeated by the Qing army, and then they drove straight to the capital. After Li Zicheng was defeated, he fled back to Yanjing, still wanting to resist, but the morale of the army had wavered. Except for Liu Zong who was willing to fight to the death, the rest of the bandit generals advocated retreating to Shaanxi. Niu Jinxing couldn't make up his mind for a while. (236)
