### Soviet and Turkish Joint Declaration Released: Firmly Guaranteeing Non-Aggression - Turkey Determined to Fully Defend its Territory - This Soviet Action Relieves Turkey's Concerns about its Eastern Border

Ankara: The Soviet Union has sent a note to Turkey stating that if Turkey is attacked by a foreign country and goes to war to defend its borders, it can rely on Moscow's full understanding and neutrality. If the Soviet Union is invaded by a foreign country, Turkey must also adopt the same attitude. This news has been announced simultaneously by the governments of the two countries in a public statement. (Reuters, 25th)

Istanbul, Turkey: The Soviet Union and Turkey issued a joint declaration last night. In addition to a preface emphasizing that the Soviet Union has no intention of attacking Turkey if it is invaded by another country, the declaration contains several articles. The first and second articles state that the Soviet government provides Turkey with a guarantee that if Turkish territory is invaded, the Soviet Union will adopt a neutral and understanding attitude. The third and fourth articles stipulate that Turkey will adopt the same attitude towards the Soviet Union. This joint declaration, written in both Russian and Turkish, was issued simultaneously in Moscow and Ankara. According to political figures, the decision for the two countries to hold talks and agree on the issuance of a joint declaration was initiated by the Soviet Union. (Havas, 15th)

Istanbul: Just before Yugoslavia was to sign a non-aggression pact with the Axis powers, it was announced here this morning that the Soviet Union has formally guaranteed that Turkey can boldly resist a possible German attack to defend its territory, including the Dardanelles. During an important exchange of notes between the two countries, the Soviet Union notified Turkey that if Turkey is forced to fight, it can "trust the Soviet Union's complete understanding." Diplomatic circles say that this statement will have a profound impact on Chancellor Hitler's Balkan plan. Judging by the tone, the Soviet Union has indeed promised Turkey that in the event of a German attack on the Dardanelles, the Soviet Union will privately supply Turkey with weapons, etc. According to the Turkish press, Turkey may not seek military cooperation with Britain, which is consistent with the Soviet Union's statement. (International, 25th)

Istanbul: The Deputy Speaker of the Turkish National Assembly, Mr. Kunakci, made an extraordinary statement on Sunday, saying that Turkey's foreign policy aims to maintain peace and that Turkey has no territorial demands. If peace in the Near East is broken, Turkey is determined to protect its security to the last person. Observers note that Mr. Kunakci's statement did not mention the Balkans at all. (Haitong, 25th)

Ankara: People here believe that the Soviet Union's guarantee to Turkey has restored the atmosphere of mutual understanding that existed before the Soviet-Finnish War and has largely dispelled the threat felt by Turkey's eastern border. The Soviet-Turkish declaration also deals a fatal blow to German propagandists in Turkey, who had been spreading rumors that if Turkey joined the war, the Soviet Union would attack it from behind. Turkish sources also believe that because Germany is economically dependent on the Soviet Union, Moscow's attitude has a very significant impact on Germany. (Reuters, 25th)

Istanbul: It is reported here that air defense exercises will be held in Istanbul and on the "Princes' Islands" in the Straits. At the same time, the "Parachute Search and Strike Team," a militia organization, will also hold exercises. (Haitong, 25th)

### Britain and Turkey Jointly Defend the Gateway to the Black Sea - Actually Gaining Tacit Approval from the Soviet Union

Chongqing: Today's editorial in the "Ta Kung Pao," entitled "The European War Situation and Soviet-Turkish Relations," states that Hitler's spring offensive has almost begun, and the Balkans will inevitably become one of the main battlefields, with the Anglo-Greek allied forces confronting Germany. Greece is Britain's only stronghold on the European continent, so it must be contested and defended. At the same time, North Africa is nearing complete clearance, so the situation in the Mediterranean is more favorable to Britain. As for the Near East, Soviet-Turkish relations have now made progress. It is reported that the Soviet Union and Turkey will issue a joint declaration, with the Soviet Union encouraging Turkey to defend the Dardanelles and the two straits without worrying about its rear. This move gives Turkey and the Anglo-Turkish alliance great reassurance and is tantamount to the Soviet Union tacitly approving Britain and Turkey jointly guarding the gateway to the Black Sea, allowing Iraq, Iran, and other places to achieve stability. This is undoubtedly beneficial to Britain. From this move, one can also see the Soviet Union's vigilance towards the Axis powers. Therefore, it can be inferred that Mr. Matsuoka's meeting with Mr. Molotov will not yield any results. (Havas, 24th)

### Greece Fights Valiantly for Independence - Turkish Authorities Express Admiration

Athens: On the 120th anniversary of Greek independence, Turkish leaders and the King of Greece sent congratulatory messages to the Greek army. King George II of Greece said in a letter to the Commander-in-Chief of the Greek Army, Mr. Papagos, "Greece will celebrate one of the greatest days in its history. We sincerely admire those who shed blood to defend the legacy of their ancestors." Prime Minister Korizis said to the army, "The fate of Greece is in your hands. The whole country expresses its gratitude to you." Turkish President Ismet, Prime Minister Sedam, and Foreign Minister Salajoglu also sent congratulatory messages, expressing Turkish solidarity with Greece and praising the bravery of the Greek army. President Ismet said, "I am filled with admiration for the

### Japan Plans to Strengthen Diplomatic Corps - Opens Diplomatic Training Class

Tokyo: The "Asahi Shimbun" announced yesterday that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will open a six-month training class in April to train capable diplomatic personnel. The report said that the training has two main objectives: one is moral and technical training, and the other is to emphasize national self-awareness because diplomatic personnel often neglect this necessary qualification. The training curriculum includes diplomatic etiquette, counter-espionage, and other required courses for Japanese diplomats, as well as instruction in swordsmanship, judo, and meditation. (Associated Press, 25th)

resistance and bravery displayed by the Greeks in their war for independence." Prime Minister Sedam said, "I express my deep respect for the bravery and perseverance in the cause of freedom." The Turkish Foreign Minister said, "I extend my deepest feelings to the heroic army that has created a new page of glory. (Associated Press, 25th)

### Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov Receives Yosuke Matsuoka - Stalin Also Participates in Talks - Matsuoka Leaves Soviet Union for Berlin Yesterday

Moscow: On the afternoon of March 24, Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, Stalin, and Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Tatekawa, were present. The talks lasted for over an hour. (TASS, 25th)

Moscow: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka left here for Berlin at 11:05 last night. Those seeing him off at the station included Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Lozovsky; Director of the Treaty Department of the Foreign Commissariat, Mr. Barkov; Director of the Second Far Eastern Department of the Foreign Commissariat, Mr. Chalapkin; Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa; German Ambassador Schulenburg; Italian Ambassador Rosso; and the Ministers of Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. (TASS, 25th)

Switzerland: The Geneva Daily News recently published a special dispatch from Berlin stating that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka is expected to arrive in Berlin tomorrow. Germany is preparing to give him a grand welcome. Many workers are erecting white wooden poles at the military station and in the embassy district to hang the flags of Germany and Japan. It is heard that Matsuoka plans to stay in Berlin for ten days. (Havas, 25th)

Moscow: Observers here recently said that it is noteworthy that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka held a meeting with Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov shortly after arriving in Moscow yesterday. Furthermore, Stalin was also present. It is unprecedented for Stalin to personally participate in diplomatic negotiations; he usually only does so when the two countries have already reached a principled agreement on the formation of an agreement. Now that Matsuoka has just arrived in Moscow and met with Stalin, its significance is quite significant. As far as the general public knows, political negotiations between Matsuoka and the Soviet authorities will be held after Matsuoka's visits to Berlin and Rome. However, it is also a fact that relations between Japan and the Soviet Union have recently improved. It is believed that when the Japan-Soviet Joint Fisheries Committee was established on January 20 of this year, observers stated that Japan-Soviet relations had entered a new era and that the time for mutual rapprochement had matured. (Havas, 25th)

### Japan Attaches Importance

Tokyo: Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told foreign reporters today that Foreign Minister Matsuoka is expected to arrive in Berlin tomorrow and plans to stay for four days. On March 31, he plans to leave for Rome and stay for three days. When asked where he will go after visiting Rome, Ishii replied that he does not yet know where he will stay on his way back. Ishii also answered a question about rumors that Matsuoka might go to London after Rome, saying, "If he wishes, he may be able to do so." Ishii then laughed and said, "I hope his plane will not be bombed when he flies over London." He then talked about Matsuoka's activities in Moscow, saying that although he knew the process of Matsuoka's activities there, the government had not yet received information about the nature of Matsuoka's meeting with Molotov and Stalin on Sunday. (Reuters, 25th)

Generally, people expected Matsuoka to meet with Molotov when he went to Berlin or on his way back, but few expected him to meet with Stalin. According to Japanese sources, diplomatic observers believe that Matsuoka's meeting with Stalin is very important because Stalin rarely meets with foreign politicians or diplomatic representatives. Only last October, when Foreign Minister Ribbentrop went to Moscow to sign the Soviet-German economic agreement, did Stalin meet him once. As for Japanese politicians who have been formally received by Stalin, there was only one person, Mr. Kuhara, the Minister of Communications in the Tanaka Cabinet in 1928. Even if Matsuoka's meeting with Stalin is a formality, it will still have a significant impact on the adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations. Evening newspapers all reported in large print that the sincerity of Matsuoka's meeting with Stalin was of great significance and said that Matsuoka was the first Japanese person to be formally received by the Soviet dictator. The "Asahi Shimbun" said that even if this meeting was purely social in nature, it still deserves close attention from the international community. The report also quoted Matsuoka's remarks after the meeting with Stalin: "The possibility and inevitability of friendly relations with the Soviet Union has been a belief held for ten years. I am taking this opportunity to express my opinion on this matter." (Reuters, 20th)

### Matsuoka's Busy Social Schedule in Moscow - Presents Artistic Treasures to Stalin and Others

Moscow: After dining with German Ambassador Schulenburg at the German Embassy here yesterday, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, accompanied by Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Tatekawa, visited Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov. Stalin and Deputy Foreign Commissar Lozovsky were also present during the meeting. Matsuoka also hosted a reception at the Japanese Ambassador's residence for diplomats from the Axis countries. After arriving here, Matsuoka entrusted the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send gifts to Stalin and Molotov. The gift to Stalin was a 18th-century Japanese screen carved with landscape paintings, and the gift to Molotov was a lacquered box with a gold and silver carving of a Japanese shrine. (Reuters, 15th)

Moscow: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka paid a courtesy visit to Mr. Molotov yesterday afternoon and visited British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Cripps and French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Labonne. (Haitong, 15th)

### Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam Meet in Laos - Resolve Border Disputes - Vietnam Denies Providing Laos Base to Japan - Japanese Aircraft from Thailand to be Returned

Saigon: Today, 100 French military officers, 1,100 native soldiers and workers arrived here aboard the French ship Iledam. At the same time, French, Japanese, and Thai officials, led by the Japanese military representative and Shanghai Japanese military spokesman, Mr. Fujii, gathered in Stung Treng on the southern border of Laos to discuss the settlement of the French-Thai border dispute. Authoritative sources here believe the news from Shanghai that the Japanese have obtained military bases in Laos near the Burmese border to bomb the Yunnan-Burma Road. They point to the fact that Japan has 100 aircraft in Thailand, which were lent to Thailand during the French-Thai conflict. Authoritative sources say that since Thailand no longer needs these aircraft, Japan will use them to deal with South China. Reliable sources say that Japan has already obtained an air base in northern Thailand. However, French officials say that since the agreement of September 1940, Japan has not obtained any further military advantages in Vietnam. The Rabradoramaru set sail for Japan today carrying 6,000 tons of rubber. (Associated Press, 25th)

### Commander-in-Chief of Soviet Far Eastern Army Replaced

Berlin: The German official news agency Moscow reports that General Apanasenko has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Far Eastern Front. Apanasenko was previously the Commander-in-Chief of the Central Asian Military District and was promoted to general only a month ago. The previous Commander-in-Chief of the Far Eastern Front was General Stern, who was known as a hero of the Soviet Union for his meritorious service in dealing with Japan. (Reuters, 25th)

Editorial

### The Tripartite Talks and the Soviet Union and Japan

If the Japanese Foreign Minister had visited Germany and Italy before last September, the international sensation it would have caused would have been many times greater than this current trip. At present, the international camps have already been clearly divided. When allies visit each other, the scope of their activities is limited to the methods and extent of cooperation. This does not produce any new significance in international politics. Moreover, the facts show that Japan's national strength has been weakened in the Sino-Japanese War, and the panic it has shown recently under pressure from Britain and the United States has reduced its international elasticity. Therefore, although the world does not ignore the possible gains of the tripartite talks themselves, the attitude and reaction of the Soviet Union towards them are more worthy of attention. The day before yesterday, Mr. Matsuoka said in Moscow that this trip would have a decisive effect on world peace or war. Whether this is Matsuoka's boast or just exaggeration, the reliance on the attitude of the Soviet Union certainly accounts for a very heavy share.

Japan's hopes for the Soviet Union were originally very obvious. Apart from the imagined cessation of Soviet aid to China, which Japan has probably realized is hopeless, it is only trying to conclude a so-called non-aggression pact, like the Soviet-German relationship, or to request the exchange and supply of materials and the convenience of transportation. From the perspective of the overall international situation, the key to this problem lies in whether and how Japan will advance south and invade Britain and the United States. In other words, if Soviet-Japanese relations are not adjusted, Japan can only continue to submit to the pressure from Britain and the United States. If it is said that it will fight bravely, it will only be possible if Germany takes the lead and defeats Britain completely. If the Soviet Union, under pressure from its relations with Germany, actually accepts Japan's demands, then Japan will of course be able to flaunt a victorious posture in diplomacy and slightly ease its worries about its northern border in military strategy. However, the advantage of Britain and the United States will still exist, that is, the possibility of Japan's southward advance and a head-on conflict with Britain and the United States will still not increase. The only difference is that it may hope that Britain and the United States will no longer intensify their pressure. Although we do not need to hastily say that Japan may receive the opposite reaction, that is, Britain and the United States may intensify their pressure, up to this point, it will not actually have any impact on the international situation, that is, it will not help Japan's plight. Further assuming that Soviet-Japanese relations are actually adjusted, and that in addition to compromise, there is also a tacit understanding or secret agreement for Japan's southward advance and a head-on conflict with Britain and the United States, then the Soviet Union will of course still adhere to its policy of staying out of the whirlpool, making the world war outside the Soviet Union expand and lengthen even further. However, this assumption has another premise, that is, the Soviet Union is either preparing to sacrifice Germany, Italy, and Japan, or it has the determination and plan to compete with Germany, Italy, and Japan independently. The possibility of this premise being established will certainly not exceed 50%. We believe that this estimate is well-founded. Furthermore, the joint statement issued by the Soviet Union and Turkey yesterday further shows that although the Soviet Union may not have any discrimination in its basic understanding of the two fronts of aggression and self-defense, the difference in interests and trends has a further choice.

Looking at it from another perspective, in Japan's attempt to adjust its relations with the Soviet Union, we must also pay attention to the role played by its allies Germany and Italy here. The key to Japan's attempt to improve relations with the Soviet Union through Germany and Italy is that Japan is willing to fully accept Germany and Italy's demands and immediately respond to them in the East by launching military operations against Britain and the United States. Before leaving and after arriving in Moscow, Mr. Matsuoka repeatedly expressed his desire to see the European war situation on the ground. The implication is very important. It can be inferred that he means that he still needs to observe the possibility of Germany and Italy winning in order to decide his own countermeasures. He also vaguely expressed his so-called "peace" wish, which can be regarded as Japan's original lack of sincerity towards the German-Italian alliance, so before arriving in Berlin, he foreshadowed a retreat. Because Japan has already lost its qualifications to mediate the European war, its remaining possibilities are either to cooperate with Germany and Italy in actual action and participate in the war, or to change its international policy under a cabinet collapse at home. Mr. Matsuoka's trip has made it impossible for Japan to hesitate. This is what we are happy to pay attention to in Mr. Matsuoka's trip.

### Bloody Battles on the South Bank of the Kan River in Jiangxi - Chinese Troops on the Eastern Route Capture Duku City - Fierce Fighting West of Gao'an - All Important Strongholds Recovered

Zhangshu: Tens of thousands of Japanese troops in northern Jiangxi have been successively increased.

New York: A New York Times correspondent in the Yugoslav capital reported that the German agreement to be signed in Vienna today is very different from those signed by Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. Its content will not include military clauses, nor will it stipulate the demobilization of Yugoslav troops. Most of the clauses will be economic, but they will allow Germany to use Yugoslav railways for hospital and military train traffic. (Reuter's dispatch from the 25th)

Vienna: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop gave a speech today, welcoming Yugoslavia's participation in the Tripartite Alliance. Ribbentrop said, "I, as the representative of the German government, and in the name of the representatives of the seven countries of Germany, Italy, Japan, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and Bulgaria, welcome our friendly country Yugoslavia to participate in the Tripartite Alliance." He also said, "Yugoslavia's participation in the Tripartite Alliance has special significance. First, all the formerly neutral Balkan countries have now fully joined the front line of building a new order. Second, the countries that Britain still believes can interfere in their internal affairs and listen to their commands to oppose the plan to reorganize Europe have now resolutely joined the Axis group." (Haitong dispatch from the 25th)

Vienna: Yugoslav Prime Minister Svetozar Marković gave a speech here at the Belvedere Palace today after signing the protocol on Yugoslavia's accession to the Berlin Tripartite Pact. The gist of his speech was that Yugoslavia joined the Berlin Tripartite Pact for the sake of its own interests, to avoid the extension of the war to Southeastern Europe, and to strengthen cooperation among the countries of the continent. The main objective of Yugoslav foreign policy remains to maintain the peace and security of the Yugoslav nation and to cultivate friendly relations with neighboring countries.

### Britain Issues Note to Yugoslav Government, Expressing Serious Warning

Cairo: The British note delivered to the Yugoslav government by the British Minister to Yugoslavia yesterday was a final appeal and warning, reiterating the British position and requesting that Yugoslavia, disregarding the aroused public opinion, abandon its previous attitude. British officials in Cairo stated that the British government has repeatedly clarified that if Yugoslavia follows the example of Romania and Bulgaria, it will bring fatal harm upon itself, and that any agreement that Yugoslavia signs that is bound to throw it into the arms of Germany and Italy cannot be tolerated under any circumstances. Recent reports from Yugoslavia show that the entire Yugoslav people, including the Croats, oppose signing any agreement with Germany, and their sentiments are becoming increasingly firm, especially in the army, as they all understand that such an agreement violates the true interests of Yugoslavia. British officials also stated that Yugoslavia has only two choices, either to quickly act in concert with Britain, Greece, and Turkey, or to suffer the same fate as Vienna and Bulgaria. There is no doubt as to which path the Yugoslav people will choose. The British note was delivered to the Yugoslav government by British Minister Campbell yesterday morning. The new figures in the Yugoslav government are Nikitović, a former member of parliament, the current Minister of Agriculture, and Ikonić, the current Minister of Social Welfare, succeeding the Serbian cabinet members who opposed signing the agreement with the Axis countries and resigned. (Reuter's dispatch from the 25th)

London: The British side had already given up hope of reversing Yugoslavia's adherence to the Axis when the Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister arrived in Vienna this morning. They believe that only an armed coup, which may trigger a civil war, can prevent Yugoslavia from signing the agreement. It is said here that the Yugoslav military authorities are extremely pro-British, and four generals and three senior officers of the Yugoslav Royal Guard, who are extremists, have left the army and fled. The refugees have been continuously crossing into the Greek border. Minister of the Army Bišek finds this difficult to handle. Bišek did not participate in the vote when the Yugoslav cabinet decided to accept Hitler's request on Friday. British sources said that the public expressed opposition to this move, with hundreds of public rallies held throughout Yugoslavia, and countless leaflets were posted on the streets of Nanjing, threatening to assassinate cabinet members. (Associated Press dispatch from the 25th)

### German Troops Moving South in Bulgaria, Attack on Greece Imminent

London: The British Observer strongly believes today that Germany will attack Greece immediately after Yugoslavia signs the agreement to adhere to the Tripartite Pact, perhaps even beginning the attack on Greece's Independence Day today. Sources in the Balkans say that since Sunday, German troops in Bulgaria have been moving south to the Struma Valley, which is the only direct route from the western border of Bulgaria to Thessaloniki. (Associated Press dispatch from the 25th)

Yugoslav Capital: According to unconfirmed reports arriving here today, the German and Yugoslav armies have clashed several times near the Bulgarian border. Although details are unknown, it is said that the clashes occurred on Monday night, just before the Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister left the capital. At the same time, it was heard that British Minister to Yugoslavia Campbell convened a special meeting of all embassy staff to discuss "important steps." It is expected that the discussion is related to the possibility of a break in relations between Britain and Yugoslavia. (International Society dispatch from the 25th)

### Yugoslavia's Isolated Position, No Surprise That It Adheres to Germany

Vichy: Diplomatic observers here are not surprised by Yugoslavia's decision to join the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. It is generally believed that since Bulgaria joined the alliance on March 1st, the Yugoslav government was bound to follow suit. The policy pursued by Yugoslavia has always been "dominated by Slavic thought." In other words, even though Serbia and Bulgaria fought in opposing camps during the last World War, after the war, neither side wanted to establish a barrier between the two countries. Therefore, Yugoslavia did not demand reparations from Bulgaria at that time. When Yugoslavia signed the Balkan Entente with Greece, Turkey, and Romania on February 9, 1934, this policy seemed to have been abandoned, but in practice, this was not entirely the case. When these countries were negotiating and agreeing on this entente, Yugoslavia insisted that this entente should be directed against "any future enemy." Greece insisted that the four countries should only defend the current borders of the Balkan Peninsula. Therefore, the Balkan Entente ultimately became a treaty solely against Bulgaria. Later, to show that Yugoslavia had no hostility towards Bulgaria, it signed a treaty of "permanent friendship" with it. For this reason, after Bulgaria joined the Tripartite Alliance on March 1st, it was generally believed that Yugoslavia would follow suit. However, the evolution of international politics could not prevent the "Old Serbia" party and public opinion from opposing the country's accession to the alliance. Therefore, the Yugoslav government had to ask Germany to amend the provisions of the protocol so that Yugoslavia would not be subject to any military constraints. However, after Yugoslavia joins the alliance, it will inevitably lose its alliance relationship with Greece and Britain, without a doubt. In addition, since the establishment of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance treaty on September 27, 1940, other countries have joined one after another. Hungary joined first on November 20th last year, followed by Romania and the Slovak state on November 23rd last year, and Bulgaria joined on the 1st of this month. Yugoslavia's accession to the alliance is the eighth country to do so. (Havas dispatch from the 25th)

(Associated Press dispatch from the 25th)

Yugoslav Capital: The military and police here are taking emergency measures. Threats of assassinating traitors fill the streets of the capital. The people of Serbia and Montenegro are furious and want to take action. Therefore, the situation of internal unrest may become even more serious. Deputy Prime Minister Maček will assume the responsibilities of the Prime Minister before the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister return, and will instruct the measures to be taken by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (International News dispatch from the 25th)

### Former U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Advocates Massive U.S. Aid to China. China is the Outer Defense Line of the United States. The U.S. Must Have a Resolute Far East Policy.

Washington: Former U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, McNutt, former U.S. Governor-General of the Philippines, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, and renowned journalist Smith, among other Far East experts, recently held a debate on U.S. Far East policy on the radio. All three of the above advocated that the United States give China the maximum assistance. Mr. Mac believed that the history of the United States is a history of striving to expand its borders, setting distant destinations to be reached and great demands to be achieved. The borders that we have repeatedly expanded have become milestones for the United States to move forward. The argument made by people at the time to fortify the Philippine Islands was to prevent these places from being acquired by others and used to resist the United States, just as the United States previously obtained these lands that constituted spoils of war from Spain by force and by purchasing them for $20 million. In order to maintain our position as a strong power in Asia, a large and powerful fleet has already been transferred from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Recently, the government has also declared that a fleet train (that is, a small fleet used to supply the warships) has greatly increased its size so that the U.S. fleet can operate in Philippine territorial waters. In addition, there are countless other indications that the United States is engaged in protecting its Eastern interests. All these indications are caused by the repeated warnings made by our neighboring country, Japan. Last autumn, Japan formed a ten-year economic and political agreement with Germany and Italy. When Japan concluded this agreement, it also stated that if it were to become involved in the current war to help Britain, the Japanese fleet would also wage war with the United States to determine the balance of power in the Pacific. In December, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke, a graduate of the University of Oregon, reiterated his warning, emphasizing that the result of the U.S.-Japan war would be the final battle between good and evil at the end of the world and would completely destroy American culture. Matsuoka understands the American people. He is fully aware of the techniques of propaganda (terrorist tactics). Matsuoka should know that the United States constantly thinks of maintaining friendly relations with Japan based on fundamental principles and good policies. The desire of the United States to maintain friendship with Japan is no different from the desire of the United States to maintain friendship with the countries of the Far East, Latin America, Europe, and the world. Matsuoka has certainly recognized that it is now increasingly difficult for the United States to maintain this relationship with the militaristic government in Tokyo. However, the Japanese Foreign Minister also knows that in fact, there are some Americans who have, in recent years, and especially in recent months, constantly advocated that the United States change its policies, often saying that the United States has forgotten its original principles and that the United States has abandoned certain possessions, such as the Philippines, and certain objectives in the past, in order to appease Japan. However, the remarks made by this Japanese who was educated in the United States are intended to instill these remarks into the ears of those who advocate isolation in the Western Hemisphere, even if Japan threatens, the United States still does not believe that there is a need to go to war with Japan. This kind of optimism is due to the success of China's struggle for survival. As far as the United States is concerned, the Sino-Japanese War has now become a war in the nature of the outer defense line of the Philippine Islands. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese War and our hope for peace have become inseparable. Therefore, the United States giving China full economic assistance is actually strengthening our country's outer defense line. We still remember that in the previous six years, the United States has shipped more than 8 million tons of scrap iron to Japan, and Japan has built warships of nearly 500,000 tons in recent years. This simple fact, in reference to the situation in the East under Nazi domination, and the situation of one of the richest countries on the world's continents, a country that is only now beginning to realize the danger it faces, the only civilized world that maintains democracy, a large part of it, can show that the United States must establish a strong policy in the Far East. (Associated Press dispatch from the 25th)

### Britain Can Borrow Money If Necessary to Aid Chinese Stabilization Fund. Does Not Support Black Market to Avoid Being Exploited. Legal Tender Status Will Be Further Strengthened.

London: No official news regarding the status of the Chinese Stabilization Fund has been released here. However, it is generally believed that Britain is naturally willing to guarantee any British pound loan to aid this stabilization fund, so as to prevent it from being exploited by those who force Nanjing banknotes on Shanghai or other improper absorption. It is heard that if satisfactory guarantees on this point are obtained, then the British pound loan to this stabilization fund can definitely be realized. According to the opinion of the London Far East banking community, in any case, the main task of supporting China's legal tender is now undertaken by the United States, as its 100 million yuan loan can greatly strengthen China's legal tender to prevent Nanjing or Tokyo from sabotaging it. Londoners believe that the Chinese Stabilization Fund, with this U.S. loan, can easily maintain or restore the value of Chinese legal tender when it deems appropriate. According to last week, London pointed out that the recent weakness of Chinese legal tender was due to the stabilization fund's unwillingness to support the Shanghai black market, and not its lack of strength to support it. It is also rumored that negotiations are underway to prevent British pound loans to strengthen the stabilization fund from being used to support the Shanghai black market, as the Shanghai black market is a major loophole in the British exchange control.

### Bethlehem Factory: Workers' Riot

Bethlehem, This morning a riot broke out here. The Industrial Organizations Congress steelworkers have gone on strike, causing the massive factory of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation to halt production. The emergency national defense orders being handled by the factory are valued at US$1,500,000,000. Due to the strike at the Bethlehem factory, two other steel companies have also been forced to cease production. The strike at the Midland Steel Company factory in Detroit has not seriously affected national defense orders, but only the automotive industry. The Steel Workers Organizing Committee has caused a strike at the main factory of the Bethlehem Company, threatening the cessation of major national defense contract work. There are 2,000 workers at the Bethlehem factory. The strike is retaliation against the election personnel of a certain trade union. As a riot broke out here this morning, the mayor of Bethlehem has ordered motorcycle police from 40 states to maintain order around the factory. The initial incident that triggered the riot occurred shortly after midnight when a car carrying three people exited the gate of the Bethlehem factory and was overturned by steelworker pickets. Two people of unknown nationality attempted to set fire to the overturned car with burning paper, but a large contingent of police rushed to the scene and drove the workers away. Other workers also took action, blocking another gate with cars. It is reported that two cars were destroyed. It is reported that the confrontation between police and workers resulted in no deaths or injuries. The strike at the Midland Steel plant in Detroit has led to the closure of the Ford Motor Company's Lincoln plant. Two other factories with 52,000 workers are also in danger of closing due to the inability of the Midland plant to supply raw materials. Furthermore, the strike that occurred on March 12 in Edgewater, New Jersey, has already ended. Other Industrial Organizations Congress workers have voted to resume work, without further delaying national defense orders worth US$15 million. (United Press Dispatch, 25th)

### Britain Prepares for the Spring Offensive; Victory is Assured; Ten Key Factors

### British Air Force Bombs Berlin; Drops 10,000 Bombs; Berlin's Alde Station Destroyed

London, It was learned last night that British bombers dropped 10,000 incendiary bombs on Berlin on Sunday night. Polish airmen also participated in the raid. British aircraft attacked the central area of the German capital, having to pass through intense anti-aircraft fire. Although the Germans used heavy fire to protect the heart of Berlin, large numbers of British bombers still soared back and forth in the sky. Some British aircraft flew along the Linden Avenue (where there are five major railway stations within a mile of here) so that the bombs would hit their targets. Other British aircraft dropped more bombs into the flames caused by the first wave of British bombs. Still other British aircraft bombed warehouses and factories in the south of the city. Many of the airmen who attacked Berlin had attacked it repeatedly, so this decision was very effective. British aircraft dropped 10,000 incendiary bombs and several of the largest high-explosive bombs on Berlin. The bombs fell like rain, repeatedly hitting targets in the main targeted areas, causing constant explosions and fires everywhere, with red flames rising into the sky. On the way back from Berlin, several British aircraft passed over Hanover and attacked the city, seeing many bombs hit the central area and explode with a roar. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)

New York, The tempo of the European war is now accelerating. British aircraft heavily bombed the center of Berlin and Kiel on Sunday night. British forces are also building trenches for defense on the Greek-Yugoslavian border in northern Greece. The British bombing of Germany was the heaviest in a week, with a large number of aircraft and huge bombs. London believes that Berlin's Anhalter Bahnhof railway station has been destroyed, as the train carrying the Hungarian Foreign Minister was supposed to disembark at that station, but was later changed to Friedrichstraße station. The German headquarters sent fighter-protected aircraft to raid Malta, where thirteen were shot down. At least nine were shot down by British fighter aircraft, and four were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. The damage to Malta was slight. In Abyssinia, South African air force aircraft continued to support the British advance. Enemy road and rail traffic between Dire Dawa and Ayesha was also heavily bombed. A train carrying military supplies eastward to Dire Dawa at Urso was hit by multiple bombs. Trains, motor vehicles, and enemy troops in many other locations in Abyssinia were bombed and strafed. British pilots reported that when flying over Zeila in British Somaliland, they saw a large number of natives holding white flags and saw a British flag flying on a building. All but two of the British aircraft returned safely. The pilots of the two missing aircraft parachuted safely. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)

It is admitted that several people were killed or injured in Berlin, and there were also several fires. In Kiel, the bombs fell on residential areas. The British Air Force also bombed Hanover (Germany) and various German-occupied ports. British coastal defense aircraft swept the North Sea throughout the day, apparently searching for the German warships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, which have been raiding British ships in the Atlantic for several weeks. The German Air Force only carried out scattered attacks on Britain, largely due to bad weather. (Associated Press Dispatch, 25th)

London, There was little air activity over Britain yesterday. After dawn, enemy aircraft raided southwestern England and South Wales, but the material damage was slight and there were few casualties. One enemy aircraft was shot down by British fighters. There were no air raid alarms in Britain as of late last night. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)

Nairobi, It was announced here yesterday that the entire territory of British Somaliland is now in the hands of British forces, and the road from Babilah to Hargeisa has now been opened. British forces in Abyssinia continue to gain victories. The vanguard of the British army attacked the strong Italian positions defending the Marda Pass west of Jijiga. The Italians resisted stubbornly, but the British forces ultimately captured this extremely important position at a slight cost. The war is continuing, and the remote administrative center, 400 miles from the British lines of communication, is now being occupied by British forces transported by air, with political officers accompanying them to administer the area. Reports from Cairo indicate that Keren, a strong Italian stronghold in Eritrea, is now surrounded by British forces. The fighting in the mountains three or four miles from the city is very intense. A military spokesman stated last night that "the Italian forces there are currently putting up the most stubborn resistance in the African war." The Abyssinian capital, Addis Ababa, is now under threat from several British forces, with the threats from the south from the advance from Neghelli and from the east from the advance across Jijiga being the most serious.

### The Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks Decide to Uphold Overall Finance; Rumors of Withdrawals and Retreats are Untrue; Central and Farmers Banks Temporarily Suspend Business for Reorganization

Following the tragic incident at the Bai Saizhong Road dormitory of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank in the French Concession, and then the bombing of the Central Bank's offices on Avenue Albert and Rue Paul Beau, which resulted in multiple deaths and injuries, and the discovery of a bomb at the China Farmers Bank on Avenue Edward VII, which fortunately did not explode, people at home and abroad have expressed deep shock and hope that the Concession authorities will take concrete and necessary steps to prevent the recurrence of such incidents and to stabilize social order. According to information obtained yesterday, the following is known: (1) The Central Bank and the China Farmers Bank have temporarily suspended business operations from yesterday to handle the aftermath and discuss preventive measures. (2) Security measures at various banks in the city have been greatly enhanced, with Chinese and Western detectives, American defense forces, and the International Settlement Volunteers being dispatched to guard the entrances of various banks. (3) Rumors of the four banks about to retreat and withdrawal rushes occurring are malicious and unfounded rumors intended to confuse people, and have been denied by relevant parties. Details are as follows:

Central and Farmers Banks Close for Several Days

Yesterday, the Central Bank's offices on Avenue Albert and Rue Paul Beau were severely damaged by the bombing, and everything was awaiting reorganization and arrangement. Therefore, a notice was posted on the doors of both offices stating, "This bank was bombed yesterday, and repairs are needed. Business operations are temporarily suspended from today." As for the China Farmers Bank, because it also received a bomb the day before, fortunately, it did not explode. The bank employees were apprehensive, and the bank also suspended business operations yesterday. Notices were posted at the bank's two offices at 948 Avenue Edward VII and 607 Avenue Joffre, stating, "Notice: This bank received a bomb yesterday, which fortunately did not explode, causing all employees to be wary. Unable to come to the office today, we have had to temporarily suspend business. Notice." It is understood that the temporary suspension of business by the Central and Farmers Banks is purely a necessary step taken to reorganize and arrange the internal affairs, and there is nothing to be surprised about. It is said that the Central Bank may resume operations on Friday, and the Farmers Bank may also resume business within one or two days. As for the China and Communications Banks, their various offices are operating as usual.

Black Market Foreign Exchange to Be Maintained

The Shanghai financial market has been affected by the bombing of the Central Bank, and speculators have taken the opportunity to become active, spreading unfounded rumors, causing the black market foreign exchange to shrink and gold to rise sharply. However, according to investigations, the fluctuations in the Shanghai black market are entirely caused by speculators and have nothing to do with the overall financial situation. The overall financial situation remains stable as always. Although the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank temporarily suspended operations yesterday and did not post the official exchange rate or the equalization tax, the black market foreign exchange was still relatively stable. Rumors that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has ceased to maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate are purely fabricated. According to observations in general financial circles, the Central Bank is determined to maintain foreign exchange in Shanghai.

Rumors of Retreats Absolutely Unfounded

Yesterday, it was widely rumored in the city that "the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks are experiencing difficulties in their operations due to the bombings, and depositors have been withdrawing and retreating from these banks." According to inquiries made separately with the four banks last night, it was said that the persons in charge of the banks held an informal meeting the night before and unanimously agreed that the financial stability of Shanghai depended on the maintenance of these banks, and they decided to operate as usual to maintain the overall financial situation of Shanghai. All kinds of rumors are purely unfounded. Regarding the issue of withdrawals, it is entirely fabricated. Reporters also inquired with banking circles and received the same answers. Therefore, it is confirmed that the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks will not retreat or experience unfortunate events such as withdrawal rushes at present.

Authorities Adopt Strict Security Measures

In order to maintain order in the concessions and normal order in view of the unfortunate incidents that have occurred continuously within four days, the authorities of the two concessions have taken necessary and strict security measures starting yesterday. Various branches and offices of the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks have been given special protection by a large number of Chinese and Western detectives dispatched by the police. In addition, the White Russian Auxiliary Team of the International Settlement Volunteers, armed with guns, guarded the entrances of various banks, working with the detectives to strengthen security. The entrances of various branches and offices of the China and Communications Banks were searched when necessary for customers and employees entering and exiting. The French Concession also dispatched Chinese and Vietnamese detectives to take the same security measures at the entrances of various banks on Avenue Joffre and other streets to ensure safety. The US Marines' Fourth Regiment has been dispatched to patrol the streets in small teams of two or more men in their assigned areas to assist the police authorities in maintaining security. In addition, armed Chinese and Western detectives are conducting strict inspections of suspicious pedestrians and vehicles at various important intersections and bridges.

Repairs Underway at Bombed Sites

Reporters from the Great China News Agency inspected the bombed site of the Central Bank office on Rue Paul Beau yesterday and saw a large number of workers carrying out repairs inside. Seven of those injured at the Central Bank are still being treated at Paulun Hospital, including one person named He Jishi, who is more seriously injured, while the others are not in danger of their lives. More than ten police officers were stationed at the Central Bank branch at 439 Avenue Albert in the French Concession yesterday, strictly prohibiting outsiders from entering. The 128 people arrested from the Central Bank's villas and the two people arrested from the Communications Bank's dormitory are still being held in custody. Family members can now send bedding, clothing, and other necessities. Business is operating as usual at the Central Bank's various offices. Public services are not being delayed due to a shortage of personnel.

### American Hua Mei Radio Station Threatened Again; Openly Wanting to Put Hailey and Others to Death; Alcott Chased Twice

According to the well-known radio reporter Alcott, he and the station manager Hailey each received a threatening letter the day before yesterday, sent by a self-proclaimed Italian Fascist group in the city. One letter stated, "The sender is determined to put you two to death, but we have not yet decided what method to use to cause you to die." Another letter stated that Hailey and Alcott would be bombed today (the 25th). Hailey also received a threatening phone call this Monday (the 24th), with the caller speaking fluent English and telling Hailey that he intended to kill Hailey and Alcott. Hailey replied to the anonymous caller at the time, "I will wait in the office for your esteemed arrival." Alcott also said that when he was returning home from the radio station one day, a foreigner in a car followed his car closely. Recently, when he was returning home from a mainland newspaper office, a similar car also followed his car.

### Two Thieves Break Into Building, One Captured

Yesterday morning at 6:45 AM, two thieves attempted to pry open the gate of Hua Mei Broadcasting Station (XNHA) at 445 Race Course Road to steal items. At that time, they were seen by the patrol police, who immediately went forward to arrest them. Seeing that the situation was not good, the two immediately fled. The police then fired shots, and one of them, named Cui Xiuchun (37 years old, from Anhui), was shot in the leg and back and fell to the ground on the spot. The other one escaped. The injured person was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment, and it is said that his injuries are quite dangerous and he is not conscious. According to the police, neither of them had any weapons on them, so their purpose may have been only to steal the lock on the door of the house. Rumors that someone went to assassinate them there yesterday may be a misinterpretation.

### Over Ten Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive Yesterday; Hoarders Dump Their Stock

Yesterday's rice market saw hoarders dumping their stock due to the continued arrival of large quantities of foreign rice in Shanghai and the drop in gold prices. The secret prices of foreign rice at various dealers fell by two or three yuan per shih, but were still more than twenty yuan per shih higher than the price limit set by the Appraisal Association on February 3. However, because the city's inventory is extremely abundant and the sources are very plentiful, the price of rice is expected to continue to fall in the future. Yesterday, 75,000 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai on the French Navigation Company's "Grand Daran" ship from Gongzai, scheduled to arrive at Hongkou wharf at 8:30 AM today. The Dutch ship "Chipesa" transported over 28,000 bags, and over 20,000 bags were transshipped from Hong Kong. It is estimated that 123,000 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday.

Strict Weights and Measures

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has added a new clause to Article 7 of Rule No. 3 of the Food Products Licenses for the purpose of crackdown, the original text of the clause is as follows: "All weights and measures shall be checked regularly, and any that are found to be inaccurate shall be confiscated immediately. Licensees or any vendors who possess inaccurate weights and measures, or store, sell, or display for sale, or sell items that are underweight, shall be prosecuted."

Price-Controlled Rice Sales Suspended

The Price-Controlled Rice Sales Association held a meeting yesterday and decided to distribute the remaining 20,000 bags of rice at a fair price to various charitable organizations to run soup kitchens. It is said that price-controlled rice sales have been suspended due to various difficulties.

### Moufu Wheel Demands Release; German Consulate's Negotiations Ineffective

The German merchant ship "Moufu Wheel" of the Lihuo Foreign Firm, sailed from Shanghai to Fuqing, Fujian Province at the end of last month. However, it was obstructed by a Japanese warship in the Xinghua Bay and forced to sail to Zhoushan and placed under house arrest. It has been nearly a month since then. It is learned that although the German Consulate has negotiated several times, there has been no result. The Shanghai office is very anxious, so it has now once again requested the German Consulate to make a serious protest to the Japanese side in order to be released as soon as possible.

### French Electricity Workers' Strike Resolved; Traffic Expected to Resume This Morning; Arrested Workers Taken Away by Japanese Car Yesterday

Since the outbreak of the strike at the French Water and Electricity Company, it has dragged on for a week without a resolution. After the French police department of politics proposed three guarantees to the workers the day before yesterday, the strike showed a glimmer of hope. All the workers also went back to the factory one after another to prepare to resume work. Because the police did not release Ni Amao, the arrested coppersmith, a temporary change occurred, and the settlement of the strike became a thing of the past again. According to reports from the Pingming News Agency, the strike has been resolved. The company has agreed to increase the workers' rice allowance by 30 yuan per month and the subsidy by 30 yuan, totaling 60 yuan. The labor side has also expressed satisfaction with this plan. All the workers went back to the factory last night, and the trams and buses on the streets of the French Concession are expected to leave the factory at 5:30 AM this morning to resume operation. As for Ni Amao, the worker who was arrested due to the strike, he was taken away from the French police station yesterday by a Japanese car (special note No. 176). The temporary White Russian workers hired by the Water and Electricity Company will also be dismissed from today. This reporter asked the person in charge of the French police authorities yesterday, who also said that the labor-management conflict at the Water and Electricity Company is gradually approaching a resolution, and all issues should not be difficult to resolve. It is generally expected that traffic will be restored this morning.

### Mercenaries Loitering in Front of the Court Arrested by U.S. Defense Forces, Interrogated and Immediately Released on Haig Road, U.S. Military Reinforces Soldiers for Strict Protection

Yesterday at 9:00 AM, a bizarre and serious incident suddenly occurred at the First Special District Court's temporary office on Weihaiwei Road, creating a very tense situation. Three soldiers wearing military uniforms with army insignia on their arms were loitering in front of the court's entrance. Police officers and White Russian reserve troops guarding the court's entrance, finding their behavior suspicious, approached and advised them to leave, but to no avail. They then telephoned the U.S. Marines, responsible for the area's defense, who dispatched a large number of armed soldiers. Since the three soldiers were unarmed, the Marines immediately initiated surveillance while questioning them about their purpose. They claimed to have just arrived in Shanghai from Songjiang, but did not specify their purpose. Eventually, the U.S. military took the three men to their headquarters for interrogation, and then released them on the border of Haig Road. To prevent any further incidents, the Marines immediately stationed four armed soldiers each at the entrances of the First Special District Court's temporary office and the Second Branch Court's temporary office on Xinzha Road, along with Chinese and Western police officers and White Russian troops dispatched by the police station for strict security. They also dispatched dozens of soldiers, in pairs, to patrol Weihaiwei Road in sections to assist in maintaining order.

### U.S. Consulate Still Urges Citizens to Evacuate, Claims of Approved Returns to China Untrue

Reports in mainland newspapers claim that some Americans, including women, have now been granted permission by the U.S. State Department to come to China and other parts of the Orient. However, the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai has not received any such information and continues to urge non-essential citizens to evacuate. It is reported that the U.S. State Department has not relaxed its restrictions on approving Americans to come to the Far East.

### Labor-Management Election Negotiations, American Taxpayers Watch Closely, Foreigners Unanimously Oppose Changing the Status Quo, Appeasement Policies Inevitably Lead to Trouble

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* reports that the American taxpayers' election group in Shanghai held meetings last night (the 24th) and this afternoon (the 25th). It is expected that the American community will oppose the ongoing consultations between British and Japanese residents regarding a "gentleman's agreement" to increase the number of Japanese directors on the Shanghai Municipal Council.

Candidate American Directors Hold Talks

It is reported that American director candidates Allman and Minsde held talks at Allman's office this morning. A reporter asked Allman to comment on the American group's meeting last night, but Allman said he would not disclose any information at this time. This morning, the reporter tried to visit Minsde, chairman of the American Residents' Association, but was unable to reach him. According to other members of the American election committee, the American community's attitude towards the ongoing consultations between British and Japanese residents in Shanghai must be clarified by Minsde.

Unanimous Opposition to Increasing Japanese Directors

However, according to reliable sources, American taxpayers are opposed to increasing Japanese directors and the negotiations between British and Japanese residents. The consultations between British and Japanese residents have been going on for three weeks, and no formal announcement has been made regarding their progress. It is generally believed that British and Japanese residents are negotiating a "gentleman's agreement" regarding the next Municipal Council election, with the Japanese community hoping to increase the number of Japanese directors to at least three.

Japanese Aim to Control Administration

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* comments that it is claimed that relevant parties are currently negotiating to increase the number of Japanese directors on the Municipal Council. The question that arises upon hearing this report is: What is the Japanese aim? Is it merely to increase the number of directors, or is there a hidden agenda? If the Japanese aim is merely to increase the number of directors, then the issue is simple. However, it is widely believed that the Japanese aim is actually to control the entire administration of the Shanghai International Settlement's Municipal Council. The past actions of the Japanese in Shanghai and other parts of China have already made this clear. Foreigners in China today, witnessing this situation, naturally cannot sympathize with this Japanese attempt. If the ongoing negotiations result only in changing the existing five (British), two (American), two (Japanese) system to another ratio, such that the Japanese are still unable to control the Municipal Council, then it is expected that there will be less opposition. However, we must firmly state that if the status quo is changed merely to appease the Japanese, then it is feared that it will be difficult to prevent the Japanese from making other new demands.

### Greek Independence Day Celebrated Yesterday, Southern Overseas Chinese Participate

Mainland newspapers report that yesterday (the 25th) was the 120th anniversary of Greek independence. Greeks residing in Shanghai and around the world celebrated together. Because Greece is currently at war, the Greek community in Shanghai did not hold formal celebrations today. It is reported that the Greek Consulate General also cancelled its usual reception for the community this year. Last night (the 24th), a special commemorative service was held at the Greek Orthodox Church at 55 Henry Road. Many prominent members of the Greek community participated, such as Pan-Shanghai Greek Consul General Yannoulatos and his wife, and Vice Consul Jones. Many Yugoslavian residents in Shanghai also attended the church service, which was considered to be of great significance.

### Three Foreign Ships Retreating from Wuhan to Shanghai, Repairs Nearing Completion

After the Chinese army withdrew from Wuhan, two Dutch ships and one Portuguese ship, detained by the Japanese army outside Hankou, were released and set sail, arriving in Shanghai on the 17th of this month. The two Dutch ships were originally docked at the Swire company's pier in Pudong, and the Portuguese ship was moored at buoy number 89 in the South Huangpu River. The details were previously reported. It was previously learned that the two Dutch ships were moved to the Swire buoy last Friday and are currently under repair. The Jardine Matheson company, which manages the ships, has not yet decided which route they will take after the repairs are completed, pending instructions from the Dutch Consulate. The Portuguese ship is still moored at buoy number 89 and is also being painted.

### Restrictions on Tap Water Consumption to be Implemented Soon, Shanghai Municipal Council Considers and Responds, French Concession Awaits Decision After Meeting

The *Shanghai Times* reported yesterday (the 24th) that the Shanghai Municipal Council has considered the Shanghai Waterworks Company's application to restrict tap water consumption and has sent out a response. The implementation of tap water restrictions is now closer than ever. It is reported that the Public Works Committee of the French Concession's Municipal Council is scheduled to meet tonight (the 25th). It is expected that a specific plan to reduce tap water consumption will be formulated within a day or two after the meeting. However, the plan will not be announced until it is approved by the French Concession authorities, as the restriction of tap water is a matter of mutual concern for both concessions. An official from the Shanghai Waterworks Company recently confirmed the above information, but declined to specify the details of the proposed restrictions until the authorities of the two concessions have formally agreed. He only stated that there has been no major change in the company's coal reserves. The reason for the need to reduce tap water consumption in both concessions is the same as the reason for restricting electricity, namely the shortage of ships, which has led to a daily reduction in the amount of fuel being transported. As for the electricity situation, there has also been no change. The special committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council is still working on classifying the 85,000 electricity users in the International Settlement.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Total Budget Deficit for This Year Exceeds Two Million Yuan, Plans to Transfer 1.5 Million Yuan from Reserve Funds, Adding Surcharges Still Fails to Achieve Balanced Revenue and Expenditure

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office has released individual budgets for each department for this year, which have been reviewed and approved by the respective committees and published in the past. The Chief Financial Officer has now submitted the total budget for regular revenue and expenditure for this year to the Finance Committee for review at its regular meeting on the 17th of this month.

Overview of Revenue and Expenditure

According to the Chief Financial Officer's report, it is estimated that the deficit for this year after offsetting revenue and expenditure will be 2,921,100 yuan. The Chief Financial Officer pointed out that it was originally hoped that a balanced budget could be achieved this year after adding surcharges, but this was not possible due to the establishment of the Shanghai West Special Corps and the necessary adjustments to the salaries of the Russian Corps commanders.

Ordinary Revenue

The estimated amount of various regular revenue items for this year is 79,119,740 yuan, an increase of 37,257,990 yuan compared to last year. Specifically, land tax revenue is 19,450,000 yuan, house tax revenue is 35,737,000 yuan, and special house tax revenue is 2,988,000 yuan, totaling 58,175,000 yuan. Other items include special advertising tax revenue of 100,000 yuan, pier tax revenue of 625,000 yuan, various license fees revenue of 10,502,050 yuan, and rental income from council-owned properties of 1,050,000 yuan, totaling 79,119,740 yuan.

Ordinary Expenditure

Due to the sharp decline in the purchasing power of the national currency and the extreme increase in the prices of various necessities, the impact on the Council's expenditure is significant. The estimated amount of various regular expenses for this year is 74,927,960 yuan for ordinary expenses and 5,973,880 yuan for education expenses, totaling 80,901,840 yuan, an increase of 34,768,4880 yuan compared to last year. Among them, the Commercial Corps' expenses exceeded last year by 482,860 yuan, the Fire Department by 1,672,700 yuan, the Police Department by 19,558,890 yuan, the Health Department by 880,330 yuan, the Public Works Department by 5,070,390 yuan, the Music Team by 182,120 yuan, the Library by 47,800 yuan, the repayment of public debt by 800,000 yuan, and the Education Department by 2,710,910 yuan. The proposed subsidy for Chinese private schools this year is 605,000 yuan, and the subsidy for foreign schools is 495,000 yuan, maintaining the ratio of 55 to 45.

Temporary Revenue and Expenditure

(Temporary Expenditure) The deficit carried over from last year to this year is 2,003,570 yuan. The total amount required for emergency measures is approximately 800,000 yuan. The temporary expenditure for education is 145,000 yuan. The amount required for investment in staff pension funds is 750,000 yuan. In addition, the amount required for debt repayment and refunding fixed deposits totals 4,787,100 yuan. (Temporary Revenue) The expected revenue from the sale of real estate this year is 1,000,000 yuan. The revenue from issuing public bonds or other methods is tentatively set at 9,000,000 yuan. After offsetting revenue and expenditure, it is estimated that the deficit will be 183,130 yuan. The above temporary budgets have been approved by the Council's board meetings.

### Jewish Refugee Cemetery

The Shanghai Municipal Council has now approved a plot of land located on Zhoujiazui Road, measuring two and a half mu, to be used as a cemetery for impoverished Jewish residents. The management of the cemetery will be funded and managed by themselves.

### French Head of State Cables Thanks to French Residents for Donations

A Havas News Agency report from Shanghai states that the French Refugee Relief Committee of Shanghai has raised one million francs in the past two months and remitted it to French President Pétain's government. French Consul General in Shanghai, Major Ma Jie, recently received a telegram from Vichy government's Foreign Ministry representative, President Pétain, expressing his gratitude. President Pétain also sent a letter of thanks to the committee and the donors.

### Japanese Ship Rams Pig Boat, Fourteen Drowned, 240 Pigs Fall into River, Ship Damages Four More Boats While Docking

The Japanese ship *Shin Tama Maru*, with a load of 6,000 tons, loaded 2,000 tons of wheat and 240,000 bags of flour from overseas. At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, as it was entering the Songhu port and passing near Yangshupu, a pig boat carrying 240 live pigs from Jiangbei to Shanghai for sale happened to be in front of it. The *Shin Tama Maru* was traveling at high speed, and the pig boat could not avoid it, resulting in a violent collision in the middle, causing it to capsize and shatter. Sixteen boatmen fell into the water at the same time. Two were rescued, but the remaining fourteen drowned, their bodies sinking without a trace. All the live pigs drifted onto the river surface. Incredibly, when the ship arrived at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong to drop anchor, it also crushed four empty wharf boats. The respective owners have reported the damages to the Customs Water Police. To compensate for the deficit, it is proposed to transfer 1.5 million yuan from the general reserve fund. After the transfer, the amount of the deficit will be reduced to 7… 2,100 yuan. The following table provides a general overview.

### Russian Female Doctor Specializes in Abortions for Pregnant Women, Truth Revealed After Russian Woman Becomes Ill After Childbirth, Two Fetuses Found in Toilet

The gynecology hospital opened by Russian female doctor Irina Iglikova (49 years old) at Room 3, No. 1491 Xiafei Road, is ostensibly a hospital, but in reality, it is a secret abortion mill. Because the hospital is mysteriously equipped, it has been open for 15 years and has never been discovered.

Russian Woman Has Abortion

On the 10th of this month, a Russian girl, Vera Belik (19 years old, residing at No. 265 Luban Road), who works as a hostess in a bar on Xiafei Road, was four months pregnant. For the sake of her reputation, she went to the hospital to request an abortion, agreeing to a procedure fee of 200 yuan. The hospital director, Irina Iglikova, and Russian nurse Valentina performed the operation, removed the fetus, and threw it into the hospital's toilet. By chance, the hospital's hired nanny, Gao Zhu, discovered the dead fetus floating out while cleaning the toilet the next morning. She took it out and intended to throw it in the trash can, but was spotted by a Western child from a Western family next door, who reported it to the alleyway watchman, who intervened. Gao Zhu then took the fetus back to the hospital director, who instructed her to dispose of it elsewhere.

Church Reports

Unexpectedly, Russian girl Vera Belik became seriously ill after childbirth due to the hospital's poor abortion procedures. She went to the Central Church Hospital on Shanzhong Road for diagnosis. After the hospital doctor diagnosed her, he learned that the girl's illness was entirely caused by the abortion. Upon questioning, Vera Belik told the truth. The hospital authorities believed that Irina Iglikova was inhumane and reported it to the French police, requesting an investigation. The police sent detectives to investigate near the hospital and told the alleyway watchman about the above facts. Then they went to the hospital to investigate. Irina Iglikova initially prevaricated, but the detectives searched the toilet and discovered two more fetuses that had been aborted for four or five months. They arrested the hospital director, Irina Iglikova, the nanny Gao Zhu, and the nurse Valentina, along with the two fetuses, and took them to the police station.

Taken to Police Station

Afterwards, detectives investigated the hospital and discovered that an American and European young woman and a Zhenhai young woman, Ding Luxiuwen (27 years old), residing at No. 10, Lane 6, Rauldon Road, had also had abortions at the hospital and had not yet been discharged. In addition to sending the American woman to the American Consulate for investigation, Ding Chenxiuwen was also arrested and taken to the police station. After a doctor's examination proved that she had indeed had an abortion, they were investigated together. The director, Irina Iglikova, Vera Belik, and Ding Luxiuwen, were deemed to have violated humanity and violated the criminal law and were to be detained and dealt with according to law. The nanny, Gao Zhu, and the nurse, Valentina, were released as they were not involved. Yesterday morning, they separately hired lawyers such as Du Xi to go to the police station to request bail. The police authorities temporarily allowed Vera Belik and Ding Luxiuwen to be released on bail of 5,000 yuan each, while Irina Iglikova was still detained.

### Midwife Performs Abortion, Maid Dies

Jiangbei woman Sun Zhang, 29 years old, worked as a maid for a certain family at No. 3 Fuxingfang, Biancaishi Road. Recently, because she was three months pregnant and her abdomen was gradually enlarging, making it inconvenient for her to work, she asked the elderly midwife Shi, who lived at No. 68 Laoshenfu Road, to give her medicine to induce an abortion. Unexpectedly, her uterus was injured, and she bled continuously and was bedridden. The employer found out and sent her to Guangren Hospital by car at 11:00 PM on the 24th. The treatment was ineffective, and she died at 3:00 PM yesterday. The hospital reported it to the police, who sent detectives to investigate and sent the body to the coroner's office for examination today. Meanwhile, the detectives arrested Chen Shi, who had performed the abortion, and detained her for investigation.

### Public Bus No. 10 Crushes Worker to Death

At the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Beijing Road, at around 11:10 PM last night, a public bus No. 10, number 15109, sped past. A worker-like man, around 20 years old, wearing Zhongshan cloth clothing and black leather shoes, was walking slowly. He was unable to avoid it and was knocked to the ground by the bus. The wheel ran over his abdomen, and he died instantly. A Sikh policeman summoned a car to transport the body to Tongren Hospital and then to the coroner's office for examination.

### Record of Wang Yanqin's Murder, Co-Stars in Opera Loving Each Other, Abandoning the Old for the New Leads to Murder

Wang Yanqin, the adopted daughter of Shenqu master Wang Xiaoxin, is a beautiful young woman in her twenties. She is currently performing at the Shanghai Huju Opera Troupe at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Nanjing Road. On the evening of the 23rd, she was stabbed in a vital area with a knife inside the Great World Cinema, and died after ineffective treatment. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that Wang's murder was caused by a love dispute. Here is a supplementary record of its beginning and end.

Love Develops Between Co-Stars

Wang Yanqin was originally from Wuxi. At the age of three, her parents sold her to Wang Xiaoxin as an adopted daughter, who raised her and taught her Shenqu opera. She became skilled in opera several years ago and performed with Wang Xiaoxin's troupe. A year ago, Wang's troupe disbanded, and Yanqin joined Liu Ziyun's troupe to perform at the Great World. Liu had a beloved apprentice, Du Hongbin, 32 years old, from Shanghai, who performed with Yanqin in the same troupe. The two developed from friendship to love, often going out together and secretly pledging their love. They also took photos together to commemorate their relationship. Later, Wang Xiaoxin's daughter-in-law, Wang Yaqin, formed a troupe and founded the Shanghai Huju Opera Troupe. Wang Yanqin then left Liu Ziyun and planned to join the Huju Opera Troupe to perform. However, she did not succeed due to disagreements over the terms.

Love is Not Dedicated, Another New Love

Du and Wang went to other places together to perform in the troupe. Recently, when the term expired, they returned to Shanghai. Wang Yaqin happened to be ill and unable to perform on stage, so she asked Yanqin to replace her. Du also returned to his teacher Liu Ziyun's troupe to perform. Every day, he performed at the Great World. Unexpectedly, Wang Yanqin was young and not dedicated to love. She fell in love with a Yu surname in the same troupe of the Huju Opera Troupe, and thus had the idea of abandoning the old and welcoming the new. Her feelings for Du gradually cooled. Du asked her to formally get engaged, but Yanqin sternly refused. She cut up the photos they had taken together and returned Du's half of the photo to him. She was passionately in love with Yu, causing Du to become jealous and resentful, and to have the idea of killing Yanqin to vent his anger.

Lured into Cinema, Dies Tragically

At 5:45 PM on the 23rd of this month, Yanqin finished performing at the Shanghai Huju Opera Troupe and planned to walk back to her residence at No. 1, Juanli, Maigaobao Road, Xiapu, French Concession. When she passed in front of the Great World, she was encountered by Du Hongbin, who lured her into the dark place where people were rare in the rooftop open-air cinema of the Great World Daxing Troupe. Du took out a sharp blade and stabbed Yanqin's throat once, creating a wound that was an inch long. After committing the crime, Du turned around and ran downstairs to escape. Ms. Wang fell to the ground and called for help. The tea boy discovered her and reported it to the accounting room, who reported it to the police. Ms. Wang was sent to Guangci Hospital, but died after ineffective treatment at 8:45 PM the next day. The body was sent to the coroner's office yesterday morning. After examination by Wo at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, it was claimed and transported by Wang Xiaoxin to the Shangtian Funeral Home for coffin preparation. The French police are now strictly pursuing the murderer. It is reported that although Du has fled, his family has asked someone to negotiate a reconciliation with the victim's family.

### Irregular Weather, Mortality Rate Still Not Decreasing

Due to the recent irregular weather, according to reports from the health departments of the two concessions, the number of deaths in the International Settlement in the past week was 1,030 Chinese and 18 foreigners, and in the French Concession, 196 Chinese and 9 foreigners, totaling 1,076. Among the types of illnesses, influenza, pseudo-cold, measles, and tuberculosis were the most common. Residents are advised to pay close attention to maintaining their health.

### Finance Flat Seas in Foreign Exchange; Ample Capital and Market Recovery

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw stable conditions. The exchange rates posted were 0.0625 higher for British pounds, 3 1/8 for GBTs, and unchanged for US dollars at 5.125 yuan. The black market for British and American currencies initially showed a slight tightening trend but later eased. This was initially due to collusion between Chinese banks in Shanghai and speculators, causing the futures market to tighten to 3 1/8 and 5.125 yuan. However, HSBC's willingness to sell at 5.1875 yuan and the subsequent selling by speculators alleviated the pressure. Although the Japanese bank absorbed some of the selling, there was still ample capital, leading to a gradual return to stability. After-market agreements included electronic communication with the United States to maintain the value of Chinese legal tender at an appropriate time, and rumors circulated of a new $100 million loan agreement. As a result, speculators took profits, selling a significant amount of US dollars, between 1.6 and 1.7 million, pushing the price to 3 2/8 and 5.28. At closing, the market had recovered by 0.015615 and 0.06, respectively, compared to the previous day, with a similar loosening in futures prices.

HSBC Posts Higher British Pound, Unchanged US Dollar

The morning started with larger spreads in London, with near and far terms rising by 0.0615 each. Silver prices in New York and gold prices in London remained stable. The exchange rate for British pounds against US dollars was unchanged, while against Shanghai it contracted by 0.09375. The US dollar remained stable against the British pound but was slightly down by 0.12 yuan against Shanghai. The Central Bank's posted rates remained unchanged. At the morning opening, the spot selling prices were 3 2/8 for British pounds and 5.12875 yuan for US dollars, with no significant changes from the previous day. After the opening, Chinese banks colluded with speculators, causing the market to tighten. Chinese banks in Shanghai settled US dollar futures for March at 5.15625 yuan, and there were rumors of speculators buying April US dollar futures at 5.125 yuan, but this could not be confirmed. The April British pound also softened to 3 1/8. When HSBC posted its rates, the British pound was up by 0.0625, while the US dollar remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced, posting a rise of 0.25. Subsequently, HSBC suddenly sold March US dollar futures at 5.1875 yuan, and speculators, having stopped colluding, started selling. Although the Japanese bank had briefly colluded, the market gradually eased. The Japanese bank absorbed spot US dollars at 5.1875 and 5.21875 yuan. At midday, speculators sold March US dollar futures to HSBC at 5.25 yuan. The closing prices were 5 2/8 yuan and 3 2/8.

Afternoon Supply from Foreign Banks

The afternoon market initially showed a stable to loose trend. Around 3 PM, due to negative news, speculators sold. HSBC also reportedly offered to sell, but American banks continued to absorb the supply, with trades opening for March US dollars at 5.25 and 5.28125 yuan. As a result, the closing prices were 3 2/8 for British pounds and 5.28125 yuan for US dollars. The futures for March and April were both posted at 3 2/8 for British pounds and 5.25 yuan for US dollars, showing a decline of 0.015625 for the spot British pound and a rise of 0.0625 for the US dollar compared to the previous day.

Hong Kong US Dollar Still Tightening

Tianjin Tight US Dollar, Higher British Pound and Gold

Tianjin, 25th (Tuesday) - This morning, the exchange market continued to fluctuate. The London telegraphic transfer rate eased by 0.25, to 3 1/2 pence. The New York telegraphic transfer rate tightened by 0.03125, to 5.71875 yuan. The Shanghai dollar rose by 0.5 yuan, to 90.025 yuan. "Joint Notes" in the black market rose sharply by 2.25 yuan, to 68.25 yuan.

### Wild Fluctuations in Foreign Currencies

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw prices rise and fall sharply. British and American gold pounds ultimately fell by 3 yuan, and British gold notes remained sluggish and stabilized. American gold notes fluctuated wildly, initially rising to 19.4 yuan but subsequently falling, retreating to 18.72 yuan in the afternoon, down by 0.43 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes rose and then stabilized. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes saw increasingly fervent price increases, with the former rising to 2.14 yuan and the latter rising to 1.73 yuan.

### Grain: Abundant Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai, Lower Premium

Foreign rice prices fell yesterday due to a large influx of shipments, including two ships from the French Line, Da Yuan and Nan Hao, and ships from Jardine Matheson and Swire, totaling no less than thirteen to fourteen thousand bags. However, dealers were hesitant and held back. Local demand was limited, with only inland merchants procuring goods at lower prices. As a result, after a brief rally in the morning, prices were unsustainable and fell. The premium in the early morning black market had risen by two to three hundred yuan compared to the previous night, but it quickly stabilized. Selling pressure intensified in the afternoon, and buyers disappeared, causing the market to plummet by five to six hundred yuan. For example, the premium for small-kernel rice in the morning once reached 3,900 yuan per hundred bags but then fell to 3,600 yuan. In the afternoon, it declined from 3,500-3,600 yuan to 3,400 yuan. Other types of rice, such as Saigon rice, did not fall in the afternoon, but market asking prices were generally reduced by two to three hundred yuan. Saigon No. 1 opened at 3,200 yuan in the morning, then fell to 3,000 yuan. No. 2 fell from 3,500 yuan to 3,300 yuan. Broken rice was at 2,700 yuan, and even at 3,500 yuan in the afternoon, there were few buyers. As a result, the evening closing was about two yuan lower than the previous night's closing. Total trading volume for the day was still over 10,000 bags.

Another shipment of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. The French Line's Albert Sarraut, managed by the Hua Lun Yang Hang, arrived directly from Saigon with 2,399 tons, totaling 23,856 bags, all of which was broken rice. It arrived yesterday morning and docked at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong for unloading. Also, the Swire Company's Sichuan steamer arrived yesterday afternoon and docked at the company's wharf in Pudong. (Zu)

Local rice, including thick and thin japonica varieties, suddenly softened again. As a result, despite limited arrivals, market prices were difficult to maintain. Thick japonica, in particular, faced weak demand for mid-grade goods due to its higher base price, forcing sellers to lower prices, resulting in a significant drop of three to four yuan. Kunshan coarse japonica was only at 113-114 yuan per dan. High-quality goods, due to scarcity, depreciated slightly by one to two yuan. Common coarse japonica opened at 124-125 yuan per dan, high japonica at 122 yuan, Kunshan high japonica at 120 yuan, and 118-119 yuan. Medium-grade japonica was at 116 yuan. Thin indica rice had already fallen significantly, and sellers, considering their costs, were unwilling to sell at lower prices, resulting in no change amid their insistence. It still opened at 113-114 yuan per dan, and original bags were at 120 yuan, 119 yuan.

Glutinous rice prices, having risen again recently, saw sluggish retail sales. At the same time, many held-over goods were sold off at higher prices, causing the market to return to stability, with no signs of softening. Hong Kong special round-grain glutinous rice remained at 110 yuan, regular at 107-108 yuan, medium-grade at 105-106 yuan, and coarse at 104 yuan. Special glutinous rice fell from 100 yuan to around 91 yuan for broken rice.

### Flour Prices Gradually Stabilize; Fuxin Supplies Flour at Lower Prices

The flour market turned downwards yesterday, as the rumor-driven surge of the previous day had inevitably pushed prices up too quickly. Furthermore, another 40,000 to 50,000 bags of flour for re-export to Hong Kong arrived, and a large amount of "Kan" flour was expected to arrive in Shanghai within a few days. Profiteering hoarders took the opportunity to sell. Amidst sluggish actual sales, "Hua Niao Lian Lou" brand Australian flour continued to ease to 30.02 yuan, and "Jin Long" brand "Kan" flour opened at 29.5 yuan, as the market gradually returned to normal. A total of over 5,000 bags were traded in the general market. In addition, Fuxin supplied 1,873 bags of its own factory's flour, which, combined with the foreign flour designated by the Municipal Council, totaled 8,318 bags for purchase by designated merchants at a price of 2.75 yuan. It is reported that Fuxin factory is prepared to sell 250,000 bags at low prices, which should meet the city's needs for one and a half months. Supplies are not provided to out-of-town merchants or other sales venues, demonstrating a willingness to sacrifice profits. In an era of hoarding and speculation on food, this action is commendable. It is hoped that the distribution will be appropriate, so that the benefits can be extended to the public.

The wheat market remained stagnant. Both supply and demand for domestic wheat were scarce, with no regular market. Apart from previously arrived foreign wheat, there were no further arrivals. Demand for raw materials from both Japanese and Chinese mills could not be initiated for the time being. The market remained as silent as ever.

### Securities: "Tong Jia" Continues Downtrend for Three Days; Other Securities Remain Flat

The over-the-counter market for public bonds was slightly firmer yesterday, but trading prices were highly inconsistent, showing significant discrepancies. "Jia" bonds have been falling for three consecutive days, declining by 1.4 yuan, while "Bing" bonds only declined by 0.65 yuan. The reason for this disparity is that a certain firm, due to financial problems, sold off its holdings of "Jia" bonds to raise cash, resulting in this abnormal situation. Some people absorbed the bonds at lower prices, thus benefiting from the lower prices. Regarding news, there were rumors that the United States would provide a loan to support the legal tender and that a non-aggression pact between Japan and the Soviet Union was about to be concluded, both of which were said to be signed on the 27th. These two pieces of news had the opposite effect on public bonds. It remains to be seen whether the news will be proven to affect the future trend of public bonds. Trading was extremely thin yesterday, with slight increases in all bonds except for "Jia" bonds, which had a small face value, few remaining periods, and multiple draws. The usual standard difference of 10 yuan between "Jia" and "Yi" bonds was now only 9 yuan. Heng Kang, Tong Kang, and Xin Fu all bought in the morning and afternoon, while Ren Chang and Yong Kang both sold in the morning and afternoon. Da Kang, Cheng Yi, Tai Yong, and Yong Fu made minor purchases. Heng Fu, Yi Chang, Xing Chang, Ren Chang, and Jiu Fu all made sales. As a result, "Jia" bonds declined by another 0.25 yuan, while the others rose by about 0.1 yuan. The total trading volume was only about one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading: A single transaction occurred with 200 shares of "Zhong Yi" shares, priced at 15.5 yuan.

The "Zhong Ye" stock market was quiet all day, with no great interest from buyers. Most prices were softer than before, and rubber stocks were lifeless.

### Yarn and Cotton: Heavy Pressure on the Yarn Market

The yarn market rose and then fell, but the trend remained erratic. This was due to sluggish actual transactions, difficult transportation, and obstructed sales channels. However, the shrinking foreign exchange and rising margins allowed buyers to be active. In order to promote sales of existing goods, factories made special adjustments to the spot prices of Shuang Ma yarn, making them 100 yuan cheaper than the warehouse receipts. Another 450 bales were offered today at a price of 1,330 yuan, which was accepted by customers who sold their factory receipts, earning a profit of 100 yuan per bale. As a result, the market was looser. In addition, the performance of miscellaneous brand yarns was mediocre. In this regard, the pressure on the market was heavy. The high price for 20-count Shuang Ma yarn was 1,442 yuan, and the low price was 1,415 yuan. The initial price for the afternoon was 1,415 yuan, falling to 1,403 yuan, and finally settling at 1,405 yuan. Today, 1,465 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

The morning opening of Shuang Ma rose slightly due to the positive momentum from the afternoon of the previous day, with the first trade at 1,440 yuan, rising slightly to 1,442 yuan. Subsequently, those who profited took the opportunity to sell, and securities firms also sold. At the same time, those who were hedging also became active, and the market immediately fell to 1,420 yuan. It fluctuated at this price for a long time, but actual sales were sluggish, margins declined, and sentiment became more uncertain. There were more profit-taking sales, and the price fell to 1,415 yuan at the closing. The total trading volume in the morning was 6,750 bales. A breakdown of the quantity bought by each firm is listed below:

### Cotton Trading: Relying Only on Inter-Dealer Trade

The spot cotton market is relatively firm, but factory acceptance is sluggish. However, inter-dealer transactions are very lively. Therefore, white cotton and Xing Heng cotton prices are relatively high. Yesterday, a total of 652 bales were traded between dealers. A breakdown is recorded below:

The New York cotton market initially rose due to inter-dealer purchases, but later fell back slightly due to hedging sales by Southern firms and sales by spot merchants. As a result, the closing price was higher by one to two points than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market was volatile. It initially rose due to short covering but then fell back due to sales by European exporters and profit-taking. Finally, it fell again due to public sales. The closing price yesterday, except for white cotton, which rose by seven rupees, all others fell by one to two "pan" rupees. The forecast for yesterday was still flat, with only a slight drop of half a rupee.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market remained active and firm. However, due to slow progress in the yarn market and a slight sense of unease due to the unstable situation, the enthusiasm was not as high as before. Inter-dealer transactions have remained active in recent days. Indian cotton has arrived in Shanghai. The Swire Company's Sichuan steamer arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. In addition to a large shipment of foreign rice, there were also 1,102 bales of cotton.

### Coal: Coal Balls Soar to Unprecedented Levels

Coal ball prices have soared recently. Yesterday, the factory claimed that the tight foreign exchange and difficulties in obtaining supplies had caused prices to rise sharply by 40 yuan. The factory price is now 226 yuan per ton, and the delivery price is 120 yuan. The retail price in local stores is 12 yuan per "dan." This massive price increase is unprecedented and is clearly due to speculation by unscrupulous merchants who are intentionally manipulating prices, threatening the people's livelihood.

### Large Amounts of Bulls Exit, Gold Market Plunges

Yesterday's over-the-counter gold market rose sharply before suddenly reversing course and falling dramatically. After breaking through 8,700 yuan, it immediately retreated and eventually fell below 6,600 yuan. Originally, the market opened at 6,720 yuan, the same as the last off-market price from the previous day. As the market turned from firm to uncertain, news circulated that the United States would provide another $100 million loan to China, causing foreign exchange to stop tightening and suddenly recover. The bulls became even more uninspired, and foreign exchange dealers, banks, gold merchants, and securities firms sold aggressively. As a result, the price plummeted from 6,725 yuan to the edge of the 6,600 yuan level. Upon hearing that the US dollar had stopped easing due to HSBC's absorption, the price was again supported by money changers, rising by 60 to 70 yuan. At midday, the price fell again under the selling pressure from two groups in the gold market. In the afternoon, as foreign exchange tended to ease, rumors spread that a major player in western Shanghai was shorting, causing the decline to sharpen, falling to 6,555 yuan and ultimately settling at 6,568 yuan, a decline of 112 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. The rollover price (March to April) saw sellers from Shun He offering a premium of 300 taels to buyers from Da Feng, priced at 50 yuan. Cash also fell. Tong Kang and Yong sold 10 taels to Shun Ji, and Xiang He sold 20 taels to Lian Xing, both at a premium of 270 yuan over the futures price. Yong Feng Yu sold 20 taels to Zhong Xing at a premium of 150 yuan, and Shi He sold 50 taels to Fang Jiu Xia at a premium of 240 yuan. In the afternoon, Ming Feng sold 70 taels to Zhong Xing at a premium of 240 yuan. Ornaments also posted a small decline of 10 yuan, to 700 yuan. Customs gold and other prices remained flat.

Over-the-Counter Market Plunges by 110 Yuan

In the early morning, the price per "tiao" (ten taels) was initially posted (i.e., opening price), and there were many sellers. However, as the foreign exchange market reported softening, Yi Da, Yu Xing, and Yong came forward to absorb the supply, so the opening was still firm, at 6,720 yuan, which was 40 yuan higher than the previous day's trade. Subsequently, as Tian Yuan and Xin Yuan sold, the price declined by 20 yuan. However, as Gong He Yi Yuan and retail investors still had good buying interest, the price rebounded to 6,725 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange market eased, Yi Da and Heng Ji competitively sold, and Da Feng Cheng Ji sold on behalf of hedgers, the price suddenly fell to 6,605 yuan amid the selling pressure. Later, as Yi Da and Heng Ji stopped selling and instead bought, and Shun Yuan, Xiang Xing Yong, De Cheng, and Xiang He covered their short positions at lower prices, the price rose to 6,670 yuan. At midday, Cheng Ji and De Fu sold, while Heng Ji and De Da aggressively sold again, and the price fell again to 6,640 yuan. However, as Tong Kang Yong suddenly absorbed 600-700 taels, the price rose again to 6,653 yuan. However, the closing price was 6,647 yuan. The afternoon opening saw a decline of 7 yuan, to 6,640 yuan. Afterwards, Heng Ji, Yi Da, and De Cheng initially sold to each other. However, as De Fu and others still had buying interest, the price fluctuated between 6,620 and 6,630 yuan for a while. However, around 3 PM, due to hard foreign exchange market reports and negative news, Yi Yuan, Da Feng, Lian Dian, and Xiang Xing Yong competitively sold, breaking through the 6,600 yuan level and reaching 6,590 yuan. Later, although Xiang He, Xin Feng Yong, and Li Tai absorbed the supply, the selling intention of Da Feng, He Sheng, Tian Yuan, and Gong He was strong. By the evening, the price had fallen to 6,555 yuan. At closing, Da Feng and Heng Ji bought, settling at 6,568 yuan. As a result, the price declined by 112 yuan compared to the previous day. The off-market price declined by several yuan more, settling at 6,613.33 yuan based on the April US dollar settlement price of 5.25 yuan, which was 65.33 yuan lower. The total fluctuation for the day was 170 yuan. The cash price for gold was 280 yuan higher than the futures price, with purchase reductions of 70-80 yuan. The margin was nonexistent, and there was no market.

Ornaments Also Posted a Small Decline of 10 Yuan

The exchange rate for gold ornaments per tael was 10 yuan lower at 10:30 AM. Da Tong Hang changed its posted price to 700 yuan, while the new exchange rate was similar, with purchase reductions of about 40 yuan.

### Regarding the Issue of Relief Funds for Teachers and Staff: Local Authorities in this City urgently Telegraph the Ministry of Education, Requesting Swift Remedies Regardless of Approved Proposals; Earnestly Urging Prudent Distribution to Maintain Overall Stability and Pacify the Public; Educational Organizations Advocate for Re-Distribution of Entire Fund; Making Reasonable Requests to Avoid Neglecting Teaching and Striking

(Dahua News Agency) Regarding the issue of relief funds for teachers and staff in this city, the local education authorities yesterday urgently telegraphed Minister of Education Chen, with the original text as follows:

Most urgent, to Minister of Education Chen,

The Educational Communications Weekly reported that the allocation of the 800,000 yuan relief fund has been finalized, with over half going to 22 colleges and universities, and the rest to 69 middle schools, including those run by the Ministry, the city, the province, and some private schools. The majority of middle schools and the entirety of elementary schools have not received any relief, causing widespread confusion and public outcry, potentially leading to serious consequences. Regardless of whether a decision has been finalized, we earnestly request swift remedies and prudent distribution to maintain overall stability and pacify the public. We await your urgent instructions.

### Educational Organizations Issue Declaration

(Dahua News Agency) According to reports, the Executive Yuan allocated 800,000 yuan in relief funds for teachers and staff in Shanghai. The Ministry of Education has already finalized the allocation, with half going to private colleges and universities, and the remainder to 69 schools run by the Ministry, the city, the province, and some private middle schools. Although the relevant authorities in this city have not yet received official orders, this has already attracted great attention from the education community. Many believe that such an allocation, if true, is unfair. Educational organizations in this city, such as the Shanghai Education Association, the Middle School Friendship Association, the Municipal Sports Association, the Middle School Education Research Association, the Middle School Guidance Research Association, the Art Education Research Association, the Elementary Education Research Association, and the Boy Scouts Academic Research Association, jointly issued a declaration yesterday, expressing their views on this matter. The original text is extracted below:

### Original Declaration

Yesterday, we read the news report from Dahua News Agency's Chongqing dispatch, stating that according to the Ministry-compiled Educational Communications Weekly, the Executive Yuan has allocated 800,000 yuan in relief funds for Shanghai, and the allocation has been finalized, with 400,000 yuan going to private colleges and universities, and the remaining 400,000 yuan going to 69 middle and vocational schools run by the Ministry, the city, the province, and some private schools. Although the relevant authorities in this city have not received official orders and cannot confirm the information, as the news has been published in the Ministry of Education's official gazette, it can be considered credible. For the sake of the overall education in Shanghai, our association and others cannot remain silent and hereby jointly express our views on this matter as follows:

Current Allocation is Unfair

The purpose of this relief fund is to provide for the livelihoods of teaching staff. Regardless of the level of service or the difference in compensation, the allocation criteria should not differentiate between elementary, middle, and universities. Regardless of whether the original proposal specifically targeted teachers and staff in middle and upper schools, even if we assume it did, Shanghai only has 22 private colleges and universities, while there are nearly 200 middle schools. Allocating 400,000 yuan to colleges and universities while allocating only 400,000 yuan to middle schools is disproportionate. That is one point. Even focusing on middle schools, public schools should certainly receive relief, but private schools should also be treated equally. Currently, public schools have already received relief, while the majority of private schools are left empty-handed. What criteria were used to make this allocation? It is truly perplexing. That is another point. The suffering of elementary school teachers is even greater than that of middle or university teachers. The Shanghai authorities have repeatedly, based on the requests of education colleagues, forwarded requests to the Ministry of Education for relief to elementary schools as well, but the result is that elementary schools receive nothing. This is truly unconvincing. That is a third point. Based on these reasons, our association and others strongly oppose the allocation method reported in the newspapers.

Equal Relief for All

Our association and others believe that the relief of teachers and staff should not be differentiated. In other words, the relief criteria for elementary, middle, and universities should be the same, whether based on the number of people or the number of teaching hours. However, it should not be based on the rank of the position. It must be understood that in reality, the lower the rank, such as elementary school teachers, the greater the suffering and the more urgent the need for relief. Even if we cannot favor elementary school teachers, we cannot disfavor them. However, the reported news not only shows unfair allocation among universities and middle schools but also leaves the elementary school sector completely without relief. This type of allocation method violates the purpose of relief. Our association hereby appeals to the local education authorities in this city to urgently submit a request to the Ministry of Education to revise the allocation method based on the principle of equal treatment for all levels of schools.

Increase Funding by 600,000 Yuan

If it is said that the allocation of 800,000 yuan is limited to middle and upper schools by the Executive Yuan, then our association believes that the Ministry of Education should continue to submit a request to the Executive Yuan to allocate a large amount of additional funding specifically for the relief of the elementary school sector. Based on the current number of schools, the number of grades, and the number of people at all levels, the relief fund for elementary schools should be at least 600,000 yuan. The existing 800,000 yuan allocated to middle and upper schools should be subject to a new fair and reasonable allocation method, eliminating the 50-50 ratio of 400,000 yuan each. Every school that has obtained legal status should receive equal relief.

Re-Allocate the Entire Fund

The above opinions of our association and others have been carefully considered and are deemed fair and reasonable. If the local education authorities in this city can prioritize the overall situation and treat all levels of education personnel equally, we will certainly express our deep sympathy. Our association hereby submits the following three specific requests: (1) The allocated 800,000 yuan relief fund should be subject to a new fair and reasonable allocation method. (2) Request the Executive Yuan to allocate an additional relief fund of 600,000 yuan. (3) To seek a reasonable allocation method, please have the Ministry of Education assign personnel related to education in this city and representatives from educational organizations to form a relief fund allocation committee to jointly find a reasonable solution.

Reasonable Requests, No Neglecting Teaching

Shanghai education personnel have been struggling in the isolated island for almost four years. They should all be deeply grateful for the government's allocation of relief funds. However, based on the spirit of sharing weal and woe, since we have received relief, it should not be biased. Members of our association and others, based on this view, are unwilling to receive the relief fund prematurely until a fair allocation is achieved, to demonstrate the spirit of sharing weal and woe among educational colleagues. At the same time, we wish to broadly inform the citizens of this city that until a satisfactory resolution is achieved for this relief issue, we will continue to make reasonable requests along reasonable avenues under the principles of not neglecting teaching and not striking. We will not relax our efforts until our goal is achieved. We hope our sincerity will be understood.

### Children's Day on April 4th: Free Park Admission for Children; Approval Obtained from Municipal Council

The Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association sent letters to the authorities of the two settlements, requesting that children be allowed to visit parks free of charge on Children's Day, April 4th, to celebrate the holiday. It has now been learned that the association received a reply from the Shanghai Municipal Council approving the request. All children's groups in this city wishing to visit parks on Children's Day should follow the following procedures: (1) All schools and children's groups intending to visit parks within the settlement on Children's Day should send a letter to the Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association at No. 208 Zhonghui Building, Edward Road, before March 28th, so that the association can forward the request to the Municipal Council for the issuance of free park admission passes. (2) The request letter must state: A. Which park they wish to visit; B. The time of the visit; C. The number of children; D. The number of adults accompanying the children. (3) All children visiting the park must wear a specially made commemorative badge of the association to celebrate the holiday (schools are responsible for encouraging students to purchase these badges for 0.2 yuan each; the association will donate them to poor children in various children's groups). (4) All children's groups requesting to visit the park should send representatives to the association on April 3rd to collect the free park admission passes. The association will not send further written notices.

### People Who "Love" to Be Sick

— Zhong Zimang

Some people love to be sick.

Take Mr. Wu for example. Mr. Wu is a "celebrity" type, wealthy and influential. He travels by car and lives in a magnificent "private residence." Logically, Mr. Wu's family should be carefree, but the unbreakable law of "some people love to be sick" holds true. Mr. Wu's first wife often complains of back pain, while his second wife often complains of headaches.

Therefore, Mr. Wu has a designated doctor who sits at home almost every day, waiting for these two wives to get sick. These wives usually get sick around noon, especially on rainy days. But by night, their illnesses seem to disappear. Perhaps it's the doctor's "prescription" that makes them excited. The first wife drags Mr. Guo to play mahjong, while the second wife pulls Mr. Wu to dance, making Mr. Wu's life as a husband "difficult." When Mr. Wu proposes a compromise favoring the first wife, the second wife's illness immediately flares up. She holds her head, complaining of dizziness and pain, and collapses on the sofa. The first wife also puts on a stern face and says, "You stinky thing, putting on airs... Hmph!" Then she points at Mr. Wu, "You, you, you..." and then cries out in back pain, completing the "ritual."

Mr. Wu is naturally annoyed. Fortunately, he is used to being a "mediator" in society, so he might as well practice at home. He goes left to comfort his first wife's "back" and right to inquire about his second wife's "head." However, Mr. Wu truly feels disgusted. At this point, Mr. Wu habitually wants to talk to his daughter, but when he reaches the door of her "boudoir," the young lady's maid already says, "Miss is sick and sleeping!"

Mr. Wu is disappointed, but he still has to ask carefully. His daughter gets out of bed, acting spoiled, and says to her father, "My eyes hurt. How can I handle such thick English books? Sigh!" The young lady seems a little weary.

Mr. Wu thinks it's just this kind of thing, so he pats his daughter's shoulder and says, "What's the matter? I'm on the board of directors, silly child, what are you afraid of?"

His daughter smiles.

Mr. Wu nods, and the young lady's "illness" is mostly "cured."

Loving to be "sick" seems to be hereditary. Mr. Wu's young son, although just over eleven years old, also loves to be sick. When it's time for exams at school, he gets sick, lies in bed, and doesn't go to school. His mother says to Mr. Wu, "A'Da has a fever today!" When he recovers, he still needs a few days of rest - strolling in the park, eating fancy meals. The young master's illness is easy to get and easy to cure.

Sometimes Mr. Wu also thinks about this "family problem." Mr. Wu is extremely dissatisfied. He believes that a person should have the courage to take risks, just like he himself made his way through hard work.

But recently, Mr. Wu also lacks energy. The reason is that people have recognized his true colors. Mr. Wu originally thought that riding "Ertouma" (a metaphor for speculation) was a "clever plan," but it was exposed. He has issued several "denials," but the "rumors" have become even stronger. Therefore, Mr. Wu is too lazy to see guests, too lazy to go out. He also feels like there's a black veil over his forehead, a blurry fog. Mr. Wu feels the need to lie in bed - and so, Mr. Wu also "loves" to be sick.

### "Robbing" and "Hoarding"

— Weiyang

It is said that Confucius, having served as the Prime Minister of Lu for three months, had already achieved a state where "no one picked up lost items on the road, and doors were not locked at night." Thinking of the honest and simple folk customs of that time, and then seeing the current white-daylight robberies by the impoverished, it's no wonder some people shake their heads and sigh, believing that "people's hearts are not as they used to be." Drawing such a conclusion by comparing the past with the present seems quite logical.

But unfortunately, they have forgotten another point, which is the great truth that Guan Zhong said: "When the granary is full, people know etiquette; when clothed and fed, people know honor and shame." Perhaps some people would say: "Starving to death is a small matter; losing integrity is a great matter." This saying can be used to measure certain kinds of people in a certain sense, but it is too much to ask of the impoverished.

Of course, "robbing" is a crime because it is doing "business without capital," but I don't think anyone would dare say that "hoarding" with capital is a virtue.

Take robbing rice, for example. Some people may sympathize, believing that it is the result of hunger and cold. Others believe that "although it is a very small matter, it will not affect the entire society. But great events in the world all start from the small, and if we do not pay attention to small things, it may cause great trouble in the future." Therefore, they loudly call on the authorities to pay attention to this point, because "small things, if not controlled, will become a great disaster."

To "avoid major events from happening in the future," the latter opinion will inevitably be adopted by the authorities, and in fact, it is already being implemented. I have personally seen the police waving batons to suppress the impoverished robbing rice.

In fact, it is not difficult to eliminate rice robbing. When the price of rice was over ten yuan, didn't we hear about such things happening? And Shanghai, in fact, does not lack rice, so the question is linked to the rice hoarders.

The hoarding of rice has aroused widespread condemnation from the citizens. The local news sections of various newspapers have devoted a great deal of space to discussing this issue. Various supplements have also used this as the central theme, demanding that the authorities punish the hoarders. The reason is very simple: "Food is the paramount necessity of the people." Who would willingly let their lifeline be strangled to death?

There are many calls for action, but the authorities are still slow to act. In fact, if the same methods used to deal with rice robbing were used to deal with rice hoarding, the problem would be largely solved. "The way of heaven is to diminish the surplus to supplement the deficiency." It is hoped that the authorities can also do this, and then the maintenance of social order will certainly be much easier.

Without "hoarding," there would be no "robbing." Every person who "cares about the people's suffering" should clearly understand the causal relationship between the two.

### Shanghai's "Big Scene"

— Qishui

"Sir"! You haven't heard or seen "robbing," have you? Surely, you live in a high-rise building, travel in a speeding car, and have never seen "robbing." "Sir," I have witnessed it, I have seen it too much!

Here it comes, a small cart, tied with four "bags" perhaps?

Look, look quickly! If you're late, you might miss this "shot." It's not like those romantic scenes in aristocratic cinemas, so delicate and cheesy.

Right? There are forty or fifty of them, aren't there? Disheveled, filthy, ragged clothes, how annoying! Really, just seeing them is irritating! They all have winnowing baskets and brooms in their hands.

Good, they've rushed up with a "boom"! Eh, "Sir" must be surprised, right? There are two people guarding the cart, before and after, glaring fiercely, carrying high-lifted carrying poles. One blow, and it's over! Either dead or half-alive. But they don't need your worry, they've rushed up. As long as it's not a gun, they're not afraid of countless wooden sticks!

The "big scene" is here. I apologize, it can't compare to Hollywood's multi-million dollar scenes. But there is one thing that "Sir" should take a look at. This is a fact, not a "puppet show"! It's full of the exchange of blood and sweat, heart-stopping... (I can't say it) I'm afraid, afraid to see the result!

Chih, chih... These few "techniques" must be swift "close-ups," right? Even famous martial artists don't have such skills. Right, "Sir"?

Ah, the man with the carrying pole is swinging it wildly, but the "pearl" (rice) is also pouring out angrily, hitting, stabbing bags, grabbing rice, sweeping rice, shouting...

"Help! Help!" Alas, the poor cart pusher is crying for help. He wants to grab, but he doesn't know who to grab! Before he can finish shouting for help, the old master is crying frantically. "Sir," we are all "miserable people," why "torment each other" so urgently? Humph, it's you who's fanning the flames!

"Sir," don't watch anymore, it's too offensive to the eyes! But, but remember this place is at the intersection of Aivenyi Road and Dahua Road, one of the "robbing" hotspots, with three or four incidents every day!

(5) The Division Between Love and Desire

"Put it over there!" Just as he was examining it intently, he suddenly heard Xiangqi's voice behind him. Looking back, Xiangqi was lifting the curtain and walking in. There was a girl of sixteen or seventeen in the room, placing two cups of tea, a plate of crispy dates, and a plate of foreign candy on a small table according to Xiangqi's direction.

"Let's sit down and talk!" Xiangqi first sat down on a chair at the lower end of the room, then forced a smile, trying her best to offer the seat of honor to Qiuhaitang.

The very pretty girl silently put down the two plates and then walked out with a full smile.

"This is a little servant girl who grew up in our house. She is deaf and mute by nature, but she is still clear-minded." Without waiting for Qiuhaitang to ask, Xiangqi automatically explained it to him. "Generally, a mute is also deaf at the same time because they cannot speak. Even if someone insults them, they cannot answer back. So, God pities them and readily teaches them not to hear, so they can feel better in their hearts." Qiuhaitang spoke very casually, as if he were in his own home.

Xiangqi smiled and nodded.

"Do you know why I asked you to come here?"

"Do you know why I asked you to come here?"

This question almost stumped Qiuhaitang, causing him to hold a cup of tea and hesitate for a long time before slowly blurting out the following dozen or so words, like a primary school student writing a composition:

"Because you want to be a permanent friend with me."

But these dozen or so words were indeed said too well. Their impact not only made the listener blush immediately and lower her head, but also made the speaker feel a tingling sensation on his face, as if he had committed a great crime.

The room was silent for about three or four minutes.

"Not just for that one reason," Xiangqi said, gathering her courage first, "I mean, I want you to know more about my life."

Qiuhaitang, with a very solemn attitude, glanced at the plate of bright green crispy dates on the small table and did not interrupt.

(64) "Boss, just take this one for me!"

New Movie Introduction

### "Battlefield Romance"

— Moye

Like a vigorous pine tree, like a flawless piece of jade, Mr. Wu Yonggang has always stood alone and upright in the film industry of the isolated island. Since "Yue Fei" and "Flower Queen", we have admired his unyielding struggle!

"Battlefield Romance" is a renamed version of "Female Knight Nie Yinniang," and its subject matter is taken from Tang Dynasty notebook novels, with the script written by Mr. Zhou Yibai. Undoubtedly, there may be some improprieties and oversights in the development of the plot and the handling of the subject matter. However, even from the standpoint of the seriousness of the theme and the unyielding attitude, we should express our encouragement!

In fact, the simplicity of the story does not hinder the progress of the entire play. Compared to "Fishing Song" and "Peach and Plum Tribulation", "Peach and Plum Tribulation" is deeper. Under the simple subject matter, the director's vivid handling highlights the theme. "Fishing Song" suffers from having too much material and insufficient refinement. "Battlefield Romance", however, is because the screenwriter focused on the performance of the story and neglected the process of plot development, which is a great pity in our eyes.

Of course, strictly speaking, the director seems to lack care in the composition of each frame, and it is not beautified. What is commendable is that he did not add awkward insertions in order to cater to the audience's interests. Taking the fight between Yu Qingzhong and the young Wang Zande (played by Wang Zhuyou) as the key to the development of the plot, and then using Tian Ji'an's killing of Nie Feng to reach the climax of the play, the development of this scene is very natural and appropriate.

Yuan Lan Jun is still consistent in her style, lithe and graceful, and even more dignified. She still lacks experience in the behavior of a nun, but she has improved compared to "Red Money Thief Box", that is, the refinement of her movements.

Among the villains, Wang Xianzhai has his own extraordinary talents. He can grasp the personality of roles from different classes, and his demeanor is very gentle, unlike Hong Jingling, who is too much. As for Tian Ji'an, although the script did not heavily rewrite the role, his performance has reached an extremely high level.

Wang Zhuyou and others are mediocre.

Here, there is no pornography, no vulgar low-level taste, and no love talk. All that is there is the sincere love of young men and women for their country, the bright praise, and the mobilization of compatriots!

### Father Came from Japan: Olivia de Havilland Refuses Assistance because Dad Married a Japanese Wife

— Wang Xuan

Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine are sisters. After working in Hollywood for many years, they have both become famous stars. Their father, William de Havilland, is British and in his seventies. He has been working as a lawyer in Tokyo, Japan. Recently, due to rising anti-British sentiment in Japan, no one hired him as a lawyer. Forced to leave Japan, he specifically went to Hollywood to find his two daughters, wanting nothing more than financial assistance. However, the de Havilland sisters, dissatisfied with what their birth father had done, straightforwardly refused.

After arriving in Hollywood, William de Havilland said to people: I have been practicing law in Tokyo for forty-seven years. The outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war destroyed my career, and I had to repeatedly ask my two daughters for assistance. They both ignored me, perhaps because I married a Japanese woman. I have decided to come to the United States alone, with only eighty yuan of income per month, which is not enough to live on in the United States. Therefore, I will go to South America. After I arrive at a suitable place, I will notify my Japanese wife to come and live a hard life, to spend our remaining years in the countryside.

Olivia and Joan Fontaine, upon seeing their father's interview, immediately called Mrs. Lillian Fontaine in Saratoga, California, their mother, and then released a statement in the old lady's name, saying:

"My daughters and I were shocked to hear that Mr. de Havilland had arrived in Hollywood, because since my separation and divorce from him, it has been twenty-one years. In this long period, my daughters and I have only met him once. Twenty-one years ago (1919), after I separated from Mr. de Havilland, I brought Olivia (now twenty-four years old) and Joan Fontaine (now twenty-three years old) to the United States to settle in Saratoga and become American citizens. The sisters were still babbling babies, and I raised them single-handedly to this day.

Nine years after my daughters came to the United States, I returned to Tokyo and completed the divorce procedures with Mr. de Havilland. In that year, he also came to the United States to visit his daughters, when the sisters were still teenagers. In reality, Mr. de Havilland and I had already severed our marital relationship."

After divorcing William de Havilland, Lillian Fontaine remarried to a businessman in California. Now, she lives happily in Saratoga, enjoying her old age.

### Shanghai Drama Movements: Yu Ling Leaves Shanghai for Hong Kong, Wu Chen and Mao Yu Both Resign

— Ping

The drama scene in 1940 passed quietly. This year seems to be quite turbulent. The Drama Club wanted to move to the Xuan Palace, but the venue fell through and returned to Lafayette; the China Travel Troupe withdrew from the Xuan Palace, entered the Lanzin, and scheduled to perform "Hong Xuanjiao", written by Wei Ruhui, on the 14th of next month. Recently, the Tianfeng Drama Society has raised the banner of professional drama and is performing "Thunderstorm" at the Xuan Palace. Starting with the facts above, changes are constantly taking place. Yu Ling, who has been supporting the Shanghai Drama Club, suddenly left Shanghai for Hong Kong a week ago. It is not yet known whether he will return to Shanghai. It is said that Yu Ling may have abandoned writing to engage in business, and may not return for the time being. In addition, Wu Chen, the former director of general affairs of the Drama Club, resigned half a month ago, and the authorities have retained him. Mao Yu, the director of public relations of the association, also submitted his resignation yesterday, because he is tired of working as an advertiser. Mr. Mao was invited to join the Drama Club when it was in the most difficult time, working from the Xuan Palace to the Lafayette, for more than a year, the longest time he has served as a publicist for the Drama Club. Since the Drama Club's successful performance of "Home", the economic foundation has been very stable. In the future, it should work hard on drama training and create a bright future for the future of drama.

### Blood Rain on Fine Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter Four: Swallows Kick at Flying Petals, Scattering the Dance Mat

As Li Xin spurred his horse forward, the crowd heard the ringing of bells behind them. Looking back, they saw Li Xin arriving, and everyone immediately made way for him. There were also stewards from Li Xin's estate standing together, watching closely. When Li Xin dismounted, two stewards hurriedly went over to take the reins of his horse, saying, "Master Li is here." Li Xin, with a stern face, questioned the stewards sternly, "What are you doing guarding the gate? Don't you know the rules of my estate? How can you allow street performers to make such a racket here?" The stewards replied with smiles, "Master Li, we originally didn't want these people to be noisy here, but they insisted on performing here. The gatekeeper, Fang the Fatty, has already been hit twice and is spitting blood back in the guardhouse. We had no choice but to keep an eye on them, waiting for Master Li to return before dealing with them." Upon hearing this, Li Xin became even angrier, saying, "Who dares to beat my servants? Disregarding the law! You must know that I, Li Xin, am not one to be trifled with." The stewards pointed towards the performance area, saying, "Please, Master Li, take a look." At this time, at the east and west ends of the area, bamboo poles were erected, with ropes tied between them. Atop the ropes was a beautiful young woman, dressed entirely in crimson clothes, walking back and forth on the rope, performing various skills. People below were beating gongs and drums to add to the atmosphere. Li Xin initially noticed that the woman had a phoenix bun atop her head, with a flower slantedly inserted, and some rouge applied to her cheeks. Her eyes were watery and charming, possessing a certain beauty. Her three-inch golden lilies, wearing narrow embroidered shoes, stepped onto the rope, leaping back and forth as if walking on flat ground. She was also singing very pleasant folk songs, indeed worth watching. He completely forgot himself and simply stared intently. Xu Jing had also dismounted and walked in. Li Xin pointed and urged Xu Jing to watch quickly. Seeing that Li Xin was no longer pursuing the matter, the stewards led the horse away and stood behind to watch. (21)
