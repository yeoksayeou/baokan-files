### Total Victory in Northern Hunan by Elite Troops: 50,000 Japanese Soldiers Encircled; Ying Tian, Following Lei Lu Lin Tan, Also Recovered by China; Japanese Plainclothes Squads Completely Eliminated in Suburbs of Changsha

Chongqing: Battle reports from the front lines in Hunan Province indicate that the battle situation in Changsha has largely stabilized. The Chinese army's counteroffensive is making significant progress. According to the latest Chinese sources, approximately 50,000 Japanese soldiers are currently encircled by Chinese forces in the northeastern mountains of Changsha, specifically in the areas of Chunhua Mountain, Yong'an City, and Huanghua City. These locations are situated between the Lao Dao River and the Liuyang River, that is, between Changsha and Liuyang. Liuyang River is a key city east of Changsha. To cut off the Japanese army's retreat, the Chinese army has completely occupied all major crossing points of the Miluo River behind the Japanese lines, extending from the eastern shores of Dongting Lake to Pingxiang on the main highway. In recent days, the Japanese army has desperately attempted to break through the Chinese encirclement, frequently deploying paratroopers behind Chinese lines, but these efforts have been thwarted by the Chinese army. There are now growing signs of a Japanese retreat. The Japanese troops who landed near Ying Tian and Lu Lin Tan have suffered heavy casualties after a fierce Chinese offensive and have re-embarked on their warships as of yesterday. It is reported that the Chinese Air Force has been actively cooperating with the ground forces by bombing Japanese positions near Huanghua City, northeast of Changsha, for several consecutive days. Yesterday, 23 Japanese aircraft bombed Hengyang, a key city in southern Hunan. Meanwhile, the Japanese forces advancing north from Guangzhou have been halted. According to Chinese sources, the Japanese column advancing along the North River, intending to support the Japanese column advancing north along the Yuehan Railway, has moved eastward towards the railway. Another Japanese column advancing from Huaxian on the east side of the railway has been stopped by the Chinese army. (Reuters, 1st)

Chongqing: According to telephone reports from Changsha, the Chinese army is tightening its encirclement of the 50,000 Japanese soldiers trapped. This morning, the Chinese army achieved a major victory northeast of the city, launching an offensive between Jinjing and Chunhua Mountain. It is claimed that 2,000 Japanese soldiers were killed and 30 tanks destroyed. Various public organizations in China are preparing to hold mass parades to celebrate the victory in Hunan. However, military authorities state that while China is gaining the upper hand and launching a final assault on the Japanese forces northeast of Changsha, celebrations should not be held until the final outcome of the battle is clear. (Reuters, 2nd)

Chongqing: According to reliable sources, the Chinese army's counteroffensive northeast of Changsha is yielding excellent results, with intense attacks continuing today. Solid results are expected tonight. Japanese plainclothes squads in Changsha have also been completely eliminated. According to a military expert who has commanded operations in northern Hunan and northern Jiangxi several times, the victorious conclusion of the northern Hunan campaign is now assured. After the Chinese army occupied various strongholds on both sides of the Miluo River, the Japanese army's land transportation line was cut off. Only supply lines from Dongting Lake remained. This route is not only direct, but also has a much greater shipping capacity than vehicles. Therefore, when the Chinese army launched its counteroffensive, it first focused its efforts on attacking Ying Tian and Lu Lin Tan at the mouth of the Xiang River, and recaptured them in one fell swoop. As a result, the Japanese army's supplies were completely cut off, and this morning there were signs of retreat. However, the Chinese army's fierce attack is not merely to defend Changsha, but to annihilate the Japanese forces, with the expectation of wiping out the elite Japanese 3rd and 4th Divisions. The expert highly praised the commander and a certain group army commander for consistently directing operations from the front lines, considering it a major key to the victory in this decisive battle. (Havas, 1st)

Chongqing: According to front-line news from Changsha at 6:30 PM tonight, the Chinese army's counteroffensive this morning was extremely successful in the Chunhua Mountain area. Progress was also made north of the Lao Dao River, with many key points captured. Lu Lin Tan, west of the Xiang River, was also recaptured. The Japanese troops at Ying Tian, north of that location, have retreated. The plainclothes squads discovered in Changsha last night have been eliminated. According to qualified sources, the Japanese side used plainclothes squads and paratroopers this time because they believed that the Chinese army would have already prepared to retreat as the Japanese army advanced smoothly to the suburbs of Changsha. Therefore, they intended to intimidate the enemy. However, the Chinese army's city defense troops and field army fought independently, with the field army closely pursuing and the city defense troops bravely resisting any invading enemy. As a result, the Japanese side's first attempt to use plainclothes squads and paratroopers ended in failure. (Havas, 30th)

Chongqing: General Xue Yue, commander-in-chief of the Ninth War Area, reported from Changsha by telephone to the high command here last night that the Chinese army on the Changsha front has begun a general offensive on all strongholds. "The results are extremely satisfactory, and a decisive victory can be achieved within one or two days." He also stated that within twelve hours, the gains of the Chinese army's counteroffensive included the recapture of Ying Tian and Lu Lin Tan. The above two points are where the Japanese troops landed from Dongting Lake. In addition, several strongholds in the northeastern and eastern regions of Changsha were also captured. Observers believe that if this news is true, the Japanese army's naval supply line will eventually be cut off. It was also reported that a small group of Japanese plainclothes squads re-entered Changsha, but it is believed that they will soon be surrounded by the Chinese army. The statement indicated that the high command is very confident about encircling the Japanese army. It was also stated that several hundred Japanese paratroopers landed on the main defense lines of the Chinese army in Changsha. Details are unknown. General Xue Yue also confirmed a report stating that the Japanese army has indeed begun to retreat towards Yuezhou today. (Associated Press, 1st)

Ever-Victorious General: Defending Changsha

Chongqing: Regarding the Japanese army's recent invasion from Yuezhou along the Yuehan Railway and the Xiang River, Japanese sources admit that they have encountered fierce resistance from the Chinese army under the command of General Xue Yue, commander of the Ninth War Area. Xue Yue is 45 years old this year and is one of the most skilled generals in the Chinese army. Two years ago, when the Japanese army first launched an attack on Changsha, they had already reached the city of Changsha. Changsha's terrain is flat, with no natural barriers to stop the Japanese army's tanks and armored vehicles. Therefore, at that time, many people expected Changsha would eventually fall. Xue Yue, who was then the administrative officer of the Ninth War Area, used his intelligence and commanded the Chinese army to launch a counteroffensive, achieving a complete victory. Changsha was defended. Xue Yue was highly praised by his superiors. The Japanese army, on the other hand, insisted that they did not intend to occupy Changsha and immediately retreated. Subsequently, Xue Yue replaced Chen Cheng as the commander of the Ninth War Area, rising to become a national hero. Xue Yue's record of repelling the Japanese army did not begin with that battle. In 1937, he participated in the famous Battle of Shanghai. After that, he led his troops in battles along the Nanxun Road and the Longhai Road, never suffering a defeat in any battle. Therefore, he is known as the "Ever-Victorious General." His most significant achievement was the Battle of Lanfeng, in which the commander of the Japanese 14th Division, Doihara, escaped the encirclement in a fighter plane. Today, the Japanese army is attacking Changsha again, and their purpose is likely to destroy Xue Yue's elite army of 400,000 men. This army is composed of the Central Army and troops from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. Xue Yue is from Guangdong, so the people of Guangdong are very pleased that Xue Yue is fighting in Hunan. Xue Yue was born in Lechang and received military education at an unknown military academy. He became known for his bravery as soon as he entered the battlefield. Among the senior Chinese generals, Xue Yue is not well known to the outside world because he is by nature dislikes propaganda and seeks to work practically. (International News Agency, 1st)

### Analysis of the Northern Hunan Campaign

After the fall of Kyiv, winter has gradually covered the fields of Northern Europe. Although the fierce fighting between the Soviet and German armies continues for days, and the Soviet counteroffensive in the central sector has achieved significant progress, it is generally believed that the war is gradually becoming a war of attrition, and neither side may be able to achieve a decisive victory in the short term. Meanwhile, the intense Northern Hunan campaign being waged by Japan is attracting great attention from both Chinese and foreign observers. Northern Hunan and Changsha are certainly not comparable to Leningrad or Crimea, but the gains and losses of this campaign are by no means a problem solely between China and Japan.

In the span of a few days, the fate of Changsha City has become an elusive enigma. The war reports issued by the opposing sides naturally cannot be entirely the same, but rarely has there been such an absolute contradiction and continuity in news regarding Changsha lasting for several days. Changsha is the capital of Hunan Province, but it is not the center of that war zone. The gain or loss of Changsha is one matter, and the gain or loss of the Northern Hunan campaign is another. The security of Changsha cannot guarantee the safety of the Northern Hunan campaign. Conversely, the unfortunate fall of Changsha is by no means a defeat in the war. From a purely military point of view, this is not a matter worth arguing about. However, if one examines the Japanese reports of capturing Changsha in recent days, it immediately becomes apparent that there are some undeniable loopholes. According to these reports, the Japanese army had already occupied all of Changsha on the night of September 27th, but four days have passed, and the only information disclosed is the course of the fighting on the outskirts of Changsha and aerial photographs of the urban area. There is no description of the specific situation after Changsha was "occupied." This is one point. Until about 5:00 AM yesterday, the Chinese side continued to receive telegrams from Changsha detailing various situations in the area, while the Japanese side, which claimed to have occupied Changsha for four days, rarely sent reports from Changsha reporting various details. This is another point. A group of foreign reporters invited to inspect Changsha only took an aerial view of the city and never set foot on the ground. Their reports, provided under the hospitality of the Japanese side, were also vague about how the Japanese army occupied the city and provided few explanations. This is a third point. Furthermore, the rapid "completion of their objectives and withdrawal" from Zhuzhou, and the fact that no Japanese flags were seen flying over Changsha City during the three-hundred-foot low-altitude flights, are all significant doubts. The final safety of Changsha remains to be seen as the situation unfolds, but the Japanese report that they had "completely occupied Changsha" four days ago is simply not credible.

The fact that the Japanese side so hastily issued this war report reflects their eagerness to win and their impatience. Their reckless and rash advance in Northern Hunan is also the result of this feeling. In fact, judging from the progress of the campaign over the past two weeks and the current situation, there is no reason for the Japanese army to be optimistic. According to the original Japanese strategy, they intended to advance on three routes simultaneously: the left wing would advance south along the Wuchang-Changsha Highway, the right wing would use warships to land troops at Ying Tian and Lu Lin Tan and advance along the Xiang River, and the center route would break through Xinqiang and Miluo to probe the front of Changsha. This arrangement was far simpler in scale than the previous autumn campaign. On that occasion, another route of the Japanese army advanced from west of Jiuling along the Wuchang-Changsha Highway to probe Pingjiang, and on the western Jiangxi front, they invaded Tonggu and Xiushui from Wuning and Fengxin to outflank the Chinese army in Northern Hunan. If the Japanese plan had succeeded in its entirety at that time, the situation in Northern Hunan would have been even more dangerous than it is now. Since the Japanese army launched an offensive on the Xinqiang front on September 18th, they were blocked at Guiyi and other places on the south bank of the Miluo River on the 21st. Since then, there has been no progress on the central route. Subsequently, they advanced east along the Miluo River, turned into the highway from Wukou and Wengjiang to Changsha from Pingjiang, and approached the outskirts of Changsha in a straight-line attack. As for the Dongting Lake route, although the Japanese army landed at Ying Tian and Lu Lin Tan, the reports yesterday stated that they had been recaptured by the Chinese army, which was inferior to the time when Yinxiang was captured in the previous autumn. As a result, they failed to coordinate and converge with their left-wing units that had advanced deeply. The Japanese army on the highway was completely isolated and in deep trouble. There was nothing strange about the fact that 50,000 Japanese troops came with such fierce momentum and even approached the outskirts of Changsha or even the suburbs, and that the flat terrain was not suitable for the Chinese army to block and fight a decisive battle. However, the deeper the Japanese army invaded and the farther away from the rear, the more difficult the supply and transportation became. Except for the route of the Japanese army's advance, the entire Northern Hunan area was always under the control of the Chinese army. The danger faced by this invading Japanese army is self-evident. On September 28th, the Chinese army launched a counteroffensive behind the Japanese lines, successively recapturing Changle Street, Wukou, Xinshi, Guiyi, and Lu Lin Tan at the mouth of Dongting Lake. By this time, the Chinese army had controlled the entire line along the Miluo River from Pingjiang Zhao Ying Tian, and the Japanese army's supply line was not difficult to cut off. The tens of thousands of Japanese troops near Changsha have been struggling to break through in recent days, but based on the current situation of the two armies, it is not only insufficient to achieve anything, but is instead about to fall into the encirclement and elimination by the Chinese army. Yesterday, Anami, the commander of the Japanese army in Central China in Hankou, reiterated the old tune that "the Japanese army's purpose is not land." It is expected that the date for them to declare that they have "completed their mission and retreated" may not be far off. As for whether they will be able to "retreat safely," it depends on the results of the Chinese army's operations.

As indicated earlier, the Japanese side's sudden invasion of Northern Hunan was driven by an urgent desire to achieve a major victory in order to relieve their difficult internal and external situations. They specifically chose Northern Hunan as the target because they had fought there several times and were very familiar with the terrain and military situation. Furthermore, the distance from Yuezhou to Changsha was short, and there were convenient transportation routes by railway, highway, and waterway. The flat terrain there also benefited the Japanese and disadvantaged the Chinese. However, if the Japanese army wins a battle, it is only a gain obtained by avoiding the important and choosing the easy, and it is not enough to show the strength of the Japanese army. If they lose the battle, it will only further expose the decline of the Japanese army and increase the unfavorable internal and external situation. This is why they have repeatedly reinforced their forces in this campaign in order to achieve their goals. The Japanese army's offensive in Northern Hunan has now gradually reached its limit. Therefore, the war reports in the next few days will be of great and decisive significance. After a long period of recuperation, the Chinese army has newly received assistance from friendly nations in both spirit and material, and it is believed that they will not disappoint those who love justice.

### Anniversary of the Establishment of the Provisional Capital Celebrated in Chongqing; Chongqing Will Remain a Transportation Hub; Its Importance Will Not Diminish After the War

Chongqing: Banners are being flown here today to celebrate the first anniversary of the establishment of the provisional capital. The Central Daily News published an article stating that Chongqing's importance will not diminish after the war. From a national defense point of view, Chongqing will remain an important center. After this war ends, Japan will certainly prepare for new invasions. Today, the national defense industry is concentrated in the southwestern provinces, so Chongqing will remain an important economic center. When the Yunnan-Burma Railway opens in the future, and other important international transportation routes are built, Chongqing will remain an important transportation hub. Therefore, we firmly believe that Chongqing will remain an important and prosperous city after the war. (Reuters, 1st)

### Relief Supplies for Leased Territories: U.S. Warships Escort Shipments to China; Pilots and Mechanics Accompany; U.S. Focuses on Far East Trade Routes

Reuter, Chongqing, 1st—Dr. Stephen Pan, former professor of international relations at Providence College of Rhode Island, stated in an interview with reporters today that U.S. warships are currently escorting merchant ships through the Pacific Ocean from Australia to Batavia, Singapore, and Rangoon. Dr. Pan, who recently arrived here via the Pacific, stated that he boarded a merchant ship in San Francisco on July 9. The ship carried two light bombers and 200 trucks to the Dutch East Indies, ten P40 fighter planes, 100 trucks, 40 American volunteer pilots and mechanics, four doctors, and two nurses to China. He stated that six alerts were issued en route, but there was no activity. U.S. naval officers on board were vigilant and implemented strict light control. The ship took a winding route across the ocean. The escorting U.S. cruisers remained outside territorial waters when the merchant ships approached port and departed when the merchant ships neared Singapore. Dr. Pan stated that the cargo carried by the merchant ships consisted of lend-lease supplies destined for China and the Dutch East Indies. The fleet was under the control of the U.S. Maritime Commission and arrived in Hawaii on July 16, departing twelve hours later. When outside territorial waters, a U.S. cruiser stopped the ship. Subsequently, an officer and two signalmen boarded the ship and spoke with the Dutch captain, Brook, for three minutes. The two signalmen then went to the lookout post, and from then on, there was constant communication with the cruisers. The cruisers remained in sight at all times. He said that they crossed the equator two or three times between Hawaii and Australia. Dr. Pan taught the American volunteers and medical personnel Chinese for two hours each day during the voyage. He said that they had learned enough vocabulary and aviation terms to meet their daily needs. At the same time, he lectured for one hour each day on the situation in China and Sino-American relations.

Reuter, Washington, 1st—Naval authorities yesterday declined to confirm or deny reports that the navy is protecting merchant shipping in the Pacific Ocean. The information came from Reuter, Chongqing. The so-called defensive zone has not been explained in detail. Officials have repeatedly pointed out the importance of the Far East trade route, as key raw materials are currently being transported from Malaya via the Philippines. This route is also essential for the transportation of aid to China. The only defensive zone officially declared by the U.S. and escorted by the navy is the Atlantic route to Iceland.

Reuter, Honolulu, 1st—Naval officials yesterday declined to comment on reports from Chongqing that the U.S. Navy is escorting merchant ships to the Far East, stating that any comment should come from Washington. Observers point out that a large number of naval vessels are concentrated in Hawaii, constantly entering and leaving Pearl Harbor. The movements of these ships are highly secret, but it is possible that they are engaged in patrols and escorts.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 1st—U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox published an article in the U.S. Department of Commerce Weekly, strongly arguing for the need to strengthen U.S. naval defenses and asserting that the Pacific route is the main route within the "defensive zone" between the U.S. and Australia, the Dutch East Indies, and India. The "Kokumin Shimbun" here declared that Japan's goal is to build a new order in East Asia, and regardless of the outcome of U.S.-Japan negotiations, this goal will not change. The Japanese government and people should be more united and strengthen national defense, as recent statements by key U.S. figures have revealed the true intentions of the U.S.

### Red Army Launches Counteroffensive; Situation in Leningrad Area Improves

Hand-to-Hand Combat Recaptures Several Towns; German Troops Advance on Kharkov from the South

Reuter, Moscow, 1st—News from the front yesterday stated that the Red Army has repelled German troops surrounding Leningrad and has recaptured lost territory in several areas. The news stated that the Red Army is not only implementing its slogan of "not retreating a single step," but Soviet troops are also advancing in several places. It also stated that in the past two weeks, the enemy's vanguard has not advanced a single step. "Pravda" published a telephone message reporting that Soviet troops now have the upper hand and are launching a counteroffensive, recapturing several towns. It also stated that in one area, the German 269th Division was repelled and suffered heavy casualties. The high command stated that the Red Army is continuing to fight along the entire front but did not elaborate. The army newspaper "Red Army Daily" stated that Soviet troops repelled German troops to a considerable distance after crossing a river, annihilated an enemy regiment, and recaptured the city of "B" on the riverbank.

Reuter, London, 1st—Kharkov, an important industrial and railway center, is now enveloped in the fog of war and is expected to be the most important battle in the Soviet-German war. Marshal Budyonny will undertake the greatest task of his professional life in this battle. Military experts state that the Soviet retreat from Poltava is the most serious threat to the most important industrial city in Ukraine and the entire Donets River basin. The Soviet retreat brings German troops within eight miles of Bizburg in southwestern Ukraine. After occupying Poltava, a city of 90,000 people, German troops also gained control of a valuable railway junction. However, the Soviet scorched-earth policy requires the Germans to repair the railway equipment extensively before it can be used. The continuous northward advance of German armored and motorized units may threaten the southern approaches to Moscow. British military experts point out that this threat is still 400 miles away, but they do not rule out the possibility of a two-pronged German attack on Moscow from the Leningrad sector in the north and from Ukraine in the south. They also state that the occupation of Kharkov is the greatest gain for the German southern army, as it can gain control of the railway to Rostov and Crimea and connect with the important railway to Moscow. Moscow claims that fierce fighting is taking place outside Crimea, indicating that German troops will continue to attack that area and prevent Soviet troops from attacking German troops advancing on Kharkov from the east.

### Great Battle in Ukraine Underway; Red Army Abandons Poltava

TASS, Moscow, 1st—The Soviet Information Bureau issued a war bulletin stating that on the 30th, our army engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy along the entire front. In Ukraine, our army withdrew from Poltava (75 miles southwest of Kharkov) after fierce fighting. Sixty-five enemy aircraft were shot down on the 28th, while we lost 27 aircraft.

International News Service, Moscow, 1st—The Soviet government bulletin today admitted that Poltava has fallen to German forces. The area is the gateway to the industrial Donets Basin. Although the Soviet side did not the loss's importance, the area is one of the ancient cities of the Soviet Union and is closely related to the rise of Imperial Russia in the 18th century. In 1709, Peter the Great defeated the Swedes there. Therefore, some believe that Soviet morale may be somewhat affected.

Reuter, Moscow, 1st—Soviet spokesman Lozovsky stated on Tuesday night that the German claim that the Soviet army lost 350,000 men in the Battle of Kiev was a lie, and the German claim that the Soviet army lost one million men was simply a threefold increase of the previous lie. In fact, the German army failed to encircle the Soviet army and did not capture the Soviet army. Ukraine is different from other parts of the front, as the fighting on the Ukrainian front is more fluid and has greater possibilities for movement. He knows that the great battle in Ukraine is still underway, and the German losses are high. The hope that most of the war could be resolved after the fall of Kiev has vanished. The Soviet army destroyed everything before leaving Kiev so that it would not benefit the enemy.

### Reports that Southern Red Army Commander Budyonny was Executed are Incorrect

Reuter, Moscow, 1st—Government spokesman and Deputy Foreign Commissar Lozovsky yesterday that reports from Germany and Italy that Marshal Budyonny, commander of the Southern Red Army, had been executed.

### Germany Implements Iron-Fisted Rule in Czechoslovakia; Nazi Executioners Launch Killing Spree; 59 Czechs Executed

Reuter, London, 1st—The German-controlled Prague radio station announced this morning that another 59 people had been executed by firing squad after being sentenced by a military court. Only ten of those executed's names have been released, including Dr. Grvie, a professor at the University of Brno, Colonel Kapicek, and the famous physician Vilik. It is reported that 252 people have been handed over to the German secret police, but no reason has been announced. One of them has been released.

Reuter, London, 1st—Reuter's diplomatic correspondent states that Czechs believe that Hitler will soon abandon the pretense of separate administrative organs in the protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia and remove President Hácha from office. The appointment of Heydrich as acting protector is noteworthy and is intended to conceal a complete change in the protectorates' status. Approximately, these two provinces may even become a region of Germany, the same as other political regions of Germany. Heydrich, known as "The Hangman", will be the head of this new region. It is believed that Germany's harsh oppression measures against Czechs are aimed at preparing for this new insult against the Czech state. According to Reuter's dispatch from the Swedish capital, a Berlin newspaper reported that Germany seems to be establishing a regime in the Czech protectorate similar to the "General Government" in Poland. As far as can be determined at this point, the current political system in the protectorate will come to an end.

The people's opposition to the occupying authorities is intensifying everywhere, and it appears that the people have secret paths to "other places."

He was speaking at the 64th annual meeting of the American Bar Association. He stated that if we want to prevent another world war from happening again, the high seas should be controlled by peace-loving and just powers - Britain and the U.S. - with no selfish desire for expansion. He said, "Frankly, we should unite our military strength and power with the military strength and power of another peace-loving great power, Britain, to stop aggression from causing global turmoil at its inception. I believe we will reach this by logic and by gradually recognizing its inevitability. We should have a period of interruption, during which we should not only work toward achieving peaceful goals but also prepare the necessary strength to force those who are unwilling to hold peace talks to accept peace. Other key points of Knox's speech called for implementing a complete military alliance with Britain, including the following points: (1) The U.S. should abandon its foolish idea of ​​not fighting unless attacked; (2) The U.S. does not have much time left to not fight. We should be determined to fight in other places outside our own land, because fighting far away is far better than fighting at home; (3) The British and U.S. navies are now clearing German pirates in the North Atlantic, resulting in the confinement of Nazi Germany on the railway; Germany will soon be destroyed within the ring of naval power; (4) Defeat totalitarian countries, the defeat of Nazism, I have no doubt, this is our national policy; (5) We are now only exerting a portion of our strength against the Nazis. We should not stop there. We should exert all or more of our strength to ensure that the sea lanes will be cleared in the future.

### Finance; Black Market Exchange in the Dark

Buyers Can't Buy...Sellers Can't Sell

Good for Intermediaries...Making Deals in Between

The black market is still active under open secrecy. This is certainly the way things are. But it is not open, which sometimes makes it impossible for buyers to buy and sellers to sell. Feeling around in the dark. This newspaper has long said that there will be unexpected gains. Black market exchanges sometimes cannot catch the right target because the buying and selling parties change. Good for intermediaries to make extra money. There is also a saying in the market that the freeze was originally to deal with that aspect. But the strange sayings are more and more. Quite a few people say that there is still a lot of foreign exchange coming in and out from that aspect. The most incomprehensible thing is that the four major banks still cannot control foreign exchange. According to people, the export foreign exchange passes through the hands of fourteen banks, and only legal currency is given. Then it is strange that the other exchanges cannot be collected.

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the central and HSBC listings are both flat. HSBC and other small counters handled a large number of settlement applications for this month. The black market was quiet, with little formal market conditions. Speculators had a lot of short-selling in the previous month, which was offset. The price turned to the bank was US$4.75.

### New Standards for Gold Futures; First Appearance; Shanghai Exchange Telegraphic Transfers Vary; Large Fluctuations in Market Prices

Yesterday's black market, the November futures began to appear using the Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange as the new standard for settlement. The market was lively, but the transmission of the Shanghai Exchange price into the market was not yet properly done. Industry operators inevitably had a hard time, causing market prices to fluctuate. A portion of scalpers have returned to the market to operate. In the future, these people will see those who are familiar with the Shanghai Exchange market prices, such as Xiangxingyong, Xianghe, and Zhongxing, as targets for following the trend. In the morning, because the private telephone Shanghai Exchange dropped from 185 yuan to 183.5 yuan, the buying trend was aroused, and the Western help also competed to enter. Therefore, from the morning opening of 7,540 yuan, it gradually flew up to 7,623 yuan. It slightly turned around at 5 quarters. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, the Shanghai rise code was 187 yuan, 3.5 yuan longer than the private telegraph. It opened low by 100 yuan in the selling trend for a while, at 7,510 yuan. The Hong Kong help bought in, and people's hearts began to settle down. It rose 60 yuan, and the market closed at 7,558 yuan. The hearts of all parties were quite unsteady. Cash transactions were thin and stable. Mingfeng entered Hesheng 30 taels, and Tianyuan and Yuxingyong each entered 10 taels. The price was all 9,300 yuan with few sellers. In the afternoon, Zhongxing entered Dafeng 50 taels, priced at 9,297 yuan. Shunyuan entered Xiangxingyong and Hongqing each 10 taels for 9,280 yuan, which ended up being the same as the closing price of the previous day. The same day was only 10 yuan higher, with more than 100 taels traded. The current price of the gold of cash number was 9,350 yuan, and the purchase was reduced by 200 yuan. The decorated gold was also sold that year.

Gold Futures Trading Turns Strong

Since 9:30 in the morning, the opening price of November gold futures was 7,540 yuan per bar (10 taels), sold by Xinyuan. They suddenly re-entered, and Ming, Xinfengyong, Dingsheng, Xiangxingyong, Yifeng, and others came in one after another. It immediately rose to 7,585 yuan, sold by Tianyuan and Xianghe. It went down to 7,570 yuan. Chengda, Xiangxingyong, Fukangyong, and Tianyuan bought in again, and the Shanghai exchange opened from 185 yuan to 183.5 yuan, and the price flew out of 7,600 yuan. Tianyuan entered 7,620 yuan, Yili and Xinyuan sold it out. It retreated to 7,620 yuan. At noon, Hongqingyong and Xinfengyong entered again, raising it to 7,623 yuan. Chengda and Da sold out, and the noon closing was 7,606 yuan. In the afternoon, the Shanghai exchange suddenly reported 187 yuan at 1:20, which was 3.5 yuan longer. People's hearts were greatly frustrated, and the price retreated wildly. The opening price at 1 o'clock was as low as 7,510 yuan, 94 yuan lower. Because Xianghe and Hengji each entered more than 100 taels, there were few treasure holders at the time, and the price flew up 60 yuan, and was stirred up to 7,570 yuan. It was sold by Da and Xiangxingyong at that time and dropped to 7,540 yuan. The closing price at 4:30 was 7,558. There was a high and low of 113 yuan that day.

### Cotton Yarn: Telegraphs of Orders from Southeast Asia Arrive in a Flurry; New Prices for "Double Horse" Brand Emerge Endlessly; Bears Can Only Pay High Prices for Overnight Swaps

The cotton yarn market, which had risen and then fallen the previous day, opened flat yesterday but then turned upward again. The rising momentum intensified, with new highs emerging continuously. This was due to continuous overseas transactions, with telegraphs of orders from Southeast Asia arriving in a flurry, causing the "Double Horse" factory's inventory to become increasingly tight. As a result, although the bears fought tirelessly, they felt a significant lack of chips. Recently, before the close of the market, the situation appeared quite weak. However, after the close, there was a sudden surge in prices, indicating the scarcity of warehouse receipts. Unable to cope, the bears had no choice but to seek overnight swaps at high prices. Given this, the market is unlikely to loosen. However, short sellers remain enthusiastic, believing that they can profit if the situation changes. As for Hong Kong traders, transactions were quieter. However, some say that spot goods are scarce in the market, and the factory has reduced production, resulting in weak output. The high price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 1,855 yuan, and the low price was 1,824 yuan. The opening was very firm in the early afternoon. Compared to the morning close, it suddenly rose seven or eight yuan to 1,848 yuan. However, floating shorts were still active, weakening to 1,843 yuan. But with tight warehouse receipts, it rose again to 1,852 yuan. Near the close, there were rumors that a certain speculator suddenly sold a huge amount of 4,000 to 5,000 bales, causing the price to fall to 1,840 yuan, but it was all bought up by large players. The closing price was 1,842 yuan. After the close, the bears lacked sufficient warehouse receipts, and the swap price was very high, reaching seven or eight jiao per piece, with many buyers competing. It rose again to 1,847 or 1,848 yuan. Today, 330 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped, and another 1,530 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong.

The "Double Horse" opening this morning was peaceful, with the initial price at 1,832 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1,835 yuan, but the trading was normal, and it loosened to 1,824 yuan. Subsequently, upon hearing that the cotton yarn market in the exchange was rising step by step, people's spirits were lifted. Those who usually shorted scrambled to cover their positions, and the market was driven upward, gradually rising to 1,855 yuan. However, a certain large player took profits on their long positions, and it loosened again to 1,841 yuan. But after the close, the public competed to buy, rising to 1,847 or 1,848 yuan. Statistics show that 15,020 bales were traded during the half-day. The amount bought by each group is listed below:

Southeast Asia: 20; Fellow Traders: 15,000

Total: 15,020

"Golden Double Horse" futures, with factory orders reportedly doing briskly, and rumors of lifting the ban and releasing goods causing a stir, trended high throughout the day. In particular, the squeeze on the current month seemed to be materializing. However, new shorts for the distant December contract were still quite active. The market atmosphere was not as enthusiastic as yesterday, mainly because factory orders were slightly firmer. The morning opening for October was 1,720 yuan, already up 10 yuan and 5 jiao from yesterday. After the initial auction, each month rose by about five or six yuan. October: 1,716 yuan and 5 jiao, November: 1,715 yuan, December: 1,750 yuan were the opening prices. In the second session, October continued to strengthen, rising to 1,720 yuan and 5 jiao. November then became brisk, with new buying pushing it up to 1,724 yuan. December remained strong, reaching 1,761 yuan. In the third session, the market atmosphere continued to rise, with the near-term October contract at 1,730 yuan and 5 jiao, and November at 1,733 yuan, the closing price for the morning session. December, however, fell back by three yuan, with a closing price of 1,758 yuan. In the two afternoon sessions, people's minds were very stable. They wanted to weaken but couldn't, and wanted to rise but lacked strength. After several complexities, there were general fluctuations of three to five yuan. October opened at 1,732 yuan and closed at 1,729 yuan. November opened at 1,735 yuan and closed at 1,732 yuan and 5 jiao. December opened at 1,760 yuan and closed at 1,758 yuan and 5 jiao. The highest price for the whole day was 1,734 yuan for October, 1,735 yuan for November, and 1,744 yuan for December. The total trading volume for the morning and afternoon sessions was over 15,000 bales, with October and December being particularly active. Compared to the previous day, October rose by 19 yuan and 5 jiao, November rose by 22 yuan, and December rose by 12 yuan. A table is listed below:

October November December

Comparison Up 9.5 Up 4.5 Up 3.0

### Cotton Prices Remain Firm and Brisk

Although trading in the spot cotton market is not active, prices remain firm and brisk, rising every day. The reason is that market inventories are thin, and the supply is uncertain. In particular, the price of coarse cotton has risen sharply, with 23-count American Pengjiapu cotton approaching 600 yuan. The price of "Fire Engine" cotton is 345 yuan, with 300 bales reportedly traded.

Brazilian Cotton: 125 pieces, 710.0 Jiaxin Second Factory

The New York cotton market rose due to European political news favoring the long side, as well as the strong rise in stocks on Wall Street. Traders and speculators actively bought in, and short covering was also very active. As a result, the closing price was about 14 or 15 points higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market was closed yesterday for a bank holiday. As for the forecast for the opening market today, it is expected to be one rupee higher due to the rise in cotton prices.

### Grains: New Rice Arrives Continuously, but Rice Prices Are Still Controlled

Yesterday, the rice market initially weakened and then rose, presenting a prosperous scene again. Initially, due to the weakening trend from the previous night, although there was some purchasing by traders, the market was difficult to recover. Moreover, with the official announcement that 58,000 bags of warehouse rice would be sold publicly at a low price of 110 yuan after ten days, and the wholesale price also reduced to 133 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen, and with 2,000 tons of publicly sold rice under negotiation, the market price was weak. Bank godown rice was officially sold at 115 yuan, and small godown rice was sold at 114 yuan by outside godowns. However, after the price weakened, traders seized the opportunity to buy at low prices, especially speculative groups, and skin ball trading was particularly active. The market immediately turned from weak to brisk. It was also heard that the telegraph price for small godown rice was 136 yuan, 1 jiao, 7 fen and 6 li, but it is difficult to predict whether it can be restored. Therefore, the market price immediately rose with people's spirits. Small Aya rice also reached 118 yuan and 5 jiao. It was slightly flat in the afternoon, and the closing price fell back by half a yuan. English-style spot goods were 139 yuan to 142 yuan and 7 jiao, secondary was 136 yuan and 5 jiao, and road rice was 145 yuan and 5 jiao. Compared to the previous market, it was generally larger by 23 yuan. 25,000 bags of spot rice and 1,000 tons of English-style rice were traded.

The prices of thick and thin, new and broken domestic rice varied yesterday. New rice from the South Port was in high demand, with prices continuing to rise by three or four yuan, opening at 150 yuan and then at 147 yuan. Thick broken rice from Wuxi was relatively old, so it was just average, still selling for 150 yuan. The arrival of new rice was slightly less than before, but the sales path was still smooth, so the price continued to depreciate. New Kunshan rice opened at 150 yuan, then at 147 yuan. New Dujian rice from Kunshan was already on the market yesterday, but the quantity was still small, only about thirty dan in total. The quality was good, so the sales were quite hot, opening at 127 yuan and 126 yuan and 5 jiao.

Glutinous rice was initially average, but later tightened with foreign rice. Both retail and wholesale were quite active, so the market was stronger than before, opening at 142 yuan for special Hong Kong glutinous rice, 140 yuan for ordinary glutinous rice, 138 yuan, 136 yuan for yellow second glutinous rice, 131 yuan for glutinous rice, and 130 yuan.

### Flour Stockpiling Does Not Decline; How Can Flour Prices Fall?

Foreign flour has arrived again. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 9,161 bags of flour from Hong Kong. It docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession to unload.

Yesterday's opening price of foreign flour was immediately snapped up by local traders who were stockpiling and taking advantage of low prices. Coupled with the recovery of foreign rice and the persistence of those holding goods, the market atmosphere in the morning was tense, so the opening price immediately rose by two or three jiao. Fort opened at 35 yuan and 5 fen, and Golden Dragon West Godown opened at 33 yuan and 5 fen. Subsequently, with undiminished buying interest and strong demand for transshipment, and with speculators further taking profits, although there were profitable long positions being released, prices continued to rise. Fort rose to 35 yuan and 3 jiao, West Godown Golden Dragon to 33 yuan and 6 jiao, rising to 33 yuan and 9 jiao. Five Swallow and Red Sun, which had been lowered by three or four jiao the day before and lacked buyers, were all sold at 34 yuan and 6 jiao yesterday. However, after a period of consolidation in the afternoon, the evening close was slightly flat. Fort closed at 35 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen, West Godown Golden Dragon at 33 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen, still better than the previous night by three or four jiao. Wheat inventories are low, and godown goods are still priced at 50 yuan.

### Oil Cake: 2,000 Pieces of Soybean Oil Arrive in Shanghai; Oil Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the speculative buying trend in the edible oil market, driven by rice merchants, foreign rice merchants, and yarn dealers, turned strong again. With rice prices rising and yarn prices increasing, rice and yarn merchants disregarded sales conditions and launched another round of price increases. As a result, vegetable oil and cottonseed oil futures were all raised by four or five yuan, and raw soybean oil and other oils also tightened. A total of over 100 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, nearly 1,000 dan of Daya Factory vegetable oil, and over 10,000 dan of Qing oil futures were sold. (Prices are detailed in the market price column)

In addition, 2,000 pieces of soybean oil were transported from Tianjin yesterday. Today, 250 pieces of soybean cake will be transported to...

### Sugar Market: Granulated Sugar Continues to Arrive in Shanghai; Sugar Prices Rise Again for No Reason

Taikoo car white B was 163 yuan, up 1 yuan. HX was 144 yuan, up 3 yuan. H car red was 126 yuan, up 7 yuan and 5 jiao compared to September 27th.

### Piece Goods: Southeast Asian Merchants and Dye Factories Scour the Market; Spot Goods of Eastern Fine Twill Rise Sharply; Sales Prices Rise Sharply by More Than Two Yuan

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market trend was firm, and people's minds were inclined towards rising prices. However, actual sales business for Southeast Asian and Hong Kong merchants was slightly dampened due to the lack of ships. Local shops were also sparse due to the approaching festival, while transactions between fellow traders and stockpilers were the most frequent. Sales prices for coarse and fine cloth twill rose by 5 jiao to 7 jiao and 5 fen per piece, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 5 jiao.

Eastern Cloth: Spot goods of fine twill rose the fastest, as Southeast Asian merchants and dye factories repeatedly searched the market. Goods were scarce, with each piece rising sharply by a huge amount of 2 yuan to 2 yuan and 5 jiao.

### Foreign Merchants Seek to Save Fuel; Advocate Continuous Office System

Lunch and rest times are canceled; Staff travel expenses can also be reduced

Police matters and Chinese banks are still difficult to adopt

The English-language Da Mei Evening News says that the office hours of some merchants in the city have implemented a one-shift method, that is, continuous office hours every day, canceling meal rest times, and finishing work early. It is heard that the American Chamber of Commerce also supports American firms in Shanghai to adopt this method, so as to save the city's fuel reserves this winter.

Some American Merchants Have Already Implemented

The secretary of the American Chamber of Commerce, Huo Si, has sent a letter to all members urging them to implement a one-shift method in their offices immediately. The letter briefly stated that in view of the necessity of saving coal reserves in the city this winter, the implementation of the one-shift method is very important. Some American businesses have already implemented this method. The office hours they have set are generally from 8:00 am to 1:00 pm. However, other merchants can imitate this and choose appropriate hours to achieve the same savings effect. The board of directors of the American Chamber of Commerce proposed a suggestion at a meeting a few days ago and considered this matter, which was unanimously approved.

Police Matters Are Difficult to Adopt

According to a spokesman for the Public Works Department's reply to reporters, the board of directors of the bureau has not discussed this matter. Changing office hours may reduce the fuel expenditure of merchants, but the bureau must maintain necessary services such as police and fire protection, so it is difficult to take this measure. It is heard that the Shanghai branches of large commercial firms such as Mobil Oil Company and British American Tobacco Company have started the one-shift work method. It is expected that other American firms will also change their current office hours after the Chamber of Commerce discusses it.

Chinese Banks Are Expected to Reject

However, Chinese banks are expected to reject this matter, while foreign banks and brokers may continue to work during normal winter hours. According to various opinions, the effect of changing office hours to a one-shift method will greatly reduce fuel consumption this winter, and commercial firm employees will also benefit from it, because those who usually travel back and forth twice a day will only need to travel once, saving half of their travel expenses.

British Chamber of Commerce to Meet Today

The British Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to hold a meeting this afternoon (2nd) to discuss one-shift office hours, so as to save fuel and enable employees to save on travel expenses. This proposal, if decided, will be reported by the president of the Chamber of Commerce, Marshall, to be adopted by British commercial firms in the port. Although it cannot be determined what kind of office hours are applicable to general positions, it is believed that this proposal will be welcomed. American commercial firms have implemented a one-shift office system, and the hours they use are generally from 8:00 am to 1:00 pm. The vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce, Ni Gu'er, said that these hours may not be applicable to some companies, but other hours may be adopted, as long as they are in line with the principle of saving.

### The Whole City Prepares to Warmly Celebrate the Double Tenth Festival; Suspend Flags and Take a Holiday to Promote the Economy and Disaster Relief Movement

October 10th is the National Day anniversary of the Great Republic of China. The people of all walks of life in the city do not intend to be extravagant due to the special environment of Shanghai. They decided to suspend flags and take a holiday as usual, and enthusiastically promote the Great Movement. The details are recorded as follows:

The Whole City Suspends Flags to Extend Celebrations Together

All organs, groups, schools, post offices, customs, factories, shops, and households in the city have decided to hang the Qing Tian Bai Ri flag uniformly for one day and take a holiday to celebrate, in accordance with the flag-hanging measures agreed upon by various public groups and the concession authorities, in order to commemorate the Double Tenth National Day. However, as it is a time of crisis and national disasters are rampant, they are following the central government's order and will not hold grand celebrations. Each school will hold commemorative ceremonies separately. In addition to suspending flags and taking holidays to celebrate, the embassies and consulates of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France stationed in Shanghai, as well as the concession authorities, will also hang flags on foreign ships docked in the Huangpu River to celebrate.

Offering Money for Disaster Relief to Be Promoted Separately

In order to celebrate the National Day, all walks of life in the city have launched four major movements to express the patriotic enthusiasm of the entire city: (1) continuing to offer money, (2) donating money in lieu of winter clothes, (3) saving money for disaster relief, (4) national construction savings. All fundraising aspects will be promoted separately by each industry. After the funds are collected, they will be sent to the designated receiving agencies for submission to the central government or charitable organizations for distribution.

Early Account Settlement and Joint Defense

The police authorities of the two concessions, in view of the Double Tenth National Day being a great revolutionary anniversary in China, and connected to the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar, in order to ensure the safety of the area, have decided to implement joint security starting from the 4th (because the 5th is the Mid-Autumn Festival account settlement period). In addition to prohibiting all gatherings, associations, parades, and demonstrations, they will strictly enforce curfew laws and order all detectives to be dispatched to protect account settlement and ensure a peaceful passage through this revolutionary anniversary. The defense forces of various countries and the International Settlement Volunteers will assist the concession authorities in security as needed.

### Importers Apply for Foreign Exchange and Provide Guarantees

The foreign exchange measures of the Exchange Equalization Fund will remain largely unchanged in October. However, there will be improvements in the procedures to ensure strictness. In the past, applications for foreign exchange to the Exchange Equalization Fund were submitted by banks on behalf of importers. From now on, the importer must fill out the application form in person, which will be submitted by the bank to the Exchange Equalization Fund with a guarantee clause. In addition to requiring the applicant to provide various documents, if the Exchange Equalization Fund finds that the imported goods do not match those stated in the application, the importer is willing to sell all of the foreign exchange obtained from the Exchange Equalization Fund back to the Exchange Equalization Fund at the exchange rate at the time of purchase.

Application Forms Will Be Standardized

In the past, there were three types of application forms, and the paper color was different because each bank printed them themselves. In the future, they will be unified into two types, all using white paper, in four copies. Three copies will be sent to the Exchange Equalization Fund, and one copy will be kept by the bank. For items that comply with the first two requirements, that is, goods allowed to be imported in Schedules A and B, and minor imported items not listed in Schedules A and B and the list of prohibited imported items, the first type will be used when applying for foreign exchange. The second type will be used for personal remittances, travel expenses, and insurance premiums when applying for foreign exchange. In the first type, items D and E in section 5 originally only needed to state the country of production and manufacture and the country from which they were imported. In the future, the place of manufacture and shipment and the manufacturer must be clearly stated. Currently, the foreign banks are being printed by the Maxxley Bank, and the Chinese banks are being printed by the Bank of China, according to the form set by the Exchange Equalization Fund. After printing, the two banks will distribute them to other banks for use. In general, all banks can follow the procedures starting next Monday.

Business Representatives Go to Hong Kong

The Zi Lin West News reported that regarding the foreign exchange issue, it is recently learned that many business representatives from the Wood Port have left Shanghai for Hong Kong. The most encouraging ones are several representatives from the insurance and silk cloth industries. It is learned that all merchants in the port applying for foreign exchange have been approved, except for those who have been rejected for non-compliance. In the past few days, export trade from the port to the Dutch East Indies has been very active, especially the export of cloth, which is a large amount. There are many export bills of exchange, and it is expected that the tension in foreign exchange will soon ease.

### Gausm's Whereabouts

French Ambassador to China Gausm returned to Shanghai by boat from Beiping last Sunday morning. Accompanying him was French Embassy Counselor to China, Castile. Castile will stay in Shanghai for a short period of time, but the future whereabouts of the French Ambassador will be to Ping or the wartime capital of China, but it is still unknown. However, as Gausm has been away from Chongqing for a long time, it is possible that he will go to Chongqing. However, according to the Zi Lin West News, the French Ambassador will remain in Shanghai for a week and then return to Beiping. The French Embassy is unwilling to disclose the Ambassador's future whereabouts.

### High Tide in Huangpu River Tomorrow

There will be a high tide in the Huangpu River starting tomorrow, which will be larger than previous ones. The predicted quantity is around 13 feet. At that time, low-lying roads will see tidal waters surging again. Also, one of the Pacific hurricanes is trending towards Hong Kong, but the progress is winding and may dissipate. The other direction has turned and will approach Kyushu, Japan. Shanghai can avoid the attack.

### Restrictions on Travelers to Hong Kong Carrying Money

It has recently been learned from shipping circles in the port that the Hong Kong government will set a new limit on the amount of various currencies that travelers to Hong Kong can carry. It is heard that each traveler is only allowed to carry the equivalent of five hundred pounds upon landing.

### Japanese Control of Export Trade Shows Flexibility; Threatens to Shift Based on the Attitude of Britain and the United States; This Principle Applies to Shanghai as Well

The Times reported that a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in the port stated at a Japanese press briefing yesterday to foreign journalists that the Japanese control over American export trade in the occupied areas (including Shanghai) is now showing a tendency to ease. This was the spokesman's answer to a question from an American journalist. The reporter quoted recent figures released by the US authorities, showing that American export trade from Tianjin totaled $200,000 for the entire month of August and $600,000 for the month of September up to the 25th. The reporter asked the spokesman to explain whether this was due to the Japanese easing of trade controls in Tianjin. The spokesman replied that there were many factors involved in this issue, and any progress in trade was not necessarily due to the easing of control regulations. However, it can be said that the control measures are now showing a tendency to ease. The control regulations have flexibility and largely depend on the actions taken by Britain and the United States in the Far East. The spokesman then answered the reporter's question with a "long-term vision," stating that trade control depends on the relationship between Britain and the United States and the entire Far East. Therefore, his remarks on the easing of trade control also apply to Shanghai.

### American Film Industry Representative Goes to Hong Kong to Discuss Obtaining Foreign Exchange; Haig Will Meet with Fox After Arriving in Hong Kong

It has recently been learned that Haig, President of Asia Theatres Corporation, representing the American film distribution companies and theater companies in the city, has set off for Hong Kong to discuss with Falker and other members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee in order to obtain sufficient foreign exchange so that the American film distributors here can

Remit Funds to the United States

The General Manager of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation in Shanghai, and Chairman of the Chinese Film Merchants Association, Babu, stated this morning (1st) that the result of Haig's discussions with the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee is of great importance. The film distributors here have telegraphed the New York headquarters about this matter, fearing that if the funds cannot be remitted to New York, then there will be

No New Films Coming

to China. If the Exchange Equalization Fund does not allow the film companies to remit foreign exchange to the United States, then this matter will not only affect Shanghai but also the whole of China, including Hong Kong. Haig left Shanghai for Hong Kong two days ago on the President Asia, and is expected to arrive there in the next two days.

### Sale of Public Rice: Registration Required

The Rice Public Warehouse Management Committee has decided to entrust the sale of over 58,000 bags of the second batch of public warehouse rice to various rice shops within the two concessions at prevailing market prices. It is learned that all rice shops can send personnel with their company chop to the industry association to register starting from the 3rd of this month, fill out subscription forms, and the association will issue payment slips. Rice shops can use this slip to directly make payments at the Fuyuan Money Exchange on Ningbo Road in the Public Concession and exchange them for delivery orders. The payment date is limited to within five days from the date of registration, and delivery will be in the order of payment receipt.

Rice Industry Announcement

The Rice Shop Industry Association yesterday announced to the rice market that they had received notification from the Shanghai Rice Public Warehouse Management Committee to designate member rice shops to sell over 50,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice on their behalf. The regulation sets the price for rice shops at 133 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen per bag (including the bag, 234 pounds), equivalent to 107 yuan per stone. The rice shops are not allowed to sell to consumers for more than 110 yuan per stone (net weight 160 jin). All rice shops must start selling from their stores at 9:00 AM on October 11th. This low-price sale of warehouse rice aims to benefit ordinary people. Therefore, the sale of rice is mainly for retail consumers, and each household cannot purchase more than one stone. We have copied the brief rules for the first low-price sale of warehouse rice and requested notification to member rice shops for subscription, etc. The association convened a meeting of directors and supervisors and resolved to allocate this public warehouse rice to member rice shops in the concessions for sale. Registration will be handled by the association first. The registration dates are set as follows: (1) October 3rd for member rice shops in the Public Concession; (2) October 4th for member rice shops in the French Concession; (3) October 5th for member rice shops in the Hongkou District; (4) October 6th for member rice shops in the West Shanghai District. The quantities of warehouse rice for sale are divided into three types: 100 bags, 50 bags, and 25 bags. If there are no retail facilities, no allocation will be made and it will be recorded. All member rice shops in the concession districts are requested to check the above dates, send personnel with their chops to the association to complete the registration procedures from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM each day. The deadline will be strictly enforced, please do not delay. Furthermore, when the warehouse rice is sold out, the empty bags belong to the rice shops. Rice shops selling the rice must establish a separate warehouse rice ledger to record the quantity of low-price warehouse rice sold each day and the exact amount of legal tender received in detail. Even if only one jin of rice is sold, and the legal tender received is only a few jiao, it must be clearly recorded separately for the public warehouse association to inspect.

### American Wheat Aids Haining Disaster: First Two Batches Already Distributed

The American Red Cross's wheat assistance to China: Fellow Haining natives in Shanghai stated that after the military disasters in various towns and villages of the county, followed by drought and flood disasters, and this year affected by wind and rain, most of the disaster victims are struggling on the brink of starvation. Therefore, they initially obtained 1,000 bags of relief wheat from the Shanghai representative of the American Red Cross. With the assistance of American Pastor George of the Jiaxing Jesus Church and Reverend Ye Ruishan of the church, they went to various districts in Haining, including Xie Guo, Zhou Chang, Yuan Xia, and Yuan Dong, to conduct on-site investigations and distribute to extremely poor households. However, due to the large number of disaster victims, the relief was insufficient. A second batch of 3,000 bags of American wheat was obtained and distributed under the direction of Pastor Hua. The results of the investigation showed that Yuanhua Town suffered the most severe military disaster, unmatched in Zhejiang Province. Reverend Ye Ruishan and others witnessed the severity of the disaster. Therefore, 680 bags of the second batch of American wheat were allocated to Yuanhua Town and surrounding areas, including Pu [], in conjunction with local Pastor Zhang Yinsheng to distribute relief in Yuanhua Town and surrounding areas, including Pu [ ]. However, the coastal residents along the 60 li embankment inside and outside the Jiucang were also extremely poor and are still planning to distribute to save those on the verge of death, but there are only a few dozen bags of relief wheat left.

It set sail south on the morning of the day before yesterday, heading to Manila via Hong Kong. The ship carried 150 US Navy soldiers who had completed their service in the East, including 100 soldiers from the US 4th Marines stationed in Shanghai. According to reports, the Henderson was originally scheduled to arrive around September 1st to transport US military officials evacuated from Japan, but after passing Wusong, it sailed directly to Qinhuangdao and docked on the coast of North China. After the ship left, the US Navy Asiatic Fleet's Shanghai-based shallow-water gunboat Luzon set sail at around 10:00 AM yesterday, heading to the Yangtze River for patrol.

Tailuo Vessel Arrives Yesterday

The American President Lines world-class mail ship Tailuo, newly arrived in Shanghai from San Francisco, USA, entered the Wusongkou at 12:30 PM yesterday. The company's passenger tender arrived at the dock at 2:00 PM. The vessel came directly from San Francisco and Honolulu and will stay in Shanghai for 24 hours. It is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong, Manila, and Singapore at 6:30 PM today. From Singapore, it will return to Shanghai and the United States along the original route.

After arriving in Shanghai, the ship planned to export goods to Hong Kong and Bangkok. Regarding the issue of the detention, the company claims that the goods do not contain any prohibited items, and the company is currently negotiating with the Jianghai Customs. (It is said that an agreement has been reached and it is hoped that the ship will continue sailing south in the next few days.)

### Bombing Case on Henry Road: Gangsters Mistake the Victim: Aim Was to Intimidate Tao Zuichou

The residence at No. 1, Lane 34, Henry Road, French Concession, the home of Tao Jiwei, a former employee of the Hongkou Branch of the Bank of Communications, was the target of a small hand grenade placed by gangsters. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the purpose of the bombing was to intimidate Tao Zuichou, a comprador for the Hongyun Shipping Bureau. Because Tao also resides near the address, the gangsters who threw the bomb mistakenly believed that Tao Jiwei's residence was Tao Zuichou's residence, deliberately throwing the bomb to intimidate him and extort money. After the incident, the police conducted an investigation and, because the letter inside the paper wrapping of the bomb mentioned Tao Zuichou, summoned Tao Zuichou for detailed questioning in order to find clues to arrest the gangsters.

### US Efforts on National Defense Program: Talk with Bode Back in Shanghai

Mr. Bode, Registrar of St. John's University, returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon on the Tailuo ship from the United States. According to a reporter, the American people are increasingly interested in the Chinese question and are particularly concerned about the current situation in China. Therefore, when he lectured on the Chinese question on the West Coast of the United States, he was very well received by the audience. Mr. Bode was accompanied by 81 people, including Mr. Norden, principal of St. John's Middle School, and Professor Seleven of economics. According to Seleven, in recent months, due to the implementation of various national defense programs in the United States, the cost of living for the people has also been increasing daily. For example, in the area of Dede Li, due to the development of military industries, other industries have been greatly affected, and the local situation has also changed. At present, American youth must undergo one year of military training, which has resulted in a 25% decrease in university students. The automobile industry has been most affected by military industries, with factories focusing on the production of military supplies, resulting in a significant reduction in automobile production.

### Lunhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory Manager Wu Bonian Kidnapped: Four Gangsters Wait on the Road to Intercept the Car: The Driver is Expelled and the Gangsters Drive the Car Away

Yesterday morning, four kidnappers on Ningbo Road and Fujian Road in the Public Concession kidnapped the manager of a dyeing and weaving factory. At the time, both the person and the car were kidnapped. The detailed information about the case is recorded below:

Served as Manager

The Lunhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory in this city is very large in scale and has been established for many years. The factory address is located at Nos. 3, 4, and 5, Qunyi Fang, Lane 446, Ningbo Road, with an attached business department. There is also a second factory located at No. 558 Haifang Road, also with an attached business department. Wu Bonian, a native of Ningbo, serves as the manager. Wu lives in the main factory and has a car with license plate No. 810 for transportation, driven by the driver Chen Mei Wang (a native of Ningbo).

Four Gangsters Kidnap

Yesterday morning at 11:30 AM, Wu took the car from the main factory to the second factory on Haifang Road to work. Unexpectedly, as the car slowly turned at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Fujian Road, four kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Two of the gangsters held pistols, stepped forward to block the way, and after some intimidation, they successively jumped into the car, forcing Chen to drive east and flee to Huankou Road towards the Bund. The driver Chen Mei Wang was expelled on the Bund, and the gangsters drove away themselves, and their whereabouts are unknown.

Fled South

After the incident, Chen returned to the factory to report and reported the situation to the police in charge, requesting them to investigate the whereabouts. The police received the news and immediately sent detectives to the scene to investigate. They also took the driver Chen Mei Wang to the police station to inquire about the circumstances of the incident and ordered him to strictly investigate the traces of the gangsters. It is reported that after the gangsters kidnapped the victim, they drove to the Bund and seemed to have fled south without a trace. Therefore, the police have been making every effort to investigate along this line and have notified the French police to pay attention to the traces of the car.

### Xie Da Xiang Silk Fabric Store Thrown Two Bombs

The Xie Ren Xiang Silk Fabric Store, a branch of the Great World, located at No. 25 Mintini Yin Road, French Concession, was suddenly attacked by two sulfur bombs thrown inside at around 7:30 PM last night. For a time, thick smoke filled the air, and pedestrians and customers in the store were shocked and fled in panic. After the police received the news, they sent a police car to arrest the perpetrators, but they were nowhere to be found.

### High-Priced Search for Nickel Coins: Russian Man Deceived and Case Solved

Most hardware items are related to military use, so there are many people looking for them on the market, resulting in prices soaring day by day. Recently, some people have also been purchasing nickel coins of 20 points, 10 points, and 5 points that were previously circulating on the market at high prices. Five 20-point nickel coins can be exchanged for as much as 8 or 9 yuan in legal tender. In addition to searching everywhere,

High-Priced Purchase

What is the purpose of these people is difficult for outsiders to know in detail. In addition to the Chinese, there are also Russians involved in this business. A Russian named Bao Lisuofu, who lives at No. 239 Hamilton Building, Fuzhou Road, is one of the people engaged in this business. Recently, through the introduction of Shan Tong Ji Bian Dakefu, he purchased 700 pounds of nickel coins from Cheng Mao Money Shop at No. 266 Zhejiang Road.

Unit Price Per Pound

Was 82 yuan in legal tender, totaling 57,400 yuan. However, recently, it was discovered that it contained 330 pounds of copper pieces, and the market price of these copper pieces is only 3 yuan 5 jiao per pound, and the estimated loss is 27,060 yuan. Bao reported this to the Central Police Station, and Chinese Detective Chen Yonggui and Detective Mao Yunlong.

Under Investigation

First, Bian Dakefu was arrested, and then Zhu Sixian (accountant of Shen Da Cheng), Zhang Xianji, and Yang Liang, who acted as intermediaries, were arrested at Shen Da Cheng Dim Sum Shop at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road and Room 317 of the Daran Hotel at No. 317 Zhifu Road. Hu Shunfu and Jin Aisheng were also arrested at Cheng Mao Money Shop, while the owner of the shop, Wang Bosheng, and the accountant Chen Zhichang, are both at large. Yesterday morning,

The Arrested Criminals

Were sent to the Fifth Criminal Division of the Special Court. Police Lawyer Qian Xunji stated that the case still needs to be investigated and the accomplices need to be arrested, so he requested permission to temporarily detain them and reschedule the interrogation. After Judge Meng Tingke interrogated them, he ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the interrogation.

### New Blood Transfusion Method

— Suitable for All

Since the invention of blood transfusions, countless people suffering from excessive blood loss due to accidental injuries have been saved, and countless dying anemic patients have been able to continue their lives. This is one of the great contributions of the medical community in the past.

However, based on the clinical experiments of many medical experts over the past few decades, it is felt that the application of blood transfusions cannot be popularized. The reasons for this are probably twofold: First, the source of blood comes from another person, and in today's money-oriented world, the value of blood is quite expensive (approximately 20 yuan for 100 c.c.); many poor patients often die because they cannot afford to buy blood. Second, there is the limitation of time: Often, when patients with acute illnesses need blood, it is quite difficult to find a suitable person for transfusion within a certain time. Although organizations such as blood transfusion companies have recently been established to remedy this second shortcoming, it remains a serious problem in remote and inaccessible areas. In order to avoid the above two inconveniences, many medical experts are working daily to improve the situation. Recently, Dr. Xu Bao Yi, a professor at Aurora University Medical College, and his medical students have found a suitable and reasonable method, which is the new blood transfusion method I am going to discuss.

This method is exactly the same as surgery and intravenous injection. As for the source of blood, it does not come from another person, but is taken from the umbilical cord connecting the mother and the baby immediately after birth. This is undoubtedly a new discovery in the Chinese medical community.

Originally, when the fetus is in the mother's placenta, its nutrition is entirely supplied by the mother's blood through the umbilical cord. After the baby is born, the blood in the umbilical cord near the baby's head gradually coagulates, and the blood near the placenta also begins to coagulate. At this time, the placenta has not yet fallen off, and there is still some blood in the umbilical cord. At this time, wash the outer part of the umbilical cord with medicinal liquid, and then make a small cut in the umbilical cord to allow the blood that is about to coagulate to flow into a small bottle. Then, filter the blood in the bottle once and then test whether it contains bacteria. After testing, if there are no bacteria in the blood, then test the blood type (Groupesanguin) and put the same blood types together for application.

When blood is collected in this way, adding several chemical agents can prevent it from coagulating immediately. The composition of these chemical agents is as follows:

Serum Physiologigu e sale. 1000c.c.

Citrate de soude 105g.

Glucose 0.5cg.

Sulganilamide 1,5g.

If this blood is stored in a refrigerator, it can be preserved for up to fifteen days (this is the current situation, and the date may be extended in the future). When a patient needs a blood transfusion, inject the blood of the same type as the patient into a vein. Therefore, the operation is not necessarily troublesome, but the two difficulties mentioned earlier have been solved. The detailed method of collecting blood will be published in the upcoming Aurora Medical Journal for the reference of all medical experts.

To date, dozens of patients have been saved by Dr. Xu's injection of this type of blood. The patients are in very good condition after the blood transfusion and have no adverse reactions. Therefore, there is no doubt that this method will be adopted by medical experts in the near future.

Recently, Dr. Xu is leading students from Aurora University Medical College in researching the relationship between umbilical cord blood and maternal and infant blood. When this problem is solved, we can have a better understanding of the distribution of different blood types between mother and child or father and child.

Historical Talk

### Xie Zhi

— Zhu Yu

(New Interpretations of Master Ai, Part Six)

Our country has many legendary monsters, such as the Bo Yi, the Yang, the nine-tailed fox, the four-eared beast, the eye on the back; the Ya Yu, like a horse, naked with a human face and horse feet; the Fu Xi, like a rooster, with a human face; the Suan Yu, like a snake, with four wings and six eyes, and three legs; the Jian Guo, with one body and nine heads, nine tails, and bristling fur… If they were still alive, we would probably be too scared to go out. The Xie Zhi described in this article is one of them.

The Xie Zhi is similar in shape to a monster called the Qilin, except that it has a hard and sharp horn on its head. Those who have seen ancient dramas know that the animal painted on the walls of government offices and embroidered in the center of officials' robes is the Xie Zhi. What is the origin of this? Listen on…

One day, King Xuan of Qi asked Master Ai, "Haven't we often heard of this strange beast called the Xie Zhi? What exactly is it?"

Master Ai thought that King Qi had other intentions, so he hesitated and said, "Your humble servant… does not know."

"Oh," King Qi said, "I'm just asking! Ai Qing, you are a smart and knowledgeable person, you must know. Hmm, are there any Xie Zhi now?"

When Master Ai saw that King Qi's expression was normal, he replied, "There were Xie Zhi in the time of Yao, but they have all been killed now. Your servant has read in ancient books that Emperor Yao's court must have kept a Xie Zhi. This creature was very strange. It knew who among the officials had evil intentions, greed, or a black heart, and it would use the horn on its head to kill that person and eat him on the spot, without fail."

"So it is the son of the god of justice? It is a pity that they have all been killed!" King Qi nodded.

"Yes! If we kept a Xie Zhi now, it wouldn't be as hungry as it was in Yao's time. It would probably be so full that it wouldn't even need Your Majesty to buy fodder for it." Master Ai laughed, and King Qi also laughed.

Xie Zhi, noble Xie Zhi, when will you be resurrected?

### Wake-Up Telegram

— Xin Liang

Not long ago, Western Union in the United States launched a novel service - the wake-up telegram. For people who like to sleep late in the morning, Western Union has finally come up with this method. The procedure is to specify a time and have a messenger deliver a telegram in the early morning. Friends who sleep late will wake up immediately when they hear that a telegram has arrived, if they did not already know about this wonderful plan. Even if they later learn the secret, the telegraph office has also thought of a plan. The bureau will send "wake-up telegrams" every fifteen minutes, one after another, which will eventually annoy those "sleepyheads" so much that they will no longer want to go back to bed.

Generally speaking, the purpose of the "wake-up telegram" is indeed very good. Moreover, the method is so simple. Here, I sincerely hope with all my heart that this business will soon be extended to China, especially to several major cities such as Shanghai, so that those friends who "don't want to get up early" can also appreciate the beauty of the early morning and realize the value of time.

### Poverty and Shame

— Yi Wu

Poor people should not be ashamed of being poor, because poverty is not an evil thing.

If a person does an evil deed, or even a slightly evil deed, his heart will feel uneasy; he will feel sorry for others, and even more sorry for himself. A pure heart will feel that there is a stain on it. Only then should he be ashamed.

Therefore, if a person does not do evil, but is simply ashamed of being poor, it is meaningless and incorrect. Only doing evil is worth feeling ashamed of.

Twelve Unexpected Storms

"Brother, we have been old neighbors for many years. I hope you can be generous!" Old Manager Meng said in a pitiful manner, "The previous things were really all the fault of my harmful uncle. Please forgive me for the sake of our brotherhood! Tomorrow, I will definitely go to Beijing to find him. In a month at most, and twenty days at the least, I will definitely bring Miss Mei Bao back."

When Old Meng said this, Qiu Haitang almost laughed out loud.

"But, Brother Wu," he said, his expression becoming more and more sincere. "Please, please help me to find Lin Sheng back too! I dare not ask you to find him back before I leave, maybe you still can't believe me; but I hope you can get him back in three or four days, first because I only have one son, and I can't be without support when I get old, and second, once I leave tomorrow, there will be no one to take care of the house, so I really can't delay any longer!"

This move was of course anticipated by Yu Kun, but he didn't expect Old Meng to wake up so quickly.

"Thank you very much, Old Man Meng!" Qiu Haitang also hurriedly cupped his hands at him and said, "Your kindness is truly appreciated. I will entrust my daughter's matter to you! Since you are helping me so much, how can I refuse the young manager's matter? But..." (226) "Madam, please do a good deed: my child is dying of illness!"

Entertainment World

### Watching Su Shaoqing Perform "Hongyang Cave"

— Fan Shi Ren

The China Charity Relief Association invited famous amateur performers from Shanghai to perform at the Lyceum Theatre one day to raise funds. The famous Pingju opera artist Su Shaoqing was invited to participate in the main play. Although this man is a veteran in the amateur opera world, he has rarely been seen on stage in recent years. This time, he was said to have agreed to come because he could not refuse the righteous cause, and he met us on the red carpet with his well-studied Tan School's famous play "Hongyang Cave".

The reporter braved the rain to go there at around 9 o'clock, and saw that the usually desolate Lyceum Theatre was suddenly crowded with cars and horses, an unprecedented scene. At that time, the stage was showing a banquet of courtiers, with Zhang Zhixiang playing Mi Heng, singing and reciting flawlessly. After that, it was Huang Jingbo's daughter being escorted. Because the play was too crowded that day, although he tried his best to move forward, Su's play did not appear on the stage until 10:45 amidst the anticipation of the audience, who responded with warm applause, and then immediately held their breath to listen to this high mountain and flowing water music. Every sentence and every word of Su's singing could be heard clearly. If his mouth skills were not top-notch, how could he achieve this? Su's singing and pronunciation have been refined, and in recent years, he has entered a state of perfection. He is not only round and steady, but also good at using the four tones without being restricted by them, which hinders the melody. This point is admirable. As for the clear and elegant voice, it can indeed give people an aesthetic feeling in hearing. In summary, from the beginning of stealing the bones to the end of the illness, the entire play was not sloppy at all, and he tightly grasped the emotions of the characters in the play from beginning to end, which was convincing. The large section of Erhuang Sanyan when he saw the Wise King was sung in a sad and mournful tone, as if weeping and complaining, making people's noses tingle. I am afraid that the old Tan of the year did not sing this any better.

The big-faced Meng Liang who played with Su was the famous Jing amateur Zhang Zhesheng, whose voice was as loud as a bell and whose structure was stable. He is indeed a Jin Shaoshan in the amateur world. The person who played the Qin for Su was the famous Qin amateur Jin Shaogang. Some people have praised Jin as the number one rising star in playing Lao Sheng Jinghu in Shanghai's amateur opera world in recent years, which is no accident. With such skill, it is no wonder that Su relies on him as a green leaf to set off the peony.

### About "The Gold Rush"

— Gu Sheng

"The Gold Rush," performed by the Tianfeng Drama Society, is a new type of comedy. The reporter was pleased to read the script of the play first, and is pleased to report to the readers first:

Comedy is not easy to create, and comedy is even more difficult. First, it must give a strong satire and portrayal of the existing ridiculous reality, and find its type, and then appropriately emphasize and exaggerate these types to make people laugh, but in addition to laughter, there is still a deep thought, which we can find in Chaplin's "Modern Times" and "City Lights", and we can also see it in "The Gold Rush". It uses a simple story as an introduction, on the one hand, it depicts the ridiculous, pitiful and hateful speculators, hoarders, troublemakers and small businessmen who fuel the flames as the warp, and on the other hand, it portrays the fashion, hypocrisy and deception of Shanghai people as the weft, thus unfolding a series of jokes.

I met several familiar characters in this play, so there is no need to complain about the author, but the cruel reality should be blamed. It made the characters in the play appear on stage, let everyone laugh and open their appetite and eat three more bowls of rice (unfortunately the price of rice is too expensive), which is good for health. Let's take a look at these characters in the play, here are the villagers who came to the city, the antique gentry Mr. Ma Jinshi, who always says "zhizhu zheye", because he heard that Shanghai is full of gold, so he came to Shanghai to "dig gold". There is also the treasure of our ancient China, a country squire whose eyes are full of Zhuge Liang and Sima Yi, and whose mouth is full of young masters and young ladies. There is also a Shanghai young master, a fashionable lady, a cheater, and a gambler. The reporter thinks that we have shed too many tears in our time, and now we need laughter, we need strong laughter, from laughter we can gain the power of rebirth.

### "Home" Movie Story (8)

— Zhou Yibai

Not long after the death of Master Gao, Gao Keming and other elder brothers quarreled and divided the family. Seeing that this large family was on the verge of collapse, Juewei had the intention of seeking other development. At this time, Juewei's wife, Li Ruijue, was pregnant and about to give birth, and Master Gao's concubine, Aunt Chen, thought that Master Gao's coffin was still in the house, and no one could give birth, saying that it would make the dead uneasy in the afterlife. So she forced Juewei to find another house for Ruijue to live in. Although Juewei knew that this was a ridiculous superstition, he had no way to resist, so he had to patiently discuss with Ruijue and find another small house outside the city to move Ruijue to. Although Ruijue was very unwilling, she had to submit to her husband's weakness and incompetence. And Aunt Chen thought that Juewei was in mourning and should not meet with the parturient. Therefore, when Ruijue was about to give birth, the servant girl accompanying her also blocked Juewei outside the door, not allowing them to meet. As a result, Ruijue, due to internal and external attacks, died of blood loss after the baby was born.

At this time, the once-powerful Gao family had fallen apart and disintegrated. Seeing this dilapidated scene, Juewei could no longer bear it, so he had to abandon this large family that had lived together for generations and seek other development elsewhere.

At the moment when Juewei boarded the boat to leave, Juemin and Yunhua came to see him off. Yunhua said: "Soon, we will follow in your footsteps and go to other places." (The End)

Chapter 17: In a fit of anger for beauty

Zhang Cangbai was very depressed, so he ran to the Right Army camp with Chen Fei to meet Xu Jing and Liu Yinying. They went out of the camp and sat on the ground in a pine forest under a hillside to talk. Zhang Cangqiu said to Xu Jing, "Brother Xu, I have been feeling bloated these days, I can't eat, and I can't wait to fly to Beijing, cut Li Chuang in half with one knife, and quell the chaos for the country. I don't know what medicine General Wu is selling in his gourd by stationing his troops here without moving. The day before yesterday, I had already asked Defender Ma Bao to urge General Wu to quickly kill to Beijing to avenge the emperor. But the news is silent and has always been stagnant here, how can it not be depressing? General Wu was originally ordered to deploy troops to the pass to guard the capital. Now that the capital has been lost, he is watching and not moving forward. Is it because Emperor Chongzhen is dead and the Ming Dynasty is considered dead? How can we soldiers stand by and watch and not have the heart to save? So I came to visit you, let's discuss and discuss; should we go to see General Wu in person and urge him to march quickly? If he doesn't go, I, Lao Zhang, will kill to Beijing alone. Brother Xu, isn't it? "Xu Jing listened and clapped his hands and praised," Brother Zhang said it so straightforwardly! We will kill the thieves with one heart, and we will not hesitate. But in my opinion, General Wu's heart is a little shaken. I don't know why he didn't continue to set off immediately? This morning, I heard people say that General Wu's father, Wu Xiang, had sent a letter. General Wu kept it secret and sent people to Beijing to inquire about the news. A person cannot be known, maybe General Wu's heart is a little shaken." (183)
