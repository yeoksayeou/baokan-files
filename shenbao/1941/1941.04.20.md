### U.S. Government Approves Materials for China Aid, Mechanical Supplies to Ship Soon; Hu Shih Visits U.S. Authorities to Discuss New Situation, Stresses Chinese Government Will Continue to Fight

Washington - President Roosevelt stated today while receiving reporters that the U.S. government has approved aid to China in the form of materials under the Lend-Lease Act. However, the President did not specify whether the aid materials had already been shipped, nor the types of materials approved for shipment to China, only saying that the items for aid to China would be designated at any time. After the press conference, reporters interviewed Currie, President Roosevelt's representative who recently visited China. According to Currie, mechanical supplies for aid to China under the Lend-Lease Act are being allocated smoothly, and active efforts are being made to quickly transport them to China. President Roosevelt mentioned the list of goods China needs at Tuesday's press conference. This list, along with the list submitted by the United Kingdom, is being analyzed and allocated through legal procedures. Reporters learned that, so far, only China and the UK have received assistance under the Lend-Lease Act. Currently, the U.S. authorities are closely monitoring the development of the situation in the Far East. When the news of the Soviet-Japanese treaty first came, U.S. political circles were slightly shocked, but now they no longer pay much attention to it. The issue was not mentioned at all at yesterday's press conference. Newspapers here speculate a lot about whether Japan will advance southward after the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese treaty, but they say that Japan is still uneasy about the Soviet Union, so Japan's gains will not be as great as initially expected.

Washington - Regarding the issue of the U.S. providing military aid to China, President Roosevelt declared yesterday at a briefing at the White House that he would expand the military aid program within the scope of the Lend-Lease Act, and would also ship military supplies to China.

Washington - Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, said yesterday that any Soviet attempt to negotiate peace between China and Japan will fail. Therefore, a dictatorial peace that China cannot accept is inevitable. Hu said that both Italy and Germany had tried to induce China to accept negotiated peace, but failed. After Japan and the Soviet Union signed a new treaty, Japan feels more secure. The current peace will further allow Japan to advance southward. (19th United Press)

Washington - Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, discussed the new situation after the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact with officials from the U.S. State Department yesterday afternoon. After leaving the State Department, Hu Shih made a statement to reporters, stating that he firmly believed that the Soviet Union would hardly succeed if it mediated the Sino-Japanese war. Currently, the Chinese government is inquiring with the Soviet Union about ways to continue aid to China. Hu Shih reiterated that the Chinese government will continue to fight against Japan and will never put democratic countries in a difficult situation under any circumstances. A peace dictated by Japan will inevitably harm democratic countries, as the end of the Sino-Japanese war will allow Japan to transfer troops elsewhere to fight. Hu Shih added that his visit to the State Department was a courtesy call. (19th Huitong News Agency)

### Famous American Writer to Visit China Regularly

When asked whether the Dutch East Indies would resist aggression, Kleffens replied, "The Dutch will rise up and fight when attacked." When asked about the joint defense of the Dutch East Indies, Malaysia, and Australia, Kleffens said, "They are already united." He said that the interests of the Dutch East Indies, Malaysia, Australia, and the United States in the Pacific should naturally be united, but it is not convenient to make a statement at this time. "I believe that the United States and the Dutch East Indies have parallel rights in the South Pacific." Regarding his visit to Manila, Kleffens said that the issues discussed with the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies were that the Dutch East Indies' telegraphic communication with London was blocked. The two met with naval and army officers and may travel to Australia before returning to London. (19th United Press)

Tokyo - Japanese envoy Yoshizawa and Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens held another long talk in Batavia yesterday.

Singapore - According to official disclosure, a large number of the latest American-made fighter planes have arrived here. Yesterday, reporters saw dozens of American-made Buffalo fighter planes at an airport being assembled. Once completed and tested, they will be assigned to the Malayan Air Force. Malaysia already has many other types of American and British aircraft, so its air defense capabilities are indeed stronger than before. Reporters also saw several squadrons of Buffalo and Blenheim fighter-bombers at another airport, parked on the field. Soon after, they took off, soaring into the sky to show their readiness to fight the enemy. The reporters later visited an Australian Air Force airfield and witnessed several squadrons of American-made Hudson fighter-bombers and Australian-made Wirraway dive bombers. (19th Reuters)

### U.S. Continues to Supply the Soviet Union with Kerosene; No Change in Business Relations; Vichy Believes That After the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty, Soviet Attention Will Shift to the Near East

Washington - The U.S. Maritime Commission recently announced that it is continuing to supply the Soviet Union with kerosene. The oil tanker "Doughty" has obtained an export permit to load kerosene from a port in California and transport it to Vladivostok, Soviet Union. Soviet Ambassador to the United States Maisky previously held talks with State Department officials to determine bilateral trade policies. In recent months, the U.S. government has repeatedly issued such kerosene export permits. Although the Soviet Union and Japan have now signed a neutrality treaty, the United States is still issuing permits as usual. It can be seen that there have been no changes in U.S.-Soviet relations. (18th Havas)

Vichy - Observers here believe that after the Soviet Union and Japan signed a neutrality treaty, the Soviet Union can rest easy in the Far East. The Soviet Union will shift its attention to the Middle East and include Iran, Afghanistan, and even India in its "sphere of existence." Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov publicly denounced two Iranian planes for flying over the Baku oil fields on August 1 last year, and relations between the two sides have not improved since. Subsequently, the Soviet Red Army conducted exercises near the Iranian border, and the airline between Baku and Tehran, Iran, was also suspended, which is noteworthy. (19th Havas)

Editorial

### The European War and the United States and the Soviet Union

Since the outbreak of the Balkan War on the 6th of this month, the German army has gained a strategic advantage by preempting the initiative, and has been able to launch blitzkrieg tactics. Without waiting for the Allied forces to be fully prepared, it first broke the resistance of Yugoslavia with heavy troops, and then concentrated its forces to approach Greece. According to yesterday's reports, the Nazi troops are said to have broken through the Saranda-Baulon mountain pass and are eyeing the Larissa Plain. If so, although the Greek war situation may not have reached the final defeat stage, the Allied forces' extremely tight situation is undeniable.

We have said long ago that the gains and losses in the Balkans are only a fragment of victory or defeat in the entire European war. Although it has a considerable impact on the final outcome, it is by no means a decisive factor. In other words, even if Hitler controls the entire Balkans, whether he can defeat Britain depends on his subsequent actions. The current European war cannot be concluded that Britain will be defeated simply because the German army is gaining momentum in the Balkans. This situation is no different from when Hitler was unable to gain a firm advantage after the German army defeated France last summer. Therefore, while acknowledging the increasing seriousness of the Balkan situation, we should still calmly examine the possible actions of Germany in the future and the possible development of other factors outside the belligerent countries—especially the future trends of the United States and the Soviet Union, the two major neutral countries.

First, judging from the German army's performance in attacking Greece in the past two weeks, its progress cannot be considered very rapid, and it is even less smooth than when it invaded France last summer. Let's take a step back and assume that Hitler can completely occupy Greece in a short period of time. It is estimated that after the victory, he will take two paths forward. One is to continue eastward, plunder the Near East, and adopt a so-called pincer offensive to sandwich the British forces in the Nile River Basin, thereby encompassing Suez, Palestine, and the Iraqi oil fields. The second is to manage Western Europe and directly attack the British Isles. This requires first forcing France to hand over its fleet and inducing Spain to join the Axis powers to threaten Gibraltar, and then launching large-scale military operations to attack the British nerve center. It is impossible to predict at this time whether Hitler is preparing to continue eastward, change to advancing westward, or advance east and west simultaneously. However, one thing can be asserted, that is, whether advancing east or west, the one directly threatened is Britain, and the one indirectly affected is the United States and the Soviet Union.

Second, assuming that Hitler is determined to advance into the Near East, the Soviet Union will not only be in greater danger of being implicated, but the excessive expansion of Nazi forces will increasingly threaten the Soviet Union's own security. Moreover, the Soviet Union has repeatedly expressed its dissatisfaction with Germany's recent expansion of its influence into Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. Although Bulgaria has become an Axis vassal, it is still nominally an independent country. Leaving that aside, if Yugoslavia, as reported by foreign news, becomes an object freely divided by the Axis powers, disregarding the Soviet Union, which has just signed a non-aggression pact with Yugoslavia and belongs to the same Slavic race, it will inevitably make the Moscow authorities very embarrassed. Although Hitler may not have the intention of breaking up with the Soviet Union at this time, he at least does not value this friend, whom he once considered a confidant last summer, as much as before. After this, if he decides to advance eastward, he will at most not directly infringe on it, and may not be willing to pretend to be polite anymore. Under such circumstances, it is unknown how the Soviet Union will deal with itself, continuing to feign friendship with Germany, or taking the initiative to expand its influence in the Near East and Middle East. This is a very important issue at present.

Third, assuming that after controlling the Balkans, Hitler temporarily stops advancing eastward, or while advancing eastward, simultaneously manages Western Europe, then the war in the Atlantic will inevitably expand further. The impact will be such that the safety of the United States and even the entire Western Hemisphere will be in imminent danger. At the very least, the United States will feel more intense obstruction and destruction of its supply of war materials to Britain. Observing the dynamics of the Washington authorities, although the military escort is temporarily unable to be implemented due to the meddling of isolationists, if Germany implements a westward advance and makes the situation in the British Isles tense and precarious, it is believed that President Roosevelt will not sit idly by. In this way, whether the United States disregards everything and implements armed escorts, or directly participates in the war, will become an urgent issue that the master of the White House must decide decisively. If the United States participates in the war, not only will the European war situation undergo a dramatic change, but the entire world situation will also stir up enormous waves. What's more, the Japanese southward advance faction, which is waiting for an opportunity, is waiting for the Axis powers to gain fragmentary victories, hoping to take advantage of the situation in Nanyang!

Looking at the European war situation today, not only have the belligerent parties of Britain and Germany reached the stage of hand-to-hand combat, but the two major neutral countries of the United States and the Soviet Union, which have so far stayed out of the matter, have actually approached the edge of war. What to do in the future will undoubtedly be a major key that the world will focus on.

### A Military Expert Discusses the Battle Situation at the Foothills of Dahong Mountain

Chongqing - In recent days, the battle for the outer strongholds on the southern foothills of Dahong Mountain has become increasingly fierce. As of the 18th night, the entire Japanese line has gradually begun to waver. It is expected that the Chinese army will gain considerable results in the future. A Central News Agency reporter visited a military expert on the morning of the 17th to inquire about the battle situation. The expert said, "The Japanese are determined to launch a so-called Dahong Mountain mopping-up campaign. Their deployment is to use a north-south pincer attack method. In the southern part of Dahong Mountain, using Zhongxiang as a base, they began to stir on the morning of the 10th, dividing into three groups and advancing northeast. One group moved north to Changshoudian via Yangzi, one group moved north to Xujiadian via Guniuling South, and one group attacked near Xiangjialing and Shaojiatai. The Japanese army north of Dahong Mountain, using places such as Suixian as a base, also divided into three groups and invaded west on the morning of the 12th. One group moved from Maping to Huangjiapeng Yu, one group moved from Xihe to Sanwen Lake via Hejiadian and other places, and another group directly attacked Junchuan from Suixian. The Chinese army had already made meticulous deployments, launching a fierce counter-attack against the Japanese coming from the south of the mountain, pressing the Japanese army so that they could not move. Later, the Japanese repeatedly reinforced, leading to a fierce battle for Gaofeng Mountain. As of the morning of the 18th, the two sides were still facing each other near the watershed. The Japanese army coming from the northern part of Dahong Mountain has been held back by the Chinese army with clever tactics in the Hejiadian area. Although the Japanese repeatedly tried to attack, they had to retreat south to the Liujiadian area due to the strong Chinese forces. The Chinese are currently tracking and pursuing, expecting to win a great victory." The military expert added that "Dahong Mountain has always been occupied by the Chinese army in the battles of the past few years. The Japanese have never been able to force the Chinese to leave the mountain. The Chinese army occupies this ridge, and can threaten Jingzhong in the south and attack Suilu on the east, so the Japanese have never been able to rest easy. This decision to stir is their highest attempt to avenge the disastrous defeat in northern Jiangxi." (19th Dispatch)

### Wang Chonghui Discusses International Situation: Significant Changes Imminent; Soviet-Japanese Agreement Does Not Affect Soviet Policy Towards China; No Change in Bilateral Relations, Northwest Transportation Continues as Usual

Chongqing – Foreign Minister Wang, after reporting on China's diplomacy at a meeting of the Chongqing-based committee of the National Political Council yesterday, also discussed the overall international situation, predicting that significant changes would occur in the coming months. Foreign Minister Wang emphasized that the Soviet Union guarantees that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact will not affect its policy towards China. However, because the government mentioned "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia in the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration, it is taking a reserved attitude toward the Soviet guarantee. The government maintains friendly relations with the Soviet Union and is paying attention to continued development. In short, there has been no change in Sino-Soviet relations, and Northwest transportation is currently maintained as usual. People here are speculating about how long the Soviet Union can remain outside the European war, and if the Soviet Union joins the war, whether Japan's attitude towards the Soviet Union will change. This is because the Neutrality Pact only concerns third parties, and is not directly related to the Soviet Union and Japan like a non-aggression pact would be. Foreign Minister Wang urged the nation to prepare for a long and arduous struggle, which would not end until the goals of resistance and reconstruction are fully achieved. (19th Reuters Dispatch)

### German Troops Occupy Larissa, Reach Thessaly Plain; German Flag Planted Atop Mount Olympus; British-Greek Allied Forces Retreat to Third Line of Defense

Berlin – This afternoon's German war report stated that there was a complete ceasefire in the Serbian theater of war yesterday afternoon. In Greece, German troops fighting pushed through the mountains northeast of the Pindus Mountains. When German troops attacked Mount Olympus, the British rearguard was repulsed. The city of Larissa has been occupied by German troops, and German mountaineering teams have climbed to the summit of Mount Olympus, planting the German flag. Five aircraft at the Greek airfield were hit and burned. Several military transport ships (29,000 tons) were destroyed by German aircraft in the port of Chalcis, and several other merchant ships were hit. (19th Haitong Dispatch)

Berlin – The German High Command recently stated that German troops, led by mechanized divisions and fierce Alpine troops, had, after fierce fighting, repulsed the British-Greek rear guard, occupied the entire British-Greek second main line of defense in Mount Olympus, and entered the Thessaly Plain, occupying Larissa, an important highway junction in the plain. The British-Greek forces are retreating in panic further south to the third line of defense between the Pindus Mountains and the Ionian Sea. The communique also stated that despite the adverse weather, German aircraft continued to cooperate with the army, attacking British-Greek troops near Larissa and on the highway from Ioannina to Avdella. (19th United Press Dispatch)

Vichy – Last night at 7 PM, news from the Greek front was received here on the Axis side that the German "Panzer divisions" attacking from Souvala had broken through the British-Greek defense lines and passed through the Salda Pass. The breakthrough of this line is considered extremely important, as the mountain pass is one of the last defenses on the Thessaly Plain. Sources there stated that the Greek left and right wings were putting up resistance, but the central Salanda Pass had been breached. (19th United Press)

London – After British and Greek forces in northern Greece withdrew to a shorter defensive line, German forces attempted to break through and enter the Thessaly Plain, but were stopped. A British General Headquarters communique stated that British and Greek forces withdrew due to "increased German pressure." The German commander is now transferring troops from the southern border into Greece as reinforcements, attacking three crucial mountain passes, two of which are held by British forces. The latest communiques from Greek intelligence all state that fierce fighting is continuing along the 150-mile front line. In one particularly fierce battle, British forces guarding the Salanda Pass repulsed a fierce attack by German tanks and infantry. German forces also launched a fierce but unsuccessful attack on the mountain pass south of Mount Olympus, which is defended by Australian troops. It is reported that there are as many as ten German divisions, totaling 120,000 men, in that area. Greek forces on the left flank of the British forces north of Kalabaka (the center of the Allied line) are now under heavy pressure. Although German forces have not broken through this line, Athens admits that the German advance is relentless despite casualties, so the situation is serious. A communique from the British military headquarters in Greece stated that British fighters and bombers were quite active yesterday, supporting land forces, constantly bombing enemy traffic. British fighters also repeatedly flew out for reconnaissance, and all planes returned safely. (19th Reuters Dispatch)

### German Blitz Units Advance Bravely Despite Heavy Casualties; Elite British Troops Respond Fiercely

Greek Front – Yesterday's major battles in the mountain passes were extremely fierce and terrifying. German land and air forces have a great numerical advantage. British, Australian, and New Zealand troops are fighting hard in the mountains. Although the situation is extremely difficult, they are responding bravely and their positions have not wavered. The British army has a firm determination that the German army must pay a very high price for every foot of land they gain. Hitler has never been so willing to waste lives on various battlefields. German youths rush forward in batches, one falling after another in an endless stream. The Balkan mountain paths are covered with German soldiers' corpses. The ferocity of the German infantry is being met by the Australian army. Newly organized "German Lightning Units" (selected from the Hitler Youth) risk traversing cliffs and narrow paths. Those who died in front of machine guns were like cattle and horses. This kind of suicide squad continued non-stop every hour, until the defending forces were exhausted. At the same time, tanks rumbled in, encountering British artillery fire in the mountains. The artillery fire was like a wall, preventing them from advancing. They then changed their approach and advanced towards flatter areas. (19th United Press Dispatch)

### Allied Forces in Macedonia Sacrificing Valiantly, Worthy of Song and Tears

Athens – Local newspapers have recently reported that when German forces were in the Macedonia area, they used 30-ton giant tanks, under the cover of more than a thousand bombers, to launch a fierce attack on Greek positions. British and Greek allied forces resisted to the death, making heroic sacrifices, worthy of song and tears, and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. (18th Havas Dispatch)

Berlin – An official from the German High Command stated that yesterday five divisions of Greek troops in western Macedonia were "annihilated." German forces captured 7,000 Greek soldiers and seized a large amount of war materiel. Between Mount Olympus and the Pindus Mountains, the fighting is intensifying. German mechanized divisions are now advancing in a new pincer formation. Although the terrain is treacherous and the road difficult, German forces have still entered the Thessaly region, fighting against elite Australian troops, and capturing many prisoners. It is claimed that because the defense line in western Macedonia has been broken, British and Greek forces are greatly threatened. It is rumored that after the German mechanized divisions entered Thessaly, they cut off the British and Greek lines in two major locations. It is claimed that the strategically important location of Kalabaka will soon be occupied by German forces. This location, in central Greece, is the gateway to Trikala.

The Greek defense line near the city of Argyrokastron was also breached, and Italian forces have entered the city. (18th Havas Dispatch)

London – Today a Greek military spokesman in Athens stated that Greek forces in Albania have withdrawn to new positions, because Germany has invaded western Macedonia from Yugoslavia, thus necessitating this strategic shift. The Greek retreat was orderly and Italian forces were unable to stop it.

Yugoslavia is now helping its allies on the sea. The Yugoslav ambassador to the United States stated last night that the collapse of organized resistance in Yugoslavia does not mean that the Yugoslav people have abandoned their struggle against the Axis aggressors. King Peter and his government and people will continue to fight. (19th Reuters Dispatch)

### Greek War Situation Takes a Sudden Turn; Near East Crisis Imminent; Soviet Union Actively Engaged in Military and Diplomatic Activities; British Troops Deploy in Southern Iraq

London – Foreign diplomatic officials here believe that Greek resistance will last no more than a few weeks, and that a terrifying war of great historical importance will occur in Egypt and the Suez Canal after Greek resistance ends. It is believed here that if Hitler defeats Greece, he will transport a large number of mechanized troops to Tripoli in Libya via Turkey to engage in a major battle in Egypt. Most foreign ambassadors here share this view, believing that the Axis powers have a better chance of completing their victory in the Mediterranean through Egypt than by challenging Turkey in the Anatolian region. Although diplomatic officials believe that the Soviet Union will not take military action even if German troops cross the Dardanelles and enter Turkey, they believe that the German leader will avoid the danger of fighting the Soviet Red Army and Air Force and will not act rashly until the best opportunity arises. Responsible foreign diplomats believe that if Britain does not immediately withdraw its troops from Greece and transfer them to Alexandria, it will only be concerned with honor, which actually conflicts with its war results and interests. It is expected that Turkey will revise its pro-British policy and tend towards strict neutrality. Foreign ambassadors also strongly emphasized that Egypt and Anatolia are very important, because if the United States sends an expeditionary force to participate in the war in the future, they can be used as a base. According to unconfirmed rumors, Japan has decided that the Axis powers occupying the Suez Canal is a condition for Japan's participation in the war, but this rumor is generally doubted. (19th United Press Dispatch)

Vichy – Diplomatic officials recently stated that as a result of the German attack on the Aegean Sea, the Soviet Union has taken various plans regarding the Near East and Asia. They also stated that there is a secret clause in the Soviet-Turkish agreement, stipulating that Turkey can, according to the 1934 agreement, cooperate politically with Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan. However, it is not yet confirmed whether this clause exists, and there has been no mention of military clauses in the agreement. Iraq severed relations with Germany on September 6, 1939, but it is reported that the new Iraqi government is supported by army leaders who are determined to fight alongside Germany and Turkey in the European war. These leaders demand complete independence and complete freedom from British constraints. Also, the "Daily News" stated that after the Soviet-Japanese pact, important secret negotiations between Ankara and Moscow have been conducted. The newspaper stated that the public believes that Iran's resistance is very important for the Soviet Union's Near East defense plan, because the Soviet Union may occupy Iran by force. The newspaper also stated that Iran lacks modern weapons. (19th United Press Dispatch) London, according to official announcements, powerful British Empire troops have arrived in Basra (an important town in southern Iraq) to protect important transportation routes through Iraq. The new Iraqi government is now providing full convenience. According to official announcements, the British Empire troops' arrival in Basra is based on the provisions of the British-Iraqi alliance. The new Iraqi government is fulfilling the promise made by Al-Gailani and is now providing full convenience to the British army and has sent a senior military officer to Basra to welcome the British army commander and assist in making various arrangements. Local residents have also expressed a warm welcome to the British army. People here have a good impression of the cooperation of the Iraqi authorities and hope that a more solid relationship will be established between the two countries soon. (19th Reuters Dispatch)

### Turkey Expresses Determination to Defend Against Aggression; Istanbul Evacuates Residents; British Citizens Evacuate from Turkey

Istanbul – Local newspapers commented this morning on the Greek war, saying that German troops and the British-Greek Allied forces are about to engage in a major battle at Mersa Matruh, and that the fate of the Mediterranean will depend on this battle. As for Turkey, it will defend its national territory and sovereignty with all its strength. Anatolia and Istanbul are natural barriers, enough to prevent any strong enemy. (19th Havas Agency Dispatch)

Ankara – Istanbul began an organized evacuation of residents today. Those who voluntarily evacuate are issued numbered tickets, and these numbers are announced in the newspapers two days before the train departs. (19th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

Ankara – The British citizens who have left Turkey are only British refugees from the Balkan countries. They mostly left voluntarily, because the British Embassy in Turkey has not issued any advice or orders for British citizens to evacuate. Some Turks in Istanbul have been ordered to evacuate, but none have been subsidized by the government. (19th Reuters Dispatch)

### Delicate Turkish-German Relations

Istanbul – Today's "Dan News" warned readers not to lightly believe the rumors spread by the German side after the German ambassador to Turkey returned home that Germany is now proposing to sign a non-aggression pact with Turkey. (19th Reuters Dispatch)

Istanbul – Political figures recently stated that German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen may report to Hitler that Germany's attempt to cooperate with Turkey in the Eastward advance or attack on the Soviet Union has failed. The German ambassador's departure to Berlin will be to meet with the German leader, and may also report that Soviet-Turkish relations have improved due to the Soviet-Japanese treaty, allowing the Soviet Union to adopt a stronger stance in the West. According to political figures, Turkey will not sign a non-aggression pact with Germany at this time, and may be unwilling to block the Dardanelles to prevent British ships from entering the Black Sea if Germany attacks the Soviet Union. These figures also stated that the German army wants to peacefully pass through Turkey to the Near East, fearing there would be no such opportunity, and that Turks do not care about the withdrawal of German and Bulgarian troops from the Turkish border, nor do they recognize this move by the German side as a friendly gesture. As a result, Papen may report that flattery and guarantees have not been able to pull Turkey into the Axis, and that military force may be necessary. (19th United Press Dispatch)

### Soviet Ambassador to Britain Visits Eden

London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky recently visited British Foreign Secretary Eden at the Foreign Office.

### Turkey and Iraq to Negotiate Military Alliance; Former Iraqi Regent Reported to Have Fled to Transjordan

Beirut – According to semi-official sources in the Iraqi capital, negotiations between Turkey and Iraq on the conclusion of a political and military alliance will begin soon. (19th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

It is also reported that former Foreign Minister Sait and former Prime Minister Matset also went with him. (18th Havas Agency Dispatch)

### British Government Issues Warning; If Athens or Cairo are Bombed, a Decision Will be Made to Bomb Rome in Retaliation

London – A statement issued by the residence at 10 Downing Street stated that in view of the German threats to bomb Athens and Cairo, the British government hereby declares that if one of these two cities is disturbed, the British will systematically bomb Rome. Once this action begins, it will continue until the bombing ends. British pilots have been given very strict orders to avoid bombing the Vatican City. However, the British government is aware that a team of Italian aircraft is stationed in Rome, preparing to use captured British bombs to throw on the Vatican City when British aircraft attack. It is necessary to expose this kind of trick that can expose the nature of the Italians. Regarding the British aircraft bombing Berlin on Thursday night, it is a fallacy to say that it was a retaliation for the German aircraft bombing London on Wednesday night, as the central aircraft's attack on Berlin was not retaliation, but a part of the normal policy adopted by the British Air Force following instructions from the British government, to bomb targets within the borders of the two guilty countries, Germany and Italy, in order to weaken their military and industrial strength. This policy will continue until the end of the war, and the scope of bombing is expected to increase and never end, regardless of whether the British Isles continue to be attacked. (19th Reuters Dispatch)

### German Troops in Libya Show No Sign of Advancing Eastward for the Time Being; Aircraft and Artillery Heavily Bomb Tobruk; Besieged British and Australian Troops Continue to Hold Their Ground

Cairo – Informed sources say that the German troops in Libya have no signs of advancing eastward again. Reports from all parties indicate that the German front line is in a state of extreme exhaustion, so the British troops in Tobruk and Solun are in an active position. (19th United Press Dispatch)

Tobruk – Yesterday, as Italian artillery shelled, covering the sky with smoke, Australian troops still held their ground, not retreating in the slightest. The fighting occurred at 3 PM on Sunday, when the Italian artillery fiercely shelled the outer defense line of Bardia, which had previously been occupied by the Italian army and whose defenses had only been determined by. The smoke of artillery fire mixed with dust, erupted violently from El Adem, where a large number of Italian bombs were stored, which had been captured when British armored vehicles and Australian infantry pierced the Italian defenses and crushed Italian resistance in January. Now all have been destroyed. Prior to the artillery bombardment of the nearly ten-mile radius semi-circular defense line, the port had been bombed by German giant black aircraft since 10 AM on Wednesday. Although these aircraft flew only a few hundred feet, they failed to hit the ships in the port. At 6 PM on Wednesday, ten German aircraft attacked Tobruk. The reporter saw three low-flying aircraft taking turns bombing the port, but they soon flew away, apparently repelled by anti-aircraft fire. At 10 PM on Wednesday, a single aircraft, seemingly an Italian aircraft, took advantage of the full moon as bright as a mirror to bomb the port at a very high altitude. The aircraft flew beyond the range of anti-aircraft fire, circling over the port for forty minutes, dropping bombs that made the sky glow yellow. (19th United Press Dispatch)

### English Newspaper Commentary: The Japan-Soviet Pact

London - The Times recently published an article commenting on the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact signed by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka on the eve of his departure from Moscow. It stated that from Japan's perspective, the agreement signed in Moscow seems to have drawn the same criticism as when Japan signed the Tripartite Pact. That is, Japan's diplomacy has once again been lured, resulting in a loss greater than the gain. The main clause of the agreement is that if one party becomes the target of military action, the other party will remain neutral. This seems to benefit Moscow primarily, as the world believes that Japan, unless deliberately provoked by any other strong nation, has no reason to become the target of another's military actions. The Soviet Union, however, is different and must constantly guard against attacks on its territory. Now that Soviet leaders seem to have acknowledged that a purely passive foreign policy contains certain risks and are expressing concern about the gradual development of Hitler's eastward policy, the formal promise of neutrality from Japan is timely. One reason for the Soviet Union's anxiety will be alleviated by obtaining Japan's clearly defined obligations to the Axis powers, which do not include guarantees of taking any action against the Soviet Union. However, this agreement will not provide equal consolation for what remains a major concern for Japanese politicians, namely the inability of the Japanese army to end the four-year-long China Incident. The newspaper also stated that, regardless of the implications of this new agreement, it is quite clear that it has failed to promote closer sympathy between the Soviet Union and the Axis policy. In fact, Berlin is quite indifferent to this agreement. The Soviet Union is not interested in any adventures by Japan in the South Pacific and does not need to sign diplomatic documents to guarantee it. For Japan to create new enemies and divide its forces in distant oceans is something that Soviet policy has sought but failed to achieve. Hitler's continued efforts to involve Japan in conflicts with Britain and the United States are for very obvious reasons. However, in reality, Germany cannot do much in the Far East. Regardless of what policy Japan adopts in that area, Germany seems unable to provide any substantial assistance beyond empty talk. Even if Hitler were to have actual power in the Pacific, he would certainly not use it for Japan's benefit. Japan may later discover that Germany's victory offers little benefit or glory to its allies, a situation that Italy is already experiencing. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Random Notes on the European War (46)

### A Spectacle of the American Navy

Transport Flying Boats - Specifically used for loading personnel and materials. These flying boats are modeled after the Pan American Airways Sikorsky amphibious flying boats. They have a speed of 125 miles per hour and a range of up to 2,000 miles.

Reconnaissance Aircraft - These are aircraft equipped on cruisers or battleships. They take off from the ship using catapults and land alongside the ship, then are hoisted aboard by cranes. The Curtiss SOC is commonly used, with a speed of 160 miles per hour and a range of 1,000 miles. Each cruiser can carry four of these aircraft, used for scouting enemy positions or dropping light bombs. In addition to their primary mission of searching for enemy蹤跡, they are also used to scout whether砲彈 hit enemy ships. Then, using wireless電報, they inform their own warships of the fall of the砲彈 to facilitate aimed轰击.

Fighter Aircraft - These are the fastest aircraft possessed by the Navy. The Grumman F4F is the latest type of fighter, with a speed of up to 250 miles per hour. Its purpose is to repel enemy bombers and prevent their reconnaissance aircraft from carrying out their missions. This aircraft is a single-seat model, equipped with multiple machine guns.

Reconnaissance Bombers - Their mission is reconnaissance and bombing. In addition to the main fuel tank, they also have reserve fuel tanks for long-distance flights. As a bomber, this aircraft can carry a 1,000-pound bomb and, like other bombers in the Navy, can perform dive bombing. The speed is 250 miles per hour, and the range is 1,000 miles.

The aircraft used by the U.S. Navy have different colors on their fuselages. Team colors and emblems are specified, and the color of the tail also has different meanings. For example, the aircraft on the aircraft carrier "Enterprise" have blue tails. There are also two thin red lines on top to allow personnel on the deck to observe clearly during landing. All aircraft翼面 are painted bridge yellow to make them easily distinguishable from the color of the sea.

(4) Naval War College

The U.S. Naval War College was founded by Rear Admiral Luce on October 6, 1884, just twenty years after the Civil War. Luce and his cohort, Mahan, knew well the importance of naval warfare in any campaign during that war. The purpose of the Naval War College is to train naval officers to acquire practical knowledge of naval warfare. Initially, the school was located in Newport, in a rather simple building. It has now moved to a small island in Newport Harbor, with brown buildings and perfect equipment.

The U.S. Navy will eventually fight with foreign countries in the near future. How to fight that war is what is studied at the Naval War College. Experts at the school hold a "on the floor" simulation warfare exercise every week. Therefore, the Naval War College is truly considered the brain of the U.S. Navy. Many graduates of the Annapolis Naval Academy, after practicing at sea for a period of time, come to the Naval War College to further their knowledge of warfare.

When it comes to warfare, it is not emotional impulses and passionate people who can win victories. Only those with calm minds, who have conducted considerable research on past major naval battles and various complex factors of the future, can be confident of victory. Currently, there are thirty-two students engaged in this research work at the university. The school plans to enroll 250 students each year, with the recent annual enrollment reaching one hundred. The school is divided into three levels, each lasting eleven months. The initial level is for naval majors and outstanding naval lieutenants to study. They are taught solutions to small situations encountered in naval battles. At the same time, they learn various basic knowledge, such as U.S. foreign policy, international law, wartime economics and finance, and the modern politics of the world's major powers. They are currently studying how Germany invaded the Netherlands and France, how the British army withdrew from Narvik and Dunkirk, and how the British navy defeated the French navy in the Oran battle. Finally, the instructors present some "quick decision problems" for the students to solve. The method is to lay out a combat map on a painted cloth floor in the "competition room" and instruct the students to solve the difficult problems within five minutes. After graduating from the initial level, they can re-enter the intermediate level after a few years, and finally the advanced level. The research focuses on macro-oriented tactics and the naval power of certain designated countries. In the "competition room" where actual combat tactics are studied, the floor is covered with black and white checkered painted cloth, each square being six inches wide, representing 6,000 square yards. Aircraft models are suspended from poles, weather conditions are written on the blackboard, and black cloth nets are used to represent smoke screens.

The best way to learn warfare is to actually fight. Because the United States cannot use real combat to teach officers the art of warfare, the students at the Naval War College can only "fight on paper." Rear Admiral Kalbfus, the president of the Naval War College, once said: "We are the objects of detectives. After he gets a murder case, he tries to figure out who the murderer is. We want to assassinate people and plan how to execute it." So the first lesson is to teach students that war is not just about fighting to the point of defeat, but about accomplishing a specific mission. The final and most valuable mission is to put the enemy to death in a war and completely destroy his force. Generally speaking, the strength at sea is to make the enemy's merchant ships disappear on the sea, blockade his base, and cut off his supply. (To be continued)

### Foreign Minister Wang Issues Statement on the Provisional Board of Directors of the Shanghai Concession; Concerned Countries Do Not Accept Chinese Government's Proposal; China Does Not Agree to Any Changes

Chongqing - Foreign Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement today regarding the establishment of a provisional board of directors for the Shanghai International Settlement: The Foreign Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement held a meeting on April 17 and passed a resolution to replace the existing board of directors with a so-called "Provisional Board of Directors," composed of sixteen directors, namely four Chinese, three each from Britain, the United States, and Japan, and one each from Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Prior to the passage of the above resolution, the British and American governments contacted the Chinese government and sought the Chinese government's consent to the proposed plan. During the course of negotiations, the Chinese government, recognizing the difficulties encountered by the authorities of the countries concerned in Shanghai, expressed its willingness to do its best to provide additional assistance to overcome the current situation. In this spirit of cooperation, the Chinese government proposed that the Chinese directors of the "Provisional Board of Directors" should be selected from the Chinese directors who have been legally elected by the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and that the implementation of the above proposed measures should be limited to a defined short period. The above proposal was both reasonable and as accommodating as possible, but the governments of the countries concerned sought to accept it. Therefore, the Chinese government has decided not to participate in the plan included in the above resolution, and hereby declares that the establishment of the "Provisional Board of Directors" and any changes to the Land Regulations have not been agreed to by the Chinese government.

### Germany Intensifies Naval Offensive; British Naval Power Will Surely Be Able to Cope

London - A Reuters correspondent with the British Home Fleet telegraphed from a naval base that as spring deepens, the Battle of the Atlantic is accelerating. Germany has shown greater use of its navy in the past few weeks than at any time since the beginning of the war. Germany is now deploying large numbers of submarines and using merchant raiders and surface vessels. There is no doubt that Germany will make great efforts to stop the war materials flowing from the United States to Britain under the Lend-Lease Act. However, in addition to escorting convoys, the British Navy can also inflict heavy blows on enemy raiders. The improving weather will certainly cause Germany to intensify its air raids on British ships, but the shorter nights will force Germany to rely less on submarines and more on surface raiders, which is beneficial to the Allies because detecting and sinking submarines is obviously more difficult than searching for surface vessels. Regardless of what action Germany takes, the British Navy is well-prepared and powerful enough to counter the German naval offensive. The Nazis will obviously do everything possible to eliminate or at least reduce the value of American aid to Britain. Although the British Navy, due to its extensive responsibilities, cannot deploy more warships as desired in the intensified Battle of the Atlantic, its strength is sufficient to cope. The inadequacy of Mussolini's navy will certainly affect the balance of power in the Atlantic. The mission of the American fleet was originally to restrain some of the powerful warships of the British Navy from operating outside the Mediterranean. Now that the Italian fleet has been severely defeated, the British can deploy a number of British ships stationed in the Mediterranean to serve in the Atlantic and other areas. In addition to the newly built destroyers and cruisers, there are also the 35,000-ton battleships of the King George V class, whose strong armament and weekly protection exceed the standards of any previous warship. Two of the six new aircraft carriers have already entered service, with a length of 753 feet and a displacement of 23,000 tons, equipped with sixteen 4.5-inch guns. The victories won by the Naval Air Force in the Mediterranean and other places have shown how important these new aircraft carriers will be in the intensified naval warfare. All of the enemy's naval vessels, including several battleships and at least one heavy cruiser, and the battleships "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau," both of 26,000 tons, have been damaged by British aircraft in Brest. Germany's largest warships, the "Tirpitz" and "Bismarck," are expected to have entered service earlier this year. Both of these ships have a displacement of 35,000 tons each, equipped with eight 15-inch guns, twelve 5.9-inch guns, and sixteen 4.1-inch guns, with a speed of 30 knots. In addition, Germany also has the 10,000-ton pocket battleship "Admiral Scheer" and at least one Hipper-class heavy cruiser. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

### How to Study Chemistry (4)

(6) Thorough Understanding: Although memorization helps with the study of chemistry, it is ultimately not as important as understanding. Memorization is partial, while understanding is complete. Memorization is time-bound, while understanding is permanent. Now, I will describe several key points that help with understanding: (A) Think more, (B) Ask more, (C) Analyze and synthesize. We all know that zinc plus dilute hydrochloric acid produces hydrogen, while zinc plus dilute nitric acid produces ammonia instead of hydrogen. The equation is as follows:

Because the hydrogen produced in the first equation is a reducing agent that encounters the nitric acid in the second equation, it is reduced to ammonia. Ammonia combines with water to form ammonium hydroxide. Ammonium hydroxide then combines with nitric acid to form ammonium nitrate and water. Combining the above four equations, we can cross out the common substances on both sides of the arrow to obtain the fifth equation, which is exactly the same as the originally written equation. The reason why zinc plus dilute nitric acid does not produce hydrogen can be understood from this, and this equation is easy to remember and not easy to forget. Therefore, I believe that thorough understanding is much more important than rote memorization.

In short, if we want to study chemistry and achieve perfect results, it all depends on the student themselves. The chemical knowledge obtained from teachers or books cannot be satisfactory unless it has been carefully thought about by oneself. Just as eating nutritious food has no nutritional effect on the body unless it is chewed and digested carefully, studying chemistry can be successful if the above conditions are followed, and I dare to assert that it will not only be possible to succeed in studying chemistry, but also to become a top-notch chemist.

### Food, the Rice Market is Committing Many Evils, Simply Starving the Masses to Death, New Price Limit is High, Black Market Premium is High Every Day, What is the Use of Price Limits if the People's Food is Not Considered?

On the third day of the foreign rice price limit, the rampant black market premiums and the lively "scalpers" are still seen. At this point, there is no justice to speak of in the market, and no regular routines to follow. Confused, they compete for money to pocket, and in an uproar, only the strange phenomenon of mutual deception is seen. Twenty to thirty thousand bags of new foreign rice have arrived, and there are hundreds of thousands of bags in storage, but they have no impact on the market at all. The only things that can affect the market are rumors and price increases. Therefore, after the market opened, the "scalpers" were even more active, and those who held the goods were willing to raise the price. The small-sized rice premium was only 250 yuan the day before yesterday, but today's opening price was 300 yuan, and then it was raised by 50 yuan and 100 yuan, increasing again and again until each hundred was at a premium of 500 yuan. If there are no new transactions, it may be 600 or 700, or even 1,000 or 2,000, or even another top price of 4,400. At this rice price of 160 yuan per stone, the people's food has been thrown to the back of their minds. What is the use of price limits? Isn't it to make the general rice-storing monks become Buddhas on the spot (foreign Buddhas, too), casting golden figures to pass on for ten thousand generations? I'm afraid the calculations are not as desired, or suddenly there will be a reverse "accumulated generations, and even become a family and then return to square one"? Saigon fire grain also has premiums up to 200 or 300 yuan. Broken rice has a premium but has not been sold, because a new transaction has been agreed upon for 700 tons of Xin Chang Sheng mixed broken rice, priced at only 115 yuan, which is seven cents lower than the same goods the day before yesterday. Also, 550 tons of Saigon No. 1, priced at 146 yuan, and re-listing is No. 1 at 149 yuan. Broken rice is currently at 116 yuan, which is half a yuan lower than the day before yesterday, and white-bodied large grain is at 146 yuan, and small grain is currently at 146 yuan plus a premium. The total re-listing of the original package was more than a thousand tons. The Saigon new transactions and re-listing and broken rice are all in late April and early May. Currently, there are 30,000 bags of foreign rice inside and outside Shanghai, and foreign rice is arriving in Shanghai one after another. Jardine Matheson's Risheng wheel arrived at the port yesterday morning, carrying 2,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and stopped at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. It is heard that New Lun Yuen's Grant wheel is carrying a large amount of foreign rice from Saigon to Shanghai, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai next Tuesday. (Zu)

Thick and thin japonica and glutinous rice are not as widely sold as foreign rice on a normal day, so although the market goods are scarce, the owners cannot easily make a reckless move. The sales are still opened according to the limit. However, the middle decisions are mixed, and it is difficult to distinguish between good and bad.

### Flour Market Openly Fixed, Secretly Firm

Flour, yesterday's flour market trend, the Grain Trade Association market, in order to uphold the intentions of the authorities, has already met to stipulate detailed price limits for each good, and is not allowed to exceed them. And foreign flour is neither bought and sold in the Manufacturers' Association, nor is it restricted by the Miscellaneous Grains Association, so transactions have already stopped invisibly. However, the sales to the north and south gangs and the mainland are still very good these days, and sporadic additions are endless. Therefore, there are still many businesses who directly distribute to customers. It is heard that the price of flour is 30 yuan and 5 cents, and the price of Kan flour is 29 yuan and 89 cents. Because black market rice prices are rampant, the market is also quite secretly firm.

Wheat, yesterday's transaction was still sluggish, because Dumai stocks are lacking. This decision by the authorities to implement price limits, there is no goods and no market for wheat, only Japanese factory stores occasionally take in, the price is still 45 or 6 yuan.

### Oilcake and Miscellaneous Grains, Transactions Not Prosperous

Yesterday's miscellaneous grain and oilcake market conditions, after the industry association stipulated a part of the price limit, the situation was slightly clarified, but transactions have not been active, and the market has not exceeded the limit. However, the overall situation is still tense, and off-site black market premiums are inevitable. It is estimated that 600 bags of various soybeans, 4500 bags of raw peanuts, 600 bags of corn, red grain white spectrum bags, and 6,000 pieces of beancake were traded. Half of the purchases were made by local street wholesalers.

### Economic Jottings

— Feng Liutang

Business Strategies in the Pre-Qin Era (Continued from the 17th)

In ancient times, only Sima Qian possessed the unique vision to recognize the inevitable prominence of commerce and industry in later generations. Therefore, he uniquely dedicated a chapter in the Records of the Grand Historian to "The Biographies of Money-Makers." Although later dynastic histories also included a section on "Food and Goods," they rarely delved into the dynamics of commercial and industrial society. The methods of wealth accumulation described in "The Biographies of Money-Makers" are worthy of extensive study. I will now outline their key points.

As Ji Ran said:

"By observing surplus and deficiency, one can know what is expensive and what is cheap. When prices reach their highest point, they will revert to cheapness; when prices reach their lowest point, they will revert to expensiveness. Sell when things are expensive as if they were dung, buy when things are cheap as if they were jade. Money and goods should flow like water."

This is why Gou Jian achieved hegemony and Fan Li became wealthy, all thanks to Ji Ran's strategies. Suo Yin explains: "When things become extremely expensive, they must become cheap; when things become extremely cheap, they must become expensive. Selling when things are expensive as if they were dung means that after they have become extremely expensive, one fears they will become cheap, so one seizes the moment to sell them off as if they were dung. Buying when things are cheap as if they were jade means that after they have become extremely cheap, one fears they will become expensive, so one seizes the moment to buy them up as if they were jade. This is the way to accumulate wealth." Sima Qian also said:

"Therefore, when things are cheap, it is a sign that they will become expensive; when things are expensive, it is a sign that they will become cheap. Encourage everyone in their respective occupations, and make them enjoy their work, like water flowing downwards, ceaselessly day and night. Goods will come without being summoned, and people will produce them without being asked. Is this not in accordance with the Dao, and a natural verification of it!"

When things are cheap, it is a sign that they will become expensive; when things are expensive, it is a sign that they will become cheap; this means that one must sell cheap goods where they are expensive, and buy expensive goods where they are cheap; and then encourage everyone in their respective occupations, and make them enjoy their work, just as water flows downwards, which is in accordance with natural law.

Bai Gui's key to business was "Observe changes in the market, take what others discard, and give what others take." Therefore, those who discussed making a living at the time looked to Bai Gui as an example, and the merchants of today are no different. However, Bai Gui believed that it was difficult to master his techniques completely, so he said:

"My management of production is like Yi Yin and Lü Shang's strategies, Sun Wu's use of troops, and Shang Yang's fixing of laws. Therefore, if one's intelligence is insufficient for adapting to changes, one's courage is insufficient for making decisions, one's benevolence is insufficient for taking and giving, and one's strength is insufficient for holding onto what one has, even if one wants to learn my techniques, I will never tell them."

In recent times, there is a saying, "The lowest trades have the highest profits," meaning that even if a skill is considered inferior, its profits are greater. This is also mentioned in the Records of the Grand Historian, which says:

"To seek wealth from poverty, farming is inferior to crafts, and crafts are inferior to commerce. Embroidering patterns is inferior to standing at the market gate. This refers to low-end occupations, the resources of the poor."

"Buying goods, buy them when they are genuine; losing capital, lose it lightly." This is the language of commerce. In the Han Dynasty, the Qian family of Xuanqu became wealthy through farming and animal husbandry. When everyone else rushed to buy cheap goods, the Ren family alone bought expensive ones, and they remained wealthy for several generations.

Therefore, Sima Qian believed that

"If wealth has no regular occupation, then goods will have no wealthy owner. The capable will converge, and the incapable will collapse."

In a nutshell, as long as one has the skill to do business, it is not difficult to become wealthy and establish a family. This was true in the Pre-Qin era, and it is even more evident in the Post-Qin era.

However, how should one handle the wealth gained from business? The best example is the famous General Fubo, Ma Yuan.

"Ma Yuan traveled between Long and Han, and once said to his guests: 'A man should have ambition. When poor, he should become more steadfast; when old, he should become stronger.' So he engaged in farming and animal husbandry, eventually owning thousands of cattle, horses, and sheep, and tens of thousands of bushels of grain. Then he sighed and said: 'The value of accumulating wealth lies in being able to use it to help others. Otherwise, one is just a money-guarding slave!' So he gave it all to his younger brothers, relatives, and old friends, and wore only sheepskin coats and trousers." Conversely, a stingy example is Jin Yijie: "Wang Rong was fond of seeking profit, widely acquiring gardens and water mills in all directions, all over the land. He accumulated and hoarded money without end, constantly calculating day and night with his abacus (a piece of evidence of accounting in that era), always feeling that it was not enough. Yet he was also frugal and did not provide for himself. People ridiculed him as suffering from an incurable disease. His daughter borrowed tens of thousands of coins, which she did not return for a long time. After his daughter's mourning period ended, Wang Rong was displeased. His daughter quickly returned the money, and only then was he happy."

An extravagant example is Shi Chong of the Jin Dynasty. Shi Chong's extravagance is still talked about today.

"Shi Chong was arrested and taken to the Eastern Market in a cart. Shi Chong sighed and said, 'These slaves are after my family's wealth.' The arresting officer replied, 'Knowing that wealth brings harm, why didn't you distribute it earlier?' Shi Chong could not answer. More than thirty water mills, more than eight hundred household servants, and countless goods, treasures, fields, and residences were all confiscated by the government."

Therefore, it is written that "A family that accumulates good deeds will surely have blessings in abundance; a family that accumulates small evils will surely have disasters in abundance." Although it is not as if they follow each other like form and shadow, they are not far apart. (The End)

### It Is Reported That Japanese Troops Have Landed on the Coastal Areas of Zhejiang and Fujian, Turning the War Situation in Eastern Zhejiang Tense. Chinese Troops Are Resisting in Separate Routes, and Battles Are Fierce. There Have Been No Replies to Inquiries from All Sides. Shanghai's Telegraph and Postal Bureaus Are Accepting and Sending Telegrams as Usual.

The war situation in Eastern Zhejiang has become tense since Japanese troops moved from the Xiaoshan area and Japanese warships have been active along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian. Yesterday, it was widely rumored in Shanghai that Japanese naval landing forces had landed in Zhenhai, Kanmen (under Wenzhou jurisdiction), and Minhou in Fujian, and that the situation in Zhenhai and Ningbo was chaotic.

Telegraph Lines between Ningbo and Shaoxing Were Down Yesterday

According to inquiries made by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency to various parties, neither the Ningbo sojourners' association in Shanghai nor the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping companies received any telegrams from Ningbo yesterday. However, the various organizations sent telegrams to inquire, but there were no replies. It is suspected that the telegraph lines are down, and the true situation cannot be known. On the 18th, the Shaoxing sojourners' association in Shanghai sent telegrams to inquire about the situation in Shaoxing, but as of last night, there were no replies. However, according to the Wenzhou sojourners' association, merchant groups from Wenzhou in Shanghai received a telegram from Wenzhou yesterday afternoon (the 19th), stating that after the suburbs of Yongjia had been bombed by Japanese planes for several days, the residents of the city had completely moved to the countryside, and their belongings had been scattered. The Japanese troops who landed in Kanmen are engaged in fierce battles with Chinese troops in the Yuhuan area.

Fierce Battles in Keqiao and Qianqing

Recently, various places in eastern Zhejiang, such as Jinhua, Shipu, Haitou, and Xikou, have been bombed several times. Japanese planes are also scouting in batches, and air raid alarms are frequent. Japanese warships are patrolling back and forth along the coast. Currently, there are five Japanese warships off the coast of Shipu and one ship outside the Zhenhai harbor, but there has been no unusual activity. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices of materials and lives, the authorities have ordered evacuations, but the people are extremely calm. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the Datong News Agency to the Shaoxing sojourners' association in Shanghai, the association sent a telegram to County Magistrate Cai of Yuyao, who reported that on the 17th, Japanese troops from Xiaoshan suddenly advanced eastward in separate routes. After being met by the garrison, battles broke out in the Keqiao (30 li east of Shaoxing) and Qianqing areas, and were quite fierce. The telegraph and postal bureaus in Shanghai are accepting and sending telegrams and mail to and from Shanghai and Shaoxing as usual. However, the bureaus cannot guarantee that they will arrive safely, as the current situation is changing rapidly.

Japanese Troops Mobilized to Zhejiang along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road

Furthermore, in recent days, Japanese troops have been mobilized from Shanghai to Zhejiang in batches along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, numbering around tens of thousands. The Chinese side had already taken precautions and was waiting in full battle array. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 16th of this month, Japanese troops from Xiaoshan and Fuyang launched separate attacks. The Japanese troops in the Fuyang area were intercepted by Chinese troops at Dayuan, while the Japanese troops advancing eastward from Xiaoshan are in a stalemate with Chinese troops outside the western suburbs of Shaoxing. The Japanese troops in Zhuji also encountered strong Chinese forces at Sanchakou and have made no progress. The tense situation in eastern Zhejiang is within expectations. However, if the Japanese troops intend to seize eastern Zhejiang, it will not be an easy task in this mountainous area with deep valleys.

### Cadbury, Chairman of Jardine Matheson, Will Leave Shanghai for England Tomorrow.

Mr. Cadbury, Chairman of Jardine Matheson and former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, will leave Shanghai for England tomorrow (the 21st). Japanese Director Okamoto of the Shanghai Municipal Council issued a public letter praising Mr. Cadbury, stating that Mr. Cadbury can be called a leader of the citizens of Shanghai. Before his departure from Shanghai to return to England, he would like to express his gratitude to Mr. Cadbury on behalf of the foreign nationals of Shanghai. Fortunately, thanks to Mr. Cadbury's efforts, the future has gradually become brighter. Some of the problems encountered in the past few years seemed insurmountable. Fortunately, thanks to Mr. Cadbury's intelligence, patience, and understanding, they were resolved. He knows that Mr. Cadbury has many public and private affairs, and his hard work in serving the community is commendable.

### Holland Elected Chairman of the Royal Air Force Association

Sir Sassoon was the former Chairman of the Royal Air Force Association. With Sassoon himself in the United States, the Association's affairs were inevitably tense due to the British war effort. Therefore, the Association held its annual meeting this Friday and held elections. The meeting elected Holland as Chairman and Rogers as Vice Chairman. According to the Association, membership has increased by 30% compared to previous years, and the progress of affairs is quite impressive.

### The Head Office of the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks Orders the Shanghai Branch to Resume Business as Soon as Possible, and the Police Authorities Are Planning Strict Protection.

After the Shanghai branches of the Central, China, Communications, and China Farmers Banks temporarily suspended business, the Shanghai branches of the four banks negotiated and jointly telegraphed the head office for instructions. It is reported that the head office of the four banks, in order to maintain Shanghai's financial stability, has ordered the Shanghai branches to resume business as soon as possible, and has ordered the employees of the four banks to continue to serve the public, stating that they will continue to operate regardless of the circumstances, and have no intention of withdrawing the Shanghai branches. The Shanghai branches of the four banks are now preparing to resume business.

Researching Ways to Provide Proper Protection

According to the Continental News, a well-informed banking source told reporters yesterday (the 18th) that the four banks (Central, China, Communications, and Farmers) that closed on Thursday will resume business on Monday (the 21st) morning. It is also reported that the responsible personnel of the four banks are continuing to meet with the police authorities here to provide better protection for the employees. According to a responsible person from one of the banks, the four banks decided to close in order to arrange better protection for the employees, and there was no intention of suspending business indefinitely. After ordering the four banks to close on Thursday, the responsible personnel immediately telegraphed the head office in Chongqing for instructions.

### Changes to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Organization Await Approval from Treaty Powers. Some Difficulties Are Expected, and the Council Will Not Be Established in the Coming Week.

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, although the provisional board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council has been established, the current situation of the Council remains unchanged today (the 19th). The resolutions passed at the special ratepayers' meeting on Thursday (the 17th) are currently awaiting approval from the treaty powers in China. This morning, officials indicated that the countries concerned may respond to this issue in the coming days, but no definitive statement can be made at this time. At the same time, the resolution to make significant changes to the organization of the Municipal Council faces some difficulties. It is generally believed that the Chinese government in Chongqing is unlikely to approve the changes to the organization of the Municipal Council. It is generally pointed out that, according to the Land Regulations of the Foreign Concession, any changes to the legal status of the Public Concession must be approved not only by the treaty powers but also by the Chinese government. Therefore, the provisional board of directors will not be able to begin work in the coming week. However, the authorities of various countries here have telegraphed their governments to request approval of these new changes.

Engaging in Negotiations through Diplomatic Channels

Havas World News Agency, Chongqing, 19th - Regarding the issue of Chinese Directors on the Shanghai Municipal Council, the authorities here have made concessions, but insist on the originally selected candidates Yuan Lüdeng, Xi Yushu, Chen Tingrui, and Guo Shun. They will not recognize any other proposed lists and are currently negotiating with the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries through diplomatic channels. Until the issue is resolved, the four Directors will not attend meetings.

(1) Telegram from Wang Xiaolai and Xu Jiqing to the Shanghai Municipal Council: Regarding the case of temporarily approving the attendance of Yuan Lüdeng, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, and Chen Tingrui as Chinese Directors, the telegram was received. It has been reported that someone has been elected as a Chinese Director, which is surprising. Therefore, we solemnly declare that we do not recognize it. The current Chinese Directors should be handled in accordance with the telegram, and all six Chinese Committee members should continue in their positions. Please take note. Respectfully, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and Xu Jiqing, Vice Chairman.

(2) Telegram from Yu Qiaqing to Shanghai newspapers and all Chinese ratepayers in the Public Concession: It is noted that the position of Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association is currently held by Mr. Wang Xiaolai. It has been reported that someone has been elected as Chairman. This is legally unfounded. Furthermore, I, Yu Qiaqing, have been temporarily transferred to another location for recuperation due to gradually declining health. Please be aware. Respectfully, Yu Qiaqing.

(3) Telegram from Wang Xiaolai and Xu Jiqing: It is noted that the current five Chinese Directors and five Chinese Committee members, together with the Chairman and Vice Chairman of this Association, have been re-elected in accordance with the law. However, due to the number of Chinese Directors, the Western ratepayers requested the representatives of the relevant countries to China to request approval from our government to temporarily reduce the number from five to four. The Chairman and Vice Chairman then telegraphed the Council, stating that the Chinese Directors who attended the Council from 1941 to 1942 were lawfully selected by the representatives of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association's General Assembly: Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Lüdeng, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, and Chen Tingrui. According to the current Land Regulations, neither the candidates nor the number of seats can be changed. However, in order to adapt to the environment and demonstrate genuine cooperation with Western ratepayers, the five current Chinese Directors agreed to temporarily nominate Yuan Lüdeng, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, and Chen Tingrui to attend. This is a temporary measure, and we are reporting this for your information. It has been reported that someone has nominated Chinese Directors, Chinese Committee members, and the Chairman of this Association. We do not recognize this and have telegraphed the Council today to solemnly declare that the current Chinese Directors should be handled in accordance with the aforementioned telegram. In addition, all six Chinese Committee members should continue in their positions, and we are issuing this telegram to declare this. Please take note. Respectfully, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and Xu Jiqing, Vice Chairman.

### Founder of the World Alliance, Playte, Arrives in Shanghai

Playte, the founder of the "World Alliance Movement," recently arrived in Shanghai. He told reporters, "The World Alliance that I advocate is for local freedom and regional autonomy, and that each place should have a unified religion and cooperative system, with the village as the unit of the family. This method seems like communism, but it is actually a kind of collective living. Our goal is benevolence, compassion, and forgiveness. The nature of aggression should be suppressed. This is the true spirit of all religions. My purpose in coming to Shanghai is to contribute this plan to my Chinese brothers, but since Shanghai is an international city, I expect that other expatriates will also agree with my ideas."

### US Consulate Continues Evacuation

It has once again been rumored in Shanghai that the situation in the Far East has become tense due to the signing of the neutrality pact between the Soviet Union and Japan. Although diplomatic officials from a certain foreign country have refused to answer questions about the situation in the Far East becoming tense again, several authoritative foreigners told reporters from the Pingming News Agency that the future of the situation in the Far East remains uncertain. When asked about the evacuation of American expatriates in Shanghai at the US Consulate, a spokesperson for the Consulate said, "The US Consulate is continuing to process the evacuation of non-essential American expatriates from Shanghai." When the reporter asked whether the US Consul-General had protested the Japanese detention of gasoline from the Texaco oil company in Shanghai, the spokesperson said, "It is still under consideration." Finally, when asked about the US government's embargo on Japan, the spokesperson replied, "The US government's embargo includes Shanghai."

### After the Temporary Restriction on Rice Prices, Black Market Premiums Are Rampant, Requiring 500 Yuan per Hundred Bags of Rice.

The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association and the Grain, Oil, and Cake Industry Association jointly convened a meeting a few days ago, at which they assessed the selling prices of various grains. The industry association officially announced to the market yesterday, stating, "We have received an order from the Concession authorities stating that all transactions of various grains and goods in this market must not exceed the closing prices of April 16th. In addition to complying with the order to announce this to the market, we have also collected the closing prices of various grains on that day.

The prices examined and stipulated at the joint meeting of the 3rd Executive and Supervisory Committee of this association on the 18th of this month, taking into account the market situation on that day, are as follows (see newspaper reports): Transactions must be carried out within the above-mentioned stipulated prices and must not be exceeded. Anyone who dares to comply outwardly but disobey secretly, and raises market prices without authorization, will be reported to the authorities for investigation and prosecution according to law. This announcement is hereby issued, hoping that all will strictly abide by it. Since the Concession authorities ordered the relevant rice industry associations to find ways to suppress the prices of rice and grains, they have separately approved the selling prices and announced them to the market for implementation. However, those people are still holding on to their goods and refuse to sell, attempting to break through the price limits and daring to continue to use tricks, secretly engaging in illegal transactions in the market. Yesterday, black market premiums became even more rampant, requiring 500 yuan per hundred bags of rice. The prices assessed this time can be said to have reached the highest peak, but those people are still trying to raise prices, which is a serious concern for the entire food supply of Shanghai. We can only hope that the authorities will quickly take strict measures to punish them and restore credibility.

### The Labor Dispute Has Improved, and the Eyeglasses Industry Can Resume Work Today. The Datong Labor Dispute May Be Resolved.

More than two hundred eyeglass lens grinding workers submitted two demands to the employers on the 6th: (1) a 120% increase in wages, and (2) a rice subsidy of 40 yuan per month. As they did not receive a reply from the employers, they went on strike, which has lasted for half a month. After repeated consultations between labor and management, the labor side voluntarily complied with the agreement (when wages were increased three months ago, both sides agreed that no further wage increases would be requested) and cancelled the wage increase demand. The rice subsidy issue has also been reduced by 15 yuan. The employers can generally accept this, and it is hoped that a complete resolution can be reached today, and work can resume as usual.

The labor dispute at the Datong Tobacco Factory has lasted for many days. It is understood that the factory's usual treatment of workers is relatively good. The workers' situation during the strike has been quite good, with no accidents or extraordinary activities. The Concession authorities are currently mediating the demands for a 20% wage increase and a daily rice subsidy of one sheng. According to the responsible party at the factory, it is currently nearing the moldy season, and there is usually no need to start work. However, considering the livelihood of the entire workforce, they will quickly find a way to resolve the issue. After negotiations between the two sides within the next few days, it is hoped that a resolution can be reached and work can resume.

### The Quantity of the French Concession's Electricity Price Increase Will Be Officially Announced Next Week. The Municipal Council's Reduction Is Awaiting a Decision from the French Consul-General, But the Residents within the Concession Still Find the Increase Unaffordable.

The French Concession Electricity Company previously requested the French Municipal Council to approve a certain percentage increase in electricity and power fees within the Concession. The French Municipal Council accepted the company's request for a 41% increase for consideration and held a meeting on the 15th to discuss it. However, the result of the meeting was to approve a 25% increase in electricity fees. It is understood that the method of increasing electricity fees is expected to be announced next Monday or Tuesday at the latest. This news was obtained from senior officials of the French Municipal Council. The official stated that the increase in electricity fees would not exceed 25%. However, the French Concession Electricity Company's price increase is now the third such increase, and it is awaiting the final decision of the French Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Magre. However, the general residents all feel that the burden is too heavy and are appealing for further consideration.

Public Opinion Should Be Taken Into Account

According to the Shanghai Times, Mr. Plamé, a French lawyer in Shanghai, stated that he sympathized with the French Electricity Company's problems of fuel shortages and high expenses, but the principle of public affairs is to serve the public, and this point should be considered first. Therefore, the French Electricity Company should reconsider from this perspective. According to the law, users must be notified of electricity price increases one month in advance and must not be implemented at any time. The electricity restriction measures announced last month will be implemented starting this month. If users exceed their limit by the end of this month, they must reduce their electricity consumption in May to make up for the excess in this month, or we will cut off their electricity. This method is also wrong in principle.

The Company Is Responsible for Obtaining Materials

The company can ask users not to waste electricity, but it must not cut off electricity. The company is responsible for using various methods, such as renting ships from American, Dutch, and Japanese companies, to ensure a continuous supply of fuel. It cannot attribute the problem to difficulties. In short, electricity restrictions should be kept to a minimum, and essential supplies should not be restricted. Industrial electricity consumption should not be interfered with, otherwise there will be serious repercussions for social welfare. Industrial electricity consumption in the French Concession accounts for only four-tenths of the total electricity consumption, which is less than half of the proportion of industrial electricity consumption in the Public Concession.

### Zhu Changhai Is Still Not Out of Danger

Zhu Changhai, the foreman of the Great American Evening Post's printing room, was shot and wounded at the intersection of Avenue Haig and Chengdu Road on the afternoon of the 17th of this month. After being sent to the hospital for treatment, his condition was still good. However, he had a slight fever yesterday morning. Because the bullet remained in his body and had not been removed, he needs to have another X-ray taken this morning to examine the location of the bullet in detail in order to decide whether or not to perform surgery. Therefore, he has not yet been able to escape danger.

### The Report of German Paratrooper Instructors Arriving in Shanghai Is Unconfirmed

Shanghai Special Dispatch from the Hai Tong News Agency: Regarding the report on the 17th of this month stating, "We have learned from well-informed sources that several German Gestapo officials and paratrooper instructors have recently arrived in Shanghai," and that paratrooper exercises have been held in the past few days, Western newspapers later reprinted the report. The German Consul-General in Shanghai has authorized the Hai Tong News Agency to deny that the report is untrue and does not conform to the facts.

### The Aurora Photographic Society's Public Health Photography Exhibition Is Open for the Last Day Today.

In order to instill health knowledge and promote the health of the city's residents, the Aurora University Photographic Society held a public health photography exhibition, which opened on the 11th. The exhibition was originally scheduled for five days, but due to the unusually large crowds, the society had to extend the exhibition for five days at the request of all sectors of society. It is said that in the past few days, the total number of visitors has reached 60,000, mainly students from large, medium, and small schools in the city and housewives. Today is the last day of the exhibition, which is open all day and does not sell tickets. The hours are from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM. There will be no further extensions. People from all walks of life should not miss this rare opportunity. The exhibition is located at Aurora University on Rue Lupan.

### Huge Supply of Hongji Coal to Shanghai, Coal Briquette Prices Fell Slightly Yesterday

Yesterday, coal prices in the market fell slightly due to a large supply of Hongji coal spot goods. The selling price was more than 370 yuan per ton. Also, because Hongji coal is the main raw material for making coal briquettes, the prices of coal briquettes also fell from 16 yuan to 15 yuan per dan at several coal briquette factories.

### Report by the General Manager of the Public Works Department, Mr. Keylock: Report on Administrative Overview (4) – Speech Delivered at the Foreign Ratepayers' Meeting

Education Funding Exceeds Six Million

The budget for education expenses this year is $6,066,080, an increase of $2,831,110 over last year. It is noted that this expense was previously stipulated not to exceed 2% of the total land tax revenue, but it has gradually increased in recent years. The Board of Directors has paid attention to this. Generally speaking, this type of burden should be considered more a national responsibility than a municipal one.

This Year’s Revenue and Expenditure Still Show a Deficit

The revenue and expenditure for this year offset each other, resulting in a deficit of $2,443,170. To make up for this, it is proposed to transfer $1.5 million from the general reserve fund. After offsetting, the remaining deficit is $943,170. The New Tax Source Committee is still continuing its deliberations to study ways to increase revenue. However, it should be noted that the above budget is based on an exchange rate of 3.5 shillings and a rice price of $87 per dan.

Temporary Expenses Exceed Ten Million

Various temporary expenses for this year are estimated to require $10,382,630. Temporary income is estimated at approximately $10,050,000. After offsetting revenue and expenditure, there is a deficit of $33,630, which is proposed to be carried over to the next year’s calculation. This year, $5,537,100 is required for debt repayment and pension investments. Various major temporary expenditures and emergency measures expenses are estimated to require $2,813,070. Temporary education expenses are estimated to require $196,920. As for temporary income, $1 million is planned to come from the sale of the Bureau’s surplus assets, and $50,000 from miscellaneous income. To meet this budget, the General Meeting should authorize the Bureau to either issue new public bonds or use other appropriate methods to raise funds not exceeding a total of $9 million.

Efforts to Eliminate Terrorist Actions

In the latter half of last month, shocking terrorist acts and counter-terrorist actions occurred in this city. I believe that no one is helped by terrorist methods. Those who adopt such weapons suffer even more damage than their enemies. I can only appeal to all parties concerned to do their best to assist the public security organs in curbing this threat to the citizens.

### Last Year’s Finances – Motion 6

I now ask the gentlemen of the General Meeting to pay attention to the Bureau's published overview of last year's finances and the report of the Director of Finance. The estimated deficit in last year's recurring expenses budget was approximately $5,573,280. However, due to the frequent increases in the cost of living throughout the year, the Bureau’s temporary living allowances for staff were increased three times in May, October, and December of last year. Furthermore, the cost of all manpower and materials increased sharply, resulting in a final deficit of $9,084,020.

Six Percent Bonds Used to Offset Deficit

The temporary expenses budget for last year originally included an item for covering the estimated deficit in recurring expenses. Therefore, a portion of the $16 million in six percent bonds issued last year will be used to offset this deficit. These bonds are repaid every six months, with full repayment over ten years. The principal repayment of the bonds is borne under the recurring expenses revenue item. Therefore, the deficit listed in last year’s recurring expenses budget will in fact be fully cleared within ten years.

Recurring Deficit Actually Exceeds Nine Million

Furthermore, the recurring expenses deficit of $9,084,020 for last year has all been covered by the temporary expenses item. However, the difference between the budgeted deficit and the actual deficit should be addressed within this year. (End)

### American President Liners to Resume Two-Way Voyages to Shanghai – SS President Taft Sails from Los Angeles to Shanghai – Returns to This City via Manila

Since the reorganization and resumption of voyages by the American President Lines, apart from the SS President Coolidge, which continues to follow its original route, the other President liners, such as the SS President Jackson, SS President Pierce, SS President Taft, and SS President Cleveland, have been making one-way voyages to this city. For example, they depart from America, pass through Japan, go directly to Hong Kong and Manila.

They do not come to Shanghai, but on the return trip from Manila, they come to Shanghai via Hong Kong and dock, then return to America via Japan; or they come from the eastern United States, pass through Shanghai to Hong Kong and Manila, and on the return trip from Manila, they go directly to Japan via Hong Kong and return to America. There has been no change for two years. Now, according to the company's announcement, the shipping routes may be changed, with the possibility of resuming two-way voyages to this city. The SS President Taft, which departed from Los Angeles on the 14th of this month, is scheduled to return to America via Hong Kong and Shanghai on May 17th, according to the original itinerary. The ship will now implement the resumption of services to the city

Two-way voyages will begin on the 8th of next month from Los Angeles via San Francisco, Honolulu, Yokohama, Kobe, and Shanghai, to Hong Kong and Manila, and then return to America via Shanghai on the return trip from Manila. As for the other ships, whether they will follow the SS President Taft's itinerary has not been officially announced, so the sailing schedule is also uncertain.

### Revised Airmail Rates

A notice from the Postal Administration states that, starting April 21st, all airmail destined for various parts of Japan, North China, Central China, and South China will be subject to the following revised airmail rates (ordinary postage and registration fees are not included): (1) For airmail transported by the Nanjing-Shanghai-Japan air route or the Shanghai-Dalian air route, the airmail rate for letters to Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Kwantung Leased Territory, and other Japanese territories will be 70 cents per 20 grams or fraction thereof, and 36 cents per postcard. Other postal items will be $1.50 per 60 grams or fraction thereof. (2) For airmail transported by the Shanghai-Nanjing-Beiping air route to North China, by the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hankou air route to Central China (up to Hankou), and by the Shanghai-Guangzhou air route and the Guangzhou-Shantou air route and the Guangzhou-Wuzhou air route to South China, the airmail rate for letters will be 40 cents per 20 grams or fraction thereof, and 20 cents per postcard.

### Today is Russian Easter – Grand Prayer Ceremony Held

While foreign expatriates in Shanghai have already commemorated Easter, the Russian expatriates in Shanghai will follow suit today with a grand memorial ceremony, rarely seen in recent years. As a result, Russian shops are uniformly displaying goods inside the windows at bargain prices to mark the occasion. Starting last night, the Russian Orthodox Church on Henry Road held a grand prayer ceremony, which was extremely crowded. It is expected that the number of Russian expatriates participating in today's continuation of the ceremony will be large. The prayer ceremony will conclude at midnight, led by Pastor John, who will also deliver a speech. The Russian expatriates present will express their loyalty and kiss each other three times. Then, each will carry a candle and walk home, indicating "fire safety." This practice is a long-standing custom of the Russians. Every year on this day, all the Russians host banquets at their residences.

### USS Wake Returns to Port

The USS Wake, a U.S. Yangtze River gunboat, returned to Shanghai yesterday from a patrol of Wuhu on the Yangtze River and is anchored at the French Concession Bund pontoon. The USS Luzon remains anchored at the Central Navy pontoon. It is understood that the movements of the Yangtze River gunboats are routine patrols out of the Songkou.

### Aid to Fellow Countrymen Suffering from Addiction – Weiguang Hospital Offers Free Opium Addiction Treatment – Provisionally Limited to Fifteen People in Five Phases

Weiguang Hospital, located at Simingli, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lupan, Shanghai, feels deeply sorry for fellow countrymen in Shanghai who are addicted to drugs and unable to quit. It has made a grand vow to provide free opium addiction treatment, temporarily limited to fifteen people. The hospital sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday stating: "We humbly report that Mr. Wang from Hankou has come to our hospital for opium addiction treatment and has now broken his addiction. Mr. Wang voluntarily donated $1,000 to our hospital to treat ten impoverished opium addicts on his behalf. This shows Mr. Wang's generosity and is truly rare. Our hospital is also willing to sacrifice its spirit and medicine costs to increase the number of free opium addiction treatment slots by five to promote and fulfill the practical duty of saving fellow countrymen. However, due to the overwhelming number of applicants, even with the establishment of a sanatorium, we still feel crowded. Therefore, the above fifteen people must be treated in five weeks, with three people each week.

### Six Chinese and Japanese Nationals Extort Rongchang Iron Factory – Changchong Military Department Investigates – Extortionists Arrested Together

Yesterday morning around 9 a.m., several Chinese and Japanese nationals suddenly entered Rongchang Copper and Iron Factory at No. 20, Lane 1603, Jing'an Temple Road, accusing the factory of helping Yibade Electric Materials Company at No. 180, Guangdong Road, manufacture wireless electrical machinery parts and components, and that Yibade was specifically supplying military electricity to the Chongqing government. They demanded to arrest the person in charge to go to the Japanese military department for investigation. However, if they could pay $3,000, there would be room for negotiation. The factory immediately telegraphed the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched detective Lu Subao and a Japanese detective. They arrested Japanese nationals Mori Kumao, Kodama Tomesou, and Matsuo Yoshihiro, as well as Chinese nationals Chen Yimin, Gu Agen, and Tang Yuelin, and took them all to the police station. It was found that the three Japanese nationals were not military personnel, but were impersonating military personnel and extorting money. They were sent to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation. Chen Yimin and the other two were ordered to be detained and sent to Criminal Court No. 11 of the Special First Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case, requesting permission for detention. Judge Liu approved the detention pending a retrial on the 16th.

### Dispute Arises While Refueling Car – One Party Claims Gun Threat – Other Party Sues for Injury in Court

Zhang Minsheng, residing at a certain number in Lafayette Lane, Route Lafayette, French Concession, was formerly a judge of the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court and is now unemployed at home. At 10 p.m. on the 8th of last month, Zhang, along with friends Ma Xinsheng and Wu Ruisheng, returned in Wu's own car number 34 after going out for a drive. At that time, there were also two women in the car, one of whom was Luo Guifang, a recently arrived dancer from Hong Kong. When the car reached the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Methurst Road, the gasoline ran out. They stopped at an Asia Oil Station at the intersection to refuel 15 gallons. At that time, the station employee Li Yuanqing was careless when refueling, causing a lot of spillage on the ground. When Wu paid, he only agreed to pay for 10 gallons, and a dispute arose between the two parties. Afterwards, Li suddenly reported to the police station, claiming that Zhang had threatened him with a gun at the time. The police are investigating. Wu's driver, Zhong Xiangjin, suddenly filed a complaint with the Special First Court, accusing Li of injury and other crimes, and filed a civil suit for $250 in medical expenses. The case was tried in court by Judge Meng. After a detailed trial, it was scheduled for a suitable date.

### Dazhong News Agency Statement – Denounces Distribution of Propaganda

Both were returned because the recipients had already moved. The envelopes used were printed with "Dazhong News Agency, Hengyeli, Rue Doumer" which is also fake.

### The Value of a Person

— Jiang Shui

How much is a person actually worth? Let's first take a look at the estimates of two scientists. One said: The carbohydrates in a person's body are worth $24, the bones and fat are worth $2.30 each, the phosphorus is worth $1.50, the sugar is worth $1, the sulfur is worth $0.50, the salt is worth $0.30, and other things like iron and hair are worth $1.10, for a total of only $33. Another said: A person weighing 140 pounds contains 10 gallons of water, and the fat they contain can make seven bars of soap, the carbon can make 900 pencils, the phosphorus can make 2,200 matches, the iron can make a medium-sized nail, the magnesium can make a dose of salt, the limestone can paint a chicken coop white, and the sulfur can kill all the fleas on a dog. According to his estimates, it adds up to only five shillings. After looking at these numbers, we will naturally feel inferior: "Ah, it's a pity, I didn't expect a dignified person to be worth only a few dollars!" Some people may become pessimistic and negative, saying: "Life is really worthless!"

Is a person really worthless? Are they really only worth a few dollars? I want to tell everyone that a person is a "priceless treasure", something greater and more precious than the world. Listen, Stevenson invented the train, and Fulton invented the steamboat, which shrunk the world. Edison invented the electric light, which made us all jump out of the darkness. What is history after all? It is originally a biography of great people, recording only the deeds of those people who once shook the earth - human development has no limits! The future of human beings is truly limitless!

I can tell you another story: One day I asked a little brother in the park, I said to him: "Dear, how much are you worth?" He looked at me, seemingly very curious. I asked him again, "Is it $100? Can I buy you for $100?" He then smiled and replied: "$100 is too cheap!" So I increased the number, from $100 to $500, $1,000, $10,000, $100,000, and when I got to $500,000, he seemed a little moved. He blurted out: "Okay, I'll sell you for $500,000, as long as you bring the cash!" Everyone, is he only worth $500,000? No, absolutely not, he was fooled, he underestimated his own value too much.

How much are Stevenson and Edison worth? $33? Five shillings, $100? $100,000? $500,000? In fact, we cannot give a made-up number to measure their value.

Everyone, how much is your value? I hope you don't say that you are only worth $33. Or even like that little brother who said that he could sell you for only $500,000. Your future is limitless. Never be as ordinary as those common people, coming and going just as ordinary! There is a blank space in history waiting to be written with your glorious, great success! (This article is based on notes taken after listening to a speech by Dr. Jiang Changchuan)

### The Consolation of American Walnuts

— Yu Wen

This was a very rare opportunity. On the morning of the 14th of this month, the Cilian Refugee Children's Primary School on North Zhejiang Road received over 200 boxes of gifts sent from the United States. Brought from distant America to the Far East, that kind of deep affection truly made people feel supremely happy, and imprinted the great friendship between mankind on the hearts of thousands of refugee children. They care about our China, care about a group of homeless refugee children. This kind of friendly consolation shows how much the children of China and America love each other.

Those gifts were all rectangular boxes, with the red words of the American Red Cross's consolation printed on them, and the handwritten signatures and addresses of students from elementary schools in various provinces were written below. Some had beautiful flowers drawn on the boxes, some had the words "China" written in crayon, and even more had the words "Victory" written. The boxes were all filled with walnuts of various sizes, lined with brightly colored paper. From this, we can imagine how innocent and sincere their childish hearts are, and how much they sympathize with our China.

These walnuts were all personally donated by American children, sent from the American Red Cross to Hong Kong, and then a portion was distributed from Hong Kong to Shanghai. In the West, walnuts symbolize happiness. At the same time, the fruit of the walnut is so strong, the meaning is truly profound. This has at least some encouraging meaning for the refugee children. Therefore, we must not only thank them for their kindness, but I also hope that all the children in Shanghai will also extend a friendly consolation to the many refugee children in the wars of Europe.

### A Record of a Little Artist

— Hu Yaguang

The little artist's surname is Liu, given name Bingbao, from Nanxun. He is eleven years old this year, very clever. Because his body is weak, he studies at home. He loves art. At the age of seven or eight, he already drew very well. Things like warships, airplanes, and cars all look very realistic, especially cars, which are his specialty. He only started formally learning to paint at the age of nine. In less than a few months, he became quite impressive and progressed very quickly. He can create both watercolor paintings and comics. His brushwork and coloring for landscape paintings are vigorous and delightful. He is indeed a little artist with great talent. His personality is very lively and innocent. When he paints, he is bold and meticulous, possessing both qualities. Adults are generally amazed when they see his works. He has parents who love him very much. Besides them, he has two younger sisters and one older brother. The family is harmonious and quite happy. In addition to drawing, he also plays the piano and can play several songs. Now, he has organized his artwork from the past few years and is preparing to hold a small art exhibition to study with other children. The watercolor painting above is one example of his work.

### The Public Performance of the Children's Theater Troupe

— Xishi

I never expected to have this exciting opportunity in this dull period; of course, it was bestowed by the Children's Theater Troupe.

When I set out on the road, I thought that this trip would be nothing more than starting out with enthusiasm and returning with disappointment. Unexpectedly, on the way back, I would recall that my previous assumptions were wrong; their performance was indeed meaningful; they are worthy of being the most historical children's theater troupe in Shanghai. It is worth a delightful watch.

Today is their fourth public performance. The repertoire was originally scheduled to be "Children's Day", "The Pimp Shop", and "The Ape King". Now, because the actor in "The Pimp Shop" has returned to his hometown, it has been temporarily changed to "Dormitory Night Scene"; that is very regrettable.

When I walked into the gate of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, I felt that the room was filled with a new vitality; because I had already seen the children serving in the venue, their lively spirit is a good symbol of their pure hearts.

When the first play opened, it showed the innocence of children and reflected the class differences between the rich and the poor. The play reached its climax through the conflicts and reconciliations between the rich and the poor. Other aspects, such as the headmaster's reply and Jia Hui's kindness, were all moving to the audience. Most of the actors were competent. The insertion of the low-priced rice segment was very good.

The second play was set against the background of a certain girls' middle school, severely criticizing the "commercial education" of "money worship" and the dark secrets of the classmates. It fully exposed the "shapes of the isolated island."

The third play, "The Ape King," a two-act play, although adapted from a fairy tale, contained profound metaphors of dispelling superstition and resisting violence, which are very suitable for the current trend. When the Ape King appeared, it was indeed able to strongly grip the audience's heartstrings, and not just in terms of the vivid appearance.

Finally, it is gratifying that such a healthy children's theater troupe can emerge on this "turbid" isolated island. I hope they can further expand their efforts to develop their careers, break through the darkness, and seek light with great effort, always make progress, and strive to have more exciting and meaningful performances in the future, and achieve endless results.

### Glider

— Lin Ren

For several consecutive days, newspapers have been publishing similar news about "Chongqing's vigorous promotion of glider sports," such as a passage on the sixth of this month: "The Chongqing Municipal Journalists Association initiated the raising of funds for a glider, and has appointed an election team to set up a fundraising committee to take charge of the matter." This news caught A Liang's eye, and immediately resonated: "What is a glider? Is it a type of airplane? Can it carry people and goods?..." A series of questions rose and fell in his mind, and he even asked his father to teach him.

"Gliding is still a new sport in our country. It is a pity that in the past, the authorities did not promote it, so it did not attract people's attention. What is a glider? This kind of glider can be made by oneself. It does not use an airplane's engine, but it is very similar to an airplane. It relies entirely on rising air currents to fly for several hours in the high sky of four or five thousand meters, just like a bird flying in the sky. This is a popular sport abroad, and people are very interested in it because the structure of this kind of aircraft is also very simple. It can be made in one or two months according to a certain blueprint. Except for the lightweight canvas used for the two wings and the steel used for the key parts, the rest of the fuselage is made entirely of wood, so the weight is very light. Then, a rope about five or six hundred meters long is tightly tied to the steel bar behind the car. Then, the car is slowly driven, and the fuselage gradually takes off. In the beginning of practice, it can only rise one or two feet. After practicing like this more than ten times, if the driver in the aircraft can maintain balance up and down, left and right, then he can make a horizontal flight of fifty to one hundred meters. How to land at a designated location? And how to make turning and spiral flights? These are necessary skills. As the driver's skills gradually improve, the altitude can also gradually increase, from fifty, one hundred to more than three hundred meters. At this time, the car is still used for towing. Later, when it rises to a considerable height, the long rope is released. This is still preliminary practice. During the formal flight, a more sophisticated glider is used instead of the training aircraft. Its structure is not inferior to that of an airplane. It also has a speedometer, altimeter, rate-of-climb indicator, compass and other equipment, but there is no machine, but it uses the action of air currents. A glider that can fly for several hours has particularly long and sharp wings, like a big bird, and the driver is completely enclosed inside, just like driving a car. The glider's ability to fly relies entirely on rising air currents. It is like the eagles flying that we usually see. Its wings do not move, but it hovers and gradually rises. The glider is also like this, so it can be said to be a 'man-made eagle.' Glider navigation is a sport, not a means of transportation, so it cannot transport goods or carry passengers. As for what air currents are, I don't think you understand it very well! Air current is the abbreviation of air flow, which is the same as the flow of river water, but unfortunately, air currents cannot be seen. There are several types of air currents. Some are moving forward and are reversed when they encounter the obstruction of high mountains, or they rise due to huge waves. If the glider driver happens to be over the high mountains, he can rise. Or, because the sun shines on the shaded areas of the ground, the hot air on the ground rises, forming a thermal current that can reach four or five thousand meters, so gliders can also make good flights on flat ground without high mountains. Anyone who can fly a glider will not have any problems with flying an airplane, so the popularity of glider sports can promote people's interest in aviation."

### Hollywood in the Midst of Conscription

— Mingming

Since October 16 of last year, the United States has begun an unprecedented large-scale conscription movement in history. Men between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-five are obliged to serve in the military for the country. When this news reached Hollywood, several film companies enthusiastically expressed their willingness to help the government shoot propaganda films for military service. Paramount is currently producing the film "Caught in The Draft" (starring Dorothy Lamour and Bob Hope), and Republic's ("You'll Never Get Rich") are both comedies that use the theme of promoting military service. Darryl Zanuck, manager of 20th Century Fox, is also preparing to bring the life of the barracks to the screen. On the other hand, MGM's great director W. S. Van Dyke recently joined the 22nd Marine Reserve Battalion. Following James Stewart, actors Lee Bowman and Sterling Holloway have also officially enlisted. From this, it can be seen that the conscription movement has a significant impact on the movie city.

Recently, the most frequently heard topics in Hollywood conversations are: "Will Errol Flynn serve in the military?" "What about Clark Gable?" "And Tyrone Power?" Indeed, movie fans are most concerned about the stars, so whether male stars serve in the military and when they serve are particularly noteworthy.

In fact, Clark Gable (39 years old), Nelson Eddy, Gary Cooper, Brian Aherne (38 years old), Fred Astaire, Spencer Tracy (40 years old), and Pande O'Brien (41 years old) have all exceeded the age of military service. George Brent, Bruce Cabot, James Cagney, Bing Crosby, Ralph Bellamy, Lloyd Nolan, George Raft, Robert Montgomery, and other stars have just passed their 36th birthdays, so they no longer need to serve in the military.

Moreover, "Little Genius" Mischa Auer, wrote down his age as thirty-five on the form submitted to the draft office. Four weeks later, he was one year older. Dick Powell wrote his age as thirty-five years and eleven months, so his period of service was extremely short. Jackie Cooper, Jean Reynolds, and Little Henry, these stars who are under the age of twenty-one, are not eligible. The movie emperor Miguel Nasser will not turn twenty-one until September of this year, and neither will Dean Hall. In fact, with Miguel's height of five feet two inches and weight of one hundred and twenty-seven pounds, he would be eliminated even if he were twenty-one years old. And Dean Hall has a wife and children, and the whole family depends on his income to maintain their livelihood, so he does not need to serve in the military.

Many stars, although within the age of military service, are exempt from service for certain reasons. For example, John Howard in "The Philadelphia Story" is too thin; Jeff Chandler's weight is not up to standard; Burgess Meredith only weighs one hundred and thirty-four pounds, and his height is also not up to standard; Andy Devine is too fat; Cesar Romero is too thin and tall. There are also Zachary Scott, Dennis Morgan, Fred MacMurray, Ray Milland, Robert Preston, Franchot Tone, Don Ameche, Dick Foran, Van Heflin Jr., John Garfield, John Weissmuller, Robert Young, William Gargan, Errol Flynn, John Wayne, Robert Cummings, Lee J. Cobb, and Bob Hope all have families and wives and need to solve the problem of living, so they are exempted from military service.

Only the following movie stars have the obligation and qualification to serve in the military: James Stewart, Victor Mature, William Holden, Tony Martin, Franchot Tone, Eddie Albert, Cary Grant, Robert Stack, Francis Lederer, and Louis Hayward.

### "Spinning Cotton" Becomes Popular in Peiping

— Chu

Since Wu Suqiu rose to fame with "Spinning Cotton", it seems that every Kunqu actress who comes north must perform it. This play is promoted with "gags", just like Lin Shusen's "Theater Fan Biography", not only must they "imitate one like one", but they must also have a slight understanding of Bangbang Opera, Henan Ballad, and even "When Will You Return". However, it is said that no one in the north imitates this play. Wu Suqiu returned to the north and performed the "Shanghai version" of "Spinning Cotton" in Peiping, which was indeed quite popular. Tong Zhiling, a star disciple of Xun Huisheng who sang in the Golden Age, also has this signature play. Since Wu Suqiu performed it first, she naturally refused to lag behind. She performed this play at the Guangde Theater in Peiping on the evening of the thirteenth of this month, and it is said that Tong Zhiling's Henan Ballad "Jade Hall Spring" was greatly appreciated by the audience. I think in the future, the play "Spinning Cotton" may be listed as a "starter play" for actors coming from the south. (The picture shows Tong Zhiling's "Hongni Pass")

### A Once Glorious "Photo Star" Has Now Left the Film Industry Due to Lung Disease

### Zhao Kuangyin Escorts Jingniang a Thousand Miles

— Jing

"Escorting Jingniang a Thousand Miles" is an old play that all Hui, Han, and Ping classes have. The Hui and Ping classes have a red-painted face playing Zhao Kuangyin, and the Han class has a supporting actor playing Emperor Taizu of Song. In the past forty years, this play has rarely been performed. Only in the south, after Xiao San Mazi and others rehearsed "The Legend of the Flying Dragon" at the old Xin'geng Theater in Zhabei, the play "Escorting Jingniang a Thousand Miles" became commonly seen again. In addition to Xiao San Mazi, southern actors such as Chen Xiaomu, Liu Wenkui, Zhao Xusheng, Bai Shu'an, Sun Bailing, Yang Yukun, Wang Linkun, Wang Chunbai, Yang Baotong, Chen Hefeng, Liu Hanchen, Zhang Delu, Liu Wuli, and Yu Zhanyuan all have this play. Not only does Peking Opera have this play in Shanghai, but also Shaoxing Opera, Reformed Shen Opera, Shaoxing Big Class, Wuxi Tanchun, and Changzhou Tanchun can also perform this play. To cater to the psychology of Shanghai audiences, Yi Hua Film Company even filmed a "Escorting Jingniang a Thousand Miles" this year, which was shown continuously for more than a month at the Guolian Grand Theater, which shows that this story has a considerable impression among the people.

I watched the old Xin'geng Theater perform "The Legend of the Flying Dragon", "Escorting Jingniang a Thousand Miles", the emphasis is not on Zhao Kuangyin escorting Jingniang a thousand miles, but on Zhao Jingniang's ghost haunting the righteous brother (Kuangyin) on a moonlit night. The background is night, there is no light on the stage, and only a few silver stars are visible on the curtain, emitting a dark green light on the moon tower, concentrating on Zhao Kuangyin and Zhao Jingniang's bodies; singing in the Lianchan tune, to the extreme of sorrow and magnificence, which can stir up the emotions of the audience.

However, according to the Ming Dynasty miscellaneous drama "The Meeting of Wind and Clouds", Jingniang did not die, and later became Zheng En's wife! Here is a brief account of the story:

During the Zhou Shizong period, there was someone in Tokyo who sold an iron-fetal bow. No one could draw it. Zheng En was the only one who could open it, and he was quite proud of himself. Emperor Taizu of Song happened to pass by the place, and he pulled it and broke it. En was greatly shocked and sighed, willing to serve Zhao as an elder brother, and swore to the gods before parting. After En left Zhao, he was depressed and could not restrain himself. When he was on his way to Qingniu Temple, he had a dream at night that the god gave him a dragon flute, and also said that his life's marriage and official position would all begin from this, and he must go to Zhao Xin quickly. En and Xin were both from the same hometown and had ancestral connections. Before that, Zhao Xin prayed to the Dragon Mountain God because he lacked an heir. He adopted Jingniang, and when Jingniang grew up, he led her to Dragon Mountain to offer incense and pay her vows with a pair of dragon flutes. On the way back, she encountered two thieves named Full Sky Flies and Land Rolling, who robbed Jingniang and sent her to Qingniu Temple. The abbot was Emperor Taizu's younger uncle. At that time, Taizu was recuperating in the temple. In the middle of the night, he heard a woman sobbing. He inquired about the reason, killed the two thieves, took Jingniang out, and carried her on his own horse to send her to Xin's place. Xin wanted to betroth his daughter to him, but Zhao politely declined and left. En arrived at Xin's place. Xin saw the flute that En was carrying and knew everything about it. He promised Jingniang to En. En thought that the god's words had already been fulfilled, so he wanted to go and join Taizu. He left Xin and went straight away. One day, he heard the sound of battle on the road. It turned out that Taizu was fighting with the Dong family's five tigers. The five tigers surrounded Taizu, and the situation was very difficult. En broke in, attacked the five tigers, and killed them all. They went to the capital together. After the Chenqiao Mutiny, Taizu became emperor, and En wore the vanguard seal. He made many meritorious deeds in battle and married Jingniang as his wife.

Chapter VII: Sieging Cities and Killing Generals, How Chaotic

Li Xin regained his freedom. Taking a few steps forward, he said to Hong Niangzi, "I am very grateful to you for coming to rescue me. It is hateful that the dog official intended to frame me. How did you know I was here?" Hong Niangzi said, "That's for later. We must quickly get out of prison. Please follow me." Li Xin did not dare to neglect and immediately followed Hong Niangzi out of the place where he was chained. Outside was a courtyard. A round moon shone brightly on the courtyard. Li Xin saw two watchmen's corpses in the corner of the east wall, stiffly standing. Li Xin asked, "Did you end their lives?" Hong Niangzi nodded and said, "Exactly. Otherwise, how would I know the place where you are imprisoned? We must quickly get out of prison. There are more than two thousand strong men from our mountain ambushing in front of the county government. They all came into the city with me to make a move. My elder brother may arrive in a moment." After saying that, she took out a signal cannon from her pocket, lit it, and with a loud bang, the more than two thousand strong men from Qing Shishan ambushing on the left and right in front of the county government, hearing the signal cannon, knew that Hong Niangzi had succeeded in the prison. They all shouted in unison and pulled out short knives from their sides, killing their way into the county government. Hong Niangzi opened all the doors in the prison, rescued all the prisoners, and shouted loudly, "Hong Niangzi of Qing Shishan is here! Quickly follow me to kill your way out of prison!" Most of the prisoners were desperadoes. Taking this opportunity, they all started fighting, banging and clanging, making a big noise in the prison and setting a fire. The prison guards and several wardens rushed to hear the news, how could they stop it! They were quickly knocked to the ground by Hong Niangzi. She and Li Xin were the first to kill their way out of the prison gate, joining forces with the strong men from her mountain. Just as they were about to leave the prison, Li Xin suddenly said to Hong Niangzi, "Please wait a moment. I want to go and settle the score with that dog official." Hong Niangzi nodded. She took a Pudao sword from a strong man's hand and handed it to Li Xin. Li Xin took it in his hand and ran with Hong Niangzi into the inner hall to find the Qixian magistrate. At this time, it was already past three o'clock. The Qixian magistrate was awakened in his sleep. Hearing that someone was robbing the prison, he hurriedly put on his clothes and got up. (43)
