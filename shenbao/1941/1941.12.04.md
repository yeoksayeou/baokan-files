### Roosevelt Poses Questions to Japan Regarding Troop Increase in Vietnam, Demands Prompt and Clear Response, Sees Japanese Action as Hindrance to Negotiations

United Press International, Washington, 3rd - President Roosevelt announced yesterday that he had questioned the Japanese government as to why it had dispatched a number of land, sea, and air forces to Vietnam that exceeded the number stipulated in the agreement with Vichy. The President told reporters that Under Secretary of State Welles had conveyed this request to the Japanese envoy in Washington, inquiring about the purpose and intention of Japan's dispatch of troops to Vietnam. President Roosevelt stated that he naturally could not accept that the Japanese troop dispatch was for police work, as Vietnam is currently very peaceful. The President said that the request did not have a time limit, but he hoped Japan would respond within a short period. When the President answered reporters' questions about the situation in Japan, President Roosevelt recalled that the U.S.-Japan negotiations began in April, and the U.S. objective was to maintain lasting peace throughout the Pacific. He said that when negotiations seemed to be progressing, the U.S. also attempted to avoid any actions that would violate this peace objective. Therefore, he was extremely surprised that Japan dispatched troops to Vietnam in June after very simple negotiations with Vichy. He said that the French and Japanese sides had already compromised on the number of troops at that time, and Vichy agreed only because the number of troops was incapable of any other action. U.S. government authorities also claimed that President Roosevelt had received information from various sources stating that Japan had recently dispatched a large number of troops to Vietnam, and many more troops were en route. President Roosevelt declined to answer the question of what the U.S. would do if Japan entered Thailand. He did not explain in words, but indicated that he believed the Japanese military's actions in Vietnam were an obstacle to continuing the Washington negotiations.

Reuters, Washington, 3rd - Under Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that President Roosevelt had posed several questions to Japan and expected a prompt response. These questions are not a "note of ultimatum." Welles did not further discuss the nature of these questions. According to diplomatic observers, they likely included a request to explain the rationale behind the Japanese military's actions in Vietnam and towards Thailand.

Havas, Washington, 2nd - U.S. authorities have recently announced that the U.S. stance on negotiations with Japan remains firm and unwavering. This stance has been detailed in Secretary of State Hull's memorandum to the Japanese representative. In reality, the negotiations have ended. Under Secretary of State Welles' meeting with the Japanese representative yesterday was motivated by a request for Japan to explain the concentration of its land, sea, and air forces in Vietnam. According to well-informed sources, although Welles stated that the U.S. memorandum was not an ultimatum, the consequences of a non-responsive reply from Japan are self-evident. Furthermore, Welles mentioned that Japan's reply could be submitted soon, indicating that the crisis would be resolved soon, and the "war of nerves" could come to an end.

Reuters, Washington, 3rd - It was learned here yesterday that Secretary of State Hull is currently suffering from a slight cold and was unable to attend President Roosevelt's meeting on the situation in the Pacific. Therefore, Under Secretary of State Welles represented him at the meeting.

Roosevelt Summons Military and Political Leaders to Review General Situation in the Far East

United Press International, Washington, 3rd - President Roosevelt met with key members of his war cabinet yesterday afternoon. According to White House Secretary O'Leary, the meeting was convened for "review" purposes, to examine the general situation in the Liaodong region. Under Secretary of State Welles also attended the meeting, apparently to report on the results of his morning negotiations with the Japanese envoy. Those attending the meeting refused to make any comments after leaving the White House at the end of the meeting. President Roosevelt later dined with former U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt. Those attending the meeting yesterday included Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Knox.

Japanese-American Talks Last Half an Hour; Tokyo's Reply Has Not Yet Been Issued

United Press International, Washington, 3rd - The Far East crisis continues to be in an uneasy state. Under Secretary of State Welles met with Japanese Ambassador Nomura and Special Envoy Kurusu for 35 minutes yesterday. Afterwards, Nomura told people, "Their meeting consisted only of Mr. Welles speaking eloquently, while we listened silently." Observers believe that Welles requested Japan to respond to the fundamental principles presented by the United States last week as soon as possible, and he also continued to inquire about the rumored movement of Japanese troops to Vietnam. A State Department spokesman said that Welles, at the direction of President Roosevelt, invited the two Japanese envoys to the State Department to consult on certain situations regarding the Japanese government. When Nomura arrived at the State Department at 10:15 a.m., he said that Hull's note to Japan was being carefully considered in Tokyo, and the reply had not yet been sent to Washington. When asked if there was still a chance of success, Kurusu replied, "Yes, I cannot easily give up this opportunity." Kurusu also told reporters that the widely circulated speech by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo was misrepresented. Tojo's speech was not as full of challenging language as reported. Kurusu said the phrase should be translated as "European countries in the East..." to deal with the actions of other countries must be eliminated. Previous reports stated that Tojo had said that Britain and the United States must be driven out of the Far East. Nomura told reporters that Japan wished to avoid war as much as possible. Nomura said, "War cannot solve anything. We can say that this is the key to war or peace, but war is of no benefit to this matter. We have no reason not to resolve this matter through diplomatic means."

Connally Responds to Japanese Prime Minister: Will Fight to Defend Our Rights

Reuters, Floiri, California, 3rd - Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said yesterday at the American Savings and Loan League convention here, "I now swear to the Japanese Prime Minister, we have all kinds of rights and are not afraid to fight for them. If Japan fights and we must fight, then they will find that we have a capable navy stationed in the Pacific. The above is my answer to the Japanese Prime Minister."

Havas, New York, 3rd - Renowned journalist Raymond Clapper published an article in the New York World-Telegram today stating that the U.S.-Japan stalemate is nearing its end. The positions of the two sides are diametrically opposed, making a compromise difficult. According to a Washington special dispatch in the New York Sun, Washington is viewing the developments in the Far East with pessimism and has publicly stated that the United States has reached its final position and cannot change it in the slightest. If Japan takes further aggressive actions, it will almost certainly trigger a war. If Japan does not accept U.S. conditions, then the current waiting stage will be difficult to prolong. If Japan has become impatient, then a break seems imminent. In addition, President Roosevelt's sudden return to Beijing from the hot springs after repeatedly consulting with naval and military authorities further proves that the U.S. naval and military forces in the Far East are ready to act.

Tokyo Promotes Japanese-Thai Joint Defense, Southward Ambitions Clearly Revealed

Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd - The "Chugai Business News" argued today for a Japanese-Thai joint defense to jointly protect Thailand, saying that if Thailand cannot maintain its neutrality alone, then Japan should force Thailand to do so at any cost, because Thailand is a part of the co-prosperity sphere. Thailand should not be limited to neutrality but should cooperate with Japan in Japan's East Asian program. Japan cannot allow British troops to enter Thailand, so it is urgently advocating a Japanese-Thai joint defense. The "Hochi Shimbun" also made similar arguments.

United Press International, Bangkok, 3rd - A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy here today, when beginning the weekly reception for the Thai press, said that the concentration of Japanese troops in southern Vietnam has another purpose and is not a threat to Thailand. The spokesman said that Japan has no intention of invading Thailand. On the contrary, Japan wants to help Thailand recover its lost territories, but if Thailand misunderstands Japan's attitude, then Japan will not provide assistance. The spokesman also said that if Britain and the United States do not accept Japan's concept of a new order, then war may break out in the Far East. Japan does not want war; the occurrence of war depends entirely on Washington. President Roosevelt talks too much, while Japan remains silent. The spokesman explained the recent anti-Thai attitude of Japanese newspapers, saying that this was due to a misunderstanding. However, the spokesman expressed dissatisfaction with the anti-Japanese attitude of some Thai newspapers. The spokesman also said that Thailand may be forced to abandon its neutrality, as Japan did in World War I. At the same time, Japanese Ambassador Tsubogami met with the Thai Prime Minister when the new counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Thailand, Ishii, arrived here from Tokyo.

Reuters, Bangkok, 3rd - It is heard that the British Embassy in Bangkok, due to the unstable international situation in the Far East, has advised Central-籍 women and men with no need to stay to consider the appropriateness of leaving Thailand at this time.

Far East War About to Break Out, U.S. Fleet Concentrating and Standing By

Reuters, Norfolk, Virginia, 3rd - The U.S. Secretary of the Navy Admeral Yesterday spoke to the Chamber of Commerce here, saying that our country's naval shipbuilding program is proceeding at the highest speed, mainly due to (1) the imminent danger of an outbreak in the Pacific, and (2) the actions taken by the country in the Great Four Years. Although our country and people are not fighting on the battlefield, they are already in the war. The powder keg of the Pacific is now waiting for a spark, which will explode throughout a quarter of the eastern part of the earth. Our navy does not underestimate Japanese power. If there is an unfortunate disturbance in the Pacific, its scale will be by no means small. Our navy is fully prepared to cope with it.

Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd - The "Yomiuri Shimbun" published an editorial on its front page today stating that the United States believes that concentrating its navy in the Pacific is enough to restrain Japan. What it does not know is that 80 percent of the U.S. fleet is anchored in the Pacific, which is tantamount to "demobilization," and Germany can therefore seize a golden opportunity to carry out full-scale activities in the Atlantic. The naval reporter of the "Yomiuri Shimbun" believes that the U.S. Navy currently concentrated in the Pacific accounts for about 80 percent of its total strength, including seven or eight battleships, three aircraft carriers, about twelve heavy cruisers, more than fifty destroyers, more than thirty submarines, and many auxiliary ships. It is now believed that these ships are all on standby in Hawaii. In addition, there are two heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, several destroyers, and several submarines and auxiliary ships anchored in Manila. Only three battleships and other teams remain anchored in the western coastal base. The naval reporter commented on the Japanese-American negotiations and firmly believes that the United States wants to maintain peace in the Pacific until 1946, and until the completion of the two-ocean fleet, Britain and the United States are now intensifying the ABCD encirclement of Japan, while paying attention to the Soviet fleet in the Far East, hoping to pull it into the ABCD camp. The question at present is whether the Soviet Union, which has a neutrality agreement with Japan, will still be manipulated by Britain and the United States. The Soviet navy in the Far East is estimated to have more than 100 ships, including one cruiser, five destroyers, about sixty submarines, two submarine supply ships, gunboats, torpedo boats, mine-laying ships, and several special service ships. Britain and the United States are particularly concerned about Soviet submarines and aircraft. Observing the situation in the Pacific, it can be seen that Japan is now under severe threat from the ABCD encirclement. The United States is intensifying this encirclement in order to realize its sinister plan. However, Japan is now calmly observing the overall situation and has deep trust in the Empire's army and navy, especially because Prime Minister Tojo and Navy Minister Shimada have recently assured in parliament that the Japanese government's full preparations have been completed.

### All Sectors in Chongqing Hold Meeting to Welcome Mr. Tan Zan, Leader of Overseas Chinese in the United States; More Than 500 People Attend; Gu Zhenggang Presides; International Radio Broadcasts Meeting

Chongqing - At 2:00 p.m. on the 2nd, the New Life Movement Service Center in Chongqing held a meeting to welcome Mr. Tan Zan, the leader of overseas Chinese in the United States. More than 500 representatives from various organizations attended. When Mr. Tan entered the meeting hall, the entire audience applauded warmly. The meeting was presided over by Gu Zhenggang, acting chairman of the National Comforting Association, who delivered a welcome speech, stating that Mr. Tan's behavior could be summarized by the four characters "Loyalty and Righteousness Worthy of Admiration." He has participated in the revolution since the Xingzhonghui and has remained loyal to the Party and the country for decades, always advancing with the times. He has also ruined his family several times for the revolution. His return to the country to attend the Political Participation Council after traveling thousands of miles is a manifestation of his loyalty to the Party and the country. Next, Mr. Tan reported on his impressions of returning to the country and the work of overseas Chinese in the United States to save the country. First, he said that he had two impressions of what he had seen and heard in Chongqing: (1) Witnessing the bombing of Chongqing increased his hatred and urged everyone to work together to complete the task of resistance and reconstruction in a short period of time. (2) Although the Japanese bombing was fierce, our compatriots remained calm as usual, without any fear, and became stronger as they were bombed, and various constructions were restored quickly. Our country is isolated and weak, and lacks armaments, but it has been able to fight Japan for more than four years, relying on four factors: (1) the supreme guiding principles left by the Founding Father, namely the Three Principles of the People; (2) the highly respected Chairman Lin and the wise leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek presiding over the central government and leading the entire battle; (3) the bloody battles of the brave soldiers; (4) the arduous struggle of the people in the rear. Therefore, the more we fight, the stronger we become, and the path to victory is clear. Although overseas Chinese are far away from the motherland, they can all understand their responsibilities, contribute their strength, contribute their money, and contribute to the country. Since the beginning of the resistance and reconstruction, they have formed various national salvation groups, raised national salvation funds, and at the same time promoted resistance and reconstruction and carried out national diplomatic work in various places. At this point, Mr. Tan also recounted the organization of overseas Chinese national salvation groups in the Americas and the methods of raising national salvation funds. Fundraising must have a tight organization and a planned approach. Since the beginning of the resistance and reconstruction, overseas Chinese in the Americas have donated a total of 20 million U.S. dollars to save the country, which was greeted with warm applause from the audience. Finally, in an impassioned tone, he warned the audience that at this critical moment of life and death for the country and the nation, we can only unite sincerely and, under the leadership of the government and the leader, move forward with determination to sacrifice. The meeting did not end until after 4:00 p.m. The situation at today's meeting has been broadcast dynamically by China's International Broadcasting Station to all parts of the world so that overseas Chinese can also listen to the enthusiastic situation at the meeting.

### British Fleet Arrives in Singapore: Far Eastern Situation Completely Changed, Civil Governance Frontline Cooperation Intensifies Encirclement, Japan's Careless Advance Will Involve Danger

Reuters, Singapore, 3rd: Reuters correspondent reports that British Prime Minister Churchill, previously en route to the United States to hold the Atlantic Conference with President Roosevelt, aboard the British 35,000-ton new battleship "Prince of Wales," yesterday led several warships of the new British Eastern Fleet to arrive here. Instantly, cheers for the British fleet's arrival spread throughout Singapore like wildfire. Regular troops, volunteers, and civilians were overjoyed upon hearing the news. The organization and distribution of the entire Eastern Fleet naturally cannot be disclosed, but responsible parties here stated that the fleet is currently being established, consisting of several heavy warships and necessary auxiliary vessels. Several of these, including the flagship, have already arrived in Singapore, and other warships will arrive soon. The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Fleet, Phillips, is currently using the "Prince of Wales" as his flagship. The arrival of this fleet not only indicates Britain's preparedness for war here but also demonstrates Britain's actual ability to prepare for war.

United Press, Singapore, 3rd: There were no extravagant or frenzied celebrations upon the British warships' arrival here, nor were there officials present to welcome them. These armored behemoths slowly sailed in, merely exchanging flag signals before mooring at the harbor as if they had always been berthed there.

Reuters, Singapore, 3rd: The Thai Consul-General here, when speaking with guests today about the British fleet's arrival in Singapore, stated that it serves as a serious warning to Japan and demonstrates Britain's attention to matters here. The Chinese Consul-General also called it a serious warning to Japan and a positive manifestation of ABCD powers' cooperation, citing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's recent remarks urging the ABCD powers to take active measures.

Havas, New York, 3rd: "The New York World-Telegram" published an editorial today commenting on the British Far East Fleet's arrival in Singapore, stating that the old American strategy of retreating from the Philippines as the starting point of a Pacific war is now outdated. The arrival of the British fleet in Singapore has transformed the entire military strategic position and political situation in the Far East. Currently, the sea and air force strength of the ABCD group of countries in the Far East has greatly increased. If Japan intends to further implement aggression, it will be doomed. However, this matter requires the four countries to maintain unity to be effective; otherwise, the entire strength of the ABCD group of countries will disintegrate and will not be a threat to Japan. The lesson learned at the cost of immense suffering in Europe need not be re-enacted in the Far East.

Reuters, New York, 3rd: The general opinion of American newspapers is that although Japan is cautious due to the setbacks of the Axis powers, it will continue its aggression plans when the opportune moment arrives. The newspapers all praised the British fleet's arrival in Singapore as evidence of British-American cooperation in the Far East and a sign of the urgency of the situation.

Reuters, Singapore, 3rd: Reuters correspondent reports that with the "Prince of Wales" battleship having arrived here, Japan will not be able to take any action in these waters, especially in the Gulf of Siam, without deploying its own warships. With the American heavy warships in Hawaii currently monitoring Japan's flank, Japan certainly dares not send its main fleet far from mainland Japan. A certain gentleman told the reporter, "This is the best excitement for those determined to defend Singapore. We all knew that without a fleet here, the battle would be very difficult, but we have never wavered in our determination and belief. Now that we have this necessary fleet, we are even more confident that we can handle everything."

### Mines Laid Off Singapore Island

Dutch East Indies Fully Prepared to Accept Challenges at Any Time

Reuters, Batavia, 3rd: Although the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly tense, the public here shows no signs of panic, and life continues as usual. However, the train station is very busy in the early morning due to soldiers going to various outposts. Observers here, referring to the recently established emergency plans for the air force, said that a general mobilization of the air force could be completed in a matter of hours if necessary. The newspapers here have prominently published Lieutenant General Ando's statement that the Dutch East Indies would not withstand a single blow from Japan. Semi-officially, it is said that we currently have no time for useless debates, and Ando may later realize that his assessment of the Dutch East Indies was too low. Generally speaking, the newspapers here believe that Japan intends to delay matters, continuing the Washington talks while waging a war of nerves. Officials claim that no matter the circumstances, the Dutch East Indies will not change its determination and will continue to maintain its composure. One newspaper stated that Tokyo's grand plan will depend on the development of the Soviet and Libyan wars. Malaya is more directly threatened by Japan, so it is currently adopting more extensive plans. However, the general mobilization of the Dutch East Indies air force will also make the world aware that the Dutch East Indies is prepared to accept challenges at any time without hesitation. Another newspaper warned the public to be constantly prepared for enemy attacks, and stated that the plans adopted by the civil governance countries in the South Pacific are extremely effective, so the enemy cannot launch a surprise attack.

Reuters, Batavia, 3rd: Dr. Mok, the newly appointed Dutch Colonial Minister, originally planned to depart for London to take office today, but has temporarily postponed his departure due to the serious situation in the Pacific. Only the newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs, Mr. Coston, is scheduled to go to London on Monday.

Reuters, Batavia, 3rd: It is reported that eighty Japanese residents, due to the tense situation, are eager to leave the Dutch East Indies. Unable to catch the regular passenger ship, they chartered six fishing boats, which set sail for Taiwan today to transfer to a regular passenger ship to return to Japan.

Complete Arrangements to Defend Australia and the Philippines

United Press, Canberra, 3rd: The Australian government yesterday continued to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation in the Pacific.

The wartime cabinet is also scheduled to move to Melbourne on Thursday to work. Reliable sources say that there are currently no steps to cancel the Christmas holidays, but this will depend on developments abroad.

Reuters, Manila, 3rd: American sailors and officers who arrived here from Shanghai yesterday said that American sailors will remain in the Philippines. A Navy spokesman told people that the sailors have landed and are preparing everything. The total number of sailors remaining in the Philippines has not been announced.

United Press, Washington, 3rd: The House Islands Committee yesterday passed the Philippines' emergency economic bill.

### Gale-Force Winds and Flying Snow: Central Route Red Army's General Counteroffensive, Major Victory Again at the Frontline of Tula, Remnants of the Southern Route German Army Flee Westward in Disarray

TASS, 3rd: A special correspondent for the "Izvestia" reports that on December 1st, true winter arrived. Snow fell at night, and the temperature dropped sharply in the morning, accompanied by a sudden gale and flying snow. Under these favorable conditions, the Red Army south of Moscow continued to advance on the enemy, who retreated in panic, attempting to desperately defend the highway south of K Town. Our army, under the cover of tanks, counterattacked and recaptured the village of Belyanovo. At night, the Germans counterattacked with tanks, but our army won another victory in response. In short, at various points in the southern Moscow area, the enemy was forced to retreat twenty to fifty kilometers from K Town, abandoning much military equipment along the way.

United Press, Kuibyshev, 3rd: The Soviet mechanized units' battles in the past two days have been one of the most powerful counteroffensives since the start of the war, repelling the German army that was fiercely attacking the Soviet capital from the south. The German army, attacked by fierce Soviet tanks, has been forced to retreat fifty kilometers in one place and twenty kilometers in another. A Soviet spokesman recently stated that the German army in these areas has completely collapsed. The Soviet army, launching a strong offensive from Moscow, has driven back the German army at point M. These German troops are now being gradually annihilated. Recent military news seems to indicate that the Red Army in this area has taken the Germans by surprise with lightning speed, as the Soviet army had secretly gathered a large number of ambushes in and around the Moscow area. After the Soviet army drove back the German army with infantry and tanks, it fiercely pursued the fleeing enemy. In this campaign, the Soviet army also captured the village of Balabanovo through a joint offensive of cavalry and tanks. According to military news arriving here today, when the Soviet army launched a fierce counteroffensive northwest of Tula, three more German divisions were defeated. The Soviet offensive in the area of Nara is still in progress.

TASS, Moscow, 3rd: A special correspondent for "Pravda" reports that on December 1st, the enemy army on the central route was most active in Klin and Volokolamsk. The enemy attacked twice with three divisions, attempting to encircle our front line from the northeast and northwest, but was repelled. On December 2nd, the enemy attacked again, occupying a village at a heavy loss, but at night, our infantry, under the cover of British-made tanks, stormed into the village and re-evaluated it after street fighting. The enemy suffered 300 deaths, and 36 artillery positions and 40 military vehicles were destroyed by us. In the areas of Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets, there were only artillery battles and sentinel contact. In the area of Stalinogorsk, our army counterattacked and continued to pursue the enemy in victory. Our air force destroyed four German planes, fifty tanks, one hundred and fifteen military vehicles, and three anti-aircraft guns in one day, and annihilated a battalion of enemy infantry. In total, the enemy's attack on Moscow for the past fifteen days has not brought about any major changes. The enemy concentrated a large army in the areas of Klin and Volokolamsk, attempting to implement their pincer strategy and break into our positions. At some points, the enemy continued to advance, so the situation in this area remains the most serious.

Reuters, London, 3rd: Official Soviet sources state that the Red Army on the Moscow front has dealt the German army an even heavier new blow. General Timoshenko's troops in the southern area are currently advancing west from Rostov and encircling the remnants of the German mechanized and infantry divisions retreating towards Mariupol. In many areas of the southern front, the Soviet army has taken the initiative.

TASS, Southern Front, 3rd: A "Pravda" military correspondent reports that our army is continuing to advance on the southern route, and the enemy is still retreating, abandoning countless war implements along the way. According to preliminary statistics, the German fascists suffered 21,000 deaths and injuries in the Battle of Rostov.

Northern Route German Army Switches from Offense to Defense, Suffers Heavy Losses in Five Days of Fighting

TASS, Moscow, 3rd: A special correspondent for "Izvestia" reports from Leningrad on the northern route that our army continues to clear out the enemy on the southern bank of the N River, recapturing many key points. Under the cover of tanks, our army began the battle for the T River crossing. Also, our artillery on the northern route has achieved great merit. In a short period, a certain artillery unit destroyed eighteen long-range cannons and annihilated four motorized detachments of the enemy.

Reuters, Moscow, 3rd: Soviet war news reports that several German divisions near Lake Ilmen in the northwestern area of the front line have been severely defeated and are now taking a defensive posture, digging trenches to defend. Over the past five days, Soviet troops in multiple areas of the northwestern front have broken through the enemy's vanguard line and attacked the enemy. Soviet troops defeated two battalions of the 96th Regiment of the 32nd German Infantry Division and annihilated two companies of infantry from the 1st German Assault Regiment. During the same period, Soviet troops northeast of Novgorod annihilated a battalion of enemy infantry and destroyed four enemy tanks. Elsewhere, Soviet troops also annihilated approximately 2,500 German officers and soldiers and destroyed 27 enemy artillery positions. The German offensive in all areas of the front line has been severely damaged and retreated.

British-Made Tanks Appear on the Battlefield, Charge and Conquer Everywhere

United Press, Moscow, 3rd: According to frontline reports, a large force of British tanks attacked German positions in the city of Volokolamsk yesterday. Although the German army fired countless direct-fire guns at the British tanks, and bullets rained down like hail, these British mechanized monsters remained unmoved and continued to advance straight to the center of the city. Soviet infantry also followed and advanced, and the German army was forced to withdraw from the city, abandoning a large amount of supplies. The military news also stated that the Soviet military believes this victory is very important, as it is reported that the German army has lost the huge amount of gasoline it had seized in the city in this battle. Before fleeing, the German army attempted to set fire to these gasoline stores, but the attempt failed. A Soviet military spokesman stated that after the British tanks entered the city, more than 300 remaining German soldiers who failed to escape were killed. The spokesman expressed deep satisfaction with the excellent quality of the British tanks.

German Army Destroys and Massacres Everywhere, Rostov Completely Changed

Reuters, Moscow, 3rd: A "Pravda" report today detailed the situation in the Rostov area after the Soviet army drove out the German army. It is said that the entire area from Aksai to Rostov to Taganrog is like a large road, full of corpses. Soviet troops are now advancing steadily. Although Rostov was only under German control for a few days, it has been completely changed. Many houses have been reduced to ruins, and shops and residences have been looted. We cannot help but feel increasingly indignant as we walk along the deserted, glass-strewn streets. Two corpses hang in one house, each with a piece of paper attached to the chest that reads "This is how we Germans deal with guerrillas." There are dozens of corpses inside No. 53 Angel Street, because a German officer in this area was killed by an unknown person, and the German army then shot Professor Rozhdasvensky's family to show revenge. The German army attempted to rule Rostov with blood, but the city will never yield, but will repay blood debts with blood. The corpses of German officers and soldiers killed at night were thrown into the frozen Don River. Several women also strangled three drunken German soldiers. The residents of Rostov have no fear in their hearts, only resentment. On the morning after the recapture of Rostov, they began to work separately. Railway workers repaired bridges on the Don River, women rushed to the bakery, workers were busy repairing streetcar lines, and soldiers were urgently building new power lines. White-gloved civilian groups are now seen at intersections again. The city of Rostov has now returned to normal life, and is carrying out the work of cleaning up the devastation, restoring factory water and electricity supply, and facilitating transportation.

### Britain Issues Final Warning to Finland, Declaration of War Seems Inevitable

United Press, Stockholm, 3rd: News obtained from Helsinki yesterday indicates that Britain has issued a final warning to Finland regarding Finland's continued participation in the war against the Soviet Union, and that this warning will expire on Friday.

TASS, London, 3rd: A diplomatic observer for "The Times" reports that according to reports from Helsinki and Washington, Britain is on the eve of declaring war on Finland. On November 29, the Finnish Prime Minister convened a cabinet meeting and announced that Britain has decided to declare war on Finland. Since Finland cannot stop invading the Soviet Union, the British government has no choice but to declare a state of war with Finland, Hungary, and Romania.

### Franco-German Cooperation Accelerates Negotiations

United Press, Vichy, 3rd: The French and German governments today studied detailed reports of the meeting between Pétain and Göring. At the same time, French political commentators here said that this meeting is as important as the meeting between Pétain and Hitler in Montoire last year, because this meeting is to enlighten the future of Franco-German cooperation. Authoritative sources claim that the meeting between German Ambassador Abetz and French Ambassador Brinon in Paris today is also an indication that France and Germany are accelerating negotiations.

### Japan's Central Cooperative Council Scheduled to Meet, Tojo Will Explain Policies

Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd: According to Japanese sources, the Central Cooperative Committee of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association is scheduled to hold its second meeting in Tokyo on December 8, lasting five days. At that time, Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Togo, Minister of Finance Kaya, and other cabinet members will all attend to explain the government's policies for dealing with the tense international situation. The meeting will consider the following major national issues: (1) Improving public morale, (2) Stabilizing the national mobilization program, (3) Establishing a cooperative political system, (4) Consolidating the nation's vitality, (5) Stabilizing wartime food supply, (6) Utilizing Japan's economic strength.

### Japan's Economy on the Brink of Collapse, Inevitable Defeat if it Participates in the War

United Press, New York, 3rd: "The Wall Street Journal" published an analysis yesterday on the front page, concluding that "Economically, Japan is living on borrowed time." The report stated, "There is a country in the world today that is standing on the edge of war, and the outcome of the war, 99 percent certain, is enough to make its empire collapse. That country is Japan." The article pointed out that 80 percent of Japan's raw materials are supplied by Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies.

Editorial

### British Fleet Sails to the Far East

Last month, the United States passed an amendment to the Neutrality Act on the 13th, which is a major event in recent international affairs. The spirit of the Neutrality Act had long been dead in name only, but it always stood in the way, preventing the United States from taking a further step to share the sacred task of anti-aggression with the Allied democratic countries. The passage of the bill, on the negative side, broke through the previous American fear of being affected by the war, and on the positive side, American merchant ships carrying war materials gained the freedom to enter and exit the war zone and could directly resist the Axis powers with arms. More importantly, the United States will share part of the responsibility for the Atlantic convoy mission, reducing the burden on the British fleet, thus making it possible for the British fleet to transfer part of its forces from the Atlantic to reinforce the Mediterranean and the Far East. Therefore, at the same time that the United States amended the Neutrality Act, British Prime Minister Churchill expressed that Britain would greatly enhance its naval strength in the Far East. It is generally speculated that the British fleet, including powerful warships, is expected to appear in the Pacific and Indian Oceans soon. Sure enough, less than two weeks later, just as the situation in the Far East reached its final juncture, the British Far East Fleet, with the new 35,000-ton battleship Prince of Wales as its flagship, had arrived in the Far East the day before yesterday to reinforce the fortress of Singapore.

The current Pacific problem is being negotiated solely by the United States and Japan, with Britain standing in a position of advancing and retreating with the United States. However, looking at the recent movements of the British side, it is clear that they are more active and eager than Washington. For example, the US authorities have not yet revealed how to deal with a possible war in the Far East, while Churchill has clearly declared that Britain will declare war on the US within an hour. The US is only engaged in passive preparations for evacuating expatriates and troops, while Britain's territories in the Far East, from Burma to the Malay Peninsula to Australia, have entered a wartime state. This is naturally because British territory bears the brunt, and if war unfortunately breaks out, it will inevitably erupt first between Britain and Japan. Moreover, for strategic reasons, at least in the initial stages of the war, Britain will bear a greater responsibility. Now, the main force of the US Pacific Fleet is far away in Pearl Harbor, 3,000 nautical miles away. There is no naval base that can be used between there and the west coast of the Pacific. In the one or two weeks before the US fleet can come to help, the defense of the western Pacific cannot but rely solely on the British maritime power. Therefore, at this moment, it is natural for the British to send a powerful fleet into the solid and perfect fortress of Singapore, which only lacks warships.

No matter how deliberately the Japanese side expresses its contempt, the strength of the ABCD line, without exaggeration, is at least powerful and invincible in the Far East. On land, China alone is enough to form a balance with Japan. In the air, the sum of the British and American Far East air forces has proved to exceed Japan in both quality and quantity. At sea, comparing only the United States and Japan, the ratio of their existing total strength is said by the Japanese themselves to be 100 to 81 (?). Although the United States cannot but take into account the security of the Atlantic, it always maintains the superiority of the Pacific Fleet over the entire Japanese fleet. Therefore, in terms of actual strength, Japan has absolutely no chance to be侥幸, but in terms of geographical factors, it has a slight innate advantage. This is undoubtedly the most noteworthy issue for the future Far East War, which will be dominated by a naval decisive battle. Although the US Pacific Fleet has enormous strength and the endurance to facilitate long-range operations, the current focus of the crisis is in the South China Sea and near the Indochina Peninsula. The main force of the US fleet, thousands of miles away, is obviously beyond reach. Even if it rushes to help, it must make foolproof strategic plans in order to avoid repeating the mistakes of the Russian Baltic Fleet in the Battle of Tsushima in the Russo-Japanese War. However, if the ABCD line can put up a strong resistance in the Malay Peninsula, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, etc., and if there is a strong navy in the South China Sea that can respond to changes, then the situation of the war will be completely different. At that time, the Japanese army will encounter strong resistance in the above-mentioned areas, and under the opportunity for the US fleet to open westward, Japan will be in an awkward situation of being attacked from both sides. Recently, Britain's active reinforcement of various places in Southeast Asia is indeed a wise precaution, and the large-scale eastward movement of a strong fleet to strengthen the maritime strength of the democratic front in the South Pacific is enough to change the situation of offense and defense in the Far East.

The Prince of Wales and the George V are the latest type of battleships in the UK. They participated in the battle against the German battleship Bismarck in the Strait of Denmark this summer. Now they have come to Singapore to reinforce the defense, which shows the importance the British authorities attach to the crisis in the Far East. Compared with the Japanese latest battleships Nagato and Mutsu, the British ships are far superior in terms of tonnage, speed, armor, and defense. However, they are equipped with only ten 14-inch guns, unlike the Japanese ships, which are equipped with eight 16-inch guns. However, according to experts, the penetration and superiority of this type of 14-inch gun is no less than that of ships equipped with eight or nine 16-inch guns. However, Japan has been secretly building ships for many years, and it is said that its latest type of main battle ships, Nisshin and Takamatsu, have been launched, but their performance is still unknown. Moreover, Japan has been short of materials and steel for many years, and its shipbuilding program cannot compete with any of the UK and the US. It is still unknown how many ships, besides the Prince of Wales, have come at the same time. According to naval practice, each heavy battleship must be assisted by several cruisers and destroyers. Even if the main force of the British fleet in this eastward movement is only this one ship, there must be several auxiliary ships coming together to form a strong combat unit. The remnants of the German and Italian navies are now insignificant, and the Atlantic convoy only requires destroyers and light cruisers, and the United States is sharing the burden. If the situation in the Far East changes, it is believed that the UK will be able to send more naval main forces eastward to reinforce the defense.

Although the US-Japan negotiations are in a dangerous situation, they are not completely hopeless. If the Japanese side is not prepared to take excessive risks, it should understand the warning significance of the British side's contingency preparations and quickly make plans to rein in at the edge of the cliff. For the sake of preparedness, the US fleet in Pearl Harbor should also take parallel measures with the UK. Then, no matter what the future situation is, the democratic front has a solid and indestructible favorable position in the West Pacific strategically, and it is also more conducive to promoting the awakening of the Japanese side.

### Libyan Front: British and German Forces in Mixed Battle; British Corridor Southeast of Tobruk Breached

Reuters, London, 3rd - According to a recent public statement, enemy forces east of Tobruk in North Africa have made contact with enemy forces six miles north of El Gazala. Responsible officials here explain that the British corridor outside Tobruk has been temporarily breached. It is estimated that British forces are now fighting to restore this corridor. Contact between Tobruk and British ground forces may have been temporarily cut off again, but not as completely as before, as the situation southeast of Tobruk is constantly changing. The main force of the attacking enemy seems to be the 15th Panzer Division, which launched an attack from the southwest. Those who have joined forces with them may be the remnants of the German 21st Division. The battle is continuing, and the situation is chaotic. The German forces now appear to be able to attempt to break through and escape to the west.

Many Axis Supply Ships Sunk

Reuters, London, 3rd

Enemy ships transporting military supplies across the central Mediterranean to support enemy forces in Libya were intercepted by allied ships and suffered heavy losses. Yesterday morning, British ships intercepted the Italian supply ship "Adriana" (2,76 tons), which was loaded with ammunition and vehicles, and sank it with gunfire. Some of the enemy crew were rescued. Subsequently, British ships intercepted the enemy oil tanker "Mantovani" (6,500 tons) and the escorting enemy destroyer "Mostai" (1,628 tons). The enemy ship was hit and exploded, and the "Mantovani", carrying approximately 10,000 tons of gasoline, was also hit and sunk. The British ships suffered no damage, and the crew suffered no casualties.

Italian Forces in Gondar Have Completely Surrendered

Reuters, Nairobi, 3rd - According to a report published here yesterday, enemy troops stationed around Gondar in East Africa have now completely surrendered. It is reported that approximately 11,500 Italian soldiers and 11,000 native soldiers were captured in Gondar. British casualties were light. The evacuation of prisoners began on November 30 and is still ongoing. Italian General Nasam and several other senior officers were among the first to be evacuated. The exact number of captured artillery, ammunition, transport, and military supplies is not yet known, but it is known to be very large, including 50 cannons. The enemy troops stationed around the area have now completely surrendered, and Gondar has adopted a new British military administrative system.

### HMAS Sydney: Glorious Achievements; Australians Proud

Reuters, Sydney, 3rd - Apart from the Australian destroyer "Waterhen," which was sunk in the Mediterranean in early July this year, the loss of the cruiser "Sydney" is the first major loss in Australian naval warfare in two years. The "Sydney" achieved remarkable military exploits in the Mediterranean and continued the glorious history of the previous "Sydney," which sank the famous German ship "Emden" in 1914. The public is saddened by the unfortunate news of the ship's loss. Yesterday, they gathered at the Cathedral here to hold a solemn memorial service. Newspapers here said that the ship could no longer fight, but its spirit remained, and it was as glorious as the ships "Cossack" and "Ajax." The Australian government gazette also said that the loss of the ship was indeed regrettable, but the ship maintained the glory of the Australian Navy and completed brilliant combat achievements, which the Australian people should be proud of.

Reuters, Melbourne, 3rd - Survivors of the German raider "Kormoran," which was sunk by the lost Australian cruiser "Sydney," have arrived at a port in western Australia in two boats. It is claimed that the "Kormoran" engaged in battle with the "Sydney" on November 19, and the first shell hit the bridge. Although the "Sydney" was sinking, it continued to fire, causing the German ship to be hit and catch fire. A total of 286 crew members of the "Kormoran" were rescued, about ten of whom were injured by shrapnel.

### Britain Gathers Manpower to Cope with Crisis; Prime Minister Proposes in Parliament to Recruit Women for Military Service

Reuters, London, 3rd - British Prime Minister Churchill said last night in the House of Commons that when proposing to recruit women and gather manpower to seek the highest national effort, invasions and air raids would often come until the end of the war. Invasions may never materialize, but we must have well-trained mobile troops constantly in preparation to prevent them from happening. As for the danger of air raids, Hitler will at any time acknowledge his defeat by the Soviet army and try to vent his anger on us. We should deal with it with a larger army and various new types of equipment. The government will ask Parliament to grant it the power to recruit unmarried women between the ages of 20 and 30, approximately 1,620,000 people, into military service, and the age for men to begin military service will also be reduced to 18, so that 70,000 more people can be obtained in 1942. All men and women between the ages of 16 and 18 will be registered and join the National Volunteer Organization. Women between the ages of 20 and 30 can choose one of two jobs: either in the civil defense auxiliary team or in industries that need mobile workers.

### Revolutionary Plot Uncovered in Italy; Sixty People Sentenced to Death

International News Service, Rome, 3rd - A major plot to assassinate Mussolini and overthrow the fascist government was discovered in Trieste today. Sixty people have been sentenced to death. It is understood that this plot is not only limited to assassinating the Italian Prime Minister and overthrowing the Italian government, but also aims to sabotage Italian wartime industries and transportation. It is reported that these sixty defendants "are all members of the People's Freedom Party and the Communist Party," and it is also said that they are related to the three recent major explosions in ammunition factories. It is said that 127 people were killed and more than 1,000 injured in the three explosions. The Stefani News Agency declared that this large-scale conspiracy originally intended to encourage a national revolution and to separate the two countries of Italy and Germany. The German side claimed that the conspiracy originated twenty years ago, but the conspirators' first activity, an attempt to assassinate Mussolini, was only before the Third War. The scope of their activities was to blow up ammunition factories and railways. Only eleven of the ringleaders of the conspirators have been arrested so far. The Italian government will not announce the names of those who have been arrested and those who are still being pursued.

### British Troops Land in Equatorial Africa

United Press, Rome, 3rd - "Messaggero" today carried a Vichy message stating that the place where British troops landed on the coast of Equatorial Africa is within striking distance of French colonies. Rear Admiral Platon is currently inspecting the area to reorganize French local defenses.

### Vichy Government Speaks for Japan

Havas, Vichy, 3rd - Regarding US President Roosevelt's statement that the number of Japanese troops in Vietnam has exceeded the number stipulated in the Franco-Japanese agreement, well-informed sources here recently commented that the number of Japanese troops in Vietnam has not exceeded the scope of the agreement. The French government has always insisted on this.

### War in Europe: Germany Two Years After the War

Just as it was difficult to resolve, the mother came and stopped them, telling one child to turn the bicycle upright and let his sister sit on it. That girl, however, said, "Don't move. Leave it like this. Now it's my turn to be a pilot."

In German parks, a small number of benches are placed in the worst corners of the scenery, marked with the words "For Jews Only," and they are often very crowded. The people sitting there try to squeeze together as much as possible to make room for more people. Their faces are all dull and expressionless. At that time, an order was just issued that if a bombed family needed housing, or a married party soldier could not find a suitable apartment, the Jews should immediately give up their apartment. The Jews who were ordered to move out knew that they had to leave all the furniture for the new owners to use.

When the weather is warm, there is more fresh food in the open-air vegetable markets. On the vegetable stalls under the dilapidated tents, lettuce and radishes are displayed until 11:30 in the afternoon before they are closed. Except for poultry, fruits, and a few vegetables, the food allowed on the ration cards can usually be purchased. However, a small number of seasonal summer items can only be purchased by housewives who have a special relationship with the store. These items, such as seagull eggs, fresh asparagus, spinach, and potatoes, are sold under the counter. News about the famine in Belgium, the high prices and lack of supplies in France, the war-torn capital of Yugoslavia, transportation difficulties, food shortages for residents, and the fact that famous hotels in Athens only have one or two dishes per meal at exorbitant prices has been leaked to Germany. Therefore, when the weekly meat ration for each person in Germany was reduced from 500 grams to 400 grams from June 2, it did not cause any dissatisfaction among the people. They mostly know that what they are eating this summer is already much better than what people in other parts of Europe are eating.

Some girls wear short socks, and some even go barefoot. The snow-white legs of the young women have all been tanned black. The fashionable women in Berlin wear new-style coats, beautiful hats, and neat gloves, but from the knees down they are completely naked. There are also those who use eyebrow pencils to draw a fake seam on the back of their calves to pretend to be wearing long stockings. They can say like the poet, "Hard work, happy holidays." But he did not mention where he had seen happy holidays in Germany.

Although there is much deep dissatisfaction within Germany, the forces are divided and weak and cannot unite for effective resistance. Catholics hate communists, Prussian imperialists support the Hohenzollern royal family, and Bavarian monarchists support the Wittelsbach royal family. These two factions are also incompatible with radicals and democrats. Democrats also believe that their future is hopeless.

Although Germans want peace, they want a peace that can be won now, not a defeated peace. They still remember how the peace after the last European war taught them a lesson, and they know that the situation after this defeat will be even worse than before. They know that, apart from the British peace terms, the people of all the defeated countries on the European continent are waiting for revenge.

The first hope of most Germans is that Germany will not be defeated, and overthrowing the current regime is secondary. If Germans think further, they will inevitably ask, "What will we replace the current government with? If we win under the current government, we cannot overthrow it. If we overthrow the current government, we cannot win."

Germans like to think on the more optimistic side. But what about the situation in the war against Russia? Will the United States declare war on Germany? When can we get peace? Will we be defeated? Don't think about these things at all. Just work, wait in line, sleep, and live on.

What made the Germans first feel the reality of the war was probably the war against Russia. Germany's previous victories were all overwhelming and involved little bloodshed. When the German army attacked Crete, I happened to be in a village, and news came that two local teenagers had been killed in action. (To be continued)

### All British Merchant Ships in Coastal Ports Suspend Navigation; Receive Emergency Orders to Evacuate; Ships in North China Sail Directly to Hong Kong; Evacuation Ship Anhui Sailed from Shanghai Yesterday with More Than 400 Women and Children

The situation in the Far East has not eased in recent days. British and American evacuations are busy. British and American ships sailing to the Far East have now all suspended navigation. British and American expatriates in the occupied areas are now being evacuated one after another. The Taikoo Company's Anhui was designated by the British Embassy as a special ship for evacuation. Yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 p.m., it sailed from the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession, carrying more than 400 British expatriate women and children southward. Among them, there were about 50 Indian expatriates who were evacuated from the occupied areas of the Yangtze River and North China. In addition, 70 British expatriates were evacuated from Tianjin and arrived in Shanghai on the 1st of this month. They transferred to the Anhui and left Shanghai. Most of them went to Hong Kong to transfer to ships to Australia, and some of them took the original ship to Calcutta, India. There was also a small number of British expatriates who were enlisting for military service in Singapore. According to some of the evacuated British expatriate women and children, they will soon be able to return to Shanghai. Another part said that they would go to Australia to live permanently and would not return to Shanghai.

British Ships in Shanghai Have Been Requisitioned

There are still 8,000 British and Indian expatriates in this city. If necessary in the future, how these expatriates will be evacuated is now being planned. The British expatriates carried by the Anhui were the second evacuation since the Sino-Japanese War four years ago. Recently, British ships in Shanghai have been requisitioned. The Taikoo Company's Anhui, Nanning, and Beihai left Shanghai yesterday. The Beihai arrived in port at about 3:00 p.m. the day before yesterday (2nd). It was originally scheduled to carry cargo south to Hong Kong, Singapore, and then to Yangon this Sunday. It received an emergency order the night before last to completely unload the cargo before 2:00 p.m. yesterday, and then at 3:00 p.m., it set sail with more than a dozen British employees of the Taikoo Company.

Three Ships Turned Back Temporarily

It is reported that the Taikoo Company's Guizhou and Guiyang, and the Jardine Matheson's Fu Sheng arrived at the Wusongkou yesterday morning. Because they received a telegram ordering them to return to Hong Kong, the three ships anchored outside the port and did not enter the Songkou. After the Nanning, Anhui, and Beihai left port, the six ships will sail to Hong Kong together. The Taikoo Company's Ganzhou and New Beijing in North China will also not come to Shanghai. The Ganzhou sailed directly from Qingdao to Hong Kong the day before yesterday (2nd), and the New Beijing also sailed directly from Yantai to Hong Kong the day before yesterday. The Jardine Matheson's Risheng, which left Shanghai for Tianjin the day before yesterday, may also have difficulty reaching its destination, or it may sail south halfway.

Three Small Ships Moved to Puxi

The Taikoo Company also has three shallow-water ships, the Suiding, Jintang, and Wantong, which operate on the Sichuan River, and about 20 iron cargo barges, all of which are berthed at the Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong. The three shallow-water ships were suddenly towed to the company's wharf in the French Concession by small ships yesterday afternoon. The Wantong stopped at Pier No. 2, and the Suiding and Jintang were docked together at Pier No. 1. It is said that after being repaired urgently, they will also leave Shanghai for Singapore immediately. The iron cargo barges are still berthed in Pudong and will have to be towed to the Puxi Wharf when necessary. As of now, British and American ships along the Chinese coast have completely evacuated and sailed to Hong Kong or Singapore.

Japanese Ships Have Also Been Requisitioned for Military Use

The Japanese merchant ships, except for the Shanghai Maru and Nagasaki Maru, which operate on the Sino-Japanese liaison route, are all being requisitioned for military use. Only French ships are maintaining the Nanyang route. The French Company's Kai Ting sailed from Shanghai to Haiphong yesterday morning. The post ship General Joffre is scheduled to depart at 8:00 a.m. today, returning to Saigon via Little Luzon. There are more than 100 passengers, including about 30 American bridges, who are wealthy merchants in this city. They will take the post ship to Little Luzon and transfer to ships to return to the United States. After General Joffre leaves Shanghai this morning, there is still the D'Artagnan post ship remaining in Shanghai, which will return to Saigon and Little Luzon next Wednesday (10th). According to the French Company yesterday, it has received secret orders that ship schedules will also be kept secret in the future. According to authoritative sources in the shipping industry, although the current situation is serious, British and American merchant ships have completely left Shanghai and will no longer sail here, but if the situation improves, they can resume navigation at any time.

### Flour Stored in This City is Not Allowed to Be Moved or Exported; Purchase of Stored Flour is Being Studied for Pricing; Unregistered Stored Flour is Equivalent to Being "Frozen"

According to the Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Bureau held a special meeting at 3:30 p.m. yesterday (3rd), and it was resolved that any attempt to move flour for export would be prohibited. At the same time, the Bureau is preparing to purchase flour intended for export. This measure is necessary in order to maintain reserves to meet the needs of this port and is waiting for the foreign flour that has already been ordered to be shipped to Shanghai.

Registration

The registration of stored flour organized by the Bureau has just been completed. Although the amount of stored flour registered is much larger than estimated, in view of transportation difficulties and the uncertain situation in the Pacific, the Bureau believes that it is unwise to allow flour to be exported, resulting in a reduction in reserves.

Purchase

Regarding the Bureau's purchase of stored flour, the Price Control Committee will study it in order to determine a price that can give importers a reasonable and fair profit. The Bureau reports that there is currently a large amount of stored flour that has not been registered with the Bureau in accordance with regulations. If the Bureau decides to purchase stored flour, it will not give the same profit to unregistered flour. Those who have not yet registered with the Bureau should do so as soon as possible for their own and the public's benefit. Do not wait and see. Currently unregistered stored flour is equivalent to being "frozen," because the Bureau does not intend to issue transportation permits.

### A Batch of Bureau Rice Released from Warehouses - Sold Yesterday - Another 27,000 Bags Arrived Yesterday

The Rice Dealers Association, again dispatched representatives the day before yesterday to obtain 294 permits for transporting rice from the Rice Management Committee. Dealers with card numbers 91 to 294 were authorized to pay and pick up goods yesterday, resuming the sale of foreign rice in stores. Starting today, the registration for the sale of foreign rice stored in warehouses will continue, limited to rice dealers lacking rice within the International Settlement. Furthermore, the Panama merchant ship "Mariposa," arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday morning. The ship carries 27,000 bags of rice purchased by the Public Works Department, all of which will be unloaded in Shanghai.

### Three Major Fire Cases - Strict Investigation and Handling

The defendant, Bao Gongxiang (transliteration), is the manager of the Fagud (transliteration) Transportation Company at 423 Sichuan Road. The company's warehouse suddenly caught fire on the afternoon of October 28, resulting in significant losses and the death of a Chinese firefighter in the Public Concession. It is now known that the case will be retried in the Special First Court the day after tomorrow. Furthermore, the goods stored in the warehouse are estimated to be worth approximately 4.5 million yuan, with losses exceeding 2.65 million yuan, not including the burned buildings. Last Saturday afternoon, a fire broke out at No. 646 Jing'an Temple Road due to the storage of flammable liquids, resulting in four deaths and seven injuries. The culprit is being searched for by the police. It is understood that storing flammable materials is illegal, and the culprit's escape from justice is even more despicable. Regarding the fire on Zhu Bao San Road, the responsible authorities stated that an investigation is underway, and the losses are still difficult to estimate.

### Drills on Various Islands in Manila - Coastal Artillery Firing - Designated Dangerous Areas - Shanghai Customs Has Received Notification

According to a notice from the Philippine U.S. Naval Authorities to the Jianghai Customs, submarine and mine drills will continue to be conducted in Manila Harbor and on islands with fortifications throughout December. From December 1st to the 23rd, excluding Sundays, coastal artillery, anti-aircraft artillery, and machine gun firing drills will be conducted on the islands daily. The area within 15 kilometers of the islands' coasts is designated as a dangerous zone. All ships entering and exiting must strictly adhere to navigation rules. After receiving the report, the customs office has posted notices strictly instructing all vessels to pay attention.

### German Diplomatic Personnel - Will Come to Shanghai from Tianjin

It is recently learned that Weitmann (former German Consul-General in San Francisco), who arrived in Dagu a few days ago to take office as the German Consul-General there, is expected to come to Shanghai this week.

### Public Works Department Discusses Patrol Lines in Police District E with Japanese Side - Police Officers Only Patrol Roads Outside the Boundary - But the Police Department's Authority is Defined

Representatives from the Public Works Department and the Police Department and the Japanese authorities have begun discussions to formulate the final detailed measures for the establishment of "Police District E", which is expected to be completed soon. The Public Works Department and the Japanese side have long agreed on the basic points for establishing this new police district.

Establish a Separate Police Force Managed by the Japanese

The establishment of Police District "E" involves the establishment of a separate police force managed by the Japanese, covering the area north of the Suzhou Creek. The Public Works Department has announced that it will send 300 additional police officers to serve north of the Suzhou Creek. According to disclosures from key police officials, this batch of police officers will be dispatched when Police District "E" is established. According to the plan for setting up Police District "E," it was first proposed two years ago when Fackling was the Chairman of the Public Works Department. The final discussion on setting up this new police district only began when the Japanese Bo Masaru was recently appointed as the Special Deputy Commissioner of the Police Department.

Divide Authority with Reference to Maps

The spokesman of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai stated when he hosted a press conference in April last year that the police officers in District "E" would only patrol the roads outside the boundary: North Sichuan Road, Dixiwei Road, Jiangwan Road, and Scott Road. The Police Department will have jurisdiction, but the Police Department's authority will not extend to the area between North Sichuan Road and Dixiwei Road. The small hill between Oujia Road and Dixiwei Road is also not under the Police Department's jurisdiction. These boundaries were agreed upon after careful study of maps mutually agreed upon by the Public Works Department and the Japanese side.

### No Storing of Goods Allowed in Residences

The Fire Department of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the Fire Brigade of the French Concession Authority, considering that fires have been constantly occurring in the concessions recently, with the causes of the fires mostly due to residents storing flammable materials, coupled with the dry weather, making it difficult to extinguish fires once they occur, endangering the lives and property of citizens and affecting the order and tranquility, have decided to take investigation and supervision measures to eliminate the occurrence of unexpected incidents. Residences are not allowed in places where goods are stored and windows are inconvenient, and large quantities of goods are not allowed to be stored in residences. Flammable materials must absolutely not be stored. Violators will be punished according to violation regulations. Furthermore, car garages along the road are not allowed to be converted into bedrooms in order to maintain public order and tranquility. At the same time, the police authorities are requested to assist in handling the matter.

### Future Gasoline Supply - Depends on the Situation - If Shipping Remains Smooth, No Further Reductions May Be Necessary

Personnel from Shanghai's three major gasoline companies have recently appealed to the public to use gasoline more sparingly to help the city through the current "temporary gasoline shortage." It is said that the announcement of the 50% reduction in gasoline allocation

is a matter of necessity.

Although it cannot be said that there is no gasoline currently en route to Shanghai, no one knows exactly when it will arrive in the port. It is rumored that the withdrawal of British ships from Shanghai is also one of the main reasons for the 50% reduction in gasoline allocation, but oil company personnel are tight-lipped about it. According to a key official, if no oil arrives in the near future, gasoline companies may be forced to stop selling gasoline to the public. However,

it is too early

to talk about this now. Everything depends on political events within the next two weeks. If the war crisis currently threatening Shanghai is resolved, the gasoline supply problem will become clearer. Furthermore, according to an employee of an American oil company, the company is currently awaiting a telegram from the U.S. head office regarding future gasoline supplies, and the head office is obviously waiting for the political situation in the Far East to become clear before continuing to ship gasoline. The current gasoline reserves in Shanghai are a matter of speculation, with some saying that there is no large-scale hoarding.

### Woman Instigates Crowd to Strangle Husband's Brother

Wang Xiling (42 years old), from Jiancheng, Jiangbei, worked as a horse carriage laborer. Due to the consumption of white flour, his income was insufficient, and he often borrowed money from his younger brother Wang Ximing at No. 3400 South Yinghua Lane, Hed Road, or took the opportunity to steal clothes for pawn. His sister-in-law Wang Shi hated him to the bone. At 5:30 PM on the 2nd of this month, he went to his brother's house again to forcibly borrow money. As the brother was not at home, he argued with his sister-in-law Shi. Shi cried out to her brother Shi Changgen, who came and scolded him. Shi and her brother dragged him to the third floor and used a hemp rope to tie it around his head, pulling it close to the door frame and strangling him to death. Afterwards, they invited neighbors Wang Guozhen from Tianjin and a woman, Shi Chen, to move the body to an abandoned area outside the back door. Later, Western Police Officer No. 259 from the Putuo Road Police Station passed by and discovered it. He alerted the police station, which dispatched an ambulance to rush to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was already too late. The body was sent to the Jiaozhou Road morgue. Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to arrest Shi Changgen, Wang Shi, Wang Guozhen, and his brother Wang Ximing (for agreeing to move the body) and take them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division 3 of the Special First Court. Police station lawyer Li Zhishan filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law for murder, requesting a postponement. Judge Huang Risheng questioned the defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody pending further examination of the body.

### Rent Increase Dispute at YMCA Dormitory - Involving a Rent Increase of More Than 30% - All Residents Appeal for Social Assistance

The YMCA Sichuan Road Branch dormitory has 890 rooms, divided into single, double, four-person, and dormitory rooms, housing more than 200 residents, mostly students from various schools. Since the Shanghai war, the rent has been increased three times, exceeding more than double the original rent. At the beginning of September this year, the association issued another notice stating that from October 1st, the rent would be uniformly increased by 126/100, or only by 36/100, and all necessary supplies would be canceled, and 10% of the new rent price would be charged for the tea room tip.

Increase in Total Amount

Reaching more than 139%. Therefore, all the residents jointly signed a letter to the board of directors (September 27), requesting the withdrawal of the original proposal to increase the rent, to openly discuss a solution, and elected 11 representatives to be responsible for negotiations. According to the staff, the general secretary Wu Lifu was in charge, but Wu Lifu said that the staff was responsible, pushing each other, and the representatives could not contact to proceed. The residents then submitted all the rent payable to the Special First Court through three representatives. Unexpectedly, the branch staff Sun Yongjia suddenly reported to the Central Police Station that these three representatives who collected the rent and

Submitted to the Court

"Obtained money by fraud" (October 30, there is a case at the Central Police Station). The police station then sent detectives to arrest the three representatives. Later, after the three representatives showed the receipt from the Special First Court, the police station, based on the facts, found that the YMCA staff Sun Yongjia had made a false accusation, and after reprimanding Sun, released the three representatives who had been falsely accused. After this incident, the residents repeatedly requested the distribution of income and expenditure accounts. A week later, the branch staff announced a signed bill, but after detailed investigation by the residents, it was found that the quantities and prices were inflated a lot. Just taking the item of hot water for washing face as an example, only two hours are provided every morning, but it consumes as much as five tons of coal per month. Moreover, according to

the staff, Kailuan coal oil is used for supply, but it is not enough, so it needs to be purchased externally. It has been investigated and found that Kailuan supplies a total of 50 tons per month, and there is no reason to purchase it externally. Moreover, the price of Kailuan coal in October was only 170-180 yuan per ton, and in November it was 226 yuan, while the staff's account was as high as 800 yuan per ton, an inflation of four times. Calculated in this way, each person needs 92 cents for one wash. At about 12 noon the day before yesterday (November 3), the branch staff Sun Yongjia suddenly led the tea room to dismantle the bed of resident Ji Weihong at No. 69

(at this time, Mr. Ji was away on business and not in the dormitory), and arbitrarily moved his private belongings together. After the resident returned in the evening and learned of this unexpected incident, he negotiated with branch staff Sun Yongjia, but Mr. Sun avoided meeting him and reported to the police station for a factual investigation. It is heard that tenant Ji has filed a lawsuit with the Special First Court yesterday, demanding compensation for losses, while all the tenants are working together to fight for their rights based on reason, and at the same time appeal to impartial people in society for assistance.

### Newspaper Vendor Shot and Injured by Japanese Soldiers on the Way to Sell Newspapers

Newspaper vendor Hua Tugen from Nantong, 39 years old, lived at No. 7 Languifang, Lan Road, Yangshupu, Hudong, Shanghai, and made a living by selling newspapers. At about 8:30 AM yesterday, Hua obtained various Japanese newspapers and carried them

to sell them by calling out the news. Unexpectedly, when he reached the intersection of Kunming Road near Zhoushan Road, he was shot by a Japanese sentry stationed there. He was shot in the left calf, the bullet pierced through the bone, and he fell to the ground in a pool of blood.

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor: I have read the news article "Accusations of Public Insult Due to Housing Disputes" published in your newspaper's local news column on the 2nd of this month, which does not conform to the facts. My client, Zhao Binglin, previously rented the downstairs house at No. 9 Guizhou Road from Zhang Lianting and opened the Jiatai Transportation Company. Suddenly, on the 4th of last month, he was instigated by Zhang Lianting and Lei Xiaofu to use violence and coercion to drive out his family members and employees, and sealed the store door, hindering people from exercising their rights. He filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai First Special District Court, which has already sentenced the offenders (30th year, Zi Zi Yu No. 55 Cave). Therefore, the statement that Ming Jiatai Company withdrew all its assets and account books, etc., and did not pay the rent is not true. Moreover, my lawyer is exercising his duties based on the intentions of the client and the facts stated. It is obviously harmful to my lawyer's reputation to publicly list my lawyer as a defendant. In addition to proceeding according to law, I would like to ask your newspaper to make corrections to show the truth. Sincerely, Lawyer Song Yaoji, December 3, 30th year.

To the Editor: I have read the news article with the headline "Accusations of Public Insult Due to Housing Disputes" on the seventh page of the second section of your issue No. 24,331 on the 2nd of this month, which stated that "Lawyer Song Yaoji and his client Zhao Binglin were recently sued by Lei Xiaofu through lawyers Wang Yaotang, Qian Zheng, and Zhao Zuwei in the Criminal Court of the Special First Court for false accusations and defamation," which is completely inconsistent with the facts. In the case of Zhao Binglin suing Zhang Lianting and Lei Xiaofu for obstructing rights, my three lawyers defended the defendants Zhang Lianting and Lei Xiaofu. As for the case of Lei Xiaofu suing Zhao Binglin and Song Yaoji for false accusations and defamation, my lawyers did not accept Lei Xiaofu's entrustment to handle it. I hereby send this letter to request corrections. Sincerely, Lawyers Wang Yaotang, Qian Zheng, Zhao Zuwei.

To the Editor: I have read the news article with the headline "Datong News Agency's Rent Dispute Pending Judgment" on the 3rd of this month, which stated that "Unexpectedly, Wang Runtao, due to the recent lack of housing and high prices, dug up someone to coerce tenants to move out," which is completely inconsistent with the facts. I sued the Datong News Agency because the agency violated the lease agreement by subletting the house to others, which led to my involvement in the lawsuit. The evidence is true, and the high-priced digging is completely fabricated and slanderous. I hereby send this letter to request corrections. Sincerely, Wang Runtao.

After the speech, the proposals were discussed, and the resolutions are as follows:

(3) The location of the parachute tower will be initially built in the sports field for the elementary level and in the grand parade ground for the advanced level. The General Association is requested to send personnel to design it. (4) The branch's address will be temporarily borrowed from the Youth League headquarters. It will be rebuilt when funds permit. (5) The branch's manufacturing plant should be planned and established by personnel sent by the General Association to Guilin. (6) The branch's members should be recruited in accordance with Articles 13 of the branch's charter and should be carried out as soon as possible. (7) The member training plan should be submitted to the General Association, requesting the dispatch of educational cadres and materials to Guilin for preparation. (8) The work plan and budget will be prepared by the standing committee. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned at around 3:00 PM. At 4:00 PM, Chairman Huang hosted a dinner at the Lequn Society. At 6:00 PM, Deputy Chief of Staff Bai hosted all the directors to watch the play "Loyal King Li Xiucheng".

Performing in Various Regions: Deputy Chief of Staff Bai plans to invite the gliding personnel who came to Guilin this time to perform in various regions. However, their travel leave is about to expire, and they will soon return to Chengdu. The branch and Deputy Chief of Staff Bai urgently sent telegrams to the Military Affairs Commission, the Director of the Military and Political Office, and Director Huang, extending the time for their travel leave so that they can perform in various regions.

Xin Zhong Donates One Aircraft: The Guangxi Branch of the Chinese Gliding Association has been very active in its work since its establishment on the 4th. Many people from all walks of life are happy to support it. According to the person in charge of the branch speaking to the reporter, in addition to the "Dagong Daily No. 2" donated by the Dagong Daily for the use of the Guilin branch, Director Zhang Guorui donated a glider to the association. The aircraft will be named "Xin Zhong" (New China). The branch plans to order it from the General Association immediately, and the naming ceremony will be held in Guilin soon.

### Second Act of the West Youth Basketball League: Fuli Lian Miserably Loses to Giants Yesterday, Group B Storm and Tongren Triumph, All Three Games Result in One-Sided Victories

The second act of the West Youth Basketball League began last night. In the two Group B games, Tongren Yijia Ban easily defeated Chen You 38-17, with the first half being 23-3, a one-sided process. In the next game, Storm defeated Ling You 38-11, with the first half being 23-4, also a one-sided situation. The main event of the evening was the Group A battle between Fuli Lian and Giants. Fuli Lian made its debut in a brand-new posture. Fuli Lian was originally composed of old players from Xufang, with no outsiders in the team. The name Fuli Lian also takes the meaning of restoring the old business and reuniting friendships. However, some mistakenly thought that it was composed of Fudan alumni, which led to a large number of Fudan alumni requesting to join in recent days, much to the dismay of the host, Mr. Dong Xiaopei. In yesterday's game, Fuli Lian showed an unusual performance. Tao, Zou, Dong (Yangfeng), and others' skillful shots were repeatedly unsuccessful. Many good opportunities were missed by a hair's breadth. Giants took advantage of the favorable situation and had a smooth ride, easily defeating Fuli Lian 28-12. The game began with Smith scoring a free throw to open the record. Sha Sijin and Yelong scored seven points in one breath. Tao Shaosheng forced his way through the siege and finally scored. After 11-2, Dong Yangfeng broke through the basket, and the first half ended with 11-4. Fuli Lian was far behind. In the second half, Giants added six points in one breath. Dong Yangfeng fouled out four times and was sent off. Song Qihou was brought on, but Fuli Lian still showed no improvement. Giants' score soared. Fuli Lian finally suffered a惨 defeat with 12-28.

### Uncertainty in Sino-Japanese-American Peace Talks, Gold Market Fluctuates Irregularly

Yesterday, the cash gold market in Shanghai fluctuated and rose, with prices surpassing the 15,000 yuan mark. With the Sino-Japanese-American talks on the verge of collapse, the market was confused by conflicting bullish and bearish news. US dollar notes rose to around 30 yuan, and everyone was consistently bullish. Supply and demand in the secret market were evenly matched. Tianyuan squeezed in 830 taels, and draft merchants and securities firms each squeezed in around 350 taels. Gonghe, Shihe, and Mingfeng's squeezing was also strong. However, Chengji and Shunyuan each sold 400 taels, Yongcheng sold over 500 taels, and Xianghe, Lianxing, Tongkangyong each sold about 200 taels, causing the price to rise from 14,300 yuan to 15,500 yuan before falling back. The market closed with a squeeze of 770 yuan. A total of 20,960 taels were traded throughout the day. Ornaments made from gold rose 90 yuan, while silver remained unchanged.

Cash Rushes Past 15,000 Yuan

The market opened at 9:00 AM at 14,400 yuan per bar (10 taels), 30 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. When Tianyuan, Xianghe Securities Firm, Cash Firm, Hesheng, and others bought in, it immediately rebounded by 350 yuan to 14,750 yuan. Chengji, Wanli, Mingfeng Securities Firm, Tianjin Gang, Xianghe, Xiangxing, and Yonglai forcefully sold, immediately causing it to drop by 450 yuan to 14,300 yuan. When news came that US dollar notes were rising and foreign exchange was softening, it triggered a buying frenzy. Tianyuan, Xiangxing, Yong Mingfeng, Gonghe, Shihe, draft merchants, and securities firms successively absorbed the supply, and the price gradually increased. It was especially strong at noon, suddenly breaking through 15,000 yuan, reaching 15,300 yuan. The market closed at noon at 15,280 yuan. In the afternoon, it immediately raised by 220 yuan to 15,500 yuan. Tianyuan, Hongqing, Yongcheng, and Dalai forcefully sold, and Yongcheng dumped its supply, causing the price to suddenly drop by 550 yuan to 14,950 yuan. Draft merchants, securities firms, Hesheng, Gonghe, and Mingfeng successively entered forcefully, increasing it by 400 yuan to 15,350 yuan. Yongcheng, Xiangxing, Yongxianghe, and Tianyuan forcefully sold again, falling back to 15,050 yuan. Tianyuan re-entered, and Deda closed at 15,200 yuan, a recovery of 770 yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of 1,200 yuan. The cash firm's own-brand gold was sold at 15,400 yuan at the store, with the purchase price being 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.

Gold Ornaments in Jewelry Stores Also See Squeeze

The selling price of gold ornaments in jewelry stores, both Datongxing and Xintongxing, initially rose by 30 yuan in the morning, and then rose again by 80 yuan twice to 1,580 yuan before falling back to 1,540 yuan. Finally, it closed at 1,560 yuan (purchase price reduced by 150 yuan), a recovery of 90 yuan. Silver was still listed at 22 yuan, with the black market at 17 or 18 yuan.

### US Dollar Notes Likely to Reach 30 Yuan, Black Market Exchange Rate Tightens

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the official rates quoted by the Central Bank and HSBC. The exchange rates of 14 foreign and Chinese banks were also stable. The black market exchange rates for British and American currencies continued to tighten sharply. US dollar notes broke through the 30 yuan mark. Importers were eager to settle their accounts, and Chinese merchants took the opportunity to raise prices. As a result, the British exchange rate softened to 1/25 or possibly settled. Some importers who were not allowed to apply for US$3.375 settled at a premium. There were few transactions in the first half of the day. Compared to the previous day's closing prices, both British and American currencies squeezed tighter by 125. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds rise sharply by 20 yuan along with the price of cash gold. British gold notes soared by 10 yuan, and US dollar notes were likely to reach the 30 yuan mark, with the final rate being 29 yuan and 8 jiao, a recovery of 1 yuan and 3 jiao compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes fell by 1 jiao. Canadian notes and Philippine notes both trended upward. Japanese gold notes and Korean military notes trended downward. The former was 2 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, the middle was 2 yuan and 5 jiao, and the latter was 3 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen.

Hong Kong, 3rd (Wednesday): This morning, the foreign exchange market opened abnormally sluggish. All exchange rates remained unchanged. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

Tianjin, 3rd (Wednesday): This morning, the foreign exchange market opened stable. All exchange rates stood at their original rates without any upward or downward movement.

### Gold Is To Blame, Yarn Market Fluctuates Accordingly

The yarn market's trend is calm and stable, but most people are bearish because the amount of short selling is sufficient. However, large investors are still buying in, given that the gold, Shuangma futures, and gold are all firm and expensive, and they are struggling on the bullish side, so the swirling force is exceptionally strong. Comparing the yarn prices of other exchanges, Bianma is unique. However, the Bianma market is still loose and weak. The high price for 20-count Shuangma yarn is 2,485 yuan, and the low price is 2,395 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon with a sharp rise. The opening price was 2,565 yuan. However, as soon as the high price appeared, it immediately went down, falling to 2,455 yuan. However, taking the lead of the yarn market, it gradually rose and then rebounded to 2,485 yuan. However, the leading side is still short, and it loosened to 2,435 yuan. The closing price was 2,443 yuan, 45 yuan outside the market.

Shuangma opened very flat in the morning. The opening price was 2,420 yuan. After a short time, due to short covering, it rose to 2,450 yuan. Afterwards, it went down slightly after the exchange opened, and the short side was active again, with more selling pressure, falling to 2,395 yuan. However, as the price was weak, buyers' enthusiasm was strong, and it rose again to 2,440 yuan, swirling for a long time. By the time the market closed, with the price of gold rising, the short side covered its positions, and the market gradually rose to close at 2,472 yuan. It was found that the half-day turnover was statistically 2,950 bales.

Gold Bianma futures, from continued decline to recovery, the situation is still floating and uncertain. The reason is that the international trend has been unpredictable recently. The complexity of the news makes it difficult to choose. Therefore, there is no sign of emphasis on the trend. When it opened in the morning, although the Yanghua performance was strong, the factory orders tended to be weak first. Therefore, under the influence of the general reliance on spot yarn, December only opened at 2,480 yuan, and January opened at 2,550 yuan, which was already stable. February initially opened at 2,630 yuan, initially showing a hard state. By the time of the second round, it was appropriate that the exchange and factory orders once again hovered and fell. The bullish side was even more apprehensive. Under the dumping by the gold firms and securities firms, it once fell to the low end of the day. Unexpectedly, when it was close to the noon closing, the gold market suddenly rose sharply, and both spot yarn and futures yarn rose in line with each other, picking up about 30 to 40 yuan in the closing of each month's period. In the afternoon, the firm rise in the exchange caused the bullish side to be firm. The market atmosphere still saw a slight increase under the absorption of retail investors. However, due to the situation, it was not very stable. The result of the rise and fall throughout the day was that each month's period rose by more than 20 yuan to 50 yuan. The list is as follows,

November January February

Opening 2480.0 2550.0 2630.0

Highest 2515.0 2600.0 2670.0

Lowest 2438.0 2510.0 2595.0

Closing 2500.0 2600.0 2635.0

Comparison Rise 40.0 Rise 50.0 Rise 34.0

### Spot Cotton Market Stable

The spot cotton situation is flat, but with gold trending upward, cargo owners' constitutions are more secure.

The New York cotton market saw prices rise due to buying from Wall Street and the textile industry. Yesterday's closing prices were up about 14 or 5 pounds from the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to short selling by cotton merchants, but subsequently rose due to buying by a large number of speculators and the situation in the Far East not being very bad. As a result, yesterday's closing prices each rose by about 3 or 4 sibi.

### Although Government Bonds See Recovery, the Situation Still Seeks Stability

The government bond gray market saw a lot of turbulence yesterday but did not diminish its hesitant state. It was up 7 or 8 jiao in the morning and suddenly down 8 or 9 jiao in the afternoon, indicating that people's hearts were abnormally flustered. In this time of complex news, both bulls and bears felt helpless. In the afternoon, there were bearish rumors in the foreign business community, such as the Hong Kong HSBC Bank moving to Singapore, which further dampened people's spirits. Government bonds were already in a weak state, so how could they withstand the attack of rumors? Yesterday morning, in the slow price increases of Lianyi, Tongyi, Xiexing, Yuangong, Mao, etc., they gradually trended higher. Type C saw over 68 yuan and 7 jiao, but it failed to stand firm due to the selling of Tongsheng Shunxing. People's hearts suddenly emptied in the afternoon, and Shengxing continued to sell. Type C opened suddenly, breaking 8 yuan to 67 yuan and 8 jiao. Afterwards, because Tongkang Juxin had some demand, it recovered two or three jiao. The result was still up one or two jiao to six jiao. Type D did not open proudly in the afternoon. The turnover was about 1.45 million yuan. Here is a brief table:

Stock trading: 200 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 39 yuan and 5 jiao.

The opening of the public stock market was slightly higher, but then gradually declined because buyers lacked support and sellers sold as soon as prices were high. As a result, the prices of both stocks were similar to the closing prices of the previous day.

### Piece Goods Slightly Swirl, Soon Soaring Upward

Factory Cloth Yesterday's market swirled, loosened in the morning, and gradually rose in the afternoon. As a result, coarse cloth rose 9 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the previous day, fine cloth diagonal lines rose about 1 yuan, and some dyed cloth rose 1 or 2 yuan. Huadie coarse cloth Nongkai fell 5 jiao, gradually decreasing to 90 yuan and 5 jiao. It rebounded to 91 yuan and 7 jiao and a half at noon. In the afternoon, it rose from 92 yuan to close at 93 yuan, a recovery of 5 jiao compared to the previous day. The turnover in the street was over 300 pieces of coarse cloth, blue cloth, line neirong cloth, etc., and over 100 pieces of coarse cloth color cloth, etc. from the Zhejiang East gang.

Dong Cloth The most swirling market atmosphere is mediocre, and sales are trending downward. The market rose quickly due to gold prices rising and bullish rumors spreading. The closing price of the exchange's Caiqiu fine cloth futures for this month was 86 yuan, and January was 89 yuan, both rising 1 yuan from the previous day. February was 91 yuan, rising 1 yuan and a half. The leading fine cloth factory order in the spot market swirled at 89 yuan for a long time in the morning and also rose to 90 yuan and 5 jiao at closing in the afternoon.

### Flour Price Fixed at 40 Yuan

—Plus a Fee of Two Jiao—

Yesterday's foreign flour market was stable. Because the Public Works Bureau has begun to allocate to actual consumption households and announced the public sale price of 40 yuan plus a fee of 2 jiao, some actual consumption is no longer being absorbed from the market, and even scattered customers who actually consume no longer wait and see but inquire about the market. Holders of goods have no opportunity to attempt to raise prices and no worries about unified low sales, so they also sell with the market. Therefore, the market situation is very stable. Xizhan registered Jinlong has stood at a price of about 40 yuan, up to 41 yuan. However, due to the need for customers to store and export the various powders from Dongzhan that have been approved for re-export, the selling price still needs to be outside of 50 yuan. Bran only opened at 3 gold coins, a small package of 54 yuan and a half, about 200 or 300 packages. Wheat inventories have reached a point of exhaustion, and Durke wheat is shouting 73 or 4 yuan, it is said.

### Edible Oil and Grains, Speculators Still Control

The market situation for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes remained consistently high yesterday. Because the actual sales were still not bleak, those who held the goods were trying to control the market, so the market continued to rise. As a result, edible oil rose another 5 yuan to 10 yuan, and soybeans and corn both rose 1 or 2 yuan. The total market opened with 50 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 300 cans of Jiangbei raw oil, another 20 barrels, 600 dan of Dayou Factory refined oil, over 200 barrels of Rihua Factory vegetable oil, 100 dan of Dachang New Factory vegetable oil, 2 units each of Lide Taishan Dasheng Factory vegetable oil, 600 packages of Tianjin Xinjinyuan and 300 packages of Chen Jinyuan, another 300 packages of green beans, over 2,000 packages of corn spot goods, and over 500 contracts for futures.

### Sugar Speculators Are Apprehensive, Although Prices Plunge, Transactions Are Still Clear

Yesterday's sugar market saw even more bleak sales, and the inventory on hand actually increased daily. Therefore, speculators were extremely apprehensive and sold out in the market, so prices continued to fall by 7 to over 10 yuan. The company's futures for three or four coarse white sugar were priced at 196 yuan to 90 yuan for the tenth date of the month, down 7 yuan, and 294 yuan for the twentieth date, a wide drop of 15 yuan. Spot goods of two or four coarse white imported in November were 204 yuan to 195 yuan and a half, 96 yuan and 7 yuan in the afternoon, 4 yuan and a half, and 8 yuan and a half, 198 yuan in October. 94 yuan, 92 or 3 yuan in the afternoon, 10 yuan, 197 yuan in September. 93 yuan, 88 yuan and 85 yuan in the afternoon, 183 yuan in August, the same price in the afternoon, 176 yuan for Hong Kong coarse sugar, and 7 yuan, 168 yuan for Dutch red sugar, 63 yuan in the afternoon, and 10 yuan.

### Cigarettes Can Be Transported, Those with Official Stamps Are Especially Popular

Cigarettes continued to gradually increase in price. The reason is that the factory lacks raw materials, and the goods distributed to the same industry cannot be supplied in large quantities. Furthermore, because of the government's price restrictions, cigarettes are not included in this exception. Therefore, those who hold goods wait for a good price to sell. Recently, because transportation permits have been issued, Hakka gangs have been searching for all kinds of goods with official stamps in the market. Because workers at each machine in Maotai are on strike, the goods stored with the above items cannot be cleared, so the spot goods are mostly in short supply. Prices such as Big Ben cigarettes are 2,990 yuan per case, Lao Dao brand stamped at 2,850 yuan, Fairy brand at 1,790 yuan, Wuhua brand at 1,880 yuan, and Pinhai brand at 2,110 yuan, all trending higher than the previous day. Daily necessities such as matches, soap, candles, etc. have temporarily passed peacefully, feeling slightly chic. Because the factory has news of price increases,

### Noodles Rise Too Much, Naturally, They Cannot but Fall

The reason why filament noodles were raised so much earlier is that Longkou noodles reached 460 or 70 yuan, which can be said to be the highest possible. Recently, with the price of goods mostly turning downward, this is an exception even though it is a product to be sold in the winter. The price is softening, and it has fallen by dozens of yuan before and after. Yesterday's market saw Longkou noodles sold for 400 yuan, with the rest returning.

### Black Iron Billets Suddenly Show Their Edge: Originally Valued at Around $11,000 per Bundle

Black iron billets, due to the rush by the Fujianese to purchase them, coupled with the interruption of supplies from Hong Kong, suddenly shone in the market, which was characterized by scant inventory and a sluggish atmosphere. As a result, asking prices rose again. It is reported that yesterday, a 2,000-pound bundle was originally valued at around $11,000, while 200-pound assorted varieties were selling for as much as $1,100 to $1,150 per case, an increase of $1,000 and $150 respectively compared to the previous market.

### Moscow Then and Now

— He Kai

In recent years, the speed of Moscow's transformation in appearance has been astonishing. A visit to Western European cities after ten or twenty years rarely reveals any signs of change. This is because those cities were mostly built long ago.

However, Moscow has leaped from a large village to become a modern, so-called socialist central city. The speed of its transformation is naturally beyond the imagination of ordinary people.

The Russian writer Kuprin, who fled abroad after the revolution, returned to his hometown of Moscow after more than a decade. Standing in the center of the city, he couldn't help but exclaim, "This is not Moscow!" In fact, Moscow has completely changed its appearance, making it unrecognizable to those who knew it in the past.

More than a decade ago, Moscow had a population of only about two million, but today it has surged to four and a half million. This shows the extent to which Moscow has expanded in this short period. In the city center, the low-rise butcher shops and vegetable stores that once lined Gorky Street have been swept away, replaced by Europe's largest ten-story hotel, the "Moskva Hotel," and the People's Committee Building, made of dark gray marble. Moscow's "Nanjing Road" - Gorky Street - has had the buildings on both sides demolished in turn, greatly widening the road, turning the curved road into a straight one, and building a square in the center of the road. In short, Moscow has been completely transformed into a modern city.

The Soviet Union also built Moscow's first subway, which is known as the largest in the world, with a depth of up to seventy meters. The interiors of each station are large and lined with columns, truly deserving of the title "Underground Palace."

The Moscow River, which forms a W-shape around the city, has a scarce water supply. Therefore, the authorities built the Moscow-Volga Canal, introducing the abundant waters of the Volga River. As a result, Moscow has gradually acquired the appearance of a large city.

The transformation of Moscow is based on the "Moscow Reconstruction Ten-Year Plan" passed in 1935. According to this plan, the new Moscow will seek to preserve the basic outline of Moscow, which has a history of development, while fundamentally transforming the streets and squares in order to build a modern city.

The area of old Moscow was 28,500 hectares, while the area of new Moscow is 60,000 hectares, almost two and a half times larger. The suburbs of Moscow will also be attached to the city of Moscow, building a brand-new city of 16,000 hectares.

However, a ten-kilometer diameter of forest land will remain around Greater Moscow, and new forest zones will be established where there is no forest. As for housing, there are no plans to build skyscrapers as shocking as those in New York, nor to build two-story houses or bungalows for a single family. It is planned to build exquisite six- to eight-story apartments.

As part of this ten-year plan, the subway was completed several years ago, and other projects are also being implemented step by step. Unfortunately, war suddenly broke out at this time, leaving Moscow with no time to complete this plan. If it could be given a few more years, Moscow would surely have become the most modern city in the world.

### Environment

— Gao Yang

We often hear people say that growing up in a good environment can cultivate useful talents; in a bad environment, social scum can be created.

In fact, this statement is also very vague. Where exactly is the standard of "good" and "bad"? What should be used as a benchmark? I think that today, at least these two principles should be used to distinguish between good and bad.

First, one must be worthy of the country, the nation, and humanity, and every move must not deviate from this scope.

Second, one must actively transform, rather than passively endure.

In this way, we first determine the distinction between "good" and "bad." As long as we do not deviate from these two principles, then the "bitterness" and "sweetness" of the environment do not matter much—as long as they do not violate the above two points.

Therefore, in the eyes of some people, dancing, gambling, drinking, and whoring are good environments; while fighting in ice and snow, wind and rain, is too bad in their eyes. In fact, we say: the former are昏庸people, the蛀蟲of society; the latter are 肉搏 the environment for everyone's survival. This is for the country, the nation, and it is also active.

Of course, we do not deny that the environment can affect a person's thoughts and actions. For example, parents who like to gamble often bring their children to watch gambling, and as a result, it creates a gambling mentality and behavior in the children. Furthermore, when two children with different treatments are in the same family, it will cause a poor child to steal. Even adults are always like this, in the same professional field, or a circle of life, it can create a certain kind of people, the so-called "near vermilion, one gets stained red; near ink, one gets stained black", its principle is in this!

However, we cannot admit that only the environment controls people, while ignoring people's ability to control the environment, and even the great power to create the environment. First, we must distinguish between "good" and "bad" according to the above principles. This requires first relying on our own understanding to distinguish the environment in which we are located, and not allowing it to reverse black and white, and confuse our minds. Second, no matter how bad the environment we are in, we should make up our minds that it is like a ship sailing in the ocean, which needs a "helmsman" with a firm will. We want to drive the environment, not be driven by the environment so that we are triumphant, but do not know where we are going!

Therefore, we say that we must be the masters who overcome the environment, use the environment, and control the environment, and never be puppets of the environment, idols of the environment! And more importantly:

——We must be the warriors who create the environment!

### Bicycle for Treating Illnesses

— Zhang Qiao

A young man suffering from infantile paralysis was able to regain muscle control with the help of an exercise device created by his father, allowing him to stay out of the "iron lung" all day. This instrument is made of lead-painted long and short tubes, with three hinged gears, a chain, foot pedals, and hand grips. When he holds the hand grips with both hands, he steps on the foot pedals with his feet, which helps the development of his arm muscles. There are many exercise devices currently being tested to help patients with infantile paralysis, and this is just one example.

Fifteen Dad, Let's Go Busking!

"Dad, if you still consider me your daughter, please don't do this kind of business anymore!" She expressed her opposition in a very firm tone.

"If we don't eat this kind of food, are we just going to drink the northwest wind?" Autumn Begonia asked, shrugging his hands, appearing helpless.

"It won't come to that," Mei Shi put down a qing cloth dagua she was mending and said with a serious expression: "I've studied for seven or eight years after all, and I still have some skills to make a living. No matter what, I won't just sit by and watch our father and daughter starve to death."

Autumn Begonia lowered his head, sitting on the edge of the kang, listening to his daughter's crisp words, and felt extremely uncomfortable. At most fourteen or fifteen years ago, Luo Xiangqi also used this tone to discuss family affairs with him, but now there is no news of her!

"For the past two or three months, you have been so tired for the life of our father and daughter. If I am still ignorant, I can't let you go out and work hard alone!" Mei Bao frowned tightly and said very sadly.

"But, Shanghai is too terrible! Letting a girl like you go out and mix around, I really can't put my heart down." Autumn Begonia slowly raised his head, looked at Mei Bao, and said with a sad face.

The lamplight shone on his face, and only a thin, withered yellow skin could be seen. (279)

### New York Sunday Mirror Movie Selection: Errol Flynn and Bette Davis Elected

— Lian

Best Picture... Gone with the Wind

The New York Sunday Mirror, with a daily circulation of 3.5 million, recently held a special movie election to select the best male and female actors of the year and "the best movie I think is from September 1940 to March 1941." Voters were all readers of the newspaper. As a result, Errol Flynn was elected as the best male actor, and Bette Davis won the title of best female actor. I think the movie fans in Shanghai have already made a judgment on the acting skills of these two artists.

In this election, no fewer than 262 film artists received votes. Errol Flynn's votes were 16,714, which was 937 votes more than Clark Gable, who came in second. Bette Davis received 22,010 votes, which was 6,465 votes more than Diana Durbin, who came in second.

The best twelve male film artists are as follows: (1) Errol Flynn, (2) Clark Gable, (3) Tyrone Power, (4) Spencer Tracy, (5) Nelson Eddy, (6) Kim Auclaire, (7) Miguel Ronn, (8) Ray Milland, (9) Robert Taylor, (10) Cary Grant, (11) Gary Cooper (12) Bob Hope

The best twelve female film artists are as follows: (1) Bette Davis, (2) Diana Durbin, (3) Tyja Lynn, (4) Jean Cagisse, (5) Alice Faye, (6) Irene Dunne, (7) Jenny MacDonald (8) Lana Turner, (9) Dorothy Lamour, (10) Vivien Leigh, (11) Olivia de Havilland, (12) Betty Grable.

Miguel Ronn, who was so popular last year, only ranked seventh this year, which was quite unexpected for most people. Kim Auclaire, a martial arts film star, is very popular with movie fans in small towns in the United States, so he ranked sixth. As for Hedy Lamarr, Joan Crawford, Bing Crosby, and Don Ameche, who have always had good acting skills and many movie fans, they were not on the list, which was also unexpected by most people. "Gone with the Wind" was elected as the best film.

### Perfumed Letter Tears Before the Performance

— Jiang Qi

"Perfumed Letter Tears" will be performed by the China Travel Troupe at Tiangong tonight, which brings me great comfort.

In terms of personal friendship, I am happy for my old friend Tao Qin's debut performance, but what makes me happy is that in the Chinese drama scene, which has been plagued by script shortages for years, a new and powerful playwright has now been added.

Its choice of material and writing skills will naturally be criticized by discerning audiences. There is no need for me to introduce it here first, but what I want to introduce is Tao Qin's humble writing attitude and the courage to overcome setbacks.

Regardless of whether the performance is successful or not, I know that the author has exhausted his efforts. "Perfumed Letter Tears" was completed very early, and it has been rewritten several times, and opinions from many friends have been solicited and added or deleted repeatedly. Although this is a spirit that a playwright should have, as far as I know, there are not many writers who can have this spirit.

The script has been sent out again and again, and has been rejected again and again. This may be because there are some flaws in the writing, or perhaps because the script was written by an unknown person. However, now, it is finally being performed. This is certainly due to Mr. Huaiqiu's lack of contempt for unknown dramas, but Tao Qin's courage to overcome setbacks is equally worthy of our praise.

"Perfumed Letter Tears" is being solemnly performed by the China Travel Troupe this time, starring Ms. Tang Ruoqing, who has been away for a long time, and directed by the famous director Bu Wancang. In addition to my old friend feeling supreme comfort, I hope he can always retain the attitude and spirit of writing at this time, and give us more great and more beneficial dramas for our nation in the near future.

In several other places, he often avoided me, and never wanted to live with anyone. Even close as I am, he would not let me touch his skin. Now, because of his leg injury, I have just washed and applied medicine for him, but he is so shy, how can it not make people suspicious? Also, his smile is very charming, and does not resemble a man's attitude, which makes me often daydream. Xu Jing thought, Liu Yinying revealed half of his face from the quilt and looked at Xu Jing, saying: "Brother Jing, thank you for helping. You should sit down and rest too." Xu Jing said: "I don't need much effort. How does your leg feel?" As he spoke, he sat down on the edge of the kang. Liu Yinying said: "After applying the medicine, I feel a little cooler and don't feel pain. This medicine is very good. You should put it away, it may be useful in the future." Xu Jing nodded and said yes. He also said: "At first, I was very worried when I saw you hit by an arrow, but now I am much relieved. The army will be mobilized the day after tomorrow, and you will probably be able to go with the army." Liu Yinying said: "I have a minor injury, and with such good medicine, I will naturally recover faster. I will get up tomorrow. We are in the army, entering and exiting the battlefield, these small injuries are not worth worrying about. A man's seven-foot body should be on a horse to kill thieves, and on foot to write reports. In the future, I want to have a big battle with the bandits. If I can capture the King Chuang, I will not only avenge the country, but also quickly fulfill my heart." Xu Jing listened to Liu Yinying's generous and enthusiastic words, and felt that if Liu Yinying was a daughter, how could he have such strong martial arts? Secondly, he has a strong sense of patriotism and chivalry, and he is indeed a strange man. It was only then that he would say such words, and he did not seem like a skirt-wearing person. (325)
