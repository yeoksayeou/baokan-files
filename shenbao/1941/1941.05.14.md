### Exposure of Internal Rifts in Germany: Hess Flees to England on the Opportunity; Political Views in Serious Conflict with Hitler; Hess Engaged in Heartfelt Conversation with Friends in England Yesterday

London: The British Prime Minister's residence issued a public statement last night, reporting that Nazi Party leader and Deputy Führer of Germany, Hess, had flown from Germany to Scotland. The statement read as follows: "On Saturday night, May 10th, a British patrol reported a German Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighter plane flying over the Scottish coast towards Glasgow. At the time, it was believed that such a German plane could not carry enough fuel for a round trip between Germany and Scotland, so the report was deemed inaccurate. Shortly thereafter, a report was received that a Messerschmitt Bf 20 fighter plane, with its cannons loaded with bullets, had crashed near Glasgow. Subsequently, a German officer was seen to jump out of the plane with a parachute, his ankle broken. He was immediately taken to a hospital in Glasgow. The officer initially identified himself as 'Hahn,' and then stated that he was Rudolf Hess, carrying photographs of himself taken over the years to prove that he was indeed the German Deputy Führer, Hess. Several people present who knew Hess confirmed that the photos were indeed of Hess. Therefore, the British Foreign Office has dispatched a member who had close contact with Hess before the war to fly to Glasgow and meet him in the hospital." The Minister of Information, Cooper, personally read this public statement to journalists in a tense atmosphere at the Ministry of Information last night.

Hess, a man of imposing stature with piercing eyes, is one of the Nazi leaders. Although he has never been as prominent as Air Marshal Göring or Propaganda Minister Goebbels in the Nazi cabinet, it is said that he has considerable influence over Hitler. He is 45 years old and ranks third in the party, only behind Hitler and Göring. When the German army invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, Hitler stated in parliament: "If I should die, my successor will be Göring, and after Göring, Hess. You should all regard them as leaders as you regard me." At times, besides Hitler, Hess's photos were the most frequently published in newspapers and shown in films. Last month, there was news that Hess had flown to Spain to deliver paintings to General Franco, but German officials subsequently denied it. Twelve days ago, Hess met with Mariano, the leader of the Spanish fascist group and Spanish Minister of the Navy, in Munich. After Hitler's failed coup in 1923, he was imprisoned with Hess. When Hitler came to power, Hess served as the director of the liaison department, providing Hitler with the information he needed. Hess spent his childhood in Egypt and later attended a British school in Alexandria. When the war broke out in 1914, he was unable to enter a British university. He usually only wore the brown shirts of the Sturmabteilung or the black shirts of the Schutzstaffel and never wore other clothes. He is generally mild-mannered, taciturn but efficient, and lives as simply as Hitler. (Reuters, 13th)

London: Last night, rumors circulated that Hess, the third most powerful figure in the Nazi regime, who had escaped to Scotland by parachute, may be carrying peace terms. This incident reveals a rift in the German cabinet. (United Press, 13th)

London: Doctors have examined Hess and found that his nerves are not deranged and that his physique is healthy. Hess did not bring any peace proposals. He came in opposition to the Nazi authorities and has now been transferred to an undisclosed destination. (Reuters, 13th)

London: Mr. Kirkpatrick, who worked at the British Embassy in Berlin from 1933 to 1938 and had a close friendship with Hess, met with the Nazi leader last night and easily recognized him. It is reported that during the meeting, Hess spoke freely without any reservations. Mr. Kirkpatrick attended the conferences in Godesberg, Berchtesgaden, and Munich and served as a counselor at the British Embassy and once as chargé d'affaires. (Reuters, 13th)

Turkey: The wife of the leader of the German National Socialist Party in the capital, Hess, arrived here by plane at 7:00 PM today. Only after disembarking did she learn that her husband had disappeared. (Havas, 13th)

### Announcement by the National Socialist Party Headquarters: Denouncing Hess's Delusional Peace Fantasies

Berlin: The German National Socialist Party issued the following official statement yesterday: "Party comrade Hess has been suffering from a serious illness for many years. Therefore, Führer Hitler had strictly forbidden him from flying. It is known that Hess flew out by plane on the 10th of this month and has not yet returned. A letter left by Hess reveals signs of mental disorder. Upon learning of this, the Führer immediately ordered the arrest of his adjutant, as only his adjutant knew that Hess was traveling by plane. The adjutant did not prevent this action beforehand, nor did he report this violation of the Führer's orders afterward. The National Socialist Party deeply regrets this. If Comrade Hess has not been killed in a plane crash, he may have encountered other unfortunate events." (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

Berlin: According to a statement from the National Socialist Party, the documents left by Hess clearly prove that Hess fantasized about making personal contact with old friends in England in order to achieve Anglo-German friendship. News from London has confirmed that Hess was injured upon landing in Scotland at the location he wanted to visit. The party knows that Hess has been ill for several years and has recently been using various treatments. His actions have proven that he is suffering from delusions. Hess deeply understood Hitler's peace proposals. He mistakenly believed that by personal sacrifice, he could stop the development of the destruction of the British Empire. Hess's responsibilities were limited to party affairs. The documents he left behind do not have clear opinions explaining the path he took and the consequences of various steps, which can serve as clear proof. The National Socialist Party regrets that Hess fell into this delusion. There is absolutely no change in the continuation of the war that Germany was forced to participate in. Hitler declared in a recent speech that this war will continue until the current British authorities are overthrown or they are prepared for peace. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

Berlin: People in Berlin believe that Hess's sudden flight to Scotland is a result of years of illness. He has consulted many doctors, but has not recovered his health, and his condition has recently worsened. Hess served as an air force officer during the last World War and suffered lung injuries. Later, he suffered from increasingly severe stomach problems and insomnia and mental disorders. Famous doctors were helpless. Although he lived a very peaceful lifestyle, he was unable to reduce the progression of his illness. Hitler has been concerned about this. He appointed Hess as a party representative eight years ago and has gradually reduced his responsibilities. His appointment of General Göring as his successor at the outbreak of the European War can serve as clear proof. According to well-informed sources in the National Socialist Party, Hess's duties have recently been reduced as much as possible due to health reasons. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

### Hitler Meets Darlan: Preliminary Negotiations Completed on Political and Economic Cooperation

Berlin: According to responsible sources here, Führer Hitler met with French Associate Darlan yesterday in the presence of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

Vichy: The meeting between the French Deputy Prime Minister and the highest German political figures at a certain location at the end of last week is considered by informed sources to be a preliminary step in German-French political and economic cooperation. Germany and France are negotiating for France to take on an important role in establishing Hitler's "New Europe" and to turn Africa into a huge raw material warehouse for Europe, developing and supplying Europe as much as possible. (United Press, 13th)

### Change of Name for the Party Representative Office: Hitler Personally Serves as President

Berlin: The German National Socialist Party issued an official gazette yesterday, announcing that Führer Hitler had taken over the office of Party Representative Hess. The content of the gazette is as follows: "The Party Representative Office will now be renamed 'National Socialist Party President's Office.' The President will be assumed by myself. Bormann will serve as the Secretary-General of the President's Office." Signed, Hitler, May 12, 1941. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

Berlin: Hitler has ordered the arrest of Hess's subordinates. Hitler had previously forbidden Hess from using airplanes, but the Nazi third leader still stole a plane and left a note for the doctor. Hitler's order to arrest Hess's staff stated, "These members did not prevent Hess from flying privately beforehand, nor did they report it afterward." Hess recently appeared in public during the German parliamentary assembly on Sunday when Hitler gave a speech reporting on the Balkan campaign. When the meeting opened, Hess followed Hitler and Göring from the cloakroom into the hall, wearing a brown ritual uniform. Hess sat next to Hitler during his speech. Hess's most recent speech was on May 1st at the Augsburg metal factory, praising German industrial giants and awarding newsreel commendations. (United Press, 13th)

### The German Führer Deserted by His Inner Circle: Londoners Both Shocked and Delighted

London: British diplomatic commentators are commenting on the unprecedented and peculiar situation faced by Britain, namely the arrival of the German Deputy Führer Hess, Hitler's most trusted confidant and who knows all of Germany's war plans. Commentators are speculating on Hess's motives for flying to Glasgow, generally believing that Hess's move may indicate a serious rift in the Nazi Party and unanimously asserting that Hess fled for his life. Officials are maintaining silence about Hess's conversation with the current military attaché to the Foreign Office, former First Secretary of the British Embassy in Germany, Mr. Kirkpatrick. However, some political experts believe that British Prime Minister Churchill may make a statement. British political experts believe that Hess's escape will cause an astonishing reaction in Germany, as Hess is generally recognized by the Germans as one of the Führer's most trusted personnel. These experts find it laughable that the Germans consider Hess a madman, pointing out that Hess attended the last German parliament meeting and sat side by side with Hitler. It is also said that Hess was ordered by Hitler to go to Madrid last week. The British Broadcasting Corporation has been broadcasting the news to the German and Italian people that Hess has defected to correct the German official version that Hess died after jumping from an airplane. The British news was broadcast to the two countries this morning and is scheduled to be repeated all day today. Mr. Bruce, a foreign affairs reporter for the "Daily Mail" who knew the Nazi leaders quite well before the war, believes that a violent conflict has occurred within the Nazi Party. Because Hess feared that he would encounter the same disaster as some of Hitler's confidants in the 1934 purge, he fled for his life. Mr. Bruce also said that Hess must be dissatisfied with his colleagues' ambition to conquer the world, so he did this. He also said that the leaders of the Third Reich's army, navy, and air force must remember that Hess knows everything about Germany. This escape must have led to a complete divulging of secrets and that these people may only be frustrated at this time. As for Hitler being abandoned by his most trusted person, he must also be greatly disappointed. If Hess has betrayed him, then who else can he trust? The "Daily Telegraph," in commenting on the German official statements, said that judging from the wording of this peculiar statement, the Nazi Party knew that Hess had escaped by taking advantage of a convenience that these people could not control and hoped that no one would believe any statements made by Hess that were unfavorable to these people. Therefore, they asserted that Hess was mentally disordered. This German statement may indicate that there is a party split in Germany, and it can be seen that the situation in Nazi Germany is not good everywhere. Other commentators in the press believe that the Germans' claim that Hess is crazy is because Hitler is deeply afraid that Hess will tell Britain the most important German information. The News Federation ridiculed the German news that Hess was crazy, saying that Hess apparently chose an airplane that did not have enough gasoline to send him back. This plane needed to be driven by someone with special skills who could drive an extremely fast plane, and a mentally ill person could not drive such a plane to reach a specific location. Aviation experts, commenting on Hess's flight, said that Hess must have found it very difficult to use even a non-electric compass to navigate this plane, because a single aviator could not use a compass. Hess may have chosen a more northerly route to avoid London's air defenses and the German airfields in French territory where German bombers are ready to depart at any time. The route Hess followed was easy to navigate with a map and compass. British people were shocked and delighted to hear the news broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation at midnight. Later, they saw the early newspapers carrying this news with large headlines such as "German Deputy Führer Quits," "Hitler's Deputy Flees Germany," "Hess Arrives in Scotland," and "Hitler's Deputy Hess Captured in Glasgow." (United Press, 13th)

### Secrets of the Nazi Interior Revealed: Washington Closely Watching Its Development

The "New York Times" recently published an article discussing the flight of the German Deputy Führer Hess to Central England, stating that Hess's move, on the surface, is purely a fact of escape. Hess's move is not to save his own life, but a reaction in the party or the country that made him risk going to England. Regardless of the reason for this nominally Nazi leader's trip to England, there will be a huge reaction in Germany. This is a fact that is enough to affect the overall situation of the war. It is not difficult to imagine the impact on Hitler, as Hess is Hitler's "shadow" and the closest person to the German Führer among the Nazi Party leaders. Who can know the dark secrets, hidden tensions, and deep jealousy between the Nazi Party leaders? Who can know the truth behind Germany's engagement in this war, and why? This special film is an interlude performed in the amazing play performed by the entire Nazi Party. (United Press, 13th)

Editorial

### Comparative Observation of US and Soviet Attitudes

The "non-participation in the war" of the United States and the "peace policy" of the Soviet Union have kept them outside the vortex of war for several years. But the price they have paid separately is already very high. For example, the United States watched France fall last year, and the Soviet Union endured the German and Italian sweep of the Balkans. Even now, they are still being drawn to the edge of the war. Whether they can ultimately avoid being drawn into the vortex is a huge question that shrouds the hearts of people all over the world.

Although the various measures taken by the United States in recent months have not abandoned the principle of "non-participation in the war" in principle, the objective facts are not the same. The question is whether the participation in the war of materials will progress to positive military action. As for the Soviet Union, although it has not abandoned its proclaimed "peace policy" and is striving for domestic construction, it is also promoting national mobilization and preparation at the same time. Its current problem is whether it will further compromise with Germany and Italy in the Near East or whether it will resist the German and Italian extension into the Near East and Turkey. No matter which of these two possibilities is taken, the reality is that they are drawing into war.

Regarding the question of US participation in the war, based only on the situation of Germany and Italy, the United States does not seem to have any direct need to take action now; and the German and Italian army, navy, and air force are in fact far away across the ocean and cannot start a war with the United States. Based on the situation in Japan, the United States has no need to take positive military action unless it is attacked or Japan attacks Britain. After examining the various measures taken by Germany, Italy, and Japan in recent months, there are no signs on the surface that they are prepared to go to war with the United States immediately. Even if the United States provides more large-scale assistance to Britain and engages in protection and transportation, it is difficult to imagine that Germany and Italy will have any serious reaction immediately. It must be known that the focus of the current problem is still on the Soviet Union, and the United States is only trying to cope, which is in a passive position. Why is this said? If there is indeed another compromise between the Soviet Union and Germany in the works, attempting to divide the Near East, then the land defense of the British Empire, even if only to deal with Germany, would require the United States to provide assistance with manpower, let alone the Soviet Union participating in the invasion group! At that time, for the sake of the overall situation of the world and for the sake of its own future security, the United States would of course have to take major action and go to war. Therefore, for the sake of the United States, even if it is difficult for itself and the Soviet Union to work together, at least it should prevent the Soviet Union from cooperating with Germany and Italy at a considerable price. The so-called price is only war! On the other hand, there are many disagreements in the current rumors of Soviet-German compromise on the Near East. Based on common sense, it is difficult to quickly believe that the Soviet Union would take such a self-binding action, putting itself in an unprecedented crisis. If Germany and Italy extend their power into the Near East, the Soviet Union will inevitably lose an ally in Turkey. As for how to get along well with Germany, Italy, and Japan afterwards, it will become a problem at any time and in any place. It is better to take a strong stand and resist the German and Italian involvement in the Near East, then in today's international situation, it can only stand on the same front as countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Turkey.

Leaving the purely self-interested point of view, what people cannot help but think about is the issue of standing and principles. There are clearly many irreconcilable contradictions between the aggressor countries Germany, Italy, and Japan; however, their mutually echoing acts of aggression are at least built on one point of agreement, which is to oppose the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Several years ago, the Soviet Union put forward the slogan of opposing aggression, hoping to unite all the remaining countries to resist the advance of violence. The unfortunate failure of this movement at that time should of course be attributed to the short-sightedness and prejudice of the rulers of the United Kingdom and France. Even now, at this critical moment, facing the fierce edge of the aggressive forces, the few major anti-aggressive countries that remain in the world are still unable to achieve consensus, which is very painful. Because of the different national systems between these countries, there are various contradictions, but these contradictions, compared to the current common crisis and the resulting crisis for the future of all mankind, then the so-called contradictions are really nothing. And if the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union cannot cooperate one day, the world's forces of justice will not be able to unite for one day, and the fierce flames of the aggressive forces will not be able to be suppressed for one day, giving it the opportunity to defeat them one by one. This is obvious, and probably most people in the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries can clearly recognize it. If the forces of justice can ultimately be united and human civilization will ultimately trend towards prosperity, then now is the most urgent time for the rulers of each country to suppress prejudice and seek cooperation!

### The German Incident is Like a Bolt from the Blue: Rome and Tokyo Greatly Shaken

Rome: After the disappearance of German National Socialist Party Deputy Leader Hess, political figures here are quite shaken. Hess has visited Italy several times and has many friends in Italy. Although they knew that he was ill, they did not expect his ending to be so tragic. After the news spread here, important Italian figures flocked to the German Embassy to inquire about the news. The media here were too late to receive the news and did not have time to publish it. (Havas, 13th)

Tokyo: Former Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Kurusu, had a personal friendship with Hess and expressed great surprise at the news of Hess's flight to England, saying that he did not understand why Hess had done this at all. It is said that Hess was very pro-Japanese, and when they met last November, there was no sign of mental abnormality. Sources in Japan said that Hess's move before the implementation of a blitzkrieg against Britain should not have any political impact, because Berlin said that he was mentally disordered. (Reuters, 13th)

### Hess Lands in Scotland: Immediately Seeks to Meet the Duke of Hamilton

Glasgow: Hess carried his own medicines with him on Saturday night. Because the gasoline ran out, Hess jumped out of the plane. It was only a few seconds before the plane crashed and was destroyed. There was no one else in the plane, and there were no bombs or explosives in the plane. A hospital examination of Hess's body revealed that his heart was weak and he had a bladder disease, so he carried his own medicines. Hess took off from Augsburg at 6:30 PM and arrived in western Scotland five hours later. (United Press, 13th)

London: Those in the know who have compared the texts of the British and German announcements both believe that this matter was planned in advance and was not an accidental landing. Hess's landing site was on the estate of the Duke of Hamilton in Strathaven. Hess apparently knew where it was because he immediately asked others to introduce him to the Duke of Hamilton. The Duke is the former Marquess of Clydesdale and flew over Mount Everest in 1933. He has not been involved in peace movements recently. (United Press, 13th)

### Suspected German Paratrooper Descends from the Sky: Farmer Details Discovery

Glasgow - Deputy Führer of Germany, Hess, who intentionally landed here on Saturday night, was first discovered by a farmer named MacYun. Today, MacYun told reporters from the Associated Press about his capture of Hess. MacYun heard the sound of a plane crashing in his house and rushed out to investigate. He saw Hess rolling on the ground, trying to free himself from his parachute. Hess seemed to have no other injuries except for his ankle. He carried many photographs and documents proving his identity. Soon, the police arrived at MacYun's farmhouse, took the documents, and then notified the Foreign Office. Hess was then sent to the hospital, where it was verified that Hess's ankle was fractured, and he had heart and bladder problems. He also brought medicine from Germany to treat these conditions. MacYun told the Associated Press reporter, "At that time, I was outside. I heard the plane flying overhead, and everyone else had gone to bed. Then a plane crashed in the field. When I ran over, I saw the plane was on fire. When I saw a parachute falling in the darkness, I was quite alarmed. I looked up and saw a man descending slowly with the parachute. I immediately determined that the person was a German airman. I went back to the house for help, but they were all asleep. In my haste, I looked around for a weapon, but there was nothing except a weed. Because I was afraid of losing the airman, I rushed back alone. I saw a person lying on the ground with a collapsed parachute. He smiled at me, and I helped him up. He thanked me. I saw that his foot was injured, so I helped him into the house. At this time, my mother and sister had gotten up and were making tea, but he didn't want to drink tea. We told him that we in this country are very fond of tea. He smiled and said, 'I never drink tea so late at night. I only need a glass of water.' We immediately notified the military authorities. At the same time, the German started casually chatting with us and showed us photos of his young son, speaking with great pride. He said he had left Germany four hours ago and landed because it was getting dark. From his manner of speaking, I knew that he was an educated person. Although he had a foreign accent, his English was very clear. He completely understood what we were saying. He was tall and burly, over six feet tall, and wore a beautiful flight suit. His watch and the bracelet engraved with his name were both made of gold. He did not mention the details of his flight, but he seemed to find this flight, which we thought was dangerous, quite amusing. He seemed confident that he would be treated well and repeatedly expressed his happiness that he landed safely. He was very polite to my mother and sister, bowing when entering and leaving. He thanked us deeply, but he was very concerned about his parachute. He said to me, 'I want to save this parachute because my life is entirely dependent on this parachute.' He would not tell us who he was, and we didn't want to ask too much, because we thought he was just a paratrooper who had been shot down. When the officers arrived, he greeted them with a smile and said that he had no weapons and raised his hands to be searched. Then the officers took him away. From his clothes, gold watch, etc., we knew that he was an important person. His leather boots were also very beautiful, as fine as his gloves," he said. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

### The United States Ignores Japan's Peace Offensive: Fleet Remains in the Pacific: Australian Prime Minister Consults with Roosevelt on Joint Defense Against Japan's Ambition to Advance Southward

Washington - It is believed here yesterday that the new peace offensive in the Sino-Japanese war is yet another attempt to make the United States keep its fleet stationed in the Pacific, regardless of the situation in the Atlantic. Observers believe that the peace rumors may have originated in Washington, but most of them came from Tokyo. The spread of these rumors is intended to probe what naval policy Italy will adopt if Japan actually advances southward. It is widely believed that President Roosevelt discussed the situation with Australian Prime Minister Menzies yesterday, and Menzies also discussed with many State Department officials, possibly even discussing US-Australian cooperation to deal with any Japanese action in the South Pacific. Informed sources said that the proposal for a truce in the Sino-Japanese war has not been taken seriously here but is considered an attempt to scare the United States into fearing that the Japanese army, once free from the war in China, may seize the Dutch East Indies. It is also believed here that the suggestion for Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke to visit Washington has not been supported by responsible parties. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

The United States Will Never Tolerate Japan

Washington - Today, American newspapers criticized Japan's intention to make peace with China so that it could shift its troops in China for other purposes, but Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is unwilling to accept any mediation except by the United States. The Scripps newspapers published Simms's argument, saying that it can be asserted that unless Japan first agrees to discuss peace based on the Nine-Power Treaty, there is absolutely no possibility that the United States will accept the position of mediator. For strategic and principal reasons, the United States will never create a peace of temporary expediency that will harm the future for China. The New York Times editorial said that Japan has been fighting in China for more than four years and has not conquered China, but has consumed much of its own resources and sacrificed the world's goodwill toward Japan. Although it has Chinese land, it has not benefited economically, and the troops it must maintain in China are hurting its domestic economy. Now it sees richer treasures elsewhere and wants to free its troops to seize them. Japan is like a naughty child stealing candy, already taking a handful of candy from one jar, but wanting to steal more coveted candy from another jar, but it cannot get it without letting go of what it already holds. It is heard that the United States is not only not prepared to mediate in Far Eastern affairs, but according to news here today, will further assist China and help establish a base in Burma to protect the Burma Road, so that supplies can be smoothly delivered to the Chinese interior for the use of the Chinese army. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Washington - Australian Prime Minister Menzies told reporters after visiting President Roosevelt in bed yesterday for an hour, "We talked about almost everything." The Australian ambassador to the United States said that they talked about the past, present, and future. Menzies did not bring a letter from British Prime Minister Churchill to the US President but said he was conveying the British Prime Minister's regards. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Washington - According to the White House, President Roosevelt's health is gradually improving. Although still weak due to recent abdominal illness, he was able to meet Prime Minister Menzies yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Australia Attaches Great Importance to Singapore's Security

Washington - When Australian Prime Minister Menzies hosted a banquet at the National Press Club yesterday, someone asked about Australia's attitude toward maintaining the status quo in the Pacific. Menzies replied that Australia considers Singapore extremely important, practically the key to the Pacific defense for freedom-loving people. Australia's policy will depend on the attitude of other countries towards Singapore and Australia. Australia should first try its best to consolidate its own defense and then defend Singapore, the most important hub in the Pacific. Australia has already sent troops and aircraft to support Singapore. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### Fighting Intensifies on the Jin-Yu Border: Chinese Army Crosses the River to Launch a Fierce Attack: Japanese Continue to Invade Northwest of Jiyuan: Fierce Battles Unfold on the North Bank of the Yellow River

Chongqing - Fighting on the Jin-Yu border is intensifying. Japanese troops invading Jiaji continue to invade northwest towards Fengmenkou, Xichengliu, and other places, continuing to engage in fierce battles with the Chinese army. Fierce battles are taking place on the mountains from the northwest of Yuanqu to the foothills of the Zhongtiao Mountains east of Xia County. Wangmaozhen and other places north of Yuanqu are still in bloody battles. In order to thoroughly prevent the Japanese army from crossing the river and invading, the Huadong authorities have transferred a large army from Tongguan and Luoyang to cross the Yellow River and go north to the front line to participate in the war. The fighting on the north bank of the Yellow River is gradually becoming fierce. (Telegraph, 12th)

Chongqing - Military sources say that the Japanese army clearly intends to encircle and eliminate the Chinese army based in the strategically important Zhongtiao Mountains. However, recent news arriving in Chongqing has led military observers to doubt whether a major offensive has already begun. According to intelligence, although the Japanese troops in Shanxi have increased by at least one division, and many have been moved from the north to the south, no additional troops have been sent to China. Therefore, from an overall perspective, there is no major concentration in the Yellow River region or the Pinghan Road area. Therefore, the number of Japanese troops is not sufficient to conduct a major battle. It is speculated here that the current offensive in southern Shanxi may be of a preparatory nature, preparing for a major offensive when more troops are obtained. At the same time, military intelligence says that the Japanese column that started a northward attack from Jingmen in central Hubei was driven back yesterday, with 2,000 killed or wounded. Military intelligence also says that the Japanese army has divided into three routes to attack Huizhou in eastern Guangdong, with the main column totaling 10,000 people. Fierce fighting continues in Boluo County. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

Chongqing - Front-line war reports received in Chongqing today state that the Japanese are currently launching offensives in southern Shanxi, northern Henan, northern Hubei, and Guangdong Province simultaneously, on a scale not seen since the Battle of Wuhan. Southern Shanxi and northern Hubei are particularly noteworthy, as it appears that their goal is to seize Xi'an and Hanzhong and cut off traffic between Sichuan Province and the Northeast. According to Chinese military authorities, the Japanese are currently using divisions transferred from Manchuria to fight in southern Shanxi. So far, the division numbers of three divisions have been discovered. It is also heard that the Japanese on the front lines of Hubei and Fujian provinces have concentrated a force of seven divisions. The war in Guangdong Province is taking place near Boluo on the East River. All sectors of the Chinese public are paying close attention to the recent statements by Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and Minister Tojo that the Japanese army intends to resolve the China Incident with all its strength. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Kunming - Fifteen Japanese planes attacked Kunming at 11:00 this morning, dropping bombs in the residential area north of the city. The air defense forces fiercely fired on them, so many bombs deviated and fell into the lake. The National Yunnan University was heavily damaged by bombs. (Telegraph, 12th)

Carp in the Jialing River Suffer

Chongqing - On the 9th and 10th of this month, Japanese planes suddenly attacked Chongqing, and many bombs fell into the Jialing River. Thousands of fresh fish were blown ashore, mostly carp. The largest weighed 47 pounds. The boatmen were overjoyed and immediately transported them to the market to sell, at four yuan per fish, half the usual price, and they were immediately sold out. Here, carp is regarded as a delicacy and is only prepared for grand banquets. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

The Burma Road Was Not Damaged

Chongqing - A certain American newspaper recently published news that the Burma Road was bombed by Japanese planes and severely damaged. This statement was solemnly denied by Peng Xuepei, Deputy Minister of the Chinese Ministry of Communications. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

Cairo - Military circles in Cairo claimed that although the Western Desert is unbearably hot, the British troops there still maintain the initiative, constantly attacking and achieving satisfactory results.

The battle situation around Amba Alagi in Abyssinia can be described as satisfactory.

### American Female Writer, Ms. Clare Boothe, Talks About Creative Experience

— Yu Zhen

Recently, American writers have been coming to China for research one after another. The famous playwright Ms. Clare Boothe recently visited Chongqing with her husband, Henry Luce (editor of American magazines such as "Time" and "Fortune"). This is a fragment of Ms. Boothe's talk published in the New York Times, which is translated as follows:

"I don't like most people, and I have very few close friends in my life," Ms. Boothe began.

It was about five o'clock in the afternoon when she asked the servant for a pot of boiling water, a lemon, and a small knife. She cut the lemon, squeezed the juice into the boiling water, and then drank it. Ms. Boothe then talked about how she unintentionally wrote the sensational play "The Women."

"One night," she said, "Henry and I went to a nightclub. I went into the women's room alone, and he waited outside the door for a full hour and a half. When I came out, he asked me what I was doing inside. I said I was chatting with the girls. He asked what we were talking about. I didn't expect him to notice women's affairs for the first time. He was an extremely curious man; if something didn't arouse his interest, it was fine, but if it stirred his curiosity, he wouldn't let it go. So I thought I would briefly tell him what we had just talked about. I didn't expect that once I started thinking, I was surprised to find that all we talked about was gossiping.

"We traveled to White Sulphur over the weekend. As soon as we arrived, he was called back to the company. At this time, I was still thinking about the women in the women's room and their secrets. I felt really bored being left alone here. Involuntarily, I picked up paper and pen and pieced together these fragments on the card table, making them each tell their own stories. I wrote for three consecutive days, following the simple story. After three days, the script for "The Women" was born."

Boothe is accustomed to writing with a fountain pen and ink, and she writes very quickly. She has a habit of rereading while writing. If she used a typewriter instead of a pen, she would always reread the last few lines and stop there. She doesn't cherish her original manuscript. When the theater owner asked her to modify a few small sections in the original script, she didn't hesitate to rewrite the entire play, but she had to do it herself and didn't allow others to do it for her. She uses this method to protect her copyright. She said she would rather write books because books express her own thoughts and no one would dare to make presumptuous suggestions.

She is a writer who stays up late, but she has changed her mind since her second marriage. Because her husband is busy all day and only has time to rest at night, if she works at night, the couple will never see each other. In order to concentrate on writing, she often shuts herself in a room and refuses all social engagements. In New York, she often disconnects the phone, and in Greenwich Village, she often pretends to have gone out to play golf, swim, boat, or do other entertainment.

Generally, people who write scripts often spend a lot of time thinking about the plot, but she doesn't pay much attention to it. She said, "In the script 'Kiss the Boys Goodbye', I killed off the male protagonist twice, thinking the layout was extremely novel. Before long, I realized that this was just the old trick of detective novelists. So now I write whatever comes to mind and no longer pretend. The latest work I started is, in terms of its basic plot, almost the same as the story of Tristan and Isolde (a medieval love tragedy)."

Ms. Boothe claims that she knew in her childhood that she would either become an actress or a playwright. For a period of time, she performed on stage, but she performed terribly and knew she had no hope. Later, she got married, and for several years, she mixed with a group of people who had nothing to do with books and writing, and was almost assimilated by them. But after her divorce, her only thought was to write for a magazine and find a job that would make her stand out.

She wrote three scripts, all of which were aborted. Then she wrote "Abide With Me," which tells the story of a young woman who marries a drunkard and is scouted by Broadway. "The Women," written in 1936, was not initially appreciated by critics, but it eventually caused a sensation and established her position. Two years later, she published "Kiss the Boys Goodbye," which was also severely criticized, but ultimately achieved considerable success. The last one she wrote, "Kiss the Boys Goodbye," was slightly inferior.

Boothe's recent work, "Europe in the Spring," combines facts and theory, and is the crystallization of her travels in Europe on the eve of the outbreak of the European war. In February 1939, she went to Europe as a journalist, traveling to France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United Kingdom. At this time, the situation in Europe was changing drastically, and she gained a lot of insight wherever she went. In June, she returned to New York and wrote a 10,000-word essay about her experiences, which she sent to her husband Luce, the editor of Life magazine. Later, she felt that she had more to say than in the essay, so she retreated to the countryside, worked hard, and completed the entire manuscript in six weeks, naming it "Europe in the Spring."

After the book was published, its appeal and sales were unprecedented compared to her previous plays. She purely used an American perspective to analyze the ills of Europe and used the techniques of writing plays to develop insightful theories, making it fascinating. This is another new creative experience for her.

Ms. Boothe is now in Chongqing.

### US Export Certification System to be Extended to the Philippines to Prevent Military Supplies and Raw Materials from Flowing into Japan for its Aggression; Secretary of the Navy Announces Need to Ensure US Goods Arrive Safely in Britain

Washington: The House Military Affairs Committee yesterday unanimously passed the State Department's bill to prevent military supplies from leaking from the Philippines to Japan.

Washington: Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox delivered a speech at the National Defense Engineers Association last night, stating that the United States must choose from the following three paths: 1. to confront the aggressors with strength; 2. to completely isolate itself; 3. to willingly submit. I believe that we are forced to take the first path, which is to deter or defeat the aggressors with strength. As for the convoy method, I believe that this method may not be sufficient to solve the current problem. Therefore, we may need to implement a new national defense system to ensure that our goods can arrive safely in Britain. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)

### National Thrift Movement Achieves Satisfactory Results; Second Phase of Work Progresses in an Orderly Manner; Quota for April is 300 Million

Chongqing: Since the national thrift and nation-building savings movement concluded the first phase of the competition on January 28, in order to take into account the development of other movements, we have temporarily avoided superficial activities. However, the second phase of work has progressed in an orderly manner, and the increase in numbers has been able to meet the predetermined goals. According to the reports received by the savings promotion association from various branches at the end of April, the total amount of savings coupons is close to 300 million yuan, which shows that the upward trend of our country's savings movement has created a situation of taking advantage of the situation, and the future is promising. In addition, the recent policy of the savings promotion association focuses on practicing thrift to open up sources of savings and generally promoting the purchase of small-denomination savings coupons, with the aim of being lasting. Enthusiastic people with savings capacity in various places continue to participate in large numbers. For example, Dai Enchao from Suixi County, Guangdong, purchased savings coupons worth 470,000 yuan as an example. Tan Bingcheng's family in Kaixian, Sichuan, is only of middle-class background, but when the Dongchuan Post Office sent personnel to promote the campaign, they also purchased coupons worth 10,000 yuan to help the investment in the cause of nation-building. Among the institutions, schools, and organizations that used funds to purchase savings coupons, the Guangzhou Bay Yizhi Middle School's 700,000 yuan was the most. (Dispatch of the 13th)

### Food: Shanghai Municipal Council Publicly Sells Rice; First Batch Has Arrived; Only Over 30,000 Bags; Rice Merchants Think of Stirring Up Trouble Again

The foreign rice purchased by the Concession authorities arrived in port the day before yesterday (the 11th). Jardine Matheson's "Mingsheng" vessel brought 22,500 bags, and Butterfield & Swire's "Hanyang" vessel brought 9,696 bags, totaling 31,196 bags. It is heard that the second batch may also arrive in Shanghai this week. In addition to the foreign rice, the "Hanyang" vessel also brought 3,423 bags of corn. (Concession)

The price of foreign rice fell in the morning yesterday but rose at noon, and the market stabilized later. As a result, although it was still a little lower than the noon closing price of the day before yesterday, it was slightly higher than the evening closing price of the day before yesterday. However, according to the observation of people in the industry, the price of rice has fallen sharply by more than 30 yuan, and it can now enter a consolidation phase. It is difficult to expect the market price to improve, but major ups and downs may have to wait until after the Dragon Boat Festival. At that time, Hong Kong rice and Vietnamese rice will be able to arrive in port one after another, and the movements of sales, the amount of inventory, and the high and low production prices will all affect the rise and fall of the rice market. When the market opened yesterday morning, because Hong Kong rice had already been unloaded and was waiting for sale, and the French authorities had announced the loading of 20,000 tons of Vietnamese rice, and because of the weak wind of the day before yesterday, the prices of various foreign rice fell sharply by 3-4 yuan. The lowest price of small glutinous rice spot was 113 yuan, and Saigon No. 1 was 123 yuan. After the price fell, the cargo owner refused to sell again, and the real buyers also took advantage of the low price to add to their purchases, and said that the newly arrived Hong Kong rice still had to go through customs clearance procedures before it could be sold publicly. Therefore, the buying sentiment turned active, and the price of each rice market immediately recovered by 4-5 yuan. The closing price of small glutinous rice rose to 118 yuan, and Saigon No. 1 rose to 125.5 yuan.

The original package of English China Steamship (one stone and two dou and a half) also rose from low to high. Saigon No. 1 was from 141 yuan to 143-4 yuan, and broken rice was from 111 yuan to 112.5 yuan. The transaction volume of English China Steamship was more than 600 tons, and the spot rice was 14-15,000 bags.

The road for thick and thin japonica rice and glutinous rice is still limited. Fortunately, the market is also rare, and the cargo owners are unwilling to sell lightly. Under persistence, it continues to present a fixed situation. Xijing is still 138 yuan, Wujing is 136 yuan second to 133 yuan, and Nangang early and late rice is 133.5 yuan second to 132 yuan. As for Hong Kong Baiyuan, it opened at 115.5 yuan and 117 yuan.

### Flour Market Initially Weak, Then Stable

The flour market was initially weak but then stabilized. At the opening of the morning market, foreign flour fell with the price of rice, and more than 200,000 bags of fixed flour were read, and people's hearts were not encouraged, so the market price fell. Jinlong brand Kanfen only opened at 30 yuan 05-6 cents, Huabiao brand at 30 yuan 09 cents, Zhonglou brand at 31 yuan, and foreign fort flour at 31 yuan. The rate of decline can also be said to be rapid. However, it was heard later that the gold market rose sharply and the price of rice recovered slightly. Buyers who took advantage of the low price to buy gradually became numerous. For a time, the buying sentiment turned strong, and the selling price of each commodity was 2-3-4 cents higher than the previous market.

The transaction of wheat yesterday was as light as usual. The source of inland China has been dry for a long time, and the stock of goods in the concession is also very few. In the midst of the shutdown of each factory, there was no new transaction of wheat. It is heard that the Japanese factory slightly increased its intake at the retail market, and the price was 46-7 yuan, which was also a loose drop of 1-2 yuan compared to the previous market.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Soybeans Apparently Decline, But Secretly Rise

Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes did not have any special changes. The price of corn continued to fall, with more than 3,000 bags of spot goods and 200 tons of futures being traded. The price of Saigon old goods was 31 yuan (outside warehouse), and the price of new goods was 31 yuan 3.5 cents to 32 yuan. The price of English China Steamship was 60 yuan to 59 yuan (bank warehouse), the price of Dutch white corn was 34 yuan to 33 yuan 2 cents, and the price for delivery from the end of April to the beginning of May was 62 yuan. The price of yellow corn was 34 yuan 2 cents to 34 yuan 8 cents (bank warehouse). The price of yellow soybeans apparently declined, but secretly rose. Although the sales of oil mills were not smooth, they continued continuously, and the potential was quite tight. Yesterday, more than 3,000 bags of Guidet beans were opened, and the price was 45 yuan to 45 yuan 8 cents. This street sold 300 bags of Tianjin beans, and the price was 48 yuan to 48 yuan 3 cents. The price of 200 bags of Tianjin green beans was 46 yuan.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Rises Again to Cover Shorts

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices were flat for all exchanges. The black market for British and American exchange rates turned soft while being stable. Speculators came to cover shorts at the opening in the morning. Importers had huge amounts of foreign rice to settle, and they were fortunate to have a sale to a certain American bank, which was tight but slight. Near noon, it was suddenly heard that American warships had postponed the news of the convoy, and Chinese banks and speculators rose to cover shorts. At noon, the remaining price rose to the 6,500 yuan mark again, and the trend was sharper. The settlement of US exchange rates was 5 yuan 34375, and the British exchange rates followed tightly to three offices 28125. In the afternoon, the supply intention of foreign banks was slightly better, and the pulling power of speculation weakened. Although the price of gold stepped up, the noon market stabilized. The final central gold was three offices 28125, tight 03125, and US gold was five yuan 34375, tight 0625. Transactions were not rare.

The settlement of foreign rice was also huge.

Since the morning foreign telegraphic silver market, British, American, and Indian have unanimously not changed. The US exchange rate rose by nine points against Shanghai, while the rest were flat. The central listed prices were flat for all exchanges in the early opening of the domestic market. The bank's selling price for spot goods was flat. British exchange rates were three offices 3125, and US gold was five yuan 406825. After the opening, it immediately softened to the point where it was difficult to settle at the above prices. The speculator did not obtain the five yuan 40625 of this month's pull. HSBC's listed prices changed more for each exchange rate. After the silver balance tax was still levied at 24.50%, the British Bank had a slight supply, and the situation tended to stabilize for a long time. Until after 10:30, an importing rice firm came to pull this month's US gold five yuan 375, and the price of gold stepped up. A Chinese bank also came to cover shorts, pulling into the May period. Speculators also absorbed from it, and all pulled into this month and next month's US exchange rates of five yuan 375 and 34375. At the closing of the noon market, US gold was five yuan 34375, and the British exchange rate followed tightly to three offices 28125.

The bank still has supply.

In the afternoon, although the price of gold rose slightly to stop, the speculators pulled less of the five or six months of US gold five yuan 34375, and the bank was still willing to supply it, so they stopped pulling. The market trend became sluggish until the evening closing at 4 o'clock. From spot goods to the June period, the British exchange rate was three offices 28125, and US gold was five yuan 34375. Compared to the previous day's closing price, the British was tight 03125, and the US was tight 0625.

### Swap Already Arrived, Gold Market Returns to Rise

Yesterday's spot red black market in gold has risen back up. The price has already broken through the 6,500 yuan mark. People's hearts are strong because of today's swap. It is rumored that the exchange brokers and gold shops and four securities firms will knock on the big premium, requiring 50-60 yuan. In addition, it is widely rumored that the American warships have extended the news of the convoy, and the foreign exchange has already settled foreign rice. Chinese banks and speculators are covering shorts, which has led to a tighter trend. The short side is even more eager to cover. Securities firm Defu and exchange broker Dafeng added leverage and leaned in. Yida, Deda, Xinyuan, and Chengji followed the buying trend. The price gradually rose from 36,445 yuan in the morning to 6,520 yuan before the evening closing, finally rising by 101 yuan to 6,515 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 780,000 taels. The cash was first sold by Hesheng to Zhongxing for 50 taels, and the price was 220 yuan higher than the term delivery. Gold shop Chengji suddenly came to sell to Xinfengyong for 200 taels and Xianghe for 160 taels, pressing down to 200 yuan.

The increase of 70 yuan compared to the previous day, and the screen gold rose by 5 yuan, to 690 yuan. Customs gold was flat.

Spot Red Increased by More Than 100 Yuan

In the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened at 9:15 and immediately rose to 6,450 yuan, which was 36 yuan higher, as the price after the previous day's closing had already risen. Then it retreated slightly to 6,400,1000 yuan. Yida, Defu, Xinfengyong, and Decheng came to increase, rising to 6,470 yuan, sold by Tong Kangyong and Hengji. It is common to see a decline, retreating twice to 6,445 yuan. Around 10 o'clock, foreign exchange softened, and Chengda, Deda, Yida, and Defu tended to increase. The price rose to around 6,460 yuan, circling for a long time. When the good news was heard, exchange brokers Dafeng and Xinfengshui also increased sharply, and the rise suddenly accelerated, jumping out of the 6,500 yuan level, reaching 6,505 yuan. Chengji and Hengji sold out, and Deda sold again. Those who sold at a limited price retreated to 6,485 yuan, but Defu's increasing force did not stop, and it was again pushed to 6,907 yuan. The noon closing was 6,503 yuan, and after the closing it retreated to 6,499 yuan. Xinfengyong entered and raised it to 6,505 yuan. The 2 pm opening was 6,510 yuan, which was 7 yuan higher. Then it rose again to 6,515 yuan. Shunyuan and the silver firm helped to sell, and they immediately pressed down more than 30 yuan, retreating to 6,480 yuan, but people's hearts were upwards. Xinyuan, Defu, Dafeng, and Wanfeng absorbed one after another, and then raised 40 yuan, reaching 6,520 yuan. Xinfengyong sold until 6,505 yuan. The closing price at 4 o'clock was 6,515 yuan, which was 101 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. The settlement price for the May US gold five yuan 34375 was 6,516 yuan 96 cents, which was only 1 yuan 96 cents. After the closing, it dropped to 6,505 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 75 yuan throughout the day. The capital of the cash shop was sold at a price of 210 yuan higher than the spot red term delivery price, and the intake was 80 yuan lower than the sale. There is no price or market for the current bid gold.

Ornamental Gold Listed at 5 Yuan

The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was raised by 5 yuan by Datonghang and Xintonghang at 9:30 am, to 690 yuan (40 yuan was deducted for intake), it is said.

### Foreign Currency is Flat

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, although the price of spot red rose, the cash trended downward, so the British and American gold pounds, once they rose, immediately returned to flat. The British gold ticket suddenly fell by 2 yuan, and the American gold ticket revolved within a narrow range, and finally rose by 1 cent and 4 points. Hong Kong tickets tended to be firmer, and the evening market was as high as 4 yuan and 70 cents. The supply and demand of Japanese gold tickets were uniform, and the market price stabilized. The evening market was still 6 yuan and 8 points. Korean tickets followed the trend of softening, and the evening market retreated to 1 yuan and 78 points.

### Securities Stocks and Bonds: Bond Prices Can't Rise, Sellers Reluctant to Sell

Over-the-counter trading of government bonds yesterday saw a downturn in market conditions. The previous day's rise had been excessively inflated, so major institutional investors on the main floor weren't interested. Buying and selling were extremely sluggish. All the agents at the meetings were effectively stalled during meeting times. Various parties thought of raising prices, but were constantly pressured by short sellers. Sellers wanted to take profits at high prices, but it was difficult to find good prices. They held each other at bay, remaining in a stalemate. Although the bulls bore very heavy interest, they could still bear the pain to maintain it. Currently, Class A bonds are the cheapest, differing from Class C bonds by only eight dollars and seven cents. However, there are still few inquiries, indicating that people are very indifferent to this. The dull situation is feared to have no hope of unfolding temporarily. Yesterday morning, Lianyi bought at market prices, initially without falling. Because Hongda settled out and Runli also sold, Class C bonds initially broke through five yuan, then broke back inside the barrier. In the afternoon, Lianyi continued to buy, and Jiufeng and Shengxing also had needs. Lianhe bought Class B and sold Class C, and Xinfeng and Hengfu also had supplies. Class C bonds once again rushed out of five yuan, but the closing price was still inside the barrier, repeatedly hovering, making it difficult to predict future changes. Market prices ultimately eased uniformly by one and a half to three cents. Only sixty to seventy thousand yuan changed hands all day. A brief summary table is listed below.

Stock trading: 150 shares of Great China Match Company were traded, at a price of thirty-three yuan.

The trend of public enterprise stocks turned for the better, and prices rose quite a bit. The daily fluctuations were not large, and the volume was not very large. The closing sentiment was firm. Rubber stock trading was sparse.

London, 12th (Monday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds and Far East central business corporations remained flat, and the market generally remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Shuang Ma Profit-Taking Covers Shorts, Yesterday Already Rebounded and Rose, Actual Sales Still Unchanged

The yarn market, which had plummeted the previous day, rebounded yesterday. This was because the sharp decline in the past two days caused profit-takers to cover their positions, tightening the main floor. General speculators specialize in the trick of kicking a man when he's down. The more it rises, the more they buy; the more it falls, the more they sell. Therefore, the ups and downs of the market often exceed the norm. However, trading in spot yarn is still lackluster. The Hong Kong merchants only bought 230 bales of red Shuang Ma brand yarn in small lots of 10-count yarn. There were no other transactions. As for Japanese 10-count yarn, it only sells for 1,200 yuan. From this point of view, Shuang Ma prices are uniquely high. The fundamental problem is that if actual sales don't rise for a long time, the foundation for the future may be difficult to consolidate. 20-count Quan Nu yarn is priced at 1,290 yuan, and Shuang Diqiu is priced at 1,265 yuan. However, general institutional investors still hold tight. The future changes are difficult to predict. 20-count Shuang Ma yarn was priced at 1,461 yuan at the high end and 1,430 yuan at the low end. Initial trading in the afternoon rose to 1,465 yuan, but then eased to 1,447 yuan due to selling activity. The final price was 1,451 yuan and 2 cents. Moreover, people who speculate in the yarn market rely solely on margin increases and decreases to gamble. In short, this is not a fundamental solution. Today, 1,470 bales of cotton yarn are being shipped to Hong Kong.

Shuang Ma opened in the morning, with Tanfeng tightening, because profit-takers rushed to cover. The opening price was 1,435 yuan, but some was sold off, and it soon fell back to 1,430 yuan. However, most of the main floor players were scrambling for bull positions. As a result, the market hovered around 1,436 and 1,437 yuan for a long time. Later, it was heard that gold prices were good, rising to 1,444 yuan. After nearly 11:30, the atmosphere in the market tightened because foreign exchange slightly contracted, and speculative buyers were active, rising to 1,461 yuan. Profit-takers sold off, and it fell back to 1,450 yuan. The closing price was 1,456 yuan. The half-day turnover was 12,230 bales. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:

Hong Kong 230, Fellow Traders 12,000

Total 12,230

### Spot Cotton Demand Not Strong

The situation with spot cotton also feels sluggish and lacking in energy. Because factories have no way to sell their stored yarn, their interest in raw materials is very weak. As for fellow traders' thinking, they are still optimistic. However, cotton purchased by various parties in recent months has been arriving in a crowded manner, so inventory is much more abundant than before, and there is no great hope in the market. There were a total of 1,394 transactions in spot cotton, at a flat price.

Brazilian Cotton 401.0 Qingsheng 240 bales, warehouse delivery
Also 396.0 Maofeng 234 bales
Middling 416.0 Also 300 bales
Also 418.0 Also 125 bales
Also 418.0 Bingchang 200 bales
Brazilian Cotton 396.0 Also 300 bales

The New York cotton market softened due to Southern merchants buying on dips and bulls liquidating. As a result, closing prices were about 12 points lower than the previous day. The Indian cotton market was also flat, and trading was even more sparse. It initially fell due to speculative selling, but then rebounded due to buying support and broker purchases. Yesterday's closing prices, except for White Low's April and May contracts, which rose 5 rupees, rose or fell by about 1 rupee each. It is also predicted that the opening market today will be lower by 2 rupees.

Another message: Although the Shanghai foreign cotton market is gradually improving, with a slight turnaround in the market, because factories are not eating well and the international situation is swaying and uncertain, people are still taking a wait-and-see attitude and seem unwilling to purchase.

### Piece Goods: Factory Cloth Trends Stable

Factory cloth prices fell yesterday, then rebounded, and the trend gradually became stable. Fellow traders engaged in hedging transactions were in the majority, while actual sales to customers remained scarce. White goods, coarse cloth, and twill rose by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. Fine cloth was flat. Dyed cloth prices also stabilized. About 300 pieces of dyed cloth, coarse cloth, and twill were traded on this street. Hong Kong merchants continued to handle 70-80 pieces of twill and coarse cloth. Wholesale business to the mainland on this street is virtually non-existent because it is currently the busy farming season. On the 14th, 1,560 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

Dongbu, due to the rebound in leftover cotton yarn from the auction, short sellers covered their positions. Spot order for white goods, Longtou fine cloth, closing price in the after-market was 48 yuan and 45 cents. However, actual sales transactions were still as rare as stars at dawn. Colored goods, Four Gentlemen serge, opened in the morning at 1 yuan and 47 cents, falling to 1 yuan and 44 and a half cents. Then, because Shuang Ma yarn was reported to be rising, people were excited, and buyers suddenly emerged, gradually raising it to 1 yuan and 49 and a half cents. The closing price at noon was 1 yuan and 49 cents. Then, retail investors in the after-market began selling off again, opening at 1 yuan and 47 and a half cents. Finally, because the Exchange's yarn and cloth were slightly higher, it rose to 1 yuan and 48 cents and 75 cents at the close.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Sugar Fell Sharply

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to fall as hoarders sold off quite a bit. The association's listed price for spot 24 coarse white sugar was initially 113 yuan and a half, then fell to 13 yuan to 12 yuan and 7 cents, and finally only 11 yuan and a half, a drop of about 3 yuan. The May 20th contract for coarse white sugar was 113 yuan and 9 cents to 13 yuan in the morning, and 113 yuan and 4 cents to 12 yuan and 7 cents in the afternoon, a drop of 2 yuan and 3 cents. The end of May contract was 115 yuan and a half to 14 yuan and 2 cents in the morning, and 114 yuan and 7 cents to 13 yuan and 8 cents in the afternoon, a drop of 2 yuan and a half. Dutch red 29th year November arrival was 85 yuan, a drop of 2 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar B mark, West Warehouse, 114 yuan, Xiaoyuan half; East Warehouse, 113 yuan and a half to 12 yuan and 7 cents. DY mark's initial market was still 104 yuan, but there were no transactions later. HX mark, East Warehouse, fell to 100 yuan and 99 yuan and a half, Xiaosan yuan and a half. On the 13th, 555 bags of foreign sugar were imported from Hong Kong.

### Medicinal Materials: Medicinal Fox Nut Market Strong

Medicinal fox nuts had previously seen repeated increases due to small arrivals. Good quality white-skinned fox nuts rose to 124-125 yuan. The current market price has risen even further to 130 yuan. Red-skinned fox nuts were previously less than 100 yuan. Recently, several dozen bags have been released and reached 105 yuan. The market is strong.

### North-South Goods: Large Dried Longan Sells Well

— Grade One Goods Transferred to Cold Storage

Large sun-dried longan, previously due to a shortage of pressing and the steadfastness of merchants, had reached over 400 yuan. As a result, there have been successive arrivals. Although the number is not large, it has already exceeded demand. Recently, sales have become quiet, and prices have gradually eased. Grade one goods have been transferred to cold storage. Market prices have fallen by 30-40 yuan before and after.

### Silk and Tea: New Tea from Zhejiang Province Enters the Market

Recently, new teas from various parts of Zhejiang Province have been successively entering the market. Red and green teas from Tangqi, Liuxia, Luoshe, and other places are mostly shipped to Hangzhou for centralized sales. Tianjin merchants are searching for Longjing, Maofeng, and other goods in large quantities. The selling price of Longjing has recently been around 1,000 yuan per dan. Maofeng also requires 570-580 yuan. As for the new goods produced and sold by foreign firms, the production volume has decreased. Because factories in Shanghai are fully stocked, and Japanese merchants are also taking a wait-and-see approach due to high prices, general tea merchants are converting to baking green tea in order to seek export through stores, it is said.

### Coal: Bituminous Coal Sales Sluggish

The bituminous coal business has seen a significant decrease in sales in recent weeks due to sluggish sales to customers and factory needs halting. High costs are also a reason. Therefore, the over-the-counter market has gradually declined. Yesterday, Kailuan bituminous coal was 420 yuan per ton, screened lumps were 430 yuan, and coal dust was 340 yuan. The above prices are all fellow traders' line splits, delivered to customers with a small commission added. Compared to the previous market, prices have fallen by 10 yuan.

### Hardware: Weishi Iron Factory Sales Slightly Active

The hardware market has been quite quiet due to the sharp rise in prices of various goods and the lack of activity from merchants from other regions. Trading has felt quite depressed, nearly for a month. Since yesterday's market, the canning factories on this street have been searching for goods, and toy factories, printing factories, and other embellishments have also been seen from time to time. Therefore, actual sales are still stirring. However, merchants from the north road remain silent, and business from the Nanyang region is also sluggish. The entire market relies solely on sales on this street. People dare not be too optimistic. Opening prices are still quite firm. For example, old steel factory goods of 200 pounds per case are selling for 395 yuan, and new steel factory goods are opening around 385 yuan.

### Rubber (Continued)

— Gao Jiannong

Since the invention of vulcanized rubber and hard rubber, the need for rubber has greatly increased. People from various countries have been searching for the "plant cow" that can squeeze out milk juice all over the world, forming a period of "rubber fever." However, the rubber collected from various places is of poor quality, and some are exhausted and easy to break. The supply problem in the future really needs careful study. Therefore, the British Empire, which is always thinking about commerce, naturally cannot ignore this and plan countermeasures. In 1876 AD, the British government sent the famous botanists Wickham and Narkham to Brazil to investigate. They collected the seeds of the Hevea rubber tree. After returning to the country, they were planted in the very famous Kew Botanical Gardens on the right bank of the Thames River in London. The small rubber tree seedlings grew. They used a kind of portable greenhouse to protect the less than two hundred seedlings and transported them to the island of Ceylon with great care. Ten years later, with the help of the botanical garden, Singapore was also able to supply rubber tree seedlings to planters on the Malay Peninsula. Twenty-five years later, after many technical explorations and financial sacrifices, there were already 400,000 hectares of rubber forests on the Malay Peninsula and Ceylon. Today, it has expanded to 1.3 million hectares. Many new tools and new technologies—improved from the old techniques of the Indians—have emerged one after another. The characteristics and supply capacity of rubber trees have of course also been carefully studied, unlike the previous method of "killing the chicken to get the egg." Now, rubber trees produce rubber step by step, just like dairy cows supplying milk.

In 1900, Brazil supplied 26,000 tons of rubber. The rubber collected from other parts of the world was also about 26,000 tons. Artificial cultivation of rubber trees on Ceylon and the Malay Peninsula only produced 4 tons. By 1920, Brazil's production was still the same. Other parts of the world have reduced by four-fifths. The British cultivated rubber forests (including the South Seas Islands) produced 500,000 tons, and only from that one Hevea rubber tree!

### New US Ambassador to China, Gauss, Arrives in Shanghai This Morning; Attended a Grand Banquet Hosted by All US Nationals in Shanghai Tonight; Will Take the Original Ship to Hong Kong and Chongqing to Assume Office; New US Military Commander in Shanghai, Howard, Arrived Together

In order to strengthen diplomatic relations with China and provide strong support, the US authorities in Washington specially appointed Minister Gauss (pictured) to Australia to replace Dr. Johnson as the US Ambassador to China. In order to safeguard US interests in Shanghai, Colonel Howard was also selected to succeed Colonel Baker as the commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai. The Chinese government and the public expressed satisfaction and gratification with this measure by the US authorities, taking it as a significant attitude towards strengthening its Far East policy. They welcomed Gauss, an old friend of China, to be promoted to ambassador. Gauss has lived in China for many years, is familiar with the situation in China, and is well-known in diplomatic circles. This time, he will definitely contribute more to China and complete the tasks that China and the United States should shoulder. The details are recorded below:

Arrived in Shanghai This Morning, Staying Only One Night

Ambassador Gauss departed from New York on March 28th on the maiden voyage of the American President Lines' world-class passenger liner President Garfield to Shanghai. The ship docked at pontoon numbers 12 and 13. The Jianghai Customs reception ship Mary Muller was scheduled to carry passengers from the ship to the dock at 9:15 this morning. Ambassador Gauss arrived at the dock on time. The US Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai formed an honor guard and went to the dock to welcome him under the leadership of Colonel Baker. Gauss planned to stay in Shanghai for one night to catch up with friends. He will board the President Garfield again at 10:15 tomorrow morning and accompany the original ship via Shanghai to Hong Kong, and then go to the capital to take office. The US authorities here have arranged for him to stay at the Cathay Hotel.

New Commander Arrived on the Same Ship

Also arriving in Shanghai on the same ship as Gauss was Colonel Howard, the new commander of the US Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai. Commander Howard was originally the commander of the Sixth Battalion of the US Marine Corps in San Diego. According to reports, Howard has served in the Marine Corps for 27 years. On May 11, 1914, he was ordered to leave Washington to work for the Marine Corps. In 1938, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. He has served as the commander of the Marine Corps in Haiti, Santo Domingo, Washington, and other places. The US authorities in Shanghai are deeply gratified to have him. After Howard's arrival, he will take a short rest and then take office on schedule.

US Groups Host a Public Banquet Tonight

Before serving as the Australian minister, Ambassador Gauss served as the consul general in Shanghai. He had extensive contacts in Shanghai and was known for his shrewdness and ability. He has long been valued by his superiors in the US. In January 1940, Gauss was ordered by the State Council to go to Manila to meet with Admiral Hurd and Mr. Shaw, the special commissioner stationed in the Philippines, to hold a three-member summit to discuss the defense of the Philippines and review general issues in the Far East. US newspapers praised Gauss extensively. On January 19 of the same year, President Roosevelt appointed Gauss as the first minister to Australia. It has been exactly one year since he left Shanghai. The US nationals here and various public groups and friends of Gauss are overjoyed that Gauss has been appointed ambassador and returned to this place. In order to express their welcome and to reminisce about their separation, under the leadership of the American Chamber of Commerce, it was decided to hold a public banquet for Mr. Gauss at the Columbia Country Club on Great West Road at 7:00 tonight. The US Consul General and envoys from various countries in Shanghai will all attend.

Saying Goodbye and Welcoming, Baker Leaves Shanghai

The news of Colonel Baker's transfer to a position in the Navy Department in Washington was issued by the US Navy Department on March 8th of this year. Since the new commander has already arrived in Shanghai and Baker himself is under military orders, he will leave Shanghai on the President Taft of the American President Lines, which is returning from Manila and Hong Kong, on the 21st of this month, taking the route of Kobe, Honolulu, Los Angeles, and San Francisco to return to the country. All officers of the US Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai will hold a grand farewell banquet at the American Club from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM on the 20th of this month, and express their sincere welcome to the new commander, Colonel Howard. According to reports, Colonel Baker arrived in Shanghai on January 2, 1940, succeeding Colonel Fegan as the commander of the US Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai. Baker was born on May 29, 1894, in Briggs Field, California, USA. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1910 and became a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. He was a classmate and colleague of the new commander, Colonel Howard.

### Hong Kong Rice Sold Today; Tribute Rice Already Shipped; Rice Overstock in Hong Kong Urgently Expedited to Shanghai

The first batch of 53,196 bags of low-priced Hong Kong rice handled by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession arrived in port on the 11th and 12th of this month, successively loaded on the Hanyang, Mingsheng, Jiangsu, and Taiyuan ships. Because it happened to be raining heavily on those two days, it was not possible to unload them, and therefore the distribution procedures had not been completed. According to the person in charge of the Liki Company, he told the reporter of the Pingming News Agency that this low-priced rice can be sold by rice stores in the next two or three days. Notification slips have now been printed to urge the grain and sundry stores and rice stores that ordered the rice to pay the money in full and deliver the goods within three days, so that they can be sold on the market. As a result, in the past few days, except for the poor people who could not wait, almost no one has inquired at the rice stores. Rice prices fell again by three or four yuan yesterday.

Second Batch of Hong Kong Rice to be Shipped to Shanghai in Succession

According to shipping industry news, the second batch of Hong Kong rice will arrive in Shanghai within the next two days. The carriers are Jardine Matheson's Yusheng ship and Taikoo's Guangdong ship. As for the date of sale, according to Liki Company's manager Kneeschelle, it will be before the weekend, probably in the next one or two days. It is also heard that Liki Company has continued to order 250,000 bags from Hong Kong in preparation for shipping to Shanghai and selling them next month.

Starting Today, Going to Pick Up the Goods

Liki Company and Xiangmao Company, which are selling the Shanghai Municipal Council's Hong Kong rice, have been working very hard these days. According to reports, Liki Company is responsible for handling the ordering and picking up of goods, while Xiangmao Company is the payment place for those who ordered the rice. Liki Company has now completed the customs declaration and warehousing procedures for the first batch of Hong Kong rice shipped to Shanghai. It is heard that rice stores will start to pick up the goods from the two foreign companies today in preparation for sale. It is also learned that in order to promote the rapid purchase of this Hong Kong rice by rice stores in the concession area for sale on the market, the two concession authorities allow rice stores with relatively weak capital to gather several stores together to jointly order from Liki Company.

Payment and Delivery Based on Conditions

(1) Payment: Pay in full within three days, exchanging cash for warehouse receipts. (2) Delivery Period: Deliver the goods within ten days from the date of sale, otherwise the warehouse rent will be borne by the seller. (3) Weight: If the goods are not taken out within ten days from the date of sale, the goods will no longer be weighed, and the weight on the ship's bill of lading will be used as the weight at the time of delivery, and the buyer will receive it. (4) Insurance: From the date of sale, all risks of storing the goods will be borne by the buyer. Fire insurance is only valid for ten days from this date. (5) Other conditions: The buyer promises to strictly abide by the conditions of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession that he signed. In the future, when retailing, he promises that each bag or more of rice sold will be accompanied by an invoice stating the name and address of the buyer and seller, and a duplicate should be added for the police to inspect at any time when they come to the store. In addition, retailers must not supply each household with more rice than is needed by the family each month, and must not sell it except for Shanghai households.

Beware of Rice Weevils and Passing Off Inferior Goods as Superior

After receiving the payment notification slip from Liki Company, each miscellaneous grain store and rice store can pay the money at Xiangmao Company at 20 Guangdong Road within three days, and within ten days can bring the bill of lading to the warehouse noted on the bill to pick up the goods. As for the weighing procedures, the Shanghai Municipal Council has entrusted them to the two foreign companies: Pauling & Company at 2 Beijing Road and San Yi Company at 12 The Bund. Also, yesterday, there were widespread rumors in the two concessions that the Shanghai Municipal Council's low-priced Hong Kong rice had already been sold by various rice stores, which was not true. However, according to the reporter's investigation, a small number of rice stores were found in the French Concession that put up a sign saying "Low-Priced Rice" on their rice, priced at 110 yuan, and the rice was mostly mixed with scraps and was very different in quality from the 40-grain small rice from Yangon. When asked about it, they replied that this was the low-priced rice from Hong Kong to Shanghai, which was no different from the Hong Kong rice handled by the Shanghai Municipal Council, and advised the reporter to buy it. This kind of passing off inferior goods as superior has constituted a crime of fraud, which not only damages the reputation of low-priced rice, but also harms the interests of citizens. It is hoped that the concession authorities will thoroughly investigate and punish the offenders in order to deter the wicked.

Vietnamese Low-Priced Rice to Arrive in Shanghai Soon

According to the person in charge of the French Concession, the authorities also directly ordered 200,000 bags of tribute rice from the Vietnamese authorities some time ago in order to stabilize food for the people and suppress rice prices. The first batch of 50,000 bags has been loaded on the (1) Varenne ship, managed by the Hualun Company, with 30,000 bags. The ship is currently on its way to Shanghai via Yangon. (2) The Sarraut ship with 20,000 bags is expected to arrive on the 20th of this month. As for the remaining 150,000 bags, they will all arrive here by the end of this month at the latest. At that time, all legal rice stores in the French Concession will be able to enjoy the right to sell low-priced rice. As for its selling price, because the grain handled by the authorities is Saigon rice, the quality is guaranteed. The international exchange rate will be determined temporarily at that time. However, various procedures are the same as those of the Public Concession.

Hong Kong Overstocking Rice

Also, according to people from Hong Kong, in order to meet the needs, the Hong Kong government has long ordered a large amount of foreign rice from Vietnam, Siam, Myanmar, and other foreign rice producing areas, so the foreign rice shipped to Hong Kong has been surging in recent days, and the warehouses have been piled high. Therefore, the ships carrying Hong Kong rice to Shanghai this time must sail to Hong Kong to carry rice to Shanghai as soon as they finish unloading. Before the Hong Kong government implemented rice control, some rice merchants with greater power had asked the Hong Kong government to allow government-business cooperation, but this was rejected by the Hong Kong government, because the Hong Kong government was aware that the limited prices set each time had been undermined by unscrupulous merchants exceeding the limited prices, so it made this decision.

### Old Zhabei Police Inspector Yu Fugeng Ambushed: Seriously Wounded and in Critical Condition; Street Vendor Killed by Stray Bullet; Detectives and Rickshaw Driver Injured

Yu Fugeng, Inspector of the Old Zhabei Police Department of the Public Concession, was ambushed yesterday afternoon at approximately 5:00 PM while passing the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road on official duty. Two thugs suddenly emerged and fired more than ten shots from a new type of box-shaped pistol. Yu was hit in the forehead while in his rickshaw and collapsed on the spot, bleeding profusely and barely breathing. Four other people were injured or killed by stray bullets. The thugs then fled with their weapons, disappearing without a trace. The details are as follows:

Traveling by Chartered Rickshaw

Yu Fugeng, the Chinese Inspector of the Old Zhabei Police Department, is 55 years old and a native of Funing. He is known for being shrewd and capable, as well as kind and approachable, which has earned him the deep respect of his superiors. He resides at No. 2, Lane 1256, 11256 Avenue Edward VII. Yesterday, at approximately 5:15 PM, Yu left the Old Zhabei Police Department after finishing his duties and boarded a chartered rickshaw that he provided. Four detectives followed closely behind in a tram for protection.

Shot in the Forehead, Skull Shattered

As the rickshaw passed Nanjing Road and reached No. 294 Yunnan Road, in front of the clinic of Dr. Shen Huimin, two thugs in Western suits suddenly emerged. They had been lying in wait at the entrance of Lane 287 next door. Seeing Yu's rickshaw approaching, they immediately drew their new type of box-shaped pistols and fired more than ten shots without asking any questions. The bullets rained down like a string of pearls. One bullet struck Yu in the right forehead, piercing through to the left forehead, shattering his skull. He cried out "Ah!" and collapsed to the ground. He was also hit by a bullet in the waist.

Detective Injured, Book Vendor Killed

As the bullets flew, Yu's rickshaw puller, named Bai Shang (46 years old, from Tongzhou), was shot in both legs and also collapsed. Detective Shan Zhaoxian, 30 years old, from Tianjin, who was sitting in the tram behind, was also hit in both hands by stray bullets. Rickshaw puller Liu Dacheng, 30 years old, was injured in the right leg. Most tragically, a man named Wang Keming (42 years old, from Shaoxing), who had a small book stall next to the Yangtze Hotel's back door, was hit in the head and chest by two stray bullets and died instantly.

Large Car Riddled with Bullet Holes

At the time of the shooting, a large Yangtze Hotel passenger car, license plate number 15867, was parked on the side of the road. The car body was also hit, riddled with bullet holes, numbering six or seven. The surrounding glass was shattered. The Yangtze Hotel wall along the road also had multiple holes. Upon hearing the multiple gunshots, pedestrians and shopkeepers in the vicinity all scurried for cover. After firing, the thugs, seeing their objective achieved, fled with their weapons, disappearing without a trace.

Police Alert, Hunt for Culprits Unsuccessful

After being wounded, Yu collapsed in a pool of blood. Other detectives immediately helped him up and reported the incident to the Old Zhabei Police Department. Several red police vehicles were quickly dispatched to the scene. Traffic was blocked on Yunnan Road around Juekou Road. A strict search for the gunmen was initiated. After half an hour, the alert was lifted and traffic resumed. It is reported that the culprits were not apprehended.

Seriously Injured, Life in Danger

An ambulance was urgently called to the scene and transported the injured and the body to Renji Hospital. A surgeon performed an operation on Yu, but the injury to his head, with his skull shattered, was too severe. He is in critical condition and his life is in danger. The other injured are not seriously hurt. It was later learned that Yu had a club located at No. 8, B Yu, Hami Road, directly across from the Yangtze Hotel, where Yu would often take a break. His son, named Guoliang, previously studied at Jiaotong University and was just married at the Hu She on the 1st of this month.

### Li Zulai Appointed Deputy Manager of Bank of China

Li Zulai, Assistant Manager of the Salt Bank, has recently been hired by the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China as Deputy Manager. He assumed his duties on the 12th (the day before yesterday). Mr. Li enjoys a considerable reputation in the financial world.

### Maiden Voyage of the American S.S. President Garfield: Arrived in Shanghai This Morning

Departing for Hong Kong Tomorrow at Noon

The fourth new liner of the American President Lines' World Class, the S.S. President Garfield, has arrived from the East on its maiden voyage. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning at 7:30 AM, berthing at Buoy 12/13. Passengers will transfer to a company-provided launch to disembark at the Customs Wharf at precisely 1:00 PM. The liner is scheduled to set sail on its maiden voyage to Hong Kong, Xiaoluson, Singapore, and other Southeast Asian ports, then to Mumbai, around the Cape of Good Hope, and back to Boston to complete its circumnavigation. The ship's tonnage, design, and interior amenities are identical to those of the new ships like the Jackson, Monroe, and Hays. Due to these extraordinary times, public tours have been cancelled. The maiden voyage carries 74 passengers, 28 of whom will disembark in Shanghai. The remaining 46 will continue on the original ship for their Southeast Asian and around-the-world voyages. It brings 352 bags of mail. The number of Shanghai residents travelling to Southeast Asia on this ship has not yet been announced. The company's passenger launch is scheduled to depart from the Customs Wharf at precisely 10:15 AM tomorrow morning.

### S.S. Da Xin Arrives in Shanghai with Cotton: Detained for the Third Time

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," the American merchant ship S.S. Estelle L. Da Xin, carrying a large quantity of cotton from Huanglin Port at the mouth of the Yangtze River to Shanghai, and docked in front of Buoy No. 5 on the Bund, was detained again today (the 13th) by the Japanese authorities. This is the third time the ship has been detained in recent months. It is reported that the shipowner has begun negotiations with the Japanese authorities in order to release the ship this afternoon. At the same time, the American Consulate General has received notification regarding this matter. This afternoon, the ship remained tied to Buoy No. 5, with a Japanese military launch berthed alongside. The holds and foredeck were piled high with cotton. The Chinese crew members were unsurprised by the detention and said they expected to be released this afternoon. Japanese officials said that the S.S. Estelle L. was being detained because it was carrying contraband cotton. However, they made no statement regarding when the ship would be released or whether the cotton would be confiscated. It is noted that the ship was first detained for two weeks last summer at Wusongkou. In November, it was again detained along with twelve other foreign merchant ships for attempting to pass the Japanese blockade line off the coast of Zhejiang. It was not released until late February after negotiations between the American authorities and the Japanese side.

### Rockefeller Foundation Spent Over US$9 Million Last Year: Most Used for Public Health

The 1940 Rockefeller Foundation report has arrived in Shanghai. According to Foundation Chairman Fosdick, the Foundation had an income of $9,854,497 USD last year, of which $7,605,342.81 was from investments. In addition, $1,150,000 was withdrawn from the Foundation’s funds.

Use

The funds were used for six categories: (1) public health, $2,750,000; (2) natural sciences, $2,200,000; (3) social sciences, $1,500,000; (4) medicine, $1,300,000; (5) charitable work, $1,075,000; (6) rural construction in China, $200,000. Seventy percent of last year's expenditures were in the United States. Although hindered by the war, the Foundation was still able to use funds in 44 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas for construction and relief expenses. Therefore, the Foundation committee's

Work

was actually the most difficult year compared to the past. After the First World War, the School of Hygiene in Warsaw, the School of Public Health in Prague, the William Academy in Berlin, the Institute of Mental Therapy in Munich, and the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry in Gottingen received funds from the Foundation. However, due to the war, the individuals and groups that received grants could not continue to engage in research, as they were either imprisoned in concentration camps or had fled, and their research institutes were destroyed. The Foundation expressed its enthusiasm and respect for the scholars from various countries who suffered losses due to the war. The report continued that the Foundation's

Assistance

to major countries had two important targets. One was the construction of a 200-inch telescope at Mount Palomar in California, which was estimated to be worth $6 million in 1926. The International Education Association designed this project and it is nearly complete. The other was funding the University of California to build a cyclotron, which was designed by Professor Loren Qi of the school to examine the structure of atoms. This experiment will be of great assistance to chemistry, biochemistry, cardiology, and other sciences. It is clear that the above work is very important.

### Shooting Incident on Jing'an Temple Road Yesterday Afternoon: Tense Situation as Pedestrians Fled; Western Police Officer and Car Passengers Injured

At the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Haig Road in West Shanghai, the Public Concession Police Department had erected barbed wire fences to create two narrow lanes for vehicles to pass through, facilitating inspections. These facilities still exist today, and because the area is an American military defense zone, several American soldiers are also stationed there.

Dozens of Shots Fired by Both Sides

Yesterday at 1:40 PM, a black streamlined car, license plate number 460, carrying three men and one woman, passed through the entrance. The Western police officers stationed there stopped the car and approached to search it. It is unclear how, but a misunderstanding led to a shootout. Both sides fired dozens of shots.

Western Police Officer Shot, Car Passengers Injured

At the time, nearby shops and pedestrians, unaware of the truth, hurriedly closed their doors and fled, causing great disorder. As a result, a Western police officer, Badge No. 52, was shot and injured in the jaw. At the same time, two men in Western suits and the driver in the car, who were armed, were all shot and wounded, collapsing inside the car. However, the man and woman sitting in the back of the car were unharmed.

Police and American Military on High Alert

The Jing'an Temple Police Station, located nearby, immediately dispatched a large contingent of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to surround the car and transport the wounded to the Public Hospital for treatment. The American military camp, upon receiving the news, also sent American soldiers to guard the scene. It was later learned that two rickshaw pullers were also injured by stray bullets. It was also reported that the car owner was named Wu Yunfu, who was in the car with his wife at the time. The two Western-suited men who were injured were bodyguards.

### Male and Female Kidnappers: Conviction Finalized

Chinese detectives Zhao Lianxi and Wang Qi of the Central Police Station previously apprehended kidnappers who had abducted and hidden Hu Qinbao, Chen Guilin, Gu Jingen, Zhu Jincai, Gu Hanchu, and the woman Chen Shenshi. They confiscated two pistols and eight bullets and discovered that Hu and others had committed multiple cases of kidnapping for ransom, including the kidnapping of Huang Duanchu at No. 3 Fuyu Lane, Yunnan Road. After interrogation and conclusion of the case by the Special First Court, Judge Xiao Xiefen announced the verdict in the criminal court yesterday morning: Hu Qinbao and Gu Jingen were each sentenced to seven years and six months imprisonment. Chen Guilin, Chen Shenshi, Zhu Jincai, and Gu Hanchu were each sentenced to seven years imprisonment. The pistols, bullets, and threatening letters were all confiscated.

### Assassin of Xie Jinyuan: Detention Extended

Due to Uncompleted Investigation Procedures

Indefinite Postponement of Trial

Hao Jingcheng from Hebei, Zhang Guochun from Hubei, Yun Yaoliang from Hebei, and Zhang Wenqing from Henan, soldiers in the Lone Army Barracks, disobeyed the orders of their commander, Major General Xie Jinyuan, and were reprimanded. Hao and the other three dared to commit the crime of assassinating Xie. The four men were apprehended by police officers. The Special First Court approved their detention. Yesterday afternoon, the case was scheduled to be heard by the Special First Court. However, because the investigation procedures were not yet complete, the police lawyer Jiang Baolian applied to the court for an extension of the detention. Judge Jiang approved the application and ordered the prisoners to be detained pending an indefinite rescheduled trial.

### Dance Hall Boss Attacks and Injures Dancer: Chen Xiaofuzi's Attempt to Seduce Dancer Fails, Leading to Attack and Escape

Wang Xiarong, a 22-year-old local dancer with a beautiful appearance, works at the Xinhua Dance Hall next to the Nanjing Grand Theatre on Avenue Edward VII. She lives at No. 13, Lane 314, Baker Road. Because of Wang's attractive appearance, her nightly earnings as a dance partner are always the highest among the dance hall's dancers. This aroused the envy of Chen Xiaofuzi, the dance hall's floor manager (the leader in charge of the dancers), who is from Jiangbei.

Repeatedly Attempts Seduction

Because Wang refused to be complacent, Chen had no opportunity. On the 11th at 11:00 PM, Chen entered the hall and invited Wang to dance. Wang, due to professional obligations, felt she could not refuse and reluctantly agreed. She embraced Chen and stepped onto the dance floor. As they danced, Chen had evil thoughts and began to grope Wang's body. Wang stopped dancing and rebuked Chen, saying that as a floor manager, he should not violate his duties by engaging in

Improper Conduct

Chen became enraged and resorted to violence, grabbing Wang and punching her, and kicking her with his leather shoes, causing Wang to be injured. The dance hall manager intervened and persuaded Chen to stop. Wang returned home, enduring the shame and pain. The next day, she was unable to get out of bed due to her injuries. Her mother, after learning what had happened, took Wang to Baolong Hospital for treatment. After examining Wang, the doctor confirmed that her

Injuries Were Severe

and after learning that they were caused by a beating, reported the incident to the police according to regulations. The investigation revealed that the incident occurred in the French Concession, so the French police were notified. After detectives went to the hospital to investigate, they attempted to arrest Chen Xiaofuzi, the perpetrator. However, he had already fled home upon hearing the news. The police are now dispatching detectives to apprehend him and have strictly ordered the Siwa Dance Hall to hand Chen over. Wang Xiarong's injuries will require a long period of medical treatment to fully recover.

### Confucius's Doctrine: The Culmination of the Five Religions (Continued from Yesterday): Speech by Shen Daling at the Rongwu Society

Taoism: Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching, Chapter 10, states, "Carrying the soul and embracing the One, can you keep them from separation?" Wang Bi's commentary states, "To reside, to dwell. The soul is the constant dwelling place of man. The One is the true essence of man. This means that man can dwell in his constant dwelling place, embracing the One in purity of spirit, and never be separated from it?" Chapter 22: "The Sage embraces the One and becomes the model of the world." Chapter 39: "Heaven obtains the One and becomes clear; earth obtains the One and becomes tranquil; the spirit obtains the One and becomes divine; the valley obtains the One and becomes full; all things obtain the One and come into being; the ruler obtains the One and becomes the foundation of the world." Chapter 42: "Tao begets One, One begets Two, Two begets Three, Three begets all things." Zhuangzi's Nanhua Jing, Qi Wu Lun Chapter, states, "The Tao, when comprehended, becomes One." It also states, "All things have no creation or destruction, and ultimately return to One. Only the enlightened know that all things return to One." It also states, "Heaven and earth were born together with me, and all things are one with me." The De Chong Fu Chapter quotes Confucius as saying, "From the perspective of their sameness, all things are one." The Da Zong Shi Chapter states, "Its One is One, its not One is One." It also states, "To arrange and then go with the transformation is to enter into the desolate One of Heaven." Guo Xiang's commentary on Xiang Xiu states, "To be at peace with the shifts and changes and to go together with the transformations, is to enter into the desolation and become one with Heaven." The Tian Xia Chapter states, "The Sage has that from which he is born, and the Lord has that by which he is made complete, all originating from the One." It also states, "Rule with the Great One." It also states, "Love all things widely, Heaven and earth are one body." This is confirmed by the five universal paths in the Li Ji, Zhong Yong Chapter, which are the relations between ruler and subject, father and son, husband and wife, elder and younger brother, and friend and friend. The three universal virtues are benevolence, wisdom, and courage, which are practiced with One. One is born knowing, one learns knowing, one is troubled knowing, and one achieves knowing of the One. One is at peace acting, one is profited acting, one struggles acting, and one achieves success. Although Lao Tzu and Zhuangzi discuss both Heaven, Earth and all things, while Confucius focuses solely on human affairs, they are largely in agreement.

Christianity: The various Gospels of the New Testament, the various accounts in the Acts of the Apostles, and the God of Revelation.

Islam: The Truthful Master, translated as the Supreme Being, in the various chapters of the Koran, is absolutely supreme and to be followed without question. This aligns with the Analects, Ba Yi Chapter, "He who offends against Heaven has nowhere to pray to." Zi Han Chapter, "Who do I deceive? Do I deceive Heaven?" Ji Shi Chapter, "Have reverence for the Decree of Heaven," are also in agreement. Thus, the teachings of Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam, when discussed in terms of time, have a sequence, and when discussed in terms of place, are divided between China and the rest of the world, but they are all within the scope of my way which is threaded with One.

When we read the books of Confucius, it is not merely reading the paintings of the Five Religions. Recently, I have heard that Western scholars are increasingly studying Confucius. Will the Way of Confucius be practiced globally? In the past, Confucius gathered the great achievements of the many sages. Today, the Five Religions coexist without conflict, and the Way of Confucius gathers the great achievements of the Five Religions. This is precisely the great wish of "teaching without discrimination" in the Analects, Wei Ling Gong Chapter. How can we limit ourselves to Confucianism? I know that the Analects, Yan Yuan Chapter, tells Zhonggong, "What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others. Thus, there will be no resentment against you in the state, and there will be no resentment against you in the family." Wei Ling Gong Chapter tells Zizhang, "Let loyalty and sincerity be everything, and let every action be marked with conscientiousness and respect." In even the lands of the barbarians, it will be put into practice. Its effectiveness is assured. Therefore, I offer this prayer: I pray to the Great Accomplishment, the Most Sage Teacher Confucius, to harmonize the Five Religions, to save all lands, to elevate the world to the Great Harmony, and to witness the ultimate bliss of the people's livelihood. After the speech, Mr. Yang Zhongyi elaborated on the theory, citing extensively. He had not finished his speech, and it will be continued in the next session.

### American International Assurance Company: 20th Annual Shareholders' Meeting; General Manager Fei Mengfu Presents Report; Last Year's Profit Over US$70,000

The American International Assurance Company held its 20th Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Mr. Fei Mengfu, the company's General Manager, presented a report on the company's business conditions last year. The report is translated as follows:

Business Progress

At the 20th Annual Shareholders' Meeting of the American International Assurance Company, the Board of Directors authorized me to report on the company's business conditions last year. The company's business last year achieved a profit of US$75,963.62. After deducting US$39,791.09 for policyholder dividends, the net profit was US$36,172.503, which did not include profits from investments and exchange rates. This net profit was added to US$154,484.15 (the amount of surplus at the end of the previous year). In addition, there were investment profits of US$22,067, policyholder dividends that were cancelled and unclaimed of US$1,674.30, and profits from exchange rates and revaluation of investments of US$48,540.95, totaling US$108,454.76. Shareholder dividends paid out last year totaled 20,000 yuan. Managerial debt also increased to US$6,360.44. These are all items that should be deducted from the surplus. At the same time, the Board of Directors believes that another US$30,000 should be deducted from the surplus in order to increase the investment and exchange rate reserve to a total of US$60,000. The total amount deducted from the surplus reached US$56,360.44, resulting in a net surplus of US$206,578.49. Compared to the previous system in the United States, the company's life insurance reserve, which has already been established, currently reaches US$2,513,021.81. The company's total assets reach US$3,240,077.12, an increase of US$434,163,163.29 from December 31st of the previous year.

Sufficient Preparation

The company's investment allocation is extremely sound. The cash reserve is very large. This is not used to fulfill any debt obligations, but in the current world situation, strengthening liquid assets is extremely necessary. Although our cash reserve is extremely large, the income from interest, dividends, and rent still reaches US$98,558.18, or at least 3.56% of the company's assets, which is sufficient to maintain the interest required for the policy reserve.

Low Mortality Rate

In 1940, the mortality rate of the company's policyholders was extremely low, only reaching 42.5% of the expected rate. In 1939, the mortality rate reached 53.03% of the expected rate, which we already considered satisfactory. This special record is partly due to the surge in new policyholders in the past few years and at the same time proves that the war in the Far East has not had a significant impact on the mortality rate of the company's policyholders.

Increased Coverage

The important achievement of a life insurance company should be measured by the increase in effective insurance coverage. Based on this point, the company's performance last year was extremely impressive. New insurance coverage increased by 50% compared to the previous year. As a result, after deducting all invalid policies and paid claims, the company's effective insurance coverage increased by US$3,627,290.

Philippine Business

As of December 31st of last year, the company's total effective insurance coverage reached US$19,932,031, of which 50% was insured by the people of the Philippines, 16% was insured by the people of Hong Kong, and the remainder was spread throughout the company's business areas. As far as China is concerned, the total effective insurance coverage, calculated in US dollars, has been sharply reduced, accounting for less than 12% of the total. This is due to the devaluation of the Chinese legal tender. However, if calculated in the local currency, the figure would be a new record in the company's history. The development of business in the Philippines in the past few years has prompted the company to send important personnel to be stationed there permanently. In 1940, the Board of Directors decided to establish a head office in Xiaoluson to enhance the effectiveness of serving policyholders. It has already been established last year, managed by two company personnel. All business operations, such as policy issuance and claims, are fully handled by the two representatives of the branch office, without the need to transfer to the Shanghai office for decisions. As a result, the efficiency of the office has greatly increased.

Moving Forward

In 1940, as the war in China continued and the European war spread, the lives of residents in all areas within the company's business scope in the Far East were greatly affected. However, business continued to flourish, which can be regarded as a successful year for American International. The company's assets and surplus funds have both increased sharply. Although we are unable to make accurate predictions for the coming year, the Board of Directors believes that our company's preparations are sufficient to cope with any new situation. This is because the service spirit of our company's business personnel has never been criticized due to special circumstances. At the same time, the staff of the Philippine and Shanghai head offices are also loyal to their duties and moving forward.

### French Police Crack Down on Morphine Syndicate: Main Culprit Li Hongsheng on the Run

Morphine King Li Hongsheng has been operating a drug business and making a considerable profit. He has now secretly established his own facility, purchased machinery and opium, refined morphine, and secretly set up distribution agencies within the British and French Concessions for sales. This has now been discovered by the French police. Li secretly set up a drug distribution agency in Bu Yaoting's home on the upper floor of No. 60 Zhengjia Muqiao Street. Detectives Gao Meihui and Wang Dongwan, and officers Cao Chuanbiao and Zhou Jingyuan, rushed to search the premises at 11:00 AM on the day before yesterday. Bu Yaoting (46 years old, from Taixing) was arrested, and a large bag of morphine, weighing sixteen taels (one catty), cash of eight thousand one hundred yuan earned from selling drugs, and other miscellaneous items such as scales, sieves, and wrapping paper were confiscated. He was taken back to the police station for detailed investigation and handling. The police chief issued an order to strictly apprehend the main culprit Li Hongsheng, who is on the run, and bring him to justice.

### Trafficking in Persons: Luring and Raping Young Girls; Two Daughters of the Ye Family Lured, Raped, and Planned to be Sold to Fengtian, Case Cracked by Police

Sixteen-year-old Ye Xiuying, residing at No. 23 Ronghua Lane, Kangding Road, and fifteen-year-old Hua Yuezhen, residing at No. 20 Bao Yu Lane, Aven Road, went to the Great World ice rink together the night before last for ice skating. A Wuxi native named Zhou Bingfang (eighteen years old, residing at No. 10 Deyu Lane, Gansu Road) was also at the rink and began to tease the two girls. Before long, he managed to seduce them, and the three of them went together. Zhou lured the two girls to Room 40 of the Yun Sheng Hotel on Fujian Road. That night, Zhou raped both girls, defiling their virginity. Little did they

(8) Palpable Friendship

"Speaking of this matter, you are also partly to blame! Of course, I'm not saying you and Miss should not have developed this relationship, because she was forcibly deceived by my uncle, and there was no emotion between them at all, not even a proper status. It's very justifiable for her to love you and for you to love her. Besides, your behavior is always very pure. Even if you weren't my good friend, I would sympathize with you. However, old brother, can I ask you a question now? Please tell me: have I been treating you with all my heart as a friend these past few years? If so, then please tell me, why didn't you give me a slight hint beforehand...?"

Qiu Haitang's right eye, filled with tears, gradually opened.

"If I had understood a little earlier, today's events wouldn't have become such a mess!" Yuan Shaowen said powerfully, with a look of great regret on his face.

Remorse surged from Qiu Haitang's own heart, but he still didn't know what to say to Shaowen.

"Furthermore, regarding today's events, I wasn't just standing by. I was so anxious that I lost my composure, and all I wanted to do was to bring Lao Hu over to help you plead for leniency. Unexpectedly, we were a step too late, and instead ruined you! I could have had a falling out with him - and in fact, we almost did! But thinking about it carefully, he's still human, and of course he's going to be angry. If such a thing happened to you or me, we probably wouldn't be without anger either? Besides, this bad idea wasn't even his. Old brother, you have to remember that I'm still his junior, and with Lao Hu doing his best to persuade him from the side, in this situation, what else could I do except rush you to the hospital for treatment?"

Qiu Haitang still felt like he had nothing good to say.

"Now, I'm the one who sent you to the hospital," Shaowen said, raising a finger and pointing it at himself several times. "If you stubbornly insist on your own way, refusing to take medicine, refusing to let them treat you, then you're deliberately making things difficult for me!..." (105)

### "The Ransom"

— Yifan

Although rice prices are soaring, the meat shops are no less crowded than in the old days, showing that there are indeed many wealthy people on this isolated island. After all, one must first pay for rice before going to the meat shop!

Near Zhejiang Road, there is a "Lu Gao Jian" meat shop, and business is really too good. Customers fill the shop every day, and those who arrive later are bound to be disappointed. The shop owner, being unable to handle the crowd and also to reward customers, has started selling "meat tickets" from the day before yesterday. Those who hold meat tickets can collect their meat the next morning, thus avoiding the worry of "sold out."

Rice prices have exceeded 140 or 150 yuan, and the poor are wandering in a "land of hunger" every day. They probably haven't tasted meat in three years. But the rich will feel uncomfortable if they don't have meat for a day. Meat is rich in fat! No wonder they are all getting fat and bloated. If I were a meat shop owner, I would definitely raise the meat price sharply, because with the loyal customers, there would absolutely be no problem with business. They see meat as their third life, second only to rice.

Urban Psychology

### The Story of "Nine Jiao..."

— Zhong Zimang

A "philanthropist" gives a beggar one cent, and the beggar cries bitterly, "Sir, one cent isn't even enough for a big pancake!" But how would the "sir" know the market price of pancakes? Opening one's purse is already a "generous act" - although one cent is just the smallest "atom" in the "sir's" wealth, it sometimes occupies an important position in the "sir's" mind.

Now, let's say the "sir" walks into a department store - the "sir" wants to buy a glass cup.

So he finds the glassware department. As usual, this "sir," although wealthy, knows the "difficulty" of earning money. He has spent a lot of effort, although he's willing to let his son secretly take bits and pieces for a life of wine and extravagance! He himself might as well suffer a little, so he always puts "economy" first. Of course, even when buying a glass, he has to choose a cheap one.

He asks the clerk to show him Sichuan products. The clerk takes out a light blue cup.

The "sir" takes it in his hand, looks at it, and asks the clerk how much it costs.

The clerk replies that he has to pay one yuan.

The "sir" is not happy. He thinks: another yuan, once you break a ten-yuan bill, you only have nine left. How can I afford that? The "sir" doesn't have the hesitation of a young man. He claims: the quality is too poor, it's not strong enough, and it's probably going to explode when filled with hot water. After stating his reasons, the "sir" decides to go to the second store.

The "sir" arrives at another department store. Without even looking for the glassware department, there are piles and piles of glasses. The "sir" inquires about the price: "Nine jiao and seven fen." The "sir" taps the glass. The "sir" is very satisfied. The "sir" says to himself: only nine jiao and seven fen, much cheaper. When you break a ten, you still have more than nine left, cheap, cheap. The "sir" doesn't even want to "shop around," he buys it.

Then the "sir" suddenly thinks about getting a haircut, but he still has to pick and choose.

The "sir" walks into a "nine jiao and nine" barbershop. The "sir" is satisfied and presses his butt down on the spring. The "sir" gets a haircut.

When the "sir" pays, the "sir" takes out a legal tender and asks the barber to give him change.

The barber smiles contemptuously and hands over one cent, as if giving it to a beggar.

The "sir" walks on the road, a beggar stretches out a hand: "Sir, I'm starving to death, starving to death... Sir."

The "sir" throws the remaining one cent to the beggar. The "sir" has completed the style of a "philanthropist."

The barber and his colleagues are talking about the "sir's" stinginess and their "miscalculation." But if they added the "nine jiao and nine fen" and "one fen," they wouldn't have gotten the business.

### Coincidence

— Qishui

A department store

At the store entrance: "...Little girl is sick, please save the little girl..."

On the store door: "...If the little darling is a little uncomfortable, just one bottle of pills, guaranteed to be better than anything..." (Extremely soft, sweet, and excessive)

At the store entrance: "...Sir, do you have any rice coupons..."

On the store door: "...Oh, Mr. Le of Le Mansion, didn't report to the local authorities, nine evening show tickets, hurry, got it, delivered right away..."

At the store entrance: "...Oh dear, haven't eaten for three days, 'Sir,' it's really hard to bear in my stomach, sir..."

On the store door: "...I, the old man, am guarding this empty city, guaranteed to trap Sima Zhong with this trick, come on, clear the way..."

At the store entrance: "...Distressed person... sick and unemployed, no relatives, parents, wife, and children, penniless... Please, sir..."

And again the booming voice from the store door: "...I'm like a caged bird, with wings hard to spread, I'm like..."

### "So and So"

— Xu Daming

When someone asks about the situation in Shanghai, the person answering always shakes their head and sighs, at most saying "so and so!"

Well, how did it become "so and so"? The person answering refuses to answer, at most saying vaguely, because "so and so," therefore "so and so!"

If you insist on asking for the bottom line, then it's really a bit embarrassing; actually, in "so" Shanghai, the origin of "so and so" is self-evident.

Moreover, "enlightened people" don't need "detailed explanations," and there's only one "truth" like this!

### Presented to Wang Ziping, Bone-Setting Physician

— Zhenghong

Yan Zhao is full of extraordinary men.  You, sir, are truly exceptional.  You wield your fist and destroy foreign races (Sir, you once defeated the Russian strongman, Kang Tai'er).  You amaze with bone replacements.  You fight at the front with long halberds.  Iron spears are displayed on the rack.  The Central Plains is in the midst of a bitter war.  We will not allow you to retire, old man.

The World of Entertainment

### Starting with "A Chronicle of Sorrow"

— Xiao Peng

Among the many modern playwrights, Xia Yan is the one who leaves an indelible impression on people. Playwrights who advocate art for art's sake only know how to focus on form and don't care about the impact of the play's performance on society. Some playwrights understand the mission of drama, but because they lack cultivation, they can't make the script figurative and fall into the form of a disguised lecture. The advantage of Xia Yan's plays is that they not only consider social value, but also have true artistic value. The production of "Under the Eaves of Shanghai" and "A Year's Leisure" is the practice of his correct drama theory. The uniqueness of his works is the reality of the content and the simplicity of the form - Chinese, popular, and "well-liked and easily understood" by the petty bourgeoisie. He accepts the advantages of Western drama, but he doesn't allow his works to become completely Westernized. He accepts the tradition of Chinese old opera, but his works are not a reproduction of old opera. The depth of character portrayal and the refinement and conciseness of the form are consistently preserved in his works.

In the past—and it can be said now—the theater world has asked playwrights to "represent Shanghai." Obviously, Xia Yan has put the most effort into "representing Shanghai." "Under the Eaves of Shanghai" and "A Corner of the Metropolis" are powerful works of "representing Shanghai." "A Chronicle of Sorrow" is his new work that "represents" "Shanghai" after August 13th. Of course, I only saw a portion of it introduced in the "Small Theater" magazine, but I feel that "A Chronicle of Sorrow" is still as fresh and lovely as his past works, and surpasses other dramas that "represent Shanghai."

The content of "A Chronicle of Sorrow" targets the current phenomenon of speculation in Shanghai and points out the tragedy of the fall of speculators. The performance of such a realistic work can undoubtedly play a positive role. If the performance of a play must pay attention to the effect of "this time and this place," then "A Chronicle of Sorrow" can serve as a model for Shanghai's theatrical movement. At the same time, any scripts that are harmful to "this time and this place," even if famous actors can be used as a selling point, should be strictly rejected.

"A Chronicle of Sorrow" and "Striving for Strength" were successively adopted by the Shanghai Drama and Art Society as plays to be staged. However, the performance effects of the two plays in "this time and this place" are completely different. The former is beneficial to "Shanghai," while the latter is of no benefit to "Shanghai." I hope to stage more plays like "A Chronicle of Sorrow" and fewer plays like "Striving for Strength." I hope to stage more plays that "represent Shanghai" and pay attention to the effects of "this time and this place." This important task should be shouldered by the Shanghai Drama and Art Society, which has always had a serious attitude, and by progressive theater workers.

### A Record of Listening to Kunqu Opera in the Rain

— Gu Mei

The Xianni Society is the only Kunqu troupe in the South, just like the Shengqing Society in the North. However, the Shengqing Society is formed by gathering old performers, while Xianni is purely composed of students from the New Music Academy. The Xianni Society was most popular during its performances at the Small World and the Great World. Later, when the young male actor Gu Chuanjie abandoned his career and the old male actor Shi Chuanzhen died of illness, and since the outbreak of the war, members either fled to other places or changed careers. Chuanqian, Fang Chuanyun, Zheng Chuanjian, Wang Chuansong, Hua Chuanhao, Zhou Chuanying, Zhang Chuanfang, Shao Chuanjun, etc., ran through various waterways and troupes, but still could not make a living. Fearing that they would be stranded in other places, they returned to Shanghai together, united as one, and worked together to reorganize the Xianni Society. They performed at the Daxin Company Amusement Park, and the audience was extremely large at that time. Later, they went to the Oriental Bookstore, but soon the members became distracted, and Xianni dispersed again. Suddenly, several years have passed.

Not long ago, Zheng Chuanjian, Zhu Chuanming, Zhou Chuanying, Wang Fuqian, etc., after rehearsing Kunqu opera, formed a small troupe at the Oriental Bookstore, performing Kunqu opera for two hours every Saturday and Sunday starting at 5:15. From then on, Xianni's beautiful songs could be heard again, although the talents were uneven, it was better than nothing.

Last Saturday's program included "The Jade Hairpin" ("Flirting with the Zither"), "Selling Horses" ("Crying at the Prison," "Writing the Accusation," "Three Pulls," "Reunion"). I went to listen in the rain. When I entered, Zhou Chuanying and Zhang Chuanfang's "Flirting with the Zither" had already started. Chuanying's male character, since Gu Chuanjie abandoned his career, has been solely responsible. In the past five or six years, his artistic skills have improved rapidly. I once watched his "Broken Bridge" scene, and his stage steps and body movements were so elegant, and the beauty of his sleeve movements was so wonderful, that even Chuanjie and Zhenfei would have to sigh that they were inferior. "Flirting with the Zither" is one of his masterpieces, depicting Pan Bizheng, expressing flirtatiousness in gentleness, revealing romance in conversation, without losing the nature of a scholar. Zhang Chuanfang's Chen Miaochang is also meticulous, and her lines are very pleasant to listen to. I have seen Cheng Yanqiu and Yu Zhenfei perform this, and Yanqiu's Chen Miaochang is bashful and angry, with a sense of proportion in everything, which Zhang Chuanfang does not reach. Zhenfei's Pan Bizheng is good in every way, but unfortunately too vulgar, not like a gentle and refined scholar, because "flirting" is mistaken for "hanging." "Selling Horses" was performed by Zheng Chuanyun, Zhu Chuanming, Shao Chuanjun, Zhou Chuanying, and Wang Chuansong. Because Wang Chuansong did not come, Zheng Chuanjian's Li Qi, Wu Zixu in "Sending the Son," and Li Guinian in "Playing Words" are all considered masterpieces. His tone and expression are enough to rival Wei Qinglin in the North, and cannot be compared to Zhang Chunyan, Li Baokui, or Guan Shengxi in Peking Opera. Zhu Chuanming's Li Guizhi's melody and lines, are both refined, elegant, gentle, and charming, showing her acting skills to the fullest, and she can be called a master of portraying emotions, rivaling Cheng Yanqiu in Peking Opera (Yanqiu's Kunqu opera was mostly taught by Chuanming). Shao Chuanjun's Zhao Chong is less dashing than Yu Zhenfei, but his voice is broader and brighter than Yu's, and both his singing and lines are commendable. "Breaking into the Camp" felt less compact due to the absence of Wang Chuansong's Old Master Hu. Zhou Chuanying's Li Tai is not his forte, but he is still stable. In Kunqu opera, the god of the water monster wears a mask and sings in the net role voice, which is slightly different from Peking Opera, which uses a shaved old man to play the character with a bare face and black lines painted around the nose and eyes. Liu Qiong and Zhang Wan in "Broken Heart Flower" (originally titled "The Soul Returns to the Land of Regret") are the first work of Yuan Meiyun and her husband, self-funded.

Chen Yunshang's New Work

Chen Yunshang has been busy filming "Home" and "Wild Roses." In "Wild Roses," Chen Yunshang plays a naive and wild girl, so there are various shots of nudity. The United Nations authorities have specifically declined visits.

Gu Lanjun Gives Birth

Gu Lanjun, with a large belly, gave birth to a son the night before last (the 12th). Because the fetus was too large, she had a difficult labor. Dr. Qu Shaohang and his wife performed the operation, and she gave birth safely. Mother and child are both safe after delivery.

### Brief Theatre News

The Russian Art Theatre on Foch Road will present a three-act satirical comedy, "Before Leaving," written by playwright Jiang Liu, at 3:00 p.m. (new time) and 8:00 p.m. tomorrow. This spring, the company once performed famous plays such as "Survival and Death," achieving great success. In the past two months, the company's organization has been strengthened and completely renewed. This kind of social drama that grasps reality is indeed worth watching. (2) The Jiliu Drama Society's tenth performance of "Peacock Flies Southeast," directed by Ma Ling, with actors Lu Yukun, Ma Ji, Ma Xiaonong, Min Qiu, Wang Di, Hong Wei, etc., is scheduled to be performed at the Ningbo Tongxiang Association on May 23. Tickets are already on sale at Minsheng Middle School, No. 424 Beijing Road, Central Racket Factory, Xiafei Road, and Chinese Fifth Vocational School, Wufu Lane, Nanjing Road.

### Figures in the Pear Garden

— N腔B调人張云我璋製图傳

(4) Cheng Yanqiu

Cheng Yanqiu is also known as one of the great Dan performers, because his singing style is uniquely creative. The high notes soar into the clouds, and the low notes are as twisting and turning as a swimming dragon. He is adept at singing Qingyi roles, and recent Qingyi singers have competed to follow the Cheng style. Cheng is usually as gentle as a Confucian scholar, unlike a performer. In his early years, he received assistance from Mr. Li Shizeng to perform abroad, and was very well received by people from other countries. He founded the Beiping Opera School and donated his property to be used as school buildings, which was highly praised for a time. Before he became famous, the late celebrity Mr. Yinggong tried his best to help him. After Luo died, Cheng personally buried him and was very generous. People in the artistic circle praised him for being full of affection and righteousness. He has sons, who are now studying in France, and Cheng uses all his earnings from performing to cultivate his sons. Last year, he was hired to go south, and his play "Locking the Scales" is still a popular hit. It is said that he will come to Shanghai again this year to perform at the Golden Grand Theatre.

### Bloody Rain, Jade Flowers

— Yi Mingdao

At this time, Xu Jing was really in a dilemma, standing there thinking secretly. What Wang Yongtai said seemed to indicate that he already knew the truth of the matter, but in fact, he was still in the dark. How could he know! It must be that prostitute who deliberately used this handkerchief to frame me. Last night, she secretly fabricated stories in front of Wang Yongtai, twisted the facts, and said my fault, falsely accusing me in every way. And Wang Yongtai listened to these preconceived notions, suspecting that I had some improper behavior, so he rebuked me before I could even say anything. Alas! I was holding a heart full of loyalty, intending to give him loyal advice, but who knew that I would suffer an unjust grievance? This matter must be clarified so that he knows that I, Xu Jing, am an extraordinary man, how could I have immoral things? However, with his attitude of aloofness and rejecting people from a thousand miles away, it is also difficult for me to defend myself, and there is no way to clear my name. What should I do? After a long time, he suddenly thought of a way, and said to himself: "Okay, I will decide to do this, and a little delay will allow things to come to light. Where one is not welcomed, one can always find a place to stay. Since he asked me to leave, why should I shamelessly continue to eat and sleep here?" Thinking of this, he stamped his foot, gritted his teeth, and walked back to his room with his head down. Just as he stepped into the door, it suddenly made him stunned. (End of Chapter VIII)

Chapter IX: What Brings You to the Ends of the Earth, My Lord

Xu Jing stepped into his own room, and suddenly saw that the maid beside He Ji had already packed up his luggage and bedding and threw them on the bed. Seeing Xu Jing enter the room, she took out five taels of silver from her clothes, placed them on the table, and said with a smile: "I am under the order of Madam, to pack your luggage for you. Madam told me to tell you, you should leave well from now on, don't blame Madam, it's really that you yourself are too unfeeling. These five taels of silver are to send you as travelling expenses. Madam should have prepared a feast to see you off, but because you are unwilling to see her, she will not come to see you either. And there is one more thing to say, if you have nowhere to go after you leave and sincerely regret it, as long as you come here to ask to see her and are willing to listen to Madam's words, Madam can also explain everything for you in front of the master..." The maid said in a series of words, and Xu Qing felt a burst of anger early in the morning, thinking that this was clearly He Ji sending her to insult me. What a slut! Oh, I will have to let you know my power in the future. Then he glared at the maid and said: "Bah! What nonsense are you talking about? Shut up quickly. Your Master Xu doesn't want to hear your kind of talk. If you say it again, watch me slap you twice. What is this silver? Who cares about her stinking money? Are you here to make fun of me?" While speaking, he threw the silver on the ground, raised his fist with one hand, and made a threatening gesture. The maid was timid after all, and was so frightened that she slipped out of the room. Xu Qing sighed again and said: "Wang Yongtai! Wang Yongtai! It's a pity that your lifelong reputation will be ruined by this vixen!" (62)

### An Outline of the Philosophy of Diligence

— Zong Yu

Analyze an "I" from the whole, I become a small "one." Transcend the whole, establish an "I," I become a big "one." Recognizing "I" as a big "one" is arrogance; recognizing "I" as a small "one" is mediocrity. The result of arrogance is the loss of human sociality and progress; the result of mediocrity is the loss of human self-esteem.
