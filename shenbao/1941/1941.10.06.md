The telegram stated that the Japanese launched the offensive at dawn yesterday, assisted by tanks and aircraft. It is reported that the Chinese army is resisting the Japanese advance very strongly. At the same time, the attention of the Chinese people remains focused on the situation in northern Hunan. (5th dispatch from Reuters)

Chongqing: Chinese here all believe that the military actions currently being taken by the Japanese around Zhengzhou are largely for political purposes, namely to cover up the failure in the Hunan campaign. It is said that Zhengzhou is located at the intersection of the Longhai and Pinghan railways. Since the Japanese occupied the eastern section of the Longhai and the north-south sections of the Pinghan, it has long lost its military importance. For three years, the Japanese army has been separated from Zhengzhou only by the Yellow River, and it is located on the plains, making it difficult to defend once the Japanese troops cross the river.

Editorial

### Britain, the United States, and the Far East

The concern of the Western democratic powers for the Far East has recently reached an unprecedented level in history. The British War Cabinet sent Duff Cooper as a special representative to the Far East on August 26 to investigate the necessity of setting up a wartime cabinet mechanism in Singapore. For more than a month, he has been constantly traveling between Malaya, the Philippines, Burma, and India, making various important contacts and inspections. He also convened a meeting in Singapore earlier this month, attended by British Far East Commander-in-Chief Brooke-Popham, Straits Settlements Governor Thomas, China Fleet Commander Layton, Ambassador to China Kerr, Ambassador to Thailand Crossby, and Australian Minister of Commerce Page. The significant nature of this meeting can be easily understood from the attending figures. In addition, in terms of finance and economy, Bank of England Governor Niemeyer and U.S. Treasury Secretary's technical assistant Cochraine both flew from the U.S. to the Far East in early September to assist China in solving financial problems; at the same time, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, who came to the Far East to investigate economic conditions, arrived in the Chinese capital two days ago, receiving a warm welcome from the Chinese government and people, and will go to Hong Kong today to join Niemeyer and Cochraine in attending the trilateral financial meeting convened in Hong Kong. What is particularly noteworthy is that the British and American military leaders in the Far East, such as British and American Far East Commander-in-Chief Brooke-Popham and MacArthur, U.S. Far East Fleet Commander Hart, and the U.S. military delegation to China, Magruder, gathered in Manila the day before yesterday to conduct important discussions. Although it concerns military secrets and the outside world has no way of knowing the details, judging from Brooke-Popham's statement that the scope of this meeting is wider than ever before, it can be asserted that it must be closely related to the developing current situation in the Far East, and is a concrete discussion of military cooperation in the Far East by the ABCD line-up. How to ensure that British and American aid materials can be delivered to China accurately and quickly is also clearly stated as one of the important topics of this meeting. Recently, China has demonstrated with the great victory in the Battle of Northern Hunan that it will never fail the expectations of all righteous people in the world, and can indeed shoulder the important task of the anti-aggression war in the Far East single-handedly without shame. Therefore, although the Soviet-German war has become more intense in recent days, and American oil tankers in the South Atlantic have continued to fall victim to Nazi actions, it is difficult to shift people's interest and attention away from the Far East.

In the past, Japan has constantly claimed that it is being surrounded, but that was just an excuse for its preparations for expansion. At that time, the democratic countries in the Far East were indeed exposed in an isolated and unprepared state. British and American Far East defenses were constantly being strengthened, but there was a lack of planned joint action, and especially with regard to China, which was fighting hard against Japan, the necessary connection was never established. After the formation of the Tripartite Pact, Britain and the United States began to consider emergency preparations in the Far East. Concrete measures were taken after Japan's advance into Vietnam this summer. As the situation has developed to this point, Japan has reached the maximum extent of its peaceful southward advance. Strategically, it has indeed seized the convenience of advancing and retreating freely, but it is clearly not enough to cope with the combined strength of the ABCD powers, so there has been hesitation and prudence in the last two months. On the other hand, it is attempting to lift the economic pressure by conducting negotiations with the United States. This is a retreat to advance, and it is also looking forward to the resolution of the war against China and the final outcome of the Soviet-German war. However, judging from the general trend, Japan is already in a state similar to suffocation, and its strength can only be consumed and weakened. Even if it implements all possible economic mobilization plans, it is difficult to expect significant improvements. As for the strength of the ABCD line-up in the Far East, it is being actively strengthened, and it will be further strengthened with the advancement of the U.S. Lend-Lease Act and defense programs. If it is said that the Axis should be defeated by starting with its weakest link, the recent Far East happens to meet this condition.

Among the democratic powers, their concern and preparation for the Far East have indeed reached the highest level, but their view of defeating the Nazis above all else still seems unchanged, as evidenced by the fact that U.S.-Japan negotiations are still in a state of being "藕断丝连" (connected like a broken lotus root). According to the conversation between Duff Cooper and Brooke-Popham, the former stated that both Britain and the United States do not want the war to spread to the Pacific, while the latter clearly stated that war in the Far East is the last step in the eyes of the British, and Hitler is the great enemy of the British. From this, it can be seen that the various measures taken by Britain and the United States in the Far East are still essentially passive, in other words, they are waiting for the belligerents to take action before reluctantly rising up to respond, and at the very least, they are not immediately preparing to take active measures to seek a thorough clarification of the dangerous situation in the Far East; and the hope that Japan will come to its senses, even if extremely weak, has not yet been abandoned. For this reason, it is necessary to avoid some necessary measures that may offend Japan, such as the fact that Britain and the United States have never engaged in cooperation with the Soviet Union in the Far East, and it seems that both Britain and the United States are deliberately avoiding this. The Nazis are naturally the great enemy of the democratic countries, and the Nazi henchmen with sinister intentions should not be tolerated, especially. Recently, Hitler launched another large-scale offensive against the Soviet Union, and the Japanese army has also reorganized its offensive in China. It is not known whether this is a planned conspiracy. Hitler's recent speech that French-Japanese relations are improving should not be taken lightly. In order to be prepared for all eventualities, Britain and the United States have the necessity to consider more active and proactive measures and steps in the Far East.

### British Military Personnel Deeply Impressed by Chinese Army After Battle of Northern Hunan; Japanese Invitation to Foreign Reporters in Shanghai to Inspect Changsha Becomes a Laughing Stock in London News Circles

London (Delayed): British military personnel have a very deep impression of the strength shown by the Chinese army in the Battle of Northern Hunan. The Japanese invitation to foreign reporters in Shanghai to inspect (Japanese-occupied Changsha) has become a laughing stock in London news circles. Japanese Cabinet spokesman Ishii initially made exaggerated statements, and when someone later asked what impact the Battle of Northern Hunan would have on U.S.-Japan talks, he only replied that "Please ask the U.S. government." The different tones before and after are quite interesting. The Japanese defeat has greatly weakened its (powerful military force). In the eyes of people in Britain and allied countries, the so-called (powerful military force) of the Japanese is not worth mentioning. On the contrary, China has raised the prestige of Chinese generals and soldiers with its achievements based on facts, not just empty words. (2nd dispatch)

### Foreign Reporters Arrive in Guilin, Transfer to Hunan for Inspection

Chongqing: According to news received by the official Central News Agency today, a group of foreign reporters heading to the front lines of Changsha arrived in Guilin by plane last night. These people took the train north to Hunan and are scheduled to arrive at the Chinese military headquarters today. Among these people are U.S. Embassy Military Attaché Colonel MacGuire, British Embassy Colonel Fletcher, TASS's Yakov Semin, United Press's Fisher, Associated Press's Mosa, Reuters' Zhao Jun Sydney, Morning Post's MacDonald, and Central News Agency's Lu. The Soviet military attaché canceled his trip at the last minute because the plane was full and he was unable to bring his Russian translator. (5th dispatch from Associated Press)

### Tianjin Affected by Freezing Order, Commercial Activity Depressed

Tianjin: According to statistics published here, Tianjin is one of the major Chinese commercial ports most severely affected by the freezing order. Tianjin has always been a prosperous commercial area, but now it is lifeless. The freezing order has caused goods worth millions of dollars shipped from Tianjin by Japanese ships via Japanese ports to the UK and the US to be stranded in Japan. Taking the leather goods shipped from Tianjin as an example, the goods currently frozen in Kobe are worth about US$750,000, equivalent to more than 15 million Chinese currency. In addition, there are also bristles, peanuts, carpets, eggs, and other items. Currently, Japanese shipping companies do not have ships traveling between the US and Japan, so the only way to remedy the situation is to send ships from the US to load the goods. However, this is a matter that needs to be discussed between the US and Japanese governments. Although merchants are running around busily, the prospect of transporting goods to their destination or shipping them back to Shanghai from Japan to await transfer by US ships is very bleak. (5th dispatch from Reuters)

### Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Prepares to Form Overseas Chinese Enterprise Company

Overseas Chinese subscriptions will be calculated in US dollars, with each share priced at ten dollars. According to sources from the Commission, overseas Chinese interest in domestic investment is growing daily. The Cuban Chinese Chamber of Commerce plans to invest one million US dollars, and overseas Chinese in Peru are also initiating the establishment of a South American Overseas Chinese Enterprise Company.

### British and German POW Exchange Postponed

London Official Announcement: Hess Will Not Be Returned

United Press, London, 5th: An official announcement last night stated that the exchange of British and German prisoners of war, scheduled to take place today in the English Channel, has been postponed due to various difficult issues. The declaration stated that the issue lies in Germany's request to change the British organization for returning German prisoners of war. In response to inquiries regarding Hess, the third Nazi to fly to Scotland, he is not included in this prisoner exchange. The declaration explained that international law does not include individual detainees, only those within the scope of prisoners of war. It also stated that both sides are now considering when this exchange can be realized. Reuters, London, 5th: Last night, it was learned that the reason for the temporary suspension of the exchange of wounded prisoners between Britain and Germany was that the German government, in the final negotiations, pointed out that the number of German prisoners of war being returned was less than that of British prisoners of war, and therefore requested that German civilian prisoners also be included, but not as a necessary condition for the exchange of prisoners. The British government replied that it had long declared its willingness to mutually repatriate men and women of age and children over military service age. In order to express this intention, it is willing to return the first batch of 60 German civilians along with sick and wounded German soldiers. On Friday, the German government replied that the German side needed a little more time to consider the British reply and was not prepared to proceed with the exchange of prisoners in accordance with the original plan. If the British side does not receive a satisfactory reply by Sunday, the German prisoners of war in the hospital ship will disembark and take a short rest. The British authorities are simultaneously carrying out the necessary arrangements for the return of the first batch of German civilians. It is estimated that 50 German women, all supporters of Hitler, left the concentration camp in the Isles of Man and arrived in London yesterday.

Reuters, London, 5th: The British War Office stated yesterday that 300 Indian soldiers captured by the enemy, all from the state of Punjab and of the Hindu faith, are now being detained in a large prisoner-of-war camp in Germany. They are admired by the German guards for their carefulness, cleanliness, and orderliness. Most are assigned to labor, especially in agriculture, while others serve in industries such as painting, bricklaying, road repair, and papermaking. Their treatment appears to be good. One concentration camp in a small village has various entertainment and sports facilities.

### Soviet Forces Fighting Along Entire Front, Situation Extremely Tense, Nazi Offensive Focused on Both Flanks, Soviet Counter-Offensive Against Central Sector

TASS, Moscow, 5th: The Soviet Information Bureau issued a battle report stating that on the 4th, our army fought the enemy along the entire front. On the 2nd, 51 enemy aircraft and 2 observation balloons were shot down in air combat, and our side lost 19 aircraft. On the 3rd, three enemy aircraft were shot down at the mouth of Moscow, and on the 4th, five were shot down. An enemy cargo ship was sunk in the Barents Sea.

Reuters, London, 5th: A Reuters military commentator stated that the Soviet situation has now reached an extremely tense stage. To understand this situation, the entire front must be viewed as one large battlefield. The final decision in this war has not yet arrived. The Nazi attack is currently focused on both flanks of the Soviet front, while the Soviet army is launching a major counter-offensive against the central sector of the German front, making slow and steady progress. Smolensk is surrounded and under threat. The Soviet army is currently at both extremes of its battle line, one near Leningrad in the north and the other east of Poltava and on the Crimean Isthmus in the south, responding to fierce attacks with local, forceful counter-offensives and strong defenses. The Nazis have mobilized all available troops, artillery, and tanks in an attempt to achieve results in these two major attacks. The final reserves are now almost fully mobilized. The outcome of this battle is still uncertain. This is a critical period for both sides as they engage in all-out fighting. However, the Soviet Union is not without hope and has the possibility of a major victory. If that is the case, the final outcome of the war and its duration will be decisively influenced. Even if the Soviet army achieves only a minor victory in this battle, it will not mean a complete loss of the war, because the Nazis' fate is not tied to this battle in the same way.

### Battle Situation Summary

Reuters, London, 5th: Today marks the 16th week of the Soviet-German War. According to reports from both sides and other war news, the battle situation on all fronts can be summarized as follows: (1) After six weeks of encirclement, the defenders of Leningrad are not only able to hold firm but also seize opportunities to counter-attack. According to Moscow dispatches, new Soviet tanks have joined the fighting in the area, which shows their determination. On the island of Hango, west of the city, German forces are also encountering strong Soviet resistance. The Soviet fleet claims that 16 small islands in the vicinity are now occupied by Soviet troops. (2) Moscow also reported today that Soviet forces have achieved new local victories in the central sector. When the Soviet army discovers the enemy's weakness, it launches counter-attacks at several locations simultaneously. The Nazis are attempting to stop the Soviet army with tanks, aircraft, and heavy artillery, but they are no match for the Soviet Air Force's fierce attacks and are retreating. The Soviet army is still pressing the enemy and attempting to reach their lines of communication. (3) The German forces in Ukraine have made the most progress. After 13 weeks of bloody fighting, they have captured Kiev. The situation in northern Ukraine is still quite critical. The German forces are now launching their main force toward Kharkiv, but the Soviet army will fight with all its might for every inch of land. (4) Since General Butny launched a large-scale counter-offensive in Crimea, there has been fierce fighting on the mainland north of the peninsula. The Soviet army is attacking Perekop from the northwest in an attempt to cut off the German forces fighting on the isthmus. The German side has apparently seen this danger and has therefore deployed a large number of reinforcements to join the fighting there. The Soviet naval air force is currently providing great assistance to the Crimean defenders. According to the Soviet Information Bureau, the total losses of the Soviet and German forces are as follows: (1) Soviet soldiers killed, wounded, and missing: 1,128,000 men, 7,000 tanks, 8,900 artillery pieces, and 5,300 aircraft. (2) German soldiers killed, wounded, and missing: over 3,000,000 men, 11,000 tanks, 13,000 artillery pieces, and 9,000 aircraft.

United Press, Moscow, 5th: The fate of the Soviet forces fighting desperately to defend the approaches to Crimea has not yet been announced today. High command only announced indirectly that the Red Army continued to resist on the entire front overnight, but Izvestia stated that the German 183rd Infantry Division and the 89th Regiment were annihilated while fighting in a certain sector of the western front. Soviet forces recovered nine villages occupied by German forces and seized vehicles, machinery, and military supplies. The Red Army is continuing to pursue the German forces.

Haitong News Agency, 5th, from the German Führer's Headquarters: The German military report this afternoon stated that the Eastern European war is progressing smoothly. In southern Ukraine, a German division is engaged in fierce fighting with entrenched Soviet forces. German forces cleared the remaining enemy forces south of the mouth of the Dnieper River and on small islands in the Black Sea, capturing 12,000 Soviet soldiers and seizing 34 tanks, 179 artillery pieces, and 472 machine guns. German troops captured the island of Abrulka. Finnish forces continue to advance in eastern Karelia. Last night, the German Air Force bombed important armaments factories southeast of Kharkiv and military installations in Moscow and Leningrad.

### German Offensive Near Murmansk Thwarted

TASS, 5th, from the Northern Front Near Murmansk: Near Murmansk, two German regiments forcibly crossed the Licha River and consolidated their defenses on the east bank in order to attack the ice-free port of Murmansk. The Red Army was ordered to attack, surrounded the enemy forces, and drove them out of the east bank. Under heavy Red Army artillery fire, the German 138th and 139th Regiments suffered heavy losses. Hundreds of German soldiers drowned while trying to escape during the river crossing. The 139th Regiment was almost completely wiped out, and its headquarters was also destroyed. The enemy suffered 1,500 dead and several thousand wounded. There are now no enemy traces on the east bank of the Licha River.

TASS, Moscow, 5th: A Pravda correspondent in Leningrad reported: "In this war to defend Leningrad, the Soviet tank units have made great contributions. Recently, in a village near Leningrad, Morozov's tank unit annihilated 150 enemies. Tanks led by Savelyev have also repeatedly attacked enemy positions. In tank battles, the Soviet Union has consistently demonstrated superior combat effectiveness. On one occasion, Rasumov's tank was attacked by three enemy tanks. Although the odds were greatly against him, he fought back bravely and eventually destroyed two enemy tanks, while the other retreated hastily."

Reuters, Moscow, 5th: A Pravda correspondent in Leningrad reported that the defenders of Leningrad are now using new types of tanks, which are formidable weapons, to counter the German mechanized forces, with considerable effect. These new weapons are manufactured in Leningrad itself and are still in production.

TASS, Stockholm, 5th: Military circles here say that General Leeb, commander of the German forces attacking Leningrad, has submitted his resignation to Hitler, but Hitler has rejected it because Leeb has not yet completed the tasks assigned by high command.

United Press, Moscow, 5th: Izvestia reported yesterday that, according to news from Leningrad, the Soviet army had won a major victory after fierce fighting near the town of Garrian-Ismails at point "B". This area is a key point on the German front line, and therefore the Soviet victory has eliminated the threat to Leningrad. The report also mentioned that Finnish forces have strengthened their defense lines to use as a base for attacking Soviet positions. It is reported that the Soviet army has carefully prepared a counter-offensive, using artillery to destroy Finnish machine gun emplacements, concrete bunkers, and bridges. Heavy tanks flattened defensive structures, and Finnish soldiers fled from burning houses. The report stated that the troops commanded by Major Pelsnok-Tsekai had captured an important area of the Finnish defenses. There was also fierce street fighting in the battle, and the Soviet army captured a large amount of war materiel.

### Large-Scale Soviet Counter-Offensive Launched in the Staryno Area

Reuters, London, 5th: Although recent German communiqués announced heavy aerial bombardments of Moscow and Leningrad on Friday, they remained vague about the large-scale war in progress, without mentioning any place names. Therefore, there is no way to confirm Hitler's prediction of a major battle on the Eastern Front. According to London sources, Soviet General Butny has launched a large-scale counter-offensive, moving out from the direction of Staryno, aimed at pinning down the German flanking offensive in Crimea. Although German forces have entered the southern end of the Perekop Isthmus, they have so far failed to reach the Crimean positions. The result of the current Soviet counter-offensive is unknown, but if it is successful, it will be a first-rate military tactic.

TASS, Moscow, 5th: The Red Army defending Odessa launched a counter-offensive against enemy forces near the city yesterday, achieving remarkable results. In addition to annihilating a large number of enemy troops, they also captured 45 artillery pieces and many machine guns.

TASS, Moscow, 5th: The Red Army on the Southwestern Front launches frequent attacks. In one sector, the Red Army inflicted heavy damage on an enemy motorized unit yesterday. The spoils of war included 500 military vehicles and 250 motorcycles. On the other hand, 650 enemy officers and soldiers were killed by landmines on the Southern Front.

TASS, Moscow, 5th: After several days of fierce fighting, the Red Army on the Southern Front inflicted heavy damage on the Romanian 8th Cavalry Brigade and the German 399th Infantry Regiment. The enemy suffered hundreds of casualties. Our army also captured three tanks, 20 artillery pieces, 30 machine guns, thousands of shells, and many other war supplies.

TASS, Moscow, 5th: Near Poltava on the Southern Front, the Soviet Air Force annihilated a battalion of enemy infantry and destroyed four enemy tanks and 44 trucks. In air combat, four German aircraft were destroyed. Also, in the N area, our air force annihilated two enemy transports and destroyed 45 military vehicles and six artillery pieces.

### Hull Condemns Germany After Sinking of "W. C. Teagle," "Lawless Like a Pirate," Must Be Dealt with from a Self-Defense Perspective

Reuters, Washington, 5th: Secretary of State Hull, while hosting reporters yesterday, specifically authorized reporters to relay his original words, saying, "The sinking of the "W. C. Teagle" appears to be a lawless, pirate-like act, aimed at intimidation. This kind of behavior is related to the general movement of expelling others from the Atlantic Ocean, and this movement is part of a world conquest movement." Hull answered reporters' questions, saying that regardless of what flag the "W. C. Teagle" flew, and regardless of whether it was under our escort, all countries have the inherent right to self-defense to deal with attacks aimed at conquering the world. In such extraordinary circumstances, acts that violate international law must be dealt with from a self-defense perspective. The United States must implement a policy of vigorously supplying Britain with what it needs. Every time a submarine sinks a ship carrying American supplies, the American aid-to-Britain policy is affected. If we were to say that the ships sunk were flying neutral flags, and therefore we could not take any action, then our aid-to-Britain policy would become a bubble. Secretary Hull made the above remarks in response to reporters' inquiries about the Standard Oil Company's claim that the "W. C. Teagle" was registered in Panama, but had been transferred to Britain, and that the ship was under British orders when it was torpedoed. Hull continued, saying that when aggressor nations move into certain new areas to conquer them, part of their plan is to seize control of the high seas, and then we recognize the right of all nations to self-defense. If such a plan succeeds, no country will be able to defend itself. Hull also said that he had not read Hitler's recent speech because he determined that there was absolutely nothing new in his speech, and that he could not at this time imitate his actions and make empty pronouncements. It is reported that the "W. C. Teagle," which encountered misfortune on its way from South America to South Africa, was the eighth American merchant ship to be sunk since the outbreak of the European war. News of this incident reached the American capital on the day that government leaders were trying to lobby Congress to amend the Neutrality Act.

Reuters, New York, 5th: It has just been learned that 34 of the 38 crew members of the American ship "W. C. Teagle," which was torpedoed in the Atlantic Ocean recently, have been rescued.

United Press, Washington, 5th: Secretary of State Hull said that the sinking of the "W. C. Teagle" by a torpedo on September 27 in the American neutrality zone was more serious than previous ship sinkings.

United Press, Washington, 5th: Administrative leaders stated yesterday that they firmly believe that the torpedo attack on the "W. C. Teagle" oil tanker strengthened President Roosevelt's determination to ask Congress to amend the Neutrality Act. Alabama Democratic Congressman Hill said that the sinking of the ship indicated the Nazis' clear determination to drag the Western Hemisphere into the war. This is another warning to our country. We should abandon all appeasement and take every possible step to defend our country.

### Large-Scale Bombing of Germany as Prelude to Invasion of Europe, Halifax Addresses Reporters for the First Time After Returning to Washington

Reuters, Washington, 5th: British Ambassador Halifax, after returning to his post from England, met with reporters for the first time yesterday. He expressed gratitude for American aid and described in detail the current state of British defenses and the reasons why Britain, in its current state, cannot invade the European continent. He said that the British, like the Americans, feel that Britain should take advantage of the three-month hiatus in German air activity in England to send troops to invade the European continent. However, current shipping and equipment are not sufficient to carry out such a large-scale operation. Now, the only option is to bomb Germany on a large scale to create conditions that will allow the war to end sooner. This is also the best way to reduce the pressure on the Soviet Union and prevent German fighters from being deployed entirely on the Soviet front. Therefore, the production of heavy bombers is of paramount importance. One bomber delivered this year is better than two or three delivered next year. As for Hitler's recent speech, he has not yet read it in full. He feels that Hitler's words are merely intended to boost German morale in preparation for the winter war. In fact, no one in London believes Hitler's claim that the war against the Soviet Union is proceeding according to plan.

### US President Schedules Meeting with Congressional Leaders Tomorrow to Discuss Amending or Repealing the Neutrality Act

Havas News Agency, Washington, 4th: Political figures here say that President Roosevelt is scheduled to meet with leading members of both the House and Senate in the White House on the 7th to discuss the issue of amending or repealing the Neutrality Act. Although this matter is of great importance, it is rumored that President Roosevelt has not yet made a final decision. It is believed that the President hopes that the House of Representatives will quickly pass other proposals that can be put forward in the future and that he is also preparing to make some concessions to the opposition. It is expected that the proposed amendment to the Neutrality Act, although not entirely to his liking, will at least require that the clause prohibiting the arming of American merchant ships be abolished. Both houses will generally agree to this. However, if the President requests that the clause prohibiting American merchant ships from sailing to belligerent ports and traveling in war zones also be abolished, the isolationists will inevitably rise up in opposition.

### British Troops Concentrated on Turkish Border

Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 5th: According to neutral reporters, who arrived here from Cairo via Beirut, many British troops are moving through Palestine and Syria toward the Turkish border. A large army, including Polish, Czech, Greek, Indian, Serbian, Dutch, and other nationalities of soldiers, has been concentrated in northern Syria.

### Taylor Returns to New York with Valuable Information

Reuters, New York, 5th: Roosevelt's personal envoy to the Vatican, Taylor, returned here yesterday. He told Reuters that he was carrying extremely valuable information, which he would report to the President and Secretary of State Hull. This information was obtained from his meetings with many relevant people overseas. It is believed that Taylor will visit the President at Hyde Park, as the President has come to New York for private matters and is now at his residence in Hyde Park.

British Aircraft Attack Military Targets

Reuters, London, 5th: The Air Ministry issued a communiqué yesterday describing the activities of the British Air Force on Friday night. It stated that British bombers attacked dockyards in Dunkirk, Rotterdam, Antwerp, and Brest last night, hitting their targets. British coastal aircraft also attacked targets such as the Aalborg airfield in Denmark. British fighters, during offensive patrols at dusk, attacked an enemy airfield in northern France with small cannons and machine gun fire. One British coastal aircraft is missing.

Reuters, Cairo, 5th: Recent British Air Force communiqués state that on the nights of Thursday and Friday, British heavy bombers again attacked the port and ships of Benghazi, and strafed enemy transport vehicles on the roads. Bardia was also subjected to continuous night attacks, causing large fires and significant damage. The city was also heavily bombed by the South African Air Force during the day. British fighters were also very active, engaging several German aircraft in the Sidi Barrani area and damaging several German aircraft. Four British aircraft are missing from the above-mentioned raids.

### Seven More Czechs Shot, Yugoslav Guerrillas Capture German Officers and Soldiers as Hostages

Reuters, London, 5th: German authorities are working hard to destroy all resistance in the occupied countries, so Nazi executioners and secret police have continued to work tirelessly in the past 24 hours. According to a wireless telegram from Prague, seven more Czechs have been executed recently, including former Prague Mayor Dr. Krabga, who, after being sentenced to death on Friday, preferred to be executed rather than beg for mercy. One of the seven was Colonel Balaban, whom the Germans considered to be a member of the revolutionary organization. Three of the seven were Jews, who were accused of hiding weapons and were all shot. Meanwhile, according to Vichy sources, six so-called communists in France have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to twenty years in Douai.

United Press, New York, 5th: CBS broadcast a British wireless message yesterday stating that Yugoslav guerrillas had captured 65 German soldiers, including at least 40 officers, and were holding them hostage. If the Germans continue to kill Yugoslavs, these German officers and soldiers will also be executed. The wireless message stated that, according to a telegram from Prague, five Polish school children have been sentenced to eight years of hard labor.

### German Overseas Chinese Arrive in Bulgaria

Haitong News Agency, Sofia, 5th: German overseas Chinese from Iran, led by the German Minister to Iran, arrived yesterday at the Bulgarian border town of Svirengrad. The Bulgarian Minister to Iran, the Hungarian Chargé d'Affaires to Iran, and embassy staff also arrived in Bulgaria. The Italian Minister and expatriates will arrive in the city today. The Bulgarian authorities have sent a special envoy to welcome them.

### German Military Announces Sinking Statistics

Reuter, Berlin, 5th - The German High Command announced that in September, a total of 682,000 tons of British merchant ships were sunk. Among them, German submarines sank 452,000 tons, torpedo boats sank 38,500 tons, and the air force sank 19,000 tons. The losses of Soviet merchant ships are not included. To date, the total number of British ships sunk has reached 10,230,000 tons, of which 75% were sunk by submarines. The Italian naval and air force attack on British ships in the Western Mediterranean was the most significant event of the past week. A British convoy, protected by the battleship HMS Nelson and other aircraft carriers and warships, was spotted by Italian reconnaissance aircraft near Sicily. The Italian naval and air forces immediately launched an attack, sinking two large merchant ships (3,000 tons). In addition, two heavy cruisers and one light cruiser were sunk by torpedoes. The battleship HMS Nelson was also hit by a torpedo and damaged. Another battleship, six cruisers, and one destroyer were also hit by torpedoes in succession. Eight Italian aircraft did not return. In another incident, a German submarine attacked a convoy in the Mediterranean, sinking twelve ships. In the Atlantic, a 12,000-ton oil tanker was sunk, followed by the sinking of three merchant ships and one oil tanker, totaling 28,000 tons. In addition, the German and Finnish navies actively laid minefields near Kronstadt.

### Iraqi Prime Minister Resigns

Reuter, 5th - A report from Beirut states that Iraqi Prime Minister Matfa has resigned. The Iraqi Ambassador to Egypt, Nori, has been summoned back to Baghdad and has departed by plane. It is noted that Mr. Matfa took office as Prime Minister in March of this year.

### Results of the Moscow Conference: Joint Strategy Decided; U.S. Aid to the Soviet Union to Become More Practical and Expanded; Soviet Union Regards the Conference as a Blow to Germany

TASS, London, 5th - British newspapers are focusing on the results of the Three-Power Conference. All evening papers carried the full text of Molotov's speech at the conference. The Standard Evening News headlined Molotov's speech with "Hitler's Plans Destroyed" and "Decisive Cooperation Between Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States." The News Chronicle's headline was "Molotov Vows to Fight to the End, Three Powers Will Defeat Hitler." All morning papers and diplomatic observers have written articles commenting on the resolutions of the Three-Power Conference. The News Chronicle's diplomatic observer, Clemence, said that the Moscow Conference has established a solid foundation for cooperation and has gained a broad new understanding. The Times stated that the main task now is to immediately implement the results that have been achieved. The paper pointed out that the close alliance of the three powers has hindered Hitler's conspiracy to defeat them one by one. According to The Times' diplomatic observer, the Moscow Three-Power Conference planned a strategy to achieve victory, namely, strengthening the Eastern front while applying pressure on Germany in other areas. The Daily Telegraph and the Morning Post wrote that the Moscow Conference will occupy an important page in history, as it has decided on a powerful joint strategy for the cooperating countries.

TASS, New York, 5th - American newspapers have widely commented on the Moscow Three-Power Conference. The Chicago Daily News' correspondent in Moscow, Steele, said that the conclusion of the conference was particularly swift and that, in addition to material cooperation, the conference has promoted new developments in the political relations of the three countries. The New York World-Telegram's correspondent in Washington, Schreiber, said that the heroism of the Russian resistance exceeded Hitler's and Germany's expectations, and the war has become protracted. American aid will influence the outcome. A Sunday newspaper's diplomatic correspondent said that the general opinion in Washington is in favor of providing the Soviet Union with the greatest possible assistance, and current aid measures to the Soviet Union are becoming more practical.

TASS, Moscow, 5th - The resolutions of the Soviet-British-American Three-Power Conference have been supported by all Soviet citizens. Personnel from various factories, companies, and institutions have held meetings to discuss the issue. The military and civilians in the Soviet Far East also welcomed the results of the Three-Power Conference. Red Army personnel Kartchkov said, "Hitler's Germany will soon feel the combined strength of the three powers. In all countries enslaved by fascism, anti-German movements are also expanding. The time for them to rise up and kill the enemy is approaching."

Reuter, Moscow, 5th - Soviet spokesman Lozovsky said yesterday that Hitler's speech on Friday was the clearest indication that the Moscow Three-Power Conference was a major blow to Germany. Hitler felt the need to speak to reassure the people. The most important point in his speech was Hitler's admission of an error in his assessment of Soviet strength. The German reaction to the Moscow Three-Power Conference is very interesting. After the Roosevelt-Churchill sea conference, German propaganda predicted that no further conference would follow. When the names of those attending the Moscow Conference were announced, German radio said that the attendees would inevitably clash. When the Moscow Conference formed a subcommittee, the Germans said that the conference would be bogged down in protracted procedures. Now that the conference has ended in just three days, the Germans have been spreading propaganda that the Moscow Conference has broken down, but at present, they cannot explain the establishment of an agreement between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. Unable to say anything else, Hitler is fabricating lies about how heavy the Soviet losses are, which is ridiculous.

The Asahi Shimbun's special dispatch from Manila stated that the purpose of the conference was to strengthen the encirclement of Japan. Both newspapers stated that those who participated in the conference included Brigadier General Magruder, head of the U.S. military delegation to China, Admiral McNair, commander of the U.S. Far East Forces, and Marshal Brooke-Popham, commander of the British Far East Forces.

### U.S. Defense Spending Greatly Increased; Accounts for 18% of National Income

Reuter, Washington, 5th - U.S. Budget Director Smith told reporters here yesterday that in the past three months, national income spent on national defense has accounted for over 14%, while in the past fiscal year, defense spending accounted for only 8% of national income. It is expected that in the near future, spending on national defense will reach 18% of national income. The latest estimate is $25 billion more than what was calculated a few months ago. The reason for the increase is the acceleration of defense construction, the rise in certain prices, and the allocation of new funds. According to his estimate, British war expenditure currently accounts for at least 40% of national income, while German war expenditure accounts for 50%. U.S. national income has increased significantly, so even while paying for defense expenditures, a great deal of money is still being used for civil expenses, which is much more than when the defense plan was not adopted. It is expected that by the spring of next year, defense spending will reach $2 billion per month. The total defense expenditure for the fiscal year ending June 1942 will total $18 billion, which does not include the $10 billion used by Britain. As for how much the total defense expenditure will be, Smith declined to comment due to the Lend-Lease program.

### Nomura Visits Hull, Expresses Willingness to Conclude an Agreement with the U.S.; Attempts to Restore Normal Shipping in the Far East

It is believed here that Tokyo's proposal is the first step towards restoring friendly relations between Japan and the U.S. The Japanese government apparently believes that restoring normal shipping is very important for a general understanding of the Pacific problem.

### Opportunity for Domestic Goods to Sell in Southeast Asia Has Arrived: Promote Trade with the Dutch East Indies, Economic Blockade of Japan by Britain and the United States Intensifies, Overseas Chinese Seize the Opportunity to Capture the Market, After the Interruption of American Cotton to Japan, Indian Cotton is Also Banned from Being Shipped

A certain gentleman, a prominent figure in the Chinese business community in the Dutch East Indies, who recently came to Shanghai, told reporters yesterday, "The Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have already organized the Sino-Dutch Trade Promotion Committee in order to vigorously promote domestic goods. In order to protect local products, the Dutch East Indies authorities have implemented import restrictions. Moreover, due to the recent freezing of Japanese assets, Japanese goods can no longer be dumped in the Dutch East Indies. This measure is beneficial to our country. It is hoped that domestic goods manufacturers can seize this good opportunity and redouble their efforts to capture the Southeast Asian domestic goods market."

Seize the Opportunity to Compete in the Market

The gentleman continued, "As for Sino-Dutch trade, we cannot deny that China in the past was neither agricultural nor industrial. Agricultural products relied on imports, and industrial products were also rarely exported. On the other hand, the Dutch East Indies is rich in agricultural products, with abundant coal, oil, and tin mines. The only things it relies on foreign countries for are foreign goods and cloth. However, in the past, China could not compete with Japan in these two areas. Therefore, the Dutch East Indies had a trade surplus with China every year. Now that Japanese goods can no longer be shipped to the Dutch East Indies, domestic goods manufacturers must make good use of this great opportunity, especially in the area of cotton textiles. They must strive to improve quality and increase production. Then the Dutch East Indies market can be obtained easily. The establishment of the Sino-Dutch Trade Promotion Committee is for this purpose."

Economic Severance between Britain, America, and Japan

According to the Japanese "Mainland News", the economic blockade against Japan is becoming increasingly intensified, which has given a shock to the Shanghai economic community. When Britain issued the order to freeze Japanese assets, general observations were quite flexible. Indian cotton, with an annual output of five million dan, was still exported to Japan as usual because it was not applicable to all Indian and British textile machines. However, now it has been banned from being exported to Japan, and the Indian government has announced a permit system for exports to Japan. Therefore, it is not optimistic to say that Indian cotton is imported. As far as the current situation is concerned, it is contrary to the original ideal, making it difficult for Indian cotton to be transported to Japan. Now that the Indian government's opinion is consistent with the strong attitude of the British mainland, it has been determined. At the current stage when the hope of importing American cotton has been cut off, the import of Indian cotton has also been completely cut off. Therefore, what methods will those who need a large amount of cotton cloth in the future use? This is quite difficult."

The Strength of Overseas Chinese is Extremely Substantial

He continued to describe the current situation of Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, saying, "The position of the Dutch East Indies in Southeast Asia is more important than Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand. Although the number of local Overseas Chinese is small, their economic strength is greater. Therefore, the local government also attaches great importance to our Overseas Chinese. Although the economic strength of Overseas Chinese is great, they also have many shortcomings. The unsoundness of institutions and the lack of new commercial knowledge make it difficult to cope with modern commercial competition. Looking around the whole territory, there is no large enterprise company with a capital of one hundred and several million yuan, and the knowledge of the local people is increasing day by day. If Overseas Chinese do not seek improvement, their past superior position will be destroyed in one day. Therefore, the establishment of the Sino-Dutch Trade Promotion Committee is necessary."

Ardently Hope that the Motherland Will Surely Win and Succeed

Finally, when reporters asked about the expectations of Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies for their motherland, it was said that they have the same feelings as Overseas Chinese in other places. First of all, they hope that the motherland will surely win and succeed so that the status of Overseas Chinese will be further improved. They also hope that the authorities can treat returned Overseas Chinese well and protect them properly. Because Overseas Chinese work hard and endure hardship abroad, they want to seek a comfortable life or return home to invest when they return to their country in their later years. Therefore, they hope that the security of the motherland will be improved to guarantee them. In addition, Overseas Chinese are far away from the motherland and are inevitably alienated from the domestic situation. If they want Overseas Chinese capital to move inland, there should be a perfect guidance agency. For example, Hong Kong is a transportation hub for Overseas Chinese to enter and exit. If an agency dedicated to serving Overseas Chinese can be established in Hong Kong to connect the news between the two places, the situation can be changed."

### Gradey: Rumors of a Visit to Shanghai

Dr. Gradey, Assistant Secretary of State of the United States, who is currently stranded in Chongqing and is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong today, will attend the Tripartite Financial Conference in Hong Kong after visiting the central authorities in Chongqing to further strengthen the economic cooperation between the three allied countries and the United States. Before coming to China, Gradey's itinerary originally included a visit to Shanghai after visiting Chongqing to meet with American officials here, investigate economic conditions, and strengthen the effectiveness of sanctions against the Axis powers. Therefore, Gradey may visit Shanghai after the Tripartite Financial Conference. Gradey was ordered to come to the Far East on August 12 to investigate the economy, arriving in Manila by plane from San Francisco. According to sources, Gradey's mission this time is to investigate the pressure exerted by the entire democratic countries on the Axis powers in the Far East, so that the ABCD four powers can strengthen and complete their military defense ties and transport the raw materials of the East to various democratic countries to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Axis powers. Therefore, the Dutch East Indies, Malaysia, Burma, India, Ceylon, Hong Kong, Chongqing, and Shanghai are all on the list of inspections.

### British Electric Organization Secretly Checks Tickets

According to news obtained by the Pingming News Agency reporters yesterday, in order to resolutely stop ticket fraud, the British Electric Car Company has specially instructed several foreign senior staff members to organize a secret inspection team of two or three people each. These personnel have special privileges and can stop the tram at any time, regardless of whether the tram is in motion, and board it to check tickets. If fraud is found, they will be punished according to company rules. It is also learned that the ticket sellers of various trams of the Electric Car Company have seen a reduction in fraud since the incident in which ticket seller Wang Wanxiang pushed and killed Xiang Dongchuan, which caused public outrage and unanimous criticism.

### General Patrol Bowen Will Return to Shanghai Next Spring: Resignation is Not a Fact, Acting General Patrol Smith Specifically Denied Yesterday

Since the death of Special Deputy General Patrol Akagi, who was assassinated, and General Patrol Bowen was on vacation traveling in Canada, the Japanese side has requested the Public Works Bureau to reorganize the police department and expand the authority of the Japanese Deputy General Patrol in an attempt to work side by side with the General Patrol. In order to echo this, the Japanese newspapers quickly promoted that Bowen had resigned and would not return to Shanghai to cancel his vacation. Deputy General Patrol Acting General Patrol Smith said that this was not true and specifically made a statement yesterday to deny it in order to correct the record. It is said, "The recent rumor that General Patrol Bowen has resigned is not true as far as I know. Bowen will definitely return to Shanghai to cancel his vacation by March 17 at the latest. He has no reason to resign and has nothing to do with the special deputy general patrol issue. In the past, all the general patrols have had long vacations and travels. It is unimaginable to say that this is a resignation. The issue of the special deputy general patrol is centered on the authority of the position and is currently being negotiated between the authorities and the Japanese Consulate General."

### Banks Cooperate to Handle Trust Deposits: Guiding Hot Money to Move Inland is Becoming Increasingly Urgent, Deposit Interest is Generous and Dividends Are Given

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the banking community yesterday that since Britain and the United States froze Chinese funds and the Exchange Stabilization Fund eliminated the black market in Shanghai, the Shanghai exchange market has completely changed. The legal tender exchange rate has been officially set at 5.34375 yuan. All industries that need foreign exchange for legitimate needs can apply to the Exchange Stabilization Fund. After approval, they can exchange foreign exchange. Therefore, the Shanghai exchange market has actually entered the management stage, which is completely different from the free trading of the past. Since foreign exchange transactions have been restricted, it is impossible for abundant hot money to speculate on foreign exchange. Therefore, the way out for Shanghai's hot money has become a major issue.

Guiding Inward Movement is More Urgent Than Before

In the past, the maintenance of the Shanghai legal tender exchange rate was to suppress Shanghai's prices, consolidate the credibility of the legal tender, and indirectly prevent the soaring of prices in the interior due to the economic ties between Shanghai and the interior. Although foreign exchange speculation is no longer possible after the freezing, a large amount of hot money has shifted its target and hoarded goods, and the situation is no less serious than before. Prices in the interior have also been affected. Only by encouraging the movement of hot money inward can prices be suppressed. Therefore, the problem of hot money moving inward is as important as the maintenance of the black market in the past and is even more urgent than before. The four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture have formulated preferential guarantee measures for the movement of hot money inward and are doing their best to handle it.

Banks Have Cooperated Fully

Since this year, some hot money in Shanghai, in view of the unpredictable international situation, has automatically moved inward. As of June, it has reached 85 million yuan, of which April had the most, reaching 30 million yuan. However, the amount of hot money remaining in Shanghai is still huge, totaling 300 million yuan. If it cannot be guided properly, the prices in Shanghai and the interior will be unimaginable in the future. Now all banks are deeply aware of this and have cooperated fully with the government to absorb trust deposits, which will be used by the government in the inland industry. In addition to guaranteeing generous interest rates, depositors will also be given dividends. The funds entrusted for lending will be remitted from Shanghai to the interior and given a premium, and the full amount of legal tender can be collected in the interior upon maturity.

### Refugee Relief Fund is Insufficient: Scattering Fee to be Increased Starting This Month

Since the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has been actively scattering refugees from its various reception centers. As of now, it has reduced from more than 19,000 people to more than 13,000 people. According to the staff of the association, the high cost of living in the city is the biggest reason why the scattering work of the association cannot proceed as scheduled. Because the general refugees are deeply afraid of having no food or shelter once they leave the center, most of them are unwilling to leave.

Relief Fund Doubled The number of refugees currently accommodated by the association has been reduced by more than 6,000 compared with the beginning of this year, but the cost of relief for refugees has to be increased by more than one-half due to rising prices. At the beginning of this year, the average cost for each refugee was set at 10 yuan in national currency, but now it has increased to 16 yuan in national currency. Therefore, the relief for more than 13,000 refugees still requires more than 200,000 yuan per month. The income and expenditure of donations from various places cannot offset each other. Therefore, the citizen group of the association is now trying to raise funds to make up for it.

Incentivizing Departure

Starting this month, in order to encourage refugees to leave the center voluntarily, the association has increased the scattering fee. It is stipulated that adults who leave voluntarily will be given a scattering fee increased from 33 yuan to 50 yuan, an increase of 17 yuan. Children will be given a scattering fee increased from 25 yuan to 38 yuan. It is expected that this measure may encourage some refugees to leave voluntarily. According to the reporter of the Dazhong News Agency, the association has a total of twelve reception centers, including two women and children reception centers, two children reception centers, one disabled reception center, one elderly reception center, and the remaining six centers are for accommodating refugees who are adults and women and children living together.

### Two American Ships to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow

According to news from the shipping industry, two more American ships will arrive here one after another soon. The first ship is the President Coolidge of the American President Lines, which will arrive here for the second time from San Francisco, Honolulu, Little Luzon, and Hong Kong tomorrow. This ship is coming to Shanghai with sufficient cabin space for American expatriates staying in Shanghai. The Coolidge is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for one week and then set sail back to the United States. The other ship, the freight ship "Aleiva", represented by the local Fulai Foreign Company, will also arrive in Shanghai directly from Seattle on the 7th of this month. It is reported that the "Aleiva" has a deadweight of 6,551 tons and a net weight of 4,100 tons. It is one of the medium-sized merchant ships among the 200 merchant ships built by the 77th US Congress. It is said that it also carries a large batch of American goods this time.

### Procedure for Obtaining American Passport is Simplified

The Yulin West News reported that it was learned yesterday that the procedure for obtaining an American passport has been simplified. If the applicant can first obtain a passport from the Canadian immigration authorities and present proof documents issued by the British Consulate, they can obtain a transit passport in this port. According to well-informed sources, this method only applies to people traveling to Canada via the United States and to British and Canadian citizens, and does not apply to applicants immigrating to or traveling to the United States. This newly revised procedure makes passport visas much faster and authorizes the American authorities in this port to issue the necessary passports to people who have proof documents issued by the British authorities in this port.

### Soviet Overseas Chinese Donate Money to Comfort the Troops: British Women Assist

According to the Soviet agency in Shanghai for collecting donations to comfort the troops, as of the 4th of this month, it has received a total of 15,000 yuan in Chinese legal currency and other comforting items, mostly donated by Soviet Overseas Chinese groups. There are also a large number of items such as soap, cigarettes, and socks, mostly donated by poor Russian expatriates. The Moscow Bank has also abandoned receiving 130,000 yuan of comfort money.

Clothes Transported to the Soviet Union

The Russian Daily News published that 1,000 pairs of socks and 1,000 pieces of underwear will now be transported from Shanghai to the front-line Red Army to keep them warm. All Soviet Red Cross Society's soliciting and comforting goods committee will try to transport them to Hong Kong and then transfer them to Suzhou. Those who transport comfort goods here include Chinese, British, American, Russian, French, Polish, Australian, and German Jewish refugees. In addition to the Moscow Bank, the Russian Daily News and the Soviet Union Club in Shanghai accept donations. Every little bit helps, and it is hoped that all walks of life will donate.

British Women Sympathize

The British Women's Association sympathizes with the Soviet Red Army for fighting against aggression and defending the territory. Since the weather is already in the dead of winter and snow has fallen in the Soviet Union, the front-line Red Army needs winter clothes to protect themselves from the cold. Therefore, they also wrote to the Russian Daily News, stating that the association is launching a campaign to solicit comfort goods and is also raising underwear, socks, and other items to assist the Soviet Red Cross Society in collecting enough.

### Coal Ball Prices Have Fallen

The market prices of various smoke white coal, lump coal, and cinder in Shanghai are hovering, and it is difficult to be rampant. The coal ball factory's disk has opened as low as 315-6 yuan per ton, but there are still few inquiries. In particular, the coal ball business of various firewood and charcoal firms is only half of what it used to be. The reason is that after the coal ball price broke a new record, various users have saved money or switched to burning kerosene and firewood.

### Foreign Merchants in Shanghai Receive Letters from Branches: Recalling Before and After the Recapture of Fuzhou: A Large Number of Tea Leaves and Warehouse Goods Have Been Lost: American Consul's Car Hit by 18 Bullets

The "Zi Lin Bao" reported that a certain foreign merchant firm in Fuzhou sent a letter to the Shanghai firm on September 8, stating that when the Japanese army withdrew from Fuzhou, they took away all the goods stored in various warehouses. When American Consul Wright and Mr. Bixu Pu of the Christian Church drove through the city, they were strafed by a Japanese plane. Fortunately, they were not injured. The letter said in brief:

Missing Goods Worth Millions

On August 27, it was heard that the Japanese army had entered Sandu'ao, and some goods stored in the Asiatica Oil Company's godown in that port, and boxed tea leaves stored in the surrounding areas, worth millions of yuan, had been lost. On August 28 and 29, all the goods stored in the Qingji Tea godown were transported away. At 6 pm on the 29th, the Japanese army completely withdrew from the Nantai district. At 1 am on August 30, a fire suddenly broke out in a village on the outskirts of the city. Nearby fire trucks rushed to put out the fire, but were blocked by the Japanese army's cordon. At 9 am on the same day, the Japanese army withdrew from the Japanese schools and clubs next to the Asiatica Oil Company. Before leaving, they dismantled and took away all the wood from the doors, windows, tables, chairs, and floors in the house. From August 3 to September 2, a large number of goods were continuously loaded onto ships at the new dock across the river and transported down the river. At 2 pm on September 2, the Japanese army traveled down the river on 38 steamships, and several fishing boats carried Japanese Chinese along with them. It was known that the Japanese army was indeed withdrawing, because the Chinese army was heavily gathered at the foot of the mountains on the outskirts of the city, and it was extremely difficult for the Japanese army to cope. At about 1:30 am on September 2.

Militia Fiercely Fought Explosions in the City

The Japanese garrison near the Fuzhou! Gate was surrounded by the vanguard of the Chinese army (militia). A fierce battle ensued. At 4:30 am, a violent explosion occurred in the city. The reason was unknown. It was probably the signal set by the Japanese to order the rearguard troops to retreat to the new wharf for the final retreat. At 9:30 am, a Japanese ship in the river sounded its whistle three times and sped towards Mawei with troops. At 10 am, there was no Japanese soldier in Fuzhou and Nantai. At the same time, the militia poured into the city from all sides, numbering thousands. They were the vanguard of the regular army, many of whom were Fuzhou students. At about 11:30 am on September 3.

Bullets Entered the Carriage and Hit the Key

American Consul Wright and Mr. Bixu Ai of the Christian Church drove past the, on their way to visit Pastor Hua Lin, the principal of the high school outside Ximen. Suddenly, they were strafed by a Japanese seaplane. Although there were no markings on the car, there were only six cars left in Fuzhou, all of which were owned by foreigners. Eighteen bullets hit the car. One bullet penetrated the carriage and hit a bunch of keys in the trouser pocket of Bishi, the driver, grazing his body. The two were fortunate not to suffer other injuries. After a short pause, they drove forward and met Bi Lin. They learned that Bi's school had also been strafed. It was heard that the Japanese army had withdrawn from Mawei that afternoon, but thick smoke was seen billowing from the direction of the Mawei Arsenal. It was soon learned that the arsenal had been burned down that morning, and the residence of the naval academy's naval general and supervisor and other residences in the mountains behind the arsenal had also been burned down. The main force of the Japanese army retreated from Mawei towards Jianfeng at 9:30 am, leaving only one transport ship to wait for the Japanese army withdrawing from Fuzhou. As soon as the Japanese army withdrew, the residents of Mawei returned home. Two hours later, two Japanese seaplanes flew low and strafed, and dropped four bombs on the crowded market area, killing more than 20 people and seriously injuring more than 30 people. Dr. Jillette of the hospital in that area did his best to treat them. Many of the seriously injured died. The residents of Mawei said that the first attack by the Japanese plane was because they refused to set off firecrackers when the Japanese army withdrew. In the evening.

Welcoming the Militia with Firecrackers

People gathered in the mountains and on the streets of, welcoming the orderly militia and giving them gifts of tea, meals, and paper, and the sound of firecrackers was incessant. The party flag was flying everywhere, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic. At 8 am the next morning, Japanese seaplanes bombed and strafed the old county government and barracks in Dongjie. At 10:30 am, two more Japanese seaplanes flew from Mawei and strafed, but there were no casualties. Then, three Japanese land twin-engine bombers scattered leaflets in the city and then went to Guling, where the seaplanes dropped four bombs before flying towards Mawei. On the night of the day and the 3rd and 4th, the firefighters automatically patrolled the streets to maintain order. Military officers also visited the city one after another. From the 4th, the city situation returned to calm.

### The Bodyguard and Driver of Ji Juemi Arrested for Stealing Documents; Two Others Arrested and Released; Incident Due to Misunderstanding, Ji Does Not Intend to Prosecute

The Times reports that seven hours after the death of Luo Jialing, the wife of Jewish tycoon Silas Hardoon, the bodyguard of Ji Juemi, compradore of Hardoon & Co., was arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department in connection with the theft of important documents from Hardoon & Co. at 221 Nanjing Road. The bodyguard was still detained at the Central Police Station last night and has not yet been publicly prosecuted.

Entered the House and Stole Documents

The removal of the documents occurred between 10:30 PM and 11:00 PM on Friday (the 3rd). At that time, there were three Chinese, one of whom was identified as Ji's bodyguard, and another as his chauffeur, who took the opportunity to sneak into the Hardoon & Co. office. Two employees were inside, already asleep. The watchman heard a noise and got up to investigate, immediately reporting it to nearby detectives, and stating that he witnessed three people throwing a paper package from the back window onto the roof of a neighboring building. The three then jumped from the window onto the roof of the neighboring building and escaped by car.

The Three Arrested Released

Afterward, an informant rushed to Ji Juemi's Hardoon Villa on Jing'an Temple Road, met with Mr. Ji, and then returned to the original location, bringing the bodyguard, chauffeur, and a Chinese person to the Central Police Station. After questioning, the three led the police to a neighboring building of Hardoon & Co., produced a paper package, with a special symbol stamped on it, which was rumored to be important documents related to the Hardoon estate. The paper package was kept by the police last night. The two Chinese were detained overnight and released yesterday morning (the 4th).

Incident Due to Misunderstanding, Lawsuit Withdrawn

However, according to reliable police officers, the bodyguard was still detained at the police station yesterday. According to another senior police officer, the matter has now been clarified as a misunderstanding, so the bodyguard will be released immediately, and all documents returned to Ji. It is said that Ji had sent the three to the Hardoon office to retrieve the documents, which were previously the responsibility of Ji to keep. Now that Ji has not filed a lawsuit, the case will naturally be withdrawn.

Estate Dispute Intensifying

The Hardoon & Co. office was protected by police officers sent by the police station yesterday, and the police officers stationed on the Hardoon property have been increased. Recently, ten people claiming to be relatives of Hardoon have demanded to inherit Hardoon's estate of 43.7 million yuan. This case has intensified due to the death of Mrs. Luo Jialing. Mr. Okamoto, the lawyer handling the case, previously stated that Luo Jialing did not respond to his letters, and only found out the reason on Friday. According to Mr. Okamoto, he and the assistant lawyer Hicks sent a letter yesterday to inquire about the client's future steps in the case.

Luo's Body Embalmed Yesterday

It is also learned that Luo Jialing's body was embalmed yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM at the Aili Garden following Buddhist rituals. Yesterday, those who came to pay their respects, from morning to night, were endless. Organizations included the Chinese Buddhist Association, the Buddhist Laymen's Forest, the Shanghai Orphanage Band, and the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association. The authorities also sent seven Chinese and Western Indian police officers to provide close protection. It is heard that the funeral will be held this Wednesday, and the burial will be next to Hardoon's tomb in the garden. According to a reporter from Dazhong News Agency, the Leshan Tongren Society, which Mrs. Luo presided over during her lifetime, will continue to operate. It is also heard that the adopted children will continue Mrs. Luo's wishes and establish a university in the garden to cultivate talents. According to reports, Mrs. Luo once founded Huayan University, which was later renamed Cangsheng Mingzhi University, but was later closed for some reason.

### Labor Unrest in the Printing Industry; Continued Disturbances

Since the outbreak of labor unrest among parts workers in the local printing industry, the number of incidents of striking workers harassing various printing houses has been increasing day by day. Although some workers have been arrested by the police on the spot, the labor side's harassment has not been curbed. At around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, Lu Fuchang, a worker from the Xinsheng Printing House on Datong Road, was arrested while distributing leaflets in front of the Chengye Printing House. It is also learned that more than ten companies, including Chunhua Printing House in Gaoshou Lane on Shanxi Road, Lichang on Qipu Road, and Yongfa on Haining Road, have had striking workers go to persuade them to stop working, resulting in serious conflicts. Several workers were also arrested at that time. In addition, the Shenjiang Printing House on Fuxing Road and several other companies have also had conflicts when striking workers went to persuade them to stop working, resulting in heavy losses.

### A Beggar Snatches Food; A Woman is Run Over and Killed

Ms. Liu Wang, a 54-year-old woman from Ningbo, had her mooncake snatched by a beggar in front of 343 Fade Road on the night of the 1st of this month. Ms. Wang went to chase after him and was hit and killed by Tram No. 10 of the French Concession. Details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that the police authorities have investigated and found that the tram driver was not at serious fault at the time of the accident, and the blame lies with the deceased herself. However, the family of the deceased is poor, so they have temporarily borrowed money for the funeral and plan to go to the police station today to request negotiations with the tram company, demanding considerable compensation and a consolation payment to repay the funeral debt.

### Pregnant Woman Going to Hospital by Rickshaw; Fetus Falls Out on the Way

Ms. Liu Li, a 23-year-old Cantonese woman living at 19 Kangti Road, whose husband works as a professional on a foreign ship, was left alone in Shanghai. Recently, due to being full-term in her pregnancy, she was unable to afford a doctor for delivery due to poverty. Therefore, at 7:00 AM on the 4th, she was accompanied by Chen Li, who lived with her, to take a rickshaw to the Zhongde Hospital to await delivery. Due to the bumpiness of the road, the fetus was shaken out in front of 216 Malang Road, and the pregnant woman also fainted in the rickshaw. A policeman saw it, reported it to the police station, and sent a detective to investigate. The pregnant woman Liu Li was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but the male infant who fell out had already died. The infant's body was sent to the coroner's office to await examination.

### Fire Suddenly Broke Out at a Japanese Warehouse in Hongkou Yesterday Morning; Heavy Losses and Spread to Neighboring Houses; Extinguished by Firefighters After Four Hours

At about 4:18 AM yesterday morning, a large fire suddenly broke out at a Japanese warehouse at 97 Haining Road. At that time, the fire was extremely fierce. After receiving the news, the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade immediately dispatched many fire trucks to the rescue, but because the warehouse contained mostly mats and rice used by the Japanese, as well as other flammable Japanese daily necessities, it was impossible to put out the fire for a while. The flames shot up into the sky and became uncontrollable. As a result, it also spread to the neighboring lumber warehouse and the Jinggong Box Factory, and these lumber and cardboard boxes were also easily flammable materials, so it was not extinguished by firefighters until about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, lasting a total of three and a half hours. The total loss this time was quite large, and it is learned that when fighting the fire, a Russian firefighter, Snail Weiqu, fell and injured his back and right hand due to his brave rescue efforts. He was sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment. The cause of the fire is under investigation by the police.

Another Fire in Hongkou

It is also learned that at about 7:34 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in a garage at 1-61, Lane 729, North Sichuan Road, for unknown reasons. It is heard that the garage contained wooden furniture, some white rice, and a new Chevrolet car with registration number 5809, all of which were burned. The fire was extinguished after a quarter of an hour.

### Provisional Pork Prices Set by the French Concession Evaluation Committee

### News about Zou Mengchan's Calligraphy and Seal Carving

Zou Mengchan, a famous calligrapher and seal carver, has been immersed in the study of epigraphy and philology for over thirty years. He has a deep understanding of the classics, histories, and philosophical works, and has completed a collection of annotations on Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals. In the past, Zhonghua Book Company admired his name and hired him to compile the Cihai dictionary, where he made many definitive judgments on old words. His calligraphy is excellent in all styles from great and small seal script to clerical script, and is both ancient and simple, far beyond what modern people can imitate. His seal carving follows the style of Qin Ying, and is free from the vulgarity of modern times, carving gold and cutting jade, directly entering the room of the ancients. It is heard that Mr. Zou has recently released two types of seal collections, lithographic prints are two yuan per volume, and original rubbings are forty yuan per set. The consignment point is Xiling Seal Society on Guangdong Road in this city. Those who want to obtain Mr. Zou's calligraphy and seal carvings can contact the society or Rongbaozhai on Henan Road.

### Waste Production (Continued from Yesterday)

— Fu Gui

Special Visit to the Handicraft Relief Society

Obligatory School and Paradise for Refugee Children

The society also pays attention to the education of refugee workers' children, using the original school buildings of the boys' and girls' sections of the Qingxin Middle School at Dananmen to establish an obligatory primary school and a kindergarten. There are 450 students in the primary school and 50 in the kindergarten. Most of the students are children of refugee workers, and street children are also admitted as much as possible. At the same time, adult literacy classes are attached, divided into morning and evening classes, so that illiterate refugee workers and nearby poor illiterate people have the opportunity to study. The above-mentioned schools are completely free, and lunch is provided. In addition, all stationery and books have a special feature worth mentioning, that is, all the things used by the teachers and students of the school are donated waste. Broken pens and waste paper are all reused, but the results are not inferior because of this. The reporter once visited the teachers' lounge and saw student essays and art papers displayed in glass cabinets. The front is words and paintings, and the back is clearly used bills, which are mass-donated by a Western restaurant in Puyi bags. Most of the teachers in the school are also from refugee worker families, so they are more diligent in serving their alma mater and regard it as the work they are most willing to undertake.

Children's Canteen About to Run Out of Food

The free canteen set up in the school provides lunch for hundreds of children every day. In the past, it relied entirely on rice and wheat donated by the American Red Cross, and at the same time used the remainder to relieve the nearby elderly, weak, and refugees. The dishes are supplied by the society's affiliated refugee worker farm. Since the reduction in the number of American ships coming from Shanghai, the American Red Cross rice and wheat have been declared to no longer be shipped from next month, which is a fatal blow. It is said that after the implementation of the frozen funds, the economic assistance from the American church is also becoming increasingly difficult. Under the dual crisis, poor children are about to run out of food and cannot get a free lunch after studying in peace. This is such a serious fact that it needs material help and salvation from people in the society!

(Note) Puyi Handicraft Society has an office on the second floor of 115 Hankou Road in the Public Concession.

### Shanghai's Life and Death (Roundtable Discussion)

Date of Roundtable Discussion: October 2, 1941, starting at 1:00 PM

Location of Roundtable Discussion: Inside the Internal and External Political and Economic Translation Agency

A war between Japan and the United States is inevitable. Negotiations before the gunfire are just a preparation that should be made to delay the time before the slaughter, right? If Japan and the United States go to war, is Shanghai finished? If there is no war, can Shanghai continue to maintain this situation for a long time? Many people believe that the key to determining Shanghai's future lies in the local politics; but in fact, the transportation problem is even more important. This is the unanimous opinion of the three of us in this roundtable discussion; this article is the conclusion of this roundtable discussion. Is it true or is it false? We question the experts. We believe that this is not a matter of intelligence seeing intelligence, and benevolence seeing benevolence, which can be perfunctorily passed off; it is a matter of life and death for Shanghai and the people of Shanghai. Looking forward to the future, it seems that there are not many days left; how can we then be able to do it?

### Is Politics More Important than Transportation? Or is Transportation More Important than Politics?

Where does the key to Shanghai's future lie? If we leave aside the political issue, then it should be the cargo transportation problem. In fact, even from a political point of view: whether or not foreign transportation can be maintained? The relationship is also very important. Because if British and American ships continue to come to Shanghai, then the relationship between Britain and the United States and Shanghai can also be strengthened. Of course: if British and American ships stop coming to Shanghai, it does not mean that Britain and the United States have abandoned Shanghai or withdrawn from Shanghai. But under this situation, that is, when Shanghai's foreign transportation becomes a problem, Shanghai's political situation may not be the same as it is now, right? This is to say: Shanghai's foreign transportation problem can also determine Shanghai's political situation. However, Shanghai's political situation will not determine Shanghai's foreign transportation problem. The key to determining Shanghai's foreign transportation problem is not in Shanghai's political situation, but in the world's political situation. If the international political situation does not change, then no matter what pressure Shanghai's political situation is under, Britain and the United States will never stop their ships from coming to Shanghai, and may even have the opposite effect. Because Shanghai is the last fortress of Britain and the United States in the Far East, they will never change their fixed policy due to any situation that occurs locally. Therefore, we can say that the key to Shanghai's future lies in the problem of Shanghai's foreign cargo transportation, and Shanghai's local political situation is not as important as the average person imagines. It doesn't seem to be arbitrary, right?

What Happens When Shanghai's Transportation is Cut Off

Why is the cargo transportation problem so decisive for Shanghai's future? The reason is very simple: especially in the economic aspect. Let me explain:

(1) Although Shanghai has become an isolated island, it is still acting as a part of the national territory's collection and distribution center. The products of the occupied areas are swallowed and exhaled here; even the supply and demand of materials in the rear areas are partially swallowed and exhaled here. Even those inside and outside Japan rely on the transfer in and out of the port of Shanghai, and the number is even greater. However, the condition for completing this collection and distribution task is cargo transportation. Once foreign transportation stagnates, Shanghai's economic position will completely change, which is obvious.

(2) Although Shanghai is the largest commercial port in the Far East, it is also a major industrial city. China's export native products are processed and manufactured in Shanghai. Imported raw materials are refined in Shanghai. The country's largest national textile industry and flour industry, as well as all light industries and simple machinery and tool manufacturing industries, are concentrated in Shanghai. However, whether it is native raw materials or imported raw materials, if the supply to Shanghai is stopped once, Shanghai's entire industrial structure will completely collapse. And the supply of these raw materials to Shanghai takes cargo transportation as its prerequisite.

(3) Shanghai's prosperity in recent years is not based on the wartime boom, but on the evil consequences of the war. The wartime boom is based on the need for materials for the war; and Shanghai's prosperity completely relies on the concentration of population and floating capital. Because of the concentration of population, the needs of daily necessities and the commercial relations are thriving. Because of the concentration of floating capital, speculative business is flourishing. If overseas transportation is stopped, and the supply of daily necessities is suspended, the concentrated population will inevitably disperse; and the floating capital will also disperse, and investment business will also decline. And the decline of speculative business can also accelerate the dispersion of the population. The current market in Shanghai can be said to be completely supported by speculative business.

There Are Three Ridiculous Thoughts

Now there is a group of so-called people who indulge in fantasy. They believe that if Shanghai falls into a completely occupied situation due to the opening of the Pacific War, Shanghai's existing economic structure will not stop. One reason is that Japanese ships replace British and American merchant ships in entering and exiting, and the second reason is that Japan has an absolute need for Shanghai's production equipment. There is another batch of delusions, thinking that in order to continue to obtain overseas material supplies, Japan may let Shanghai be in a neutral position. At that time, Shanghai's situation will certainly become another kind of appearance, but it is not the scene of the destruction of Great Shanghai. Putting aside this slave mentality, just linking it with the decisive nature of transportation to Shanghai's future, that is to say: the decisive factor for Shanghai's future is not the transportation problem, but the political problem.

### Dead Port, Deserted Island, Abandoned Wharf - The Destruction of Great Shanghai

Even If There Are Ships, There Will Be No Goods to Transport

We do not deny that the political issues are more decisive for Shanghai than the transportation issues. But no matter what, Shanghai's local political issues will not change Shanghai's foreign transportation situation: unless the entire international situation changes, it will affect Shanghai's foreign transportation. If Shanghai's foreign transportation conditions change, then Shanghai's situation may become the kind of appearance that those fantasists are fantasizing about. But unfortunately, once there is a problem with foreign transportation, those fantasized situations will not save the destruction of Great Shanghai. The destruction of Great Shanghai by artillery fire may not appear in the future Pacific War, but it is very possible that Great Shanghai will be suffocated to death due to the stagnation of transportation. The matter is very clear: since Britain and the United States are at war with Japan, then the materials of Britain and the United States and their territories will naturally no longer be supplied to areas under Japanese control, and Shanghai will not be an exception. At that time, even if the Japanese merchant fleet still has the spare capacity to transport goods, I am afraid that there will be no goods to transport, right? Besides, does it have this kind of spare capacity? It is still a big question.

The Factory Chimneys Will Have No Smoke to Emit

The British and the United States, and their territories, including the islands of Southeast Asia, completely stopped the material trade with the Japanese sphere of influence due to the Pacific War. Even if Japan plans to use Shanghai's production equipment, it will fall into a situation where there is no rice to cook. Machines that are not afraid of anything are only afraid of not having raw materials. If they only rely on the raw materials in the occupied areas to maintain them, may I ask what raw materials can the occupied areas supply for the existing industrial equipment in Shanghai? Rice, wheat, cotton, soybeans, raw silk, and very little coal and iron sand can indeed be obtained from the occupied areas of China. However, these are not the targets that Japan wants to use Shanghai's industrial equipment for. Moreover, once the Pacific War starts, the Chinese troops in various places will inevitably rise up to counterattack, and the supply of materials from the occupied areas to Shanghai will be greatly reduced. Therefore, even if the factory chimneys rising on the roofs of Shanghai are not destroyed by Japan and are prepared to be used, they will not emit black smoke like they do now; isn't it imaginable.

The Japanese's Calculations Like This

Thinking for Japan, when the Pacific War breaks out and enters an inevitable raw material famine, the nature of Shanghai's existing collection and distribution center should be cherished and cared for. At that time, continuing to let Shanghai's international neutral status continue, making Shanghai a transit station for Japan to obtain material supplies from the democratic front countries, is definitely in Japan's absolute interest. Perhaps there are more Japanese people who have this fantasy than other kinds of people, right? But unfortunately, this is just the Japanese's wishful thinking. May I ask what good is it for the democratic front to retain Shanghai as this gateway? In other words: why does the democratic front still want to retain Shanghai as this port? Why should they continue to supply materials to Shanghai to help the enemy?

According to the Japanese fantasists, like the fantasies published by the reporter of Shanghai Daily News when the United States and Britain announced the freezing of Sino-Japanese funds: they believed that although the European War today has completely cut off the economic relations between the Axis countries and the democratic countries, the materials that both sides must exchange can still be traded in the market of Switzerland, a neutral country. Retaining Switzerland's neutrality is beneficial to both the Axis and democratic countries. And they believe that the situation is the same for retaining Shanghai's neutrality. Therefore, in the Far East War, Shanghai may become like Switzerland.

This kind of fantasy of the Japanese will greatly excite those people who are worried about Shanghai's future and at the same time are obsessed with Shanghai. However, fantasy is still fantasy, and Shanghai and Switzerland have their absolutely different destinies. It is impossible for Shanghai to maintain its neutral position in the complex Balkan Peninsula on an equal footing with Switzerland just because Shanghai has complex international relations.

### Political Economy and Status: Shanghai is Not Comparable to Switzerland

Firstly, Shanghai does not have the qualification of independence. It is a part of Chinese territory, transformed into its current state as an international city through various diplomatic treaties, fundamentally different from the Free City of Danzig. It is even more absolutely different from Switzerland, which possesses the qualifications of an independent country. Because Switzerland has the status of an independent nation, its neutrality arises from its position as a third party. In the struggle between the Axis and the Democratic sides, as long as it does not lean towards either side, neither can violate its neutrality. At the same time, both should respect its neutrality and thus utilize it. Shanghai is different. The occupied part is under the control of Japanese forces. The so-called complex relationships in the concessions are, in reality, still nothing more than the intertwining of the Democratic line and the Axis front. Therefore, merely in the current Sino-Japanese War, it is already extremely difficult to make the concessions adhere to neutrality. When the concession's big bosses, Britain and America, become enemies with Japan, there will be absolutely no possibility of neutrality in Shanghai. Of course, dreamers are accustomed to daydreaming, even speculating that in a future war, Britain and America will hand over the Shanghai concessions to a third party for trusteeship, and predicting who this third party will be, asserting that this third party must be someone who is favored by Japan and allowed to live freely outside the concentration camp. However, by that time, the so-called third party, if not a product born from the testicles of Japan, there will be no third party. Therefore, in the arena of a Far Eastern war, there is absolutely no possibility of a true third party appearing in Shanghai.

Secondly, both Britain and Germany retain and fully utilize the neutral market of Switzerland, not only because Switzerland genuinely possesses the qualifications and sovereignty of a third party but also because there is indeed value in utilizing this neutral market. Because the surplus products of Germany's heavy industry can be welcomed by the Democratic front, and the industrial products and raw materials of the Democratic countries are also highly sought after by Germany's military industry. Both sides have value in utilizing this neutral market, and this neutral market can then develop and prosper accordingly and stand firm. But in the future Far Eastern war arena, what do Britain and America seek from Japan? And what can Japan export and supply to Britain and America? Artificial silk, silk fabrics, toys, and canned fish are Japan's top products, but none of them are welcomed by the military economies of Britain and America. What do Britain and America seek? The supplies from Britain and America and their territories to Japan: oil, steel, machinery, hardware raw materials, etc., Japan would indeed welcome them with open arms, but would Britain and America be willing to continue supplying them? In short, Britain and Germany retain and utilize the Swiss neutral market because there is a need for its retention and a value for its utilization. As for Shanghai, if it were to be turned into a neutral market, Japan certainly has a need to protect it and a value in utilizing it, but Britain and America have absolutely no such need and no value in utilizing it. At most, in order to reduce the property losses of their expatriates in Shanghai, refraining from resisting on the spot would be the greatest favor they could grant to the future of Shanghai.

Thirdly, in terms of geographical situation: Although Switzerland hangs high above the Alpine peaks of the Balkan Peninsula, surrounded by the Axis powers of Germany and Italy to the north and south, it borders France to the east. Thus, the inflow of surplus products from the Axis countries into Switzerland's neutral market is extremely easy. Even the surplus products of democratic countries such as Britain and America can reach the Swiss market via the free zone of the French market. But what is the position of Shanghai? It can be said to be hidden in the hinterland of the Japanese naval defense line. Does Japan have the courage to open its naval defense line to allow ships from so-called neutral countries to pass through and sail to Shanghai? Even if it happens occasionally, it is foreseeable that it cannot reverse the misfortune of Shanghai as a dead port.

In conclusion: Maintaining Shanghai is only beneficial to Japan. For the war economies of Britain, America, and even China, it can be said that there is no benefit to speak of. Therefore, when the international political situation changes drastically, even if Japan does not exert political pressure on Shanghai, Shanghai will become a dead port. That is to say: even if the political situation in Shanghai does not change at that time, there can be no hope for the continuation of overseas traffic. And when the international political situation maintains the status quo and does not deteriorate, the fate of Shanghai's future depends even more on the smoothness of transportation conditions. According to the current situation: Shanghai's overseas traffic is getting worse day by day, not only is the number of ships decreasing, but also the freight rates are soaring. This is both increasing the pressure on Shanghai's commodity price market and also increasing the internal disruption of the Shanghai market. And the trend of decreasing ships and soaring freight rates is still in full swing. Why don't Shanghai's industrial capital with foresight take precautions in advance?

### The Worse the Traffic Environment, the Greater the Danger of Hoarding

It Seems Heroes Think Alike

In recent years, although the people of Shanghai have experienced many false alarms, their courage has grown a lot. A school of optimism: including Japan and the United States will not go to war, and Shanghai after the war will not be idle..., at first it was just a self-comforting statement in helplessness, and now it seems to have become a belief for them. They know that the number of ships is decreasing day by day; they also know that the supply of goods is decreasing day by day. However, they have another calculation: less imports, less exports; there is no problem with money. So making money is the first priority. If you can't rely on money, it's best to have real goods. With goods, you can be unscrupulous. The more panicked others are, the more successful they will be. After all, they are skeptical about the war between Japan and the United States. It is better to hoard alive than to hoard dead, which can not only avoid shelving funds but also earn more money from more decisions. An children's access is, after all, limited in strength: Why not use the floating funds in the market to expand their own plans? So they formed a logic: it is better to speculate than to hoard goods, it is better to open a bank than to speculate, and expand. Opening a bank can not only absorb deposits but also engage in various scales of speculation; once the wind blows, it can hoard goods on a large scale to drive up prices. Moreover, the banking industry is different from others, it doesn't matter whether the traffic is cut off or not. Recently, new banks have sprung up, which can be said to be the same thing that heroes see.

Opening a Bank is also Full of Crises

But unfortunately, the emergence of these new banks will only increase the danger of their funds and push the Shanghai market to a greater danger. The reason is very simple. Just talk about the danger of their funds.

(1) The banking industry is fundamentally a credit business. In wartime when people's minds are floating, you will encounter bad luck at any time. The reason why Shanghai's financial industry was able to cope with the "August 13" war was entirely due to stable financial measures. In recent years, the reason why the financial industry has been able to continue to enjoy prosperity is entirely due to the fact that the war is not in Shanghai and the speculation business has achieved smooth development. And the continued maintenance of foreign traffic is the biggest reason why Shanghai can form the current situation. In the changeable future, the situation may be completely reversed.

(2) Bankers and ordinary depositors have the mentality that it is better to hoard money than to hoard goods. Therefore, in the situation where the traffic conditions change blatantly, depositors will inevitably withdraw deposits to hoard goods, and the financial industry will have to sell the hoards to cope with the withdrawals. Not to mention the chaotic situation in the market, the bank itself will be greatly unlucky first, which should be beyond doubt.

The Interests of Traffic and Hoarders

(3) The current development of the international situation only makes it possible for Shanghai's foreign traffic to deteriorate more and more, and there is no hope for Shanghai's foreign traffic to turn danger into safety. It can be imagined that after the German-Soviet war is frozen with the freezing of the weather, the naval battle between Germany and Britain will intensify. And the rapid advance of the US's in-kind assistance to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the demand for ships will inevitably also be strengthened. As a result, Shanghai's foreign traffic situation will also worsen.

The worse the foreign traffic situation in Shanghai, the more the value of Shanghai's utilization for Japan will decline. This cause and effect is exactly the same as the relationship between the legal tender and Japan. The greater the effectiveness of the foreign exchange control of the legal tender, the smaller the possibility for Japan to buy foreign exchange. The smaller the possibility for Japan to buy foreign exchange of the legal tender, the smaller the value of the legal tender for Japan. As a result, Japan's attempts to destroy the legal tender may reignite. Although the foreign exchange control of the legal tender has been strengthened now, Japan can still buy some of it. This state of better than nothing has stabilized his current depressed mood.

Japan hopes that the Shanghai market exists because it wants to use the port of Shanghai to obtain the British and American goods that it is not easy to obtain in its own country. The worse the foreign traffic conditions in Shanghai, the smaller the value of Shanghai for his utilization will naturally be. So in the period when he is extremely feeling the material panic, how can he let go of the large number of hoards in the concession area? Japan is still requisitioning the goods of his own people, so how can he relax the people of Shanghai?

The term "Japan confiscates the hoards in Shanghai warehouses" is definitely not a word to scare children. The reason why it is not being carried out now is that the political problem is a point, and the fact that Shanghai still has utilization value is also a point; the reason why Shanghai still has utilization value for Japan is that the foreign traffic entering Shanghai has not been completely cut off; although the number of ships is decreasing day by day, it is better than nothing after all. Afterwards, the tighter the international situation, the more urgent Japan's preparations for war will be, on the one hand, making Japan's material panic heavier, and on the other hand, making Japan's utilization value of the port of Shanghai smaller. In this helpless sacrifice, there is naturally only one way to kill the chicken to get the eggs. Killing the hen to get the eggs when the hen is not sick is indeed what a fool does. The situation is different when the hen is sick. Therefore, the worse the foreign traffic in Shanghai, the worse the prices will follow, and the interests of hoarders seem to be getting bigger and bigger; but their danger is also getting more and more severe.

### What kind of work can an educated housewife do?

— Editor

Many people have asked the same question: "What kind of work can a housewife do?" That is indeed a question. Under such a question, they spend their days playing cards and strolling around, numbing their minds.

In fact, an educated housewife has many things to do in her spare time from housework, especially in terms of culture because men may not have enough time to implement them in order to maintain the family's income.

If you have a little spare time, then you can engage in research, engage in writing, engage in collecting, engage in compiling. Many valuable books can also be produced from this. Because great work requires constant effort, even if there is only one hour of spare time every day, there can be great achievements in one or two years.

Secondly, why don't those who love music try composing? Why don't those who love interior decoration read more books? Why don't those who love painting create a new style? These things are all suitable for women's personalities. Wouldn't life be more meaningful if they could choose one and continue to work hard?

### Mrs. Tolstoy's Complaints

— Yi

Anyone who has a considerable love for literature knows Tolstoy, this great figure. He was born in 1828 and died in 1910. He wrote many books in his life, especially "War and Peace," which made him leap onto the literary scene and occupy a lofty position.

However, he could not enjoy his family life. His wife once made the following complaints: "He really has no genuine enthusiasm because enthusiasm is just his doctrine and does not come from his heart. In his biography, you can certainly see him helping workers fetch water, but at home, he never gives me any time to rest (this has been the case throughout the 32 years of marriage). He has never given his children a drop of water, nor has he ever sat by my bed for five minutes to give me some comfort."

Although we cannot know the actual situation, from the surface, Tolstoy's marital relationship must not have been very harmonious. And his wife's complaints have some prejudices. A husband who has devoted his life to literature and occasionally neglects the family is not a crime. A person who is engaged in writing must concentrate all his energy on his work and allow no negligence in order to have great achievements; if he focuses on family life, then he will never have great works produced. For the sake of the wife's own comfort, there is a modern saying: "Don't marry a writer." However, for the sake of society and the country, and putting oneself last, then how honorable it is to have a husband like Tolstoy! (By honor here, I mean the honor of the country, the honor of society, and the honor of culture. Only last is one's own honor.) Therefore, if a wife can understand her husband's greatness and enable him to make a considerable contribution to society, the spiritual comfort she gets will be ten times greater than the physical pleasure she does not get.

As an aside, Tolstoy suddenly left his family in 1910 and hid in a small house in Astapovo, where he soon died of heart disease.

[P "My Family Problems" Essay Contest Results Announced: Children in the Hands of Stepmothers
— Yu Zhong

This essay contest received a lot of submissions, which shows the readers' enthusiasm for the magazine. Starting with this issue, we will publish them on a regular basis.

Editor

Whenever home is mentioned, people always think of the adjectives "warm" and "happy". However, my home is as cold as ice and has nothing worth cherishing.

My dad married a stepmother, and because of his job, he only came home twice a month, so I became a chick in her hands, subject to her disposal and torment.

Every morning at five-thirty, I get up, light the coal stove, serve my younger siblings (born to my stepmother) to school, empty the chamber pots, tidy up the rooms, and then go to school myself. When I come back at noon, I have to cook and wash clothes. Fortunately, classes at school don't start until three in the afternoon every day, so I can barely cope. After evening classes, I come back to cook dinner, make shoes for my younger siblings, mend socks, and spend the whole day busy with these household chores. My mom gets up very late and sits outside playing cards every day, so all the chores fall on my shoulders.

After ten o'clock, it's time for me to prepare my homework, but my sister says she can't sleep with the lights on, so my mom habitually makes a fuss: "What are girls studying for? Knowing a few words is enough. Holding books all day long, you really want to be a female champion. I can't control other people, but I don't have the role of a mother." She turned to her sister and said, "Dead ghost! You have to sleep even if you can't sleep! You don't even open your eyes when you talk. They have a lot of money, so they keep the expensive lights on." Heavens! How can I study in such an environment? But my mom had said long ago: "If you spend money, you should get good grades. If you don't get in the top three, you won't be allowed to continue next semester!"

When my dad comes home, my mom starts complaining in front of everyone: "She can't do anything, reading and writing all day long. Only I, her old nanny, suffer. Alas! It's really hard to be a stepmother! No matter how good I am to her, she doesn't know." If I'm doing housework at this time, she'll add this sentence: "What are you doing for show? Go read your books!" She'll immediately snatch the work from my hands and push me aside. In addition, she prevents me from meeting my dad alone. In fact, even when I'm alone with my dad, I don't have much to say. My dad is old, and I don't want to hurt his feelings. After she found out about this, she treated me even more wickedly.

My home is like this. As I write this, my mom came back after losing money and started grumbling, pointing fingers and scolding...

I dare say that Ms. Yu Zhong's situation is very common in Chinese families. We don't object to men remarrying, but men who remarry must not forget their children's future for their own happiness. Therefore, fathers of children who have suffered in the hands of stepmothers should bear considerable responsibility because the children of stepmothers are definitely not brought along at the time of marriage. At least at the time of the initial marriage, fathers can do some work to avoid discrimination by stepmothers against children born to their former wives, and at the same time, they can make the children born to their former wives not have another concept of stepmothers, thinking that stepmothers will always abuse the children of their former wives.

Naturally, since the initiator of this tragedy is the stepmother, educated stepmothers should not have any discriminatory or abusive actions. In such a great era, children are no longer the private property of their parents; they belong to the country. So why destroy the peaceful atmosphere in the family for the sake of some relationship with the children you have given birth to?

In any case, this is a problem worth discussing. I hope readers will contribute more concrete opinions. A few words are just to elicit valuable opinions. Editor

### A Week's Home-Style Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar. In economically well-off families, everyone ate a lot of fish, meat, shrimp, crab, chicken, duck, etc., perhaps eating too much greasy food. Starting from Monday, it's better to eat some light things to regulate the taste. Meat dishes, such as pickled mustard tuber with shredded pork soup, sliced boiled pork belly, celery fried shredded beef, clear boiled crucian carp soup, dried scallop egg drop soup, etc.; vegetarian dishes, such as tomato spinach soup, raw Malabar spinach, scallion radish shreds, vinegar shredded cabbage, etc., can be eaten to wash away the greasiness and cleanse the stomach. There are also taroes that are still in season, which can be peeled, stir-fried until browned, slightly seasoned with scallions, and stir-fried until soft and crumbly. The taste is more wonderful than white butterflies.

Monday: Pickled mustard tuber with shredded pork soup, stewed yellow croaker with preserved snow cabbage, raw Malabar spinach, scallion radish shreds

Tuesday: Celery with shredded beef, dried scallop egg drop soup, vinegar shredded cabbage, fried breadsticks with soybean sprouts

Wednesday: Sliced boiled pork belly, clear boiled crucian carp soup, stir-fried garland chrysanthemum, scallion stir-fried taro

Spring and Autumn

### One Shift System

— Wei San

In recent days, foreign businesses in Shanghai have been studying the so-called one-shift system, and twelve American companies have already announced its implementation. The purpose is to save on coal consumption because the days are getting shorter, and winter is approaching. The amount of coal needed for electric lights and radiators in the afternoon is truly astonishing. In this era of coal being as precious as gold, this measure seems necessary on the surface.

According to the American companies' plan, the morning and afternoon shifts are combined into one, starting work at 8:00 AM and ending at 1:00 PM without a break. After 1:00 PM, employees are free to go home. We believe this new proposal deserves study from both practical and advantageous/disadvantageous perspectives. Of course, we are not criticizing the gains or losses of foreign companies reforming their office hours, but merely offering an objective opinion.

We believe that any system should not be easily abolished unless absolutely necessary, before there is a guarantee of good results from the new method. Because sometimes implementing a new system may not bring benefits but rather cause problems. If we then revert to the old system, why bother with the change in the first place? Currently, the entire Shanghai society practices a two-shift system, which has become a traditional habit. Once changed to a single shift, everyone will feel inconvenienced. Commercial operations involve frequent contact with various parties. If Company A implements a one-shift system, and Company B has a major transaction in the afternoon that requires contact with Company A, it will have to wait until the next day. The resulting loss is self-evident. Besides this city, delays of half a day in the exchange of telegrams and messages with other cities and internationally also matter. We should not only consider our own convenience but also consider others, which is what is called benefiting oneself and others. If we only seek to benefit ourselves, it is untenable in principle.

As for the amount of coal saved, it is currently impossible to judge without precise statistics. In short, we believe that increasing revenue is one thing, and reducing expenses is another. If business is booming and things are busy, the office should be brightly lit, and people should still be working even until dusk. Of course, we shouldn't be concerned about the cost of coal. If employees working one shift can save on one trip's transportation cost, they might go to the movies or dancing during the long period from 1:00 PM to 9:00 PM after returning home, spending many times more than the cost of one trip.

The Chinese are truly worthy of pride. Our spirit of starting early and working late, enduring hardship and being hard-working, has been passed down from our ancestors to the present. Although cities need electricity and consume coal, villages may not need coal at all, and ordinary stores in Shanghai have never had radiators. I think this winter, we should all wear more clothes and not use stoves. As for unnecessary electric lights, we can reduce their use as much as possible. Saving on coal consumption through perseverance and hard work, we do not need to imitate the one-shift system. We should intensify our work, increase production, and maintain the long shift system from morning to night.

### Elder Lengchan's Humorous Words on Taking a Second Wife

— Gao

Elder Lengchan will take a second wife sometime after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Wood Taoist once presented him with a couplet, containing the line "leaping over the eastern neighbor's wall to embrace her maiden." His friend, Layman Chuwan, considered the word "embrace" (摟) to be a lively and expressive choice. He then used the word "embrace" as the first word of six *Sixteen-Character Song* poems to congratulate him. These poems are jocular without being rude, and contain gentle admonitions, making them quite amusing.

Sixteen-Character Song, Six Songs, with Preface

A half-taoist, cultivating to half-immortality; Layman Chan's Nest, participating in the joy of meditation (Both "Half-Taoist Wood" and "Layman Chan's Nest" are sobriquets given to Wood Taoist by Lengchan). Occupying the sprouting of a withered willow, surely many auspicious dreams. Stroking the old tree of flowers, how can there be ugly branches? Daring to offer admonitions, I've included jests. The lyrics of a small poem are equivalent to the true transmission of sixteen characters. Under the bright moon of mid-autumn, I sing of a hundred years of blissful union.

Embrace! Has the old man's amorousness not diminished? Pay attention to your chamber; do not lightly indulge your *qi*.

Embrace! Warming and re-warming, the tenderness is more tender. Has your soul dissipated? Truly, you must rest.

Embrace! Carved cheeks and combed whiskers, an unusual refinement. Who can count how many you do not allow to remain?

Embrace! Tonight, try a throw into your bosom. Share the same bed in dreams; how could you allow the gap of a great divide?

Embrace! Your room has two fish, good for staring. They pursue each other, their red brilliance reflecting in the porcelain cup.

Embrace! Beware of a master peering from above. Do not release so freely; the old tree cannot bear the autumn.

"Note": The old man's room has two goldfish, hence the name "Double Fish Hermitage." Every move of the old man is known to Master Wood, hence the sixth song.

### Busy with Gift-Giving Before the Festival

— Fang Yang

"Ah Er, go to Shao Wansheng to bring back a Jiang ham, one that costs over forty dollars. Then go to Guanshengyuan to get two boxes of mooncakes. Go to Sincere or Wing On to get four bottles of Changyu wine, and buy a basket of fruit by the way." Pack a ready-made flower basket, and count a few foreign dollars! Landlord Li was spiritedly instructing his rickshaw puller.

"Remember everything? Here's one hundred and fifty dollars; you count it!" The landlord entrusted him with great trust.

In fact, Ah Er was honest. He had worked for the Li family for nearly fourteen years, and since I moved in, I had often heard the landlord praising his virtues. Therefore, Ah Er served his master diligently like an ox. Although he occasionally grumbled, he always thought that the master was the master, and we servants had no choice but to do as we were told.

Today, he was very happy, partly because his master trusted him and, most importantly, because there would be "commission money" to "earn"!

I watched him go out excitedly. He was very thrifty for his master and didn't take the tram. He often told me!

"Mr. Fang, think about it. A rickshaw puller's legs are meant for running. Now that I'm not pulling a rickshaw, my body is free. Should I still take the tram?"

After about two hours, Ah Er brought back four items, his hands marked with red welts from the ropes.

The master inspected the items and settled the accounts. The four invoices totaled one hundred and one dollars and forty cents.

"You didn't buy badly!" Mr. Li praised him.

"Now, immediately deliver these to No. ×× Malan Road, to the residence of the bank manager. Be careful when you go in!" Mr. Li instructed, smoking a cigar on the side.

Ah Er replied with several "Yes, yes, yes!" and carefully left without looking back.

After a while, Ah Er returned, very happy, saying that he had received twelve dollars in "tips," giving two dollars to the maid and keeping ten for himself!

For the past few days, all I've heard is the landlord busy sending gifts out and receiving gifts in. The expenses for this sum of money must be within five hundred dollars. However, I don't understand why so many social affairs require so much money. When will this custom disappear? However, in this society where "a thousand wrongs are acceptable, but not wronging a sycophant," what can be done? I cannot answer.

In the evening, the landlord's wife was grumbling again, "The lights are being used too much; everyone, save some!" Immediately after, she closed the door and went upstairs. The sound of mahjong tiles echoed, and it would probably be dawn again under a hundred electric lights!

### Beriberi

— Zang Huan Chun

Patient: "Doctor! I feel very uncomfortable in my feet and it's very inconvenient to walk."

Doctor: "This is the most popular so-called beriberi in Shanghai! It is caused by eating foreign Xian rice, which lacks vitamins."

Patient: "No! Doctor, we eat Changxi Du rice at home every day; and we often take vitamin ABCD."

Doctor: "Then you must not be doing enough exercise with your limbs!"

Patient: "Alas! Doctor, I exercise in the dance hall almost every day!"

Doctor: "Then..."

### A Bundle of Nonsense

— Lu Jinglang

Mr. Praises Jin

Jiaming: "Mom, Mr. Huang at school praised me today!"

Mom: "What did Mr. Huang say?"

Jiaming: "Mr. Huang said that if Jiaming could get rid of all his bad temper, he would be a good child!"

### A Record of Laughter

— Deng Shiyi

Female Passenger: Hey! Give me a one dollar and twenty cent ticket.

Ticket Seller: Oh. Why take the streetcar on such a hot day? It would be better to walk.

Male Passenger: How unreasonable! What does it matter to you if she takes the streetcar? Why do you have to nag?

Ticket Seller: (Smiling) Sir, please don't get angry. She is my wife!

Woman A: Today's youth is really getting worse and worse. Look, they are barely old enough, but they know everything.

Woman B: No, I say today's youth is much more well-behaved.

Woman A: How do you see that?

Woman B: Twenty years ago, when I walked on the road, those young men would stare at me. Now when I walk on the road, they don't even look at me. Isn't that much more well-behaved? (Chuckles)

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Thirteen: Wandering to Shanghai

"Oh! Elder Brother, what do you know?" Begonia put down his teacup, shaking his head continuously, saying: "You are a bachelor, of course you are not afraid of anything! If you are happy to go to Tianjin today, then go to Tianjin. If you want to go down to Jiangnan tomorrow, then go down to Jiangnan. But we can't do that! Besides, I am now a farmer, and I have nothing to eat except farming. How can I compare to you?"

Yu Kun saw that he was almost frantic, so he jumped down from the table with a thud, showing a more serious expression and said:

"Good brother, what's the rush! I am also someone who has eaten old rice for more than thirty years. No matter how clueless I am, I will never leave you with any more trouble." Saying that, he pointed his hand at the opposite street. "Look, how have the young couple of the Meng family been treating you these days? You can relax! To be honest, when I started this matter, although there were three hooligans from Beihe Town helping me, they didn't know why they were robbing someone, or who they were robbing; once we got to the temple, I gave each of them ten dollars and sent them away. After that, I learned from Zhang Yide, Lord Zhang San, personally untied Lin Sheng, and even apologized to him. Later, I lived in that temple for more than ten days, and I treated him with good meat and wine every day. I also often explained to him your hardships and how Shang Lao Er didn't follow the rules, and even he said that everything was Shang Lao Er's fault. If he still bears a grudge against you in the future, that kid is not human!" (229)
