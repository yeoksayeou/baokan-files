### US Congress to Pass Bill: Extensive Aid to Democratic Nations; Roosevelt's Proposal Includes Five Items; Public Believes This Action Is Equivalent to Repealing Neutrality Laws

Washington - It is believed here yesterday that the administration's unprecedented bill to aid China, Britain, Greece, and other democratic nations will be submitted to Congress today. The bill includes a provision allowing British warships to be repaired in American shipyards. In addition, another provision declares that such steps will not be affected by other laws and regulations. Authoritative sources believe this action is equivalent to repealing the Neutrality Act and the Johnson Act. According to this provision, the United States can lend munitions, exchange national defense information with foreign countries, and damaged warships of belligerent nations can also stay in American ports. It is widely believed that the bill can be passed in the short term. The bill is called the "Act to Enhance American Defense." It stipulates that "the US President, when he" deems it beneficial to the country's defense, may disregard other legal conflicts and authorize the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Army, and other ministers to carry out the following matters at any time: (1) order military factories to manufacture various munitions to supply any country that President Roosevelt deems relevant to American national defense; (2) transfer any national defense supplies to this government by means of sale, transfer, exchange, lease, loan, or gift; (3) inspect, examine, modify, repair, or replace national defense supplies for other governments; (4) exchange national defense intelligence with foreign governments; (5) permit the export of national defense supplies. The so-called national defense supplies are "any weapons, ammunition, aircraft, ships, machinery, equipment, tools, raw materials, or industrial supplies, and work-related items." The bill authorizes the President to exchange unique national defense plans and drafts with other governments. In addition, it stipulates that these governments shall not transfer the acquired materials to others without the President's permission. This contract should also fully respect the private trademark rights of the American people. President Roosevelt said at a press conference that he personally did not hope to acquire the powers stipulated in the bill, but "it is obvious that someone must acquire this power." He said that if the US policy is to help democratic countries continue to survive, it must increase the legal speed. The President declined to predict how much it would cost to implement these plans. He said that the new bill would not amend the Johnson Act. The Johnson Act stipulates that credit loans should be refused to countries that have not paid their war debts. It is said that the new bill's "disregard of other legal provisions" is to avoid conflicts with the Johnson Act and the Neutrality Act. The President said that if the new bill is delayed in Congress for a week, the delivery of important raw materials from the United States to democratic countries in July will also be delayed by at least a week. He said that before Congress concludes the discussion on foreign-made munitions in US government military factories or shipyards, he is not prepared to submit a real budget request to Congress. Senator Barkley, a Democrat from Kentucky, is the person who will submit this bill to the Senate. Representative McCormack, a Democrat from Maryland, represents the House of Representatives in submitting it. McCormack said, "This means that we should manufacture supplies for our friends as if they were for ourselves." He also said that the bill would allow the United States to purchase raw materials lacking in the United States from American republics, Canada, and other countries that are important to American national defense. At the same time, Roosevelt told reporters that the export registration system for American copper, zinc, brass, bronze, nickel, and charcoal would take effect on February 1. The President also said that the US Export Control Agency will soon decide whether to issue permits, as it has done before for many important raw materials. (United Press, 11th)

Vital National Weapons: US to Provide Equipment and Repairs

Washington - Administration leaders yesterday submitted President Roosevelt's proposal to aid democratic countries to the Senate and House of Representatives. The proposal advocates: (1) the President may, when he deems it beneficial to national defense, manufacture or procure in arsenals or factories or shipyards under US jurisdiction any defensive equipment required by any government, and the defense of that country is regarded by the President as being related to the security of US defense; (2) the President may sell or transfer, or lease, or lend any defensive equipment to any of the aforementioned governments; (3) the President may test or repair, or equip, or organize any defensive equipment for any of the aforementioned governments; (4) the President may notify any of the aforementioned governments of any national defense information regarding any defensive equipment specified in Section 2; (5) the President may release any defensive equipment for delivery to any of the aforementioned governments. Congressional leaders also issued a document explaining the provisions of Section 3 regarding testing or repairs, stating that defensive equipment, whether manufactured in the United States or not, can be repaired in the United States. For example, the British battlecruiser Renown can also be repaired at the US Brooklyn Navy Shipyard, and the President must consider this to be in the interests of US national defense. This section has a broad meaning. Any US sea, land, and air base can repair or equip its weapons for any country whose defense is related to the security of US defense. This case is called the Aid to Britain Act, and it approves the necessary amount of funding to implement its provisions, estimated to be 100 million yuan. Senator Barkley, the Senate administration leader, explained the national defense information section in this case, saying that this section authorizes the President to consider using all drawings, drafts, or other information for special equipment. This information is only applicable to the defensive equipment supplied to foreign countries under this case, and the government can order defensive equipment for foreign governments, limited to what is available to the US Army and Navy. The Aid to Britain Act transforms the President's policy of making the United States the arsenal of democratic countries into a legal form, and implements the President's promise to deliver an increasing number of ships, aircraft, tanks, and cannons to democratic countries. This case allows the United States to supply various weapons to countries whose defense is deemed by the President to be related to the security of US defense. The document issued by congressional leaders explained that the President may permit the export of national defense equipment, stating that the ban on the export of certain military supplies in 1940 has been terminated as a result. However, this section does not stipulate that US ships be used to transport these weapons to the battlefield. (Reuters, 11th)

US to Issue New Ban Again: Restricting Exports of Copper, Zinc, Nickel, etc.

Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday vigorously emphasized to reporters the importance of rapid action to lease weapons to democratic countries, saying that the broad powers given by the Aid to Britain Act are indeed needed, so that rapid action can be taken. He has now signed a proclamation stating that from February 1, purple copper, white copper, brass, zinc, nickel, and potassium carbonate must be licensed before they can be exported. When reporters asked whether this matter involved the loan of destroyers, the President replied that no one had made such a suggestion. The President also said that the allocation of funds could be divided into two parts, one for immediate use and the other for preparation for future orders. A congressional leader told people after the meeting that this case could be sent to the President for signing within a month or five weeks. Other leaders seemed to believe that this case could be passed quickly, but they also knew that there would be some opposition in Congress, especially the Senate. (Reuters, 11th)

Washington - The "Aid to Britain Bill" is receiving the majority of support, as expected. When this case was presented in the House of Representatives, more than a dozen members stood up to criticize it. When it was presented in the Senate, Senator McKellar spoke, calling Hitler a "devil in human form." Isolationist Senator Clark said that this case allows President Roosevelt to "declare war" and will become a totalitarian government in domestic affairs. Members had differing opinions on whether this case was sufficiently thorough to approve US ships carrying military supplies to Britain or the Allied countries. Another member of the House said, "This is a step to push us towards totalitarianism. It is war, not peace." Senator McKellar proposed that all laws that would interfere with our giving Britain the assistance deemed necessary by the President or Congress should be repealed." (Reuters, 11th)

Washington - Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman George declared that under the provisions of the Aid to Britain Bill, US Navy ships will not be able to escort merchant ships to Europe. The draft of the bill has been amended to make this point clearer. This case will be considered by the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Monday. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet on Wednesday. Isolationist senators met on Friday night to discuss ways to defeat this case, but the general opinion is that they will only be able to obtain a minority and opposing vote. It is heard that many senators who intend to vote in favor of this case will try to impose some restrictions on the powers granted to the President. (Reuters, 11th)

### US Rapidly Expanding Navy: Ready to Support National Policy at Any Time; New Commander-in-Chief Issues Remarks: Will Continue to Deploy Warships in the Future

Washington - Rear Admiral Kimmel, who will succeed as Commander-in-Chief of the US Fleet on February 1, said yesterday that he will do his best to improve the effectiveness of the fleet and support national policy at any time. When he met with reporters yesterday, he declined to publish a definitive plan to bring the fleet to full readiness. His only answer was, "We have deployed warships in the past, and we will do so in the future." He said that he was surprised by the new appointment, so he did not discuss any detailed naval procedures. However, he said, "The US Navy is currently expanding rapidly in order to reach full strength. We are now building new ships, assembling officers and soldiers, and arming them. The new Pacific and Atlantic fleets recently pointed out and created by the President are indicators of the expansion of the Navy. You can be confident that I will continue to advance the work of my predecessors in the future, so that I can support national policy at any time when the government orders." (United Press, 11th)

Manila - Rear Admiral Bemis arrived here yesterday on the Clipper plane. A brief ceremony was held at 9:00 this morning to take office as Commander of the US Sixteenth Naval District. The former Admiral Smaley left office due to returning to the United States for medical treatment. (Reuters, 11th)

US to Ask Britain to Help with Expenses: To Manufacture Military Supplies

Washington - Senior officials here said that the government authorities, in order to ensure the smooth passage of the "Aid to Britain Bill" through Congress, have agreed to announce that Britain may be asked to help pay for the various military supplies received. It has been proposed that Britain should store about 200 million US dollars of assets in the United States as additional collateral for these military supplies. This 300 million yuan is the value of British real estate in the United States and various British companies operating in the United States. These assets will be placed in US government agencies as collateral. (Reuters, 11th)

### US Representative and British Prime Minister Discuss Far East Situation: US Determined to Help China; Britain to Strengthen Resistance to Japanese Pressure

Washington - Diplomatic sources recently said that the lending procedures in the US Pacific Defense Enhancement Bill are of broad importance, and China is also mentioned in the bill as one of the democratic countries that the United States is determined to help. Observers here are particularly concerned about the remarks made by Hopkins, President Roosevelt's special envoy to London. Hopkins said that the United States is doing its best to produce military supplies for Britain, the United States, China, and Greece. Far Eastern diplomats speculate that Hopkins, British Prime Minister Churchill, and even Foreign Secretary Eden must have discussed the situation in the East. Some people say that this factor may constitute an important part of Hopkins' mission. It is feared that Britain may strengthen its resistance to Japanese pressure in the future. Britain's position in the Bermuda Customs incident can be seen as an indication of the strength of the steps taken by Britain. British customs officials in Bermuda recently detained all the property of Japanese passengers traveling to Germany, and the British authorities in London also recognized that the actions of the Bermuda customs officials were within their authority. Diplomatic sources here also believe that Hopkins must have discussed with Britain the US use of British bases in the Pacific. Among the bases, the most prominent one, Singapore, has been extensively surveyed by Britain, the United States, and Australia. It is particularly noteworthy that Australia and the United States have recently exchanged naval attachés, which is an unprecedented initiative. Diplomatic circles also said that the general public generally believes that the United States may advance in Pacific affairs in a calm and unhurried manner. These people believe that the governments of Britain, the United States, and Australia must be proceeding carefully, or even secretly, in order to avoid any situation that could cause disputes. The reason for this is (1) US isolationists are not yet prepared to take responsibility for Pacific issues outside of Hawaii; (2) to avoid excessively stimulating Japan. US policy is to be strongly prepared to resist any new Japanese aggression near Singapore, but at the same time, it also wants to avoid any aggressive actions. Most authoritative sources believe that if the United States and Britain reach an agreement on the use of Singapore, Japan may launch a military retaliation at all costs. Therefore, diplomatic experts unanimously believe that Hopkins' remarks do not seem to have developed into a concrete agreement, but mutual understanding may have been increased regarding the various purposes that have been expressed. These people believe that the United States may not agree to use the suggestion of using Singapore as part of the repayment of the loan program. This action will not result in an increase in the hostility of the minority of isolationists in Congress. Therefore, any agreement on Singapore will not be announced until the future when Britain and the United States believe it is necessary to take strong diplomatic action against Japan, or it is strategically necessary.

Osumi Clearly States: Japan Determined to Advance South

Tokyo - Military Senator Admiral Osumi of the Japanese Navy recently gave an interview to a reporter from the "Asahi Shimbun" and discussed the situation in the Pacific and asked the people to study the situation in the South Seas in order to prepare for the plan to advance south. His words roughly stated that the policy of advancing south is the result of a natural desire. Because the South Seas area has a hot climate and sufficient light, people are willing to go there. If there is a nation that "obeys the natural order and seeks to advance south, there is no need to explain the reason." However, it is regrettable that the natives of the South Seas islands cannot understand our country's intentions. We have no intention of exploiting the South Seas area. What we sincerely hope is to share prosperity with other nations in East Asia. However, the natives of the South Seas are under the control of foreign forces, and these people are using various methods to prevent the natives from understanding our country's intentions. The more we show goodwill to the natives, the more uneasy these people become. At this moment, these people are buying military aircraft and warships. In fact, if they have a conflict with our country, these aircraft and warships will be of no use. As for what we call the South Seas area, what is the scope? I don't need to explain it. This area includes many places. If I list their names, some aspects will definitely be horrified. For this reason, I only say that the South Seas area refers to a place with sufficient light and a hot climate. We are now burying our heads in studying the situation in the Pacific. I dare say that this situation will soon become severe. We Japanese should overcome various difficulties to promote national fortunes. At present, our country is feeling a shortage of charcoal and rice, but this is not the time to complain, nor can we quibble over words. Generally speaking, the people of the country do not have a clear understanding of South Seas affairs. Some people's concepts are extremely vague, or even regard the South Seas as the birthplace of "Mount Tai" and the "Queen of Beasts." This is very regrettable. In short, although there are many green snakes, tigers, leopards, and other beasts in a certain place in the South Seas, flowers often bloom in other places. Our country must understand the truth about this corner. (Havas, 11th)

### Development of Balkan situation

Just as rumors were spreading that German troops were entering Bulgaria, preparing to attack Thessaloniki, Greece, the Soviet Union suddenly signed three agreements with Germany: one was an economic agreement, stipulating that the amount of goods exchanged between the two sides in the next year and a half should be more than in the first year; the second was an agreement on the relocation of German expatriates in the three Baltic countries; and the third was a border agreement between the two sides from the Baltic Sea to the Hungarian border. A careful examination of the content of the agreements shows that they are either a continuation of old matters or simply completed diplomatic documents, and there is no new meaning or development; but the fact that they were concluded today, when Germany has decided to invade Bulgaria to aid Italy, is certainly not a coincidence, but rather a planned action on the diplomatic front before Hitler launches a military offensive in the Balkans.

According to a report from the capital of Romania yesterday, German troops have almost entered the border, but the accuracy of this report remains to be verified. Assuming that the internal affairs of the above-mentioned agreement signed between Germany and the Soviet Union do include a compromise in which Moscow tolerates German troops passing through Bulgaria, one cannot help but ask: since the Soviet Union persuaded Bulgaria not to join the Axis powers at the end of November last year, why is it now willing to tolerate German troops entering Bulgaria to threaten its own gateway to the Black Sea—the Dardanelles Strait? Isn't this a contradiction? There seem to be only two possible answers to this question. One is that Hitler has given the Soviet Union a considerable price, enough to make the realistic Moscow authorities change their original intention of not wanting the war to affect Bulgaria. The second is that Stalin has felt threatened by the entry of 300,000 German troops into Romania and has to weigh the importance of things and distinguish between what is urgent and what is not in order to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war himself. According to the first hypothesis, Bulgaria may be about to encounter the second fate of Poland, that is, the Soviet Union takes its eastern half adjacent to the Black Sea and Turkey to ensure the "security" of the straits, while Germany controls its western half as a passage for German troops to go straight to Greece. As for the second hypothesis, it is true that, as this newspaper discussed a few days ago, Germany has seen through Moscow's weakness of not wanting to fight with real strength, so it is willing to submit itself. In the future, under the condition that Germany gives considerable guarantees, it can only pretend to be deaf and dumb and continue its so-called "neutral and observant" policy to wait for new opportunities to arise.

Since we are troubled by the lack of information, for the time being, we will not discuss the truth behind the German-Soviet agreement; because the whole story will come to light once Germany launches its next military offensive. What is worth discussing at present is, if Germany, as the rumors say, passes through Bulgaria to capture Greece, what impact will the Eastern Mediterranean war situation have? Looking at the map, it is not difficult to see that the territory of eastern Greece is just a long and narrow coastal strip. If Hitler uses mechanized troops and a large number of air forces to attack from Bulgaria in a blitzkrieg manner, it is naturally a matter of great concern whether the Greek army can resist. But on the other hand, Germany also has many unfavorable factors: first, the possibility of German troops passing through Bulgaria is not a new problem, but an old problem of the past three months. This, of course, the British-Greek allied forces have already anticipated. Therefore, it is believed that there must have been considerable arrangements in the Thessaloniki area. Once something happens, not only is it expected that the British army will be able to land and assist in the battle very quickly, but also the British navy and air force may have already made considerable arrangements. Therefore, in this regard, the British-Greek allied forces are in a state of waiting for work, and they will not be helpless against the German troops who come from afar. Second, Turkey has repeatedly declared that if Bulgaria joins the war, it will not hesitate to assist Greece in the war. Although Turkey's attitude may still be subject to Moscow's intentions in the future, its powerful army is ultimately a possible formidable enemy of Germany, and cannot be ignored by Hitler. Third, the war on both sides of the Mediterranean is almost approaching a situation of utter defeat. The "sea control" of the Mediterranean is now completely in the hands of the British Navy. Even if German troops enter Greece, it will still be difficult to shake the "sea control" of the British. In the event that the war cannot be developed as quickly as desired and falls into a stalemate again, then as time drags on, the British-Greek allied forces may, with the intensified assistance of the United States, obtain air supremacy in the Mediterranean in addition to sea control. In this way, not only will Italy become a turtle in a jar, but Germany will have just added another battlefield and dispersed its entire strength.

In short, Hitler must make a "desperate bet" before the Mediterranean war situation becomes hopeless, that is, before Britain firmly grasps both sea and air control. This was expected by the world long ago. Judging from the situation in the past few days, his claws seem to be aimed at the Balkans, and the Moscow authorities seem to be about to have another "watching" or "biased neutrality" that is not easy to understand. However, it can be asserted that future developments will not stop here. As for the three new agreements signed between the Soviet Union and Germany, at this moment, they naturally maintain the appearance of harmony between the Soviet Union and Germany, and are undoubtedly a diplomatic achievement of Hitler. However, they have not placed any new constraints or obligations on the Soviet Union. Everything, everything, must develop with the war situation in the future and evolve until the already destined ending—that is, the ending of the victory of public justice.

### Fighting Continues on the Vietnamese-Thai Border, French Forces Capture Multiple Positions, Thai Planes Fly Over and Bomb Cities, Bangkok Implements Blackout

Hanoi: In the Poipet (transliteration) area on the western border of eastern Cambodia, French and Thai sentries continue to clash. Hanoi officials say that French forces made further progress on Tuesday and recovered outposts 50 kilometers south of the Thai border and 50 kilometers south of the northern border of eastern Cambodia before defending Sisophon (transliteration). These positions were occupied by Thai forces three days ago. At that time, French forces had retreated to the mountainous defense line on the northern border of eastern Cambodia. Because Poipet is flat and vulnerable to foreign invasion, French forces had retreated to a better defense line. Yesterday, there were also battles in Yang Talum (transliteration), 25 kilometers northeast of Poipet, and Krabei (transliteration), 10 kilometers east of Poipet, but the casualties are unknown. (11th United Press Dispatch)

Hanoi: Officials announced yesterday that French forces had recovered outposts in northern Cambodia on Thursday. Thai troops occupied these positions four days ago when French forces retreated into the mountain defense line. A certain authority told the United Press that Thailand's actions should not be considered a real war. However, if the situation worsens, French forces may attack Thailand. A French person who arrived here from the Thai border said that French anti-aircraft guns shot down a Thai plane a few days ago, which was made in Japan. It is said that the bodies in the plane were also Japanese pilots. It is reported that the French and Thai artillery in Vientiane and other towns on the Mekong River continue to exchange fire. The Vichy government said yesterday that Vietnam has begun to retaliate against Siam's repeated attacks since January 5. It continued that although the atmosphere is currently full of appropriate air, it is hoped that future negotiations will be sufficient to end the border war. (11th United Press Dispatch)

Bangkok: The Thai Supreme Command recently stated that in retaliation for the French planes' attempt to raid the Thai capital, Thai planes invaded Vietnam this morning and bombed multiple cities.

Bangkok and other central cities have implemented blackouts. (11th United Press Dispatch)

Vichy: Regarding the situation on the Thai-Vietnamese border, French official news yesterday stated that the recurrence of Thai troops invading the border can be witnessed between Laos and Cambodia. After describing the events that occurred in the past few days, the official report stated that the French side has also taken retaliatory measures. However, since the path to ending the war through negotiations is not yet closed, the official report continued, the recent events on the border were all caused by Thai border authorities not contacting the Bangkok government. (11th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

Bangkok: The Thai General Headquarters bulletin stated that last night French planes flew into Thai territory in an attempt to bomb three locations. One plane appeared in the northeastern region of the Thai-Vietnamese border, one plane flew over the eastern border, and another plane flew to the outskirts of Bangkok, but did not enter the city and was driven away by anti-aircraft fire. Thai planes are now preparing to bomb Saigon and other three places in retaliation for this battle. (11th Reuters Dispatch)

Hanoi: Officials announced today that Thai officials said yesterday that a French plane bombed the Thai capital and was driven away, but French airmen had no intention of bombing Bangkok.

The authorities have also announced martial law. The buzzing of bombers is constantly disturbing at night, and artillery intermittently bombard across the Mekong River during the day. As soon as the people hear the sound of artillery, they rush to take shelter. When bombarded on Wednesday night, two civilians were killed and 19 were injured. Civilian shelters and air-raid shelters have been built in towns and villages along the border. When enemy planes attack, drums are beaten to warn residents. (11th Reuters Dispatch)

### British Military Iron Ring Tightens, Tobruk Heavily Besieged, Naples Heavily Attacked by British Planes, One Italian Battleship Heavily Damaged by Bombing

Cairo: According to the latest news from the front lines, the British Empire forces are gradually tightening the iron ring surrounding Tobruk.

(11th Reuters Dispatch)

Cairo: The British Air Force Command in the Middle East issued a bulletin announcing that when British planes carried out a particularly fierce attack on Naples, Italy, one bomb fell squarely on the stern of a Littorio-class Italian battleship or very close to it.

After being hit by a bomb at or very close to the stern of the battleship, a bright red light was emitted. Another bomb hit a large motor ship and caught fire, and the area from the northern end of a certain shipyard to a certain wharf along the harbor also caught fire. Several bombs hit dock buildings and railway lines, and the train station was also hit by multiple bombs. The gas storage machine caught fire, and bombs exploded continuously in the shipyard area and among the ships. One explosion on the northern railway line was particularly fierce. On January 8, British planes successfully attacked the Benina airfield in Italian Libya, hitting both the hangars and the planes parked on the field. Several hangars and barracks were seen burning fiercely, and at least twelve planes caught fire. Benghazi was also heavily attacked on Wednesday night, with bombs falling on administrative offices, causing fires and explosions. One ship was hit by a bomb. On the same night, Tobruk was attacked, and multiple buildings were hit by bombs.

### Improving Soviet-German Friendship: Signing of Three New Agreements; Trade Volume Between the Two Countries to Increase; Igorka River to Baltic Sea Defined as New Border

Berlin: Three agreements to adjust German-Soviet relations were signed yesterday in Moscow. One is an economic agreement, one is an agreement to relocate German nationals from the three Baltic states, and one is an agreement to demarcate the German-Soviet border from the Baltic states to the Hungarian border. The new economic agreement stipulates the trade volume between the two countries up to August 1942, which is much larger than the first agreement. The German national relocation agreement is the result of recent talks between German and Soviet representatives in Riga and Kaunas. According to the agreement, voluntary relocation by nationals can be carried out within two and a half months after signing. The border agreement is as described above. (November 11, Huitong Telegram)

Berlin: German officials stated regarding this matter that while rumors are rife, saying that German-Soviet relations are gradually deteriorating, we have not stood idly by, but have made the most of our time to strengthen the friendship and unity between Germany and the Soviet Union. This is truly a great victory for Germany. (November 11, Huitong News Agency Telegram)

Economic Agreement Contents

Moscow: A communique released here today states that Germany and the Soviet Union have established a new economic agreement. Economic negotiations between the two countries began at the end of October last year and concluded on January 10 this year. The two countries have now concluded a more extensive economic agreement. The Soviet signatory was the Minister of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade, and the German signatory was Dr. Schnurre, a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The new agreement is based on the German-Soviet economic agreement of February 11, 1940, and will promote the implementation of the economic plans of the two governments in 1929. The new agreement also adjusts the total trade volume between Germany and the Soviet Union, with a validity period extended to August 1, 1942. The agreement also stipulates that the Soviet Union will transport industrial raw materials, oil, and food (grains) to Germany, while Germany will transport industrial machinery to the Soviet Union. The quantity of goods transported will exceed the standards stipulated in the first year of the agreement's implementation. During the negotiations, both sides, based on the friendly relations between the two countries, promoted the signing of the new agreement in a spirit of mutual understanding and trust. Economic issues arising from the incorporation of new areas into the Soviet Union were also resolved in accordance with the interests of both countries. (November 11, TASS Telegram)

Berlin: Political circles in Berlin said today that the new German-Soviet economic agreement is "the greatest economic agreement signed between the two countries," with a cargo value reaching 1 billion marks. Grains are the largest component, with an amount previously unheard of in international agreements. Mineral oil, fuel oil, gasoline, lubricating oil, and similar goods also account for a large part. The amount of Soviet cotton transported to Germany is also extremely large, and manganese ore is also an important commodity. All goods transported by Germany to the Soviet Union are industrial machinery. (November 11, Huitong Telegram)

Border Agreement Terms

Moscow, January 10: Soviet government representative Vyacheslav Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, and German government representative, Ambassador Schulenburg, signed a new border agreement here. The new border, from the Igorka River to the Baltic Sea, was determined after Lithuania was annexed by the Soviet Union. The terms of the agreement are as follows:

(1) The German-Soviet border at the above-mentioned location is from the Igorka River, where border pillar No. 1-1 was erected in 1940 when the two countries demarcated the border and distributed national interests, located in the northwest direction of the Baltic coast. The new border passes through the following locations: (a) from border pillar No. 1-1 along the former border between Lithuania and Latvia (the Lithuanian-Latvian border was determined based on the resolution of the bilateral conference on March 15, 1912) to the point where the former borders of Germany, Lithuania, and Latvia meet; (b) from the above-mentioned junction point, along the former border between Germany and Lithuania (the German-Lithuanian border was determined by the agreement between the two countries on January 28, 1928) directly to the former Memel area border; (c) from the southern end of the former Memel area, along the former border between Lithuania and Germany (this border was determined in accordance with Article 1 of the German-Lithuanian Agreement of March 22, 1939) to the Baltic Sea.

(2) The border terms of the German-Soviet Agreement of August 31, 1940, apply to all legal border relations on the border stipulated in Article 1 of this agreement.

(3) The contracting parties agree to consider the legal maritime area issues on the border during continued negotiations.

(4) This agreement must be ratified by both parties. The exchange of ratification documents shall be held in Berlin in the near future. The above agreement shall take effect upon signing. The agreement consists of two copies (in German and Russian). The Soviet representative was Molotov, and the German representative was Schulenburg. The date was January 10, 1941. (November 11, TASS Telegram)

Immigration Problem Solved

Moscow: An agreement has been signed and resolved regarding the common property rights and immigration issues of Germany and the Soviet Union in Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia. According to a communique released here, "In recent weeks, Soviet and German representatives held talks in Riga and Kaunas on issues such as the transfer of German citizens and German nationals from the three Soviet Republics of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia back to German territory, and the transfer of Lithuanian and Belarusian people from German territory (the former Memel and Suwalki areas) back to the Soviet Union. On January 10, 1941, these negotiations came to an end. The two sides signed an agreement in Riga and Kaunas on immigration. According to the agreement, anyone wishing to leave the country can do so within two and a half months after the signing of the agreement, in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the agreement. The immigration agreements for Latvia and Estonia were also signed by Bokalov, Chairman of the Soviet Government Delegation, and Pensla, Chairman of the German Government Delegation. The Lithuanian immigration agreement was signed by Postiev, Chairman of the Soviet Government Delegation, and Nartke, the German representative. At the same time, issues related to the property rights of both parties related to immigration were also signed in Moscow. The Soviet signatory was Vishinsky, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Commissariat, and the German representative was Dr. Schnurre. (November 11, TASS Telegram)

### London Figures: Not Concerned; Believe Germany's Move Is Intended to Reassure Domestic Public

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that Germany's ambitious trade agreement with the Soviet Union, hoping to obtain a large amount of grains and oil in exchange for its machinery and other manufactured goods, has not been criticized by responsible parties here because they have not yet received the original text of the agreement. It is heard that the terms of the new agreement do not seem to be much different from the old one. Both sides need it in principle, with the Soviet Union being more fortunate to have a surplus of grains and oil, allowing it to export lubricants. However, it is generally believed that the amount of raw materials Germany has obtained so far may not be very large. The exact amount of Soviet raw material deliveries will depend on Germany's ability to deliver the various goods needed by the Soviet Union. In addition, there is another important factor, which is the transportation problem. If railways and other transportation cannot handle this large increase in transportation, the exchange of goods between the two countries may inevitably be delayed. Some people believe that since this new agreement does not have any novel provisions, it is surprising that the German side takes it so seriously. The German side's intention in this move is to carry out domestic propaganda to comfort the people who have been disturbed by the United States' promise to provide unlimited military supplies to aid Britain. (November 11, Reuters Telegram)

### Berlin Self-Satisfied

Berlin: The "German General News" commented on the German-Soviet trade agreement signed yesterday, and was quite self-satisfied, believing that Germany's trade policy has achieved its goals and achieved excellent results. Germany's economic system has laid a solid foundation, enough to make the British blockade policy's extravagant hopes fall apart. (November 11, Huitong News Agency Telegram)

Moscow: Today's "Pravda" commented that since Germany and the Soviet Union signed the non-aggression treaty in August 1939, the relations between the two countries have always been progressing in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual understanding. (November 11, Reuters Telegram)

### Roosevelt's Envoy: Issues Statement; This Trip Bears a Major Mission; Stay in Britain Up to Four Weeks

London: Roosevelt's personal representative to Britain, Hopkins, spoke to British journalists yesterday, saying that he has a very important mission. He has met with Eden and Halifax, and had dinner with Churchill, and the conversation lasted for quite a long time, 90 minutes longer than he expected. He is here as the US President's personal representative to meet with the British Prime Minister and other central government officials to discuss events of great importance to both the United States and Britain. He will stay in Britain until the matter is completed, for a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of four weeks. When reporters asked where victory would belong, Hopkins replied that he had no doubts about the outcome of the war. US arms production will reach its peak by the end of this year and the beginning of next year. The United States is now making a concerted and complete effort to manufacture the defenses needed by the United States, Britain, China, and Greece. Apart from Britain, he does not intend to travel to other European countries, but wants to travel around Britain to inspect various necessary things. Hopkins answered various questions from journalists with dry humor. When asked about his thoughts on Wednesday night's attack, Hopkins said that what he could think of was more important than his own reaction to this blitz. As for the truth of his mission, Hopkins was unwilling to express anything, only saying that although President Roosevelt is busy with affairs, he is very healthy, and his spirit and determination remain unchanged, which can be comforting to the British. He also said that in his opinion, Halifax's appointment as ambassador to the United States will definitely be a great success. (November 11, Reuters Telegram)

### German Planes Raid Britain Under Moonlight, Concentrated Bombing of Portsmouth; British Planes Raid Key Ports in Occupied France

London: After German planes carried out widespread bombing of the British Isles the night before, they resumed their usual tactics last night, concentrating their attacks on a certain coastal city in the south for several hours. (According to Berlin news, the city of Portsmouth on the southern coast of Britain, an important British naval base, has been heavily bombed by German planes since last night and into this morning. When the German Air Force launched the blitz in September last year, the city was also an important British target that suffered heavy bombing from German planes.) Portsmouth was severely attacked last night, and the fires after the bombing blazed into the sky, causing heavy losses. Bombs also fell in other places, but no one was killed. London enjoyed a peaceful moonlit night last night. German planes also flew over Liverpool and Merseyside, but did not drop bombs. (November 11, United Press Telegram)

According to claims here, military moguls and financial figures have already drafted a plan to expand the Air Force.

### Sawada Issues Moderate Statement; Japan Striving to Improve Business with the Dutch East Indies

Batavia: Sawada, head of the Japanese economic delegation to the Dutch East Indies, said yesterday that the Three-Power Pact does not change Japan's attitude towards other countries. Sawada said that Nomura, known to be pro-American, was appointed as ambassador to the United States, proving Japan's willingness to have peace. He said that the responsible figures in the Japanese government are trying to avoid difficulties with the United States, Britain, and the East Indies. He claimed that Japan "has no intention of changing the map of the Far East." He said that although Japan has desires in the Far East, they cannot be realized by sending Japanese troops to the East Indies. He said that there is a general feeling that the Dutch East Indies are less welcoming to Tokyo than to other capitals. Sawada said that the elimination of misunderstandings is enough to help Japan develop in the East Indies. The trade negotiations in Batavia, since Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi returned to the country, were postponed and will be reopened after Japan's new demands are translated into English. Sawada said that these discussions will be purely economic. He said that Japan's goal is to improve business relations between Japan and the East Indies. Japan especially needs to buy minerals from Dutch territory. His main goal is to correct misunderstandings about Japan's true goals. (November 11, United Press Telegram)

### Britain Recruits Youth for Aviation Training; King Appointed Commander-in-Chief

### European War Jottings (29): British Officer's Diary from the Western Front

Last night, rumors spread that the bomber command would dispatch British aircraft to bomb Essen. The German army is penetrating deep into France, yet the bomber command is focusing on Essen. How can this possibly stem the German advance in France? The bomber command should concentrate all its efforts on destroying key crossing points over the Meuse River, disrupting the enemy's formations, and attacking the dense columns of troops advancing from east to west along the main roads. I know this is not the British Air Force's primary task, but the situation is urgent and a change of strategy is essential!

Today, what we hope for and pray for is unified command. There are simply too many decision-makers now, with conflicting opinions and endless disputes, making it impossible to reach a consensus. If a single dictator were to issue orders, it would be easier to achieve results.

Noon: Our troops have retreated again. Two divisions of German mechanized units are pursuing westward via Verdun and Boumont. The garrison at Reims has withdrawn, and we have been ordered to move further northwest to circle behind the British forces at Amiens.

8 PM: According to French reports, they are preparing a large-scale counter-offensive against the pocket along the Meuse River. British troops will move there tonight and then return to the Escaut River line tomorrow. We can only hope that our fighter planes can completely drive away the German bombers!

May 17th: The war situation is not favorable. The French Seventh Army and the British forces are hastily retreating, planning to defend a line from Antwerp and Brussels behind the Seine River to Charleroi.

Our troops have not launched a counter-offensive. The German army has breached the right flank of the British forces south of Brussels, creating a serious situation. The French Ninth Army is still trapped, but the First and Second Armies can launch a flanking attack against the German salient along the Meuse River.

May 17th, Noon: The war is worsening, and what is infuriating is that many units within the French army are not truly fighting. German armored divisions have rendered them unable to resist. This is exactly like the situation in Poland.

5 PM: The Air Force commandoes have departed to attack Laon, La Fère, the Oise River, and the area between Cadoux, Avennes, Verdun, Crecy, and Le Thuel. The entire area is practically a no-man's land. Only a few French troops are scattered along the Aisne River and north of it. The bridges at La Fère and Ribemont have been seized by the German army. The French have no preparations for a counter-offensive. The outcome is obvious.

May 18th: The news we initially hoped for is now coming in from all sides. The French army has launched a counter-offensive against the German army. General Giraud sent a battle report saying, "Fifty German light and heavy tanks have attacked our forces. We are gradually encircling and annihilating them." This is the usual formulaic language, a characteristic of the generals we rely on to stem the German offensive.

Although French morale has improved slightly this morning, the German army is using fifth columnists to spread various rumors from the rear, causing morale at the front to plummet again.

8:50 PM: We have been ordered to retreat to the forward headquarters established at Versailles-La Ferté tonight. The forward headquarters was bombed by enemy aircraft, but fortunately, General Georges and his staff had already left in time, escaping unharmed. Or perhaps this is just a rumor.

Enjoyed a delicious breakfast in Barracks Number One. During the last European War, this fortress was the headquarters of British Commander General French. The elegant gardens and wide stone paths exude an atmosphere of peace, making it hard to believe that the battlefield is just twenty miles away. It is truly a remarkable contrast.

I have read General Gamelin's moving order urging French soldiers and civilians to persevere and not retreat. Is this a repeat of history, or merely an imitation of history? I feel it is just an imitation. They want us to believe that the victory at the Marne will be repeated today, but do they themselves believe it?

If the French army could completely annihilate all ten German armored divisions, the enemy's attack could be stopped. The French 70-ton heavy tanks, which were touted for a while, are actually few in number. At most, only twenty have been produced. Before the German offensive began, the French army hoped to have the opportunity to use these heavy tanks to sweep away the German armored divisions. French officers boasted that they had at least a thousand heavy tanks, but now it is clear that they have far fewer than the enemy. They have fought bravely, charging into battle and advancing fearlessly, but when they encountered the heavily armored German tank units, they were helpless and ultimately collapsed completely. The German victory this time is entirely due to the combination of dive bombers and armored divisions. May 18th: We must go through the London Air Ministry to communicate with the British Expeditionary Force.

May 18th, 10 PM: German mechanized divisions are still rampaging, having reached Belloy-en-Santerre and Cambrai. This afternoon, an Air Force detachment bombed sixty enemy tanks with considerable success. The British and French forces are preparing to scout for concentrations of enemy mechanized units tomorrow and then destroy them in one fell swoop. The French light motorized divisions are no match for the German heavy tank units. Since there are no 70-ton heavy tanks, the only option is to use air attacks – at least that's what the French high command is saying.

Rumor has it that there are about six German armored divisions in the area of the bulge at Sedan. May 19th, 4 AM: The Air Force commander has sent me to prepare for the first sortie. Large German formations are beginning to advance east of Laon. One infantry division is stationed in Grand-Désert. German tank units have charged west of Cambrai and Belloy-en-Santerre, moving freely. The French headquarters has left Arras and is said to be moving to Beauvais. These German tank units do not have large numbers of troops following them. Within sixty miles, there are only motorized units and tank units without infantry. According to a gendarme in Arras, he saw a column of tanks coming down the road, so he stopped traffic on the cross street and waved them through. Only when they opened fire did he realize they were German tanks. This shows how fast things were moving and how unexpected the attack was. He was fortunate enough to escape with his life and tell this story. It is truly remarkable.

3 PM: News has arrived that German mechanized units have reached Amiens. This is like a nightmare. The British forces have been cut off. Our lines of communication have been severed. The only option for the British forces at this point is to retreat as quickly as possible. Following orders, I burned all public and private documents. I have only read about such things in tragedies, and I never dreamed that we would experience it ourselves.

Today, the Allied authorities held a meeting. General Dill hurriedly flew in from London. He is said to have declared that the British forces will fight to the last man and the last bullet. The French forces should be satisfied to hear this.

### Japan's Policies Waver and are Thrown into Disarray as the U.S. Strengthens Far East Actions; Japan's Import and Export Trade is Almost at a Standstill; Nationals of Axis Countries have also Begun to Withdraw; Foreign Nationals Arriving in Shanghai from Japan Analyze the Japanese Political Situation

According to a certain foreign national who recently arrived in Shanghai from Japan, over the past few months, British and American nationals residing in Japan have been gradually withdrawing, either at the advice of their governments or of their own volition, fearing that if the United States and Japan were to join the European war, residing in a foreign country would not be safe. Due to this influence, and because the atmosphere of American involvement in the war has recently intensified, nationals of Axis countries residing in Japan have also begun to withdraw, although the latter is mostly due to economic reasons.

All Trade Will Be Lost

Since the outbreak of the current European war, Japan's trade relations with Europe and Africa have already been severed. The only markets for Japanese merchants and foreign merchants residing in Japan are currently in the Western Hemisphere, the United States, and various South American countries. However, restrictions on U.S.-Japan trade are becoming increasingly stringent. If these two markets are blocked, Japan's import and export trade will come to a complete standstill. The United States' participation in the war is almost only a matter of time. In the future, the trade routes between the Axis countries and Japan will be under American fire, and even transportation between China and Japan will be in serious danger. At this time, Japan can only sit and wait for its doom. Therefore, the continuous withdrawal of foreign nationals residing in Japan is a precautionary measure.

Hesitant, Uncertain, and Unable to Decide

The foreign national also stated that the Japanese are reaping the consequences of their own actions. Their biggest mistake was signing the alliance treaty with Germany and Italy. Initially, it was intended as a mere threat against the United States, but it unexpectedly backfired. Hardly anyone in Japan wants to go to war with the United States, and even the Japanese military leadership does not want to fight the United States, knowing that their strength is insufficient. However, they are deeply mired in a diplomatic quagmire, just as the Japanese army is deeply mired in a military quagmire. They cannot advance, and they cannot retreat.

The Japanese Public is Gradually Awakening

The Japanese people used to blindly believe in everything, but now they have begun to doubt. They are just under pressure and unable to do anything. However, they no longer trust certain propaganda. The foreign national continued that the Japanese people's dissatisfaction with the current situation has been overflowing for the past two years. In order to "kill the chicken to scare the monkey," the Japanese government often falsely accuses foreign nationals residing in Japan of malicious propaganda, obstructing the "New Order in East Asia," and espionage. Recently, a group of American school teachers arrived in Japan to investigate the real situation in the Far East. They stayed in Japan for only a few months before leaving as enthusiastically as they had arrived.

### British Consulate Processes Registration of British Nationals

The British Consulate-General in Shanghai is now handling the registration of British nationals starting on the 4th of this month in order to conduct the annual population statistics of nationals as a matter of routine. All British nationals residing in Shanghai must bring their passports to the Passport Office of the consulate to register every day from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Consul General George has issued a notice to inform all nationals.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Handwritten Instructions on Key Points for Suppressing Grain Hoarding; Hoarded Food Must Be Cleared Out by Lunar New Year's Eve; Information Discovered about Large Quantities of Siamese and Vietnamese Rice Waiting to be Transported

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is concerned about the people's suffering. Recently, in view of the soaring food prices and commodity prices, which have made the people's situation even more difficult, and the hoarding and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants, which is one of the important reasons, he issued handwritten instructions at the beginning of the month, ordering all parts of the country to earnestly suppress it. These instructions contain six key measures, which have now been forwarded to Shanghai. The reporter of Ping Ming News Agency has obtained the full text as follows:

Deadline for Sales Before the Lunar New Year

(1) All stores, firms, and private individuals who have hoarded various grains, food, and essential daily necessities must sell them as much as possible by January 26th of the 30th year of the Republic (i.e., Lunar New Year's Eve) to supply the market and meet the needs of the people. If it is expected that they cannot be completely sold out before this deadline and there are still remaining grains and goods in stock, they should report the remaining quantity to the food management agency or the local competent authority and continue to supply and sell them. (2) If any hoarded grains and goods are not voluntarily sold within this deadline or are not truthfully reported and registered as ordered, they will be considered as hoarding for speculation and will be punished according to military law. In addition to confiscating the grains and goods, they will be severely punished without leniency.

Legitimate Merchants are Not Allowed to Close Down

(3) All those who sell and register in accordance with the order will be guaranteed legal profits by the government. (4) Legitimate merchants who originally operated should continue to operate as usual and are not allowed to close down, guaranteeing their legal profits in business. (5) No one is allowed to privately purchase and hoard grains and goods exceeding the quantity for daily use, in order to protect legitimate business. Those who currently have hoarded goods should handle them in accordance with the provisions of item (1) above until they are completely sold out. (6) Omitted.

Large Quantities of Foreign Rice are Awaiting Shipment to Shanghai

Foreign rice has been arriving in Shanghai in a steady stream in considerable quantities. As of the 10th of the month, a total of 13 ships had transported more than 124,100 bags, of which more than 19,100 bags were directly shipped from Haiphong, more than 6,000 bags were directly shipped from Saigon, and the rest were shipped from Hong Kong. Yesterday, another 32,515 bags arrived at the port, including 20,253 bags shipped by Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng from Hong Kong and 12,258 bags shipped by Butterfield & Swire's Jia Ying from Siam. According to the shipping industry, it has recently been learned that large quantities of foreign rice from Vietnam, Siam, and Rangoon are awaiting shipment to Shanghai. As for the opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, shipping companies are eagerly seeking to send ships to sail the Shanghai-Burma line, because at the beginning of the opening, the Yunnan-Burma Road was entirely for government military transport, and it was feared that passengers and cargo could not be transported inland, so they are temporarily watching. Now that the situation has improved, the Hong Yun Shipping Bureau in this city has dispatched the Tiebo Ke wheel to Rangoon directly on the 7th of this month, carrying a lot of goods. Also, Butterfield & Swire's Zesheng wheel (this wheel was leased from China-India Steamship Company) departed from Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 10th of this month and went directly to Rangoon, also carrying a lot of goods. It is heard that when the two ships return to Shanghai, they will also load foreign rice to Shanghai. In the future, there will be no shortage of food in this city.

### Chinese National Spirit Grows Stronger with Each Battle; The Day of Victory is Not Far Away: Dr. Fei Wu's Words to Soldiers of the Isolated Battalion Yesterday

Dr. Fei Wu, a friend of China (who went to the United States from the Ling District to raise relief funds for China and achieved great success, recently returned to Shanghai from the United States and plans to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong today to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's wife, Madame Soong Mei-ling, and Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Madame Kung Hsiang-hsi, Soong Ai-ling, to report on everything and then fly to Chongqing to work), visited the isolated battalion of Commander Xie Jinyuan of the 4th Regiment on Jiaozhou Road yesterday afternoon at the invitation of Commander Xie Jinyuan and reported on the general situation of free China. The reporter of Da Zhong News Agency received a notification from Commander Xie in advance and was able to witness the grand occasion and listen to Fei's great speech. The details are recorded as follows:

Visit to the Barracks and Brief Report

Yesterday afternoon, Dr. Fei Wu, accompanied by Qingjian Huilai, Si Jun, and Mr. Song and Mr. Xiao, went to the isolated battalion. Commander Xie Jinyuan received them and accompanied them on a tour of the area. Fei praised the excellent quality of the small-scale industrial production of the isolated battalion and the brave, resolute, and lively spirit of the soldiers. He also praised the cleanliness and order of the barracks and the beauty and suitability of the various decorations. Lai Sijun also bought three pairs of socks at the cooperative as a souvenir. Then, under the leadership of Commander Xie, Fei and others went to the lecture hall to introduce themselves to the entire isolated battalion. All four hundred soldiers applauded and warmly welcomed them. First, Commander Xie made an introductory speech, briefly stating that the United States is a pillar in the anti-aggression front and that Fei is China's most sincere friend. We are very fortunate to have this good opportunity to listen to Fei's high-level discourse. Then, Fei stood up and gave a fifteen-minute report to the isolated battalion, with Mr. Song acting as the translator.

Praising China's Increasing Strength in Each Battle

Fei first stated, "I am very honored to be able to speak with you in the same room. When I was in the United States, I met a Ms. Yang who told me about the heroic battles of the isolated battalion, which often made me yearn for them." He continued, "During the three years of the sacred war, I personally experienced the situation in Hankou, Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, and other places and was responsible for relief work for wounded soldiers with Mr. Huang Renlin. Therefore, I was able to see the brave fighting spirit of the Chinese soldiers and civilians. The national spirit that grows stronger with each battle can be summed up in one word: 'unbeatable'. I am deeply gratified to be able to fulfill my personal responsibility under the heroic collective of this 'unbeatable' spirit." Fei concluded, "You are all valuable cells of China's resistance and reconstruction. The day of victory is not far away. I believe that you will soon be able to return to your original positions." After Fei finished his report, Mr. Song introduced Fei's history to the isolated battalion, saying that Fei's efforts for China were enough to shame those who only paid lip service. Finally, Fei and Commander Xie took a photo together and the meeting ended.

Great Success in Raising Funds in the United States

Dr. Fei Wu is an American, born in Suzhou. He has lived in China for a long time and has a thorough understanding of the situation in China in all aspects. He can observe various problems with keen insight, and his judgment is even better than that of the Chinese people. He used to work in the YMCA. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he has followed the Chinese army in its westward retreat, from Nanjing and Hankou to Chongqing, Guiyang, Kunming, and other major rear areas. There is no place in free China that he has not set foot in. He has done his best to dedicate himself to the work of relieving wounded soldiers and refugees. Usually, he planned and worked with Madame Chiang and Huang Renlin, enduring all kinds of hardships and sparing no effort. He went to the United States last June to raise relief funds for China and achieved great success. He has just arrived in Shanghai before and must leave Shanghai for Hong Kong today to meet with the two Madames, Chiang and Kung, to report on everything before flying to Chongqing to work.

### Maintaining the Livelihood of Workers and Eliminating Labor-Management Disputes; The Municipal Federation Urges Increasing Benefits as Much as Possible; All Labor Disputes in Various Industries will be Resolved Satisfactorily

Shanghai's commodity prices are soaring, threatening the livelihood of four million citizens. The working class, unable to make ends meet, is in an even more miserable situation. The First Special District Citizens' Federation of this city, given that the lunar New Year's Eve is approaching and commodity prices are even more abnormal, and that businesses decide on the advancement and retreat of employees at the end of the year, issued a letter to various industries, urging them to earnestly maintain the livelihood of employees and help them overcome difficulties. It stated that Shanghai's environment is harsh, and we are all in the same boat. Many workers in various industries work diligently all day long but are not able to keep warm and eat their fill. Caring for their elders and raising their children is even more difficult. The difficulty of making a living is unprecedented. It is hoped that they will follow the clear instructions of the authorities on wartime labor-management coordination, earnestly maintain existing employees, and, within the possible scope of business conditions, reduce dividends and official fees as much as possible, increase employee benefits, or provide group rice purchases or rice subsidies. Employees will naturally be inspired, work hard, and share the difficulties.

Four Car Companies Agree to Respond Tomorrow

The 900 drivers of the four car companies in this city, Yunfei, Xiang Sheng, Tailai, and Yinse, due to the ever-increasing cost of living, have made demands to these companies, including: (1) Increase annual bonuses; (2) Increase wages by 50% or increase 30 cents per day; (3) Increase subsidies by 100%. However, because the company authorities did not accept it, it was deadlocked. Later, with the mediation of Gu Bingyuan of the Industry Section of the Public Works Department, the employer agreed to respond at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. The employees then sent representatives to the Public Works Department to negotiate with the employer's representatives again. However, the response was too far from the demands, and the employer even proposed to sign an agreement that the salary could not be changed within two years, which was even more dissatisfied with the employees, resulting in the breakdown of negotiations without any results.

The Final Key Depends on Tomorrow

Although labor-management negotiations have broken down, the employer agreed to make a final response at 10:00 AM tomorrow morning. The employees will send representatives to the Public Works Department to hear the results. The employees' attitude is now very firm and they have decided to convene a general meeting at 9:00 AM this morning and establish a "Strike Committee". If the employer's response tomorrow can satisfy the workers, then such an unfortunate event can be avoided. People from all walks of life, given that these four companies are related to the city's transportation, hope that they will make concessions to each other and resolve the matter as soon as possible.

Salary Increase for Postal Workers Still Awaiting Reply

All postal workers and porters of the Shanghai Postal Administration and its subordinate branches, due to the pressure of making a living, made a request to the Director of the Postal Administration, Mr. Zha Peilin, in November last year through the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, to issue year-end bonuses, including various living allowances, and to issue living index subsidies, which are calculated as 21 yuan based on the multiple of the Public Works Department's living index. Zha has repeatedly asked the Kunming General Administration, but has not received a formal response. Now, the association, in view of the members' increasingly difficult lives, cannot wait any longer and has once again appealed to Zha, asking the Director of the General Administration, Mr. Guo, to reply satisfactorily before the 13th of the month. A reporter from New Voice News Agency inquired from all sides of the bureau yesterday, but there was no information about the arrival of the telegram. However, there were rumors, one saying that the telegram had been received yesterday afternoon, and another saying that it had not yet been received. Although sources revealed that the Kunming General Administration's reply was not received yesterday, it is expected that the telegram may already be on its way.

The Commercial Press Union Makes a Final Appeal

All employees of the Commercial Press Bookstore on 211 Henan Road and the Jing'an Temple and Avenue Joffre branches, after not being granted a salary increase by the employer, were very angry. However, in order to take care of the past cooperative spirit between labor and management and continue to serve the cultural world, they still strictly maintained order and did not take any excessive actions. In order to discuss proper solutions, the Union held a temporary emergency joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday morning. After a long period of consultation, it was decided to telegraph General Manager Wang Yunwu in Hong Kong again, asking him to withdraw his order and accept the conditions proposed by the union in order to maintain their livelihood and work with peace of mind. The union also convened a group leader meeting at 5:00 PM last night. The opinions of all groups were consistent, and the union was fully authorized to handle the matter. In addition, the 800 workers of the Jing'an Temple Road edition printing plant, the Jiujiang Road typewriter copper mold factory, the Fujian Road manufacturing factory, and the Guangdong Road distribution warehouse affiliated to the Commercial Press also proposed five demands to the employer through the mutual aid association due to the difficulty of making a living.

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury Also Experiences a Slowdown

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, "This newspaper (the 11th) is not complete." (Note: The newspaper was half as long as usual yesterday.) "This is due to a labor dispute. Some of the newspaper's printing workers have gone on strike. This matter is expected to be resolved peacefully. When it is published next week, it should be normal and complete."

Other Labor Disputes are Expected to be Resolved

Dock Workers Have Resumed Work Yesterday

After the dock workers of the Suzhou River bank warehouses and stacks went on strike to demand a salary increase, it was heard that the contractors Xia Jinshan, Li Zhonggang, Qiao Bingwen, etc. have sent a plenipotentiary representative to consult with the workers' general representative Yang Jiasheng and others on a reconciliation method. After several decisions and negotiations, the labor and management have also agreed on the various conditions. The docks resumed work in full yesterday morning, and the reconciliation record will be signed this morning.

Guangji Hospital Holds Sincere Negotiations

All 150 employees of the Guangji Hospital on Route Pére Robert in the French Concession were expelled from the hospital on December 30th last year after they made a request to the hospital to improve their benefits without success, resulting in a strike. More than 400 patients in the hospital were left unattended for a while, forming a serious situation. This labor dispute has been deadlocked for ten days. According to a visit from the reporter of Ping Ming News Agency yesterday, the hospital and the employee side, after mediation by the French Police Political Department, the Catholic authorities, and Bishop Hui Jiliang, etc., have seen a glimmer of hope. The hospital has also accepted the advice and has decided to summon labor representatives and others for sincere negotiations in the coming days. The dispute can be resolved immediately. As for the dozens of new workers recruited by the hospital during the strike period, it is heard that they will resign successively after the labor dispute is resolved. The hospital does not intend to continue to recruit new workers.

All Knitting Disputes Resolved

The 300 engineers and technicians of 129 electrical knitting sock factories in the city proposed to the employers to improve their benefits and increase living allowances. After more than half a month of earnest negotiations between labor and management, they have been negotiated in order and most of them have resumed work since the other day. However, there were still eight or nine knitting factories that did not promise at the time due to their thin capital. Later, after separate scheduling by the authorities, they were completely negotiated the night before and slightly revised according to the proposed conditions. Yesterday noon, the representatives of labor and management separately signed the papers and each held one. The engineers and technicians of each factory also received a notice from the union yesterday morning to return to the factory and resume work in full.

### American Public Opinion Unanimously Sympathetic to China, Already Acknowledges China as an Ally, Changes Mentality of Passive Assistance

Mr. Ross, international editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, departed from San Francisco last October for his second tour of the Far East, staying briefly in Japan before traveling through the Philippines, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. He recently arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong. It is said that his purpose is to "observe the actual situation in the Far East" in order to write articles for the San Francisco Chronicle. A reporter interviewed Mr. Ross at his residence yesterday and learned that he will soon travel to Japan again before returning to the United States. The reporter inquired about American public opinion's reaction to the Far East. According to him, Japan's participation in the Axis Pact was a turning point for American public opinion. In the past, the United States was not as concerned about the situation in the Far East, but now the American people have begun to recognize the extreme seriousness of the Japan problem. Japan's open declaration of joining the Axis Pact is, in effect, a hostile act against the United States. Therefore, President Roosevelt's recent remarks criticizing Japanese policy represent the views of the general American public. Mr. Ross further stated that the American people now unanimously acknowledge China as one of their allies and have transformed their mentality from merely providing charitable relief to China. As for Britain, the United States is determined to avoid Britain's defeat by Germany at any cost. If necessary, the United States may declare war on Germany.

### British Tram Company Raises Fares, Municipal Council Has Approved, Lowest Fare of Six Cents to Be Implemented on Lunar New Year's Eve

The British Shanghai Tram Company, after implementing a fare increase on June 17th of last year, recently used the continued decline in black market exchange rates as an excuse to petition the Municipal Council for approval to raise fares again. According to reporters from Pingming News Agency, the fare increase will be approximately 35%. The lowest fare, originally four cents, will increase to six cents after the price hike. As for monthly tickets, there will be no price increase this month. The current price of monthly tickets is 15 yuan for first class and 18 yuan for third class per month. Trams are a public utility, and the current prices of various commodities are already an unbearable burden for citizens. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities can restrain the company, and it is hoped that the company can reorganize its business and increase revenue, instead of relying solely on increasing fares as the only way to increase revenue, which would make them a laughingstock to both Chinese and foreigners.

Original Submission from the Tram Company

According to the Municipal Council's Information Office, the Public Concession Tram Company recently claimed that the continued decline in exchange rates and the devaluation of the national currency have greatly affected various expenses. Therefore, it has petitioned the Municipal Council, based on the franchise charter, to allow an increase in fares of approximately 35% in order to supplement its income. According to the company's submission, in January 1930, the exchange rate was one shilling, five pence, and seven-sixteenths, but currently it has fallen to about three pence and seventy-five. In the same year, each unit of electricity cost only 3.05 cents, but in November of last year, it had risen to 16.27 cents. Coupled with the devaluation of the national currency, expenses have increased sharply. All payments made in foreign currency have increased due to the decline in foreign exchange rates. Based on these reasons, the company has no choice but to request an increase in fares to seek remedy. The case was discussed in a closed-door meeting of the Municipal Council's Public Utilities Committee. The result was that the request was deemed appropriate and should be approved. It was submitted to the council's regular meeting on the 8th of this month and passed, and will be implemented from the 26th of this month.

### The "January 28th" Donation Campaign

The Shanghai Municipal Thrift Movement Committee, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Shanghai Youth Federation, and other organizations, in order to actively express the commemorative significance of the 10th anniversary of the "January 28th" Songhu War, specially resolved to launch the "January 28th" Donation Campaign, and jointly issued a letter to the compatriots of this city, which reads:

National Alarm Bell

"The anniversary of the January 28th Songhu War is approaching again. When we recall the pain inflicted upon us by a certain party ten years ago, we feel indescribable anger. Although this battle was not successful, it served as a national alarm bell. It awakened our compatriots from their drunken stupor, broke the traditional concept of selfishness and self-interest, and from that time on, every one of our compatriots began to understand that the nation had reached the final moment of life and death, forcing everyone to embark on a common struggle to save the nation from peril.

Donation Campaign

Now, as we are in the process of carrying out and striving to complete this great historical task, we should have an active expression to welcome this painful but glorious memorial day, especially our compatriots living in an isolated island, should make a great contribution to the struggling motherland. Therefore, we are launching the January 28th Donation Campaign, donating all the income of this day to the government, in order to enhance the strength of the war and complete the great cause of nation-building. This is an easy task, and we sincerely hope that compatriots from all walks of life will respond enthusiastically and donate generously."

### Japanese Merchant's Tugboat Sinks in the Suzhou Creek

According to the English-language "China Press," the Japanese merchant's tugboat "Wujiang No. 7" collided with a fully loaded cargo ship in the Suzhou Creek near Jiangxi Road Bridge at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 10th), causing it to sink. Salvage efforts began this morning (the 11th). The tugboat sustained a large hole from the collision, while the other ship suffered only minor damage. Fortunately, no one was injured in the incident. Yesterday, passersby saw the sunken Japanese tugboat, which was quite a sight. About three-quarters of the ship was submerged in the dirty water of the Suzhou Creek, while the Japanese flag on the ship could still be seen above the water. Salvage workers inspected the site this morning, and it is expected that the sunken tugboat will be recovered in the next day or two.

### Chinese Constable Leaves Post to Urinate, Captain Checks Post and Confrontation Ensues, Captain Insists Chinese Constable Intended to Assault Him, Trial Held Yesterday, Constable Sentenced to Detention, Special Alert at Jing'an Temple Police Station the Night Before Last, Strict Security at Court Yesterday, No Audience Allowed

The night before last, there was a sudden and serious alert at the Jing'an Temple Police Station in the Public Concession. At the time, a large number of armed detectives and Chinese and Western police officers from the reserve team, as well as red guards, were dispatched, patrolling back and forth around the police station, making the situation very serious. According to reporters, this alert was caused by a conflict between a Chinese constable and a Western deputy captain.

Leaving Post to Urinate

The Chinese constable Bai Guifang from Xuzhou, stationed at the Jing'an Temple Police Station, was assigned to patrol at the end of Xinzha Road at 8:40 AM the day before yesterday, along with Chinese constables Nos. 2480 and 2527, and Indian constable No. 158 as their leader. At that time, the Western deputy captain, Russian Kekang Siji, passed by on a motorcycle patrol and saw that Constable Bai was not at his post. He asked the Indian constable, who replied that he had left to urinate. After a while, Constable Bai arrived. The Western captain said that he should not have left his post without permission and for ten minutes, and that he would report it for punishment. Constable Bai said that he had obtained permission from the Indian constable to go to urinate, and it was only two or three minutes, so he should not deliberately lie. A conflict arose during the conversation.

Gun Discharges

It escalated to pushing each other. The Western captain accused him of trying to pull out his gun and ordered the Indian constable to take the gun from Constable Bai. During the struggle for the gun, it suddenly went off, making a loud bang. The bullet was fired, fortunately pointing downwards, and no one was injured. As a result, the gun was taken away, and Constable Bai was taken to the police station. At that time, other Chinese constables who heard about it expressed their dissatisfaction and gathered without dispersing. The police station feared an accident, so they increased security. Yesterday morning, Constable Bai was escorted by the police station to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court, and prosecuted under Article 305 of the Criminal Code for obstructing freedom with violence. Hundreds of Chinese constables, indignant, also went to the court to listen, so the entrance of the First Special Court was also heavily guarded.

Strict Security

The situation in the courtroom was even more serious. The chief of the police station, Gaxu, the Chinese head constable, Liu Ya'ying, and the Western judicial police chief, Huai Tuo, personally supervised the Chinese and Western detectives to maintain order in the court. The case was the last one, and it was not until around 11:00 AM that Judge Meng Tingke interrogated him. However, because all the Chinese constables were gathered in the court to listen, the situation was tense, and it was inconvenient for the trial, so Judge Meng declared that listening was prohibited, and all irrelevant people were asked to leave. The Chinese constables initially sat still and did not move, but after being persuaded with reason, they left the courtroom, but still gathered outside the court, waiting for a fair trial.

Disobeying Orders

The defendant, Chinese Constable Bai Guifang, No. 2725, hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang as his defense attorneys. First, Judge Meng asked about his age and origin. Then, the police station's lawyers Peng Qixin and Jiang Baolian stated the case, accusing the defendant of disobeying his superior's orders and beating the Western deputy captain Kekang Siji with a police baton, violating Article 305 of the Criminal Code. According to the translation of the statement submitted by the Western deputy captain Kekang Siji, "Yesterday morning at 8:40, I was patrolling to the post on Xinzha Road and saw that the defendant was not there. I asked Indian constable No. 158, who said that the defendant left to urinate at 8:05. Five minutes later, the defendant came out of a teahouse. I immediately went to meet him, intending to record the facts. Unexpectedly, the defendant raised his hand to touch his gun and uttered dirty words, saying he would kill me."

Gun Discharges

"At that time, two other Chinese constables and one Indian constable stepped forward to take the gun. Suddenly, it went off. Later, one of them took the gun and handed it to me, but the defendant still wanted to take it back and took out a police baton, pulled on my cuff, and beat my arm, scolding me as a 'Russian bastard.' So, I twisted him into the police station to report," etc. The defendant confessed, "Because I wanted to urinate, I informed the Indian constable and temporarily left my post, and returned in only two or three minutes. At that time, the Western deputy captain asked me where I had gone. I replied that I had urinated. He immediately accused me of slacking off for ten minutes and insisted on reporting it for punishment. I expressed my dissatisfaction because I had informed the Indian constable about leaving my post to urinate, and it was only two or three minutes. Now, the captain insisted on reporting ten minutes, which was against his conscience. So, I said to him, 'If you tell a lie, you might be killed by a gun.'"

Did Not Draw Gun

"In other words, I patted the gun with my hand, but did not take it out. The Western captain misunderstood and, together with the Chinese and Indian constables, stepped forward and took my gun, causing the gun to go off. I have no enmity with the Western captain, why would I kill him with a gun for such a trivial matter? I did not insult him or beat him with a police baton," etc. According to the testimony of Chinese constables Nos. 2480 and 2527, the defendant did not draw his gun, nor did he beat the Western captain. However, the Indian constable No. 158 stated that the defendant did draw his gun to load bullets and used a police baton to beat him. After the debate by the lawyers of both parties, Judge Meng announced the verdict in court: Bai Guifang was sentenced to 30 days of detention. If he can pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it will be calculated at one yuan per day, with a two-year suspended sentence.

### Xiecheng Rice Shop in Zhabei Illegally Obtains Border Pass, Purchases Thirty Bags of Saigon Rice Above the Price Limit, Apprentice Who Was to Transport Rice to Zhabei for Permit Arrested

Authorities in the Concessions, in view of the soaring prices of rice in the city, traced the cause and found that most of it was caused by rice merchants hoarding and manipulating prices, which directly affected the livelihood of civilians and indirectly contributed to unrest. In order to suppress rice prices, in addition to assessing and setting price limits, restrictions such as requiring permits for transporting rice out of the Concessions were implemented. Recently, many rice merchants have been arrested and sentenced to severe punishments by the First Special Court for trading above the price limit. As a result, rice prices have been slightly stabilized in recent days. However, the police authorities have not relaxed their efforts. In addition to ordering a large number of detectives to secretly investigate rice storage in warehouses to find out the big hoarders, they are also strictly investigating those who sell above the price limit. Huang Heting, the owner of Xiecheng Rice Shop at No. 50 Datong Road, Zhabei, recently purchased 30 bags of No. 2 Saigon rice from Shengxing Rice Shop at No. 467 Jiangxi Road, at a price of 83 yuan per picul, exceeding the price limit by 1.5 yuan per picul.

Xiecheng's Purchase

This rice was originally intended to be transported to Zhabei, but according to the regulations of the Municipal Council, those who transport rice out of the Concessions must attach an invoice, fill out an application form, and apply to the Political Department of the Municipal Council for a border pass. However, Shengxing was unwilling to issue an invoice for this sale, which exceeded the price limit. Huang Heting had an idea and borrowed a blank invoice from Xinyuan Grain Store at No. 4 Lane 4 of Alabassett Road, filled it out himself, stating 50 bags of Saigon rice, valued at 4,500 yuan, and later changed it to 30 bags, indicating that the price was 83 yuan per picul. On the application form, he stated that the goods were

Stored at Xinyuan

And he planned to send apprentice Zhu Huibin to the Political Department to apply for a border pass. Unexpectedly, the head Chinese detective Mao Guobao and detective Li Bijun of the department discovered the above, and further found that the rice was not stored at Xinyuan, but at the Roosevelt warehouse. This incident not only involved selling above the price limit, but also suspected of illegally obtaining a border pass. Therefore, Li Huibin was detained and sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police station's lawyer, Fang Fushu, requested that he be detained for further investigation of the principal offender.

Investigation and Arrest

After Judge Pei's interrogation, he ordered that Zhu Huibin be detained for one week for further questioning. It is reported that the police station is investigating all relevant principal offenders in this case and intends to prosecute them. In the near future, a large number of hoarders and rice profiteers may face the severe sanctions of the two regulations, "Measures for Assessing Prices and Suppressing Manipulation and Speculation in Extraordinary Times" and "Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry and Commerce." With the utmost efforts of the Municipal Council, it is expected that the rice market in this city can be suppressed in the shortest possible time.

To Suppress Prices

If the rice profiteers are still unrepentant, only know how to line their own pockets, disregard the suffering of the people, and continue to act recklessly without repentance, then the suffering of imprisonment will come immediately. By then, their reputation will be ruined, and even if they want to repent, it will be too late.

### Royal Daughters' Society Raises 50,000 Yuan

The Royal Daughters' Society of America in this city held a fundraising campaign at the beginning of this year to mark its 50th anniversary, with a target of 50,000 yuan. Since its launch, it has been going on for ten days, and yesterday the society announced that it has received donations of 7,400 yuan and 5 British pounds, and 37 people are willing to donate a considerable amount each month to cover the society's expenses. According to the society, it was established 50 years ago as a branch of the International Order Society, which is headquartered in New York, USA. Its initial scope was quite small, but after years of planning and operation, it gradually expanded and became a central relief organization for impoverished foreigners in this city. It established a hospital on Hongqiao Road with more than 40 patients, and also held charity events to provide clothing, medicine, and accommodation. Its members visit patients in more than 70 hospitals in this city every week. Recently, due to the depletion of funds, various tasks are on the verge of being suspended. Fortunately, the Municipal Council has agreed to subsidize the society's office expenses and subsidize patients with early-stage lung disease in the hospital. However, this is only a drop in the bucket and is not enough to solve the problem. Last year, monthly expenses reached 4,500 yuan, so a fundraising campaign was specially held. The society's authorities believe that fundraising is not an easy task, but because the number of people in need of relief is increasing day by day, this is the only way to save the general population from their suffering. Therefore, they have to make an urgent appeal to all sectors, hoping that people from all walks of life will donate generously. The branch's address is at No. 868 Fuxu Road.

### Economic Essays

— Feng Liutang

Kerosene (2) (Continued from July 7)

Before electric lights were popular, kerosene lamps were the only best tool for lighting. There are table lamps and wall lamps, with white porcelain shades and brass decorations, and the patterns are also exquisitely carved, so they are quite beautiful. Because kerosene is necessary for daily use, and its supply is in the hands of foreign merchants, kerosene was once the target of hoarding and speculation in the late Guangxu years. At that time, the kerosene market was also one of the market prices in various newspapers. Therefore, there were many people who lost their family fortunes.

The name and use of kerosene were seen in ancient China. The Biography of the Ancient City States in the New History of the Five Dynasties says:

"In the fifth year of Zhou Xiande, the King of Champa, Yinde Man, sent an envoy, Pu Hesan, to offer eighty-four bottles of fierce fire oil and fifteen bottles of rose water, ...... Fierce fire oil is used to sprinkle on objects, and fire comes out when it gets water. Rose water comes from the Western Regions, and when it is sprinkled on clothes, the fragrance does not fade even if it is worn out."

The so-called fierce fire oil is today's kerosene, probably refined from rice! At this time, kerosene was already popular in China, so Zuo Menglu, written by Song Kangyu, says:

"Northwestern border cities and defense city warehouses all dig large ponds in the ground, more than ten feet in length and width, to store fierce fire oil. In less than a month, the pond soil is all red and yellow, and another pond is made and moved there. If it is not like this, the fire will burn from the roof pillars. It is said that the fierce fire oil comes from thousands of miles east of Goryeo. When the sun first comes out, because of the heat of the summer sun, the rocks are extremely hot and the liquid comes out. Other objects will catch fire when they encounter it, but only true chalcedony utensils can store it. West of the Zhongshan Fuzhi is a large pond, which the county people call Haizi. I still remember the county commander going there to inspect the naval battle and test the fierce fire oil. On the other bank of the pond was the Hu people's camp. The oil user dripped the oil from the fire flame, and the raging flames suddenly broke out, and the Hu camp was completely destroyed in an instant. The remaining power of the oil entered the water, and the algae were all gone, and the fish and turtles died when they encountered it."

This statement of the function of fierce fire oil is not different from today's kerosene. There are also mentions of Annam producing fierce fire oil in historical books. It is important to know that Annam and Champa are now considered to be one place. Other miscellaneous records say:

"Fierce fire oil tree resin, produced in the Buddha Da Ni Kingdom, is very similar to camphor, but it can corrode human muscles. When burned and placed in water, the light and flame are more intense. The barbarians use it to make fire weapons, and its edge is very sharp. The sails, masts, and towers cannot stop extending, so even fish and turtles will be smelted when they encounter it."

This is not oil, but a kind of resin that can produce a great fire, so it is compared to fierce fire oil.

But in ancient times, it was also known to be a mineral, so there was the saying of petroleum. For example, it is said:

"There is petroleum in the territory of Fuyan. The old saying is that Zhisui comes from Gaonu County, which is it. It grows in the sandy stone by the water, mixed with spring water, and comes out in a daze. The locals use pheasant feathers to scoop it up and put it in a can. It is very similar to pure lacquer, and it burns like hemp, but the smoke is very thick, and all the roofs and curtains that are stained are black."

This is said to be crude petroleum, and its origin is where petroleum is produced in Shaanxi and Gansu today.

Since kerosene is popular, the tinplate dustpan is a product of the times. The dustpans used in China in the old days were either woven from bamboo strips or made of wood. Each half of the kerosene tank, cut diagonally, can be used as two dustpans, which are more durable than bamboo and wood, and unexpectedly become daily household items. There are also two kerosene iron boxes combined into one box to store clothes. Recently, there are also special ones made of galvanized white iron. In the past, Chinese vegetable oil was packaged in baskets or in huge changes. In recent years, oil shops in Shanghai have also used kerosene cans to sell raw oil and soybean oil. Large ones are packaged in large iron barrels. Therefore, the oil market is also divided into three types, one is the price per hundred catties (or the price per catty), one is the number that can be bought per yuan, and the other is the number sold per can. The weight of a large can of oil is 28 catties on the Sima scale and about 32 on the market scale.

The tinplate box of kerosene is called "tin", which is translated from the word Tin. Tin is also used to refer to utensils made of tinplate, so biscuits, etc., are also called tin when they are packed in tinplate boxes and cans, such as a tin of biscuits, a tin of kerosene, and so on.

### Talking About Interest

— Yong

Dear little brothers and sisters! Today I want to talk to you about the issue of interest. What I am about to say may not be golden words, but if you are willing to accept it, you will definitely gain something.

"Read when you are studying, play when you are playing." These two Western sayings tell us that we must be focused in everything we do, whether it is studying or playing. After understanding these two sentences, we should further understand that games should pay attention to interest, while reading should absolutely not be dominated by interest. Isn't that right? Because we seek interest to play games, so games must pay attention to interest; but can we say that we seek interest to read? Since we do not seek interest to read, then is it not necessary to consider interest when reading? Not necessarily. Eight out of ten children often fail to achieve satisfactory results in mathematics, mostly because children are not interested in mathematics. Let interest help reading, but not let interest dominate reading. You have a common problem: when you get a book, regardless of whether it is meaningful or not, as long as the content is exciting or the illustrations are rich, you are interested in reading it. On the other hand, no matter how meaningful a book is, if it has no illustrations or the material is boring, you feel disappointed. Can such reading be said to be not dominated by interest? Create interest in meaningful books, and knowledge will increase day by day, and reading will have rapid progress. I hope that all children can follow this path and continue to work hard!

### How to Ask Parents for Money

— Zuo Hui

Asking parents for money often leads to rejection. Children, do you think that parents are always so unreasonable? I think you should know some of the ways to ask parents for money!

I often see many children gathered next to vendors at the school gate, buying some dirty mushrooms and squid to chew on. You should know that these snacks are harmful to your health. Then, for the sake of loving you, would your parents be willing to give you money casually? Therefore, the first thing to do when asking parents for money is not to buy snacks. You also have to explain the reasons well when asking for money. When parents see that you are making sense, how can they refuse! However, the reasons cannot be fabricated, because if you deceive your parents once, and they find out a second time, they will never give you money again!

Some families are relatively poor, so children should understand the suffering of their parents and be considerate of them. Don't be like other rich children. You should work harder in your studies. In this way, your parents will deeply love you, and when you occasionally need money, your parents will not refuse.

Also, when your parents are angry, children must not reach out. Otherwise, not only will you not get money, but you may even be scolded severely. At that time, even if you want money for a legitimate purpose, you will not be able to say anything.

### Confucius Practicing Prayers as a Child (Illustrated by Minhua)

### The Selfish Giant

— Qichen

Once upon a time, there was a selfish giant who had a beautiful garden. Inside were beautiful flowers, green grass, tall trees, singing birds, and honey-collecting bees. Every afternoon after school, countless children would come to play.

Unfortunately! One day, this selfish giant came back. He saw these many children playing in his garden. So he drove them out and built a big wall around it. He even erected a sign at the gate that read: "Trespassers will be prosecuted!"

Spring came! Everywhere was blooming with flowers and was very beautiful, but only this garden was still winter. The flowers and plants did not grow, and the birds did not sing. The snow covered the garden, and the branches seemed to have been sprayed with silver, all covered in frost, and the wind howled fiercely.

"Why doesn't spring come to my garden?" The selfish giant often looked at his garden and sighed, "I wish the weather would change for a while!"

But not only did spring not come, neither did autumn or summer. It was always winter: wind, frost, and snow.

One morning, he had just woken up in bed when he suddenly heard a very beautiful music in his garden. "Oh! I know that spring will come after all!" He jumped up happily and went to the window to look.

He saw a small hole in the high wall, and many children were climbing in one by one. A child was sitting on each tree in the garden. The trees were full of flowers, the ground was covered with grass, many birds were flying and singing in the trees, and swarms of bees were busy collecting honey—spring had really arrived!

Only then did he realize why spring had never come before. "I will tear down this high wall! And open the front door of the garden!" He shouted and ran into the garden. Many children saw the giant coming and all ran away. The entire garden became winter again.

After he tore down the high wall and opened the front door, many children came in again. The garden suddenly turned into spring again.

"This garden belongs to you forever! Children!" The selfish giant shouted and began to play with the children. The garden became as beautiful as before.

### Impressions of a Shuttlecock Kicking Competition

— Mengbai

Cun De Elementary and Middle School on Guba Road can be considered a well-run private school in Shanghai. Principal Xu Wenxiang has spared no effort in promoting school affairs. Therefore, in recent years, the number of young people seeking education there has been increasing. Recently, in order to promote the sport of kicking shuttlecock, the school held another school-wide shuttlecock kicking competition the day before yesterday, which was very interesting. The author made a special trip to visit, so here, I will write some of my impressions below.

On that morning, the shuttlecock kicking competition started at 8:30 AM. Each grade selected five male and five female representatives. The school's physical education teacher served as the judge, and each person kicked twice. These students, after two months of practice in kicking shuttlecock, were already very skilled. They could skillfully play the shuttlecock on their hands or feet, using various techniques such as "pan," "guai," and "reverse kick." However, for the sake of simplicity, the competition only compared the "jumping kick." Among the various ways of kicking shuttlecock, the "jumping kick" is the most difficult, but as a result, a certain student from junior high school was able to kick dozens of times in a row. Therefore, the male and female championships were both won by students from the first year of junior high school. Probably the smaller the person, the more lively they kick, so the students from the larger second and third year of junior high school were not able to kick better than the students from the first year!

According to the school authorities, the reason for promoting kicking shuttlecock is because they see that in winter, kicking shuttlecock is one of the best sports. When kicking, the whole body exercises, which is undoubtedly very beneficial to health. Moreover, even on very cold days, a few kicks of the shuttlecock will warm the whole body. Especially in their school, where the playground is not very large, students easily break glass or kick people when playing ball games. As for kicking shuttlecock, there will be no such things happening. Even if the shuttlecock sometimes falls on someone's head, it is not very painful. After hearing this, I felt that kicking shuttlecock is indeed a sport suitable for winter and worth promoting. I hope that all children will not ignore this beneficial sport.

### Many Money

— Cuba

Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had three very lazy sons. One day, the farmer was dying and without hesitation called his three sons to his side and told them that there was a lot of money hidden in the field. He said: "You go to cultivate the field, and you will be able to find them in the soil." After hearing these words, the three sons excitedly asked their father where the money was hidden. They wanted to become millionaires without putting in any effort, but their father only replied: "Go cultivate the field."

After the father died, the three sons buried him and then hurried to the field to work hard digging the soil. The neighboring farmers were all surprised by the actions of these three children. They wondered why they, who had not tilled an inch of soil before, were now working so hard. They picked up every stone in the soil and threw it away. They dug for a long time, but there was no trace of any money. They thought that their labor was wasted.

When the following year came, their harvest in the field exceeded past records, and it was more abundant than any other farmland. At this time, they understood what their father meant. They realized that only through diligent work could they obtain money, and lazy children could never become millionaires.

From then on, they were no longer lazy. They worked hard in every season, and every year their harvest was better than that of the national villages, and they themselves became very strong men.

### Fourth Place in Elementary School Students' Summer Homework Competition: My Father

— Xiangyao Elementary School, Bu Mufang

My family is a semi-farming, semi-studying family. My father likes to read and also knows how to farm. He has a very gentle personality and always has a smile on his face.

His favorite things in life are planting trees and fruits, and raising poultry.

The peach, apricot, and other trees growing on the ground around our house were all planted by my father. Every spring when the flowers bloom, they surround the house in the center. The chickens and ducks under the trees roam leisurely. My father is very happy to see this.

He likes to do things himself, such as catching tree worms, sawing branches, and feeding the poultry. He never asks others to do it for him. If there are minor disputes in the village, he is also asked to mediate. So he is very busy all day long. When people ask him to rest, he always says, "I like to do it and don't feel tired."

After the August 13th Incident, our hometown was in chaos. My father had no choice but to leave his beloved home and move to Shanghai. However, the living environment in Shanghai did not suit my father's personality. Moreover, he was a very active person. After arriving in Shanghai, he was idle all day long and could only look at books to relieve his boredom.

We can tell from his rarely smiling face the suffering in his heart. His only hope is to be able to return home soon and put his efforts into rebuilding the fields.

### Recommendation of "The Story of Reuters"

— Liantai

This film is not only worth appreciating by us in the news industry, but it is also the best motto for everyone when doing things—because Reuters tells you that you should have a spirit of perseverance and a serious attitude that is not afraid of ridicule for any kind of work. Reuters was like this to his beloved wife, to his colleagues, and to the final climax in court, because he understood something with certainty.

Regardless of whether the Reuters News Agency in England now has become an official news organization or whether this organization is being used as a tool in political struggles, Jolly Reuters did not have insidious ambitions, or want to show off, or want to make a fortune. This can be seen from Reuters' repeated conversations with the banker Randolph. He once said to his beloved wife, "For the sake of the public," he wanted to announce the news of Lincoln's assassination. At the same time, in court, he said, "A free people should have newspapers that can speak freely."

Reuters also repeatedly said that news reports must be accurate and fast, and believed that the news industry is a sacred work.

I hope that people in the news industry have this spirit, and I hope that everyone has an attitude that is not afraid of failure and not afraid of ridicule.

Finally, it is worth mentioning the technique of director William Dieterle. He is the maverick director of Hollywood biographical films, with past works such as "The Story of Zola," "The Life of Emile Zola," "Juarez," and "All That Money Can Buy." As for the dubbing artist of this film, Stein, is also worthy of our praise, making the film have good sound effects.

### Reply:

To Xie Bobo: The songbook is scheduled to be published once a week. This year, because of the publication of the long novel "Zhangtai Willow," the pages of this publication have become narrower and narrower. Therefore, "Spring Comes to the World" is printed in a small half-page, and it was found afterwards that it was not clear enough. In the future, we will enlarge the plate, but the date cannot be fixed. Sincerely.

### Yin Xiucen Joins Yi Hua

— Xinggu

After Bai Hong officially left Guolian and joined Jin Xing, followed by Mei Xi and Sun Min also leaving the Guolian Company, now Yin Fatty (Xiucen) has also completed his contract with Guolian, and is preparing not to renew it and seek other developments.

It is said that Yin Fatty has been in the film circle for a full ten years. He is from Beiping. When Lianhua Company went to Ping to set up the Fifth Branch and recruited film talent training institutes, Fatty signed up and took the exam. After being fortunately admitted, he officially entered the screen.

His first film to appear on the screen was "New Grievances of the Forbidden City." Yin Xiucen played a funny villain with a weight of 285 pounds. After the completion of "New Grievances of the Forbidden City," he came to Shanghai and entered Lianhua First Factory. After the war, he joined Xinhua and filmed "Beggar's Daughter" and "Cold Moon Poetry Soul."

Yin Xiucen's performances in all previous films have been very satisfactory, and he is considered to be an actor who can act very well. However, his talent has always been buried by directors and cannot be fully utilized, so he wants to seek other developments.

Initially, it was Yi Hua Company who contacted him through Wang Long. If Yin Xiucen joined Yi Hua together with Han Langen, Hong Jingling, and Zhang Zhizhi, Yi Hua would be willing to pay a monthly salary of 1,500 yuan for the four of them, and the remuneration for each film would be given separately. However, in fact, Han Langen holds an important position in Guolian and will inevitably not be able to leave Xinhua to join Yi Hua. Therefore, Yi Hua is very interested in recruiting Yin Xiucen alone. At the same time, Yin Xiucen is also very willing to transfer to Yi Hua. Recently, negotiations are underway on the matter of monthly salary, and the opinions are very close. However, Yin's contract with Xinhua still has one week left, so the contract with Yi Hua must be signed one week later. Generally speaking, this matter will not change again.

### Film City News You Need to Know

That evening, Liu Rushi had many thoughts running through her mind. Unexpectedly, while she was hurrying to leave, Qian Muzhai returned the next day. How could Liu Rushi not be delighted? She then spoke secretly with Muzhai for a long time in the room, strongly urging Muzhai to respond to Huang Yuqi and jointly raise a righteous army. Because Jiangyin and Changshu were originally adjacent, she also wanted Muzhai to draft a proclamation. How cautious was Muzhai? As timid as a mouse, how could he rashly raise an army? He then said that he was a scholar, without military power, how could he suddenly raise a righteous army? If things went wrong, it would only lead to regret. Yuqi had previously started an uprising in Jiangyin and failed, killing many innocent people. This was a profound lesson. Therefore, he was unwilling to draft this proclamation. Liu Rushi was greatly disappointed again. After much persuasion, she finally agreed to donate family wealth to support military expenses. He would wait for Huang Yuqi to take Jiangyin, then observe the situation to determine his allegiance. This was also Qian Muzhai's cunning. Liu Rushi had no choice but to volunteer to go to sea to reward the troops and encourage morale, intending to take this opportunity to express her grievances to Huang Yuqi. Muzhai initially refused to let her go, thinking it was a dangerous matter. Liu Rushi said, "With Shi Da's help, I will certainly be safe. If you cannot immediately respond yourself, nor let me go, then I will die before you, unwilling to endure this infamous reputation any longer." Muzhai saw that Liu Rushi's attitude was very firm and had to allow Rushi to go secretly, but absolutely not to reveal it. After the couple had agreed, Liu Rushi accompanied Muzhai downstairs to see Shi Da. Shi Da reiterated his request for Muzhai to support the action, and Muzhai gave a vague response. Liu Rushi then told Shi Da that she was willing to go to sea to reward the troops, to meet Huang Yuqi, and provide some military supplies, asking for Shi Da's protection. Shi Da gladly said, "It is best if Madam Liu can go. I have a seagoing ship anchored outside Jiangyin, which can take Madam Liu along. At this moment, Lord Huang has probably left Zhoushan." (33)

### Words on Self-Cultivation (9)

Of the things in the world that do not go as one wishes, eight or nine out of ten are common. If one is imprisoned by unpleasantness and harbors melancholy, then one will have little joy in life. If worry can harm a person, one's life cannot be sustained, how can there be ample spirit to engage in struggle! Therefore, having a broad mind and forgetting everything is a fundamental virtue of life.
