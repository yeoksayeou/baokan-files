### Hull Meets with British, Australian, and Dutch Envoys to Review the Situation in Europe and Asia; Britain Determined to Vigorously Protect its Interests in the Pacific; Dutch Envoy Declares to Resist Aggression with Force

Washington - Secretary of State Hull met with Dutch Minister Loudon yesterday, and told reporters that the Dutch East Indies will resist aggression with force. At the same time, British Ambassador Lord Halifax and Australian Minister Casey said after meeting with Hull that British military strength in the Far East is steadily increasing. In yesterday's meetings, State Department officials studied the Far East situation and instructed U.S. consulates to order American ships in the Far East to carry extra passengers when necessary. The situation in the Balkans was also discussed yesterday. Loudon stated that he had no knowledge of the alleged new business demands made by Japan to the Dutch East Indies. During the meeting between Halifax and Hull, events outside the Pacific were also discussed. Afterwards, he told people, "We can very well assume that the British government is extremely concerned with maintaining affairs in the Pacific so that they do not fall apart. We have been working hard on this for a long time." The outside world considers the meeting between Hull, Halifax, and Casey to be extremely important. (United Press dispatch of the 16th)

Washington - The authorities have instructed U.S. consulates to order American vessels to accommodate extra passengers when necessary in order to evacuate American citizens from the Far East. The State Department held several meetings yesterday to review the progress of the situation in the Near East and the Balkans. The State Department's meetings included a three-way meeting between Secretary of State Hull, British Ambassador to the U.S. Lord Halifax, and Australian Minister to the U.S. Casey. Before the meetings, Lord Halifax visited Under Secretary of State Welles for a fifteen-minute conversation. Afterwards, neither of them was willing to disclose the content of the conversation. Welles also had a brief conversation with the Yugoslavian Minister. The Dutch Minister is seeking a meeting with Secretary of State Hull. The State Department has authorized U.S. consulates to issue emergency certificates allowing passengers to find accommodation in public rooms and other parts of ships that do not normally carry passengers, in order to facilitate the evacuation of American citizens from the Far East. The Coolidge President, which previously only carried 900 passengers, is now allowed to carry 1,200. Observers believe that the State Department does not intend to dispatch any special evacuation ships to the Far East. Officials here have recently compiled statistics showing that there are approximately 6,174 American citizens in China, approximately 2,000 in Japan, 1,547 in Hong Kong, and approximately 128 in Vietnam. (United Press dispatch of the 16th)

Washington - The Dutch Minister to the U.S. said that in the event of war in the Pacific, there are many rumors regarding the position of the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, he was ordered by the government to clearly express that if the Dutch East Indies is attacked by Japan, it will fight with all its might. He also hinted that the Dutch East Indies will not be without friendly nations to rely on in such an event. (International News Service dispatch of the 16th)

### Allegations of Japanese Ultimatum: Dutch East Indies Officially Denies

Batavia - The Dutch East Indies government officially denied yesterday evening that it had received a Japanese ultimatum. It is claimed that the talks currently being conducted by the delegations of the two countries are awaiting development, and there have been no changes in the situation. Officials have withdrawn the order to send Dutch ships to temporarily berth in neutral ports. No explanation was given as to why the order was issued or why it was withdrawn. According to reports, earlier this week, the Navy Department had ordered all Dutch ships in the Pacific to sail north to the Philippines and ordered several ships to sail to Manila or other neutral ports. (United Press dispatch of the 16th)

Tokyo - The captain of a Japanese ship that recently arrived here from the Dutch East Indies said that the anxiety of the people in the Dutch East Indies and the tension of the situation are greater than what is known in China. This anxiety can be seen from various preventive measures. All itineraries of Dutch ships are kept secret. Dutch ships often change their routes and head to neutral ports. Japanese people traveling in the Dutch East Indies are under close surveillance. Telephone conversations are only allowed to be conducted in Dutch and English. The 20,000-ton "Oranje" mega-ship, completed at the outbreak of the war, is constantly on standby to evacuate civilians from Surabaya in an emergency, which shows a glimpse of the authorities' panic. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 16th)

London - Responsible diplomatic sources reported yesterday that Japanese warships sailing from Hainan Island are patrolling off the coast of Thailand. (United Press received the same report from Saigon). (United Press dispatch of the 16th)

Vichy - It is believed here that Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese war is a further indication of preparations for an attack on the Dutch East Indies. It is claimed that there are currently ten Japanese warships docked in Bangkok, and other Japanese warships are on their way. It is generally believed that Japan will demand naval and air bases as a reward for mediation, as Japan can use these bases to fight against the East Indies, Burma, and Singapore. By using these bases, Japan can make demands to make all of Thailand a Japanese territory. It is believed here that if Japan's situation is favorable, this demand is almost certain to be made. It is claimed that Japan expects that Britain and the United States will only issue protests on paper, and it is rumored that Japan believes that such protests will be too late to prevent Japan's southward advance.

Calcutta - The Prime Minister of Bengal, Huq, stated yesterday that the government will make arrangements to evacuate women and children from Calcutta in the event of an enemy attack.

### Mines Laid in Singapore Strait; Britain Officially Advises Evacuation of Overseas Chinese in Thailand

London - The Admiralty announced today that mines have been laid at the eastern entrance of the Singapore Strait and issued a notice stating that navigation in certain designated areas is dangerous. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)

Bangkok - According to Japanese sources, Britain has concentrated over 20,000 troops and 150 aircraft along the Thai-Burmese and Thai-Malayan borders, which has caused great anxiety among the Thai people regarding possible British military action. Britain has also begun an "economic offensive" against Thailand, engaging in restricting or prohibiting the export of oil, rice, lead, rubber, and other important goods to Japan in order to undermine Thailand's economic system. Well-informed sources criticize Britain's activities, saying that Britain has abandoned its recent gentle attempt to induce Thailand to join its sphere of influence and instead used the above-mentioned means to threaten Thailand into submission. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)

Bangkok - The British Embassy here advised British women and children yesterday to leave Thailand as soon as possible. This warning follows declarations made by London and Bangkok, stating that relations between the two countries are excellent after the recent signing of a non-aggression treaty. Last Saturday, official news was released in London and Bangkok expressing the hope that friendly relations could be maintained between Thailand and China. At the same time, the Thai government released a message assuring the public that the current tension in the Far East would not involve Thailand and urged the entire country to remain calm and work to make Thailand self-sufficient. Bangkok's official radio broadcast denied reports that Japan had demanded naval bases from Thailand and stated that both Britain and Japan are "peace-loving." The radio also stated that Japan's intervention in the Thai-Vietnamese dispute was originally intended to establish peace in the region, so Japan does not seem likely to attack Thailand. (Associated Press dispatch of the 16th)

### Rumors that China and Britain are Conducting Secret Military Negotiations, Including the Establishment of a Joint Defense Line to Counter Japan's Southward Advance

Tokyo - The "Yomiuri Shimbun" published today a message from Bangkok stating that giants are currently negotiating a secret military agreement with Yu Qing. It is claimed that the agreement is an attempt to maintain British influence in the Far East and prevent Japan's southward advance. The reporter also said that Britain has decided to prevent cooperation between Japan and Thailand because Britain sees Japan's intervention in the Thai-Vietnamese dispute as a sign that Thailand is joining Japan's "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The rumored Sino-British agreement will include the establishment of a joint defense line between the Chongqing government and Singapore to counter Japan's southward advance and increase the supply of ammunition to China via the Yunnan-Burma Road. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" also received a message from Bangkok stating that Britain is concentrating 20,000 troops on the Malayan and Burmese borders to threaten Thailand and undermine Japanese-Thai relations. (Associated Press dispatch of the 16th)

### Indian Newspapers Pay Attention to the Far East Situation and Advocate for War Preparations Against Japan

Mumbai - Indian newspapers have unanimously paid great attention to the sudden developments in the Far East situation. The "Political Review" recognizes the Japanese threat in the Pacific as a serious event, saying that some people view Japan's continuous threats to Britain and the United States as empty threats, but we do not want to hold this self-comforting view, because in fact, the Japanese government is now mired in its southern policy and it is almost impossible for it to withdraw, or at least not possible for a while. The "Times of India" editorial advocates for war preparations, saying that if Japan wants to advance south, it will take great risks, because in the course of its southern advance, it is bound to go to war with the United States. It is very dangerous for us to be optimistic if we are not prepared for the extension of war to the Pacific. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)

### U.S. Supplies Aircraft to Britain; Stimson Expresses Support

Washington - Secretary of War Stimson recently sent a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee stating that the expansion of the U.S. aircraft manufacturing industry is due to Britain and France purchasing aircraft from the U.S. Stimson supports the policy of supplying warplanes to Britain and said that he wanted to clarify his position because something published in a Washington newspaper recently misunderstood his views. Stimson also said that if Britain and France had not ordered aircraft from the U.S. and enabled the U.S. aircraft manufacturing industry to engage in production, the situation in the U.S. would be very serious with regard to the equipment for manufacturing aircraft needed to cope with future crises. Stimson's letter stated, "Within a period of four to six months, we expect the delivery of new warplanes ordered by the Air Force to be accelerated. These aircraft are equipped with the latest inventions learned from actual combat experience. Sometimes, if the delivery of a certain type of aircraft is delayed by several months, and newer equipment can be obtained, we also feel that it is better to delay. This can ensure that the aircraft obtained by our Air Force are not obsolete when they are delivered. Regarding examples of the U.S. government benefiting from delayed deliveries, I will cite one example: Last December, we ordered many B-24 bombers, expecting the first batch to be delivered in December. In order to allow the aircraft manufacturer to deliver the same type of aircraft to Britain first, we agreed to delay our delivery date by several months. In return for our move, Britain immediately gave us a large number of aircraft engines, which we urgently needed for our Air Force. Therefore, the delayed delivery not only enabled us to complete the Flying Fortresses and other types of aircraft that we could not complete before due to the lack of engines, but also, finally, our B-24 aircraft were delivered with improvements developed in the delay due to the war situation, the latter being the most important item. In other words, our assistance to Britain in creating an air force that is now expected to cope with this year's crisis not only increases Britain's national defense strength and strengthens our protection, but also allows us to engage in production, so that even if Britain fails in the future, and we are hit for the first time, we will be stronger." (Associated Press dispatch of the 16th)

Washington - According to the New York Tribune, Roosevelt has decided to supply Britain with more destroyers. The U.S. Navy is currently repairing 46 old destroyers to be shipped to Britain. (TASS dispatch of the 16th)

### U.S. Will Increase Taxes to Finance National Defense Expenses; Secret Consultations Between Vinson, Stark, and Others; Plan to Build Fortifications on Pacific Islands

Washington - Officials revealed last night that government leaders are now secretly planning to increase federal taxes by 25 percent, so that an additional $3 billion in tax revenue can be added each year to finance national defense. It is understood that Treasury Secretary Morgenthau will submit a new tax bill after studying the income statistics for March and the tax situation last year. At the same time, President Roosevelt's $424 million naval bill, which is used to strengthen defenses in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and includes naval bases in Guam and Samoa, has been passed by the House Naval Affairs Committee. (International News Service dispatch of the 16th)

Washington - The House Naval Affairs Committee held a secret meeting with Chief of Naval Operations Stark for three hours yesterday to discuss plans to build fortifications on Guam, Samoa, and British islands. Committee Chairman Vinson said that Stark discussed a secret naval map. Someone asked if the current situation in the Far East is so critical, does the United States have time to build defenses on remote islands? Vinson replied that this matter should be asked of people outside the committee. (Associated Press dispatch of the 16th)

### U.S. President Reaffirms Intention to Aid Britain; Meets with Japanese Ambassador Nomura, Only Discussing the Relations Between the Two Countries in General

Tokyo - According to Washington dispatches, when Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Nomura met with Roosevelt, they did not discuss specific developments in the Far East. The conversation was limited to the general relationship between Japan and the U.S. It is reported that the President expressed his willingness to maintain relations between the two countries on a friendly basis and believed that conflicts between the two countries could still be avoided if all issues between the two sides could be discussed on the basis of mutual willingness to maintain friendship. The President also reaffirmed the U.S.'s intention to continue to aid Britain by all possible means except for participating in the war, and emphasized the U.S.'s deep concern for China, which has increased because it believes that the war in China and the war in Europe have become part of a whole war.

Editorial

### A Perspective on the Far East Crisis

Three to five days ago, U.S. President Roosevelt delivered a solemn speech, once again advising the evacuation of overseas Chinese in the Far East; at the same time, the so-called mediation between Vietnam and Thailand has progressed further and obviously harbors sinister intentions, and Britain's strengthening of border defenses on the northern border of the Malay Peninsula is also obviously purposeful. These various factors have caused an atmosphere of extreme tension in the Far East situation. In the past two days, it seems that the crisis will not break out temporarily due to various explanations from all parties, and it has become slightly more stable. In this period of rapid international changes, people's nerves are stimulated by continuous events and often show some uneasy signs. All reactions often express to the greatest extent. It is not advisable to regard these as unnecessary disturbances. It is not a morbid nervousness to be cautious and prudent. However, every rational person should strive to maintain a reaction that is appropriate. For example, the President of the United States' speech a few days ago, this newspaper pointed out that it was not enough to take it as proof that the United States was about to participate in the war. With the same analysis, the current statements by various parties to refute rumors and dispel doubts are also not enough to trust that they have dispelled the shadows surrounding the South Pacific. It is expected that all the changes that will be presented to the world in the future will be more turbulent, dramatic and bizarre, and the possibilities will increase day by day. Rather than being constantly worried and joyful because of this, it is better to quietly observe the dynamics of the development of the situation, but firmly grasp its context before and after.

The so-called Far East crisis, strictly speaking, should take the first violation of the Great Power Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1931 as the starting point; and everything at present is nothing more than inheriting the legacy of that event. It was only in the past one or two years that the relevant powers realized that it had reached a point where it could no longer be tolerated or ignored. The Japanese side's expansion of this crisis from the Asian continent to the South Seas area, although it has been planning carefully for decades, the actual start of its adventure was when the European war changed dramatically last spring. In its original nature, it was completely speculative, but the resistance and repercussions of democratic countries were not considered important conditions at the time. The only future he was looking forward to was the victory of the Axis powers and the defeat of Britain, and the Tripartite Pact was signed because of the eagerness to expect this future. However, in the subsequent process, it changed from spontaneous to forced. In other words, the future of this problem is not only determined by Japan's own will, but has to advance and retreat with the Axis's movements in Europe. On the other hand, democratic countries are really forced into this situation, so they have to stop the previous plan of using tolerance as a bribe and only engage in active preparations for a firm response. The Far East dispute, which began nearly ten years ago, has now added a new and decisive factor in addition to China's rise to fight, namely, the joint resistance of democratic countries to the movement of aggression. It is not necessary to extravagantly say what the final effect of this movement will be, but at the very least, it has greatly reduced the aggressor's chances of using blitzkrieg tactics and gaining without effort. President Luo's speech a few days ago and the various emergency measures taken by the United States did shock the world, but in essence, they did play a practical role. Now, not only are Britain and the United States showing unprecedented concern and determination for the Far East, but even the Dutch East Indies, whose home country has completely fallen, has more courage than French Vietnam, which still has considerable strength in its home country, and is unwilling to repeat the mistakes of French Vietnam since last autumn. Looking back at the protagonists who created this crisis, the opportunity is far less than before, and the situation is deteriorating day by day. The only thing they rely on is the Axis camp, which is also facing increasing difficulties, and their plans are often wrong. The Nazi paratroopers who have been in the world's gaze for a long time have not yet landed in Britain, and Italy has instead suffered British paratroopers first. Under these circumstances, Germany and Italy, apart from the so-called spring offensive, which has been empty talk for a long time and still lacks clues, can hardly provide any strong response or effective support to their allies in the Far East. Therefore, judging from the various factors related to the Far East, the so-called Far East crisis, if it refers to the opposition between aggression and anti-aggression, then it is indeed in the process of becoming increasingly acute; but in terms of the trend of the situation, it is by no means an expansion of darkness and chaos, but a strengthening of the forces that maintain justice and order.

The final outcome of all these problems cannot go beyond the track of reason, but the various forms in the process of its evolution may not all conform to rational judgment. If it is believed that today's aggressors will definitely wait until the absolutely favorable opportunity and all preparations are completed before launching an attack, then that is overemphasizing reason and fundamentally ignoring the nature of aggression. Especially when the situation is bad and there is no time to choose, the power of reason to control him will be reduced to the minimum, and the more difficult the situation is, the stronger the demand for taking risks and seeking luck. Just like the previous launch of the war of aggression against China and the signing of the Tripartite Pact, were they all the result of careful consideration? Of course, most of Japan's military power is still stuck on the Chinese battlefield, but in the past it did not prevent it from launching new adventures in Zhanggufeng or Nomonghan. In fact, that kind of adventure was exactly what was needed to alleviate the poverty of the war of aggression against China. What's more, there is still the fact that the aggressive camps are colluding with each other, which cannot be easily shaken off. Therefore, even if strictly speaking from the perspective of interests, the crisis in the Pacific should not break out, and the final outcome of the outbreak is that the aggressor will inevitably avoid the doom destined by history, but in fact it has already reached the point of making a cocoon and imprisoning itself.

The democratic countries at present mostly regard whether the Dutch East Indies and Malaysia are invaded as the final juncture. President Luo's so-called forced participation in the war should be interpreted as such. But before reaching that juncture, there are also some tasks that are more important than preparing for war or evacuating overseas Chinese, such as relations with the Soviet Union. In recent days, Japan's government and the public have been very vocal about diplomacy with the Soviet Union. It is said that negotiations are in progress, and there is a tendency to abandon the anti-communist covenant in order to gain Soviet favor. Of course, the future aggressive offensive in the Far East does not have to wait for the successful adjustment of relations with the Soviet Union before it can be launched, and the situation in Eastern Europe is currently turbulent. If the Soviet Union shows a slight pretense to Japan for its own safety, it will inevitably make the extreme elements advocating southward advance even more arrogant, and promote the deterioration of the situation in the South Pacific. As pointed out in this newspaper's editorial a few days ago, this is also one of the key points in the US military strategic layout that may fall behind. It is pointless to be unnecessarily worried. I hope that people can pay great attention to this type of issue in addition to their anxiety.

### Production and Construction Outside the Pass Made Great Progress

Lanzhou: According to a senior administrative official who came here from Jiuquan, the people in various counties outside the Pass, although living in remote border areas, have undiminished patriotism like their compatriots in the interior. In the past three years, in addition to building roads to prepare for achievements, they have also made great progress in production and construction. Last year, the cotton production in Dunhuang County increased sharply, and the indigenous method of weaving cloth was widespread. The people in various places outside the Pass can basically be self-sufficient in food and clothing. In terms of grain, there is a large surplus, supplying other counties. In addition, improving animal husbandry and establishing paper factories are also being planned. (15th dispatch)

### Military Deployment Nearing Completion; German Invasion of Bulgaria Imminent; Britain Will Sever Diplomatic Relations with Bulgaria If It Materializes and Take Necessary Steps to Counter It

London: Diplomatic circles here claim that if German troops occupy Bulgaria or use Bulgaria as a base for attacking Greece, Britain will definitely sever diplomatic relations with Bulgaria and take steps it deems necessary. It is heard that the recently mobilized Bulgarian troops are now being transferred to the Turkish border, which Bulgaria does not perceive as a threat. If this is true, then Bulgaria's actions are clearly beneficial to Germany. Judging from the current situation, Germany's deployment in Bulgaria is almost complete. Bridges have been mined, food supplies have been organized, military camps have been prepared, and since last night, clothing and footwear have been restricted. Reserve soldiers of all levels in Bulgaria are secretly being summoned and trained. Many houses have been requisitioned. Local officials claim that this is purely a defensive plan. There are currently three German divisions on the southern Bulgarian border, and all the military camps on the Romanian border were taken over by German troops in the middle of last week. A large number of German troops are also gathered in Constanta and Chia, and passenger trains are on standby at any time, while large quantities of military supplies are also being transported to the Danube ports along the Bulgarian border. Austrian mountain troops continued to arrive in the Romanian capital yesterday. German medical teams have taken over Romanian hospitals. It is heard that Romanian schools will soon be converted into military hospitals. (16th Reuters dispatch)

Zurich: A diplomatic source said yesterday evening that large quantities of food are now being concentrated in several major strongholds in northern Bulgaria, and instructions have been received that all kinds of supplies must be ready before February 25. It is widely believed that these instructions indicate that German troops may enter Bulgaria on that day. Diplomatic informants say that the supplies are being gathered in several strongholds, and it does not appear that they are intended for the use of the Bulgarian army.

### Yugoslavia Takes Precautionary Measures; 700,000 Soldiers Willing to Sacrifice Their Lives for the Country

National Capital of Yugoslavia: The Regent of Yugoslavia, Prince Paul, yesterday met with Prime Minister Cvetkovic and Foreign Minister Markovic to hear detailed reports on the talks between the two politicians and Hitler. Current affairs researchers believe that Hitler and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop have made a request that Yugoslavia only guarantee its neutrality during the war. (16th Associated Press dispatch)

Yugoslav Capital City: After Yugoslav Prime Minister Cvetkovic and Foreign Minister Markovic returned to this place from Germany, they immediately convened a state council to report on the trip. As far as the food officials here know, the sole purpose of this meeting between the two giants in Germany's Berchtesgaden town was to probe what Yugoslavia intended to do when the Balkan situation was serious. In fact, as far as Yugoslavia is concerned, the question is very simple: unless it decides to join the Balkan Group, it must turn a blind eye to the passage of German troops through Bulgaria in the future. However, if German troops enter Bulgaria, Yugoslavia will be surrounded by the Axis powers and will be unable to defend itself. This situation is indeed very obvious. However, the general public here can still remain calm. As for the content of the talks between Germany and Yugoslavia, no official announcement has been made, but all sectors have expressed opposition to any concessions that weaken national unity. However, it is heard that Berlin does not expect Yugoslavia to join the Axis, and the rumor that Germany asked Yugoslavia to allow passage has also been firmly denied by the German side.

Germany Uses Land as Bait to Induce Yugoslavia to Join the Axis

National Capital of Yugoslavia: According to reliable sources here, Hitler made concrete proposals to Yugoslav cabinet members yesterday, hoping that Yugoslavia would give a concrete reply. It is heard that what Hitler has already promised Yugoslavia is: (1) the Trim River basin and Skutari town in northern Albania; (2) a corridor to join the Aegean Sea in Salonica; (3) the land around Lake Ohrid, roughly including Korçë and other towns that the Greek army has already captured. Hitler's move is nothing more than using what belongs to other countries as Germany's price for buying Balkan countries to cooperate in the new European order. Responsible people here do not believe that Hitler's proposal can be accepted by Yugoslavia. (16th Reuters dispatch)

Yugoslavia's Policy Goal: Maintain Peace and Security

Yugoslav Capital City: The political and public opinion circles here are paying close attention to the talks held between Prime Minister Cvetkovic and Foreign Minister Markovic and Leader Hitler in Obersalzberg yesterday. All newspapers commented on it this morning. The "Vreme" newspaper claimed that the talks did not make Yugoslavia's foreign policy have amazing changes. At the same time, the talks will not affect peace in the Balkans. The meeting between the politicians of Germany and Yugoslavia is just a natural result of the existing friendly relations between the two countries. Yugoslavia is Germany's neighbor, and it is deeply dependent on the German economic system. The newspaper continued that the meetings between Berlin and Paphos made Yugoslavia believe that the goal of Yugoslavia's consistent foreign policy, namely safety and peace, can be achieved.

### Britain Confirms Dispatch of Paratroopers Landing in Southern Italy; The Goal and Achievement Are Not Specified; The Italian Side Allows Captured Paratroopers to be Treated as Prisoners of War

London: A Reuters Air Force reporter said that the Italian side's claim that British paratroopers landed in southern Italy in an attempt to destroy certain targets related to the southern ports, although London has confirmed this feat today, its purpose is unclear, and what has been achieved has not yet been said. Some of those engaged in this campaign have not returned to their defenses. As the Central Army continues to advance straight to Tripoli, the Italian African Empire is gradually disintegrating, and a new offensive by Greek troops in Albania has now been launched. When the British Air Force heavily attacked the most important island base of the Mediterranean, Rhodes and Sicily, British paratroopers landed in southern Italy. Regardless of the consequences, it can also be seen as a brave strike against Mussolini. Mussolini now has clear evidence of this. The communiqué of the Italian General Command was drafted by Mussolini himself. Yesterday, Mussolini took an extraordinary step and informed the British Command that the British paratroopers who had landed in southern Italy had been captured. In fact, according to military strategy, Mussolini should have kept this matter a secret. Now, he openly said that Mussolini is probably eager to reduce the public's anxiety about Italy's susceptibility to attacks by sea, land, and air. Last night, the Italian radio station went further and said, "Italy knows what these paratroopers want to do." According to them, the target of the British paratroopers was the Abruzzo Aqueduct, which supplies water to 302 towns in Italy. The length of the canal is the first in the world. In fact, this statement is not credible to the world, and the Italians made this statement to induce the British to explain the target of their paratroopers. It is widely believed that some of the paratroopers who landed in Italy have already escaped. (16th Reuters dispatch)

London: Rome issued a semi-official document yesterday stating that some of the British paratroopers found in southern Italy will be treated as prisoners of war and detained in concentration camps, allowing representatives of international groups to visit them. (16th Reuters dispatch)

London: A warning was issued to Italy here last night that if the Italian side executes the British paratroopers who landed in southern Italy this week on the charge of espionage, Britain will immediately retaliate. At the same time, it was pointed out that for every 100 British citizens detained in Italy, Britain has approximately 10,000 Italian prisoners of war to offset them, including "23 generals."

### British Air Force Lightning Offensive – Fierce Attack on the Opposite Coast – From Calais to Boulogne, Firelight Illuminated the Sky – German Aircraft Conduct Extensive Daytime Raids on England

Folkestone, Today. A lightning offensive was launched this morning, attacking the German-occupied French coast. The dense smoke from explosions and fires made it almost impossible for reconnaissance planes to operate. There was a brief lull around midnight, but the bombing soon resumed with increased intensity. Two extremely powerful explosions shook the English coast, apparently caused by the bombing of armories. In the starlight, the British Air Force looked down on the French coast as if it were undergoing a fiery baptism. The air raid began after dusk, and in the first half-hour, British planes rained down bombs. The explosions shook houses and windows in Folkestone, and were watched across the sea by thousands of people. The sounds of artillery and explosions were like giant thunder, and the firelight and flashes illuminated the sky in a fiery red. The situation was especially severe in Boulogne, where the entire coastal area for ten miles, from Calais to Boulogne, was engulfed in flames. The English Channel was also lit up by the fire, with the burning being particularly intense in Boulogne, where flames filled the sky for dozens of miles around. A London Daily Mail reporter described the flames during the raid as "a fire on the French coast so large that it can be seen from afar, truly an unprecedented spectacle." (United Press dispatch, 16th)

London, This morning, German planes continued to carry out extensive air raids. British squadrons engaged a German aircraft in aerial combat, and the aircraft dropped several incendiary bombs in a residential area in a town in eastern England. Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, a group of German planes attempted a daytime raid on England, but were intercepted by squadrons of British Spitfires off the coast of Kent, leading to fierce aerial combat. The German planes were driven off. Several incendiary bombs were dropped on Liverpool. A German plane was shot down in eastern England, its fuselage burning for four hours, indicating a large quantity of incendiary bombs. The air raid on London occurred at 9 PM, and German planes were cleared by intense anti-aircraft fire. Air raids were also reported in the Midlands, Northeast, Northwest England, and Eastern Scotland. The Air Force and the Air Defense Command announced that two German planes were destroyed during the air raids, and another was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Two British planes were also lost. (United Press dispatch, 16th)

Berlin, Today, a German military communique stated that last night, elite German air forces attacked military targets in central and southeastern England.

### Development of Soviet Industry and Transport – Continuous Strengthening of National Defense Capabilities

Communist Party Secretary Presents Report to Congress

Moscow, At 6 PM last night, the 18th All-Union Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union opened at the Kremlin. Representatives from party organizations in industrial and transportation centers throughout the country attended, including representatives from the Communist Parties of the new republics (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Karelo-Finnish and Moldavian SSRs). Following the opening, a presidium of 38 members was elected, including Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Andreyev, Zhdanov, Yemelyanov, Khrushchev, Shvernik, and Pospelov. The congress also approved the following agenda: (1) The tasks of party organizations in industry and transportation; (2) Economic achievements in 1940 and future national economic development plans; (3) Organizational issues. Regarding the first item on the agenda, a report was presented by Malenkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. (TASS dispatch, 16th)

Moscow, The 18th All-Union Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union opened last night. Malenkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, presented a report on party organizations in industry and transportation, stating, "Over the past two years, the transportation industry in the Soviet Union has continued to develop. The total value of industrial output in 1938 was 106,834,000,000 rubles, and in 1939 it was 123,915,000,000 rubles. There has also been progress in the transportation sector. In 1940, railway freight increased by 15.1% compared to 1938. Over the past year, Soviet industry and transportation have made significant achievements in implementing the Third Five-Year Plan. Industrial output and freight volume have both increased, guaranteeing further success for the national economy and strengthening national defense capabilities. Due to technological advancements and the development of the defense industry, the Red Army has acquired the most modern weaponry. Over the past two years, the Soviet Union has spent vast sums of money on industry and transportation, establishing many new industries. Investment in industry and transportation in 1938 amounted to only 22,341,000,000 rubles, 25,037,000,000 rubles in 1939, increasing to 27,728,000,000 rubles in 1940.

Our party has implemented Stalin's directives on socialism. Industrialization has become the law of our party's socialist development. Stalin once said that since we do not wish to be vassals of the capitalist economy, we must be fully prepared. Under this guidance, our party has ensured the economic independence of our country. Stalin also said that in order to pursue the interests of socialism, we must develop industry and the economy. Under this directive, we have achieved success exceeding that of capitalism. Currently, the Soviet Union has become a great industrial nation. However, we still have some shortcomings that must be corrected. Previously, we only paid attention to agriculture, but now that the agricultural problem has been solved (grain production reaches 700 to 800 million poods annually), we should shift our attention to the problems of party organizations in industry and transportation. Although we have not abandoned our efforts in agriculture, our party organization is currently extremely solid, and therefore can simultaneously promote agriculture and industry. The tasks that we must complete are: (1) Assisting the People's Commissariat in reviewing the working conditions of factories and implementing the resolutions of the People's Commissariat; (2) Legally registering and organizing all the machinery and raw materials of each factory; (3) Rationally utilizing all machinery, electricity, and raw materials; (4) Maintaining the cleanliness of factories and railways; (5) Implementing production plans in a systematic manner in all factories; (6) Closely monitoring each factory's technical aspects and quality, ensuring that products meet standards; (7) Making technical improvements to legally utilize new machinery; (8) Strengthening worker discipline and consolidating the worker management system. The most important task of the party organization at present is to develop the Stakhanovite movement and cultivate new cadres. In order to strengthen industrial party organizations, municipal district Soviet party committees should appoint secretaries in every industrial institution, and if practically possible, party committees should also appoint secretaries in every transportation institution. At the same time, close attention must be paid to the selection of key industrial cadres.

Regarding technical aspects, we must understand that every Bolshevik party member should become a fighter for new technologies, new outputs, and new methods. We should encourage workers to seek progress in technology. We should provide guidance to workers who lack skills, as it is futile to have good technology without manpower. In addition, we must break with outdated methods, replace them with new ones, and move forward. All of this should be done in accordance with Stalin's directives, mobilizing all workers, engineers, and technicians. Then our party will certainly promote the efficiency of industry and transportation in the shortest possible time.

In short, industry and transportation must make further efforts to increase output and seek progress in quality. Under the wise guidance of our national leader Stalin, our great motherland will certainly achieve new and decisive victories."

After Malenkov's speech, everyone stood up and cheered for Stalin. (TASS dispatch, 16th)

### Australian Troops – Brave and Skilled in Battle

Show Great Skill in North African Campaign – Former Reputation Maintained

London, Military experts are reportedly saying that Australians are "the finest fighting troops on earth." This reputation was earned by the Australians during the previous European war in the battles of France and Gallipoli. Now, Australian troops are again showing great skill in the North African war against Italy, further enhancing their previous reputation. Australians have long legs, and during battle their eyes gleam with ferocity and they sing songs. The tactics they used to capture Bardia and Tobruk, and the songs they sing, have already spread throughout the world. Australians have a reputation for madness in England. The English call Australians mad because there was once a group of Australians walking in Hyde Park who encountered a beautiful nanny pushing a stroller with a sleeping baby inside. The Australian soldiers, upon seeing this, quickly took the baby out of the stroller, placed the nanny inside, and pushed her around, shouting and laughing wildly. As a result, the English feel that there is not much to admire about Australians. The English are quite shocked by the Australians' unconventionality. Australians do not adhere to formalities among themselves. Officers and soldiers address each other by their last names, and only salute when absolutely necessary. The Australian troops are led by very brave and knowledgeable officers. General Mackay is known as "Ivan the Terrible." Mackay became renowned after the Battle of Gallipoli, where he was wounded. He later served in France, where he was awarded a special medal. Before engaging in the desert war, the Australians underwent rigorous training and exercises in the Egyptian desert for a long time. Their training was thorough and focused on war. Before the attack on Bardia, the Australians scouted inside the Italian lines at night, so they were as familiar with the terrain as the defenders. Australia is also known as "the most fearless in the world," and almost everyone is physically strong, perhaps because they are accustomed to outdoor life in their country. Australians are also good at walking and desert travel. As for climbing mountains and crossing ridges in this campaign, Australians find it unremarkable. (United Press dispatch, 16th)

Random Notes on the European War (36)

### Diary of a British Officer on the Western Front

This is the second half of the Western Front diary of British officer Captain Gribble. Due to crowded translation, it has been delayed until now. It is recorded below:

May 22nd: This morning, General George said that the fate of France now rests on the shoulders of the British armored division. The armored division is said to be preparing for action, but there is no news for the time being.

Strangely, the positions overrun by the German mechanized divisions seem empty. Reconnaissance planes repeatedly report on the routes taken by the tanks, "no movement," the fields and cities are desolate. Where are the Germans? Is this offensive a mere threat? Where are the German infantry? Where are the main forces? We guess that the enemy infantry is a hundred miles behind the five thousand tanks. Are we right?

Our army's weakness lies in the lack of unified command and too many governing bodies. Matters that should be handled quickly are kept too secret, losing the element of speed. By the time the coded orders are deciphered, they have lost their timeliness. Another good opportunity was lost today. A column of enemy tanks, lined up in rows of three for twenty miles, was not attacked by our forces because the French could not decide whether the tank column was in the French or British defense zone. The French are most fond of sticking to the rules, and are complete bureaucrats. I think the British also have this weakness. Red tape is more harmful than German tanks on the battlefield.

May 23rd: The headquarters was quiet all night, probably because the transportation routes have been completely destroyed. News arrived this morning that the Germans have occupied Béthune, north of Arras. If the news is true, things are getting very tricky.

The German strategy of cooperation between dive bombers and tanks is invincible. It is said that we are also rapidly forming dive bomber squadrons to deal with them.

General George said that three French mechanized divisions are moving north from the Seine River, from Paris to the coast, to hold the south bank of the Somme River and prevent the enemy's salient from expanding to the sea. The Belgians have also dispatched several divisions to press from the north and northeast of the pocket, hoping to contain the German mechanized forces. Our armored division is preparing to attack the pocket again with air support. Although that is the plan, I think our armored division will have a hard time carrying out the counterattack.

It is said that the French situation is very critical, but the German situation is equally dangerous. The Allied forces could turn defeat into victory with one battle. Everyone in the headquarters agreed with this courageous tone.

4:00 PM: At 12:30, the staff headquarters ordered the cancellation of the air raid on the pocket. Fortunately, the British planes had not yet taken off, but it is unknown whether the French planes were still at the airfield. Around 1:10 PM, the staff headquarters issued another order instructing the air force to bomb Boulogne, Saint-Omer, Béthune, Arras, Cambrai, Saint-Quentin, Amiens, and Abbeville according to the original plan. Enemy tank columns, British ambulance units, French light mechanized divisions, and various troops are engaged in fierce fighting in that area. The scale is unprecedented.

It is reported that the Germans are preparing to launch an offensive from Fromelles, and our bomber squadrons have been ordered to bomb that area.

4:45 PM: An intercepted German radio order instructs "fighters to attack British troop transports at La Lape." La Lape is the airfield in Boulogne. It seems that British troop transports have landed there. It is also rumored that the French are mobilizing a large number of troops in this area to the west to hold the line east of the Philippe Fort, Gravelines, and Saint-Omer, preventing the advance of German mechanized divisions.

It seems that the Allied forces in the north have about twenty-five to thirty divisions. They may move south along the Canal du Nord to cut off the pocket, passing through Bapaume and making contact with the main French forces in Ham.

May 24th: The situation remains uncertain and continues to worsen.

4:00 PM: Colonel Odell attended a staff meeting this morning. When the French First Army retreated, it coordinated its defense with the Seventh Army, and now it will hold the northern positions of the Dunkirk coast.

The French have now concentrated seven divisions between Amiens and Bapaume to counterattack to the north. The northern forces will strike south. If they can make contact, it will not be difficult to turn the tide. Boulogne and Calais have both fallen.

The enemy is concentrating north of Reims. The French counterattack has contained the Germans ten miles northeast of Vaux.

6:45 PM: Reconnaissance planes sent to Soissons, Lille, and Reims have returned safely. The planes were equipped with fighter shields and flew at an altitude of 1,000 feet over the reconnaissance area. The pilots reported that they saw no movement, which is unbelievable. The planes were hit by anti-aircraft fire on the way back, probably mistakenly fired by French forces south of Laon.

8:00 PM: General George had originally planned to attack north in the area around Bapaume and Albert this morning, but cancelled it in the evening. It seems that the British and French may make a deal with Germany, or France may surrender, leaving Britain to fight alone.

May 25th: A French liaison officer came to ask me if there was any fighting north of Abbeville, and whether it was German or British. I know that the tanks moving north from the Somme, besides that one, are all part of the British armored division. I solemnly requested that the French bombers not bomb them by mistake.

I have repeatedly said to myself, "Our staff headquarters should try to simplify everything within its scope." But keeping secrets is often too extreme.

Last night, bomber squadrons flew to the enemy rear areas of Auchy, Guînes, Lumbres, and Wittes to bomb. In fact, our bombers should bomb areas closer to the front lines to harass the already exhausted German troops. We must defeat them there, or the Channel ports may not have any hope of being recaptured.

1:00 PM: The British 51st Division is rushing from Saar to the Somme River. The crossing over the Sensée River north of Cambrai was lost last night. The new plan for today is that the French will recapture the crossing so that both the north and south can carry out their counterattacks yesterday. The Allied forces in the north have about thirty-seven divisions, but the command is not unified, and the morale of each division has been somewhat affected.

It is said that German mechanized forces reached the coast of Dunkirk this morning. If the rumors are true, the British supply lines have been completely cut off. It is said that the British forces in that area are short of food and ammunition, which are now being flown in by planes from Britain.

The situation is chaotic, and things will be clear in a few days. In my personal opinion, the opportunity for a general counterattack has been lost.

On the south bank of the Somme, our armored division doesn't seem to be doing much. If it can't fight the German heavy tank units in the north, why not strike eastward and break the deadlock with a sudden change of direction? There are no German armored divisions blocking the way in the east. Our light tank units could defeat the German infantry and cut off supply lines. As long as they don't encounter heavy tanks, they can be victorious. Moreover, the German heavy tanks are entirely eighty miles to the west. However, everyone has given up this good opportunity. The French insist on pitting the British armored division against the enemy's heavy tanks. The strength disparity is too great, and our light tank units are sacrificing themselves in vain.

May 26th: Not much news during the night. The following conversation, although of little value, can give a glimpse into the morale of our troops. A British staff officer asked a French officer, "When will your counterattack begin?"

The French officer said, "The troops are very tired. It will take some time."

The British officer said, "That's true, but aren't the Germans tired?"

The French officer said, "You must know that the Germans are intoxicated with victory, while our troops are sobered by defeat. A drunk man has the strength of a tiger, and can be worth seven men!"

3:30 PM: Our worst fears were confirmed by the news this afternoon. The Germans have broken through the Belgian lines west of Courtrai and are now attacking Ypres. The British forces in the east have also been forced to retreat south of Saint-Omer, just four miles from Hazebrouck. The French are still holding their positions on the line from Gravelines to Saint-Omer, but the British forces there have retreated to the northeast of the Clairmarais Forest. It is said that the Belgian army has no reserves to reinforce them. The situation is clearly hopeless. The French have a preconceived notion that after the defeat of the French First Army, the British may have considered that the only option besides being captured is to retreat. The French may have heard some rumors about this contingency plan, and believe that they are in an isolated position. The reason for the delay in launching a large-scale counterattack northward from the Somme River may also be due to this suspicion.

May 27th: Reliable news is still very scarce. Responsibility for air command has been taken over by the British. The air force's forward strike squadron now has only fifty-five planes available, and has no opportunity to communicate with the General Headquarters, let alone discuss cooperation plans.

Achitralan came last night from the headquarters of the First Army in Lille. According to him, British losses are not significant, and the Germans have not particularly attacked the British. The Welsh infantry held Arras for four days under German dive bombers, and the losses were not significant either. Later, they got used to the strange sounds and stopped paying attention to them.

French General Billotte died the other day in a car accident, and his position has now been taken over by General Blanchard. The weakness of both of them is that they are too old and conservative. In short, the French are too rigid and cannot compete with the German staff's unpredictability.

### International Situation Changes Rapidly; Speculation Suffers a Fatal Blow; Losses of Ten Million Yuan in One Week; Fantasies of Profiteering Through Hoarding Vanish; Shanghai Municipal Council's Measures to Rectify the Rice Market to Be Implemented Today

Renowned economist Ares, in an article published yesterday in the American publication "Greater America Weekly," commented on the failure of speculative ventures in Shanghai, stating, "A week ago, I wrote an article warning those engaged in speculation in Shanghai, believing that speculative ventures would fail with the deterioration of the international situation. Unfortunately, my prediction has come true. However, while witnessing the realization of my prediction, I feel no schadenfreude. In the past week, Shanghai has suffered losses of at least ten million yuan in foreign exchange, stocks, and commodities. The looming war clouds in the Pacific are an undeniable fact. However, if Shanghai's speculators had acted cautiously in the past few weeks and not built a 'paper house' in the midst of storms, the impact would not have been so severe."

Market Losses of Ten Million Yuan

Long positions in the Shanghai foreign exchange market amount to at least ten million US dollars. In the first ten days of this month, the amount continued to increase. However, since the situation became tense and news of the US freezing foreign exchange came, the market has been in chaos, with a rush to sell US dollars. The price of legal tender (fabi) has been firm. If the Chinese government banks had not bought in large quantities at five and a half yuan, the US dollar would have continued to fall sharply, and the losses of merchants would certainly not have been limited to this. As for the Shanghai stock market, it can be described as a "complete rout." All kinds of stocks fell sharply last week. On Friday afternoon, the average price of common stocks at the close of the market was 274.33 yuan per share, a decline of 20% compared to 336.20 yuan in the third week of January. As for rubber stocks, they fell from the peak of 347.16 yuan in January to 238.77 yuan, a decline of 31%, which is also quite tragic.

Yarn Merchants Lose Fifty Million Yuan

However, the heaviest losses in speculative ventures were borne by commodity speculators. Ten days ago, the best twenty counts of cotton yarn were valued at 1,500 yuan per bale, but now they have fallen to 1,330 yuan. Other cotton yarns have also fallen by 150 to 200 yuan. Shanghai currently has a total of 300,000 bales of cotton yarn, with losses reaching 50 million yuan. The losses in other commodities are not included. After suffering this blow, Shanghai's speculative businesses will be more cautious.

Last Year's Market Situation Serves as a Lesson

The recently published "Millard's Review" also commented on the crisis of Shanghai's future under the hoarding frenzy, offering sharp criticism, stating, "In recent months, Shanghai has been engulfed in a large-scale hoarding spree. Various daily necessities have been targeted by hoarders, resulting in increasingly high prices and a severe shortage of goods. If a market downturn occurs, the consequences will be unimaginable. The crash in May last year serves as a lesson. The most enthusiastic hoarding has been in cotton yarn. Shanghai currently has 300,000 bales of yarn in stock, and sales are extremely difficult, yet prices are only slightly lower than before the major collapse in May last year, and buyers are still eager to buy in."

Hoarding Psychology: Speculating for Profit by Creating Artificial Scarcity

The psychology of hoarders can be summarized into three expectations: (1) The US and Britain may impose a full embargo on Japan, or the US and Britain may formally declare war on Japan. At that time, Shanghai's external supply of goods will be completely cut off. (2) The Chinese currency system may depreciate again, and there is a risk of the US dollar being frozen. It is better to invest in goods, which offer some security. (3) The price of goods is already rising. Once monopolized, it will rise even higher, allowing for sale at the highest possible price in the future to obtain huge profits. In reality, if the first and second expectations do not materialize, then the third will automatically become a bubble. Under this frenzy, hoarders have forgotten last year's collapse and have overlooked the following important points:

Consumer Power Is Far Lower Than Before

(1) The industrial activity and consumption capacity of this city are far lower than before. Taking the most important cotton mills as an example, the current demand for raw materials is less than half of what it was in May last year. The people of Shanghai are becoming increasingly impoverished, and purchasing power has declined to the lowest level. Now, due to hoarding, the price of goods has increased even further, the public's consumption capacity will decline even further, and purchasing power will shrink again. As a result, the hoarders' own goods will face oversupply and less demand. (2) Hoarders dream of the outbreak of war between the US and Japan, sitting back and enjoying unprecedented high prices. This is nothing more than a pipe dream. If there is a war in the Pacific, the entire business of Shanghai will be immediately suffocated. (3) Hoarders have miscalculated the time factor. Now, the more goods are hoarded, and the higher the prices are raised, the longer the expected events fail to materialize. At any time, there is a possibility of triggering a large-scale sell-off, and the situation will spiral out of control. It is not too late to turn back and remedy the situation today, but based on past experience, such earnest warnings are not easily understood until it is too late, which is a pity.

### Rectification of the Rice Market to Begin Today

Yesterday, it was learned that the authorities of the Public Concession, in order to prevent rice prices from rising again, have instructed the Rice Market Management Committee to announce and strictly implement the seven measures to rectify the rice market proposed by the Bureau starting today, and have also dispatched additional detectives to be stationed at the market to monitor business operations. If any transactions are found to be in violation of regulations, they will be arrested and severely punished. It is also learned that the Rice Market Management Committee will also assist in prevention.

Rice Imports from Rangoon and Siam Are Unrestricted

The source of foreign rice is still very abundant. In addition to the 30,000 bags of Hong Kong rice on the Dutch ship "Tjipondoh," which have already been unloaded, the French ship "Los," which arrived in Shanghai from Saigon today, also carried more than 20,000 bags of foreign rice. The amount of Hong Kong rice waiting to be shipped to Shanghai is also huge. Other foreign rice from Siam and Rangoon will also be shipped in large quantities soon. In addition, local merchants have more than one million bags of rice in stock, so there is no fear of a shortage of food for the people. According to reporters, the evolution of the Far East situation is unrelated to the source of foreign rice, as foreign rice from Rangoon and Siam can still be freely transported to Shanghai. Furthermore, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Association will negotiate strictly with the foreign firms in Shanghai, who have purchased foreign rice from various firms but have not delivered the goods as scheduled, which is related to the future of the rice market, in order to ensure that the goods are delivered as agreed.

Profits on Foreign Rice Exceed Legal Limits

In October last year, the authorities of the Public Concession stipulated that rice merchants could obtain a profit of 5% from operating rice. However, the current market price exceeds the legal profit when sold at the purchase price, and speculators still want to raise the price for sale, which is unreasonable. In addition to strictly prohibiting speculative transactions on the current spot market in the rice market, the pricing of purchased foreign rice must also be suppressed. It is found that there are more than a dozen firms in Shanghai that purchase foreign rice, and the fees listed in their purchase prices include insurance, war risk insurance, special military fees, and exchange fees, which increase the purchase price and affect the market price. According to general estimates, the profit per ton of foreign rice can reach about 40 yuan, but people in the industry claim that this is not true.

### Fundraising for Wartime Bonds to Begin Next Month

The Wartime Bond Fundraising Committee, with its headquarters in Chongqing, has established offices throughout the country and in important overseas locations. It will begin a full-scale fundraising drive for wartime bonds starting on March 1st. The fundraising principle will emphasize the absorption of various materials and goods, but will absolutely avoid the various malpractices of past apportionments, and will strive to stimulate the enthusiasm of the people in order to encourage them to voluntarily subscribe. The contributions of overseas Chinese to their motherland and their patriotic enthusiasm are well known throughout the world, so the overseas fundraising work will be implemented in accordance with the established plan. However, given that some countries have various restrictions on fundraising for bonds in their territories, such as the United States, which previously announced an order prohibiting the fundraising of bonds in its territory, the Bond Fundraising Committee has separately requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ambassador Hu to negotiate with the United States to make changes. In addition, in various parts of Southeast Asia, the committee is also making preparations for fundraising for bonds.

### Japanese Troops on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line Forcibly Enlist Laborers; Shops in Haining Close Down

Japanese troops in famous places along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line, such as Haining, Xiashi, and Jiaxing, suddenly began forcibly enlisting laborers starting yesterday (the 16th), forcing them to drive vehicles to other places. In Haining alone, more than 600 people have been conscripted. Local shops have automatically closed down, and residents are staying indoors, so the market is in a state of deathly silence. The whereabouts of the conscripted people are unknown.

### West District Tax Issue: Rumors of Initial Contact; Japanese Propaganda States General Agreement Reached; Formal Negotiations to Begin After Investigation

When Shanghai Municipal Council Chairman and Director-General Fessenden received reporters on the 6th, he made a sincere explanation of the sole purpose of establishing the West District Police Agreement: to restore order in the West District and strive to fulfill obligations for those who live on roads outside the boundary, so that they can enjoy the benefits of the Bureau's services. Therefore, the implementation of the police agreement and whether it can be realized are specified in the annex, which does not allow the existence of improper businesses such as gambling dens and the sale and supply of drugs, which has attracted much attention. Although there is talk of the "Special Police Headquarters" being established on March 1st, "Director-General" Pan Zhijie has already been "appointed," but the "Deputy Director-General" Kirkessa, recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council, has not yet been "approved." The details to be negotiated have not yet been finalized. Yesterday, the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shinbun" stated that as a result of the informal negotiations between the two sides on the tax issue, a "fundamental consensus" has been reached, but because the Shanghai Municipal Council's current tax rate on property taxes collected for roads built outside the boundary is too high, there is still a "disagreement" between the two sides. It is heard that Chen Gongbo's side intends to re-specify a tax rate and have it collected by their side, "to be used to maintain the security of the district" (Chen Gongbo's statement to Japanese reporters the day before yesterday). It is not yet known whether the Shanghai Municipal Council agrees. According to the newspaper, the formal negotiations will begin as soon as the "Finance Bureau" completes its investigation of the collection procedures in the district.

### Labor Strike at Meilian: Mediation Attempted; Negotiations Yesterday Yielded No Results

Datong News Agency reports that the Meilian Industrial Company, formerly known as the Samsung Toothpaste Factory, has its first, second, and third factories on Binlang Road, and its fourth factory was recently expanded last year, located on Xingjiapo Road. The first factory specializes in manufacturing chemicals, the second factory specializes in manufacturing seasonings, the third manufactures mosquito coils, and the fourth manufactures mint essence honey candy. Its issuing office is on Henan Road, namely the China Chemical Industry Society.

The Truth About the Work Stoppage

The first factory previously had about 300 male and female workers, the second factory about 200, the third factory about 100, and the fourth factory only a few dozen. The four factories have a total of more than 600 workers. The cause of the work stoppage was that seven workers were gambling in the factory, and the factory dismissed them for violating factory rules. However, according to the workers, these seven people were representatives who had requested improved treatment last year, which angered the management and led to their dismissal.

Negotiations Ineffective

Since the work stoppage occurred, the workers have been scattered outside the factory, forming a siege. At the same time, eight representatives were sent to see the factory manager, Li Mingyue, yesterday morning. As a result of the negotiations, the two sides were far apart and no results were achieved before dispersing. However, the Political Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council is trying to mediate in order to eliminate the labor strike and may be able to resolve the dispute.

### Hong Kong Immigration Department Establishes Office in Shanghai: 72 Hong Kong Road

Since the Hong Kong authorities began immigration, they have restricted entry. However, since the issuance of this order, merchants and people have found it inconvenient to enter and exit. In order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, the Bureau has established branch offices in major cities to facilitate merchants and people to apply for entry permits nearby. The Shanghai office is now located at 72 Hong Kong Road, telephone number 19010. Anyone who wants to go to Hong Kong to do business or pass through the border can call or go to the above address to contact. The following is a transcript of its announcement: "This office is now entrusted by the Hong Kong Immigration Department to handle entry permit matters. Merchants and people who wish to go to Hong Kong to apply for an entry permit or border transit permit are requested to prepare a guarantor and bring three half-length registration photos (3 inches long and 2 inches wide) to this office to fill out an application form for processing."

### Tjipondoh Has Unloaded Cargo: Will Still Sail South with Passengers; Talvis Cargo Ship Entered Port Yesterday Afternoon

The large mail ship Tjipondoh of the Java Mail Line, after sailing to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 14th, originally intended to leave the port that evening and return to Hong Kong to concentrate and await orders in the Dutch East Indies, according to a telegram from the head office. Later, it received a telegram from Hong Kong approving the unloading of cargo in Shanghai, because the situation in the Far East is not as serious as reported. The ship berthed at the Blue Funnel Wharf yesterday and unloaded cargo as usual.

Maintaining Shipping

According to a "New Voice News Agency" reporter who inquired with the Java Mail Line, the Tjipondoh will continue to sail between the Far East as usual, unless special circumstances occur. Although the Dutch Navy authorities have ordered Dutch ships to prohibit sailing to Shanghai and Japanese ports, the current situation has not yet reached this serious stage. Therefore, after the cargo is unloaded, the ship will still load passengers and cargo in Shanghai and sail along the original route through Hong Kong to various parts of Java. The Jianghai Customs passenger ferry will still carry passengers to the Tjipondoh as usual.

American Ship Arrives in Shanghai

The American cargo ship "Talvis" arrived in port at 2:30 yesterday afternoon, taking the route from the United States via New York, Norfolk, the Panama Canal, Savannah, Manila, and Hong Kong, carrying 2,500 tons of American goods. Unloading began yesterday. In addition, the Gesthwaite of the Fock Yang Company, flying the American flag, will sail directly from Seattle, USA, to Shanghai this morning, carrying a large amount of cargo. The ship will berth at the Gonghexiang Wharf and leave for the United States after staying in Shanghai for two days.

### Duan Dichan Assassinated in Wufoulou Restaurant Yesterday Morning: Bullet Grazes the Back of His Head, No Serious Injury; Duan Has Considerable Influence in the Qing Gang

A shooting occurred in the Wufoulou restaurant on Mintiniyin Road in the French Concession at about 10:15 yesterday morning. The victim was Duan Dichan, who suffered a graze to the back of his head. His injuries are not serious.

Nearly Seventy Years Old, Belongs to the Senior Generation

Duan is 69 years old this year, from Qinghe, and belongs to the senior generation in the Qing Gang, with considerable potential influence. He is currently the executive director of the local Moral Association and resides in the lower room of 28 Zhenhua Lane, Malan Road, in the French Concession. At about 8:00 yesterday morning, he left his residence. At about 10:00, he and his apprentice Feng Yanglin, also known as Feng Sen (43 years old), went together to the Wufoulou restaurant, a Weiyang restaurant at 20 Mintiniyin Road, to eat.

Young Man Opens Fire, Bullet Wounds the Back of the Head

Suddenly, a young man in his twenties wearing a black robe entered through the front door. He glanced at Duan and Feng sitting at round table number 6 and pretended to inspect the area. He walked close to table number 3 and stood there. The waiters thought he was a customer and went to greet him. Unexpectedly, he then pulled out a pistol, quickly walked behind Duan, aimed at the back of his head, and fired. The back of his head was grazed, and blood poured out on the spot, but he was not seriously injured. After firing, the man quickly retreated and fled out of Xinshouan Lane towards the northern section of Avenue Edward VII.

Police Investigation, Five People Have Been Arrested

After the incident, Feng Yanglin went out and called for a French police officer, but the perpetrator had already fled far away. He then accompanied Duan to Guangci Hospital in a Xiangxing taxi for treatment. Fortunately, it was a superficial wound and his life was not in danger. After being bandaged by the doctor, he was discharged from the hospital. In the afternoon, the French police arrested the principal offender and five suspects. It is reported that Duan used to own a bathhouse, and his apprentice Feng Yanglin is an inspector at Pier 3 on the Bund. Wufoulou is a regular haunt he visits every day. This incident may have been caused by a grudge.

### War Against China Cannot Be Ended: Japanese Morale Declines; Indulging in Sensual Pleasures, Life is Depressed; Every Household Lacks Vigor, Atmosphere is Tragic

A Western missionary recently came to Shanghai from Japan and talked about the current living conditions of the Japanese people, saying that from the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident to the fall of Hankou, because the time was still short, Japan seemed to be permeated with a tense atmosphere of war, and the attitude of the people was influenced by the victory or defeat of the war. At this time, the Japanese authorities claimed that the war would be ended within six months, but more than three years have passed, and it continues unabated. The day of ending is far away, so the psychology of the Japanese people has gradually relaxed and become indifferent. Compared with the vigorous morale of the Chinese people, there is a world of difference.

Making War Fortune: Blinded by Greed

The reason why people's hearts are relaxed is that the number of people making war fortunes after the war is extremely large. They are blinded by greed, engage in black market transactions and military industry booms, and are indifferent to national affairs. There are also many people in the laboring class who have obtained rich incomes due to the military industry boom. The expansion and prolongation of the war against China has made Japan's military industry increasingly prosperous. Most primary school teachers responsible for education have also abandoned their sacred duties due to the pressure of life and switched to military industry workers in order to obtain higher salaries. Therefore, the Japanese education sector is currently experiencing a panic due to a lack of primary school teachers.

Indulging in Pleasure: Brothels Flourish

Under these circumstances, it is inevitable that morale will decline. The general wealthy merchants who make war fortunes are full of food and lust, indulging in a life of drunken dreams and sensual pleasures, while the general poor people also use improper entertainment to eliminate depression. Therefore, entertainment venues such as brothels are full every day. According to a survey by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, the total income of geishas is about 500,000 yen per month, and the total number of "customers" averages about 50,000 per month. Although the Japanese authorities have restricted private cars after the war, and the monthly fuel consumption can only travel 150 kilometers, every night in front of high-end brothels, private cars are connected one after another for several miles. This kind of abnormal development is enough to show the depravity of the Japanese people.

Spiritual Mobilization: No Results

The so-called "Spiritual Mobilization Committee" organized after the war not only achieved nothing, but was attacked by the general public. All knowledge stages made pertinent criticisms, saying that during the Russo-Japanese War, there was no organization for spiritual mobilization in the country, and the country, from top to bottom, was united and went to the national disaster together. Now that there is a Spiritual Mobilization Committee, it does nothing except for regular meetings, and there are actually no results. This is not the fault of the committee, but because the people do not cooperate. The Japanese believe that this war is only a matter for a few military閥 and has nothing to do with the entire nation.

Currency Inflation: High Prices

Corresponding to the fact that the spirit is depressed is the inferiority of extravagance. Although prices are constantly rising due to the impact of currency inflation, the business of major department stores is booming, and people are not stingy. They buy non-essential goods that are four or five times more expensive than before the war. Although the authorities have repeatedly issued prohibition orders, the enthusiasm of the people to buy luxury goods has become more and more intense. Because stores are eager to clear their inventories, and people are also eager to pre-purchase goods. The so-called prohibition of extravagance has turned into encouraging extravagance. The authorities' various measures are intended to make the people care about the war, and their intentions are good, but the people are still indulging in a dissolute life. What can be done?

Widespread Harvest Failures: Food Panic

Although the enjoyment and extravagance of the Japanese people have reached this point, food panic is also obvious. Taking rice as an example, Japan produces more than 70 million shi of rice every year, plus white rice imported from Korea and Taiwan, which can maintain the national food supply. However, due to consecutive years of drought in the country, harvests have been poor everywhere, so the authorities have tried to import large quantities of "foreign rice" to meet urgent needs. The shortage of rice sources in Shanghai and the high price of rice may also be related to this. If Japan's supply of "foreign rice" is cut off, the food panic can be imagined. In order to remedy this situation, the Japanese are now reducing consumption during the spring rice season, so most people eat yellow糙米. The authorities also advocate using sweet potatoes and noodles instead of rice to alleviate the food panic.

Every Household: Tragic Atmosphere

In addition, although charcoal is sold at limited prices by the authorities due to hoarding by charcoal merchants, prices are still soaring. As for sugar, there is no supply on the market. Although the authorities have implemented a ticket system, each household is only allowed to purchase the quantity specified on the ticket, but due to a lack of inventory, even with a ticket, it is not easy to purchase. As for food, cotton products are no longer seen, and only "man-made 維" woven materials are used instead. The most important thing is the lack of able-bodied men. It is difficult to see able-bodied men on the streets. All the work of able-bodied men is replaced by women and teenagers. Even in the military industry workers, women and children account for the most. These able-bodied men are all sent to China to sacrifice their lives. The enlistment plaques and the memorial plaques for those who died in battle hung at the door of every household symbolize the tragic future of Japan.

### British Victories on All Front Lines Excite Foreigners

The British have risen up to fight and resist the advance of the invaders. Recently, they have achieved continuous victories in the Middle East and Africa. The British, Dutch, and Norwegian expatriates in Shanghai are becoming more and more enthusiastic. They express their deep respect for the brave soldiers who have contributed their efforts, and have raised huge sums of money to transport to the front lines to慰勉 the soldiers. In addition to the 30,000 yuan donated by the Norwegian Consulate, which has been remitted to London, the number of donations concentrated by the British War Relief Association has increased even further last week. The amount raised was 10,900 yuan in national currency and 102 British pounds. Together with the amount raised in the previous week, the total is 1,736,629.89 yuan and 23,599 pounds, 18 shillings and 2 pence.

### Fang Dan Case to Resume Hearing Tomorrow

The "Fang Dan Tax Case" in which Chinese landlords Fang Jiaping, Hu Jingfang, Zhu Ruiqing, and Fang Wende are suing the Shanghai Municipal Council, after a hearing in the Consular Court, has been postponed for two weeks at the request of the defendant's lawyer. It is now scheduled to be heard in the Consular Court at 2:30 pm on the 18th. At that time, the Shanghai Municipal Council will still be defended by lawyer Bolian.

### Calling for Assistance to the New Pu Yu Tang (Continued): An Urgent Need for Rescue

The New Pu Yu Tang is located at South Guolu, Lujia Hong, Dainanmen, Nanshi. It was founded by Mr. Lu Bohong. For thirty years, it has been housing the elderly, weak, disabled, orphans, and widows. It requires an annual budget of 200,000 yuan. Because it has no fixed foundation, it has relied on the annual financial assistance of local public organizations, charitable institutions, temple directorates, and donations from private individuals. It has managed to maintain operations until now. One can imagine the difficulty of its development and the enthusiasm and perseverance of those in charge.

General Achievements

As of this year, it has housed a total of over 100,550 poor men and women. On average, over 3,500 people are cared for in the home daily. The total number of medical consultations and medicines provided over the years has reached over 2.44 million. Since the death of Mr. Lu Bohong, funding has been extremely difficult. In desperation, the number of people accepted has been reduced repeatedly, but there are still thousands who cannot be dismissed. Currently, the institution houses and educates over 400 orphans, over 200 elderly and weak individuals, and over 100 disabled men and women. In addition to daily medical consultations and medicine, a large number of impoverished patients are admitted to the free wards. Under the leadership of over ten Sisters of Charity of the Catholic Church, the orphans in the institution live an orderly life, receiving both education and care, no different from one's own children. This group of children urgently needs society to nurture them. Although those in charge do not shirk their hard work, they are on the verge of collapse due to lack of funds. They are eagerly awaiting the rescue of society.

Difficult Circumstances

The largest expense of the institution is food. When the Nanshi refugee area, run by Father Jacquinot, was in existence, it was fortunate to receive a monthly allocation for rice. In addition, some outside donations and the labor of those housed in the institution allowed it to barely manage. However, with the end of the Nanshi refugee area, this supply of rice was also cut off. At a time when rice costs 100 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), providing food and shelter for nearly a thousand elderly, weak, and orphaned children, coupled with daily expenses, requires at least 16,000 yuan per month. Currently, the monthly donations and work income total only 5,000 or 6,000 yuan, which is far from sufficient.

Needed Funds and Supplies

In order to continue to maintain the lives of nearly a thousand elderly, weak, and orphaned children, we respectfully ask all benevolent readers to contribute generously, whether in funds or supplies, all are needed, and the recipients will be extremely grateful. The institution urgently needs the following items: coal, rice, oil, cotton, kerosene, cloth, medicines, salt, flour, and various daily necessities and funds.

From the above situation, everyone can imagine the hardships endured by the hall in its twenty years of operation. Among those who have received education and care, there are over ten thousand who are now serving in society. The achievements they have made should be estimated by people in society, because this is the most accurate estimate, and this is the most accurate value. As for donations from readers, please send them to the following locations: (A) For receiving donations in kind: Catholic Church, Rue Pierre Henry, French Concession. (B) For receiving donations in cash: (1) Silk Industry Bank Trust Department, Hankou Road, No. 60; (2) Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, The Bund Sassoon House; (3) Ji Hua Tang, Yunnan Road, No. 47; (4) Hua Mei Pharmacy, Fuzhou Road, No. 156; (5) Catholic Church, Rue Yang King Pang, French Concession. These locations will issue public announcements upon receiving money or goods to show good faith. (The End)

### Nightclub Attack: Two Men and Women Killed; More Than a Dozen Thugs Arrived and Departed in Cars; Western Men and Women Were Shot and Intimidated

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, at approximately 12:15 AM last night (the 15th), while the Fa Lun Nightclub on Avenue Haig was in full swing, with customers crowded in the downstairs dance floor and the upstairs gambling area, suddenly more than a dozen thugs, believed to be Koreans, Taiwanese, and Chinese, each holding a Mauser pistol in their right hand and a hand grenade in their left,

Swarmed in,

First firing several shots into the ceiling of the dance floor. A portion of the thugs went directly to the roulette room on the second floor and fired many shots into the ceiling without explanation, immediately causing chaos. The gambling hall's bodyguard, Lun Su (34 years old, an Austrian refugee), returned fire at one of the thugs and was then bombarded by the remaining thugs. An English woman, Simon, (28 years old, residing at 1326 Avenue Joffre), was hit by a stray bullet,

Seriously injured.

Lun Su was also hit in the head by a bullet and collapsed. The thugs then roared and rushed out, boarding four unmarked new-style cars and fleeing. When the police arrived after hearing the news, they guarded all the entrances of the nightclub and set up a perimeter around the area, but the thugs had already escaped. Simon and Lun Su, who were injured, were sent to the hospital, but before they could be saved,

Both died.

The police believe that the fact that the thugs escaped in cars is very significant and suspect that they were sent by a rival gambling hall. Their motive was nothing more than intimidation. The Fa Lun Nightclub, having suffered this unexpected disaster, will be closed tonight (the 16th) and will reopen on Monday.

### Robbers Resist Arrest: Stray Bullets Injure Pedestrians

Stolen Goods Abandoned and Returned to Owner; One Robber Arrested, the Rest Fled

At approximately 6:50 AM yesterday morning, three robbers, one of whom was holding a pistol, broke into the home of Shen Agui, a local resident living at No. 10, Lane 1674, Jiaozhou Road, Xin Zha Road, Public Concession. They used threats and intimidation and ultimately only stole a gold ring, a coat, and a little more than ten yuan in national currency before fleeing. Detectives No. 674 and No. 743 gave chase.

At least three goals were lost yesterday due to Qin's carelessness. Dai and Li were also unable to work in coordination. Jia Youliang performed well. Reviewing the Portuguese team, Oliveira was added to the midfield, and Fasigesuo and Fafanxiao were added to the front. With these three new players, the whole team became even better. It was known before the game that defeat was inevitable, but not such a crushing defeat.

90 Minutes of Humiliating Defeat

Five minutes after the start of the game, Gaisi opened the scoring. Kaoshi Qin kicked a free kick. Gain caught it and scored. Ten minutes later, Baladas broke in from the side. Su Ruo responded beside him. Su Ruo crossed the ball, and Kelasha scored the second goal. Several minutes before the end of the first half, Fafanxiao scored another goal with his head, making it 3-0.

Kaoshi Tai's free kick also hit the target, making it half a dozen. At this time, Jia Youliang finally scored a goal, triggering a great cheer. Su Ruo, Gain, and Kelasha launched another attack, as if entering an empty field, each scoring one goal, for a total of 9-1.

Linesman Suffers Unwarranted Disaster

About twenty minutes after the second half continued, when the score was already 4-0, spectators in the south grandstand threw stones at the field because linesman Ma Qidi was derelict in his duties. He was hit in the head and immediately started bleeding. Referee Kana then appointed another person to replace him. It was also a minor disturbance.

### Japan's "Yen Bloc Trading System" by Gu Liaoqi

The Sentiment of Laughter and Tears

From the start of the Sino-Japanese War to the present, Japan has a trade surplus of approximately 3 billion yen with China (including the Northeast). Although European and American markets in China have been almost entirely deprived, and the vast market of over 400 million people is controlled by Japan, in theory, Japan's long-cherished wish has been fulfilled, and they should be beaming with joy. However, Japan's "patriots" are instead frowning, believing it to be an "unbearable burden." How can they have such a paradoxical sentiment? It is because what it brings to Japan is not benefit, but a greater crisis.

Under the wartime system, Japan's export trade is aimed at obtaining imports of war materials. After the August 13th Incident, Japanese goods faced obstacles everywhere overseas. It was only by blockading the markets in the occupied areas of China that they maintained a way out. The Chinese consumer market needs light industrial products. The faster the development of exports to China, the stronger the opposition from Japanese capitalists to the military's so-called key industries plan. The military wants to concentrate all the limited domestic productivity on heavy industry, but the capitalists reply: If we don't cater to the needs of overseas markets, where will we get the materials for military needs? Similarly, the military initially planned to fully "Japanize" China, allowing them to issue unlimited unconvertible paper money to plunder Chinese native products and implement "using war to sustain war." But Japanese capitalists pointed out that this would block the last way to obtain export foreign exchange, which is also the only possible suicide to obtain imports of military supplies.

Although China has a complex and vast raw material supply market, Japan's most feared strategic resources, such as mineral sands, oil, rubber, machinery, and tools, still depend on Southeast Asia and the Americas! Although the slogan of development is shouted loudly, the financial magnates are indeed eager to try. However, under the guerrilla warfare in China, the Japanese financial magnates had to ask the military to "ensure security." With the depletion of its troops, the Japanese military could not really help and could not stand up with pride. Therefore, the Japanese financial magnates had to stay in places like Shanghai and Tianjin, engaging in monopoly and manipulation.

Initially, the Japanese military still had some comfort, because they could use the acquired Chinese native products to exchange for military raw materials from third countries. However, now the export of military materials from various countries is based on political interests, and everyone refuses to trade with Japan, the public enemy of democracy. The American moral embargo has long caused Japan a great headache. Moreover, the current international situation is further approaching the final moment. Japan's replenishment of rice is not enough, and preparation is out of the question.

Now, although Japanese financial magnates and soldiers are still waving the banner of "using war to sustain war" and monopolizing the resources and markets in the occupied areas of China, in fact, they are only expanding the private pockets of the financial magnates and soldiers. The so-called "military needs profits" have become a mask of some degree. Because of this, the financial magnates are fighting over the spoils. The so-called "establishment of an adjustment mechanism for the yen bloc trade" has led to the emergence of various "trade associations," merely to ease the mutual competition and conflicts of interest. It does not contribute much to his so-called "wartime economic system."

### Three Changes in Policy

If we open up the process of Japan's control of trade in the occupied areas, the above-mentioned feeling of laughter and tears will be fully expressed.

From the start of the war to the present, Japan's trade policy can be roughly divided into three periods.

The first period unfolded under the promulgation of the "Temporary Import and Export Permit Regulations." At that time, on the one hand, it prevented the export of raw materials related to domestic military needs, and on the other hand, it restricted the export of raw materials for domestic consumer goods industries. At the same time, it implemented "control and restriction of manufacturing, sales, distribution, etc." to control the situation of domestic material production and sales. From the perspective of wartime economy, this is indeed a orthodox policy. However, the financial magnates clamored for insufficient raw materials, shouted "material readjustment," and the people were hungry, starting speculation in the black market. The economic police organization was successful, but they could not serve the public wholeheartedly: therefore, they intentionally or unintentionally sympathized with those who violated the controls. The Japanese government had to make changes.

The second period began, which was the "trade interlocking system" invented by the military's economic advisors. Initially, each merchant's imports should be equal to its export value. Afterwards, the import of certain commodities required the export of an equivalent amount of a certain commodity. However, the only effect of this policy was to crack down on a batch of non-industry people engaged in import and export speculation. The adjustment of domestic material supply and demand relations only made it rigid and did not help to enrich and smooth it. On the contrary, because a certain amount of export could obtain a certain amount of import, the big capitalists restored their advantages in free competition, forcing the general small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises to be tied up and cry bitterly.

The appeals of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises can indeed be ignored. However, the hurricane of overseas market resistance forced the Japanese government to make other plans. Moreover, the sharp increase in exports to China at that time had extremely deteriorated the competition among Japanese merchants and affected the overseas market of the Japanese yen. Thus,

The third period began, starting to thoroughly close the door to the Chinese market, both to vent anger on Britain and the United States, and to open up a last resort. From March 20, 1939, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry promulgated the "Conditions for Export Adjustment to Kwantung Prefecture, Manchuria, and the Republic of China." It stipulated that exports to China must be approved by government agencies. However, the right to apply to government agencies for exports to China was limited to groups designated by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Needless to say, these groups would be led by financial magnates and big entrepreneurs. The financial magnates were satisfied, believing that "planned trade has been established!"

### "Trade Associations" within China

Trade associations centered on financial magnates were subsequently organized in the occupied areas of China. The purpose was to ease the friction and competition among Japanese merchants. As a result, the advantages of the financial magnates were further guaranteed. Look, in those "Central China Japanese Import Distribution Associations," most were headed by Mitsui.

"Central China Japanese Import Distribution Association"

In addition, there are import and distribution associations of merchants from Taiwan, Korea, and even the Northeast, and together with the 25 associations mentioned above, they formed a "Central China Import Distribution Association Federation" as the vanguard of the "Japan East Asia Import and Export Association Federation" in Japan. The head of this federation is Hanawa Yuro, the head of Mitsui & Co. in Shanghai.

In addition to these "ordinary" trade associations, there are two special associations. One is called the "Central China Military Ticket Exchange Goods Distribution Association," which is the designated agency for promoting the circulation of Japanese military tickets. Because military tickets cannot be remitted to Japan as deposits, Japanese exporters to China regard obtaining Chinese legal currency as the first priority. In order to advertise military tickets, the Japanese military designated a number of Japanese merchants who made the most profit in China to form this association. In name, these associations have the obligation to fully accept military tickets as the price of goods sold. But in fact, they are the special forces for collecting Chinese native products with military tickets. This association is located upstairs in the Yokohama Specie Bank on the Bund, divided into eight departments, all of which are the world of Mitsui and Mitsubishi.

"Central China Military Ticket Exchange Goods Distribution Association"

Cotton Department: Director Toyo Cotton

Rayon Department: Director Japan Cotton

Wool Department: Director Abeichi Yoko

Sugar Department: Director Zokou Yoko, Deputy Mitsubishi Shoji, Director Fukuwayu Yoko, Supervisor Mitsui Bussan

Paper Department: Director Mitsui Bussan, Deputy Daito Yopaper Store, Director Niwa Shokai, Supervisor Bunjin Yoko

Grain Fertilizer Department: Director Mitsui Bussan, Deputy Mitsubishi Shoji, Director Japan Cotton, Yinghua Yoko, Yoshida, Yokoyama Yoko, Supervisor Itochu Shoji,

Dye Department: Director Mitsubishi Shoji, Deputy Showa Dye, Director Mitsui Bussan, Osaka Godo, Miki Shoten, Supervisor Saihua Yoko,

Industrial Chemicals: Director Mitsui Bussan, Deputy Mitsubishi Shoji, Director Yoshiyu, Itochu Shoji, Ataka Shokai, Miki Shoten, Sakai Shoji, Supervisor Kobayashi Yoko,

Another special organization is called the "Material Circulation Association." It includes controlling the commodity sales market in Central China and handling the collection of various military materials and raw materials in the occupied areas of Central China. According to the types of commodities it operates, the following specialized agencies are active.

"Material Circulation Association" in Central China

The mission of this type of organization is to plunder the material supply market in the occupied areas in order to carry out its so-called "using war to sustain war" plan. And in order to emphasize its satisfaction with this desire, from June of last year, it tightened the blockade of the Shanghai Concession and the inland. This blockade is divided into two parts. The first part is to prohibit the transportation of goods from the Shanghai Concession to the occupied areas. The purpose of this is only to protect the monopoly interests of the various associations mentioned above, and at the same time to exclude the sale of non-Japanese goods in the Chinese occupied area market. The other part is to prohibit the transportation of goods from the occupied areas to the Shanghai Concession and the inland, and the purpose is its full-scale "using war to sustain war" policy.

According to the items prohibited by the Central China Japanese Military on June 10 last year from entering the Concession and the inland: gold, rice, wheat, oil, cotton, raw silk and silk scraps, hemp, leather, eggs and egg products, pig bristles, bird feathers, pig intestines, tung oil, tea, tobacco, ore, empty cans, bricks, automobile parts, rubber shoes, tires, radio batteries, telegraph machinery materials, telephone machinery materials, handkerchiefs, batteries, wood, cement, petroleum, gasoline, boats, etc.

As for the goods prohibited from being transported from the Shanghai Concession (including the occupied parts of the non-Concession) to the occupied areas, according to the same regulations, there are 25 types. Namely, eggs and their products, pig bristles, bird feathers, pig intestines, tung oil, tea, ore, raw silk and silk scraps, leather, cotton, metal, stone, machinery, petroleum and other oils, wood, edible oil, cotton yarn, wool yarn, woolen fabrics, rayon fabrics, sugar, soap, matches, salt, tobacco, but with the "permission" of the Japanese military can be transported in.

These two opposite blockades are exercised simultaneously on the same kind of goods, such as not allowing eggs from the occupied areas to be transported and sold in Shanghai, and not allowing eggs from Shanghai to be freely sold to the occupied areas. This seems to be an incredible atrocity. However, in Japan, it has already taken a lot of effort. In a word: "Everyone is not allowed to buy and sell! If you want to buy and sell, you must first go through my hands." When it reaches his hands, he will leave or transport what he wants to the islands. If he doesn't want it, he must pay a tax, or force you to sell it cheaply to their association, so that their association can sell it and make money. This is the only way Japan controls the material market in the occupied areas of China, and this is why. Whether it is in the Northeast, North China, or South China, it is done in the same way. For example, in Tianjin, there are also the following "import distribution associations."

### A Few Words on Controlled Economy by Yan Maode

The fundamental goal of a controlled economy is to improve the standard of living, that is, to systematically organize and manage the various sectors of the economy, such as consumption, production, trade, and distribution, in order to achieve the policies of the controlled economy and improve the standard of living. From a technical perspective, its goals can be divided into: (1) Eliminating economic inequality. Under the capitalist system, based on free competition, perhaps this plan is an indispensable system for human material civilization. However, this system will immediately produce a serious incidental phenomenon in application, the so-called unequal distribution of wealth and property income. This, of course, requires the power of the state to remedy the natural economic decline of industries. The formation of industrial decline has (A) due to the economic cycle, (B) due to non-economic cycles. To control the economy, we only need to improve non-economic factors and limit the expansion of the machine range. Unbalanced prices of financial institutions, such as retail prices being too high, affect people's lives. To make wholesale prices affect retail prices, it must be controlled. As for financial trade, sometimes the power of trade cannot affect the financial market, so it should be limited. (3) Unemployment relief. Since the progress of modern machines, productivity has greatly increased, but labor has not decreased, resulting in a large number of unemployed people. However, products must be backed by needs, and there are two types: (A) market needs, (B) empty needs. Market needs are economic needs, while empty needs are without purchasing power. If empty needs are substituted for market needs, there will be a surplus of products, factories will close, and workers will be unemployed. Therefore, production must be balanced with market needs. If needs exceed future production capacity, it must be prevented. (4) Reform of morbid industries. The so-called morbid industry is where production costs and needs cannot be balanced. This kind of industry disease is a waste of capital, so it must be limited. (5) Maximize the effectiveness of capital. The controlled economy is based on the nation and the nation. It is formed due to the collapse of the international economic system and the economic reaction. Under the international economic system, the flow of capital is moved by interest rates. To make the flow of funds move on a rational path instead of being moved by interest rates, it is bound to control the economy. However, under the free economic system, funds are inevitably attracted by high interest rates and used for speculation and high interest rates, such as the frantic speculation in London from 1919 to 1926. In order to avoid this kind of funds being used for speculative ventures, the country should support small industrial and commercial enterprises of the people, such as opening banks to support them with loans. (6) Use the controlled economy as a tool for aggression. Use the natural resources of the invaded country and use your own capital and labor to engage in development and utilization, with the excuse of solving the population problem. Therefore, modern countries that violate international peace use this economic control policy as their means.

### Fluctuations in Yarn and Flower Yarn Prices are Like a Swift Wind and Torrential Rain; Speculators Suffer Great Losses

The price of Double Horse yarn was 1,418 yuan at the end of last year. During the winter vacation, the market had already risen to 1,428 yuan. This spring, the market has been rising every day, reaching a peak price of 1,530 yuan on February 4. Compared with the sudden drop to 800 yuan in the May 1st disturbance last year, the increase reached nearly 50%. Recently, due to the increasingly tense Far East situation, the exchange rate has risen sharply, and gold has plummeted. In these eleven days, it has been falling miserably step by step. The difference between the high price on the 4th and the lowest peak on the 15th is 315 yuan. The change is shocking. It falls about 100 yuan in two days. There are several reasons for this:

(1) In mid-November last year, the general observation of the yarn market was that sales in the southwest were not smooth, and the crackdown on hoarding in Sichuan was strict. The market price was slightly easy to rise, and most were short sellers. The price of Double Horse yarn fluctuated between 1,200 yuan and 160 yuan.

(2) Unexpectedly, foreign customers came to do more, and specialized in collecting Double Horse yarn. Generally, those without knowledge thought that a certain bank was opening and the exchange rate would shrink and gold would rise sharply. Therefore, a buying frenzy was set off. As a result, both domestic and foreign companies were dragged into the long line. The Double Horse yarn orders, the possible range, was only tens of thousands of packages. The sudden rush to buy was not enough to allocate the chips, so it rose with the trend. As for the general small banks and companies on the island, there were as many as hairs. You come in and I drag, the higher the price, the more we enter, creating a one-sided buying side.

(3) The yarn purchased by the Hong Kong gang was landed at Sha Yu Chong and transferred to the mainland. Now there are obstacles and purchases have stopped. After the red market, the yarn number opened about 230,000 packages of Double Globe Jincheng Tiannv 13-count Golden Chicken Dafa to the factories in March. Although this is speculation, it is backed by actual sales. Unexpectedly, the transportation is blocked. The general holders of goods are worried that the deadline is approaching and the way out is not open. They must pay the silver to deliver the goods when the deadline is due. Moreover, the price of Double Horse yarn is still more than 1350 yuan higher than the price of miscellaneous brands. They are vying to cash out to the Double Horse market to temporarily avoid danger. Therefore, the biggest factor in the violent Double Horse decline in the past two days is also.

(4) Generally, we boast to customers, nothing but good. Therefore, there are more real ones and fewer false ones. In addition, the relationship of chips, and the price of yarn rises. The customers are not without the belief that what the number said is correct. And the reaction suddenly arises, and the decline is rapid. The general bulls are caught off guard again. As for the small company, each 10 pieces of the customer will receive a deposit of 1,000 to 1,500 yuan. In these 11 days, they have been miserable. Many friends who are unable to increase the payment of the money have to endure the pain and cut the knot. Therefore, the market is showing a panic. The market has become a thousand miles away, and it has become an irreparable situation. In the end, the speculative friends who are not wealthy have suffered, and they often end up losing their capital.

### North-South Goods; Persimmon Cakes Rise Six Yuan

There are not many sources of persimmon cakes, and the market continues to be tight. Gaocun boxed row cakes are opened at 50 boxes, 50 yuan, and then increased by 6 yuan. Another 600 boxes of the next village, 42 yuan, are passed by various countries as if counted, and the market is very good.

### Sugar Market; Sugar Prices Loosen

Yesterday, the sugar market was weak due to the Sunday holiday. The guild allocated the market. The spot price of 24 coarse white sugar was 83 yuan to 83 yuan 3 jiao for foreign warehouses, and then to 2 jiao. The plan was a small 4 jiao. The futures for the 25th of this month and the 10th of next month are 83 yuan. Taikoo car white B mark East warehouse is 83 yuan 1 jiao, West warehouse is 83 yuan, HX mark is 8 yuan 1 jiao.

### Miscellaneous; Soap Continues to Rise

The selling price of soap has been tight for several days. The sales volume is very different from the cost of raw materials from the factory, and only a few colleagues have been dispatched to sell it. The stock is not enough for market sales, resulting in high prices and good sales. Currently, the solid original soap has been sold for 28 yuan 8 jiao per box, Baixiang Mao soap has been sold for 25 yuan per box, Huangxiang Mao soap has been sold for 20 yuan 8 jiao per box, and the new market price of Scissors soap is 24 yuan per box.

### Nominal Wages and Real Wages by Munar

Reports from the Bureau of Public Works' "Shanghai Living Statistics" include a statement saying: "The real wage index has fallen to a low of 55.33." What is a real wage? To solve this question, nominal wages must be discussed at the same time.

Wages can generally be divided into two categories: wages in kind and monetary wages. The rice stipends of officials in the late Qing Dynasty are good examples of wages in kind. On the other hand, the one yuan paid to a modern worker for a day's work, or the five jiao paid for each item manufactured, are examples of monetary wages. Under a monetary wage system, because the purchasing power of money is not fixed, there arises a distinction between nominal wage and real wage. What is a nominal wage? A nominal wage is "the actual amount of money in wages." For example, if someone's monthly salary is one hundred yuan, then one hundred yuan is that person's nominal wage. What is a real wage? A real wage is "the sum total of the purchasing power of nominal wages." For example, if rice was ten yuan per shi before the war and one hundred yuan per shi after the war, then someone with a monthly salary of one hundred yuan would have a real daily wage equivalent to ten shi of rice before the war, and a real wage equivalent to one shi of rice after the war. Because the purchasing power of money varies with time, nominal wages and real wages cannot move in step at different times. To illustrate, let's assume that someone's economic situation before and after the war is shown in the following table:

Although someone's salary in 1940 has increased by 1.75 times compared to 1936, prices have soared in these years, and the cost of living index has increased from 100% in 1936 to 500%. This means that the purchasing power of each yuan of legal tender in 1940 is only equivalent to two mao of silver dollars in 1936. Therefore, although someone's nominal wage has increased from one hundred yuan to two hundred and seventy-five yuan, the goods that these two hundred and seventy-five yuan can buy are only equivalent to the goods that fifty-five yuan could buy in 1936. That is to say, someone's real wage has fallen from 100% in 1936 to 55%. From the above example, we can know that there are two factors that determine the real wage, namely the current purchasing power index of money and the current nominal wage. Therefore, the calculation method of real wage should be as follows: Real Wage with a certain year as a reference = Current Nominal Wage × Purchasing power of this year's money with a certain year as a reference.

Therefore, the real wage of a certain person in 1940 based on the currency of the people's republic is as follows: After the war, although the nominal wages of general workers have increased, the two factors of price are too large. The real wage is in the process of falling, no wonder the lives of general workers in recent times, not only do not see any improvement, but become more and more difficult!

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### The Safety Issues of Clothing, Food, Housing and Transportation
— Yingdai

In the past, the concession held safety campaigns for transportation, and indeed, safety is what everyone expects. But usually, we often neglect safety issues, which can lead to illness, and even death. Here, the safety issues of clothing, food, housing, and transportation are written below to promote the attention of the general public.

Clothing: The clothes we wear should be kept clean and washed often. The size should fit the body, neither too big nor too small. Women's small vests and excessively tight shirts are harmful to the body and should be discarded. Workers who are close to machines should wear smaller clothes, avoid long and large clothes, and it is best to wear short clothes. Change clothes frequently when the weather is uncertain to avoid catching a cold.

Food: Do not eat snacks in addition to three meals. As the saying goes, "disease enters through the mouth," which is indeed correct. The dishes you eat every day do not matter whether they are good or clean. Especially in the summer, everything must be thoroughly cooked and not licked by flies. Cold drinks should not be eaten too much, and overnight food and open-air food cannot be eaten.

Housing: The most important issue with housing is fire prevention, so one-story houses and three-story houses are still not good. Do not live too crowded. Prepare fire extinguishing chemicals in each room. In case of a fire, how to put it out and how to escape must be decided in advance so as not to be chaotic at the time. The head of the family should inspect the entire house once every night before going to bed to prevent fire hazards. Other safety measures such as opening windows, widening the handrails, and frequent cleaning are also enough to improve safety.

Transportation: If people living in cities have nothing to do, it is best not to go out. The so-called road is like a tiger's mouth. If you go out, you are always in danger of being run over by a car. Traffic rules should be strictly followed. If walking, there should be a limit in hot weather, and do not walk too much to prevent fainting. Always pay attention when getting on and off the car to prevent danger. In this way, walking may be safer.

### Novel Clothing Materials
— Hongmian

The clothing materials commonly used by humans are nothing more than silk, wool, cotton, and linen. The first two are derived from animals, and the latter two are derived from plants, all of which are prepared for us by the Creator. However, the things that can be used to obtain fiber are not limited to these few natural types. Because of the progress of scientific civilization, in addition to rayon that has been popular all over the world, recently some people have made fiber and fabrics from milk; at the same time, they have used fish, trees, coal, gravel, and the like to manufacture fibers and weave cloth, and some people are working hard to study it.

Weaving clothes with milk is Italy's latest invention. These chemical products are very similar to natural wool after they are made, and their properties are not much different. It is said that sixty-three pints of milk can make an undershirt and an overcoat. Factories in Milan, Italy, are trying to develop this new invention. In the United States, chemists at the Department of Agriculture, as well as laboratories of several manufacturers, have long begun research and are gradually approaching success.

The process of making milk into fiber is to first extract cheese fat from milk and use it to make butter. Then, the refined milk is treated with acids to coagulate the casein in the milk into a curd-like substance. Then, the water in the milk is removed, and the acidity is neutralized to form lumps. Next, the curd-like casein is dried into casein powder, which is then dissolved in chemicals to make a viscous liquid. The viscous liquid is then ejected from small holes called "spinning holes" and introduced into a chemical "bath" of formaldehyde solution, where it hardens into fibers. Then, it is introduced into another tank containing medicinal liquid to dry the fibers, becoming a wool-like substance, and then the manufacturing process is completed. The man-made wool produced can be spun into yarn, then woven into cloth, and then cut into various styles of clothing. Therefore, this new clothing material is actually made by chemically treating the casein protein in milk.

The fiber of this man-made wool is solid and can be made into any shape, with a specified thickness, and can be extended to any length. The ratio of each chemical component in it is almost the same as that of natural wool, so it has a very high practical value. As for the manufacturing cost, it is also extremely low. If there is machinery and equipment for manufacturing rayon, it can be used with slight modifications. Therefore, the future of this new industry is very promising.

However, the raw material for man-made wool fiber is milk, a type of bacteria that can easily invade milk and cause it to become sour, can still produce an enzyme that destroys the manufactured fiber, and casein-made clothing is still lacking. However, this difficulty is not insurmountable. I believe that it can be solved satisfactorily after another study by scientists.

In addition to man-made wool fiber, there is also a glass fiber, which is made by passing molten glass liquid through small holes. Its diameter is smaller than that of a hair, and it can be spun into yarn and then woven into clothing or furniture cloth. Similar to glass fiber, there is another type of metal fiber, which can be used to make fabrics by extending the metal to extremely thin fiber bodies.

The above only describes a few novel clothing materials that have been quite successful. Now, European and American countries are making efforts to manufacture artificial fibers. The range of raw materials will of course be wider in the future.

### Steamed Buns
— Zhang Huiyu

Steamed buns are a common snack in the state and can be said to have been eaten by everyone, regardless of rich or poor, but the materials are different. But since we eat steamed buns, we must also know the anecdotes and common sense of steamed buns.

Steamed buns are originally a corruption of barbarian heads, and most people only know steamed buns and do not know barbarian heads.

During the Three Kingdoms period, the southern barbarian area was an infertile land. Therefore, the culture was immature, and most barbarians were not very civilized. And the behavior is also very cruel. Barbarian custom sacrifices to gods, using human heads as sacrifices. (Such as the three animals used for worship now.) Therefore, every time a sacrifice is made to the gods, several people must be sacrificed alive. In our opinion. What a tragic thing! But the barbarians did not think so.

When Zhuge Liang conquered the southern barbarians, he saw this tragic situation and felt it was very cruel. So he thought of a method, using flour to make bread, shaped like a human head, to replace human heads to worship the gods. It is called barbarian head, and now it is corrupted into steamed bun.

### A Week's Home Cooking Menu
— Ms. Jiuying

It is strange to say that bamboo shoots should have been eaten in the spring, but last December, they already appeared in the vegetable market. As usual, such particularly early seasonal goods should be particularly expensive, but they are cheaper than winter bamboo shoots. Even now, each liang is only about one jiao. Therefore, since entering winter, we have not eaten winter bamboo shoots but only bamboo shoots. The freshness of bamboo shoots is known to everyone, and they can be added to both vegetarian and vegetarian dishes. For example, for 蓂 dishes, you can use shredded bamboo shoots to stir-fry shredded meat, braised bamboo shoots with meat, and stewed pickled fresh bamboo shoots with bamboo shoots. Sliced bamboo shoots braised yellow croaker and braised 鮰 fish, etc. Vegetarian dishes such as winter brussels sprouts stir-fried sliced bamboo shoots, snow vegetables stir-fried diced bamboo shoots, and sliced bamboo shoots braised tofu, etc., cannot be described for a while, and housewives can use them according to their abilities.

### Plum House Plum Tasting Notes
— Zheng Yimei

In the morning of spring, the warm breeze is blowing, and the wisps of clouds are rolling. Zhou Zi Shoujuan invited me to taste the Righteous Man Plum that he had obtained. I went with Tao Lengyue, Jiang Yinqiu and Zi Yu to 　Hou. Shoujuan lives in the west of Shanghai, where the hustle and bustle of the city is faster. The environment is quiet and has a secluded charm, which is not easy to find in the ten-foot-tall red dust. Entering the room, I saw the plaque of Plum House, written by Huang Shangu, which was cleverly cut from the Chinese characters in his stele and carved. Shoujuan has a hermit habit. The paintings hanging on the wall are Wang Chaolin's panoramic plum blossom screen; Wu Kezhai's Snow Sea horizontal scroll; Wu Qiunong's Plum Blossom Searching Picture and Plum Blossom Bookstore fan screen; and the plum 　 are planted in pots, or planted in urns, or stored in Lei Dun; pots, urns, and Lei Dun, the styles are different, so the height, size, and thickness of the plums are all commensurate. The flowers have double 　, single petals, light crimson, and dark red, and occasionally there are pure white and unadorned ones. Is that the Lady of Guo Kingdom who lightly sweeps her eyebrows to meet the Supreme? The Righteous Man Plum is offered in the inner room, about three feet high, the old trunk is decayed, the holes are deep and mottled, and it is full of ancient 　; according to the age, it can be judged as a relic of the Ming Dynasty, the branches and flowers are lush, and the fragrance is pleasant. Lengyue then dipped his brush in ink to write a picture of the flowers, and discussed with Shoujuan which branches should be cut short and which branches should be drawn long, and others were sparse or dense, and the father reconsidered it for a long time. I asked why the Righteous Man Plum was named, and Shoujuan showed me the preface to his Righteous Man Plum poem, and then I knew that this plum came from the side of the Five People's Tomb in Wuzhong. The blood of Yin Ran turned into a strange flower, and I felt that the heroic spirit was still in the world. Yinqiu then wrote a poem to favor it, saying: "I have an appointment to come and visit the old plum, the pure posture and proud bones are blooming, the vicissitudes of life are always good in spring, and the heroic spirit does not dye the dust in the sky. For a while, Xu Zheng, Bai Shangsheng, Bo Sun, Xue Ni, Wang Geshi, Wang Yachen, Zheng Xiangqing and other sons came one after another, and Shoujuan guided them to climb the stairs. Then, all they saw were green dreams; in some small scenery, matched with copper and porcelain Bodhidharma, the ancient fragrance is mixed with Zen principles, which is even more fascinating. There are two silver cups, which are shining on the desk, which are the prizes won in the two flower planting meetings; how happy it is to increase the light internationally? After that, Shoujuan prepared several kinds of cakes and snacks to reward the guests, which were hand-made by his wife Fengjun, and were unparalleled in their precision and cleanliness, and each spoon and dish were decorated with plum patterns, with beautiful colors. I then said that Shoujuan's leisurely sentiments, if he were born during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, would be worthy of being in harmony with Shen Sanbai, but in times of turmoil, limited by material resources, he could not be as happy as he wanted, which is a pity. As the sun set in the west, I still bid farewell and returned with Lengyue Yinqiu.

Spring and Autumn

### The End of the Monkey Trainer
— Lieyan

"Damn it! Everything else is easy to do, why did I choose this line?"

Trapped in the stove shed, the monkey trainer cursed to himself. His small body was covered in countless large blisters. Because his stomach was not full, his neck looked particularly long. He sighed weakly and looked at the two animals hiding in the corner playing with chestnut shells. Like their master, they had not seen food for many days, and their fur was falling off like willow catkins.

He lazily lay down on a broken wooden bed, wrapped his body in a tattered quilt with the cotton wool pulled out, and memories flooded into his mind like tangled silk.

The year before last, his footprints were on every open space. When a short, thin man busily beat the gong, crowds of people gathered like flies.

"This short guy is very interesting. It's nice to hear him chattering."

"I think the monkey and dog performance is good. Look how the dog kneels like a human."

"Old man, you don't understand. The gimmick is all on the monkey trainer!"

They talked excitedly, and some children who joined in the fun shouted at the top of their lungs. He himself, however, shouted in a practiced tone:

"Hey! Darlings! Come here, go over there, open the box, put on your hats!"

When the dog jumped through the hoop, he changed his tricks: "Hey! Jump here, go through there, do a great job, the boss pays!"

Finally, he bowed as usual, the monkey bowed with a thud, and the dog raised its front legs and knelt on its hind legs, so the copper coins were thrown down one after another.

To put it bluntly, this was his only golden age. Not long after, the copper coins disappeared somehow. People just folded their arms and watched, laughing heartily. He still doesn't understand the reason. Is it because they were afraid that the divided tickets would be blown away by the wind, or is this thing not worth a penny?

But he was not in a hurry. With an old face and the ability to chatter, he was sure that people would dig into their pockets.

But God didn't open his eyes. The old open spaces were gradually surrounded by fences. The crowds of people in short clothes were sweating and desperately moving bricks and tiles, driving piles...

This urgency seemed to make his soul leave his body. But what can he do? The land is someone else's. His property, besides the monkeys and dogs, is only a wooden box with a hat on it.

When the tall buildings of cement and steel stood side by side, majestically reflected in front of his eyes, his two darlings who usually played tricks would never taste the fish and meat bought by the kings.

"God! Will fate get better?"

Lying on the bed, he thought blankly. The large blisters started to act up again, and the pain pierced his heart—his heart was broken too.

Suddenly, a sharp cry pierced his ears. He looked up in a daze and saw the landlady holding a broom fiercely. The dog was cowering at the edge of the bed, and the monkey had cleverly jumped onto the bed.

"Sorry, the animals are really not good!"

Understanding the situation, he immediately put on a smiling face.

"You haven't paid the rent for several months, but you're still raising these things to steal food!"

From her angry mouth, those piercing words came out.

He was silent, looking as if someone had poured a bucket of cold water over his head.

### Snowy Night
— Zhiyu

Magnificent tall buildings stand on both sides of the street. The dark night is gloomy, like a man-eating demon, it surrounds the tall buildings, so the lights from each window seem brighter. The flat asphalt road is like a long dead snake. Although it lies still quietly, every passerby is still apprehensive, wrapping their bodies tightly in coats, shrinking their heads into the high collar, and the leather shoes make a rustling sound on the ground. Occasionally, a few shiny cars pass by, roaring and cutting through the icy air. At the corner of the road, a street lamp is still emitting its tired light, and the shadows of the trees are shaken by the biting cold wind, turning into ferocious ghosts with teeth and claws.

Goose feather-like snowflakes fall piece by piece to the ground, covering the bare and barren trees, and laying a white quilt on the roof tiles. The bloated green mailbox is piled with snow like a polar bear bent over on the ground...

In a corner of a building, an elderly beggar with a body bent like a shrimp is crawling. His black skin, hair like dead grass, and thin and pitiful hands and feet, he tightly presses his back against the wall, trying to use this great building to block the cold attacks, but the ruthless cold wind, after all, drills into the tattered hundred-patched coat like sharp thorns. The old man's teeth began to clatter up and down. He slightly opened his lips and exhaled bursts of breath, trembling all over. His numb nerves felt an irresistible contraction... His eyesight and hearing were very blurred and lost their normal function. Snowflakes fell on his neck and turned into a drop of water due to the heat... He could not resist the painful blow, and his nerves trembled violently. His hands and feet were cramped, and his eyelids were still half open... He died!

Snowflakes are constantly flying, burying the poor old man, he will sleep forever and never wake up!

Dang! The evening bell of the church rang, as if praying, as if blessing... The sky is gloomy, as quiet as death.

### Begonia
— Qin Shouou

From the time her father went out, she sat by her mother's sickbed, accompanying her every moment. Her mother has been looking weaker recently, and a bad mood and insufficient nutrition are the two biggest reasons. Although Tingqi only came back yesterday, her mother wanted to say a lot to her, but the exhaustion of her energy made it very difficult for her to even speak.

"...This is the first difficulty..." Her mother struggled to say with great effort. "...Uncle...also...came...a letter...said that your brother's...disease...now...if we don't hurry...cure it...later there will be no...hope..." In front of Xiangqi, a thin young man immediately appeared, who was her only brother. But what can she do to help him? Even if she is a primary school teacher, she doesn't have money to pay for her brother's medical treatment!

"The family...is having bad luck...!" After a long silence, her mother continued to gasp and said, "...Your father...asked someone to look for...a job for half a year...and there is still no...news..." In fact, she didn't need her old man to say these things. When Xiangqi moved back from school yesterday, she was very clear in her heart when she saw the dilapidated situation at home. She remembered that there were a total of seven or eight boxes in her room, but now there are only four left. When she asked the mute maid who was sold from a young age, she made a circle with her thumb and chicken finger, and Xiangqi understood that it was sent to the longevity warehouse.

Of course, Xiangqi was at a loss for the difficulties of the family, because she was only a twenty-one-year-old girl, and there were too few things she could do other than reading and writing!

"I hope that Principal Hou will find Dad today and there will be good news for us." She tried her best to comfort her sick mother. "As long as I can earn thirty or forty yuan, the family can be a little more well-off.

A wry smile barely appeared on her mother's haggard face.

"Tell...you...Aunt Lu...is going to...come...again...today." Even a wry smile could not stay on her mother's face for long, and disappeared immediately in less than a minute.

"We owe...her...two hundred yuan...have not...paid...them interest...for more than...half a year...it is really...hard to...say..." (32)

### Covenant for Thrift by Zhu Xun

Several friends have formed a Thrift Society, drafting seven covenants to be jointly observed without fail. Violations of the covenants' articles will result in a corresponding fine, which will be used to assist refugees. At a time when the cost of living on this isolated island is increasing, it is especially important to economize on daily consumption. Moreover, thrift is an inherent virtue of the Chinese people, which the government is also vigorously promoting. However, people on the isolated island are accustomed to extravagance and competition in vanity, indulging in their habits and squandering money, which is truly frightening. If we do not urgently practice thrift, the consequences will be dire. Therefore, we publish the covenants below, hoping that readers will observe and encourage each other.

(1) Men shall not grow long hair, and women shall not perm their hair or use cosmetics.

(2) Food should satisfy hunger, not indulge in rich flavors.

(3) Clothing should not be flashy, only warm and cool, and should not be bizarre to confuse the public.

(4) When time permits, do not take transportation as a principle.

(5) Do not engage in pointless actions that waste mental, financial, and temporal resources.

(6) For all items, whether clothing, food, or daily necessities, make domestically produced goods the principle.

(7) Remaining money should be used for donations or disaster relief.

Although there are only seven items listed above, if they can be implemented, it will definitely save all kinds of extravagance, covering all aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Therefore, we record them here to share with readers to observe and respond to, hoping that all companies, firms, shops, families, and individuals will observe them together.

### "Acting Recklessly"

— Manqing

Last week, the International Cup match between the Chinese and Portuguese teams ended in a 3-3 draw after a penalty kick was scored in the final two minutes, much to the excitement of the crowd. Yesterday, the rematch took place in the midst of bitter winds and heavy rain, but the crowd was still just as packed, all hoping for the same thing: to win the International Cup. But how disappointing, 9-1!

Was it a disparity in the strength of the two sides? The 3-3 draw is the strongest counter-evidence. But how did the tragic score of 9-1 happen yesterday? One fan said: Lack of coordination.

Yes, it was a lack of coordination; but that is only half the story. The other half is that after the score reached 3-0, everyone started "acting recklessly," and then it was 6-1. At least they didn't get shut out.

However, we cannot bear to blame the Chinese team, because those who "act recklessly" are everywhere. For example, someone who loses money gambling will not put down the butcher knife and use other methods to make up for it, but will definitely "act recklessly," embezzling public funds and risking their life. Moreover, like a competition or a war, after being down 3-0 it is already "a second decline, and then exhaustion." Even if they score a goal when they are down 6-0, it is a spent force.

Therefore, holding on to "acting recklessly" is already a sign of "failure," whether it is gambling, competition, or even war.
