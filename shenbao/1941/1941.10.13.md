### Japanese Troops Besieged in a Corner of Western Hubei, Overwhelmed by Ten Divisions of Chinese Elite Forces; Japanese Positions in Jingmen and Shashi Repeatedly Breached by Chinese Troops; Fierce Fighting in the Suburbs of Yichang, Severing Japanese Rear Lines

Chongqing: Fierce fighting continues in the suburbs of Yichang. Japanese reinforcements attempted a counterattack yesterday but were repulsed by Chinese troops. The Moji Mountain area on the opposite bank of Yichang has also been largely cleared. Shashi and Dangyang are still under siege. Chinese units participating in the battle in western Hubei number ten divisions, equipped with heavy artillery and abundant strength. The Japanese troops entrenched on the west bank of the Hanshui River, consisting of elements of the 13th and 39th Divisions, have been swept by Chinese forces for days, their retreat cut off, and suffering heavy casualties. (12th Dispatch)

Yichang Front: Japanese troops besieged within Japanese strongholds in the suburbs of Yichang are still attempting to concentrate and harass. Chinese troops are simultaneously controlling Yichang city and launching attacks on their smaller strongholds. On the 11th, over a thousand Japanese troops at Qiuyu Terrace were eliminated by Chinese forces, with over 800 Japanese killed and the remainder fleeing towards Kanmen. In the Jingmen and Shashi area, Japanese positions such as those in Wancheng, Dapu Street, and Shitaozi have all been breached by Chinese forces, with numerous captures. The remnants retreated to Jiangling. (11th Dispatch) The news from the Yichang front in Chongqing is quieter today. Informed Chinese sources say there are no changes. The remnants of the Japanese army are holding out in major buildings, resisting stubbornly. Once the Chinese artillery arrives, an effective clearing operation can be launched, as these Japanese troops are completely cut off from the outside world. If Japanese reinforcements cannot arrive in time, they will either surrender or die. (11th Havas Dispatch) According to General Xue Yue's Headquarters in Chongqing.

### Victorious Chinese Forces on the Southwest and West Roads Threaten to Encircle Hankou; Xue Yue Reports Glorious Battle Results; Foreign Journalists Leave Hunan for Chongqing

Chongqing: General Xue Yue's Headquarters announced that six divisions of Chinese chasing troops crossed the Xinqiang River yesterday and are fighting fiercely with Japanese troops in the expanding battle lines near the suburbs of Yueyang to the north. (12th Dispatch)

Changde: Chinese troops north of Hunan who crossed the Xinqiang River are sweeping the area near Yueyang. Japanese warships have disappeared from Dongting Lake. (10th Dispatch)

Changde: No trace of Japanese troops can be found in the Nanshan and Haogoutouzhou areas opposite Yueyang. (10th Dispatch)

Changsha: According to reliable sources, Chinese forces are currently encircling Hankou from the southwest and west roads. Furthermore, reports from various sources indicate that, to minimize the opportunity for the Japanese army to regroup after their defeat in Changsha, Chinese troops are advancing eastward from Yichang, while other Chinese units in northern Hunan have crossed the Xinqiang River and are encircling Yuezhou. It is reported that while the Battle of Changsha was underway, two Japanese detachments infiltrated the northeastern suburbs of Changsha. While Chinese defending forces engaged in street fighting with the Japanese soldiers, Chinese reinforcements crossed the Xinqiang River and arrived. The Chinese Air Force also provided effective assistance, bombing Japanese positions three times in two days. When the battle became intense, a large number of Chinese refugees took refuge in foreign churches. When British and American missionaries asked the Japanese to protect these refugees, the Japanese responded coldly, but they provided various conveniences and preferential treatment to German and Italian missionaries. The water barriers and mines laid by the Chinese forces in the lower reaches of the Xiang River disrupted the Japanese attempt to advance along the river towards Changsha. Several divisions of Chinese troops retreating from the front lines were ordered by General Xue Yue to reorganize within three days and return to the front lines. This was a major factor in the ability of the Chinese forces to hold Changsha. Approximately 160 Japanese prisoners have been gathered here and will soon be transferred to Chongqing.

The Battle of Changsha can be divided into five phases:

(1) The Battle of Dayun Mountain; (2) The Forcible Crossing of the Xinqiang River; (3) The Battle Along the Laodao River; (4) The Chinese Counterattack; (5) The pursuit battle. It is said that the last stage is still in progress. The Sichuan and Yunnan armies performed admirably in the fierce fighting between the Laodao, Liuyang, and two rivers. When the Japanese army attacked Changsha, the Chinese artillery fired from Yuelu Mountain on the west bank of the Xiang River, bombarding the northeast city. After inquiring from soldiers, officers, farmers, and railway workers who had experienced battle along the way in Hengyang, Lukou, Zhuzhou, and Xiangtan, we have a clearer understanding of the course of the battle. We know that Chinese strategy, Japanese overconfidence, and the weather were the main reasons for the Chinese victory. The strength used by the Japanese in launching the offensive surprised the Chinese, as the Japanese army, on September 17, when forcibly crossing the Xinqiang River at Guanwang Bridge, mobilized a division against a Chinese company. At that time, the speed of the Japanese advance made many worry that Chinese reinforcements would not arrive in time to defend Changsha. However, from September 21 to 23, during the height of the battle,

A Heavy Rain Fell for Three Days

The muddy roads delayed the Japanese advance, while Chinese reinforcements arrived at the Laodao River positions. When General Xue Yue received the foreign press corps visiting Changsha, he said that the battle was continuing and the amount of losses was still difficult to estimate. According to informal reports from Chinese commanders and battlefield medical teams that have not yet been verified, the numbers of Japanese deaths and injuries and the number of prisoners and war materials captured by the Chinese forces are as follows: As of October 8, the Chinese forces had buried 41,250 Japanese corpses, and 312 Japanese soldiers were captured. The war materials captured by the Chinese army included 1,230 horses, 7,240 rifles, 12 mountain guns, 35 mortars and direct-fire guns, 241 machine guns, and 120 pistols. In addition, 57 tanks and 130 armored vehicles were destroyed, 3 gunboats and 56 motorboats were sunk, and 3 aircraft were shot down. Xue also said that the Japanese forces used in this battle of Changsha included the entire strength of four divisions, part of two divisions, two independent brigades, four artillery and engineering detachments, 180 aircraft, 30 warships, and 200 motorboats. In addition, 150,000 Chinese laborers were gathered to build roads behind the Japanese lines. The depth of this battle line was 70 miles, and the length was 50 miles. The Japanese army widely used the Fifth Column (each infantry platoon was accompanied by 30 plainclothes soldiers) and paratroopers (about 30 at a time) to disrupt the Chinese army in battle. However, Xue emphasized that the Chinese army effectively dealt with them with reserves, so the main combat troops were not affected. Xue also said that powerful Chinese columns are attacking along highways and railways. The Japanese army can only retreat along the Yangtze River northwest via Yuezhou. After receiving the reporters, Xue met separately with Colonel Falase, a British military attache, and Major Maguelun, an American assistant naval attache. The details of the beginning and end of the Japanese attack on Changsha and the vicinity of Zhuzhou may never be known, but some aspects can be gleaned from the facts gathered from various reliable sources. It is said that on September 27, a Japanese detachment

The defending troops refused to give up the city

Attacked Changsha at night, but engaged in fierce street fighting for two days until the Japanese detachment was wiped out. Regarding the battle of Zhuzhou, it is generally said that a Japanese cavalry detachment broke through the Chinese lines east of Changsha and infiltrated an area north of Zhuzhou Station, but two Chinese regiments arrived in Zhuzhou two hours earlier and immediately engaged in battle and wiped them out. The highest Chinese estimate of Japanese losses is about 70,000, with 5,000 captured, while the lowest estimate is 30,000 dead and 700 captured. According to soldiers at the front, the Japanese army suffered the heaviest losses during the retreat, as a large number of Japanese troops were surrounded by the Chinese forces near Fulinpu, so many were captured. It is also said that the Japanese army had a total of seven divisions, reaching 150,000 men. (12th Reuters Dispatch)

Changsha: The foreign journalists and British and American military officials who came to Changsha to inspect left Changsha for Chongqing on the morning of the 12th. The inspection team stayed in Changsha for three full days, during which they visited the battlefields of Yangxuanshan and Hupandu in the eastern suburbs, visited Commander Xia Chuzhong, who was holding Changsha, and foreigners staying in Changsha, and then went to the front line to visit Commander Xue, with whom they spoke four times. They had good impressions and observations. The team obtained detailed information on the Japanese invasion of Changsha, the strong counterattack by the Chinese army, and the various facts about the Japanese soldiers. They returned fully loaded with information. At the same time, they expressed their admiration for the brave fighting spirit of the Chinese army and the cooperation of the residents. On the morning of the 12th, the reporters and military officials said goodbye to Commander Xue. At the time of departure, their reluctance revealed the sincerity of their deep feelings, symbolizing the spirit of unity among the democratic countries of China, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

### After the Recovery of Yichang, There is No Fear of Food Shortages in Sichuan; The Food Problem for the People Can Be Solved From Now On

Chongqing: An official from the Ministry of Food told a United Press reporter today that if Yichang can be held after its recovery, Sichuan Province will not have to worry about food shortages. Since Yichang fell two years ago, Chinese troops on the central Yangtze River front have not been able to obtain rice from Hunan Province, and have had to rely on Sichuan, leading to food shortages in Sichuan. But after the recovery of Yichang, it can be transported to northern Hubei, southern Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. This development can lower the price of rice in Sichuan. The Ministry of Food of the National Government is making every effort to collect sufficient rice and wheat from hoarders to supply the army and the people. In particular, landlords in Sichuan Province are hoarding for profit. The government has promulgated severe penalties to stop this situation. In January, Mayor Yang Quanyu of Chengdu was executed as a warning to hoarders and speculators. In the second half of this year, the government plans to obtain 1.2 million shi of grain from Sichuan through two methods, namely, paying taxes in grain and issuing food warehouse bonds. The Food Ministry is entirely responsible for this procedure. Since the establishment of the Ministry of Food, it has been proceeding smoothly. Chairman Chiang is also very concerned about this and has ordered the Sichuan Provincial Government to severely punish those who dare to hinder the procedure. The government's grain acquisition program is progressing well in this province and will be extended to other provinces of Free China next year. Officials predict that it will be a success and assure reporters that there will be no serious food shortages or famine next winter. Chongqing announced a rationing system in September, but because of the good harvest this autumn, the system was not strictly enforced. The current price of rice in Chongqing is double that of last October, from 350 yuan per shi last year to 700 yuan this year, but the current price of rice is much lower than that of May and June, when rice was about 900 yuan per shi. It is expected that the price of rice will fall further after the recovery of Yichang, so the food problem in Free China will be easier than recently expected. (12th United Press Dispatch)

### The Savings Movement Has Been Implemented for One Year; The Total Amount Will Reach 600 Million Yuan; Chongqing Has the Best Results and is the Champion of All Provinces and Cities; Overseas Chinese Are Very Enthusiastic About the Savings Movement

Chongqing: The patriotic construction savings movement, which began on the Double Tenth Festival last year, has reached a total savings of 560 million yuan after one year. In terms of provinces and cities, Chongqing ranks first, followed by Guangdong Province. Yunnan, Sichuan, and Fujian are also strong, all exceeding 30 million yuan. Others exceeding 10 million yuan are Gansu, Shaanxi, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Guizhou, and Shanghai. Overseas Chinese are also very enthusiastic about this movement, with a total savings of 97.3 million yuan. If this is also calculated as a unit, it would rank first among all provinces and cities. What is even more commendable is that they instruct their families on household remittance orders to purchase savings bonds every month. Therefore, Meixian County in Guangdong Province alone reached 20 million yuan, and Quanzhou and Nan'an in Fujian Province also exceeded 10 million yuan each, which is truly inspiring. (11th Havas Dispatch)

Luoyang: As of September, the total savings of the Henan Savings Movement reached more than 7.5 million yuan. (10th Dispatch)

Editorial

### International Fluctuations in the Intense Soviet-German War

Recently, the German army has launched a fierce attack on the Soviet Union, achieving considerable progress in the central and southern sectors. As a result, the already unsettled international situation is like a stone thrown into a pool of spring water, causing ripples in all directions. In Britain, there is a continuous debate on whether to immediately attack the European continent; in Japan, the rhetoric of northward advance and aggression has become more intense; the Nazis themselves are trying to take advantage of this small victory to reap the benefits of diplomatic offensives in the Far East; and between the United States and Japan, news of compromise and rupture is heard alternately. Even the task of sending three Japanese ships to the United States has been met with conflicting rumors, some saying they are being used to evacuate overseas Japanese, others saying it is a "temporary solution to the transportation difficulties for passengers and goods," which only increases the bewilderment of those concerned about the situation. All of these things have their own inherent causes and effects, but they are undoubtedly influenced by the Soviet-German war, and will continue to develop with changes in the war situation.

In the recent Soviet-German war, the central and southern sectors are the most intense. In the northern sector, which had previously approached the outskirts of Leningrad, the German side does not seem to place much emphasis. This shows that the Nazis are taking a desperate gamble, trying to achieve the effect of annihilating the main Soviet forces and opening up the path to the east in one fell swoop with a two-pronged approach. Therefore, in terms of military strength, they have mobilized the largest and final strength, and in terms of strategy, they are single-mindedly extending their wings and going deep, implementing pincer encirclements. The Nazi authorities are undoubtedly responding to the recently concluded Tripartite Conference, wanting to defeat the Soviet Union before British and American aid arrives as much as possible, risking collapse if they do not win. The Soviet Union's resistance cannot be underestimated, but it is obviously quite difficult to defeat the German offensive, so the seriousness of this war need not be concealed. Of course, even if the Nazis win, it will only be like the lingering heat of late autumn, which cannot end the Eastern Front war and is not a guarantee of success for the future of violence. However, after this upheaval, the forces of violence will inevitably experience a period of arrogance and recklessness, making the work of restoring order even more difficult. The recent developments in the international arena mentioned above show these signs to some extent. Whether Western or Eastern aggressors, they are currently focused on the fighting around Moscow, regarding it as the foundation of their own future, and are in practice pulling the trigger, waiting for news of a Nazi victory to launch new offensive steps.

The current problem is how to deal with reality, not simply to pursue past faults, but if we review the development of the international situation in the past three months, there are things that we cannot help but say. The outbreak of the Soviet-German war was a misfortune for the people of Eastern Europe, but it was also a major turning point for democratic countries, on the one hand promoting the ideal of joint warfare between democratic countries and the Soviet Union, and on the other hand putting the Nazis in danger of fighting on two fronts, while democratic countries gained ample time to prepare, and it was also an opportunity to cut off the wings of the Nazis while they were busy with their own affairs. However, in these three months, the German army has only fought on one front, the Eastern Front, while the gains of the democratic countries have been few and far between. Of course, if it were not for the opportunity of the Soviet-German war, the Syrian campaign might not have been resolved quickly, and the consolidation of the Iranian situation would have been fundamentally impossible; but that is all that has been accomplished. After two or three months of preparation, the issue of aid to the Soviet Union began to be concretely resolved before Moscow was besieged. In the Western Front, in North Africa, and even in the Atlantic, there has been no concrete launch of a counterattack against Germany; especially in the Far East, except for the fact that aid to China and the preparations for the ABCD response have developed considerably, in fact, the situation is not much more advanced than it was three months ago. The North Pacific has continued to be exposed and unprotected, but valuable energy and time have been wasted on fruitless talks. If it is said that the strong measures taken by Britain and the United States in the Far East not long ago had the effect of ordering a halt, this effect will soon disappear with the slightest change in the Soviet-German war. Yesterday, it was reported that Konoe had made a new proposal to the United States. Regardless of whether the content of the reported proposal is reliable, it can be asserted that it must be closely related to the current international situation, and is somewhat threatening in nature. All of this is not intended to criticize the British and American authorities, but only to point out that if Britain and the United States had taken more agile and proactive measures in the past three months, and concentrated their efforts to implement a decisive goal, not only would the Soviet Union not have been defeated, but the situation of Britain and the United States themselves would have been much better than it is now.

Even so, the current situation is only critical, and there is no reason for pessimism. Let us imagine the worst possible future: at most, the Nazis will have taken Moscow, and Japan will carry out a northward advance, or the democratic countries and Japan will finally break apart, and American participation in the war will be inevitable; but whether it is the Nazis or Japan, no matter how arrogant they may be, the three or four months of the Eastern Front war, regardless of who wins or loses, will have almost exhausted their vitality. Even if Hitler gets what he wants materially, he will not be able to engage in a decisive battle with the rested and prepared Britain and the United States without a considerable period of recuperation and full preparation. As for the current strength of Japan, the world is well aware of it, and there are more recent and clear facts to verify it. Mental excitement cannot compensate for its depleted resources and exhausted manpower. The Japanese authorities are not keen on accepting the German diplomatic offensive in the Far East, but are instead preparing to continue negotiations with the United States at this time, perhaps precisely because they are aware of their own weaknesses. It is just that the ideal of the general public is to eliminate violence before it succeeds, and not to receive the result of suppressing chaos after civilization and humanity have universally suffered the greatest devastation. In terms of seizing the initiative, although it may be slightly late now, it is still not too late for the last opportunity. If we continue to delay in taking proactive actions, and only take dilatory or inadequate measures, then the clearing of the overall situation in the future may inevitably come after a greater catastrophe for the world!

### The Current Negotiations Will Ultimately Fail. The United States and Japan Agree to Exchange Nationals. Three Japanese Merchant Ships Are About to Sail to the United States. Tokyo's Outcries Leave the United States Unmoved.

Reuters, Washington, 12th. The State Department announced yesterday that the U.S. has agreed with Japan to allow three Japanese ships to enter U.S. ports to transport American nationals who wish to return home from Japan, and to carry Japanese individuals currently waiting for passage in the U.S. back to Japan. It is understood here that about 600 Japanese nationals are remaining on the U.S. West Coast awaiting passage back to Japan.

International News Agency, Tokyo, 12th. The Foreign Ministry announced yesterday that the Japanese Mail Steamship Company's magnificent mail ship, "Tatsuta Maru," will sail to the United States next Wednesday. This ship is the first Japanese vessel to set sail for the United States under the national repatriation agreement established with Washington. Since Japan invaded Vietnam in July of this year and the United States implemented the freezing order, the "Tatsuta Maru" has led fifty Japanese ships in leaving the U.S. West Coast.

United Press, Tokyo, 12th. Unofficial Japanese sources have learned that three Japanese ships will sail to the United States and Canada this month, and are now pessimistic about the outcome of talks with Washington. They also stated that the situation between the Soviet Union and Germany will most likely influence Japan's policies and U.S.-Japan negotiations. According to the Foreign Ministry's announcement, the three Japanese ships sailing to the United States and Canada are intended to "temporarily alleviate the difficulties of passenger and goods transport." The British and American embassies and the Canadian mission here are privately advising their respective nationals to make use of these three Japanese ships to return home.

Havas, Washington, 12th. Political figures here recently stated that relations between the United States and Japan are once again becoming strained, and the ongoing negotiations between the two countries will ultimately fail. Although Japanese newspapers have maintained a moderate attitude towards the United States in recent weeks, they have resumed attacking the U.S. government today. This is completely contrary to the attitude of Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Admiral Nomura, which is quite noteworthy. However, the failure of U.S.-Japan negotiations is almost inevitable, as the Japanese government only intends to use the U.S.-Japan negotiations to delay and await major developments in the European situation. By this point, Japan has seen that its proposed promises cannot induce the United States to make concrete concessions, namely, to stop aid to China and recognize the results of Japan's aggression in Asia. Conversely, the unexpected success of the German army on the Eastern Front has led Japan to believe that there will soon be important developments in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, and that Japan can rest easy when taking action in the Pacific.

Washington, 11th, Special Dispatch. The recent large-scale attacks on the United States by Japanese newspapers and spokespersons have failed to attract the attention or concern of official Washington. The U.S. government will not be appeased by Japan's verbal threats. Japan's outcry against the United States is likely due to German pressure on Japan, and is also related to the temporary victories of the German army in the Soviet Union. It is generally felt that the U.S.-Japan (armed truce) attitude created after Japanese Prime Minister Konoe sent a letter to U.S. President Roosevelt is coming to an end. Although all parties believe that Minister Nosugi of the Embassy will try to get the United States to reduce its economic restrictions on Japan, Secretary of State Hull stated today when meeting with reporters that he knew nothing about the rumored Japanese attempt to conclude a temporary agreement with the United States. Judging from various reports received here, the recent talks among representatives from China, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and the representatives in Manila, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Chongqing have made Japan deeply fearful. The threatening outcry issued by Japan is simply a reflection of how severely Japan has been hit by economic sanctions. The exaggerated rhetoric made in Tokyo has only made the American people more disgusted with Japan and forced the U.S. government to take an even more resolute stance in implementing its Far East policy. American newspapers have recently placed great emphasis on China's achievements, saying that British and American aid to China has begun to show its effect, plunging Japan into a predicament of strategic and diplomatic dilemma. The "Washington Post" wrote today that the exploratory talks between the United States and Japan were destined to fail from the day they began, because Japan cannot withdraw from China, and the United States does not want to stop aiding China in resisting Japanese aggression. The "New York Herald Tribune" stated that the Japanese offensive has failed. Although the Japanese army occupied Zhengzhou, its progress has lost momentum, not only is its movement chaotic, but it is also bogged down in a quagmire. China has made a significant contribution to its allies, thwarting Japan's ambition to expand its influence elsewhere.

United Press, Tokyo, 12th. The newspapers here continued their anti-American tone today and warned that, under no circumstances, can Japan abandon its dream of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. "Kokumin Shimbun" commented that Japan will never succumb to American threats. The newspaper stated that Ambassador Nomura and his advisor Nosugi should know that the Japanese people are prepared to die in order to eliminate all obstacles to building a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere that rivals the new European order. The newspaper said that the current negotiations between Japan and the United States will be extremely difficult in the future. If the negotiations break down, then the United States should be held responsible. "Chugai Shimbun" commented on the development of the Soviet-German war and predicted that the United States' policy on this may change. It also stated that regardless of any international developments, Japan's policy is based on the establishment of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and must abide by the Tripartite Pact.

U.S. Senator Advises the Government: Appeasing Japan Will Only Breed Trouble for Future Generations

Havas, Washington, 11th. Democratic Senator Gillette met with Secretary of State Hull today to discuss the investigation of the activities of Japanese consular officials in the United States. Afterwards, according to Hull, the two only exchanged views. Senator Gillette and another Democratic Senator Johnson jointly submitted a bill to the Senate last week requesting that a report be compiled based on the results of the investigation of the establishment of anti-American groups in the United States by personnel from the Axis powers. Senator Gillette himself stated, "It is time to abandon the policy of appeasement towards Japan. If Germany defeats the Soviet Union, then Japan's expansion of war in the Far East can almost be predicted. We will one day discover that the gasoline and other military supplies shipped to Japan over the years are all tools for Japan to attack us in the future." Regarding the issue of foreign espionage, "I propose that the number of diplomatic personnel from various countries enjoying diplomatic privileges in the United States should be reduced. Regarding the fact that Japanese diplomatic personnel in the United States represent the Axis powers and engage in various activities that are contrary to American interests, if the investigation proves to be true in the future, I suggest that they be deported."

### Dutch East Indies Army Chief of Staff Visits the Philippines to Attend a Meeting to Discuss Military Cooperation to Deal with Contingencies. Australian and New Zealand Ministers of the Army to Inspect Malaya

Reuters, Manila, 12th. According to a message from the U.S. Far East Military Headquarters last night, the Chief of Staff of the Dutch East Indies Army, General Poorten, is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow by Dutch plane to hold a meeting with local military authorities to discuss everything. General MacArthur, Commander of the U.S. Far East Military Headquarters, said that the U.S. Far East Military Headquarters is very interested in the efforts of the Dutch East Indies Army to defend the area and expressed admiration.

Reuters, Tokyo, 12th. "Nichinichi Shimbun" reported that the visit of Dutch East Indies Army Chief of Staff General Poorten to Manila is seen here as having extremely important significance for the strengthening of the ABCD line of defense in the South Pacific. Poorten's trip is clearly a reciprocation of the recent visit to the Dutch East Indies by Brigadier General Clagett, Commander of the Philippine Army Air Corps. Poorten is expected to arrive in Manila.

Reuters, Sydney, 12th. Reuters has learned that Australia's new Minister for the Army, Forde, will travel to Malaya after Christmas to inspect the Australian troops stationed in Malaya.

### Ten Thousand International Youth Gather in London. Representatives from Twenty Countries, Including German and Italian Youth, Participate. Issue a Declaration Vowing to Never Coexist with Nazism

Reuters, London, 12th. Last night, ten thousand people participated in the International Youth Victory Rally, representing twenty countries. In addition to representatives from Allied countries and various friendly nations, as well as the Soviet Union and the United States, there were also German and Italian youth. In a declaration to the world's youth, the representatives stated, "We will be the pioneers in the struggle. Our motto is 'Work, Serve, and Fight for Freedom.' We will not rest until Nazism and Fascism are completely eliminated. We will turn Britain into a large arsenal. We are preparing for the day of attack in the West." King George VI sent a message to the conference saying that the conference showed that young men and women today clearly understand the true meaning of the current struggle. British Prime Minister Churchill also sent a message, stating that those who won past wars were the fighting spirit of the country's youth in resisting the enemy. Today's youth are still on the front lines of the battlefield, but the men and women who work in factories have the same responsibility as the youth on the front lines. All those who come from countries temporarily ravaged by heinous dictatorships also have their responsibilities. If everyone fulfills their responsibilities, then victory can be assured.

### Cuba Holds "One Bowl of Rice Movement" Rally. Minister Li Presides Over the Opening Ceremony. The Cuban Government Deeply Sympathetic to China.

Havana, 10th, Special Dispatch. Cuba's "One Bowl of Rice Movement" rally was opened today by Minister Li Dijun. In the past ten days, Cuban newspapers and radio stations have actively promoted the event. The Cuban Prime Minister, Minister of National Defense, British Minister to Cuba, Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires, and other leaders from all walks of life have also delivered speeches on this issue. According to Minister Li's estimate, 40,000 people participated in today's rally, including the Cuban Vice President and his wife, cabinet members, and diplomatic delegations from various countries. The Mukden Times Orchestra played the Chinese national anthem, followed by a speech by Cuban Minister of National Defense Domingo Lamar representing the Cuban government, stating that several hundred overseas Chinese had bravely participated in Cuba's war for independence. Currently, there are 30,000 overseas Chinese in Cuba, who have made significant contributions to Cuba's progress.

### Soviet Mechanized Reinforcements Continuously Head to the Central Front Line

Vyazma Invaded Soviet Positions, Little Change in the Battle of Bryansk

Reuters, Moscow, 12th - A special correspondent for the Red Army newspaper "Red Star" reported last night that a powerful force is being transferred to the central front to support the troops under the command of Timoshenko, who are currently under pressure. The reinforcements include heavy tank units, mechanized infantry, artillery, and cavalry. Various supplies are continuously being transported to the front lines, and transportation is proceeding smoothly without any delays or congestion. Although enemy aircraft are attempting to disrupt transportation, Soviet fighter planes are countering them. The current reinforcements are fresh troops, full of morale, and led by experienced officers, aiming to block the enemy and break their pincer formation.

Reuters, Moscow - A reporter reports that on Friday, German forces penetrated Soviet positions on the Vyazma front. The Bryansk region, where German forces suffered heavy losses last week, has now seen the arrival of new German reinforcements. Fierce fighting has continued in the past 24 hours. Despite the enemy's fierce attacks, there is no news of major changes in Bryansk. The Soviet troops' calm response, the bravery and activity of Soviet dive bombers, and the arrival of newly trained Soviet troops have halted the German advance at both Bryansk and Orel. In the past 24 hours, the German forces have made little progress north of Orel. According to various sources, the German forces have suffered heavy losses. Soviet troops are currently engaged in counter-offensives on the Leningrad front. The German advance on Murmansk has been halted, and the situation in Odessa is gradually improving. The Soviets are well aware of the current serious situation of the German offensive on the central front and the intensity of the fighting on both sides of the Sea of Azov. However, they believe that the arrival of a large number of reinforcements on the front lines will be able to reverse the precarious situation.

TASS, Moscow, 12th - Fighting on the southwestern front was fierce all day. The enemy launched continuous attacks, resulting in a breakthrough in our defense line in a certain area. Fierce fighting is still in progress. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. Our pilots destroyed 100 German trucks carrying soldiers, 150 ammunition trucks, 15 artillery pieces, and a train of gasoline trucks.

Reuters, London, 12th - According to the Soviet midnight communique broadcast by Moscow Radio, fighting continued along the entire front yesterday, with Vyazma and Bryansk being the most intense. On October 9th, 64 German aircraft were shot down, and the Soviets lost 25 aircraft. On October 9th and 10th, 12 German aircraft were shot down near Ingersk.

International News Agency, Moscow, 12th - The Soviet Command admitted yesterday that the Soviet forces on the southern front, fighting with their backs to the city, had to retreat slightly due to the large number of German troops. The positions near Moscow are now under threat. "Red Star" stated, "The enemy's reinforcements are arriving continuously, so they have made some progress by virtue of their numerical superiority. However, the German troops suffer heavy losses with each advance. A large number of Soviet reinforcements, supplemented by a massive mechanized force, are now rushing to the front lines to assist Marshal Timoshenko's troops and prevent the German troops from advancing on the Soviet capital. Although German aircraft are trying to prevent these reinforcements from reaching the front lines, the Soviet reinforcements are still able to ensure their progress. They are all elite reserves and have all kinds of the latest equipment." "Pravda" stated that although the German troops have sacrificed a large amount of manpower and material resources, they still want to continue their advance on Moscow.

Reuters, London, 12th - According to Moscow Radio, British and Soviet fighter planes shot down a total of 29 German bombers and fighter planes in the Murmansk area in the past three weeks. Soviet Squadron Leader Safonov personally shot down 15 enemy aircraft in this area.

Reuters, Berlin, 2nd - The German High Command announced that the fighting on the Sea of Azov has now ended. The majority of the Soviet 9th and 18th Armies have been destroyed. 64,325 Soviet troops were captured, and 125 tanks, 519 artillery pieces, and many other war materials were lost. Since September 26th, the Germans have captured a total of 106,365 Soviet soldiers and seized 212 tanks and 672 artillery pieces.

German Side Admits Occupying the Russian Capital Still Requires Great Sacrifice from the German People

Havas, Berlin, 12th - A broadcast here stated that although the German troops have defeated General Timoshenko's Red Army, paving the way for a direct assault on Moscow, the German occupation of the Russian capital still requires effort and sacrifice from the German people, because the Soviet Union will definitely defend Moscow with all its strength. The current German-Soviet war can be compared to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. After the Prussian army won the Battle of Sedan, even though the French army no longer had the possibility of victory, it still could not directly approach the gates of Paris.

Soviet Union Orders Evacuation of Women and Children from the Capital in Preparation for Bombing

International News Agency, Moscow, 12th - The Soviet High Command admitted yesterday that the Red Army on the central front has been forced to retreat to a new defense zone due to the German army's resolute advance. Earlier, the Soviet Supreme Commander Stalin had ordered that all women and children and those not involved in the war must be evacuated from Moscow. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and government spokesman Lozovsky explained that the evacuation order was "a bombing prevention plan. The Soviet government will remain in the Kremlin." The Red Army High Command communique admitted yesterday that the Soviet Union had retreated in the Vyazma and Bryansk areas, but claimed that the Soviet army "eliminated enemy manpower and military equipment" during the retreat. The communique also stated that the battles in the above two areas are the largest and bloodiest battles in history.

German Offensive Becomes More Fierce, Situation in Moscow Quite Serious

Reuters, London, 12th - It is heard that the German offensive against Moscow is becoming more fierce. Although the Soviet troops are resisting bravely, the situation is said to be quite serious. The German High Command announced that the German troops have captured 200,000 people in the pocket areas of Vyazma and Bryansk. The Soviet troops are resisting fiercely and suffering heavy losses. The 1,200-kilometer battle line starting from the Valdai Hills is now continuing to extend eastward. The Soviet communique stated that on Saturday, Soviet troops killed more than 4,000 German soldiers in a certain area and destroyed 80 of their tanks. In a certain area in the southwest, German troops attempted to invade the Soviet defense line and 2,200 were killed. Large-scale guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas is very successful, killing several German officers and capturing transport vehicles and military supplies. In addition, an important bridge and several sections of railway were bombed and destroyed.

Both Sides of the Soviet-German Conflict Unanimously Deny US Reports of Ceasefire Agreement

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th - According to German officials, the American news agency published news that Germany had proposed a ceasefire to the Soviet Union, and mentioned that well-informed sources believed that this proposal was absolutely possible and was a method commonly used by Germany in this situation. In fact, it is a stupid rumor. The current Soviet army has been defeated. It is absurd and ridiculous to speculate that Germany is proposing a ceasefire. Moreover, the news agency should remember that after France was defeated, it was not Germany that proposed a ceasefire, but France that requested a ceasefire.

Reuters, Moscow, 12th - Soviet spokesman Lozovsky stated last night that the Soviet Union will not stop fighting until the German troops are destroyed on Soviet territory. The battle of Moscow has proved that Hitler will not be able to achieve his goals in the current offensive. The Soviet government absolutely believes that even if Hitler can win a hundred battles, he will ultimately not be able to achieve final victory, because the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States have unanimously responded to Hitler.

TASS, Moscow, 12th - The New York Times reported that Stalin received a letter from President Roosevelt during the Big Three conference. The letter was telegraphed by the Soviet High Command to the front lines, and was therefore discovered by the German side. TASS has been officially authorized to declare that the Soviet High Command has never and cannot leak President Roosevelt's letter in the wireless army. The New York Times report, from beginning to end, every word is fabricated.

### British Public Urges Government to Take Swift Action to Aid Soviet Union

Launch Offensive in Europe to Restrain Nazi Forces and Closely Monitor Japan's Future Attitude

Reuters, London, 12th - The number of people from all walks of life requesting the British government to take action to restrain the German offensive against Moscow is increasing daily. Workers from various machinery factories in Leeds have sent a message to Prime Minister Churchill, requesting that a second battlefield be established in the West as quickly as possible. General Sir Milne published an article in the "Sunday Dispatch" warning the people not to be too optimistic about the current situation. Students from the University College Hospital in London have presented a resolution to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for War. Employees of the Oxford Machinery Factory have also decided to telegraph the Prime Minister with the same request. The famous writer H.G. Wells also wrote an article in the "Sunday Express" urging Britain to launch an offensive in Europe. On the other hand, those who oppose the British invasion of Europe have also expressed their opinions, and some have even criticized the above request as crazy. Former Secretary of State for War, Hore-Belisha, has issued a moderate opinion, saying that if Britain cannot create a second battlefield, it can clear the Mediterranean route to ensure the smooth transportation of supplies to the Soviet Union. There is also an essay by a contributor in the "Sunday Dispatch" stating that a concrete plan to aid the Soviet Union is for Britain and the United States to guarantee against Japanese attacks, so that the Soviet Union can transfer its Far East troops to the eastern front to fight. At the same time, as the situation on the eastern front becomes increasingly serious, the general public is observing Japan's attitude towards the Soviet Union with great attention.

### Soviet Oil Tankers to Depart US for Vladivostok Soon with Oil

International News Agency, Los Angeles, 12th - It was revealed yesterday that three Soviet oil tankers will leave the Port of Los Angeles within 14 days, carrying 2,500,000 gallons of aviation gasoline to Vladivostok.

### Mass Poisoning of Journalists Occurs in Prague, Czech Republic

Due to Czech People's Hatred of Pro-German Journalists, This Planned Group Murder Was Carried Out

Haitong News Agency, Prague, 12th - A shocking mass poisoning of a group of Czech journalists suddenly occurred here. The editor-in-chief of "Czechoslovomo" newspaper even died as a result, causing unrest throughout the Czech protectorate. Several Czech journalists from major newspapers in Prague received invitations a few days ago, setting a banquet at a former residence of a Czech celebrity on Friday. After the banquet, all the journalists developed symptoms of poisoning. They rushed to a German hospital for examination and discovered that it was a planned group poisoning plot. The core of the conspiracy is due to the hostility towards the Czech journalists who have been involved in the new order implemented since 1939. The motive for the murder is that foreign radio broadcasts have been making inciting propaganda, advocating the assassination of the journalists, and Czech exiles have also been urging their countrymen to punish the journalists. The editor-in-chief who died of poisoning, Karlinuwski, died shortly after being admitted to the German hospital. The funeral will be held with extremely solemn ceremonies within days, ordered and presided over by Reinhardt, the acting governor of the German protectorate. According to Reinhardt, the widow of the deceased will be given a minister's salary as compensation. The authorities are also investigating the murderer.

Number of People Killed in the South Reaches Over 300,000

Reuters, London, 12th - According to a Stanispol report received by the Independent French News Agency, an observer who arrived in Stanispol from the South said that the number of men, women, and children massacred in the South is between 330,000 and 340,000. The highest religious organization in the southern capital submitted a memorandum to Commander Deichen on the atrocities of the Terrorist Party in massacring Serbians, with a list attached, containing the names of those who died in Croatia, especially in Bosnia, totaling 180,000. It has been found that the person in charge of this Terrorist Party is Pavelic, who is currently the leader of Croatia. In addition, 700 Serbians in the Galovac area were imprisoned in oxcarts, not allowed to go out, without food or water, for eight days. When the cart door was opened, hundreds of people in the cart had died.

Reuters, London, 12th - The Czech News Agency reported that Heydrich, the acting protector of Bohemia and Moravia, issued an order yesterday to dissolve famous patriotic organizations in various places and confiscate their property.

New German Weapon: Torpedo Planes

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th - After German newspapers published photos of torpedo planes a few days ago, the authorities officially announced yesterday that German troops are also using torpedo planes. Due to military concerns, details of the aircraft will not be released. However, it is said that this aircraft is a new weapon of the German army, and the effectiveness of German torpedo planes has been greatly improved recently.

### The Great Burma Road: China's Lifeline

— Zhou Shuhua

Mr. Theodore H. White, a Far East correspondent for the American magazine Time, recently returned to the United States from Chongqing, China. He recorded in detail the information he obtained in China, which was published in its entirety in the September issue of Fortune magazine. The following is an introduction to what he wrote about the Burma Road.

The outcome of a war depends more on economics than on military might. And the maintenance of economic strength depends entirely on the acquisition of materials. The acquisition of materials depends on transportation lines. This is why the Burma Road is attracting worldwide attention. — Shuhua Notes: If Japan does not invade by land, it will never be able to render the Burma Road ineffective. And it is not necessarily possible for the Japanese to advance by land. — Said Mr. Glarthy, American Special Economic Investigator for the Far East (see yesterday's newspaper)

Equivalent to British Ships

Although the transport efficiency of the Burma Road is greatly reduced during the five months of the rainy season, it is simply the lifeline of free China, except for the road to the Soviet Union. Now that Germany and Russia are at war, Soviet supplies are becoming scarce. All of China's necessities, except for food, bullets, and rifles, must rely on this route. The importance of the tonnage transported on the Burma Road to China is as important as the various figures of British ship losses, aircraft production, and food supply to Britain itself.

From Lashio to Kunming, the crow flies only three hundred and sixty kilometers. The Douglas planes of China National Aviation Corporation take only two hours. But Chinese trucks have to travel seven hundred and twenty-six kilometers on the road. This road is the most difficult to drive in the world. The unevenness and roughness of the ground are unimaginable.

Truck drivers have to spend a week and a half on this road driving with intense concentration. The daytime is extremely boring, and the mosquitoes are rampant at night. Half of the season is torrential rain, and visibility is blocked. Half of the season is dusty, and the carburetors on the trucks are constantly damaged. As for the cold wind, fever, and the high cost of hostel rent, those are minor matters.

Long ago, Asian merchants knew that the shortest route from China to India and Europe was through the mountains of Yunnan, and not the 3,000-mile waterway around the Strait of Malacca. The current Burma Road follows the same route that silk merchants took in the Middle Ages. But the goods transported now are not like the raw silk, jade, gold leaf, amber, and ivory of Marco Polo's time. Forty years ago, old people in Yunnan still remembered seeing elephants carrying tributes from Burma to the Golden Luan Hall in Beijing.

Obviously, any country would find it extremely difficult to build this road; China was unprepared and lacked experience, and it seemed impossible.

Yunnan Province is a sloping land from northwest to southeast, from the Tibetan Plateau to the plains of Vietnam. From the northern plateau—like the fingers of a giant's palm—many mountain ranges run north-south through the province. And among these mountains are some of the deepest valleys in the world, near the jungle-covered Mekong River and the emerald-colored Salween River. The trees on the slopes and plateaus have long been cut down, so the summer rains pour down torrentially, and the dry winter is dusty. Moreover, Yunnan Province is sparsely populated and does not realize what benefits this road has for them. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, there were only 180 cars, buses, and trucks in the entire province of Yunnan.

Great Road Construction Project

There are two routes to follow for the Burma Road. One is shorter and the other is longer. The longer one can be connected to the 263-mile provincial highway that has already been built. This provincial highway was built by the one-eyed General Long Yunzhong a long time ago. It runs west from Kunming across the central plateau to Xiaguan. The new road turns southwest to the Mekong River basin, crosses the river, and goes south, further west across the Salween River. Within a distance of forty miles, its altitude varies greatly. It drops sharply from 7,200 feet to 2,500 feet and then rises to 7,500 feet. After passing through several peaks, it reaches the dense forests of Burma—all the way to Lashio. The construction of everything was the responsibility of the Yunnan Provincial Government. The central government subsidized 2 million yuan for the expenses.

Construction began in October of the 26th year of the Republic (only two months after the decision to build). Strong men from all villages were conscripted to work. Each district was assigned a distance to build and the number of workers. This is China's most transcendent construction method! The sweat and blood of manual labor are used in large quantities. This is how the Great Wall was built 2,100 years ago. An American engineer said this when inspecting the road administration: "My God! They dug open the mountain peaks with their own fingers."

On the Burmese side, the British also worked hard. They built from their territory to the Chinese border. There is no correct record of when the road was opened to traffic. But Ambassador Nelson and Captain Marsh did pass through this Burma Road in December of the 27th year of the Republic.

In sixteen months, 200,000 people excavated more than 2,000 trenches on top of the Malayan mountain range and built more than 300 bridges, including two suspension bridges hundreds of feet above the mountain gorge. This 720-mile highway is about 12 to 16 feet wide. The mountain road is rugged and difficult to travel. It is one of the most malaria-stricken areas in the world. It is also the most beautiful, most dangerous, most complex, and most important road in the world.

Countries around the world have believed in the importance of the Burma Road, but in China, everyone knows that it is not actually that important. Southwest Transportation Company and other government agencies have thousands of trucks running on that road. Although they have to stop for a few days during the snowy period, it does transport a lot of military supplies to the interior of China. But in the 28th and early 29th years of the Republic, most of China's imports still came from the Pacific coast, as they had been for a century. In November of the 28th year of the Republic, Nanning fell, and the important gasoline route was cut off. The transportation business of the Vietnam Railway increased greatly. The highest average monthly cargo record in the spring of the 29th year of the Republic was 13,000 tons. In June of the same year, the French army was defeated by Germany; under the threat of force, French Indochina compromised with Japan and closed the border crossing between Vietnam and Yunnan.

Suddenly, the Burma Road became China's only channel to the outside world. The Chinese recognized this reality and were greatly shocked. They rushed to transport goods to Rangoon in order to make extensive use of the Burma Road. On July 18 of the 29th year of the Republic, Britain, out of concern for its own crisis, compromised with Japan and closed the road for three months. During these three months, China was very tightly blockaded. In October of the same year, the world situation changed, and Britain had the ability to defend against the German blitzkrieg. American policy was also tougher. Therefore, on October 18 of the same year, the Burma Road was reopened. China's Minister of Foreign Affairs personally flew from Chongqing to preside over the opening ceremony.

Before the reopening, various agencies in Chongqing were planning: "What if the Burma Road reopens?" They wondered what the first batch of goods should be. But in the weeks after the reopening, they were disappointed because an average of only 5,000 to 6,000 tons of cargo was transported to Kunming per month from November to January. And it is currently China's only channel. Indeed, Japanese planes from French bases bombed from time to time, at least the Mekong Bridge was bombed twice, and the Salween Bridge was bombed once. However, in Chongqing, which is accustomed to air raids, it always felt that this could not be the reason for the poor transportation.

Improved New Posture

The Burma Road used to be used as an ordinary commercial highway, but it should be changed into a military supply line. Second, three-quarters of the trucks purchased by the government are not suitable. What China needs are large trucks with heavy carrying capacity and large cylinders, such as Mack and White vehicles. There is also the lack of unified administration. The Ministry of Transportation, the Yunnan Provincial Government, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Southwest Transportation Company (the government's transportation agency) all have the power to advise on the maintenance and repair of the road, and other smaller bureaus and agencies also want to get involved in the road administration, so there cannot be a certain, independent agency to take on the entire responsibility.

The most important point is the lack of drivers. Most of the truck drivers in various agencies came from Shanghai and Singapore. At first, many people volunteered to come to Burma out of patriotism. However, after they came, they immediately felt the high cost of living and the low wages, and there were constant rumors of administrative officials engaging in embezzlement and corruption. They rebelled, trying to siphon gasoline and resell it to private freight drivers. They learned how to save gasoline in order to sell it privately. They began to carry private goods and passengers. They invented many wartime slang terms in China. They called passengers "yellow fish," siphoned gasoline "white wine," private goods "pidgin cargo," and all other illegal income "sweet sugar." Most of the drivers had a monthly salary of 80 yuan in national currency. But they could find ways to earn an extra 1,200 to 1,500 yuan in national currency—more than the official salary of a government minister! They earned it easily, and they spent it especially quickly. The drivers ate and drank all night, patronized prostitutes, and gambled. The next morning, they drove with drowsy eyes and trembling fingers. Therefore, since the opening of this highway, more than 1,300 trucks have been damaged due to collisions with mountain rocks or overturning into valleys!

The freight on the Burma Road is very expensive. According to Western experts, the freight from Lashio to Kunming costs at least 2,754 yuan in national currency per ton. In addition, goods are easily affected by the rugged roads and the threat of Japanese aircraft.

In February of this year, Dr. Curley (an American economic expert) visited Chongqing before the future of this Burma Road took a turn for the better. Dr. Curley strongly advocated turning this road into an absolute military road, with everything ruled by military orders. He had the authority of the Lend-Lease Act to support his statements. Therefore, the Chinese government temporarily appointed Commissioner Ke as the responsible person. Baker is an American relief commissioner with rich transportation experience. Dr. Curley also expressed his approval, so Baker alone was in charge of the overall situation, and he was later appointed as the director of the entire road. In addition, a Burma Road Committee was established. It has five members; the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Transportation, the Southwest Transportation Company, and the Burmese government all sent representatives. The chairman of the committee is General Yu Feipeng. Baker exercised his powers in Yunnan and was the acting chairman of the committee. When Baker went to Yunnan to take over in May of this year, all aspects of the work had been urged very urgently. It is estimated that 10,000 tons of cargo were transported in April. After Baker took charge, optimists believed that at least 15,000 tons could be transported even in the rainy month of June.

Baker and Yu worked together in harmony and were very effective. In July of this year, American freight experts came to China, and with their help, Baker was able to reform everything about the road administration.

The most important issue is the truck drivers. The drivers are indeed good people by nature. They came to do this most dangerous job in Asia voluntarily out of patriotism. They go in and out of gunfire, and are constantly threatened by malaria and danger. If ordinary people were in their place, they would easily be frightened into neurotic patients within a few weeks. If we can give the drivers better treatment, they will surely be able to work in an orderly manner.

If we want to turn this Burma Road into a military route, there are many things that need to be reformed. The drivers' treatment must be improved, and their daily lives must be strictly managed by the military. The transportation and inspection of goods must be strictly in accordance with the management methods of modern railways. The road surface must be greatly repaired. Now the United States has shipped 10,000 tons of asphalt to China, which will definitely help the road's transportation efficiency. At the same time, air defense equipment must be strictly adjusted.

The Chinese hope to be able to transport 20,000 tons of cargo per month in the fall; if there are more trucks, 30,000 tons can be transported per month. Even so, this number is still pitifully small, so the Chinese are now planning to open air routes, new railways, and highways.

The importance of the Burma Road is not only related to Asia, but also has a great impact on the entire world!

### The Future of the World Lies in the Balance: British Shipping Power

— Chen Baorong

The Future of Britain Depends on Ships

What most people pay attention to in the World War may be the transport capacity of British ships, right? If too many British ships are destroyed by German submarines, then the sustainability of Britain's war against Germany will become a problem. This problem can completely change the world.

Britain's isolation in the sea, the connection with the autonomous territories, and the possibility of supplying the island with materials, all fates are in the hands of those merchant fleets and fleets. If foreign transportation cannot be maintained, then the war industry in England will collapse completely, and the entire population of Britain will starve to death completely. Today's British war against Germany will become a historical relic.

Therefore, the maintenance of maritime transportation is the foundation of Britain's nation, and the emphasis on Germany's submarine policy is the main strategy to attack Britain.

British Merchant Fleet

Thirty Million Tons

Before the war, the British shipping industry was under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Commerce. Now, in the European war, the previous method is cited, and a special Ministry of Shipping is set up to handle it. On the one hand, the transfer of ship ownership is strictly prohibited, and on the other hand, the requisition system is promoted. The requisition policy was first applied to ocean-going ships, and then to ships on near-sea routes and coastal routes. The requisition method is to transfer the ships to the Ministry of Shipping for use, and the Ministry of Shipping gives the shipowners the actual amount of freight received, plus interest of 5%. If it is sunk, the government will compensate at the original price, and the government will offset it with the insurance premium income. With the increase in war risk insurance, freight has greatly increased. Ship workers' wages have also increased by 83% compared to before the war. Wartime insurance premiums have increased from 8% per year to 28%. Freight price lists have been suspended from publication. Taking the freight of neutral countries as an example, it has increased by 113% last year compared to the previous year.

Before the war, the total tonnage of ships owned by Britain was about 21 million tons. Later, 7 million tons of enemy ships such as German and Italian ships were captured, 800,000 tons were purchased from the United States, and 1.5 million to 2 million tons of new ships were built by Britain during the war. The total is 30.3 million tons to 38 million tons. According to the British government, the number of ships lost since the start of the war is far more than 7.16 million tons, so the number of ships that Britain can currently control is still about 30 million tons.

According to the situation during the last war, the ships lost by Britain during the entire war period were 7.76 million tons, equivalent to about one-third of the total tonnage at the beginning of the war. At that time, 5 million tons of new ships were built, so the total tonnage at the end of the war was only about 2 million tons less than before the war. Now Britain must have a shipbuilding capacity equal to one-fifth of the lost ships in order to maintain its strength without decline.

Lose One Ship, Replace Three

In his famous speech at the end of May this year, US President Roosevelt mentioned Britain's current manufacturing capacity, saying, "For every ship that Britain loses due to German attacks, Britain's shipbuilding industry has the ability to replace more than three." According to experts, the current British shipbuilding industry can complete 200,000 tons of new ships per month. Although this number seems to be less than what the US president pointed out, the strength of Britain's ship replenishment ability is not a problem.

In fact, to estimate Britain's shipping strength, the United States must be counted at the same time. The US maritime freedom policy is a guarantee that the shipping strength of Britain and the United States are two in one.

American Shipbuilding: An Amazing Plan

The United States has a huge merchant fleet and even greater shipbuilding capabilities. Taking the figures released by the US Naval Committee as an example: as of April 1 of this year, there were a total of 1,192 merchant ships with a deadweight of more than 1,000 tons, totaling 7,040,000 tons. Adding 24 new ships in April, May, and June, totaling 199,000 tons, there are 1,216 ships, totaling 7,059,900 tons. On June 14 of this year, the Naval Committee released another merchant ship construction plan, planning to build 705 new ships, totaling 9,750,000 tons, before 1943. The cost is 1.635 billion US dollars. On July 11, President Roosevelt again used 1.24665 billion US dollars to build 560 more merchant ships, totaling 5.5 million tons, by 1943. In this way, from 1942 to 1943, the United States can complete two new ships every day.

Therefore: the problem is not in Britain's shipping power, but in Germany's submarine power.

Hong Kong Exchange Rate Converted into Hong Kong Dollars Checklist

Inspection method: The bold numbers in the first row of the table below are the number of legal tender yuan, and the first row on the left is the exchange rate fraction. The remainder is the number of Hong Kong dollars that can be obtained for every 100 yuan of legal tender. For example, if today's Shanghai exchange rate is 4.60 and 3/8, first search for the bold number 4.60, and then search for 3/8. The intersection of these two numbers is 21.71553, which means that 100 yuan of legal tender is equivalent to 1.71553 Hong Kong dollars.

### American and Indian Cotton Cloth Both Fell

The New York cotton market was slightly loosened, because of the lack of important buyers, coupled with the good weather and beneficial crops, and the southern gang was selling sets, so the market was depressed. As a result, both futures and spot prices fell by four to ten pound coins compared to the previous day. The current price of Middling cotton is one cent and seven and a half US dollars, equivalent to a market load of three hundred and seventy-five yuan and two jiao and five fen.

The Indian cotton market first fell due to speculation, and then rebounded slightly due to purchases by European exporters and professional brokers. Then, it fell again due to long positions closing. At the 5:30 electricity price, it fell by 4 rupees to 6 rupees 25. The Brock price was 208 rupees, and the white load was 175 yuan and four jiao and a half. The predicted price for today's opening is that each will continue to fall by one rupee.

### Western Dried Mussels Rebound, Domestic Dried Mussels Get Better

Western dried mussels have recently seen a rebound in the market because of the scarcity of sources and the gradual depletion of bottom inventory. The dried mussels on the market are now selling for 265 yuan, and the large dried mussels are 300 yuan. The outbound dried mussels are out of stock. The remaining domestic Ningzi dried mussels are also doing well, with a price of 800 yuan, three or four tribute dried mussels are 850 yuan, and East dried mussels are 650 yuan.

### Kaiping Coal is Clearly Set and Secretly Tight

Although the arrival of Kaiping bituminous coal is very prosperous, the company only supplies contract customers and fellow traders, so the remaining amount is limited, and high-end goods are soaring step by step, and the dark market is also inevitably rising. Although a batch was released by a certain firm yesterday, it was only at a price of 500 yuan, but it must be purchased with Mentougou white coal to be obtained. The difference between the two sides must also be a 590 yuan disk. It is clear that it is set and secretly tight, and it is difficult to loosen.

### Matches Get Another Fifty Yuan Better

The market situation of daily necessities is that the exchange rate is shrinking, and the factory's distribution of goods is intermittent. People's hearts in all directions are extremely prosperous, and hoarding is common. The price of Beautiful brand matches has risen to 1,280 yuan per box, and Phoenix brand is 1,240 yuan, which is 50 yuan higher than the previous day.

Foreign candles have been weak for a long time, but because of the rising prices of various items, the purchase price has also risen, with Whiteley's Sailing Ship brand at 37 yuan and 8 jiao per box.

### Cigarettes Re-Rise

The cigarette market situation is that the factory's distribution of goods is not prosperous, and the foreign exchange is tightening. Floating hoarding households are holding up, causing the price to soar. Yesterday, the market opened and rose by more than 30 yuan, and the transaction was quite prosperous. The price of the British brand is 2,370 yuan per box, the Old Knife brand is 2,040 yuan, the Pinhai brand is 1,600 yuan, the Wuhua brand is 1,240 yuan, the Little Fairy is 1,470 yuan, and the small box of ten branches of Great Beautiful is 1,200 yuan.

### South Pacific Crisis Unabated, Britain and the United States Maintain a Firm Stance

British troops engage in extensive activities in the Middle East, while Germany eagerly anticipates changes in the Far East

Professor Rope-che of the University of Sydney Observes the War Situation

The "Sin-Wen Pao" yesterday reprinted an article from the "Sydney Morning Herald" of Australia, titled "Japan Has Encountered a Severe Crisis in the Pacific." The author is Professor Rope-che of History at the University of Sydney. The gist of the original article is that the development of the situation in the Pacific has now surpassed the German-Soviet war. Judging from the current situation, if Japan takes further action, the current war could expand into a world war, and even avoiding war would be impossible.

Current Situation in Thailand Faces Interference

Japan has undoubtedly advanced into Vietnam and continues to concentrate troops on the Thai border, pressuring the Bangkok government. As a result, Thailand has made economic concessions, and Thai banks have provided various conveniences to Japanese citizens. However, Tokyo is still vehemently attacking it. Therefore, Britain and the United States immediately issued warnings to Japan. Although diplomatic language was used, the motives were very obvious. British Foreign Secretary Eden reported in the House of Commons that the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, had informed the Japanese government that the British authorities were considering interfering in the Thai issue. He also stated that if there were any threats to the security of Thailand, Britain would pay close attention, especially regarding the security of Singapore. U.S. Secretary of State Hull also stated that Japan's actions in Thailand threatened U.S. interests in the Pacific.

Preparations Are Underway for Substantial Assistance

The aforementioned remarks have already explained the attitudes of Britain and the United States. The common goal is to impress upon Japan that if Japanese troops cross the Thai border by one step, Britain and the United States will immediately assist Thailand. It would be a mistake for Japan to think that Britain and the United States have not yet reached a stage of war, or that Britain and the United States have not yet achieved cooperation in politics. Ishii once said that Japanese troops must take various measures until the Japanese base in Cambodia is completed. Although Thailand has strengthened its border defenses, as a small country fighting against a powerful nation, it is vulnerable. Therefore, if British and American aid to Thailand is limited to material assistance, it may not be of much help.

European and Asian Situations Are Intertwined

The situation in Southeast Asia can no longer be said to be unrelated to the situation in Europe. Japan has clearly stated its opposition to the United States transporting oil to Vladivostok to supply the Soviet Union, and has concentrated troops on the Soviet border, echoing Germany from afar. Germany also hopes that changes will occur in the Pacific situation, so that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will have no time to attend to Europe. After Germany's plan for a quick victory over the Soviet Union failed, it intends to pressure Japan to contain Britain and the United States. In the past week, Germany's attack on the Soviet Union has made no military progress. The German army, which used to pride itself on blitzkriegs and repeated victories, has now suffered its heaviest blow.

Germany Deeply Fears British Counteroffensive Regarding the current situation, Germany is fearing a British counteroffensive. The scope of British air force activities has expanded, and the number of bombs dropped on German territory has increased threefold. British actions in the Mediterranean are also becoming more active. According to Attlee's report, in the middle of last month, the enemy lost 168,000 tons of ships in the Mediterranean. The British air force's bombing range has reached Crete and Dodecanese. According to Eden's report, Britain's strength in the Middle East has also greatly increased, and the situation there is now under British control. Therefore, Germany has recently stepped up its pressure on the Vichy government, demanding that it provide Germany with African bases and troops to increase its aggressive position in the Pacific and Mediterranean military aspects. Currently, in addition to using the slogan of granting freedom to the people of the Middle East, Germany has no other way to deal with Britain in diplomatic terms. With Germany in such a state of bewilderment, Japan's position in the Pacific will become more difficult.

White Russians in Shanghai Support Their Motherland

The "Sin-Wen Pao" reports that White Russians who have fled to Shanghai now feel the crisis of their motherland being ravaged by the Nazis. White Russians lost their homes due to differences in political opinions. Currently, those residing in Shanghai have almost completely devoted themselves to various tasks to help their country. Only a dozen or so White Russian refugees in this city believe that the war launched by Hitler and his followers may benefit them. However, this type of White Russian is decreasing daily, and it is believed that they will no longer exist in Shanghai in the near future.

### U.S. Defense Day

Major General Glassford Presides

Inspected the Defense Forces in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday

Major General Glassford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet, went to the headquarters of the U.S. Shanghai 4th Marine Regiment at 9:00 a.m. on the 11th of this month to inspect the U.S. defense forces in Shanghai. After shaking hands with Colonel Howard, the regiment commander, as a courtesy, he left. Also, the 27th of this month is U.S. Navy Day. The U.S. naval authorities in Shanghai will celebrate it at that time because the U.S. Navy Department has changed it to "Defense Day." As the flames of war are about to approach the Western Hemisphere, the United States has risen up to expand its navy and defend its territory. Therefore, the commemoration is even more meaningful. Major General Glassford and Brigadier General Dodd will preside over the commemorative ceremony. All U.S. naval personnel in Shanghai will celebrate as much as possible.

### Japanese Bury Underground Cables in the Central District, Connecting Hongkou

The "Sin-Wen Pao" reports that the work of the Japanese side burying cables directly connecting the Hongkou area is currently underway. The work of laying underground cables from the Shanghai Telegraph Office of the Ministry of Communications at 70 Fuzhou Road to the International Wireless Radio Station on Renji Road, and then from there to Hongkou, began last week. The cement steps on the sidewalk west of the Bund have been removed, and Japanese supervisors are burying cables underneath. Currently, the work at the Sassoon House International Wireless Radio Station has been completed. In addition, there are two other locations where work is being carried out simultaneously, one on Renji Road, along the Bund. The final destination is still unknown. However, according to observers, yellow lines have been drawn on the road surface of Waibaidu Bridge, and construction is planned for that area.

### Noodle Industry Demands Sale of Cheap Flour, Petitioning Today

The Noodle Industry Association will send representatives to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession at 1:00 p.m. today to petition, requesting them to inform the Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills to purchase large quantities of foreign wheat and operate at full capacity to increase the current market inventory and allocate large sums of money to directly purchase foreign flour and transport it to Shanghai for sale at a low price, in accordance with the method of selling cheap foreign rice. The text of their petition is copied below: A petition requesting the purchase of foreign wheat and the allocation of funds to purchase foreign flour to relieve the people's food needs. After the supply of cheap flour was stopped, the price of flour soared, exceeding three times the price of rice. The authorities stipulated that cheap rice was 110 yuan per stone, while flour was raised to 38 yuan per bag. The price of flour exceeds the price of rice, and the livelihoods of ordinary people are becoming more difficult. Please use your connections to inform manufacturers to purchase foreign wheat and operate at full capacity to maintain the supply of cheap flour. At the same time, please allocate funds to purchase foreign flour in accordance with the method of supplying cheap foreign rice and supply cheap flour to avoid speculation by merchants who manipulate and monopolize the market and deliberately raise prices.

### Captain Best of Java Company Arrives in Shanghai for Sightseeing, Believed to Be Related to Adjusting Shipping Routes

Captain Best of the Java Mail Steamship Company has arrived in Shanghai from Java by Dutch ship to inspect the situation in Shanghai. However, it is widely believed that Best's arrival is because the Dutch ships traveling between the South Seas and Shanghai need to be adjusted, or that he has a mission. Currently, only three ships of the Java Mail Steamship Company are sailing to Shanghai after the war: Zibad-Zizhahanija and Zizhadanini, etc., averaging twice a month. It is also rumored that due to Dutch-Japanese negotiations, there may be a suspension of sailings to Shanghai.

### Rice Shops in Hongkou and Western Shanghai Districts Begin Selling at Low Prices Today

Entrusted by the Food Rice Public Warehouse Management Committee, the Rice Shop Industry Association began registering "receiving and selling public warehouse rice" for fellow rice shop operators on the 3rd of this month. The two concessions began selling at retail prices as scheduled on the 11th. As for the rice shops in the Hongkou and Western Shanghai districts, due to the approaching memorial day and Sunday holiday, they were unable to pay and deliver goods as scheduled. It is understood that the sale will be postponed until today. As for the Rice Shop Industry Association, it is still continuing to process the "receiving and selling warehouse rice registration."

### Car Owners Seek Fuel-Saving Methods, Black Market Emerges

Yesterday, it was learned from gasoline merchants in this city that after the three major gasoline companies in this city implemented the fuel allocation permit system at the end of last month, car owners have been seeking gasoline in the black market because the amount of fuel approved by the fuel company authorities is too small to meet their needs, resulting in the price of gasoline in the black market being much higher per gallon than the price set by the fuel companies. At the same time, many car owners in this city have not yet obtained fuel allocation permits from the gasoline companies, resulting in a large number of applications for fuel allocation permits. However, each fuel company must determine the amount of fuel it approves to supply based on the source of gasoline. It is also learned that the yellow gasoline sold by the Mobil gasoline company is colorless gasoline with added dye, which has no effect when used in cars but cannot be used in airplanes.

### National History Museum Collects Recent Historical Materials

The National History Museum of the National Government, in order to commemorate the achievements of martyred heroes and make their deeds immortal and a model for future generations, to show the country's utmost care, has specially launched a campaign to collect historical materials related to the military and construction since the military rise, which can be used as examples and warnings, directly or indirectly related to the war of resistance and construction, and to collect them separately, in order to preserve them for a long time.

### Anshun Ship Suffers Accident in Xiamen, Losses Exceed Two Million

The Anshun ship of Jardine Matheson arrived in Xiamen from Shanghai on the 1st and docked at the Jardine Matheson Wharf. After unloading the goods for Xiamen the next day, it loaded goods such as ghost money and measuring instruments from Xiamen to Hong Kong and the South Seas. At about 8:00, a dock worker sitting idly in the cargo hold smoked and accidentally threw the cigarette butt on the paper. Two hours later, thick smoke rose from the vent, and then a fire broke out, triggering a fire alarm. More than 100 passengers on board who had traveled from Shanghai to Hong Kong were panicked and moved their luggage onto the dock to take refuge, causing great chaos. At that time, the flames filled the sky and the river was red. Fortunately, the fire brigade arrived and extinguished the fire at 11:00. However, all the goods in the warehouse were destroyed. It was found that the destroyed goods included ghost money and bamboo wares loaded from Xiamen, as well as cloths and cotton yarn carried from Shanghai to other ports, totaling more than two million yuan in losses. Because there was a lot of water in the hold, the ship sailed to the seventh wharf to unload the sewage. It returned to the Jardine Matheson Wharf at 5:00 p.m. on the 3rd and started sailing to Hong Kong on the 5th.

### Electricity Coal Arrives in Port

It is understood that coal merchants can obtain legal foreign exchange by purchasing coal, so it is easier for coal merchants to purchase goods from overseas production areas than in the past. Yesterday, according to news obtained, from the 1st to the 10th of this month, coal totaling more than 10,000 tons has been traded. Yesterday, according to news from the shipping industry, the cargo ship "The Patrina Nava" (Sapo Senahua), managed by Jardine Matheson, arrived in Shanghai directly from the Sandellbourne region yesterday morning, carrying 4,268 tons of coal. The coal was all ordered by the Shanghai Electric Power Company.

### Municipal Council Issues Another Announcement, Preventing Terrorist Activities

Informing Leads to a Reward of 5,000 Dollars, Search Efforts Intensified

The "Continental Daily News" reports that the Municipal Council issued an announcement yesterday (the 11th) to prevent the occurrence of terrorist incidents, stating that anyone who informs and leads to the capture of terrorists will be rewarded with 5,000 dollars. According to the Municipal Council's announcement on July 19, 1938, a reward of 5,000 yuan was offered for reporting terrorists and those carrying military weapons. This announcement is a reiteration of the previous proposal. In addition, the police department has dispatched plainclothes detectives to intensify search efforts and monitor well-known terrorists. Many people have been summoned for questioning by various police stations. In order to eliminate evil forces within the concession, the gambling squad, which had suspended operations for several months, has resumed operations. Several locations have been searched, gambling equipment seized, and many gamblers arrested. All locations suspected of running gambling dens are being closely monitored.

### Mail Ship Valrtriki Sinks in the Atlantic

Mail to London from Shanghai is also Lost, National Day Commemorative Stamps are Sold Out

According to the notification from the U.S. Post Office obtained by the Shanghai Postal Administration, the mail ship Valrtriki, carrying a large number of mail items from Shanghai to London via New York in the United States, was attacked and sunk en route from New York to London.

The mail items sent to London from Shanghai were also sunk. As for the exact number of mail items, the Shanghai Post Office is still investigating. If the mail items sent by Shanghai merchants are damaged due to the sinking, the Shanghai Post Office will individually notify the senders after receiving the notification. Also, according to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, a U.S. mail ship arrived in Shanghai directly from the United States on the 11th of this month. The ship is managed by the American President Lines and does not have a fixed sailing schedule. It carried 889 bags of mail items to Shanghai, which have been sorted and sent by the post office to

each recipient yesterday. For the National Day Commemoration Day, the Shanghai Post Office was ordered to print commemorative stamps for the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. The stamps have denominations of one cent, two cents, four cents, eight cents, one dime, one dime six cents, two dimes one cent, two dimes eight cents, three dimes, and one yuan, totaling two yuan and two dimes for the whole set. But as soon as they were issued, stamp collectors in Shanghai rushed to collect them, and the general public considered purchasing commemorative stamps to be even more meaningful in this year of victory and the great National Day, resulting in

all the commemorative stamps

being sold out by yesterday. The Shanghai Postal Administration and its branches have all sold out and have no more in stock. Latercomers are unable to purchase them, and although some have tried to find someone to buy them on their behalf, it is in vain. It is reported that the total amount of stamps issued this time was 190,000 yuan (or 190,000 sets). As of the 11th, all post offices in Shanghai have none left.

### Cart Transporting Soybean Rice and Drawing Small Carts, Designated Freight Areas

After the Shanghai Soybean Rice Transportation Association was approved and established by the Municipal Council, it has begun to handle transportation matters. Due to rising prices, the original transportation costs are insufficient to maintain, and the gasoline restrictions have had an even greater impact. Therefore, the board of directors resolved a few days ago to request an increase in transportation costs from the Grain Rice Industry and Rice Shop Industry associations to maintain operations. It has been agreed to implement this starting from the 15th. For the convenience of calculation, the areas are designated as follows: (1) Central District, (A) British Concession from the Bund to Hart Road, including the Huisi Police Station area; (B) French Concession, from the Bund to Ladu Road, south to Xujiahui, 6.5 jiao per bag; (2) Western District, (A) British Concession, Hart Road west to Caojiadu, Bailinan Road, and Yidingsheng Road 7.5 jiao, Yidingpan Road west to Zhaofeng Garden 8.5 jiao; (B) French Concession, Ladu Road west to Yaozhu Jiao Road 7.5 jiao, Yaozhu Jiao Road to Xujiahui Town and Fahua Town 8.9 jiao; (3) Eastern District, Waibaidu Bridge east to Tilanzhao and west to Bazilu 6.8 jiao, Tilanzhao to Lanlu 7.8 jiao, Lanlu to Shenjiatan 8.8 jiao; (4) Special Distant Area, those outside the above-mentioned area will be charged according to the distance, starting from the 15th, all trucks, rubber-wheeled small carts will be charged according to the above prices.

### Children's Welfare Association Raises Funds for Orphans' Education and Upbringing, Appeals to All Sectors to Donate Generously

The Shanghai China Children's Welfare Association has launched its annual fundraising campaign for the education and upbringing of orphans on October 10th, with a target of 100,000 yuan. The association hopes that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will continue their past spirit and donate generously to meet this urgent need. The following is a copy of the fundraising letter from the association's executive committee members Li Denghui, Luo Yunyan, etc. to people from all walks of life: Dear Sir/Madam, Our association has been established for more than ten years and has been able to continue to promote its work thanks to the support of people from all walks of life and various public organizations. However, since the outbreak of the war, the scope has expanded and the work has become more tense. In addition to the original children's education and upbringing院, which has taken in more than 140 children, we have also established two shelters for orphans and infants, which have taken in more than 450 orphans. The number of orphans has increased sharply, and the expenses have increased accordingly. In addition, prices have risen sharply in recent years. Not only rice and cinnamon are expensive, but even small daily necessities are several times more expensive. We are overwhelmed and weak, and it is difficult to maintain without calling on the assistance of generous people. We have always admired your compassion and care for children, and we are especially grateful for your enthusiasm. We dare to ask for your generous assistance, your charitable donations, and to widely raise funds, so that the more the better, which is a public virtue with no bounds.

### Autumn Grass and His Paintings Xia Min

Shanghai, this place that faces the fires of the world and takes pride in itself, for four years, under the smiling false prosperity, everything has been disguised into an unusual appearance. Speaking of art, it seems that a garden of flowers has been opened in a bustling manner. Art exhibitions are naturally lively, not only are visitors shoulder to shoulder, but also many people order works. This seems to be a kind of progress, and at the same time, it has aroused the interest of general painters in their own work. My old friend Chen Qiucao is inevitably one of them.

Regarding Qiucao, I don't want to presumptuously introduce him as a famous painter. As far as I know, he rarely participates in other group exhibitions, and he is not very enthusiastic about socializing with his peers. He looks like he is aloof, but in fact, he is full of enthusiasm. This enthusiasm is broad, he gives sincere concern to friends, to the crowd, to society. He founded the Painting Institute and the cram school, the former was destroyed in the January 28 Incident, and the latter was temporarily closed due to the impact of the August 13th Incident. But these do not shake his confidence in art, and he has been silently painting for several years.

He is a Western painter, his paintings are vigorous and solid, do not cater to vulgarity, and do not flaunt schools. In the past ten years, he has also studied Chinese painting. He is fond of the charm, bone method, and brushwork of Chinese painting, etc., but he also has the attempt to promote the original ink and wash interest and to incorporate new consciousness and content. He loves the artistic conception of Chinese painting and poetry, and pays more attention to the active view of each theme, as well as the concept of entering the world rather than leaving the world. He loves the rigorous, simple, simple, and unpretentious style of the ancients, but he uses its techniques with a cautious attitude and expands it in a lively way. He can use various techniques to paint, but he does not confine himself to the category of techniques. It is also not impossible to write something that caters to the general public, but he values works of the soul. Therefore, some works are taken from a wide range of perspectives and are spontaneous, not just some so-called works of pottery and pleasure. In fact, a modern writer, who is in such a turbulent era, it would be a great loss if he spent all day fantasizing about himself or teaching people to yearn for how to return to the life of the ancients. Despite this, he still respects his contemporary writers. He never belittles people. Although he usually does not participate in other group exhibitions, he is very enthusiastic about visiting other people's exhibition works. He told me about the trip to visit the Second National Art Exhibition, rushing back and forth in one day by express train. He humbly studies the strengths of each writer, and is never satisfied with himself, which is his advantage.

October 13th to 19th is the date of his second solo exhibition. The location is in the Daxin Company Art Hall, with only a hundred points on display. The main part is recent works of Chinese painting. But they contain a strong lyrical atmosphere, and the titles are also gentle and readable. The evaluation of his art is left to the appraisers to say. I never criticize painters' paintings, but they are common. Qiucao can go his own way with a practical spirit, which is worthy of sympathy. So I want to say that this is an exhibition that stems from ordinary motives, but does not entirely contain ordinary content. I hope it has more and greater gains than paintings.

### After Shen Jinshu was Shot, His Injury Worsens

Shen Jinshu, a native of the city, who is the 99th detective and acting deputy inspector of the Criminal Department of the French Police Department (also known as the Robbery Squad), was shot at 8:45 a.m. (new time) on the 11th while taking a No. 17 unlicensed car at the intersection of Caishi Road and Lafayette Road. He was sent to Guangci Hospital and immediately underwent surgery by Dr. Shangte (transliteration), the chief French doctor of the hospital. All the details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now reported that Shen's injury is extremely serious. Although he was able to speak and was conscious yesterday morning, the doctor informed the nurses that he refused to allow his relatives and friends to visit and talk because Shen's injury was still dangerous. Starting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, he suddenly became short of breath.

### Living Hell on Earth Bai Min

Hundreds of international sailors trapped in Shanghai are mingling with prostitutes and criminals, allowing drugs and alcohol to destroy their lives. …A man in front of me, as pale as a corpse, vomited from excessive drinking, fell to the ground, and no one paid attention to him. After a few seconds, the man raised his head, crawled to the door, and sat down with his head hanging down. …A Russian as thin as a skeleton lightly bumped into the reporter and asked, "Want a woman?" …Walking into a small room, there were six scantily clad women sitting inside. …The room was dimly lit, and a woman was sitting on a bed in the corner, smoking white powder on a piece of tin foil. …This scene is no different from hell on earth.

Continental Daily News reporter Eskrum, after patrolling the Nanshi, went to the "drug district" in Hongkou to inspect and wrote an article about it, which is translated below.

Entering Hongkou from the Waibaidu Bridge and walking for a few minutes, passing the Lunda Road浜, is the human hell where evil is rampant; hundreds of international sailors trapped in Shanghai are mixing with prostitutes and criminals, allowing drugs and alcohol to destroy their lives.

The drug district occupies three or four side streets. Drug dens, brothels, and low-class bars are everywhere. White powder is openly sold, without any taboo. The obscene scene there is unbearable for a sober person. The reporter has patrolled the low-end dissipation areas in many ports such as Port Said, Marseille, and Saint-Pierre, but has never seen the rampant evil in the Hongkou district so blatantly.

The reporter encountered no less than six Russians and Chinese who were smoking white powder on the night he patrolled this drug district. He also saw teenagers in their teens smoking this deadly drug, and he also saw people who were drunk and vomiting, lying on the dirty sidewalks. When the reporter arrived in this area, the first thing he saw was a narrow alley, crowded with hundreds of half-naked prostitutes and bare-armed men of various nationalities. Sharp dance music was constantly coming out, mixed with the drunken shouts of men and the giggling laughter of women, making a mess (to be continued)

### Zhang Ruogu Handed Over to the Japanese Again

Mr. Zhang Ruogu, deputy editor of the supplement of the American-owned China-U.S. Daily, was arrested by the Japanese with the French police on Lafayette Road last month and handed over to the Japanese. As a result of the negotiations between the American legal counsel of the China-U.S. Daily and the French, he was handed back to the French police for detention. It is now learned that Mr. Zhang was again handed over to the Japanese at 6:00 p.m. last Saturday (the 11th).

### Twelfth Academic Lecture Jiang Zhensheng to Speak

Titled "Talking about Life from a Biological Point of View"

Yesterday was the twelfth lecture of the academic lecture series, held at the Xuan Palace. Biology expert Professor Jiang Zhensheng was invited to speak on the topic of "Talking about Life from a Biological Point of View." Excerpts are recorded as follows:

(1) Introduction

A (Explanation of Life) What is life? This is a serious and interesting question. Let me first explain that life is a certain stage in the development of matter. This kind of matter has undergone a long stage of inorganic, organic, and complex biochemical changes. It can be said to be the sum of organic functions, which is the continuous adjustment of internal and external relations.

B (Methods of Solving Life) Modern natural science firmly refutes various theories about the arbitrary generation of life and the universal spiritualization of matter, such as the ancients regarding temperature, breathing, and pulse as the functions of spirits. The vitalists claimed that there is a kind of potential behind life, so the theory of the soul arose. There are also agnostics who say that life cannot be known by human power. Lametrie wrote and published "Man-Machine," so there was the claim of mechanists, who said that life is a passive machine without subjective and active practical power. Therefore, we must avoid this view now and explain life from the facts of biological evolution. (To be continued)

### Scholarship Charity Basketball Game Lanbai Continues to Battle Paramount

First battle scheduled to begin this Saturday Still adopts the best-of-three series to determine the championship

The scholarship charity basketball tournament hosted by the Paramount Sports Association of this city, the three games between Shanghai Star and Paramount, have been completed one after another. Both sides won one game each and drew one game, sharing the limelight equally. The nature of the tournament was originally charitable, so victory or defeat was not important. Therefore, the organizers have announced the end of the tournament, temporarily bringing a major stage to a close. At the same time, they are stepping up preparations for another major battle between Lanbai and Paramount. On the Lanbai side, since winning the disaster relief charity championship last month, there were rumors that it was about to disintegrate. It is now learned that this statement is completely inaccurate. Yesterday, Lanbai decided and expressed their sincere intention to continue participating in the charity match. At the same time, the game schedule has also been discussed and finalized. The game will still adopt the best-of-three system. If any side wins two consecutive times, the third game will still be held as usual. Now, the first game is scheduled to begin this Saturday (18th), the second battle is scheduled to continue on the 22nd (Wednesday), and the official announcement will be on the 25th (Saturday). The tickets for each game are still divided into two types: 10 yuan honor seats and 3 yuan ordinary tickets. After being sent to accountant Xu Yongzuo for signature and stamp today, pre-collection will begin tomorrow. The organizers also plan to invite the film star and actress teams to participate in the performance, and have contacted both sides. At that time, they also plan to invite famous male and female actors and male and female red stars to participate in the opening ball and award ceremony. Everything is already in the planning and invitation stage.

### Long Team Announces Dissolution Chinese Federation Football League Also Suspended

The Long Team mini-soccer team, led by Mr. Wang Ruilong, chairman of the Ruilong Sports Association, has now announced its dissolution. According to Mr. Wang, his transportation business has been busier recently than before, and he no longer has time to manage the team's affairs. In addition, he will spend less time in Shanghai and more time in other places in the future, so he has to temporarily suspend the Long Team. Even the recently initiated Chinese Football League, although it has been largely finalized, it seems a pity to give up. But due to concerns about not being able to attend to everything, he has to abandon it. Fortunately, there is no shortage of enthusiastic sports people in Shanghai, who will be able to continue to run it.

### One of the Elements of a Happy Family Couples Should Avoid Quarrels

— Yi

British novelist H.G. Wells, author of "The Outline of History," said, "A wife who is used to scolding often says endless unimportant things, but a quiet wife, even if she doesn't speak, can represent everything."

Indeed, in various families, large and small, we can often hear couples arguing endlessly and debating incessantly. In fact, the things they are arguing about are not worth making a fuss over.

At the beginning of married life, couples should each find ways to correct themselves and adapt to the environment. They must sacrifice the selfish mentality they have developed since childhood in order to create a happy family life.

If the time that couples around the world spend quarreling is accumulated and used for useful work, there will definitely be considerable achievements.

### Science Creates a "Comfortable Home"

— Yang Chunlv

History tells us that humans lived in caves and wilderness in primitive times. Youchao taught people to build nests with wood, and the Yellow Emperor built palaces, houses, utensils, and tools. This was a major evolution in human life. Even compared to the residences of two or three hundred years ago, today's residences have significant improvements everywhere. From the construction materials to the interior decorations and wooden furniture, there has been considerable progress. This progress is directly or indirectly due to science.

Because of the various discoveries and creations in science, human families have gradually improved, and life has become more comfortable and pleasant. Without the creation of bricks, tiles, and cement, modern high-rise buildings could not be built. Before the invention of paints and glass, the gloomy darkness of the room was conceivable.

The creation of various other utensils has indeed made mankind gradually reach a state of happiness and well-being. The old fire pits and stoves have been improved into new-style heating designs. The coal-smoked torches have been replaced by bright and clean electric lights. The method of making fire has evolved from preserving fire to the widespread use of matches. Glass mirrors have changed from luxury goods to necessities. Clocks and thermos bottles are almost indispensable items in every family. Gramophones and wireless radios, entertainment appliances, are also becoming increasingly popular.

In short, in the family, due to scientific inventions and creations, the house is bright and has become a lovely residence. But we must never be satisfied with this and must continue to attack science to make future families more progressive and more comfortable.

My Family Problems

### Announcement of Essay Contest Winners 2 A Disappointed Husband

— Yisheng

My wife has received secondary education and is usually taciturn. In recent years, under the pressure of life, she has rarely smiled. After careful observation, the economic difficulties are certainly the first point, but the biggest problem is her inability to trust me.

I am a doctor and my business is quite busy. The past family life was still satisfactory, because our marriage originally had a lofty ideal, and both hearts hoped for future happiness. However, the facts of the past few years have proved that we have completely failed. My wife's confidence has gradually shaken and eventually shattered. Many times, she has confided in me: "Yisheng, when will our happy life begin?"

"We are still creating it! Jenny, probably in the near future..." I can only answer like this.

However, this answer obviously cannot satisfy her desires. She only sees me busy from morning to night, and the price I get is not enough to hire an old nanny to help her cook. So she became negative; when she became too negative to resolve herself, she became tyrannical. Her face changed from a smile to calmness, from calmness to ridicule. The joy of family warmth in the past has long become a dream of the past. How painful this should be for me! Every day, what I come into contact with during the day are sick faces and sad eyebrows, moans and sighs; what I encounter in the evening are contempt and resentment. I have simply completely lost the joy of life. Several times, although I have also expressed to her that my ambition is not dead and that my career is promising, for a disheartened person, these many words are only enough to increase her hatred.

After a long exploration, I realized that the key to this problem is that the couple has lost their mutual trust. Of course, my own failure also has to bear part of the responsibility. A woman's expectations of her husband are often too high, because her own huge desires must be matched with her husband's superior conditions to be satisfied. But when she feels disappointed in reality, her gentle love and faith also disappear without a trace. Not to mention the impact on the children, the blow to the other party is also big enough.

But how can mutual trust be maintained? I believe that this is not only a personal family problem, but also a problem that should be solved universally in society. I deeply wish there was a way to save me and also save people who are suffering from the same disease as me. (This article is worth 10 yuan in national currency and 12 issues of Family Monthly for the whole year)

The pain of a husband who does not gain his wife's trust and is even despised by his wife is conceivable. However, Mr. Yisheng said that his business is quite busy. I don't know why there are still so many difficulties. Is it because the expenses are too high or there is another reason? Mr. Yisheng also did not explain what his original lofty ideal was.

If this ideal is reasonable and truly hopeful of being realized, Mr. Yisheng must not waver in his original plan because of the current change in his wife's attitude. It is difficult for a person to get sympathy from others before he succeeds. His own wife is naturally no exception. Mr. Yisheng seems to be able to explain the difficult situation to his wife. What can't a couple talk about? In case Mr. Yisheng's ideal is to live in a foreign house and drive a car, then Mr. Yisheng should also be responsible for half of the current uneasy environment. I pray to God that the fact is not like this.

Mr. Yisheng is a doctor and relieves people of physical pain, which is very good. However, in addition to the physical body, humans also have to take care of the spirit. Many people are physically painful, but mentally happy. Why doesn't Mr. Yisheng study whether he has disappointed his wife in the spiritual aspect?

Poverty cannot prevent a person from achieving success. The Austrian musical genius Mozart (1756-1791) was very poor during his lifetime, and his wife was not good at managing the family, but their spirits were happy. One cold day, they didn't have money to buy firewood and couldn't start a fire, so they danced in the house to keep each other's body temperature. This is a story worth telling.

Next issue's essay contest announcement: My Problem with Remarriage

### A Week's Home Cooking Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Living in Shanghai is not easy, and eating is unaffordable! Chicken, duck, fish, and meat are indeed prohibitively expensive. Even eating vegetables is somewhat overwhelming. Just imagine, a pound of spinach or a pound of greens costs forty or fifty cents. Before the war, you could buy two pounds of meat for that price. After much calculation, only onions are the cheapest, costing about ten cents a pound. You can get three or four large ones, or nine or six small ones. Although they cannot stand alone, they are very useful as supporting ingredients. Stir-fried beef strips are indispensable without them. Even stir-fried pork strips, stir-fried eggs, stir-fried chicken giblets, and duck giblets are worth trying. If you think they are too monotonous, you can add some tofu vermicelli and braise them together. The taste is endless. Readers may wish to try it.

Spring and Autumn

### Facing Reality

— Wei San

In his address to the military and civilians of the country on National Day, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek offered very sincere exhortations to intellectuals, mainly stating that the intellectuals and social leaders of the country must face reality squarely, understand the nature of the Chinese revolution, shoulder the great responsibility of the rise and fall of the world, and advocate that compatriots devote themselves to production and focus on science to lay the foundation for national defense and enrich the economy, overcome all difficulties and dangers, and establish a guarantee of victory.

We carefully study the above admonition, and I humbly believe that everything should start with the four words "face reality squarely," because reality is an urgent matter at hand that cannot be ignored, nor can it be ignored. The so-called "facing reality squarely" means that we must have a very accurate understanding of reality and not distort it. The intellectual community and social leaders have their own environments and work, and they should face reality squarely and seek accurate understanding from their respective environments and work.

After facing reality squarely, it is especially important to grasp reality and work hard without the slightest relaxation. In other words, we should uphold the spirit of self-improvement and respond to urgent work, cut down the thorns everywhere. Time is constantly moving, and reality is constantly changing. If we cannot grasp reality, we will inevitably feel a sense of fleeting time and regret that it is too late.

Therefore, facing reality squarely is especially important to grasping reality; grasping reality is even more important to facing reality squarely.

### How to Resolve Disputes Over Water and Electricity Bills?

— Bao Di

-A Practical Formula-

Living in this era is truly exasperating. Today, rice prices rise, tomorrow, coal prices rise, and the day after tomorrow, oil prices rise again. We live under the threat of rising prices all year round, without a moment of peace. What is especially annoying is the water and electricity bills. In our not-so-big neighborhood, the sub-landlord and the sub-tenants have to argue for a long time almost every month over the water and electricity bills. What is the result? Many are resolved satisfactorily, but not a few turn hostile and even fight.

First of all, we must recognize the real cause of the dispute. That is, of course, because the water and electricity companies have increased their prices. Therefore, the fundamental solution to the dispute is to stop unjustifiable price increases. Historically, the reasons given by water and electricity companies for price increases have been "to maintain a normal profit margin." In fact, public utilities are fundamentally a business that prioritizes serving the public over making profits. It is already strange enough that they constantly talk about profits, profits, and profits. It is worthwhile for us to pay attention to whether the profit figures published by the company over the years are accurate. Some corrupt organizations only need to treat "capital expenditures" as "revenue expenditures" or artificially increase the "depreciation rate" of fixed assets to hide part of the profits and make the book profit lower than the real profit. Now, I think the business structure of the water company should be reasonable, and it seems unlikely that the above situation will occur. Therefore, it is also most reasonable for us citizens to kindly request the concession authorities to appoint an accountant to audit the company's accounts. This benefits both the authorities and us, and can resolve a sense of estrangement. Secondly, since the company has increased prices, then the increased amount should naturally be shared by everyone. However, rent is usually paid at the beginning of the month, but the increased amount of water and electricity bills is not known until the following month. Then, how should the amount to be added to the rent be determined? For this reason, the landlord argues for adding more, and the tenant argues for adding less, often arguing endlessly. In fact, estimating the amount to be added is not an impossible task. Its calculation formula is as follows:

Average Monthly Total Increase = Average Monthly Water (or Electricity) Consumption × (New Unit Price - Old Unit Price)

Why should the average monthly water (or electricity) consumption be used in the formula? Because the water and electricity bills included in the rent are not the actual amount of water and electricity bills for the current month, but the average amount of water and electricity bills for the whole year. Because factors such as the length of days and the hot and cold weather will affect the amount of water or electricity consumption. Just as we take out life insurance, assuming that we take out life insurance from the age of thirty to the age of sixty for thirty years, and the annual premium is ten yuan, this does not mean that the premium at the age of thirty is the same as the premium at the age of sixty. It is only because we want to make the annual premium equal that we collect more premium in advance in the first few years to offset the insufficient amount in the last few years.

Let's illustrate it with an example. For example, the original price of water in the French Concession was 32 cents per unit, and it increased to 34 cents per unit this month. The average monthly water consumption of a certain shared residence is 100 units. Then, its calculation formula is as follows:

Average Monthly Total Increase in Water Bill for the Entire House = 100 × (0.34-0.32) = $2.00

Based on this number, it is then divided proportionally among all residents.

Editor's Note: It should also be emphasized here that it is "proportional." The amount of water and electricity used by each tenant is not the same. Especially for those who rent a room, some families use more lights, or turn on the radio, which is different from other families. Therefore, tenants should also average it out proportionally. And the sub-landlord must also participate in the apportionment. - The sub-landlord sometimes uses even more than the sub-tenants, why should the sub-tenants let him "enjoy himself"?

### So Energetic for Life: Shipping Tiger

— Yong

Are you unfamiliar with the term "shipping tiger"? This is a type of freelance profession that involves going to foreign ocean-going ships to sell goods.

"Shipping Tiger" is just a general term. When analyzed, it can be divided into several industries. Such as beer vendors, suit tailors, Beijing goods merchants… They each go to the ship to do their own business, without a system or organization.

Many Styles

Among them, the so-called Beijing goods shipping tiger carries goods such as underwear, socks, blankets, thermos bottles, toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, perfume… and all daily necessities. It's like a department store, with many styles, too many to list.

Mining for Gold

What needs to be stated here is, what kind of ship do they go to? The goal is the foreign merchant ships moored in the waters around Yangshupu. As soon as the customs posts a schedule of foreign ships arriving in port, the shipping tigers hire sampans and rush to gather around the buoys, waiting for the treasure to arrive. They climb onto the giant ships and set up temporary stalls in the gaps on the deck. The bow and stern of the ship suddenly resemble the scene in front of Jing'an Temple on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month. Animals one by one, emitting sharp gazes, have to work hard to survive and wait for good business.

Several Languages

The nationalities of foreign merchant ships are extremely complex. The languages spoken by the crew members on the ship also vary depending on their nationality. Therefore, for business reasons, the shipping tigers have to learn a few sentences of various languages. Whether it is English, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, or even the garbled language of black people, they can respond in a pidgin style. If you want us to write a few foreign words or read a foreign article, that's not showing off, please find someone else.

Golden Age

Two or three years ago, it was the golden age of shipping tigers. At that time, foreign exchange soared, and news on the ship was relatively slow. Therefore, if the transaction was valued in foreign currency, the profits would be even more substantial. It was not uncommon to earn hundreds in a day of hard work. Moreover, before the outbreak of the European war, an average of one or two merchant ships from various countries arrived in port every day. Making money was a sure thing, like catching a turtle in a jar.

Prostitution and Gambling

In theory, the shipping tigers could save some cash to prepare for occasional needs in times of famine. However, the reality is quite different. Each has his own hobbies, prostituting, clinking glasses, playing with guide girls, playing mahjong, fighting dig flowers, playing poker, gambling on pai gow… they do everything, and they are all not smart! "Come from the water, go into the soup." Those who can take care of their future lives and save a little are one in a hundred!

Precarious Livelihood

The outbreak of the European war gave us a fatal blow! Merchant ships from countries such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy, France, and Norway have gradually stopped sailing east. Currently, only a few American ships are still coming and going. But it is rare for them to arrive, and it is like seeing a treasure. A large group of merchants swarms onto a ship, but the result is often "birds seeing chaff"! They even lose money on sampans, food, and other expenses!

Thirteen: Wandering to Shanghai

Meibao worked hard and helped Xiaogouzi cook a large pot of millet porridge and a cage of big steamed buns made of corn flour, and brought them out to entertain their distinguished guests.

"I'm really sorry, we'll pay together tomorrow!" said a middle-aged man with the rank of platoon leader very gently.

"What's the matter? You soldiers are fighting the enemy to protect our people. Can't you receive some respect from us?" Meibao said with a smile on her face.

These armed comrades heard Meibao speak very elegantly, knowing that she had received education, so they scrambled to talk to her. Qiu Haitang loved her only daughter, so of course he did not stop her. Moreover, at the same time, he himself also wanted to know some real information, so he readily joined them in discussing everything under the sun.

According to Platoon Leader Lu's explanation, the Chinese army's combat is not weaker than others? It's just that others have been preparing for it for a long time, and they have prepared everything in advance. Secondly, others have artillery and airplanes, so resistance is more difficult.

"Dezhou may not be able to hold on, it seems we have to wait until we cross the Yellow River!" He said without concealment.

"Then why do we have to fight them?" Qiu Haitang blurted out.

"We don't want to fight at all! They won't let us go, they will definitely fight us to the end. What else can we do except resist?" Platoon Leader Lu said very painfully, and finally separated his hands, making a painful expression.

After this question and answer, everyone fell silent at the same time. (234)
