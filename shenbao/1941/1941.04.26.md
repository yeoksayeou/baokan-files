Adjusting Economic Institutions to Give Japan the Final Blow

Hong Kong: According to a public statement from the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang in Shaoguan, the Chinese authorities, due to the favorable military situation, are now mobilizing economic forces to fight the final battle with the Japanese army. The ratio of the economic war to the military war is currently seven to three. General Li Hanshun, Chairman of Guangdong Province, has returned to Shaoguan from Chongqing with a detailed economic plan. Since the Japanese have suffered setbacks in the military field, they have intensified the blockade of Guangdong's coast. The main purpose of the above plan is to counter Japan's economic blockade. According to the plan, China must mobilize national human and material resources, readjust and reallocate them, reduce consumption, and implement economic controls. In this way, final victory can be ensured. Old economic concepts must be replaced by wartime needs, so that the economic structure can be adapted to national defense programs. In order to implement the new economic institutions as soon as possible, a centralized system will be adopted. All tax authorities, cooperatives, transportation agencies, customs agencies, and salt and grain production and sales agencies will be included in the new economic structure. Technology is also essential for war, so it is also being mobilized. Young people will receive technical training, and all national manpower will be organized and trained. Workers, farmers, and women should be treated in this way so that the movement to increase production can be realized. The new economic structure is under the scientific and military institutions. After this decision plan is implemented, important industries and enterprises will be controlled by the government or nationalized. Government control will be strengthened, and daily necessities will also be supplied by the government. The economic activities of the people, from production to consumption, should be controlled to meet military needs. As for the people themselves, they must be thrifty.

### Achievements of the Tuberculosis Prevention Movement

In the first Tuberculosis Prevention Movement, 20 hospitals participated in free X-ray examinations, all of which were private hospitals; 17 pharmacies also provided medicines at low prices; and 6 laboratories, including Zhu Yanggao and Cheng Muyi, provided free sputum testing. The spirit of private new medical and pharmaceutical enterprises emerging to serve the public deserves deep sympathy. The profession of a doctor is to treat diseases, and the highest task of a doctor is to guide the public to prevent diseases before they occur, so that they do not get sick. If the public can get minor illnesses, or at least fewer illnesses, then the contribution of doctors to the nation, country, and society is greatest. This is the origin of the Chinese saying that a good prime minister is also a good doctor.

Serving the public is extremely difficult, first because there are many people, second because there are many matters, third because the quality of the people is uneven, and fourth because it is easy to be misunderstood by the public. Therefore, if one is not careful, one must not only work hard but also endure complaints. The examination of pathological conditions is extremely difficult, such as X-ray examinations, which still have some symptoms and sources that cannot be fully understood by fluoroscopy. Moreover, the consultation is hurried and the time is short; sputum tests may not show results. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to expand the tuberculosis prevention movement, so that it can be eradicated before it occurs, treated when it has occurred, and recovered in the aftermath. Only then can it benefit the people and achieve significant results.

However, this is not entirely the responsibility of private medical and pharmaceutical industries, but also relies on the cooperation of the public. Today, the service spirit of hospitals with public properties is not satisfactory. They are preoccupied with comparing the costs of medical treatment and surgery, and have no time to take care of the urgency of the disease. This is not as beneficial to the poor and sick as the charitable medical care and medicine provided by the Buddhist Jingye Society, Renji Shantang, and Jishenghui for decades. Private enterprises, no matter how lofty their ideals and how courageous they are in serving the public, are ultimately limited by their manpower and financial resources, and cannot fully achieve their wishes. Observing that the tuberculosis prevention movement has been continuously promoted by the health departments of the concessions, it has left a deep impression on the public's mind of preventing epidemics. Even women and children know the fearfulness of a fly spreading the plague, which is a clear proof that the epidemic prevention has achieved results, and it is also a good example of governing with virtue rather than punishment. The so-called "government" is for the people, and the so-called "virtue" is the education of good intentions; punishment is used to discipline those who do not follow the teachings. If punishment is used before education, it is called punishing without teaching, which is the fault of the officials and cannot be blamed on the people. Therefore, spitting everywhere is originally a bad habit and a medium for the transmission of diseases, which should be eradicated. However, the way to eradicate it is not through punishment. Some people think that punishment can serve as a warning, and that without punishment, how can people be encouraged? This is not true either. Punishment can indeed serve as a warning, but knowing to avoid punishment without knowing that it should not be done, then if the punishment is relaxed, the old ways will return. Today, the government, whether it is national or municipal, should not only allow the people to be guided but also allow them to know. It is now the time when the people can be both guided and allowed to know. Therefore, the success of the tuberculosis prevention movement depends on widespread and effective publicity, so that the public can understand the harm that tuberculosis causes to themselves and others, and guide them to seek treatment and provide them with convenient medical treatment and medicine. If this is done, over time, even if tuberculosis cannot be eradicated, it can be reduced by a large margin. If punishing spitting is considered a way to eradicate old habits, it is not only easy to violate the prohibition, but the majority of ignorant rural people will be affected, which is disturbing the people, not nurturing them, and not what is called governing with virtue. Virtue is transformed through education, and when it is transformed, it penetrates the people, becomes a social custom, and then people will willingly follow the teachings without the need for punishment!

However, the tuberculosis prevention movement is a movement to strengthen the nation. Therefore, the most effective defense is to resist with one's own physical strength. The air contains an unknown number of germs, and an unknown number of germs enter the body with each breath. The world does not cause everyone to get tuberculosis, nor does it cause everyone to get sick. This is because those with strong resistance can resist germs invisibly, while those with weak resistance are invaded by germs. It can be seen that developing inherent resistance is the easiest and most effective way to prevent tuberculosis. If one waits until one is sick before seeking treatment, it is too late. Therefore, how to cultivate everyone's resistance is also a major issue that public health should pay attention to and guide.

Furthermore, manpower is the master of all undertakings, and funding is the mother. Tuberculosis is extremely easy to transmit, and people cannot leave society, so they cannot say that they are not worried about transmission. However, no social figures have been seen to support the tuberculosis prevention movement. If people do not seek support, then support will come from people. With funding, the development of the undertaking will be easier. What is now hoped for from the public is that they should not think of tuberculosis prevention as a matter for a few medical and pharmaceutical circles, but as a matter that is closely related to the masses. They should mobilize the manpower and financial resources of the masses to eliminate the tuberculosis that harms the people. Secondly, those who suffer from tuberculosis should cherish themselves and not transmit it to others, and should voluntarily isolate themselves from others. Thirdly, those who do not have tuberculosis should cherish themselves and not damage their own resistance, so that germs can easily invade. If this can be done, the tuberculosis prevention movement will be twice as effective with half the effort.

### Guo Taiqi States in the United States that China Will Surely Win; The United States Is a Decisive Factor in the World War; Freedom of Belief Will Eventually Triumph Over Power

New York: Guo Taiqi, the new Chinese Foreign Minister, met with American journalists at his residence this afternoon and stated that China's diplomatic policy has not changed and that it is determined to cooperate with friendly countries in accordance with the good neighbor policy. China is grateful for the United States' assistance to China. He personally believes that the United States' assistance to democratic countries will be a decisive factor in the world war. Guo also reaffirmed his belief that China will achieve final victory and believes that China's future difficulties are more economic than military. Although the Soviet Union and Japan have concluded an agreement, he personally believes that the Soviet Union will continue to aid China. Japan is currently deeply mired in China, so it hopes to withdraw its troops from China and advance south. However, Japan may not immediately launch a large-scale southward advance, but will wait for a certain result in the European war. He is extremely concerned about the attitude of the United States. Guo warned Japan that Japan is taking greater risks in the Pacific because Japan has always been defeated in that area and has gone on to worship war, believing that it can profit from war. To deal with Japan, he personally believes that the policy must be firm and sometimes even provocative. Regarding the various rumors about the so-called moderate faction in Japan, Guo believes that they are unreliable because Japan must be completely defeated before a social revolution can occur. Any worldwide organization after the war must have the active participation of the United States in order to succeed. Guo finally discussed the situation in Britain and said that although Britain's future has difficulties, its victory is not in question. The British people have great faith in Prime Minister Churchill's leadership. Although Britain has been bombed, its losses are relatively small, and the morale of the people is firm. Some people in Britain are currently carefully discussing the resolution of European issues after the air war, and their focus is on economics rather than territory and politics.

New York: The New Chinese Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi flew here from England this morning and plans to stay here for a while before returning to China to take up his new post. When Ambassador Guo arrived here today, those who welcomed him at the scene included representatives of the Mayor of New York and 200 people from the New York Chinese community. Hu Shi, the Ambassador to the United States, Tan Shaohua, the Minister to Brazil, Shi Zhaoying, the Consul General in Ottawa, Canada, and Cheng Tiangu, the Minister to Mexico, are said to have arrived in California and are currently on their way here. Li Dijun, the Minister to Cuba, is also on his way and plans to meet with Guo. After Guo got off the plane, he was surrounded by reporters and photographers from the newspaper. Guo made a statement saying that he had just come from a bombed city and was planning to go to another bombed city. This place is still a land of peace and happiness, and he very much wanted to rest here for a while. The scene of London under the bombardment was still ringing in his ears, and the heroic situation of the residents of London would be unforgettable for life. After staying here for a while, he planned to go to Chongqing, which was bombed by Japanese aircraft just like London, and its residents were just as heroic as those in London. The United States has always expressed sympathy for the people of China and Britain who are fighting for freedom. He now wants to tell the United States that the land with firm freedom of belief must also have the highest and greatest courage and the belief in freedom, and that it will eventually triumph over autocracy. This is what he firmly believes in. Britain has been fighting for a year and a half, and China has been fighting for almost four years. The reason why they fought so bravely was to defend the three major classics of mankind, namely the Magna Carta of England, the Declaration of Independence of the United States, and the Three Principles of the People of China. These three are the strongest links between China, Britain, and the United States. Li Shih-tseng also came with Guo and plans to return to Chongqing. (Dispatch of the 25th)

### One Week's War Situation, April 18th to 24th

In areas such as the Gongli area, the father launched so-called "blockade warfare" and "mopping-up operations" in the Qiantang Pujiang River area. If we carefully observe the various movements of the Japanese in recent months, we can see that their military distress has reached its extreme. They have no overall way to end the war, so they can only perform this kind of tactic intermittently, scene by scene, as a kind of decorative action during the combat period for the warring countries. We can still remember that in early March, the Japanese army, seeing the convenience of transportation and the smooth flow of materials in southern Guangdong, launched a so-called "blockade war" along 400 kilometers of the coast.

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Commission said that the Japanese military's movements this week seem to be tending towards aggression in the coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang. It was then learned that while southern Guangdong was blockaded, eastern Guangdong was open. So, they withdrew the troops from southern Guangdong and turned to blockade eastern Guangdong. However, since eastern Guangdong was blockaded while Fujian and Zhejiang were open, they then withdrew the troops from Guangdong and blockaded Fujian and Zhejiang. Now that Fujian and Zhejiang are blockaded, how can we know that southeastern Guangdong will not remain open? In short, our coastline is vast and the Japanese troops are limited. They are blocking here and flowing there, stretched thin, and only exhausting themselves in vain, incurring losses. Also, regarding the so-called "mopping-up operations," yesterday in western Hubei, today in northern Jiangxi, one day in northern Hubei, and today in eastern Zhejiang, these kinds of movements are enough to prove the Japanese army's lack of a solution. Therefore, it is not impossible to regard the war in Fujian and Zhejiang as their final struggle. A summary of the war situation of the past week is as follows:

Eastern Zhejiang

In the battle of the Pujiang River area, the Japanese continued to attack in three routes, starting to stir on the 16th. At about 5 p.m. that afternoon, several Japanese warships sailed from near Sanjiangkou north of Shaoxing, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, and forcibly landed. After our army's resistance, many were killed and wounded. Then, the Japanese added 3,000 more soldiers to invade southward. By the morning of the 17th, they invaded Shaoxing City, and then advanced towards Zhuji via Caigongbu, Fengqiao Town, and Diaowan. This was the left flank of the Japanese. On the same day, several thousand Japanese soldiers from Xiaoshan also launched attacks in separate groups. One group harassed Daluo Mountain, and one group attacked Kanshan Town. The main force advanced southwest to Yiqiao Town. By the 18th, more than 8,000 Japanese soldiers reinforced Yiqiao Town and continued to attack south along the railway line. They immediately engaged in a fierce battle with our army in the area near Yaogongbu north of Zhuji. Then, the Japanese again joined forces with the Japanese army that had come south from Shaoxing and launched a fierce attack on our Zhuji. After our army resisted in the Xindianwan area, repeatedly charging and killing, many Japanese soldiers were killed. Until the morning of the 20th, the Japanese again massively reinforced, with dozens of airplanes assisting in the battle. By noon, Zhuji City was invaded. Currently, our large army is resisting in the area south of Zhuji City. This is the movement of the Japanese central route. As for the Japanese right flank, they departed from Fuyang and also landed on Zhongshazhou by boat on the morning of the 16th. After entering Dayuan Town, they increased to more than 3,000 and advanced southeast to Dian Town. Then, on the 17th, they attacked Mao Tengshan, Yushan, and other places in separate groups. They were surrounded by our army, and the encirclement is currently being tightened.

The Japanese army landed in four locations along the coast: (1) Ningbo: On the morning of the 19th, a part of the Japanese army landed in Lishan, Jinji Mountain east of Zhenhai, and Nanhong west of Zhenhai. Zhenhai fell at 1 p.m., and then Ningbo fell. Our army then launched a fierce attack on the rear of the Japanese army, and Zhenhai was once recovered by our army. (2) Taizhou: The Japanese army also landed at Haimen on the 17th, Huangyan fell on the 20th, and Taizhou (Linhai) fell by night. (3) Wenzhou: The Japanese army also landed in separate groups in Shayuancheng, Rui'an on the 19th, and Yongjia (Wenzhou) fell at 4 p.m. on the 20th. (4) Fuzhou: The Japanese army also landed in separate groups in D'ao, Xiao'ao, and Nanzhang Port at the mouth of the Min River on the 19th. The Japanese army increased to more than 3,000. Lianjiang County fell at 4 p.m. on the same day. Another group increased to more than 2,000 and fell Changle at 6 p.m. on the same day. Another group of more than 1,000 landed in Changmen on the 21st and joined forces with the northern group to attack Fuzhou (Minhou). Fuzhou is located on the coast of the East China Sea, and its situation is prominent, making it difficult to defend. Our army withdrew from Minhou at 2 p.m. on the 22nd, leaving the Japanese army to attack an empty city, only feeling disappointed. In addition, in the battle of Dabie Mountain, the Japanese army has mostly retreated in defeat. There were no major battles in other battlefields, so they are omitted. (Telegraph of the 25th)

### Guaranteeing the Livelihood of Civil Servants: Rationing by Head

Chongqing: After the soaring of prices, those who are most affected are civil servants.

### Hull Delivers Speech, Says U.S. Will Strike Aggressors, Should Liaise with Other Countries for U.S. Security to Prevent Atlantic from Being Controlled

Washington: Secretary of State Hull declared yesterday that the United States must engage aggressors at the most suitable location for resistance, regardless of whether it is outside or inside the Western Hemisphere. In a speech at the American Society of International Law, Hull declared, "We are now in an extremely severe period. To think that we should not resist until aggression has invaded the borders of this Western Hemisphere is extremely short-sighted and extremely dangerous." Hull's speech came hours after he attended President Roosevelt's "War Cabinet" meeting. His speech was broadcast nationwide by various radio stations. Hull warned, "The remaining free nations should, at this time, do everything possible to expand their armaments and take self-protective actions in the shortest possible time. The facts have undoubtedly informed us that for the sake of the safety of this hemisphere and our country, we must resist at the most suitable location for resistance. This means that we must find ways to help Britain and other countries that are resisting dictators. Experience has shown that no country, regardless of its location, has any reason to expect to be spared the attack of aggressors." (United Press News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)

Washington: Last night, Secretary of State Hull delivered a broadcast, warning Americans not to be easily discouraged by minor temporary unfavorable news. He said that the failure of Britain and the acquisition and control of the ocean by invaders would pose a great danger to the security of the United States itself. If experience is to be believed, then almost no country in the world has the slightest reason to be spared from attack. Moreover, just as if a city is robbed by bandits, how can the richest residents of the city expect to be spared? The distance of the ocean may give us some time, but it cannot give us security. Therefore, security depends only on our strength and liaison with other peace-loving countries to prevent aggressors from achieving the goal of controlling the ocean. Hull emphasized the futility of any attempts at peace talks at present, because making peace with the Axis powers would be tantamount to falling into a trap. When they began their movement to conquer the world, they used the name of peace, causing many countries to be unaware of the truth and fall into their trap. Regarding the possibility that the United States' continued assistance to Britain and other countries might provoke some aggressors to attack us, it must be known that no aggressor country will attack because of our self-defense policy, nor will they refrain from attacking us because we attempt to reconcile with them. Our assistance to the various resistance countries is based on a firm understanding that every free country in any place is a fortress for all other free people. The heroic resistance of 40 million British people has turned the British Isles into a great armed base, from which a naval and air power is continuously produced. If the resistance countries lose control of the ocean, then the Atlantic will no longer be an obstacle to aggressors, but will become a channel for them to move westward. Our shield will be greatly reduced. Hull finally expressed his belief that freedom and justice will win the final victory. (Reuters News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)

U.S. Navy Secretary Knox Declares Must Fulfill Promise to Aid Britain

Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Hull and Navy Secretary Knox declared last night that the United States must find ways to ensure that U.S. aid goods reach their destinations. However, neither of them mentioned U.S. Navy escort. They were solemn and silent when they emerged from President Roosevelt's wartime cabinet meeting. In the hours that followed, they gave radio broadcasts. Although they did not mention escort, their firm wording showed that they believed the United States should now take action to ensure that aid goods reach their destinations. Knox, speaking at a New York newspaper publishers' banquet (Knox himself is also a publisher), reviewed the Nazi encirclement of the United States. He said that there is no longer any doubt about Germany's extravagant hope of dominating the world, and the Nazi jaws are closing. Knox also outlined the U.S. aid to Britain and condemned aggression. He said, "Things have come to this, we cannot retreat. We have dedicated ourselves to this decisive world struggle, we can only continue. We must have a beginning and an end. The United States must see clearly all possible consequences. If Britain fails, then the United States may be completely surrounded. At this point, our choices are only surrender and decisive battle. We will not surrender, we are determined to fight. All who know the United States will not doubt this. Therefore, if we do not find and implement a way for Britain to win without us fighting, then the result will be that we must fight." (United Press News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)

U.S. Naval and Air Patrols Expanded, Reaching Far into the Mid-Atlantic

Washington: Yesterday here, there were a series of rapid developments that foreshadow a historic decision to enable Roosevelt to fulfill his promise to send goods to Britain. However, there is no immediate indication that we will use escort. According to various indications, the situation in Britain has prompted the United States to approach a crucial move. The following developments have increased the impression that the United States will soon take action: (1) President Roosevelt convened his wartime cabinet for 90 minutes. It is believed that cabinet members discussed Britain's failure in the Balkans and ways to increase aid to Britain. (2) Congress learned that 40 percent of U.S. aid to Britain was sunk by Germany in the North Atlantic. (3) Alabama Democratic Congressman Mattlick declared in the House of Representatives that the U.S. Navy should now be considered to escort munitions to Britain. (4) The Congress reported that the government is currently studying plans to expand U.S. naval neutrality patrols to the mid-Atlantic, 300 miles from the U.S. naval outposts. New York Mayor La Guardia recently declared that Canada and the United States will defend the Atlantic to a distance of 1,000 miles from the North American coast. (United Press Telegraph of the 25th)

Washington: According to political and military figures here, although the British army was defeated again in Greece and suffered setbacks in North Africa, there is still hope for a final victory. Only if the scope of U.S. aid is greater than it is today, then even if Britain completely abandons the entire European continent and North Africa, its main force will still exist, and the fundamental situation will not change. However, this matter will be more lasting and more difficult to win. The U.S. authorities, in view of this situation, are trying to expand aid to Britain. The issue that needs to be resolved is whether the United States should send warships to protect ships transporting military supplies to Britain. It is not impossible to find a solution to this problem in the shortest possible time. According to news obtained by the New York Times correspondent in Washington, the United States is about to decide to adopt a "sea and air patrol" policy, that is, when ships transport military supplies to Britain, warships or airplanes will patrol several miles away, and if any suspicious airplanes or submarines are found, they will issue warnings so that the ships can change course in time to avoid danger. This disguised escort method will prevent the United States from being directly involved in the whirlpool of the European war. The inventor is said to be New York Mayor La Guardia. (Havas News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)

Chongqing: Well-informed Chinese sources, when commenting on the speeches of U.S. Secretary of State Hull and Navy Secretary Knox last night, expressed satisfaction. They told the United Press reporter that these remarks are particularly welcome at this time, because Japanese propaganda has shown that Japan hopes to reconcile with the United States and hinted that Britain and Japan are conducting negotiations in Tokyo to close the Yunnan-Burma Road. The Chinese side pointed out that the only way to deal with aggression is not to wait, but to take immediate action. The effective way to stop the aggression plan is to eliminate or destroy the aid to the aggressor. If it is too late, it will have no effect. (United Press News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)

### British Parliamentarians Urge Early Debate on the War Situation, Eager to Understand Three Current Issues, Advocate Forming a Small-Scale War Cabinet

London: The Reuters parliamentary correspondent said that the British Parliament all wants to formally debate the war situation as soon as possible. This point was already evident in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon. The three major questions currently in the minds of Congressmen are: (1) Did Eden's tour of the Balkans achieve everything within the greatest possible scope? (2) Does the government need new people? (3) Is production sufficient to cope with the war against strong enemy countries? Former Secretary of War Bally-Shaw led members to demand that Eden make a statement as soon as possible so that the House of Commons can form an opinion on the politics that led to the current situation in the Balkans. This debate will of course include the issue that is currently causing disturbance in Australia, but this debate will not be held until after the current situation in the Balkans has been clarified and when making a statement will not harm the military situation. Regarding production, parliamentarians are becoming increasingly skeptical of Labor Minister Bevin's continued opposition to "forced industrial mobilization." Parliamentarians also demanded the formation of a truly small-scale war cabinet with more straightforward authority to deal with various issues, and its members do not have to be selected from the current cabinet members. (Reuters News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)

Debate Date Not Yet Decided

London: Yesterday afternoon, a motion was put forward in the House of Commons to hold simultaneous debates on the war in the parliaments of various parts of the British Empire. When the Prime Minister announced the parliamentary procedure in the House of Commons but had not yet decided on the date of the debate, Conservative MP Winterton asked the Prime Minister to pay attention to the date of the debate in the Australian Parliament, saying that it would be unfortunate if news was released in the parliaments of other parts of the British Empire but was not released in London. Churchill replied that to say that Britain must hold a debate on the same day as Australia would be a novelty and, in a sense, infringe on the independent rights of the various dominions. However, scattered debates are obviously inconvenient. We are in close contact with the governments of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa to arrange these debates, and as far as possible, not to interfere with independent or individual actions. The Australian Parliament is unlikely to convene before the first week of May. (Reuters News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)

### British-Soviet Negotiations Have Made No Progress

London: Foreign Secretary Butler replied to a question from a member in the House of Commons yesterday that, regrettably, there has been no progress in negotiations with the Soviet Union on a trade treaty and a general settlement of affairs. The British government is always prepared to discuss issues of common concern with the Soviet government at the appropriate time, with the aim of resolving all pending cases in a way that is equally beneficial to both sides. The member asked whether the status of the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) was one of the causes of the difficulty. Butler replied, "I think this is something that may need to be discussed." (Reuters News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)

### New Australian Reinforcements Arrive in Singapore, Strengthening Malayan Defenses in Preparation for Accidents, Local Natural Barriers Are Not Reliable

Singapore: Today is the anniversary of the Australian army's participation in the European war. Australian troops in Singapore and Malaya held celebrations. Australian Army Commander Major General Pan Gangde sent a special telegram to the retiring president of the Australian Army Association yesterday to commemorate the occasion. The telegram stated that in the current vast battlefields, the Australian army still maintains the superior conditions of the Australian army in the last great war. We are now honored to be able to defend our country together with the Indian army, that is, Malaya. If a war breaks out in Malaya, we can assure you that today's Australian army will certainly maintain the honor of the Australian army in the last great war. (United Press Telegraph of the 25th)

Singapore: Yesterday afternoon, a large batch of reinforcements arrived here, so the Australian military in Malaya is now thicker. The Australian troops are all in high spirits. Those who arrived here in February have been sent to various parts of Malaya to engage in defense in preparation for the Far East War. When the new Australian troops arrived here yesterday, Far East Commander-in-Chief Park Fang led key naval, land, and air personnel to welcome them. The Australian soldiers gave the local workers who welcomed them at the dock Australian apples, cigarettes, and other items they brought. Malayan Australian Army Commander Major General Pennart published an article on Australian Day, stating the unity of the British Empire's troops, saying, "We are now in contact with British troops from India and the motherland. We would like to assure them of our friendship and trust. We feel that it is fortunate for us to be gathered in Malaya with them." (Reuters News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)

Singapore: The enhanced defenses of Singapore's fortresses are generally considered to have impenetrable tropical forests covering their rear (i.e., the east coast along the Malay Peninsula) as natural barriers, making it difficult for foreign enemies to invade. This statement is now unreliable. The British troops stationed in Malaya have proven that even in the densest forest areas, where the field of vision cannot extend beyond ten yards, it is not impossible to pass through. A certain Indian regimental commander recently conducted an experiment, selecting one of the deepest forests and using only a few soldiers, relying only on maps, compasses, and broadswords, and occupied a destination eight miles away within a few hours. The density of the forest is only dense in thickets of shrubs or small trees, and large trees are very sparse, so it is not difficult to cut out a path with a broadsword. After this lesson, the defense strategy of Malaya cannot but be reformed. Previously, there were two theories, one advocating defense and the other advocating offense, each insisting on its advantages. However, with reference to the experience of last year's French campaign, the British troops in Malaya must search for and destroy foreign enemies outside their own territory, and must not allow them to approach the new island, because Malaya's terrain cannot be used for trench warfare or positional warfare. Therefore, the main training of the British army at present is to make them a kind of assault force. (Taiwan Public Telegraph of the 25th)

### U.S. Troop Transport Ship Republic Departs Manila

Manila: The U.S. troop transport ship Republic, which arrived here three days ago with more than 1,000 soldiers, has now sailed out. Its destination is unknown. It is believed that this ship will go to Davao Port in the Philippines to load hemp. (Reuters News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)

### Indian Shipbuilding Program Progressing Very Satisfactorily

New Delhi: The Indian Navy's shipbuilding program is progressing very satisfactorily. Many minesweepers with strong power and excellent armaments have now been built. The shipbuilding program has recently been greatly expanded. (Reuters News Agency Telegraph of the 15th)

### Foreign Exchange Will Definitely Be Stabilized After the Sino-U.S. Agreement Is Signed

Chongqing: The Central Daily News reported that the Sino-U.S. Stabilization Fund Agreement may be signed today. The Chinese representative is Song Ziwen. According to a certain person in financial circles, the external exchange rate of the legal currency and its domestic purchasing power are not yet in line, but the government seems to be willing to maintain the current exchange rate. Therefore, it is expected that the foreign exchange market will be more stable after the Sino-U.S. Stabilization Fund Agreement is established. (Havas News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)

### British Army Fiercely Attacks Taishi, Italian Army's Resistance Becomes Spent Arrows, Flags of the Abyssinian King Flying Everywhere in Cities in the Gojjam Region

London: Nairobi released a public statement last night stating that British troops in Abyssinia were pressing against the outer defense line of the enemy army in the Taishi region. According to recent news, the enemy army is currently retreating, carrying out large-scale destruction to cover itself. The positions in the Nichiri region remain unchanged. To the west, British troops have occupied Maki, the center of the Merel tribe, and are very welcomed by the natives of the tribe. In other areas, patriotic Abyssinian troops are assisting in harassing the rearguard units of the enemy army and cutting off its transportation. Also, a message from Khartoum stated that the British mechanized patrol force advancing from Yemakar towards Amba Alachi, despite encountering artillery fire and road blockages, has made satisfactory progress. The Amba Alachi region saw fierce fighting during the Italian-Abyssinian War, and its natural defenses are strong, controlling the road to Taishi. The Italian garrison in Taishi is currently trying to stubbornly resist the attacking British army, and the only two places where the Italian army is currently resisting may be Taishi and Amba Alachi. Other areas are still quiet, with only patrols of British troops in the Asosa and Gambela regions frequently coming into contact with enemy troops. A Reuters correspondent telegraphed from the Taishi Road that most of the remnants of the Italian Governor of Abyssinia, Osta, have retreated to Taishi (140 miles northeast of Abyssinia), and are currently making a final stubborn resistance and building strong obstacles on the roads leading to Taishi, relying on the mountains. South African British troops launched an attack on Wednesday afternoon. The fierceness of the bloody battle was rare in the war in Abyssinia. The Italian army that was holding the obstacles there was finally defeated by the South African army, which captured many enemies and severely damaged the enemy army. The South African Air Force's new aircraft are fiercely attacking the Italian army that is fleeing through the mountain passes towards Taishi. The Italian army has blocked the roads, obviously wanting to take a breather. It is not yet clear whether the enemy intends to gather the remnants to resist again before reaching Taishi. Patriotic Abyssinian troops, in conjunction with the South African British troops, have cut off the road to the Eritrean port of A　Bait and are blocking the enemy army, preventing it from retreating into the Danakil Depression in the east. If the Italian army flees north along the road to Asmara, it will be severely attacked by the British army because General Platt's army is advancing south after occupying Keren. (Reuters News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)

London: According to news from Nairobi, the flag of Abyssinian King Selassie is now flying over the cities in the Gojjam region of Abyssinia. (Reuters News Agency Telegraph of the 15th)

Enemy aircraft concentrated at the Du-Na airfield were also attacked on Wednesday. The details of the damage are unknown. Enemy troops concentrated in various parts of Cyrenaica were strafed and bombed, suffering heavy damage. On the 22nd, British aircraft also attacked the port of Kaladu and the key port of Rhodes in the Italian Dodecanese Islands at night. Both were hit by bombs and exploded, causing large fires that burned fiercely. (Reuters News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)

Estimated Strength of Axis Forces

New York: A certain newspaper's military commentator said that according to previously undisclosed information, the Nazi country sent another mechanized division to Tripoli last week. It is estimated that the German side has two armored divisions and four motorized divisions in North Africa, in addition to anti-aircraft artillery units totaling between 85,000 and 90,000 people, while the remnants of the Italian army under Graziani still have almost 50,000 people. (Reuters Telegraph of the 25th)

### German Aircraft Continue to Attack British Ships; Germany Claims 52 British Planes Destroyed in 24 Hours

Berlin, According to authoritative sources on the Water Day, it is claimed that in the past twenty-four hours, the German Air Force shot down 52 enemy planes and sank 22,000 tons of enemy ships. 140 miles east of Dundee, a convoy was attacked by German planes, sinking five enemy ships (14,000 tons) and damaging another ship (4,000 tons). Near Thermia in Greece, one ship (6,000 tons) was sunk, and near Elefsis, one ship (4,000 tons) was severely damaged, with a violent explosion occurring after the ship was hit. Another ship (5,000 tons) sailing towards Corinth was hit by bombs. In the engagement between German and enemy aircraft, eight enemy planes were shot down. (Maritime Telegraph, 25th)

### A Sketch of Marshal Pétain's Life of Great Responsibility - Celebrating His Eighty-Fifth Birthday Yesterday - Old but Vigorous, Striving for the Renaissance of France

Vichy, Marshal Pétain, the French head of state who led the bloodless revolution in France to overthrow the Third Republic, celebrated his eighty-fifth birthday yesterday. This "great old man" who facilitated the rebirth of France has now entered his sixty-sixth year of service to France. At a time when most French people, even low-level workers with social insurance, retired twenty years ago, Marshal Pétain still bears the responsibility for the revival of France during the most unfortunate period in history. However, Pétain's health is quite good, and yesterday he still handled his routine affairs for eleven hours. According to Dr. Ménétrel, Pétain's personal physician, who spoke to a United Press reporter, Marshal Pétain's arteries and heart are still like those of a sixty-five-year-old. Although he is eighty-five years old, his physical condition is twenty years younger than his age. His body and functions show no signs of weakness. Pétain has an excellent appetite and sleeps a full eight hours. Such physical condition is rare; perhaps only one in a million can be found. Eighty-five years ago, on April 1, 1856, Marshal Pétain was born into a wealthy farmer's family in the village of Cauchy-à-la-Tour in the plains of Franche-Comté. Pétain's field is now managed by his younger brother, who is a few years younger than Pétain but equally healthy. In the fields near Pétain's land, the Germans have now set up long-range artillery, constantly bombarding the British coast, thirty miles across the water. However, the German occupation forces still respect the land of the French head of state. In the village of Cauchy-à-la-Tour, there are still a few farmers who know Pétain. These farmers were classmates with Pétain in the Cauchy village school before Pétain went to the Saint-Cyr Military Academy in Saint-Étienne, studying together on a long, hard bench. The young Pétain also played soldier games in the fields around the village, and his lifelong career was determined in this game. Three years ago, when Pétain was eighty-two years old, he had completed a long and courageous career of service to France. At that time, Daladier summoned him back to duty and appointed him as the first French ambassador to the new Spain of the Franco government in Burgos. Last year, when Pétain was eighty-four years old, former French Prime Minister Reynaud summoned Pétain back from Madrid on May 14 to discuss strategies for saving France and turning defeat into victory by his bedside. At that time, the armored divisions commanded by German General Guderian had broken into the French front lines and were heading straight for the coast. Pétain's reply was very simple and straightforward, saying, "At this time, there is no way to stop the enemy's advance; the only thing to do is to ask for an armistice as soon as possible." Unfortunately, when the German army was still north of the Somme, occupying only one-tenth of French territory, Pétain's words were not heeded. A month later, when the French army asked for an armistice, the Germans had already occupied three-fifths of French territory. At that time, the army collapsed, millions of people fled in droves, and the parliamentarian system of the Third Republic also rapidly disintegrated. Various politicians fled far away, either in the mountains or by sea, to avoid the approaching German army. Thus, Pétain took on a great responsibility, and in the critical situation in Bordeaux, a week before the armistice agreement was signed on June 16, Pétain broadcast to the public, saying that he had asked the Germans for the armistice that he had advocated a month before the overall situation changed. Pétain told the public, "I view France as a gift for myself. I now bitterly tell you that we must stop fighting. Everyone should stand by my side." Nine days later, Pétain declared again, "Our honor is still preserved. No one can use our fleet and aircraft. The government is still free. France will still be ruled by the French. I will never deceive you with lies. What I hate is the lies that have led to such pain." Six months after his eighty-fourth birthday, Pétain launched a bloodless revolution, dissolved the parliament and party politics on July 11, dissolved the Masonic lodges, and approved laws banning Jews. On October 11, Pétain again proposed an expanded peace to Hitler. Hitler accepted Pétain's proposal within two weeks, and they met in Montoire on October 30, forming an agreement to cooperate in building a European order after the war. Pétain, tirelessly, traveled to Clermont-Ferrand, Toulouse, Lyon, Marseille, and Toulon, and in mid-February, he went to Montpellier to meet with General Franco. Pétain's decision to meet with Franco was the first decision since leaving Madrid. Even with talented political strategists such as Laval and Flandin manipulating, Pétain still maintains his position as head of state and government leader. Pétain has established a national deliberative body with his personal strength. He has invigorated the French youth and has become a role model for the forty million French people in their efforts to revitalize themselves during difficult days. Even with the government burdened with heavy responsibilities, difficult negotiations with the Germans, the unfortunate situation of France being divided into two zones, and the disputes between French factions, the enthusiasm and vigor of the youth will still be maintained.

### Franco-German Reconciliation Negotiations Approaching

Vichy, French Associate Darlan left Paris this morning to return to Vichy, reporting on Franco-German reconciliation. After consulting with Head of State Marshal Pétain, he will return to Paris next week for detailed negotiations on Franco-German reconciliation. The cabinet was convened this afternoon to receive Darlan's report. It is understood here that the initial negotiations are general in nature, so Darlan did not bring any specific German demands or proposals. The details of such negotiations will be reached next week when General Darlan meets with German Ambassador Abetz in Paris. Detailed German plans may arrive in Paris on Monday or Tuesday. It is already clear here that Germany is willing to reconcile and is willing to offer considerable financial, economic, and moral benefits to encourage breaking the deadlock and reopening reconciliation negotiations.

Random Notes on the European War (47)

### The Complete Story of Willkie's Trip to England

Although his eyes showed fatigue, his attitude was still enthusiastic. During the half hour when his prepared speech was being copied, there was quite a stir in the visitors' gallery, but he was quietly talking to the senators near him about the war and this trip. Among the group of listeners were the wives of stubborn congressmen, arrogant Washington isolationists, committee members waiting to refute Willkie's testimony, and ordinary citizens patiently paying attention.

Three photographers climbed dangerously onto the roof beams forty feet above the ground to take pictures. At this time, discussions were mixed and voices were noisy. When the copied speech was distributed to the members of the committee, the audience calmed down. Willkie leaned on the table and calmly read the reasons for his conditional support of the Lend-Lease Act. He said, "Americans have two paths to take. The first path is that the United States should close itself off, consolidate its national defense, and make aggressors stay away. He believes that this path will destroy American freedom and ultimately lead to war—dictators will inevitably try to obstruct and sabotage it, forcing us to rise up and fight. The other path is to recognize not only the interrelationship between people but also the interrelationship between ideas and principles. The trade methods of totalitarian countries can only be avoided if a broad international free space exists. Therefore, helping Britain is not actually for Britain's sake but to jointly defend this free space with Britain."

When the government introduced the Lend-Lease Act, Americans were shocked because of its empty content. Willkie's statement, however, put forward various clear and specific proposals, which moved the listeners even more. When he suggested that the United States should supply Britain with five to ten destroyers per month and should abolish red tape to rush the construction of patrol bombers and merchant ships, the listeners were as if electrocuted. In order to achieve unity of public opinion, he called on the majority party in Congress to cooperate with the minority party to resolve all disputes. In this way, those who were

Willkie's view on the vast powers given to the president by British Home Secretary Morrison could be enlightened.

This defeated presidential candidate read his testimony for half an hour. The congressmen listened attentively, and one enthusiastic supporter could not help but applaud and praise him. Several of those who had previously opposed him also nodded frequently in approval. Committee Chairman George asked if any congressmen had any questions. Harrison did not, Connally did not, and Johnson, a seventy-four-year-old isolationist senator from California, also shook his head and said, "I have no questions."

It was Vandenberg's turn. This senator from Michigan was originally a stalwart isolationist but had recently inclined towards a pro-British policy. He cautiously asked, "Is this a policy of full support for Britain? Will this policy drag us into the vortex of war in order to enable Britain to hold on?"

Willkie replied, "In my judgment, only one body in the United States has the power to declare war. If I were a member of Congress, I would never vote to approve a declaration of war unless the whole country and the situation inclined towards the path of war. To comply with the will of the voters, I have no other way."

Willkie sat in his chair, calm, avoided misrepresentation, and never wavered. As a result, the tone of approval gradually strengthened, saying that he was a great man in the United States and a reliable leader.

Next was Senator Clark. He was ruddy-faced, sharp-tongued, and always unwilling to give in to others. At this time, he asked in a sharp voice, "Mr. Willkie, when you were touring England, did Britain hope that the United States would send ships to escort military equipment? Do you know anything about this?"

"I don't recall anyone expressing such a wish."

"Didn't you mention this matter?"

Willkie said, "That's right, I said it according to my heart. I have always been like this."

Clark then asked what would happen if Britain still failed even if it obtained American bombers. Willkie said, "If we supply Britain with bombers and can weaken Germany's strength, our position can be stronger compared to us keeping the bombers."

"Did you fly around half the earth to guide this committee?"

"I flew around half the earth, not to guide the committee or anyone. We need fairness..."

Clark, who has been a senator for many years, often started his speeches with "Mr. President." At this time, he forgot himself and faced Willkie, shouting as usual into the microphone, "Mr. President..."

The audience applauded loudly, and Clark blushed and stopped speaking immediately. Chairman George banged on the table to prohibit the noise and warned the audience not to make a fuss. After a while, he said kindly, "If you want to laugh, just laugh."

Clark continued to attack Willkie's campaign speeches, saying that Mr. Willkie had said that he could not comply with the president in diplomatic matters? Hadn't he said that it was useless and dangerous for the president to attack foreign countries?

"Of course, I said those words," Willkie protested. He didn't want to bring up old cases again. He did make some fierce remarks during the campaign. He didn't want to answer, but it wasn't because he was afraid, but because reopening the dispute would be useless. He also said, "I have tried my best to defeat Roosevelt. But he has been elected president for another term. He

Willkie's Statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the Reasons for Supporting Britain is now my president. But whenever I like, I can still disagree with him."

After the questioning was over, the audience surrounded Willkie. The police cleared a path to allow Willkie to avoid the crowd and go to Chairman George's office. The audience discussed again, some saying that this was a special expression of courage and sacrifice, and some saying that he would become one of the most successful of the defeated presidents.

Willkie has proved the legitimacy of this trip to England and his position. Twenty-one days ago, on a cold morning, an airplane carrying him departed from LaGuardia Airport. Who would have thought that there would be such significant results! Since he set foot on British soil, he has tirelessly inspected the islands. After returning, he won a victory in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Willkie's life has once again attracted the attention of the world.

Sir Frederick Bowhill, the "King" of British aircraft manufacturing, said to a friend in London, "I had dinner with the next president of the United States last week." Was it Willkie?

Meng Lu's Talk

Dr. Meng Lu, an old professor at Teachers College, Columbia University, recently came to Hong Kong to attend the annual meeting of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture. According to him, there are currently a total of 26 Chinese students interning in automobile manufacturing engineering at the three major automobile factories in the United States, "Ford," "General Motors," and "Chrysler," all of whom are subsidized by the Foundation. Their internship period ranges from six months to one and a half years. After graduation, their universities will award them degrees, and sometimes doctorates. This internship method has been implemented for the past three years. Twelve students have graduated and returned to China. Currently, each student in training receives a subsidy of 500 to 600 U.S. dollars to cover six months of living and travel expenses. The Foundation spends a total of 12,000 U.S. dollars for them. He hopes to raise more funds in China and the United States in the future to increase the number of interns.

### Staff Neglect at Tonghui Primary School, Distant Cause: Corruption in the School Supplies Cooperative, Recent Cause: Teachers and Staff Requesting Increased Subsidies, Desks Destroyed, Significant Losses

(Dahua News Agency) The private Tonghui Primary School, run by the Shanghai Shaoxing Shuimu Industrial Institute at 253 Malong Road in the French Concession of this city, suddenly experienced a staff neglect storm yesterday afternoon. According to the Dahua News Agency reporter's investigation, the matter is as follows: Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the cost of living has increased day by day. The school's teachers have repeatedly requested subsidies. The school has increased subsidies three times, the first time by 8 yuan, the second time by 7 yuan, and the third time by 5 yuan, for a total of 20 yuan. At the end of the aforementioned term, the teachers again requested the Board of Directors to add subsidies due to the hardship of life. The Board of Directors decided to add 10 yuan after increasing tuition fees this semester due to limited school revenue. However, meals were to be handled by the teachers themselves, and another 20 yuan was subsidized. According to the original salary of the school's teachers, the lowest was 40 yuan. Together with the subsidies, they could get 100 yuan. The highest, including seniority pay, etc., was around 120 yuan. The two parties could have lived in peace, but at the beginning of this semester, it was discovered that the accounts of the school's student supplies cooperative did not match, so a request was made to the Board of Directors to investigate. After the Board of Directors investigated and found that it was true, the person in charge of the supplies cooperative was dismissed, and the principal was deemed to have failed to supervise, but there were no punishments. The teachers felt that the resolution of the Board of Directors seemed unfair to the principal, so they applied for reconsideration, but the Board of Directors still maintained the original plan, which made the teachers very dissatisfied. Recently, prices have risen even more sharply, and some teachers and staff members requested the principal a few days ago to add another 30 yuan in subsidies starting from this month, and to help with 5 dou of rice, with a deadline for a response yesterday morning. After receiving the request, the principal immediately submitted it to the Board of Directors for approval, but the teachers did not see a response from the Board of Directors when the time came. Some teachers then went on strike in the afternoon, and the school order was disrupted. The students were emotionally agitated and even destroyed desks and chairs. All the classrooms above the second grade were almost completely destroyed, resulting in significant losses. It is understood that the educational authorities have sent people to mediate, and the teachers have also made some statements.

### Qualification Review of Training Directors Transferred to the Ministry of Education

(Chongqing Aviation News) The Qualification Review Committee for Training Directors and Civic Teachers in various provinces and cities was originally under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Now that the Ministry of Social Affairs has been reorganized, its responsibilities have been determined separately. With regard to this review document, the Ministry of Social Affairs submitted a resolution of the 169th Standing Committee of the Central Committee, which decided that it should be managed by the Ministry of Education. It is reported that the original regulations on the Qualification Review of Training Directors and Civic Teachers and the organizational regulations of the Qualification Review Committee have been sent by the Ministry of Social Affairs to the Ministry of Education for revision based on the resolution of the Central Standing Committee. The Qualification Review Committee for Training Directors and Civic Teachers should be organized by the educational administrative authorities, but the principle of appointing personnel recommended by the local Party headquarters to participate as members of the committee must be followed.

### Securities, Domestic and Foreign Stocks Rise Together, Shanghai Water and Electricity Stocks Listed in London Also Rise

The gray market for public bonds changed greatly yesterday. It was rumored that the Four Banks were still preparing to resume business in the short term, and that security could be guaranteed after that. Financial resources would still be fully adjusted, people's hearts were stable, and market prices rose sharply. General floats rose to hedge, and many parties re-engaged in pressure. Market prices eased slightly once in the early market, but rose sharply by more than one yuan in the afternoon. In the early morning, Tongkang still bought, and Defu also had an appetite. Delong and Hongda supplied, and market prices opened at 2 yuan, then entered customs. After entering, Lianyi, Xinhua, and Xiexing raised prices to buy. Although Jiufeng, Xinchang, and Shenchang supplied, demand was greater than supply, and the price broke through 3 yuan again. The afternoon closed firmly and slightly higher. In the afternoon, news spread widely. Zhongfuhao, who had long been in the water, suddenly had an appetite. Tongkang's multi-party added code. The opening rose by 4 corners. Xinfu and Xinhua both bought in, but Hongda, Lianhe, Xinchang, and Jiufeng still sold out, but supply and demand still felt disparate. Category C opened at 3 yuan 7 corners and suddenly broke through 4 yuan, reaching a maximum of 4 yuan 4 corners. The difference between high and low was more than 1 yuan and 5 corners, seeing the fierceness of the public bond reaction. The closing was slightly lower, resulting in a sharp rise of 7 corners to 1 yuan and 2 corners. The transaction was 3 million. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading, 25 shares of Guohua Bank stock were traded, the price was 77 yuan.

The public stock market opened steadily, and the trend was quite active. The amount of transactions was the most seen in recent weeks. Prices tended to rise slightly compared to the previous closing. Asian shares rose by 4 corners between opening and closing. Shanghai public shares rose in a surprising surge, with 126,000 shares traded. The opening price was only 5 yuan 9 corners and a half, and it rose to a high price of 6 yuan 8 corners to close. Rubber stock transactions were relatively sparse.

Shaw, Manager of Xiangmao Foreign Firm, Kedah Bahru, Bokun, and Oak Limited are scheduled to pay an interim dividend for the year ending June 1941 on May 9. Shaw will pay 2 yuan and 5 corners per share, Kedah Bahru will pay 2 corners per share, and Bokun will pay 1 corner and 2 cents per share.

Botoe Annam Rubber Limited, managed by Huitong Foreign Firm, had a net profit of over 650,000 yuan in 1940.

### Foodstuffs: The Price of Foreign Rice Subsidy Still Secretly Rising, Hong Kong Rice Already Priced in Shanghai

Yesterday, foreign rice was slightly more active. Although actual sales by rice merchants were not yet robust, the countryside, inland areas, and households in western Shanghai were gradually becoming active. The total daily transaction volume inside and outside the city was four to five thousand bags. Due to limited supply in the market, those holding goods took the opportunity to raise prices in secret dealings. The subsidy price for "Small Pattern" rice increased again from one thousand to one thousand one or two hundred yuan per hundred bags, while Saigon No. 1 was quoted at one thousand six hundred yuan. The market situation was suddenly tighter than the previous two days. There was no formal market for domestic rice either.

The cost for specially milled, small-grain, broken rice from Hong Kong-supplied Rangoon White rice, with 42% broken content, including fees and commissions, amounted to HK$274.10 per ton, which at an exchange rate of 4.8 yuan per Hong Kong dollar, was equivalent to Shanghai currency of 131.56 yuan per bag, or 110 yuan per market dan. It is claimed that 50,000 bags are available for loading in early May, managed by foreign merchants in Shanghai on behalf of Hong Kong suppliers, but there are various other restrictions, so negotiations are needed before an agreement can be reached.

### Slight Suppression Seen in Flour Market

The current market conditions for foreign flour appear slightly sluggish. This is because after a period of active sales in recent days, the rice market stagnated, and there was a large arrival of new "Can Flour" brands. Customers took this opportunity to suppress prices, while those holding goods still tried to maintain prices, resulting in a stalemate in the market. In the end, "Golden Dragon" brand Can Flour opened at 30.078 yuan, and the newly arrived "Cabbage" brand at 31 yuan, with nearly ten thousand bags transacted. However, Australian flour of the "Clock Tower" and "Flower and Bird" brands, due to limited inventory, still sold for 31.45 yuan. Cheap flour from Chinese factories remained at 25 yuan, with 5,872 bags supplied by Fuxin Mill.

Wheat trading was also in a stalemate. Inland Du wheat had long been exhausted, and Chinese factories were unable to smoothly purchase raw materials. Only Japanese factory outlets occasionally made purchases, with prices remaining around 45-46 yuan.

### Oil Cakes: Spot Oil Cake Prices Soften as Lianyue Oil Futures Settle, But Term Cake Remains Firm

Yesterday, among miscellaneous grains, except for soybeans, which showed a tendency to be firmly supported, other varieties generally trended downwards slightly. For example, spot oil (futures contracts of Dalian Oil traded before the price limit were settled at 164.5 yuan as of the 16th). In the context of a downturn in actual sales, spot oil cakes unanimously softened. However, the market for term oil cakes remained lively due to the intense speculative fervor, though not as tense as the previous day. It opened with 2,000 pieces of Xing Ji spot cakes, priced at 19.9 yuan, and contracts for May delivery were at 19.85 yuan to 20.05 yuan for the first ten days of May, and 20.04 yuan to 21 yuan, later settling at 20.09 yuan for the last twenty days of May, with a total transaction volume of 20,000 pieces. Chang Ji cakes for the last ten days of April traded at 19.7 yuan, the first ten days of May at 20 yuan, and the last twenty days of May at 20.04 yuan, with over 4,000 pieces transacted. Fei Zi cakes for the first ten days of May traded at 20 yuan for two truckloads. Yuan Long cakes traded for three truckloads at 20.067 yuan. Lu Zi cakes for the last twenty days of May traded for 1,000 pieces at 20 yuan. Yuan Ji cakes for the first ten days of May traded for 1,000 pieces at 19.75 yuan. Shen Ji Li Zi general delivery traded for 3,000 pieces, with May's last period deliveries priced at 20.07 yuan.

On the 26th, 220 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Shows Slight Signs of Easing

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The informal market for British and American currencies trended slightly lower. The price of gold fell to within the 6,700 yuan range, and speculators rushed to sell after the market opened in the morning. This was initially offset by absorption from Chinese banks, including the Shanghai Continental Bank. However, near noon, HSBC and American banks suddenly sold, revealing a tendency to ease again. Nevertheless, the interbank rate for US dollars in May remained at 5.1875, making it difficult for speculators to settle their positions. British gold remained firm at 3 pence 1/875. In the afternoon, bank absorption became stagnant, while speculators' selling pressure intensified. US dollars for June had to be sold at 5.21875. Ultimately, the market closed with both US dollars at 5.1875 and British gold at 3 pence 1/875 showing a slight easing. It was reported that interbank trading was dominant throughout the day.

**Interbank Transactions Dominate**

Since the morning, the foreign exchange market has been stable, with no changes in the Shanghai market. There was no market for US dollars or Indian rupees. Among foreign exchange rates, the US dollar appreciated by half a point against the British pound, while others remained unchanged. The opening selling prices for spot currencies by banks were 3 pence 1.171875 for British currency and 5.15625 yuan for US dollars. Speculators initially exerted pressure to sell US dollars for April/May at 5.1875, creating a slight upward pressure. However, because the Shanghai Continental Bank and other banks successively absorbed the supply, the actual closing price remained at 5.15625 yuan. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. Later, the market remained quite stable. Around 11:30 AM, HSBC and a certain American bank collectively sold April/May US dollars to McCargar and a certain Chinese bank, still at 5.1875 yuan. However, by the noon close, the US dollar was still at 5.15625 yuan, while British currency had strengthened to 3 pence 1/875.

**Speculation Arises, Sales Increase**

In the afternoon, foreign banks again engaged in interbank trading of US dollars for May at 5.1875. Speculators rushed to sell, and then sold US dollars for June at 5.21875. The market situation was quite relaxed. At the 4:00 PM close, the spot rate and the May futures rate for both British currency were 3 pence 1/875, and the US dollar was 5.185, both higher than the previous day's closing price by 0.015625, and the US dollar higher by 0.03125.

**Hong Kong British and American Currencies Remain Stable**

Hong Kong, 25th (Friday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning, with no gains or losses in any currency. (Note that the Shanghai spot exchange rate closed at 470 yuan yesterday.) At 11:30 AM, it was reported flat. The Shanghai spot exchange rate decreased by five cents, to 469.5 yuan, with no other changes.

**Tianjin Exchange Rate Sees Contraction**

Tianjin, 25th (Friday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The London telegraphic transfer rate was tight at 0.015625, at 3 pence 2.234375. The New York telegraphic transfer rate contracted by 0.03125, to 5.25 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 25 cents, to 97.25 yuan. The informal rate for "Joint Notes" was expensive at 1.75 yuan, to 49.25 yuan.

### Gold Market Declines Again as Supply Increases

Yesterday's gold market, both the spot market and the informal market, fluctuated and declined, with prices retreating to within the 6,700 yuan range. It was reported that the four major Chinese banks would resume operations at the beginning of next week, and people's sentiment gradually stabilized. Foreign exchange also reported easing, and Anglo-American commercial banks such as HSBC supplied gold for sale. The trend of selling in the market did not cease. Gold shops and exchange merchants, such as Xinyuan, competed to sell, and long positions were continuously cut. The price, which opened in the morning at 6,720 yuan, steadily declined, reaching a low of 6,668 yuan in the afternoon. Finally, support from Shanghai-based firms covering short positions pushed the price up to 6,679 yuan, a decrease of 30 yuan. The market was even weaker after the close. A total of 30,000 taels were traded throughout the day. The premium for swapping (April to May) was high, with sellers offering a larger premium to buyers. Xinyuan offered 900 taels at a price of 45 yuan, followed by an additional 400 taels offered by Lintai at 50 yuan, which were bought by Yiyuan. In the afternoon, Yida offered an additional 700 taels to Yuji at a price of 50 yuan. No spot transactions were made throughout the day. Sellers were asking for a premium of 160 yuan over the term delivery price, while buyers were only offering a premium of 150 yuan, a decrease of more than 40 yuan compared to the previous day. Ornamental gold was also quoted down by 5 yuan, to 705 yuan.

**Spot Gold Continues to Decline by 30 Yuan**

Since the morning, the opening price per bar (10 taels) with a fineness of 0.15 was 6,720 yuan, an increase of 11 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Xinfeng Yong, Rencheng Yong, and Yifeng sold off, and the price declined rapidly, retreating to 6,695 yuan. However, foreign exchange remained stable and did not ease. Cheng Ji, Yida, Hesheng, Defu, and Dafeng came forward to support the market, and the price was pushed up to 6,718 yuan. Xinyuan, Yiyuan, and Xinfeng Yong sold off, and the price hovered slightly around 6,710 yuan. Until noon, when HSBC sold US dollars at 5 yuan, the market saw further downward pressure to within 6,700 yuan, to 6,685 yuan, as retail investors also sold. Cheng Ji bought in, and the price was pushed up again. The noon close was 6,704 yuan. The opening price at 2 PM in the afternoon was 6,702 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the noon close. The price then fell to 6,705 yuan. Xinyuan, Yili, Gongda, Dafeng, and Xinfeng Yong successively sold off, and as foreign exchange tended to ease, the price declined by about 30 yuan, retreating to 6,668 yuan. Because Tianyuan and Deda bought in, and Xinfeng Yong repurchased, with support from Shanghai firms covering short positions, the price immediately rebounded to 6,680 yuan. The market closed at 4 PM at 6,679 yuan, a further decrease of 30 yuan compared to the previous night's close, and was settled at 6,713 yuan, based on the May US dollar price of 5 yuan, a decrease of 30 yuan. After the close, the price further declined to 6,670 yuan, finally settling at 72-73 yuan. The overall fluctuation was 51 yuan. The selling price of genuine gold from spot gold shops was 170 yuan higher than the spot gold futures price, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for spot gold.

**Ornamental Gold Quoted Down by 5 Yuan Yesterday**

The exchange price for gold jewelry from gold shops was quoted down by 5 yuan by Datonghang and Xintonhang at 11:30 AM, to 705 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by 40 yuan).

### Gold Sovereigns Suddenly in Demand, Rise by One Yuan Alone

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw fluctuating and declining spot gold prices. However, British and American gold sovereigns suddenly experienced demand, and their market prices each rose by one yuan. British gold notes remained stable, and the market price stood at par. The rise and fall of American gold notes were still very sudden, ultimately closing down by one cent and three points. The evening market retreated to 18 yuan and 85 cents. Hong Kong notes were evenly supplied and demanded, and the market price remained flat. Japanese gold notes remained unchanged, and the evening market remained at 2 yuan and 10 cents, the original price. Korean notes experienced a slight increase in demand, and the evening market rose to 1 yuan and 85 cents.

### Yarn and Cotton: War in Eastern Zhejiang Escalates, Hindering Inland Transportation of Yarn and Cloth Again, Long Positions in Double Horse Yarn Being Sold Off

The yarn market is trending downwards, with the trend shifting from fluctuation to weakness. This is due to the sluggish sales of current yarn, coupled with the escalation of the war in eastern Zhejiang, which has hindered the inland transportation of yarn and cloth again. As a result, market sentiment is depressed, and short sellers are actively trading. Some long positions, recognizing the unfavorable environment, are gradually selling off. At the same time, certain entities are opening very large short positions and remaining unmoved. Therefore, there seems to be an excess of positions on the table, and with the imminent resumption of operations by the four major banks and the stability of foreign exchange, those holding long positions are showing slight uneasiness. As a result, talk of a price decline is rampant again. The general consensus is that a sharp decline is unlikely, and that one can buy in at 1,450 yuan. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 5,492 yuan, and the low price was 1,484 yuan. The initial trade in the afternoon was at 1,486 yuan, followed by a decline in the spot gold price to 1,479 yuan, with the final price being 1,481-82 yuan. Today, 165 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

The opening for Double Horse yarn was mediocre, as there were very few positive factors in the material market, and market sentiment was weak. The initial price was 1,488 yuan, and shortly thereafter it rose slightly to 1,492 yuan. Soon after, the spot gold market also opened peacefully, and as a result, trading on the market was extremely light. The market price once fluctuated between 90 yuan and 88 yuan. Then, news of weak sales emerged, and long positions were being closed, causing the market to quietly ease. By 11:30 AM, the price had fallen to 1,484 yuan, but short covering by scalpers brought the closing price back to 1,487 yuan. According to the intraday transaction statistics, 6,135 bales were traded. The quantity purchased by each sector is listed below:

Hong Kong: 135 bales
Counterparties: 6,000 bales

Total: 6,135 bales

### Cotton Market Dark and Gloomy Amidst Talk of Production Cuts

The current cotton situation is extremely dark and gloomy, with trading activity being unusually sluggish. This is due to the weakness of the yarn market and factory shutdowns, as well as the significant decline in foreign cotton prices, which has caused market sentiment to deteriorate. Yesterday, the only spot cotton transaction was 200 bales of Tong Yujin fire machine cotton, with the warehouse delivery price at 196 yuan.

Another report indicates that foreign cotton trading in Shanghai foreign firms seems quieter than before. This is because the international situation has been quite critical in recent days, causing people to be apprehensive. At the same time, due to the trending decline in the current yarn market and the impending reality of production cuts in yarn factories, the willingness to purchase has weakened, and the market situation has also softened slightly.

The New York cotton market remains volatile and uneven, with the decline due to long position liquidations and selling by Southern firms. Yesterday's closing prices were lower than the previous day by 3-5 points.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to short covering, then stabilized due to selling by cotton merchants. However, it later rose due to reactions to field reports. At the same time, European exporters continued to buy, pushing the market forward. As a result, closing prices rose by 2-6 rupees. It is predicted that the market will open slightly lower by half a rupee today.

### Piece Goods: Eastern Zhejiang and Fujian Merchants Discounting and Selling Off Returned Goods

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was slightly soft, with sluggish customer sales. Merchants from eastern Zhejiang and Fujian are continuing to sell off un-shipped and returned goods cheaply, according to the market. However, counterparts and stockists are holding firm to their inventories. Factory futures prices are again being raised, which goes against the lower prices in the market. Yesterday, white goods, fine cloth, and twill fell by 25 cents, while coarse cloth fell by 25 cents to 50 cents. Selling prices for bleached and dyed cloth saw mixed increases and decreases. About 200 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Southeast Asian merchants traded over 200 pieces of Yihua and Lunyuan bleached cloth, blue cloth, patterned cloth, and flannel. Today, 180 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: Market sentiment is weak, due to limited sales and the selling off of goods by individual merchants. The closing price for white goods, fine cloth, and the current warehouse receipt market was 51.15 yuan. Junzi Serge was priced at 1.5415 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Drop Sharply, Falling One to Five Yuan

Yesterday's sugar market trend remained weak, with prices dropping sharply and consistently. The international situation also showed signs of easing, leaving long positions with nothing to rely on, and there was considerable selling. As a result, prices became softer. The Exchange's settlement price for spot goods of No. 24 raw white sugar was 99.5 yuan to 109 yuan, down by 3 yuan. Futures deliveries at the end of April initially tightened then eased, opening at 101 yuan, then rising slightly to 101.5, 101.2, and 101 yuan, before falling back into the 100 yuan range to 100.008, 100.007, 100.005, 99 yuan, 99.5, 99.6, 99.5, 99.1, and 99.2. Deliveries on May 10 initially cost 102 yuan, 102.8, 103, 103.3, 103, 102.5, 102.4, 102.2, 102, and 101.5, easing slightly to 100.005, 100.007, and 100.007. A slight rebound mid-session put the price at 101, 101.2, and 101 yuan, but closing remained soft at 100.005, 100.008, and 100.007, all down by 1.8 yuan. Due to continued arrivals, Taikoo granulated white sugar also experienced a sharp decline, with B Mark East Warehouse goods at 105 yuan, down 5 yuan, and HHX Mark East Warehouse goods at 98.5 yuan, down 2.7 yuan. Dutch red sugar was relatively cheap at 79.5 yuan, down 5 cents.

### Metals: New Standard Lead Wire Remains Firm

The new lead wire market has been unable to get going due to lack of follow-up from traders and limited wholesale transactions. However, sporadic sales in front of shops are not bad. There is not much goods circulating on the market, so those holding goods are keeping their prices up. The market price for sizes 16 to 20 is 320 yuan per metric ton, while the price for fine colors of sizes 21 to 25 is still 350 yuan per metric ton. Standards can be said to be firm, but actual transactions are quite deserted.

### Dried Goods: Water Tung Branches Continue to Be Offered

Although the disposal of Water Tung branches and Haikou branches has recently been very quiet, prices are still reasonable and the prospects are not without hope. Therefore, merchants are still willing to buy them. As for the inventories in the hands of dealers, if they want to keep them, they must increase the refrigeration or roasting costs, so they are also willing to sell them off. It was heard yesterday that 1,000-2,000 boxes were being offered, and prices were similar to before, with not much change.

### Opium Poppy (Continued)

— Gao Jiannong

Historically, the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Indians knew how to cultivate and utilize it since more than 1,000 years B.C. For example, Homer tells us in the Iliad that Helen, the beauty who caused the Trojan War in the 12th century B.C., personally poured "wine of oblivion" for her husband's comrades - those melancholy warriors. This wine of oblivion contained opium ingredients. As for Helen's knowledge of this secret recipe, it was taught to her by an Egyptian witch. The Greek myth of "Hypnos", who guides people to the land of sleep, wears a poppy garland on his head and holds a cup of opium, also called "Thebes juice". Thebes is a reference to the origin of opium, which is not the famous Greek city, but also Egypt. As for Heracles, the hero whom the Greeks most respectfully praised for his twelve great feats, his eleventh feat was to steal the golden apple from a garden in Africa, guarded day and night by a venomous dragon. Heracles mixed opium with honey and fed it to the fierce venomous dragon, putting it to sleep before he could steal it. Moreover, in recent years, European archaeologists have discovered the existence of opium poppies in the ancient lake dwellings of the ancient lake dwellers of Switzerland. It is difficult to say that most of this anecdotal evidence is mythical, but even judging by the era in which these myths were written, their understanding of the efficacy of opium was far back in the eighth and ninth centuries B.C.

Furthermore, according to the continued compilation of the "Ciyuan" citing the Buddhist scripture "Kunaiye Miscellaneous Laws," it says, "When the Buddha was in Wangcheng, Changying suffered from illness, and he once inhaled medicinal smoke and was relieved of his suffering. The monks asked Changying, and the Buddha said: 'Those who are ill may inhale smoke for treatment.' The monks did not know how to put medicine for treatment, and the Buddha said: 'You can combine two bowls, pierce a hole at the bottom, put fire in the middle, and put medicine in it for inhalation. Bamboo should not be used, but iron can be used, twelve fingers in length, not too sharp, nor too rough. Put it in the hole of the bowl to inhale the smoke. When used, do not discard it rashly. It can be put in a small bag and hung on an ivory tusk or bamboo...' Afterwards, when using it, it should not be washed with water, but should be burned in the fire to purify it..." This truly describes the shape of the pipe and smoking pipe, the method of smoking, and the method of preserving the smoking pipe, with the utmost clarity! There is no doubt that this is the origin of opium smoking. However, who is the author of this Buddhist scripture? When was it written? Can it really be traced back to the time of Sakyamuni? I think even if it was a little later than the founding of Buddhism in the sixth century B.C., it would not have been too long ago. (Editor's note: Buddhism often disparages smoking, and compares it to the so-called. How do we know that this is not smoke coming from an earlier time?)

In the early seventh century A.D., Muhammad and his brave followers rose from the Arabian desert and laid the foundation for the Heavenly Kingdom - the Islamic Empire. Its culture inherited the remnants of ancient Egypt and Greece. Therefore, Muslim physicians were clearly aware of the effects of opium poppy, and the use of this medicine naturally expanded day by day. (To be continued)

### 3,000 People Attend the Funeral of the Lone Battalion, Xie Jinyuan's Body is Encoffined, The Ceremony is Solemn, Guests are Deeply Mourning, The Authorities Send People to Mourn and Handle the Aftermath

After Colonel Xie Jinyuan, the commander of the Lone Battalion who defended the Four Banks Warehouse during the August 13th incident and fought heroically, was poisoned by rebel soldiers in the Lone Battalion Camp on Jiaozhou Road the day before yesterday, all sectors of the country were deeply saddened. All the soldiers of the Lone Battalion immediately organized the "Lone Battalion Funeral Committee" to handle the aftermath. A small funeral was held at 7 PM that evening. Then, at 11 AM yesterday, a large funeral was held in the Lone Battalion Camp. The ceremony was solemn, and no less than 3,000 people attended, all weeping at the coffin. At that time, the wind was howling and the rain was pouring, which added to the grief. The ceremony did not end until 2 PM. Xie's body was temporarily placed in the auditorium and will be buried in the Lone Battalion Camp on a selected date. The details are recorded as follows:

**Solemn and Respectful Decoration of the Funeral Hall**

The decoration of the auditorium was extremely solemn. A plain archway was erected in front of the gate, and the interior was covered with white curtains and blue and white cloth lamps were hung. Eulogies sent from various parties were hung on the left and right sides, including "A generation of accomplished people are ashamed to be later dead because they were alive and happy, and 4 million people cry for the deceased because he died in the right place" from the 30,000 employees of the Shanghai Coal Ball Industry, and "His heroic spirit will last forever" from the Three People's Principles Youth League. Clear drinks and simple dishes were placed on the stage, and white candles were lit. Xie's portrait of looking into the distance on horseback was placed on the top, with his heroic posture making people stand in awe. The eulogy "Loyalty Shines Through the Ages" from all the Lone Battalion soldiers was hung above, with the eulogy from Lieutenant Lei and all the soldiers hanging next to it. More than 20 wreaths sent from various parties were placed beside them. The national flag and the military flag were hung on the wall behind, with the word "Dedication" decorated with neon lights in the center. Xie's body was placed in front of it, covered with red silk and a bright national flag, which was extremely solemn. Two guards were stationed next to the body.

**More Than 3,000 People Went to Pay Their Respects**

Yesterday, all 300+ Lone Battalion soldiers wore black gauze on their left arms and mourned in accordance with the army's funeral regulations. They will not remove it until after the burial. Yesterday, the outside guests reached more than 3,000 people, mostly young students, business circles, and labor circles, who all sent representatives to participate. In addition, the Shanghai Orphanage, the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Center, and the Pingjiang Children's Education Center each sent a band to participate. Because there were too many guests, they entered in batches, causing the entrance of the Lone Battalion Camp to be extremely crowded. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department specially sent many police officers to maintain order. The guests who participated in the camp also wore black gauze to mourn. In addition to sending wreaths and other offerings, they also presented condolence money.

**Guests and Soldiers Shed Tears**

The encoffining ceremony was held at 11:00 AM yesterday. The soldiers and guests stood in silence, and Lieutenant Lei presided over the ceremony, and then the encoffining was carried out. Xie's body was dressed in Chinese formal attire, and after being made up, his appearance was still vivid and lifelike. Then, ten people, including the battalion commander and Xie's close friends, carried the body into the coffin. At this time, mournful music was played, and the tone was sad. All the soldiers and guests shed tears. Several female students who stood next to the coffin and usually admired Xie deeply wept bitterly, and each placed her own photo in the coffin. At that time, many of the guests were deeply saddened. Then, everyone bowed three times to Xie's body, and observed three minutes of silence, then played sad music again and looked at the remains. When all the soldiers and guests lined up and circled the coffin, everyone was in tears. More than a dozen elementary school students even cried out loud. The depth of Xie's charismatic personality can be seen from this. At this time, the wind and rain outside stirred the guests' grief even more. The ceremony did not end until 2 PM.

**Representatives of the Authorities Visited to Comfort**

Yesterday at 5:00 AM, Zheng Shisen and others, representatives sent by the highest authorities of China and the UK stationed in Shanghai, arrived at the Lone Battalion Camp in the heavy rain. First, they represented the Shanghai groups and paid tribute to Commander Xie's coffin, and then summoned all the officers and soldiers to give instructions and announce the aftermath measures. Before receiving orders from China and the UK, Major Lei Xiong was appointed as the highest person in charge of the battalion.

**Another Date to be Set for Burial in the Camp**

The funeral of Xie was handled by the International Funeral Home, and his coffin was made of camphor wood, priced at 6,000 yuan. After the encoffining was completed yesterday, it was covered with the national flag and temporarily placed in the auditorium. Once the date is selected, it will be buried in the small garden in front of Xie's bedroom in the Lone Battalion Camp, so that all the comrades can look up to him day and night. It is said that Xie's bad news has been sent by the Lone Battalion to his family in Jiaoling, Guangdong. However, it is said that Xie's family has moved to the Guangxi border due to the war, so it is still unknown whether the telegram can reach his family. According to Xie's adjutant, the black cat, parrot, and pigeon that Xie raised each died suddenly the night before Xie's death. The reason is unknown. Was this an omen of his death?

**Police Authorities Prepare to Prosecute**

The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that the Public Concession Police Authorities are preparing to prosecute the four murderers of Colonel Xie Jinyuan, commander of the Lone Battalion: Zhang Guoshun, Hao Jingcheng, Zhang Wenqing, and You Yaoliang. The four are still being held in the police station and will be sent to the First Special District Court for trial next week. It is reported that the First Special Court received the official document submitted by the Police Department yesterday and issued a detention warrant to allow the murderers to be temporarily detained pending the official prosecution by the Police Department next week. According to this morning's news, the Police Department is continuing its investigation of the case. It is reported that Shangguan Zhibiao, who was injured, is in better condition this morning.

### Commercial Banks Exert Utmost Effort to Maintain Stability at the End of April

Since the Central, Communications, Farmers, and Bank of China Shanghai branches announced a temporary suspension of business, the head office has telegraphed orders for an earlier resumption. As the end of April approaches, industry and commerce have not experienced hindrance due to the temporary closure of the four banks. This is because private and local banks, considering this period a critical phase for loan repayments, are exerting utmost effort to maintain stability in the wartime Shanghai financial market in accordance with the regulations set by the Ministry. They are processing large-scale interbank lending as much as possible to enhance the use of market financial resources. Special accommodations are being made for the collateral submitted by various businesses. The exchange rate for internal transactions has been set at five yuan by the money changers.

### Interpretation of Ambiguities in Shanghai Special District Trademark Registration

The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to clarify ambiguities in Article 4 of the "Measures for Handling Trademark Registration Applications Submitted by Merchants in the Shanghai Special District and Various Guerrilla Areas During Extraordinary Times," as requested by merchants in the Shanghai Special District and various guerrilla areas, has instructed the Trademark Bureau as follows: "Received and noted. The purpose of the 'Measures for Handling Trademark Registration Applications Submitted by Merchants in the Shanghai Special District and Various Guerrilla Areas During Extraordinary Times' is clearly stated in Article 2. The matters presented in Article 4 are to clarify that they are unrelated to Item 3 of Paragraph 1 of Article 2 of the 'Regulations for Identification and Prohibition,' and to provide factual proof. Moreover, Articles 3 and 4 are accompanied by parentheses, making their intent even clearer, thus requiring no further explanation. Regarding the four points inquired by the New Asia Chemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.: (1) A detailed list of shareholders and technicians, including their names, native places, and addresses, should be provided. If there are no changes at the time of application, a clear declaration can be made. (2) The transportation method of foreign raw materials should specify the means of transport and its nationality, as well as the place of origin, and vague terms such as 'water transport, railway, aviation,' etc., should not be used. (3) Borrowing or mortgaging refers to substantial loans or mortgages, with emphasis on the nationality and residence of the creditor, and is unrelated to ordinary dealings with money shops. (4) The Shanghai Special District and guerrilla areas are most susceptible to seizure, control, and exploitation, and the situation is subject to constant change. Even for goods designated as prohibited by this Ministry, which are mostly registered companies of Chinese merchants, the required information should not be waived based on a long history. The above four points should be addressed accordingly. The Bureau should carefully review each application on a case-by-case basis, verifying the accuracy of the information provided. If any discrepancy is found and there is a situation as described in Article 7 of these measures, it should be handled in accordance with that article. Please comply with this order."

### Cairn, General Manager of Jardine Matheson, Leaves Shanghai Last Night

Cairn, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council and General Manager of Jardine Matheson, has left Shanghai. After the Annual Meeting of Foreign Ratepayers on August 17, where he was succeeded by Shippam as chairman, he announced his intention to return to England to visit his wife. It is now known that Mr. Cairn boarded the ferry "Manila Maru" at the Customs House Wharf at 7:30 last night and transferred to the "Coolidge" bound for England. Last night, Municipal Council members Mitchell, Minsde, Okamoto, Allerman, and Chief Secretary Fessenden, along with other senior officials, went to the wharf to see him off. Mr. Cairn shook hands with each person, slowly boarded the ship, and waved his handkerchief as the whistle sounded, appearing somewhat saddened. Although Mr. Cairn stated that he was returning to England, it is widely believed that he will spend a longer period in the United States.

### Fighting Still Occurring in Eastern Suburbs of Cixi

According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, who inquired with Shanghai-based Zhejiang provincial organizations: (1) In Fenghua and Cixi, which were invaded by Japanese troops, there are still mobile battles occurring in the eastern suburbs of Cicheng, as well as Jiangkou (southwest of Ningbo) in Lishe, and Xiaowang Temple. (2) A portion of the Japanese troops has advanced to Yuyao, and the situation there is chaotic and unclear. (3) The Japanese troops who landed in Shipu, Haimen, and Wenzhou have made no progress. (4) Chinese forces are gathering along the coast of eastern Zhejiang, and it is expected that the war situation will develop in new ways.

Students of Ji Shan Middle School Detained

According to a person who recently sought refuge in Shanghai from Shaoxing, Shaoxing fell on the morning of the 17th. At that time, most of the residents had evacuated the city. Intermittent street fighting occurred in the city, and approximately 400 people were killed or injured by machine gun fire. More than 300 students from Ji Shan Middle School were detained and are currently being held in the Bank of China building in the city. The situation in the city is quite desolate.

### "Izumo" Returns to Shanghai Yesterday

The "Izumo," a flagship of the Japanese Third Fleet, left Shanghai at 9:00 AM on the 19th of this month and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. It is still berthed at the China Merchants Bureau wharf in Hongkou. The round trip lasted a week.

### Ensuring Security in May: Implementing Joint Defense and Alertness; Labor Day Holiday for Workers; Emergency Measures by Military and Police on Various Commemorative Days

May 1st is International Labor Day, a day commemorating the global labor movement's fight for the "3-8 System" (8 hours of work, 8 hours of rest, 8 hours of sleep). Workers in this city, believing that the day is imminent, are actively preparing for celebrations. The concession police authorities, considering the numerous commemorative days in May, are implementing a month-long emergency alert starting from that day. Details are as follows:

Citywide Workers Prepare for Celebrations

International Labor Day is a festival for the implementation of the 3-8 system. Although Chinese laborers have not yet achieved this goal, they are gradually moving towards liberation. Therefore, workers across the country attach great importance to this commemorative day. In the past, rallies and grand celebrations were held on this day. However, since the war, the environment in Shanghai has been unique, so extravagant events have not been held. The environment remains the same this year, so commemorative ceremonies will still be suspended. However, to express their commitment to this great and sacred festival, all workers will stop work for one day on that day, to solemnly and solemnly follow the workers of the world in fighting for liberation and freedom, emulate the fighting spirit of international workers, pledge allegiance, support national policies, and strive for victory.

Concession Authorities Implement Joint Defense and Alertness

The police authorities in the two concessions, considering the numerous commemorative days in May and the special circumstances in Shanghai, fear that malicious elements may take the opportunity to engage in illegal activities, affecting the security of the concessions and disrupting public order. Therefore, they have decided to implement a month-long emergency alert starting from May 1st. The two concessions will take joint defense actions. During this month, posts will be added at various key transportation points, and detectives will be dispatched to patrol the streets. In addition, national defense forces from various countries, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and male and female inspection teams will be fully mobilized to perform security, interception, and emergency search operations. Emergency measures will be implemented on each commemorative day, closing alleys and unnecessary roads and bridges.

The curfew will also be strictly enforced to ensure the security of the concessions and the peace of the public.

### French-Owned Water, Electricity, and Public Transportation Prices to Increase Tomorrow; French Municipal Council Approves Implementation; Transportation Fares Increase by 2 to 6 Fen Per Stop

The French-owned water and electricity company in the French Concession has been facing difficulties in fuel transportation recently, and the situation is no longer the same as before. Therefore, on the one hand, it has organized a current restriction committee with the French Concession authorities to discuss the implementation of measures for users within the concession to conserve electricity. On the other hand, due to rising costs, it will also implement a surcharge on water and electricity from tomorrow (the 27th), and also increase the prices of trams and public buses within the concession at the same time.

Water and Electricity Surcharge

According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, who learned from the company yesterday that the company has decided to implement a surcharge on water and electricity users within the concession from tomorrow, and also uniformly increase the fares for trams, trolleybuses, and public buses operating within the concession at the same time. This measure has been approved by the French Municipal Council and notified to the French Consulate in Shanghai. According to the person in charge of the company, the electricity surcharge will increase from 103% to 125%, the electricity (motor) and electric cooking and heating appliance surcharges will increase from 140% to 190%, and the tap water surcharge will increase from 49% to 75%.

Transportation Fares to Increase Simultaneously

The above surcharges are more than double or triple those of a year ago (the electricity and electric heating surcharges were 60% and tap water surcharge was 30% a year ago). The decision to increase tram and public bus fares from tomorrow will increase transportation fares by 2 to 6 fen per stop, according to the current original price for short and long distances.

### Commercial Press Dispute: Negotiations Today

After Lu Gaoyi, General Manager of the World Book Company, telegraphed Wang Yunwu, General Manager of the Commercial Press in Hong Kong, with the assistance of Ms. Xing De of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Labour Section, a reply was received from Hong Kong yesterday. The original text was very long and is omitted here. According to Mr. Lu, speaking to the labour representatives, it is necessary to first study and consider the matter in detail with the Municipal Council before convening labour representatives at the Industrial Section of the Municipal Council at 10:00 AM tomorrow (today) to begin preliminary negotiations. Whether there will be a turning point will be decided today. It is reported that the labour representatives have prepared for possible adverse changes in order to cope with any eventuality. It is also reported that Wang Yunwu, General Manager of the Commercial Press, deeply sympathizes with the demands put forward by the employees, but since the "August 13th" Incident, the Press has suffered huge losses. Moreover, textbooks are related to culture and cannot be regarded as other goods and sold at inflated prices. Therefore, he feels powerless to meet the demands of the employees, but the employees' livelihood issues are also a fact.

### Seizure of South Seas Freighter to Be Resolved Soon

Customs Harbor Master Sugiyama stated yesterday morning (25th) that the seizure of the South Seas freighter "Tomislav" by the Italian troops stationed in Shanghai may be resolved soon. He is currently consulting with the Italian authorities in an effort to release the ship. The entire incident involves complex diplomatic issues, but he expects it to be resolved in the short term. He declined to disclose further details. The "Tomislav" was still guarded by Italian troops yesterday, and the Italian authorities are unwilling to say when they will order the troops to withdraw from the ship. Meanwhile, it is reported that the British authorities here are continuing to investigate the seizure of the "Tomislav." The customs authorities hope to prevent the matter from escalating and achieve a satisfactory conclusion.

### Rong Wu Society Schedules Lecture

### Leipzig Fair Achieves Good Results

Since its opening, the 1941 Spring Leipzig Trade Fair in Germany has achieved excellent results. All exhibits have been greatly praised by visitors from all walks of life. More than 100,000 Germans and over 9,000 foreigners visited the fair.

### Central, Communications, Farmers, and Bank of China Banks to Resume Business Next Week; Concession Authorities Promise Effective Protection; Rumors of Withdrawal Are Absolutely Untrue

After the Shanghai branches of the Central, Communications, Farmers, and Bank of China temporarily suspended business on April 17, they immediately began preparing to resume business after receiving a telegram from the head office ordering them to resume business as soon as possible. They have resumed internal operations, and the employees of the four banks, deeply aware of the importance of their responsibilities, continue to serve society. It is reported that the four banks have decided to resume business next week, and the concession authorities have promised effective protection. Regarding the entire financial situation, the four banks are determined to maintain it and restore the allocation and collection of funds from various banks, which will benefit the financial situation directly and indirectly. The rumors of withdrawal are absolutely untrue.

### The Story of Medicine (Continued)

— Qingping

Prevent Illness and Take Care of Your Health Rather Than Take Medicine After You're Sick

There are also some other images worth commemorating that are related to the modern medical history of our country. (1) T.R. Colledge: He was an American, born in 1797 and died in 1879. He was the founder of the Christian Medical Missionary Society and the founder of the earliest hospital in our country. (2) Huang Kuan: Born in 1828 and died in 1878. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh in England and was the first Chinese student to study in the West and obtain a doctorate in medicine. (3) Ms. Jin Yunmei: Born in 1864 and died in 1934. She was a doctor of medicine from the New York Women's University in the United States and was the first Chinese woman to study abroad and graduate.

In one room, there is a collection of ancient artifacts related to Chinese medicine, including the idols of the medical ancestors, medical instruments, medicine bottles, etc., and shelves of Chinese medical books, all of which are very valuable. There are also landscape paintings by doctors, and so on.

Downstairs, there is a library with a collection of medical and pharmaceutical journals from all over the world, totaling more than 200 kinds. This library is dedicated to the late Dr. Niu Huisheng, so it is named "Niu Huisheng Memorial Library." In the courtyard, there is a monument dedicated to Dr. Niu, because Dr. Niu made special contributions to the Chinese Medical Association. Another room is a library, displaying the books and magazines published by the Chinese Medical Association over the years.

The Chinese Medical Association currently publishes five kinds of publications: (1) Chinese Medical Journal (Chinese monthly), (2) Chinese Medical Journal (English monthly). These two are purely academic publications. (3) China Medical Guide, a bilingual annual that includes the names and addresses of doctors nationwide, as well as health agencies, hospitals, medical schools, medical groups, etc., in detail. (4) Chinese Health Magazine, a bimonthly in Chinese, is a popular science reading material on medical and health issues for the general public. (5) Shanghai Medical Weekly, bilingual in Chinese and English, is for medical experts in this city to exchange medical information, explore academic issues, and promote medical affairs. Among them, the Chinese Health Magazine is most suitable for the general public to read. It does not discuss profound academic theories, but only talks about daily life hygiene knowledge. As Dr. Yu Xinen, the editor of the magazine, said: "We should strive to focus on the interests and needs of the public, and try to avoid words that are too specialized or too close to textbook style, so that the public will develop a strong interest in this magazine and be able to benefit from it."

The Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Health Association are actually two sides of the same coin. The former is academic, and the latter is for the actual needs of society, directly serving the health and happiness of the public. The reporter has elaborated on this in detail in the interview with the Chinese Health Association. In addition to the nine clinics and health experiment areas, they also run a nurse training class to train nurses to serve the community; conduct broadcast speeches to instill medical and health knowledge to the public, so that their work can attract the attention of the public and thus obtain health and happiness. The public health nurse training is hosted by Ms. He Zhuxuan, and there are currently seven trainees, six of whom are sent by the Red Cross Hospital and one by Renyan Hospital; they are all nurses who are about to graduate, and they already understand how to take care of patients. Training here for another month will make them know more about how to serve in the field of public health. A new class is held every month, and the trainees are sent from public hospitals.

The current directors of the Health Association are: Diao Xinde (Chairman), Fu Wenshou (Vice Chairman), Zhou Chenghu (Treasurer), Shi Siming (Secretary), Zhu Hengbi, Hai Shende, Wang Shuzhen, Shen Jiying, Lu Meizeng, Hou Xiangchuan, Shen Siliang, Gan Lin, and Yan Suiliang. Sponsors include Feng Bingnan, Zhu Erden, Jin Baoshan, Yao Junshi, Ba Lude, and Hairy. The above-mentioned people are either responsible officials in government agencies for health-related affairs, or chairmen of well-known medical institutions and public health organizations, or social celebrities and scholars. The personnel actually in charge of the association's affairs are: Ouyang Zhong, Director-General, Huang Huaixin, Director of the Public Health District, Yu Xinen, Director of Propaganda, and He Zhuxuan, Head of the Membership Department.

How to find a "reliable doctor," and whether poor compatriots can be treated free of charge at the discretion of the doctor? On this point, the Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Health Association, even in a period of extreme financial difficulty, are faithfully and bravely shouldering this arduous responsibility. Their purpose is: "To serve with the highest academic standards and the most affordable methods for the general public. On the one hand, it is to promote health campaigns and prevent diseases in the future; on the other hand, for the treatment of diseases, nine clinics are also attached, with specialist doctors in charge of examination, diagnosis and treatment of various departments, and the very poor can also be treated free of charge. For difficult and complicated diseases, experts can also be introduced for diagnosis and treatment. Naturally, it is far better to prevent disease and maintain health than to take medicine after becoming ill; the benefits of the latter are not only that it does not cost money, but it also has a great impact on the individual's physical health and longevity. Just like a machine that has been broken once, it is never as strong as a machine that has never been broken!" (The End)

### Temporary Board of Directors Still Difficult to Establish; No Response from Relevant Countries

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," the Shanghai Municipal Council's establishment of a temporary board of directors was supported by foreign ratepayers in the Public Concession eight days ago, but it is subject to approval by the relevant countries. The Municipal Council has not yet received any response from the consuls of those countries, so the temporary board of directors cannot be established. An official in this city, when answering reporters this morning (25th), was unable to explain the reason for the delayed response from the consuls of the relevant countries. It is generally believed that the reason why the change in the Municipal Council has not been approved so far is due to the Chongqing government's statement of opposition. It is not yet known whether the relevant countries have negotiated with the Chinese government on the establishment of a temporary board of directors.

### Changes to the Limit on the Amount of Cash Carried by Travelers

The amount of cash carried by travelers was originally limited to 500 yuan. The Ministry of Finance has now issued recent supplementary regulations on restricting the carrying of cash. In addition to instructing the customs and cargo inspection offices in various war zones to follow the regulations, it has also instructed them to forward the regulations to be complied with. The regulations are slightly different from the previous ones. The main points are recorded as follows: If the amount of cash carried by travelers for circulation within the country and not for export is less than 2,000 yuan, the customs or inspection authorities should approve the release after inspection. If the amount carried is more than 3,000 yuan, the traveler must first apply to the Ministry for a passport and report to the Ministry for special approval to instruct the inspection and release. If the traveler does not hold a Ministry passport or has not been instructed by the Ministry to inspect and release, the customs inspection authorities concerned should not release it, but avoid detention and order the traveler to follow the procedures to handle it in accordance with the regulations. If the traveler must proceed and cannot stay temporarily to handle the above-mentioned procedures, the customs or inspection authorities concerned should temporarily detain the excess cash carried and release it or return it after the traveler has obtained a supplementary Ministry passport or reported to the Ministry for approval.

### First Thai Freighter Brings Rice to Shanghai; Rice Shops Limited to Sell at Designated Price, but with Restrictions

Yesterday, the rice market was still in a stalemate because hoarding households continued to drive up prices, and rice shops were unwilling to buy rice and grain at extra cost. No one came to the market, and all the brokers did not enter the market. The retail sales of rice shops yesterday were maintained as usual, and the prices were able to maintain the official price limit, but the quantity sold was restricted according to the stock of each rice shop.

Low-Priced Hong Kong Rice: Hope for Rapid Distribution

If the authorities can directly distribute the rice, which has already obtained priority of 5,000 tons, to each rice shop as soon as possible, and supply the retail market at the limited price, then the rice shops can temporarily not buy rice and grain manipulated by hoarding households in the rice market. The legitimate rice merchants should promptly participate in the group purchase of Hong Kong rice to avoid the influence of illegal elements driving up prices. It is also reported that although there was no formal transaction in the rice market yesterday, it is said that speculators still had private acts of extra cost outside the market. It is hoped that the authorities will pay close attention to this.

Four Specialists from Hong Kong Left Shanghai Yesterday

Since the Hong Kong government agreed to supply 200,000 or 250,000 bags of special small ground rice from Yangon per month, rice merchants have been enthusiastic about subscribing. In addition to formally reporting the confirmed amount to the Shanghai Municipal Council for record, the Bean and Rice Grain Association has formally organized a group rice purchase committee. It is also learned that four members sent by the Hong Kong government, including Harrah, left Shanghai yesterday to report back.

Thai Freighter Brings Rice to Shanghai

According to the "Continental Daily," the Thai Shipping Company's freighter "Sisuntnon Nawa" (1,997 tons) is carrying more than 3,000 tons of rice and is sailing from Bangkok via the Food Port. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 27th of this month and will return to sea on May 2nd after unloading the rice and grain. The company's freighter "Suriyothai Nawa" is scheduled to arrive here from Bangkok in early May. It is understood that these two ships are the first to sail to Shanghai and are of a trial nature. If the results are satisfactory, the other four freighters of the Thai Shipping Company will also sail to Shanghai to carry goods.

The Responsibility for Repeated Rice Price Increases

According to those familiar with the rice market, the rice stocks in this city have reached their peak. According to past practices, the rice price should fall sharply. However, the former rice market went the other way, with dark trading rampant and excessive prices heard from time to time. The key to the problem is nothing more than the following three points: (1) Famous rice shops have brought in foreign rice and grain, trying to hoard it, and are unwilling to release it at the limited price. At the same time, the Bean and Rice Grain Association has not taken effective steps to sanction unscrupulous colleagues. (2) Rice shop employees also bought and hoarded rice and grain, although the number is small, the rice price has been raised by these people. (3) The authorities cannot strictly enforce the rice price limit, repeatedly deciding to be lenient in the middle or cancel it, resulting in a complete loss of prestige and ineffective results.

### Victims' Bodies at Jinshanwei Were Buried in Nearby Public Cemetery

The tragic ship capsizing accident on the Hangzhou Bay Jinshanwei River drowned more than 150 Ning Shao refugees from Shanghai. Some of the bodies were claimed and buried by family members, and there were still more than 50 bodies that were unclaimed. For the sake of hygiene, it was inconvenient to display them for a long time. The Yong Shao and Tongxiang Associations sent people to bury them. It has been completed and returned to Shanghai. It is heard that the bodies of these unclaimed people were buried in the public cemetery near Jinshanwei.

### Australian and New Zealand Nationals Commemorate Fallen Soldiers: 25th Anniversary of the Aegean Campaign; Now Engaged in Rearguard Battles on the Same Ground

In the midst of the World War, on April 25, 1916, Australian and New Zealand troops landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula in the Aegean Sea, assisting British forces in bloody battles and establishing meritorious service. Now, ANZAC troops are again engaged in rearguard battles near the Thermopylae Pass in Greece, not far from the Gallipoli battlefield.

Offering Flowers and Prayers: Solemn and Respectful

Australian and New Zealand nationals in Shanghai, commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Gallipoli landing yesterday, went to the Bund War Memorial at 8:30 AM to lay wreaths, observed a minute of silence, and remembered the soldiers who died in the World War, especially in the Gallipoli campaign. A pastor presided over a brief prayer service. Those presenting wreaths included Mr. Bowden, the Australian Government's Trade Commissioner to China, Lieutenant Colonel Mann, representative of the Shanghai ANZAC Association, Lieutenant Colonel Curtis and Major Hamilton, representatives of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, and several U.S. buglers who played military tunes. Representatives from various British groups in the city and a small detachment of British sailors also attended. The ceremony was solemn and respectful, concluding in a light drizzle. Traditionally, a grand commemorative meeting is held every year on this day, but this year, like last year, it was canceled due to the European war.

### Entire Xu Family in Pudong Murdered by Robbers

Xu Wenhuan and Xu Wenlan, two brothers from Yangjia Town in Pudong, possessed considerable wealth. They operated the Hengshun Flower Shop, a rice store, and a general merchandise shop in the town, and recently hoarded kerosene. Their home was in the town. Around 9 PM on the 21st of this month, several bandits broke into the Xu residence, killing the two Xu brothers and Wenhuan's wife. All cash and valuables were looted, and before leaving, the bandits destroyed all the furniture in the house. The robbers escaped with their loot, worth tens of thousands [of dollars]. After the incident, family members discovered what had happened and reported it to the local authorities, who are now searching for the perpetrators. It is said that Xu Wenhuan had considerable influence in the town, in addition to running his shops, he served as the head of the security corps. According to some, this robbery-murder case is different from ordinary robberies, as the robbers not only stole property but also destroyed the furniture in the house, suggesting they had other intentions.

### Righteous Man, Butfans, Suddenly Disappears

### Spring Cocoons Nearing Market: Silk Reeling Factories Prepare to Resume Production

Shanghai silk reeling factories have mostly reduced or suspended operations since the winter of last year due to difficulties in transporting raw materials and the decline in overseas raw silk trade. With the spring cocoons soon to be on the market, silkworm farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are selling their stored dry cocoons, and a few have been transported to Shanghai. Consequently, several factories have recently reopened. The hatching of spring silkworms has begun in various regions. According to estimates from the silk reeling industry, if the weather is favorable, the harvest of spring silkworms from Jiangsu and Zhejiang alone will exceed twenty [thousand] piculs.

### French Avenue Bund: Vietnamese Police Officer Robbed of Gun; Call for Assistance Leads to Capture of One Bandit Shot; Six Robbers in Pingji Road Case Captured

At 5 AM yesterday, a Vietnamese police officer, No. 158, from the French Concession's Meilan Police Station, was on duty in front of No. 25, opposite the French Consulate on French Avenue near the Bund, when four bandits suddenly rushed up, threatened him with guns, and robbed him of his service pistol worn on his waist. They fled eastward towards the Bund. After being robbed of his gun, the Vietnamese police officer shouted for help, blew his whistle, and called for assistance from other police officers. Hearing the call, patrol officers on duty in front of the French Consulate helped chase the bandits and opened fire. The bandits also opened fire to resist arrest. Over ten shots were exchanged, resulting in one bandit being shot and captured. A pistol was recovered. The remaining bandits escaped with the stolen pistol. The patrol officers took the wounded bandit back to the police station and then to the hospital for treatment. The French Police have dispatched detectives to apprehend the remaining fugitives and bring them to justice.

Pingji Road

Cai Wenyuan, a native of Pudong and an employee of the Fuxing Foreign Firm, lived at No. 1 Yongkang Lane, at the intersection of Lafayette Road, and rented his three-story house to the family of Li Caijie, who worked at the Jianghai Customs. At 9 AM yesterday, six bandits broke in, one guarding the back door and five entering the house. Two held Mauser pistols, one held a handgun, and two were unarmed.

Rushing Upstairs

They first searched Cai Wenyuan's home and then went upstairs to search Li Caijie's room, taking about half an hour. Neighbors of the victims became aware of the situation and secretly reported it to the French Police, who dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and Western detectives in police vehicles to surround the house from the front and back and enter to make arrests. The bandits, realizing they had been exposed and could not escape, did not resist and surrendered.

Surrendered

Two Mauser pistols, one handgun, and dozens of bullets were seized and taken back to the police station for questioning. According to their confessions, the six bandits are Ma Yicai (40 years old), Hu Wenqing (28 years old), Wang Jinsheng (50 years old), Xue Akang (31 years old), Chen Jianbao (38 years old), and Jiang Aping (32 years old). The police have determined that Ma is the ringleader, Ma formerly worked as a staff member at a gambling den in the Nanshi area, and Wang is currently a tea server in a

Gambling Den

It was also learned that Xu Weisheng, a bodyguard from a prominent family, is also involved in the robbery. Detectives went to Xu's home to arrest him. Xu was ill in bed and was arrested and taken back to the police station for joint interrogation.

### Spring Shen Temporary Congee Kitchen Information

The Spring Shen Congee Kitchen at the Huoshen Temple in Shanghai has been operating for three months. The average monthly expenditure is over twenty thousand yuan, with a total expenditure of over seventy-seven thousand yuan. The number of people eating congee is two hundred and ten thousand, and currently increases to over five thousand people every day, requiring a large amount of funds. Although the Price Stabilization Committee provides hundreds of bags of low-priced broken rice, it is still insufficient. A directors' meeting was held yesterday to discuss everything. However, financial resources are limited. Because the Jisheng Society has advanced too much money, and now it is a lean season, it is difficult to stop operations. The consensus is to continue for three months and see how the funding comes in before deciding what to do. Many residents in the Nanshi area are poor refugees who struggle to find enough to eat. Since the congee kitchen opened, many have survived. Shanghai is not short of philanthropists who generously donate to support this charitable cause, which brings greater merit than any other form of charity.

### Letter

To the esteemed editor: I have just read the news item in your newspaper on April 13, which states, "Chenghang Pawnshop Suspends Business After Robbery; Two Apprentices Arrested." I am extremely surprised. After the two apprentices left, their parents inquired with the shop, and were told that they had done nothing wrong, had not been reprimanded, had not interacted with outsiders, and had not shown any dissatisfaction in their work. However, prior to their departure, they had taken several 2.5-inch photos of themselves and repeatedly discussed their travel expenses to Ningbo, and paid close attention to maps, suggesting they might first go to Ningbo and then proceed to the rear. The parents found the shop's account credible. Because the father was related to the shop owner, Wu Huaiqing, he did not press the matter further and only asked for a missing person advertisement to be published. Now, ten days later, a robbery and murder case occurred at the pawnshop, and the parents feel fortunate that the two apprentices' prior departure spared them from disaster. However, news has come that the two apprentices are suspected of being involved in the case. Given that the two apprentices are still children (both under 16), how could they commit murder and robbery? They grew up in Pudong and only arrived at the shop last year. Under the shop owner's guidance, they were usually highly regarded. There is no reason for them to collude with bandits. Furthermore, both apprentices are related to the shop owner. Even if one had a fleeting evil thought, it would not lead to such mutual depravity. To suspect them of involvement in the case simply because the incident occurred after they left, and to arbitrarily slander them, completely ignoring that there was a specific reason for their departure, is to treat them very lightly. It is truly a case of "when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer." If the two apprentices are indeed in the police station, as we are told, the parents have not received any notification and cannot provide proof. However, the detailed account of the Chenghang Pawnshop's suspension of business, the holding of pawned items, etc., while omitting any mention of the date of the apprentices' capture, the location of the arrest, and their names, etc., suggests an intentional slander and ulterior motives. However, the parents dare to solemnly declare to the world that even if the two apprentices face unexpected difficulties and hardships after their departure, they would never commit illegal or immoral acts. As the saying goes, "No one knows a son like his father." Therefore, I specially submit this letter, hoping that it will be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column for correction. Sincerely, Hu Hongdou and Zhu Xingen. 23rd day of the 4th month.

### Weather Report

### A Female Switchboard Operator

— Xiao Yun

In the war-torn England, heroic little stories are constantly emerging.

It's a very simple thing. A female switchboard operator in a hospital, after the hospital was bombed, was pinned under the rubble. But she remained calm and composed, and continued to perform her duties. Most touching of all, in that dangerous bombed area, in that unnatural and uncomfortable position, she continued to answer one hundred and twenty-two calls until someone came to rescue her.

A switchboard operator may be a humble position, and switchboard operation may be a simple task, but as long as she can stand her ground, she has made her greatest contribution. She is as admirable as the soldiers on the front lines.

### Red Candle Tears

— Qiu Sheng

I am a young woman who became a widow before marriage; because after the engagement, my fiancé died.

My sister-in-law is a "widow" after being a newlywed for almost a year; because my elder brother said goodbye to my sister-in-law forever after eleven months of marriage.

My aunt is also a widow, and she is now an old lady in her fifties. But my mother told us: When my uncle passed away, she was younger than us.

Our family confines these three awkward figures.

My parents often praised my aunt's "chastity" in front of us, especially in front of my sister-in-law. I don't know what they meant.

Logically, my aunt should be happy to receive praise from others; but she wasn't — she often leaned against the door, looking at the sky, sighing at the white clouds; she never wanted to talk about my uncle; she would also cry when she saw my sister-in-law crying. It is said that my aunt and uncle were only husband and wife in name, and she still does not clearly remember what kind of person her husband was.

Before my aunt married, my uncle had already been suffering from lung disease and had been bedridden for more than half a year; I don't know how many famous doctors had been consulted. But responding to the proverb that "a true illness has no cure," medicine ultimately failed to cure my uncle's illness.

Parents' love for their children is meticulous; but humans are also selfish animals. Although my uncle was already terminally ill, my grandparents still held on tightly to their dying son, trying their best to find a glimmer of hope for their son to be resurrected, without hesitating to make any sacrifices. Although such an attempt was very dangerous; it would sacrifice someone else's child.

The superstitious atmosphere in my hometown is very strong. When people get sick, they first seek gods and ghosts, then ask a doctor, and some even only seek gods and ghosts and do not ask a doctor, and they do not realize it even when the patient dies. "Chongxi" (warding off bad luck with a joyful event, usually a wedding) is a product of superstition, and my aunt's lifelong happiness was ruined by "Chongxi."

It — "Chongxi" is simply a man-eating demon, it ate up my aunt's youth. In the past, it has chewed up countless figures like my aunt, and now it is still opening its bloody mouth and attacking weak women, and no one dares to break it, because it has the latent power of tradition.

My uncle was so seriously ill that, according to many people, it was "bad luck," and "bad luck" could be dispelled by "joyful energy." Just think: a young patient, so seriously ill, and sick for so long, has no time for joy! But even if a person is dying, a "wedding night" is still the greatest celebration in life, and there are no legal regulations prohibiting a patient from getting married, and even if there were, it would not be very effective in a remote village. In my hometown, even ghosts can get married, let alone a patient who is not dead! So my grandparents were busy preparing for my long-ill uncle's wedding. They wanted to use the "joyful energy" of the marriage to dispel my uncle's "bad luck."

Probably the "joyful energy" could not defeat the disease demon, so it offended the "bad luck" instead! Otherwise, how could my uncle's illness suddenly worsen on the night of the wedding? My uncle's sick body made it difficult to perform the solemn wedding ceremony, but people are worthy of being "the spirit of all things," and in such a situation, my grandfather came up with the idea of: "The younger sister will temporarily stand in for her elder brother." So my younger aunt stood in for her elder brother and sister-in-law in the hall to perform the wedding ceremony. The so-called "wedding night" was just the new bride accompanying the dying groom, and watching the red candle that was shedding tears for others, sighing softly.

This is called "Chongxi," but what is "chong" is not "joy!" In less than half a month, my uncle parted ways with his newly married aunt. My young aunt became what the world calls a widow. She has been a widow for more than thirty years!

On the evening of Children's Day, which was also the day before Qingming, my second brother and second sister-in-law took the two children out. My father hadn't returned from work yet, and my mother had gone to the street to buy goods for tomorrow's ancestral sacrifices. The house was quiet, and I saw my sister-in-law lying on the bed crying again. For some reason, my sister-in-law has been more sentimental recently. Whether in a lively gathering or in a quiet home, she often cries secretly. Last time, after attending the engagement banquet of my third brother, she hid in her room for no reason and cried all night. Once, my sister-in-law and I returned to our hometown for some business. On the way, we met an unfamiliar young woman, probably also a widow, crying for her husband next to a coffin in the fields. My sister-in-law also cried with her. Maybe she was sad for my elder brother; but I must have been resenting that man-eating "Etiquette!"

My elder brother has been dead for seven years! But she is still very young, only twenty-six years old this year. She is like a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment, imprisoned in our "family of scholars," she has lost her laughter forever, and is allowing suffering to destroy herself.

The day before yesterday, my father's friend got married. This old groom asked my father to ask me to play the piano. He is already in his forties this year, and this marriage is already his second remarriage. When a "string" breaks, it can be "continued," so what about when a "pipa" breaks?

(7) Draw a Cross on the Face

Qiu Haitang had followed the nanny inside to see his daughter, leaving Yu Kun alone in the outer room.

On a narrow strip of cream-colored wall between two French-style long windows, a small mirror frame, six or seven inches wide, had recently been added, and inside was a lively and lovely photograph of a little girl. On one side, in blue ink, were the six delicate characters "Meiying, taken at two years old," in a woman's handwriting.

Yu Kun casually threw the Shandong silk coat onto a wicker chair on the left, and then stood in front of the mirror frame with his hands behind his back, carefully studying it.

"Looking at Meibao's appearance, she is a rare beauty. Looking closely, she is half like her mother and half like her grandfather; if even one part looks like me, this little treasure will be completely ruined...!" He thought to himself, and a mischievous smile appeared on his face. A twenty-seven-year-old, still like a child.

Suddenly, the door of the bedroom next to the balcony opened, and someone came out.

"Why are you here again today?"

It was the mute maid from Xiang Qi's house, who often came here to help them with some things and keep the nanny company.

She was holding a bedspread that had just been changed, intending to take it downstairs to wash it. When she saw Yu Kun, she smiled at him in a simple way. Yu Kun remembered that she was a bitter melon who was born unable to hear or speak.

"Ah, that's not right!! This child comes here too often, and doesn't know how to avoid people. Be careful this thing is ruined by her! "A terrible idea suddenly came into Yu Kun's head. "I must tell the third sister later and tell her not to move around these days, it is better to hire another old nanny to help." (91)

### Lame and Carefree

— Zhi Hui

In the recent field of medicine, X-rays have gained a new application; this good news is especially for the lame.

The Radiological Society of North America recently held a meeting in the United States, and several of the latest findings became the topic of the meeting, including the method of treating lameness with X-rays.

The causes of lameness include bone tumors, infantile paralysis (the famous President Roosevelt nearly lost his life to infantile paralysis), and congenital defects, which cause the growth of one leg to stagnate while the other leg continues to develop. As a result, a lameness of one high and one low is formed.

When surgeons treat lameness, if the difference in length between the patient's legs is within five inches, bone grafting can be used to shorten the longer side and lengthen the shorter side, so that the height of the legs is equal when they touch the ground, and there are no flaws in appearance.

Dr. Davis Spangler of Dallas, USA, has recently invented a method that has completely overturned the aforementioned old surgical procedure. The old surgical procedure was obviously a palliative treatment, while his is a radical cure; the old method can only be used to cut long and make up for short, while his method is to fundamentally prevent the healthy leg from growing too long from the very beginning. This Texas expert has used four lame children for his theoretical experiments in the past. He exposed the normal leg of each of them to X-rays for a long, long time, (it is said that this effect is the same as the inability of organs to develop when humans take rest for cancer), so that its development cannot be longer than the other crippled leg; the end of his experiment was successful, and his theory was finally proved by facts.

### American Film Industry Policy

Strategies for Coping with Extraordinary Times

In today's world, where the global situation is extremely turbulent, with flames of war raging and a sense of unease everywhere, both industry and commerce have suffered tremendous blows, almost coming to a standstill. Although the film industry holds a firm and lofty position in culture and entertainment, it is currently, at the very least, under severe threat, dealing a fatal blow to progress. The tenth decade [of the 20th century] is like a crisis for the American film industry, just as the twenties were a crisis for American agriculture, and the thirties were a crisis for American industry.

The development of the American film industry holds the reins of the world's film industry. Whether it is in capital, actors, techniques, etc., almost no country can compete with it. Therefore, with the passage of time, the impact felt is also the most profound for the United States. The world film market has been almost entirely lost. Europe and Asia, the two largest places for dumping American products, have also fallen into war. The deteriorating situation has given the United States a sense of being surrounded by thorns.

In this situation, the predicament of the American film industry has always been quite difficult. For the sake of the "bread and butter" of employees, if work were to stop, the chaotic and anxious situation is imaginable. Therefore, in order to safely weather the current difficulties, everyone related to the film industry is racking their brains to plan coping policies and strategies.

In the discussions among film industry giants, they unanimously believe that only by improving the quality of film production can they attract a large number of domestic audiences, bringing the 15% who never watch movies and the 30% to 40% who only watch movies once a month into the cinemas. This is a good strategy of "losing in the east and gaining in the west" to compensate for the loss of income in the lost markets.

In order to improve the quality of film production, "old clichés" and "formulas" are no longer allowed in terms of scripts. Under this "serious production" film production policy, literary films and biographical films have emerged in response. In the past, famous and excellent literary films such as "Gone with the Wind", "Waterloo Bridge", "Random Harvest", "Rebecca", "Waterloo Bridge", "The Grapes of Wrath", and "Waterloo Bridge", etc. Biographical films such as "Sergeant York", "Foreign Correspondent", "Man Hunt", "The Mortal Storm", "Young Mr. Lincoln", "Edison, the Man", "Young Tom Edison", "Edison, the Man", "A Dispatch from Reuters", etc., have all had great success. Taking last year as an example, literary films were first, comedies second, adventure films and biographical films third, and musicals fourth.

Although many lower-level song and dance films and slapstick comedies have been produced during this time, we can say that although movies are art, the element of entertainment must also be included. In this depressed era, entertainment and leisure are not necessarily entirely undesirable. Lighter films may allow people to relax, but the main thing is, of course, movies with profound meaning that can meet the needs of the times.

As for continuous films such as "The Hardy Family", "Little Women", "The Saint", "Asta", "The Shadow", "Dr. Kildare", etc., although they still belong to "B-movies" in terms of cost, the quality of production must be improved. And with the improvement of the level of "B-movies", it is not known whether the "double feature system" will be cancelled in the future; it is only a matter of time and when it will be implemented.

### Diana Durbin's Wedding Plans

— Qinghui

Diana Durbin's marriage issue has been a sensation for more than a year, and now it has finally been decided. It will be held in June of this year. Now that the wedding date is near, and Durbin is a cautious person, she has a complete plan for the new house equipment and the future of her career.

According to Durbin, since deciding on the wedding date, she has bought a large courtyard on Beverly Hills, with a swimming pool, tennis court, and more than one acre of open space. She believes this is the paradise she and her fiance Paul have dreamed of. Not far from there, there is a Christian church, and they want to hold their wedding in this church.

The courtyard has a low white building in the style of southern California, which is very different from the French style. Entering through the huge wall gate is a small courtyard. At first glance, you see a large living room. Walking inside gives you a comfortable feeling. All the decorations are pleasant, and the hall is bright. Mirrors are attached to the corners, which makes the hall even larger and brighter. Opposite is a glass door, and the scenery in the garden can be seen at a glance. The chairs are wide and deep, but the tables are exquisite and delicate. Everything in the room is beautiful and pleasing to the eye.

Upstairs, the first room is the future Paul's study, which is indeed exquisite. The room is small and comfortable, and its width is enough to make the warmth of the fireplace reach the four corners. Many antiques are displayed in the room. Following to the left is a very exquisite nursery, because Durbin's plan includes children. She believes that marriage is not complete without children, and Paul also loves children very much.

In addition, Durbin will have a cook because she doesn't like cooking; Paul likes dogs, so there should be an exquisite dog house in their new home. They should also hire two chauffeurs. She and Paul each have a large car. Durbin only recently learned to drive. She also wants to build a complete ranch, and all the designs are very modern, but it should give people a sense of barbarism there. She has been looking for this place for a long time, and has not found a suitable address yet.

As for the future of her career, Durbin replied frankly, "Money is not what I need most now, so I don't need to worry about it. I want to live a human life, a free and happy life. From now until the wedding, we have no free time to be together. Every minute of being busy before could make me happy, but now nothing can make me happy except being with Paul. However, in terms of work, I still bear my due responsibility. I used to live in a fog, but now I thank God for waking me up and guiding me to the path of light."

Really, Diana Durbin is now working down to earth. The company cannot restrain her, and marriage will increase her happiness. She will have a balanced, fulfilling, free and happy life, and will no longer be busy in the studio all day long. Even if she loses her excellent reputation, she has gained a healthy body, a happy family, and a lovely husband. Look, Diana Durbin's front is still hanging with that colorful rainbow!

### Abstract of the Philosophy of Diligence

— Zong Yu

Quiet is the preparation for movement, and the effectiveness of preparation lies in improving the results of movement. Therefore, quiet cannot be separated from movement and stand alone. Independent quiet is the worst thing. Quiet that is connected with movement is originally one and two with movement.

### Blood Stained Garden

Chapter 7: Why are Attacking Cities and Killing Generals So Chaotic?

Hongniang turned to look at Li Xin and said, "Now, are you willing to go to the mountain with us?" Li Xin said, "Please let me go home and take a look, and then I will go with you." Hongniangzi smiled and said, "You still can't bear to leave your manor. I will accompany you on a trip." So she said to Tong Tianbao, "Brother, we have rescued the young master and obtained the corrupt official's gold and silver, so this trip is not in vain. We will follow the young master's wishes and not harm the people of Qi County. You guys go back to the mountain first, and I will accompany him to the manor and then go back." Tong Tianbao nodded and said, "Very good, I can go back first. Sister, be careful of everything and come back quickly." He also said to Li Xin, "Mr. Li, please don't let down my sister's kindness again." Li Xin didn't know what to say, and smiled slightly. Hongniangzi then took dozens of young men and accompanied Li Xin, rushing to the Li family manor. When Li Xin arrived at the manor, it was already dawn, and a round red sun had emerged from the ground. The gate of the manor was still quietly closed. Li Xin asked Hongniangzi and others to open the gate and went in, grabbing a villager. The villager was surprised to see Li Xin, and cried out, "Master Li." Li Xin asked him, "Do you know where my wife is? Is she still in the manor?" The villager replied, "Since Master Li was captured by the magistrate of Qi County and imprisoned in jail, Fang Pangzi accompanied the county yamen runners to search the house. Most of Master Li's family property was confiscated, and the rest was plundered by Fang Pangzi into his private pocket. He also used words to threaten the madam. It's a pity that the madam hanged herself in her room that day. Now, Fang Pangzi has hastily collected the body and sent the coffin to the ancestral hall." Hearing this news, Li Xin felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over his head, and he stamped his feet and sighed, "Oh, I have implicated my wife in a miserable death, how can I bear it? It's all that dog's head that has caused my family to be destroyed, and I must not spare him." So he asked the villager where Fang Pangzi was now. The villager replied, "After the master had this trouble, the guests in the manor scattered. Fang Pangzi acted arbitrarily and took everything for himself, as if he had replaced the master of the manor. Some villagers who were unwilling to live under him have left one after another. Only a few of us who have nowhere to go are still living here. Fang Pangzi, however, lives openly and unashamedly in the master's room with the maid Guiqiu, seeking his pleasure." Listening to this, Li Xin gritted his teeth and ran with Hongniangzi straight to his own building. He saw Fang Pangzi and the maid Guiqiu, disheveled, running hurriedly to the stairs. It turned out that they had heard the noise outside and knew that the situation was not good. They hurriedly got up from the bed and wanted to escape, but they didn't expect to be caught. Li Xin grabbed Fang Pangzi and shouted, "Kneel down!" Fang Pangzi, seeing the people in the middle, was so frightened that he couldn't speak. He knelt down with a thud, and kept begging for mercy. Guiqiu also knelt down. (48)

### Lu Ming Goes to Hong Kong

— Lan Yu

Miss Lu Ming will be going to Hong Kong recently. It is said that her sister is among those returning. They originally lived together at a certain number in Mingde Lane next to the Jinmen Grand Theater on Fuxu Road. There are many new and old furniture in the apartment, which of course cannot be taken with them, so it has been decided to lease the house and furniture at the same time. It is said that the lease fee is 30,000 yuan. However, I don't know the reason why Miss Lu Ming is leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong!
