### England, America, and the Soviet Union to Cooperate in Preventing Japan's Southern Advance

International News Agency, Washington, 12th: Diplomatic circles here predict that if Japan advances southward, England, America, and the Soviet Union may cooperate closely. It is widely believed that President Roosevelt had a lengthy meeting with Soviet Ambassador Oumansky on Thursday, presumably to discuss various possible changes in the Far East, including the Soviet Union's role in the event of new Japanese actions. However, reports indicate that the meeting primarily aimed to accelerate aid to the Soviet Union. The State Department's public statements have not provoked Japan, but the aid plan for the Soviet Union is reportedly being effectively accelerated. Regarding military supplies, it is generally acknowledged that the United States, in providing them to the Soviet Union, will not compromise its national defense program or aid to England plan.

### German-Soviet War Enters Second Phase: Soviet High Command Reorganized; Three Pillars of the Red Army Appointed Front Commanders; Eight Million Soldiers Deployed to the Front Line for a Decisive Battle

TASS, Moscow, 12th: The Soviet Defense Committee, recognizing that the front is now divided into three lines, has specially ordered the Supreme Command to establish three command headquarters to expedite the defeat of the enemy: (1) Marshal Voroshilov has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Northwest Command; (2) Marshal Timoshenko, Chairman of the Defense Committee, has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the West Command; (3) Marshal Budyonny has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Command.

Reuters, London, 12th: Moscow Radio announced last night that Generals Voroshilov, Timoshenko, and Budyonny have been appointed as Commanders-in-Chief of the Northwest, West, and Southwest sectors of the front lines, respectively, and have already taken office. These three generals are the three pillars of the Soviet defense organization. Voroshilov was appointed Chairman of the Defense Committee on August 7, 1940, and a member of the Defense Council on July 1st of this year. Timoshenko succeeded Voroshilov as Chairman of the Defense Committee on July 8th of this year. General Budyonny is the Chief of Cavalry of the Red Army, having made great contributions during the Civil War. He was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Defense Committee on August 16th of last year.

Reuters, London, 12th: It is reported that the commanders of both the Soviet and German armies are taking advantage of the lull before the storm to deploy fresh troops to the front lines. Ankara Radio broadcast recent news from Moscow stating that the Soviet Union has recently mobilized no less than eight million troops, who are now heading to the front lines. London believes that a new German offensive is about to begin, and the current lull may be due to the exhaustion of German tank crews.

Reuters, London, 12th: In the past thirty-six hours, there have been no major changes on the Eastern Front. The Soviet troops under the command of the three headquarters are now preparing for the second phase of the war. It is reported that the head of the Soviet Information Bureau, Mr. Lozovsky, told reporters that the situation would become clear within three weeks. According to Moscow Radio, Red Army reconnaissance teams infiltrated behind enemy lines and obtained valuable documents when they attacked a German headquarters.

Reuters, London, 12th: The "Daily Telegraph" commented on the current state of the German-Soviet war lull, saying that there is ample reason to believe that the next phase of this great war will be even more intense than the first. Although the aggressors may be inclined to retreat, they cannot afford to back down now. The consequences of the risks they are now taking are either victory or utter defeat. This large-scale war cannot end with a return to the status quo. If Germany fails, the dream of Nazi domination of the world will collapse. The labor and financial costs of this war are difficult to estimate. Therefore, Britain feels morally obligated to redouble its efforts to bomb German ports, industrial centers, and transportation routes while the German-Soviet war is still undecided.

Reuters, London, 12th: The Soviet Information Bureau recently issued a bulletin stating that on the evening of July 11th, there were no changes in the positions of our troops on all fronts. Our air force continued to strike enemy tank columns and motorized and mechanized units. Enemy airfields and the Ploesti oil fields in Romania were also bombed by our aircraft. On July 11th, our air force shot down a total of sixty-five enemy planes, and nineteen of our planes went missing. According to Soviet Information Bureau Deputy Director Lozovsky, the Germans have used poison gas in some areas, and we have not yet retaliated. We made this warning in the bulletin of June 25th.

United Press, Moscow, 12th: Last night's communiqu√© was very brief, similar to the previous night's, indicating that the massive offensive on the German-Soviet front has temporarily halted. The Soviet army, initially caught off guard and penetrated by the German army, now appears to have regrouped and gathered strength along its old, strongest defense lines, confronting the German army. According to Soviet sources, this line has not yet been broken.

United Press, Berlin, 12th: The "Morgenpost" stated yesterday that the Soviet Union is now organizing a strong new defense behind the Stalin Line. This suggests that Germany has not yet broken through the final consolidated Soviet defense line. The newspaper also stated that Moscow's troop numbers are certainly sufficient and can temporarily halt the German advance, but the German victories at Bialystok and Minsk have sufficiently proven that all Soviet resistance will fail.

### Giant Iron Fist Shatters Illusions: German Offensive Halted

TASS, Moscow, 12th: "Red Star" commented, "The iron fist of the Soviet giant has shattered the illusions of Hitler's soldiers about being 'invincible' and 'lightning-fast.' The world must now learn from Germany that Red Army soldiers do not fear so-called 'breakthrough' and 'pincer' tactics. They will not waver or be discouraged. We know the enemy well, and we also know the enemy's tricks well. The enemy is still trying to make a desperate gamble, but its 'invincibility' has been shattered, and the enemy has tasted the great power of the Red Army."

United Press, Berlin, 12th: The German official news agency stated that the German offensive on the German-Soviet front has been hindered by blocked roads. The German army has been operating on this line for several days, attempting to completely eliminate the surrounded Soviet forces in the Minsk and Bialystok areas. However, because the roads are completely blocked by the piled-up remains of Soviet tanks and other vehicles, it is temporarily unable to advance. It also stated that if the German army wants to continue to advance, it must first move the mountain of war equipment aside.

### Soviet Union Organizes Special Forces, Resolves to Defend Leningrad with All Its Might

Havas, Helsinki, 12th: According to "Pravda," the Soviet Union is currently organizing special forces called "Extermination and Defense Units" to defend Leningrad. Most of them are revolutionary soldiers from 1917-1919. The newspaper also urged the government to eliminate the remnants of the bourgeoisie.

Reuters, London, 12th: Moscow Radio reported that yesterday's "Pravda" editorial reiterated Stalin's statement that the most elite German divisions have been crushed, but warned the Soviet people, "Fierce battles lie ahead. We will not simply harass the enemy but defeat them."

### Enormous Sacrifices in Initial Stages of War: One Million German Troops Killed or Wounded in Invasion of Soviet Union

United Press, London, 12th: Yesterday, the impression here among experts was that the actions of the Nazi army in recent days have been aimed at finding the "weak points" in the Red Army's defense line, similar to Sedan in France. The Soviet defense has undoubtedly inflicted enormous sacrifices on the Nazis in the initial stages of the war. According to sources, there are no signs of a lack of material or manpower on the German side. Military observers say that if the "weak point" can be found and properly exploited, the entire defense line from Finland to the Black Sea is threatened. It is widely believed that a new offensive will occur in the central part of the front line, where the Germans are strongest, apart from the small Baltic states. Key points in the central line include Bobruisk and the Lepel sector. Soviet troops have been transferred to defend Bobruisk and Lepel and have launched successful counterattacks. The situation in Bobruisk is unclear. It is heard that military experts say that the German army has made slight progress in the past few days.

United Press, Moscow, 12th: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky announced that since the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the number of German troops killed or wounded has exceeded one million. (Note: The German government news agency also stated that the number of Soviet soldiers killed, wounded, and captured has reached one million.)

### Large-Scale Encirclement Battle in Minsk Area: Germany Boasts of Unprecedented Victory

Havas, Berlin, 11th: The local radio station has just announced that "the collapse of the Soviet Union is only a matter of time. The victories won by the German army in the Bialystok and Minsk areas are almost unprecedented. Strategy is a great art, and its goal is not to occupy important strongholds, but to encircle and annihilate the enemy. The Battle of Cannae by Hannibal in ancient times, the Battle of Tannenberg by General Hindenburg in modern times, and the recent battles by the German army in the Vistula River basin in Poland, the Flanders region in Belgium, and Bialystok in this war, are all evidence of this. Four hundred thousand Soviet troops have been captured, and the total losses are over five hundred thousand. Seventy-three squadrons of Soviet aircraft have also been lost."

### Abundant Natural Resources: Soviet Union Lays Foundation for Victory

Havas, Chongqing, 12th: The "Central Daily News" today commented on the German-Soviet war under the title "The Soviet Union Has Laid the Foundation for Victory." The article stated, "We believe that after three weeks of fighting, the Soviet Union's final victory is guaranteed. This is entirely based on the results of the battle, not on emotional arguments." It also stated, "Consolidating the defenses of the Maritime Province in the Pacific, preventing Japan from taking advantage of any opportunity, ensuring the American supply line, exhausting the German army as much as possible, luring them deep into the country, and then using the terrain, manpower, and material resources to defeat them in one fell swoop is the only strategy for the Soviet Union to win. The Soviet army has achieved victories on various lines in recent days, and Germany's internal weaknesses have become increasingly exposed. The success of the Soviet army's war has further proven this. The German army will inevitably engage in a desperate struggle, but the Soviet Union's final victory has laid its unshakable foundation."

### President Roosevelt Cables Kalinin Expressing Sympathy for the Soviet Union and Wishing Them Success in Their Struggle

TASS, Moscow, 12th: Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium Chairman Kalinin and US President Roosevelt recently exchanged cables. Kalinin's cable to Roosevelt stated, "As your country celebrates its Independence Day, I would like to ask you to accept the sincere congratulations of the Soviet people, who are fighting with weapons for freedom against the common enemy of progressive humanity, the German fascist rulers. I wish you and the great American people a bright future." Roosevelt replied, "I am very grateful for the congratulatory cable for our country's Independence Day. I am deeply impressed by the Russian people's heroic fight against the cruel invaders. The American people abhor armed aggression, and the friendship between the American and Soviet peoples is deeply rooted. The Russian people are now fighting bravely for self-defense and will surely receive our sympathy and admiration. I hereby extend, on behalf of the American people, my congratulations to the people of your country for their success in their struggle."

Editorial

### Germany's Hidden Worries

Reviewing the German-Soviet war situation over the past week, the main German offensive remains stuck on a line stretching from Ostrov in the north, through Lepel, Borisov, and Bobruisk in the center, to Novograd-Volynsky in the south. This is almost unchanged from last week's situation. News reports indicate that the front-line fighting has even quieted down in recent days. This fact proves that the first phase of the German offensive has clearly encountered a setback. One side needs to consolidate the captured positions and maintain the rear transportation that is constantly disrupted by the Red Army, while the other side needs to replenish or replace the exhausted front-line troops in order to carry out the next offensive. However, at the moment when the German offensive temporarily halted, the Soviet Union has used its strict organizational structure and exerted its extraordinary organizational power to mobilize millions of troops domestically. At the same time, it has divided the long front line into three major war zones, with the "three pillars" of the Red Army, Voroshilov, Timoshenko, and Budyonny, each in command. Moreover, the scorched earth policy and guerrilla tactics announced by Stalin have also played a major role on the front lines. Therefore, not only has the Red Army achieved a stable position on all front lines, but it can even launch powerful counterattacks from time to time, forcing Hitler to temporarily slow down his blitzkrieg in order to re-examine his future battle plans. From the perspective of the anti-aggression front, this can be said to have gained some advantage in time.

Thinking from Hitler's perspective, since he made the bold statement that he would end the war against the Soviet Union in eight weeks, he will have to intensify his operations in the future to avoid damaging his prestige. Moreover, if the German-Soviet war cannot be resolved quickly, then once England and the United States are ready and officially launch a Western Front offensive, the Axis powers will truly face the crisis of fighting on two fronts. At that time, it will not only be a loss of prestige, but also the military advantages that have been painstakingly gained over the past two years will be completely destroyed. Only victory is allowed, not defeat, and it must be a "quick victory," not allowed to be prolonged. If military progress is gradually made, but in reality it turns into a long-term war of attrition like the Sino-Japanese War, then for Germany, which is facing enemies on two fronts, it is still an unsolvable situation. Therefore, it is conceivable that Hitler is taking advantage of the temporary lull on the front lines to actively plan his next actions, and it is also possible to imagine how panicked and anxious he is internally.

First, he will certainly try his best to encourage Japan to lend him a helping hand in the Far East, but the crux of the matter is whether the German army can drive straight in and quickly seize victory. Assuming that the German-Soviet war falls into a stalemate, then the clever and exhausted Japan will certainly have no ability to once again pull chestnuts out of the fire for the Axis powers. In particular, Japan has been fooled by the Axis powers more than once in the past. If there is no definite certainty in the future, how can it and how dare it act recklessly again? At most, it will continue its policy of fishing in troubled waters and further exploit the isolated and helpless Vietnam. As for a formal southward or northward advance, it will at least have to wait until the German army has captured Moscow.

Second, when Hitler launched his offensive against the Soviet Union on June 22, he used the fierce strategy of a full-line offensive. At that time, it was indeed aggressive and seemed to possess immense power. If the Red Army had not been of good quality, the Soviet Union at this time would have long followed in the footsteps of Poland or France. However, after three weeks of impact, Hitler must have realized that this "full-scale offensive" strategy cannot defeat a strong enemy with organization, strength, and abundant reserves. In the future, in order to remedy this, he may have to change his strategy, concentrate his forces to attack several key targets. In other words, instead of fighting along a long front line of fifteen hundred miles, which results in the dispersal of forces and the emptiness of the rear, it would seem easier to concentrate all efforts to launch fierce attacks on one or two important strongholds. It is a pity that time is not forgiving. If Hitler had concentrated a hundred or so divisions of troops on June 22 to attack the Minsk line, the Red Army, caught off guard, would have found it difficult to defend firmly. The German "blitz" units would have already approached Moscow at this time. But if this strategy is to be used today, it is not only difficult in practice to gather so many troops, but also under the conditions that the Soviet Union's mobilization has long been completed and the Red Army's manpower and material resources are infinitely supplied, I am afraid that before the Nazi military authorities change their course, the Soviet side will have already preempted and attacked the lightly defended enemy territory.

Third, Hitler, seeing that the war inside the Soviet Union is in danger of turning into a long-term war of attrition, may he also rashly want to win by surprise, and attempt to "open up new paths" in other directions? From the reports that the German army concentrated on the Bulgarian border in an attempt to invade the Turkish Straits, it can be seen that Hitler, in the midst of being unable to advance or retreat, does have the possibility of taking small countries as meat to save his prestige. However, regarding this, although it seems easy, it is actually difficult in many ways. First, Turkey may not submit, and if it turns its back, its combat power can at least be compared with Greece. Second, the Syrian war is coming to an end, and the British Middle East Army, after more than a month of rest and replenishment, can once again step onto the European battlefield to help the Soviet Union and Turkey resist the war. Third, the cooperation between England and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly strong. Recently, there were even rumors that England and the Soviet Union asked Iran to allow them to pass troops through their territory, which shows that if the German army launches a new offensive in the Eastern Mediterranean again, it will only encounter more thorns and more dangers in the future.

From the above, it is not difficult to imagine the depression that Hitler has felt due to the failure to resolve the war against the Soviet Union quickly. If we add to this the increasingly active attitude of the United States in recent days, such as the US Navy taking over the defense of Iceland, American workers participating in military projects at more than fifty British bases, and American ships once firing warning shots at German submarines in the Atlantic Ocean, all of this certainly made Hitler realize that a terrible "incident" was about to occur on the Western Front. Assuming that in the near future, he really needs to face the united front of England, the United States, and the Soviet Union on both the east and west sides, then even if the entire Axis organization does not collapse immediately, at least the end of Nazi hegemony will be near.

### Hankou French Concession Incident: Vietnamese Police Arresting Japanese Leads to Conflict; Resulting in One Vietnamese Policeman and One Japanese Dead, One Japanese Injured; Afterwards, Four Japanese Were Detained by French Authorities; Japanese Spokesperson Says Situation Could Become Serious

Hankou, early this morning, a conflict occurred in the French Concession between Vietnamese police and Japanese individuals. Both sides opened fire, resulting in the death of one Vietnamese policeman and one Japanese individual, as well as minor injuries to another Japanese person. The cause of the conflict is unknown. The incident occurred at 1 AM this morning. Afterwards, the French Concession immediately closed all traffic, reopening at 10 AM. Four Japanese individuals are currently being detained by the French Municipal Council. The Japanese naval authorities, who have jurisdiction over the area adjacent to the French Concession, issued a formal statement this afternoon, hinting that a serious dispute is highly possible. They strongly denied the French claim that the Japanese fired first, stating that the Japanese were not carrying weapons and were shot at by French Concession police. French officials presented weapons allegedly seized from the Japanese as evidence. The statement also stated that if the French authorities refuse to acknowledge the facts of the case, the Japanese naval authorities cannot remain indifferent. The French Municipal Council requested that the Japanese authorities detain the arrested Japanese, but the Japanese have refused, claiming that these individuals were innocent. (Reuters, 12th)

Hankou. A shooting incident occurred in the Hankou French Concession, resulting in the death of one Japanese individual and serious injuries to one Vietnamese policeman. Afterwards, five Japanese were arrested. The Japanese military spokesperson here declared today that if the French authorities do not unconditionally release these five Japanese individuals, the Japanese side will blockade the French Concession. The spokesperson declared that the Japanese authorities consider this shooting incident extremely serious. He stated that the arrested Japanese individuals are innocent and should be released unconditionally and not treated as prisoners to be handed over to the Japanese side. If the French side cannot adapt and change its current attitude and insists on treating the detained Japanese individuals as prisoners and requiring the Japanese side to accept them, the Japanese side may close all gates leading to the French Concession. The spokesperson specifically convened the press this afternoon to issue a statement to foreign reporters regarding the shooting incident in the French Concession. The spokesperson stated that at 1 AM this morning, three Japanese individuals, after a banquet at the railway hotel, went to the hotel's restroom and subsequently had a dispute with the Vietnamese police. The Vietnamese police called for reinforcements, surrounded the restroom, and opened fire, killing one Japanese individual and stabbing him with a bayonet. One Vietnamese policeman was also shot and seriously injured. The spokesperson insisted that the Vietnamese police fired the shot that injured their companion. The French authorities claim that the Japanese fired first. The Japanese spokesperson stated that the Japanese individuals did not have any firearms and therefore could not have fired the shots. The remaining five Japanese individuals were arrested by the French and are still being held in the French police station this afternoon. To avoid accidents, the French authorities closed all gates of the French Concession after the shooting incident, but reopened them at 10 AM this morning. (Associated Press, 12th)

### Syrian Authorities Issued Ceasefire Order Yesterday; Dentz Ordered to Handle Peace Negotiations as Opportunities Arise; Negotiations Underway

Reuters, London, 12th. According to news from London, the Syrian side issued a ceasefire order at midnight yesterday. Reuters, London, 12th. According to a dispatch from Jerusalem, the Syrian ceasefire order was issued at midnight yesterday. Sources there claim that a group of Vichy representatives passed through the Allied lines last night to discuss ceasefire terms.

Associated Press, Acre, 12th. General Wilson, commander of the Egyptian Central Army, assisted by General Catroux, leader of the Free French forces in Syria, began ceasefire negotiations here today with General Verdillac, representing Vichy. Havas, Vichy, 2nd. It is rumored that General Dentz, commander of the French forces in Syria, is in talks with the Central Army authorities in the area. Although this has not yet been confirmed, official sources say that it is not impossible for the two sides to make contact, as General Dentz has been authorized by the government since yesterday to take any necessary actions as opportunities arise. In short, after the French government rejected the British ceasefire terms, the Syrian issue has moved from the political stage to the military stage. Therefore, if the Syrian French Army General Staff deems it necessary, it can act independently to end the war.

The British Ceasefire Terms Include Eleven Articles

Havas, Vichy, 11th. Regarding the Syrian ceasefire issue, the British government sent a note through the American Embassy in France to the French government. The full text is as follows: "The British Embassy in the United States has notified the United States Department of State that the British government has received a letter from General Dentz, High Commissioner of France in Syria, and now hopes that the United States government will forward the following conditions to General Dentz as soon as possible: (1) The Allied forces have no other purpose in Syria other than to prevent the enemy from using it as a land and air force base to attack the Allied military position in the Near East. When the Allied forces entered Syria, they provided guarantees to the Arab people to maintain their independence. Regarding this matter, the British fully agree with the declaration made by General Catroux. In the future, France will be represented in Syria by the Free French authorities, which must not conflict with the independence of the two states of Syria and Lebanon. The British also support the independence of the two states. (2) The Allied forces have no resentment towards the French in Syria and are willing to forgive their last-ditch battle. There is no intention to prosecute any leaders, officials, or troops in Syria. General Catroux has never taken any adverse action against his comrades who fought against him under orders, and this decision is the same. (3) In order to prevent all weapons in Syria from being used by the enemy, the Allied forces must request to receive them. (4) The French forces in Syria must be allowed to freely join the Allied forces to fight against the Axis powers. At the same time, the Allied forces reserve the right to take steps to ensure that every soldier can freely choose. (5) Soldiers should be given full facilities to understand the current situation and the path to their choice. Those who do not wish to join the Allied forces should be sent back to their hometowns with their families when circumstances permit. (6) Soldiers who wish to join the Allied forces should be given honorable terms. Those accepted by the Allied forces will retain their original military rank and be observed for future performance. Other soldiers will be treated well before being sent back to their home countries. Officers who wish to assist the Allied forces will be given positions according to their original ranks and their salaries will be guaranteed. Conversely, those who do not wish to assist the Allied forces will be sent back to their home countries. (7) Structures such as railways, bridges, radio stations, and oil stations must not be destroyed and should be handed over for use by the Allied forces. The Allied forces have the right to place Syria under military occupation during the war. (8) All German and Italian nationals in Syria will be handed over to the Allied forces for confinement. (9) All warships must be handed over to the Allied forces intact and sailed to the port of Beirut for blockade and must not be sailed out arbitrarily. If required for safety, the Commander of the Mediterranean Fleet may order them to be sailed elsewhere, but they must be returned to a unified France after the war and compensated for any damage. (10) The blockade status of Syria and Lebanon should be lifted, and the two states should immediately join the sterling area. (11) All British prisoners should be released immediately. In addition, according to sources, some British officers have been transferred to France for confinement. Before their release, the British authorities believe it is necessary to confine some supporters of the Vichy government in Syria. It is hoped that the United States Department of State will explain this point to General Dentz when conveying the above conditions. Furthermore, if General Dentz can accept the above conditions as a basis for negotiations, the British military authorities are prepared to cease hostilities and immediately conduct negotiations with General Dentz's representatives. It is also hoped that this will be conveyed.

Vichy Rejects Under German Instructions

Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 12th. The original text of France's reply to the British ceasefire terms has been disclosed. The French government believes that the British demands are incompatible with all of France's mandate rights. France believes that it has a mission to liberate Syria and Lebanon and is willing to grant Syria and Lebanon independence, but when to grant independence should be chosen by France. The British government's declaration that Britain will liberate Syria and Lebanon is unfair. Furthermore, the French government cannot negotiate with General Catroux because he betrayed his country. The French government cannot sign ceasefire terms that are contrary to the interests of its country.

Havas, Vichy, 11th. The French government has rejected the British military authorities' ceasefire terms. The war in Syria is still ongoing. British troops are now approaching Beirut, and the army is in trouble and cannot receive supplies and reinforcements. According to responsible sources here, the terms proposed by the British are "unacceptable both in form and substance." The French government cannot use this as a basis for discussion. The British purpose is to seize Syria at a minimal cost. In addition, France's attitude towards the Catroux faction has long been known to the British. The British request that the Syrian military authorities directly negotiate with the Catroux faction's general staff is naturally unacceptable to the French government. People from all walks of life in France have expressed regret over the British attitude. France has the responsibility to govern Syria and has accepted the war to defend it. The British have declared that they have no territorial ambitions in Syria. If so, why should the British ask France to accept a point that honor does not permit, which is difficult to understand. This is probably also the consensus in diplomatic circles. Some neutral countries, such as the United States, have come forward to mediate between Britain and France, and the Vatican has also indirectly requested an end to the war in Syria, all supporting an early restoration of peace in Syria and continuing efforts to end the war. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources here, the French government has complete confidence in General Dentz, the French High Commissioner in Syria and Lebanon, to take any decisions necessary on the ground based on the military situation and current environment. In this regard, further negotiations between Britain and France are still possible.

Reuters, London, 12th. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that those closely watching the situation are not surprised by the issuance of the Syrian ceasefire order. General Dentz's request for a ceasefire a few days ago clearly indicates that the Vichy forces can no longer resist the pressure of the Allied forces, or that General Darlan's rejection of the ceasefire terms, deeming them unacceptable, was under the instructions of the German authorities. Vichy's rejection of the moderate terms proposed by the Allied forces has shifted the responsibility for surrender to General Dentz and the local Vichy authorities.

Resolution of the Syrian Situation Affects the Situation in the Middle East

Reuters, London, 12th. The Times reported that the Vichy government has rejected the ceasefire terms proposed by the Central Powers for Syria and has authorized General Dentz to continue the war with full powers. The significance of this matter is only that Vichy must handle it carefully to avoid offending the Germans. Whether Vichy's decision is due to wanting to please the Germans or being unwilling to deal with the Free French authorities, the military situation in Syria will eventually force it to surrender sooner or later. The delay in reaching a ceasefire agreement only creates unfortunate results: first, it prolongs hopeless resistance, and second, it allows the Vichy fleet time to escape to Turkish ports. The five weeks of military operations by the Allied forces in Syria seem to be undoubtedly within reach of victory. The immediate result is that the Germans have lost an important base, and the Germans have already used interference in Iraq, which may be further expanded. The potential threat northwest of the Suez Canal has been eliminated, and the entire military situation in the eastern Mediterranean has turned in our favor. It is hoped that negotiations to establish effective independence in Syria will begin immediately, the blockade will be lifted, Syria will be included in the sterling area, and Syria's full cooperation with Britain's war effort will enable it to develop close friendships with the Arab countries of the East. The resolution of many problems in the Middle East will also be made easy as a result.

British Troops Advance Along the Coast; Eight Miles from Beirut

Havas, Washington, 11th. President Roosevelt told reporters today that American workers are building naval bases all over the world, especially in Ireland, thereby fulfilling contracts permitted by the "Lend-Lease Act." As for Republican Wilkie's remarks advocating that the United States should obtain naval bases in Ireland and Scotland, President Roosevelt declined to comment.

### Brief History of the Three Soviet Supreme Commanders

Voroshilov

TASS, Moscow, 12th. Soviet Grand Marshal Voroshilov is the most prominent figure in the Soviet Red Army. He was born in 1881 in the Donets Basin, an important industrial area of the country. He began his revolutionary activities early and worked hard to prepare for and organize the October Revolution. In 1918, when the German occupiers invaded Soviet Ukraine, Voroshilov displayed exceptional strategic skills, organizing countless Ukrainian worker-peasant guerrillas. In 1919, Voroshilov, together with Budyonny, commanded the First Cavalry Army and fought gloriously in the Caucasus and Donets Basin. He and Frunze were enthusiastic about reorganizing the Red Army. In 1925, Voroshilov was appointed Chairman of the People's Committee for Naval and Military Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council. Later, he was appointed Chairman of the Soviet Defense Committee. Because of his outstanding service to the country, Voroshilov was awarded three Lenin Orders and four Red Banner Orders by the authorities. In 1935, he was awarded the title of Grand Marshal of the Soviet Union. In May 1940, he was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee and Chairman of the Defense Committee. He is currently a member of the Defense Committee.

Timoshenko

TASS, Moscow, 12th. Grand Marshal Timoshenko, Chairman of the Soviet People's Defense Committee, was born in 1895. His father was a poor peasant. In 1917, he participated in the revolutionary war. The following year, under the leadership of Stalin, he joined the war against Tsaritsyn. He was then appointed commander of the 4th Cavalry Regiment, defeating the Denikin army. After the success of the revolution, Grand Marshal Timoshenko returned to military school for further study. After graduation, he held various important positions. During the Soviet war against Finland, Marshal Timoshenko made many contributions and was awarded three Red Banner Orders and one Lenin Order. After the end of the Soviet-Finnish War, the Soviet Supreme Authority awarded him the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union." Last year, he was appointed Chairman of the Soviet People's Defense Committee.

Budyonny

TASS, Moscow, 10th. Soviet Grand Marshal Budyonny was born in 1883 in the Don Cossack region. His father was a landless farmer. He served in the Tsarist Russian army for fifty years. In 1919, Budyonny's cavalry army achieved excellent campaigns, defeating the troops of Generals Mamontov and Shkuro. In the autumn of that year, under the initiative of Stalin, the First Cavalry Army was established, and Budyonny was appointed leader of the team. The First Cavalry Army achieved glorious victories, defeating Denikin and other White Guards. After the revolutionary war, Budyonny successively served as commander of the cavalry army, member of the Soviet Revolutionary Military Council, inspector of the Red Army Cavalry, and commander of the Moscow Military District troops. Currently, he is Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Defense Committee. Budyonny has made important contributions to the improvement and technical equipment of the Red Army and its cavalry army. Due to his outstanding combat performance, Budyonny has been awarded two Lenin Orders and three Red Banner Orders. In 1935, the authorities awarded him the title of Grand Marshal of the Soviet Union

### Rumors that the Soviet Union May Move its Capital to Orenburg

Prolonged War More Beneficial to the Soviet Union

Reuters, Tokyo, 12th. The Tokyo Shimbun's New York correspondent reported news from Moscow that if the German army breaks through the Stalin Line, the Soviet government may move to Orenburg, 750 miles southeast of Moscow, or to Sverdlovsk, 800 miles east of the Soviet capital. Soviet observers said that if the Soviet army can stop the German advance, the autumn and winter rains in September may help the Soviet army defeat the German offensive.

### Roosevelt Again Requests Funds from Congress, Totalling Over 800 Million for the Navy and Maritime Commission

Reuters, Washington, December 12th: President Roosevelt yesterday requested Congress to approve appropriations and contract authorizations of $3,323,000,000 for the Navy and Maritime Commission, in addition to the $4,770,000,000 for the Army. The total defense funds requested by the President in the past 24 hours amount to $8,093,000,000. Yesterday's request included $1,625,000,000 in cash for the Navy, of which $400,000,000 is for maintaining and repairing defensive equipment on government-owned or privately-owned ships. Some reporters in the press box interpreted this move as arming merchant ships, but the President replied that this was not the intention. Most of this money will be used for naval vessels to install equipment that can withstand magnetic mines. The government also plans to transfer some private ships for naval use. He requested $698,000,000 from the Maritime Commission to enable the Commission to add many new ships. The message requesting new funds for the Lend-Lease Act is being drafted, but it may not be submitted to Congress this week. The supplementary tax bill has been submitted to Congress, and he expects another tax bill this winter. There will likely be a new tax bill every year. The requested funds do not include funds for repairing British ships. The production plan is now being rapidly implemented, and the funding process must be expanded, so funds are needed now and cannot wait until January next year, he said. The funds requested by the President yesterday stipulated $1,246,650,000 for the construction of 566 merchant ships, $350,000,000 for the acquisition, purchase and repair of existing ships, and $50,000,000 for adding shipbuilding equipment. According to the announcement of the Maritime Commission, the Commission has developed its plan and can start construction in early August. All ships under the new program are scheduled to be completed and operational by the end of 1943, with a total tonnage of 5,500,000 tons. This new program, coupled with those directly ordered by the UK from US shipyards, will deliver ships with a load capacity of 14,000,000 tons to the UK by the end of 1943.

### US Navy Secretary Announces US Ships Dropped Depth Charges to Warn Approaching Submarines in the Atlantic, But Denies Deliberately Firing on German Ships

United Press, Washington, December 12th: A congressman told the United Press yesterday that Navy Secretary Colonel Knox told the Senate Naval Committee yesterday that a naval patrol ship had fired a depth charge at an approaching submarine in the Atlantic as a "warning." Colonel Knox also said that US warships engaged in patrols had not deliberately opened fire on any German warships. The Naval Committee held a closed-door meeting for three hours, listening to Colonel Knox's defense. After the meeting, members of the committee said that Colonel Knox had absolutely and firmly denied the news that the Navy had fired on German warships. It was heard that Knox told the committee that the depth charge incident occurred some time ago. Subsequently, when asked about his defense report to the Naval Committee, he declined to comment. A congressman told the United Press that Colonel Knox told the committee that the patrol warship was reportedly a destroyer. When it heard a submarine approaching, the destroyer was rescuing survivors of a British ship that had been sunk in the Atlantic. The vibration stopped a few minutes after the depth charge was released. It was heard that Colonel Knox assured the committee that the effect of the depth charge did not extend beyond a 100-foot circle. It was heard that the submarine was within 100 feet of the American patrol ship. The incident was heard to have occurred at dusk. The destroyer feared that the submarine would launch a torpedo, so it released a depth charge as a warning. It was heard that Colonel Knox told the committee that US warships did not deliberately open fire on German submarines, but he declined to discuss the new instructions regarding maintaining the Atlantic sea lanes.

US Can Freely Dispose of German and Italian Ships, Britain Declares to the US, Waiving Belligerent Rights

Reuters, Washington, December 11th: The British government announced yesterday that Britain has waived its belligerent rights to the German and Italian ships detained by the United States. This was announced by the British Embassy, allowing the United States to use the 28 Italian ships and two German ships it has detained to replace the American ships that have been transferred to the UK, and to make up for some of the losses of British ships. These German and Italian ships are currently being repaired andÊîπÈÄ† by the Maritime Commission. The British waiver of this right is the result of repeated meetings between Under Secretary of State Welles and British Ambassador Halifax. The British Embassy's announcement stated that, in view of the intended use of the German and Italian ships in the United States, the British government fully approves of the steps taken by the US government to use these ships. The British government also recognizes the assistance that Britain and its allies can obtain as a result, and has therefore waived the use of its belligerent rights over these ships.

United Press, Washington, December 12th: The United States has confiscated 16 Axis ships in the United States that were previously detained for espionage. The confiscation order was executed by the Treasury Department under the Espionage Act of 1917. Previously, there were 28 Italian ships and two German ships under "custody" by the United States. The 16 ships confiscated this time are within these 30 ships. It is also learned that the Justice Department has approved the confiscation.

He will also stay here briefly when he returns to Tokyo, Vietnam, in the future.

Nazi Air Force Losses Estimated at 7,500 Aircraft and 18,000 Airmen

Reuters, London, December 12th: The Times aviation correspondent said that the activities of German aircraft in British airspace have clearly shrunk, leading to speculation about the extent to which the German army, now fighting in Eastern Europe, can maintain its air force in Western Europe. The loss of 2,375 German aircraft in the Battle of Britain was enough to make them abandon daytime attacks. Since the outbreak of the European war, it is not easy to estimate the total number of German aircraft lost. However, the number lost in and around the British Isles, as officially announced, is 3,699, and the number of pilots is 9,000. It is said that the German Air Force destroyed 1,000 aircraft in the French campaign, which is probably an underestimate. The British Navy shot down 328 aircraft, and 426 aircraft were shot down over Germany and occupied areas. The Axis aircraft lost 1,969 aircraft in the Middle East, of which German aircraft accounted for a quarter. In addition, several aircraft with Vichy markings were shot down in Syria, 38 were destroyed at sea, and 56 were destroyed in the Norwegian sky. It has been verified that Britain alone has destroyed more than 6,000 German aircraft, with an estimated loss of 15,000 pilots. The number of aircraft destroyed by the Allied forces in other battles is difficult to estimate with much basis, but from a conservative estimate, it should be 1,500 aircraft. Therefore, the total number of German aircraft lost should be at least 7,500, not including accidents during training and take-off and landing, and damage in air combat. The number of pilots lost should be 18,750. Germany's preparation for war must focus on manufacturing aircraft and training aviation personnel, so it must have a large number of aircraft and aviation personnel. After occupying many countries, the production capacity of these two items must increase. However, the people of the occupied countries are mostly hostile, so aircraft must be stationed to prevent incidents. The 7,000 or 8,000 aircraft lost by Germany may have been replenished with newly manufactured aircraft, which is also possible. However, the British Air Force has been attacking German industry and transportation for more than a year, and judging from the information obtained, the losses on the ground are very significant. Even if the factories manufacturing aircraft are not greatly damaged and can produce in large quantities, it is futile to have aircraft without pilots. Aviation personnel cannot be trained hastily. Moreover, once Germany enters winter, it is often unable to fly due to weather conditions. Since Germany began preparing to attack the Soviet Union, the number of aircraft in southwestern Europe has decreased. Although Germany boasts that it is capable of handling two-front warfare, the number of German bombers and fighters transferred to Eastern Europe by the British Air Force is not small. Furthermore, some of the German pilots captured in recent night battles are young men who have just completed training, and many of the German fighter pilots who resisted British aircraft in daytime attacks in the past few weeks are also young men. Their skills cannot be compared with those of experienced British pilots, so Goering was forced toË∞ÉÂõû some of the more experienced pilots from Eastern Europe. However, a British Air Force squadron leader recently said that the opponents we encountered were not top-notch, or even inferior, but simply rookies. Therefore, Germany's lack of aviation talent is a serious problem, and the war between Germany and the Soviet Union will make it even more scarce. Although the exact figures are not yet known, there is clear evidence that the German army has lost a large number of aircraft and airmen in the offensive.

### Commodity Prices in Occupied Areas Have Not Fluctuated Much in the Past Six Months, Due to Increased Production and Stable Purchasing Power of Legal Tender

Chongqing Economic News: According to statistics from economic research institutions, commodity prices in various categories, except for food, have not fluctuated significantly in the past six months. Taking yarn prices as an example, the highest price per piece has never exceeded the 5,000 yuan mark. Some commodity prices have been able to maintain a balance. The reasons are nothing more than the following points: (1) Factories in the interior have resumed work, and newly established factories have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, greatly increasing production. Some light industrial products can now be self-sufficient, such as matches, soap, and leather, which can fully supply the consumer market in the rear. (2) The price management policy is becoming more and more detailed, and has gradually expanded from partial management to full management, and some partial management methods have also taken effect. (3) Commodity prices in the rear have reached the highest point achievable under the current environment. No matter where goods are transported from within, there are thick profits to be made. In addition, the government encourages the transportation of goods within, and strengthens transportation capacity. The government provides various conveniences for the transportation of certain goods, such as gasoline, cotton yarn, and steel, and the transportation of goods within has increased compared to before, and the reserves are becoming more abundant. (4) The international situation is favorable to China, and China has been in an active position in various battlefields, and is closer to the final victory, and people's hearts are stable. With these four reasons, general commodity prices can naturally tend to be stable. As for the prices of some goods that still inevitably have slight fluctuations, it should be due to the stimulation of food prices. If food prices can be reasonably resolved, then all commodity prices can tend to be stable. In addition, the purchasing power of legal tender has not changed in the past six months. The exchange rate of legal tender against foreign currencies is extremely stable. During this period, the British exchange rate has always been around three and a half pence, the US exchange rate has been between 5.5 yuan and 6 yuan, and the Hong Kong exchange rate has been around 22-23 yuan.

### China to Become a First-Class Power After the End of World War, Lattimore Praises China as One of the Powers, Heroic Fighting Has Prepared the Necessary Conditions, Continental Daily Evaluates That Powers Should Be Revalued After the War

Lattimore, political advisor to Chairman Chiang, made a statement while passing through Honolulu on his way to Chongqing, praising China for joining the ranks of the world's great powers, proving that China's international status has increased. In the eyes of just people in the world, China can fight bravely and resolutely resist aggression, and the work it has undertaken is the same as that of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The English-language Continental Daily in this port commented on Lattimore's remarks yesterday, considering them to be insightful. The translation of the article is as follows:

Revaluing the Status of Powers: Lattimore, the newly appointed political advisor to Chairman Chiang, who is currently on his way to Chongqing, declared in Honolulu on Sunday that "the result of China's four years of fighting against Japanese aggression is that China has become a major world power." In the past four years, major events that have shocked the world have occurred one after another, and the status of various powers must be re-evaluated.

How Can a Power Be Constituted? Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it was generally believed that the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Soviet Union were world powers. There are several factors to estimate the constitution of a power, such as manpower, armament, industrial organization, natural wealth, national wealth, and any other factors that make the country strong. However, judging from the results of World War II, the factors that people estimate the strength of various countries are not entirely appropriate.

Currently, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Germany Should Be the Main Ones: At present, there are four important powers, because they dominate world affairs, they should all be included in the ranks of powers, namely the United States, Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union. Although the strength of these four countries is not absolutely equal, they are still huge countries among all the countries in the world. It is a reasonable conclusion to say that these four countries hold great power in their hands to determine current international issues.

Current Status of France, Italy, and Japan: The performance of France, Italy, and Japan in this world war has naturally raised the question of whether they should be regarded as powers at all. Under the current circumstances, at most, France, Italy, and Japan can only be included in the second-class powers, and of course they cannot be compared with the aforementioned four powers.

Everything Changes After the End of the War: Speaking of China's armed conflict, its achievements are far beyond the reach of France and Italy, and it has made Japan unable to escape from the stalemate. Therefore, it is a very fair argument to say that China is also qualified to be included in the second-class powers. When this war finally comes to an end, the ranks of the powers will need to be re-evaluated. Undoubtedly, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have an advantage, and they can defeat Germany, at least temporarily removing it from the ranks of the first-class powers. It then becomes questionable whether any other Axis powers can maintain the title of "power."

China Will Become a First-Class Power: China has the opportunity to rise to the status of a great power and be on par with the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. China's defeat of Japan, internal unity, utilization of vast natural resources, and development of industry will inevitably enable it to rise to a position of great influence in world affairs. One thing that should not be forgotten is that China's friendly relations with other first-class powers, namely the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, will not only not hinder the improvement of China's status, but will also promote it. Lattimore's indication that China is a major world power is the truth.

### British Tram and Bus Companies to Simultaneously Raise Fares Tomorrow: Citizens Will Walk Instead to Save Money; French Bus Company's Driving Time Limits Are Too Harsh

The British-owned Shanghai Public Omnibus Company and the British-owned Shanghai Tramways Company, citing their business revenues being unable to offset expenses, submitted a request to the Public Works Department (Â∑•ÈÉ®Â±Ä) and were approved to simultaneously raise fares starting tomorrow. Shanghai citizen groups had previously appealed for the implementation to be avoided, but to no avail.

### British Tram Company Fare Increase Notice

The Public Works Department-approved British Shanghai Tramways Company of the Public Settlement, has raised prices before not long ago. Recently, with the increase in living subsidies for employees and the increase in expenditures, shareholders' profits have decreased. They had planned to raise prices, but due to public opinion, they announced a postponement. Now, in view of the Public Omnibus Company announcing a fare increase starting the 14th, they are also catching up quickly, requesting the Public Works Department to approve it, so that it can be implemented at the same time. The Public Works Department also approved it. Therefore, the company issued a notice yesterday saying, "The revised fares will be implemented starting July 14, 1941. All new prices will be posted inside the company's vehicles. This is the notice from General Manager Ewen."

### Company's Reasons for Price Increase

The Shanghai Tramways Company increased tram fares. First-class average per mile increased from 6.37 fen to 9.11 fen. Third-class average per mile increased from 4.87 fen to 7.29 fen. The reasons cited were the continued decline in exchange rates and the impact of the foreign war situation, which led to a sharp increase in various operating expenses, reducing the company's investment profit. Therefore, they requested approval to increase fares, which was approved by the Public Works Department meeting on June 11. The reasons for the China Public Omnibus Company's further increase in fares were that since the revision of ticket prices in December of last year, various commodity prices have risen sharply, coupled with the issuance of subsidies to employees, resulting in a sharp increase in expenditures, making it difficult to cope. Therefore, they requested approval to increase fares. The Public Works Department's Public Utilities Committee conducted a detailed study and approved an average increase in fares of 65.54 percent within a maximum range of 1.5 jiao per mile, effective from July 14.

### Walking is the Best Policy

The British-owned China Public Omnibus Company's price increase (an average increase of 60 percent) is the largest increase in the company's history. Citizens from all walks of life had previously organized groups to oppose the increase in public transportation fares, which would increase the burden on citizens. Now that it has been resolutely implemented, a special appeal is made to all sectors to implement "walking instead of riding" with a spirit of perseverance and hard work, so that the company's price increase will be counterproductive, achieving the purpose of sanctions, and reducing the threat to life. Moreover, the spirit of perseverance and hard work can promote a healthy body and habits, changing the decadent life.

### The Drawbacks of the One-Minute-One-Stop System

The French bus company's one-minute-one-stop system implemented by the company authorities causes drivers and ticket sellers to not open the door at each stop, or to start the bus before all passengers have gotten on and off, resulting in constant falling and injury incidents. Citizens are especially appealing to the company authorities to prioritize passenger safety, abolish the current system, so that vehicles are not restricted by time limits, and drivers and ticket sellers no longer neglect their duties, so that passengers' lives are not treated as child's play.

### French Bus Company Also Plans to Raise Prices

After the British Settlement tram and bus companies announced a fare increase starting on the 14th, the French bus and tram companies have also requested the French Concession Public Works Department to review the price increase. However, the bureau has not yet discussed the request and will submit it for discussion at the board meeting.

### Machinery Loaded on the "Guangdong" Ship Not Yet Unloaded Yesterday

The British Taikoo Company's "Guangdong" ship, which set sail from the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession on the 10th, was detained by the Japanese military when it passed through the Wusongkou. Although the company authorities repeatedly negotiated, they were not successful. According to the Japanese Navy, the ship would only be allowed to proceed after the machinery shipped by Anli Foreign Company was unloaded ashore. Because this cargo had already gone through customs procedures, the request was not approved. As of last night, it had still not been able to leave the port. According to reporters' inquiries with Anli Foreign Company, the machinery loaded on the ship had not been unloaded. The entire case has now been transferred by the shipping company authorities to the British Consulate General in Shanghai, and British Consul General George will take diplomatic action to resolve it. According to Western newspapers, this machinery is a textile machine owned by Anli Foreign Company and is planned to be shipped to the Dutch East Indies. However, the Japanese military authorities insist that the machinery is being shipped to the Chinese rear and can be confiscated. Furthermore, it is said that the machinery was not inspected before being loaded onto the ship, so the Japanese side detained the "Guangdong" ship. The Japanese authorities have not yet inspected this machinery due to rain.

### Kosmas to Visit Qingdao: French Authorities Deny

### Polish Embassy in This City Commemorates the Late President Yesterday: Sorrowful Wind and Rain Recall the Great Deeds of the Deceased; Plain Carriages and White Horses, People from All Walks of Life Attended the Funeral Procession

After the former President of the Polish Republic and world-renowned pianist, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, passed away in New York on the 30th of last month, Polish people all over the world and people from friendly countries, either out of respect for his great achievements in founding the country or out of admiration for his musical accomplishments, mourned in unison, whether they knew him or not. Therefore, the Polish Embassy in this city held a memorial mass at 9:00 AM yesterday at the St. Theresa Church at No. 36 Dazhujiao Street. Although it was a sorrowful wind and rain yesterday morning, the participants were very enthusiastic.

### Solemnly Respectful: Church Decoration Grand and Solemn

Paderewski's portrait was hung in the center, lifelike, making people solemnly respectful. Soon, mournful music played softly, and the ceremony began. Prayers and hymns expressed grief. Then, a sermon was given, and those present listened attentively, the air tense. After more than an hour, the meeting was dismissed in the melodious music. It is estimated that several hundred Chinese and Western people attended the memorial service yesterday. Important figures from the diplomatic community in this city were also invited to attend.

### Participating Figures

Such as US Consul General Lockhead, US Yangtze River Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Glassford, US Fourth Fleet Commander Colonel Howard, British Embassy Secretary General Noble, British Consul General George, Portuguese Minister Li Ma, Danish Minister Collin, Consul Hill, Brazilian Minister Mr. Mi, Spanish Consul General Maldonado, Greek Consul General Yenoraitos, Public Works Department Director General Liddell, US Chamber of Commerce Chairman Marshall, etc.

### Charg√© d'Affaires Presided

Yesterday's proceedings were hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Rosset and other senior embassy officials. Paderewski dedicated himself to the Polish independence movement after the First World War. After the great success, he represented Poland and signed the Treaty of Versailles, assuming the position of Polish Prime Minister. Several years later, he withdrew from politics and returned to his hometown in Switzerland. When Poland was invaded, he made a comeback, serving as President of the Polish Republic. In early 1941, he left Europe for the United States and died of illness in New York on June 30 of this year.

### Appeal for Two Disaster-Stricken Children to Continue Their Education Receives Enthusiastic Assistance: People from All Walks of Life Sympathize Greatly and Contribute Funds; More Than Fifty Female Students Save Money to Help; This Newspaper's Colleagues Prepare to Establish the "Shen Bao Scholarship Fund"

Since this newspaper revealed yesterday that two disaster-stricken children were admitted to Lida School as poor students with free tuition, but lacked accommodation and food expenses, and appealed to society, it has received enthusiastic sympathy and support from kind-hearted people. Yesterday, people from all walks of life inquired by letter or telephone one after another, and donations of 340 yuan have been received. This newspaper's colleagues are extremely grateful and excited, and are even more encouraged to fulfill their long-cherished wish to serve others. We sincerely want to be more cautious and strive to contribute our modest efforts to society. The following is a record of the situation of the kind assistance from enthusiastic ladies to Ni Zhaoqi and Bao Jiazeng for accommodation, food, and book expenses, a visit by this newspaper's reporter to Ni Sheng to see his actual living conditions, and the significance of the preparation by this newspaper's colleagues to establish the "Shen Bao Scholarship Fund".

### Mr. Wang Juerong Takes the Lead in Advocating

Yesterday, Mr. Wang Juerong, a reader of this newspaper, was the first to be moved by the appeal of the two students reported in this newspaper yesterday. He generously donated his manuscript fee of 14 yuan for photography for this newspaper last month, and added 86 yuan, for a total of 100 yuan. He also wishes to donate 100 yuan per semester until Ni graduates from high school. Mr. Wang studies medicine at Aurora University and graduated this summer. It is especially admirable that a young man who has just embarked on the road to society has such enthusiasm for serving society.

### Female Students Save Money and Collect 100 Yuan

In addition, yesterday we received donations from Mr. Hu Minshi of 100 yuan, Lide Hall of 100 yuan, Mr. Chen Junxin of Xin Feng Woolen Store of 20 yuan, Mr. Pu Qiting of 10 yuan, and Mr. Du Bingquan of Sino-American Xiang Embroidery Shop of 10 yuan. Yesterday evening, a lady called this newspaper and said that more than fifty female students were willing to save money during their studies and collect 100 yuan to fulfill the two students' desire to study. In total, 340 yuan has been received yesterday. This newspaper plans to wait until the current expenses needed by the two students have been covered, and hopes that the two students can further encourage their hard work and study, and repay the society a hundred times over in the future when they graduate and dedicate themselves to society. This is what this newspaper's colleagues want to encourage the two students and tell the society.

### This Newspaper's Reporter Visits the Disaster-Stricken Children's Home

After this newspaper received letters from two primary school students from the Shanghai Disaster Relief and Education Center appealing to all sectors for assistance, a reporter was specially sent to the school for the sake of clarifying the facts. Director Chang Youju informed the reporter of the organization of the school, saying that the school accommodates 240 to 250 disaster-stricken children, mostly boys. All expenses depend on donations from all sectors. The first graduating class of primary school this semester has ten students. Except for three who are unwilling to continue their studies and are introduced to jobs by the school, the other seven have all been admitted to various middle schools. Director Chang mentioned the achievements of Ni Zhaoqi and Bao Jiazeng, who are excellent in both character and academics, and showed the reporter their exam papers over the years, which were all at the top of the list. Then, she introduced the two students to meet the reporter. Bao Jiazeng was out for some reason, and Director Chang provided written proof of the two students' achievements. After a while, Ni Zhaoqi entered, greeted the reporter with a bow, and smiled politely. After the reporter asked about his family situation, age, and hometown, he replied that his parents were still alive, and he had two older sisters and one younger brother, but his father had been unemployed for a long time, and life was difficult. The reporter then asked, "If you will be entering society in the future, what will you do?" He replied, "I deeply wish to save money on food and clothing and benefit the general poor." Director Hua said that the two students are usually very rich in national concepts and nationalistic ideas. If enthusiastic people in society provide assistance, they will remember the source when they grow up and will definitely make some contributions to repay society's gift. Another disaster-stricken child in the school, Wu Gengsheng, is from Dachang and has also been admitted to Lida School. He requested assistance from this newspaper with sincere and touching words, no less than Ni and Bao. This newspaper will consider the situation and make overall plans to assist all of them equally.

### This Newspaper's Colleagues Prepare to Establish the "Shen Bao Scholarship Fund"

Since the war, compatriots have been displaced and their livelihoods have become increasingly difficult. Students, who are the central force of future society, often drop out of school midway due to economic reasons at this difficult time, or have no strength to enter school and pawn things to cope. It is important to know that today's students who are determined to study diligently are the pillars of future recovery and society. Colleagues have long wanted to do their best to repay the society for the kindness they have received from society, and they have all come from schools. Even when the standard of living was lower in the past, colleagues often used the family's only financial resources for their studies. Today, they are able to serve society, so how can they bear not to make an effort to appeal for the children who are diligent in their studies but lack financial resources? Therefore, colleagues decided to concentrate their efforts to prepare for the establishment of the "Shen Bao Scholarship Fund", which will handle loan scholarships for primary and secondary schools and scholarships for universities. However, colleagues have limited ability and hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will supervise and guide, and donate enthusiastically, so that the talent of society can be used to achieve success. This is what colleagues sincerely pray for and are willing to earnestly request from society for today's ambitious students who are powerless and without support. All the measures of the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund will be announced again after they are finalized, so that they can be corrected by society. If all sectors have brilliant ideas, please do not hesitate to teach them, which will not only be the fortune of this newspaper's colleagues, but also the blessing of society.

### US Assessor Hermelink Suddenly Leaves Shanghai and Returns to the US: No One Has Been Assigned to Replace Mr. Hermelink's Position; Legal Professionals in the United States Find This Very Strange

US Assessor in China, Hermelink, suddenly boarded the President Pias ship on the 11th and left for San Francisco in the United States. However, the President Pias ship was unable to leave the port due to rain and is still berthed in the Huangpu River. Mr. Hermelink's departure from Shanghai was not announced in advance, nor was anyone assigned to temporarily replace him during his absence, resulting in no one to preside over the US Consulate Court.

### Mr. Hermelink Claims

Before his departure, Mr. Hermelink did not specify how long he would be away from Shanghai, only saying "I will go and come back quickly." This reporter wanted to contact Mr. Hermelink yesterday morning, but was unsuccessful, because after all the passengers boarded the President Pias ship last night, the passenger ferries stopped running, and the telephone lines were also cut off.

### Small Civil and Criminal Cases Will Be Handled by Mr. Lu Deng

Small civil and criminal cases at the US Consulate Court will be handled by Mr. Lu Deng, a clerk. However, cases exceeding a certain limit cannot be tried by Mr. Lu Deng and must be left to be tried after Mr. Hermelink returns to Shanghai. When Mr. Hermelink returned to the country for vacation in 1938, he assigned someone to temporarily replace him. This time, the same procedure was not taken, and legal professionals in Shanghai find this very strange.

### Truck Driver Teases a Woman, Actually Kills Her: Neglect of Duty and Fleeing the Scene out of Fear of Punishment; Handed Over to the Authorities and Sentenced to Four Years and Ten Months

Liu Hanming, a truck driver from Yangzhou working for a Japanese company at No. 615 North Sichuan Road, Hongkou, was driving truck number 23382 at 3:50 PM on the 28th of last month, near the intersection of Huade Road and Weituoma Road. At that time, a sixteen-year-old woman, Yan Zhaodi, was riding a bicycle, with a boy on the back. They were coming face to face. Unexpectedly, Liu had bad intentions and teased her, and drove the truck head-on. The male workers on the truck also clapped their hands and shouted. Yan saw that it was unreasonable and avoided to the side of the road. Liu disregarded the danger and persisted, and his speed did not decrease, causing a disaster, knocking Yan down, crushing and killing her. Liu then drove away. After being informed, the patrol police sent detectives to investigate and transported the body to the mortuary for examination, ordering the collection after the cause of death was determined. Later, Liu was brought to the patrol police by his employer, and was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Patrol Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him for negligent homicide in accordance with Article 276, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and stated the case, saying that the defendant had only been driving for three months, lacked sufficient experience, had excessive speed, and teased women, which caused the disaster. After the incident, he fled without a trace, which is inexcusable and should be severely punished. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was ambiguous. Judge Zhong sentenced Liu Hanming to four years and ten months in prison as a warning.

### Special Martial Law in North Railway Station: Freight Car Catches Fire

At around 2:00 PM yesterday, a freight car parked near the overpass of the North Railway Station suddenly caught fire. For a time, smoke filled the area. It is said that the cause of the fire was that the car was loaded with nitric acid, which was caused by the carelessness of the workers. As a result, a freight car was destroyed. At the same time, a passenger train arrived in Shanghai, so soldiers such as the Constitution, Navy and Marine Corps, and other sentries, were sent out to protect the areas around the North Station, such as Baoshan Road, Qiujiang Road, and Xinmin Road, cutting off traffic, and the situation was very tense. Martial law was not lifted until after 3:00 PM.

### Airplane Crashes into the Sea at the Mouth of the Yangtze River

It is rumored that at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, during a heavy rain, a white-gray single-wing airplane flew from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River over the sea at the mouth of the Yangtze River. The machinery suddenly broke, and smoke came out of the tail, unable to fly high, and immediately crashed into the sea and sank.

### Second Batch of Foreign Rice Arrives One After Another

According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, another batch of the Public Works Department's second phase of foreign rice arrived in this city yesterday. The "Jiangsu" ship carried 22,000 bags, and the "Jinan" ship also carried an estimated 8,000 bags, and it is understood that it will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. The Taikoo Company's "Suzhou" ship is also carrying a large batch of the Public Works Department's foreign rice and may arrive tomorrow.

### Two Cars on Park Road Robbed by Bandits

On Park Road in the Public Concession, at around 11:00 PM last night, two black-plated cars, one numbered 2682 and the other 969, were suddenly intercepted and robbed by several armed bandits, and their whereabouts are unknown. They have not been found as of this morning.

### Impact on Factories

According to a survey by the financial institutions of this city, last month, there were a total of eighteen factories in this city that changed and reorganized, and ten that closed down. However, eight of them closed down due to natural disasters and were not affected by the economic downturn. As for larger factories, such as cotton textile factories, there have been no changes. However, due to the lack of raw materials and insufficient electricity supply, coupled with inconvenient transportation, sales have not been greatly expanded, so most have reduced shifts and stopped work, restricting production to maintain the status quo. However, since the outbreak of war between Germany and the Soviet Union, the source of German pigments has been cut off, and the market price of pigments has been manipulated by hoarding, soaring. Therefore, it is permissible for the dye weaving industry to be the most affected. Currently, the number of factories that have started work has decreased by three-quarters.

### Heavy Rain Yesterday Morning: Roads Flooded

This city experienced heavy rain again yesterday morning, starting at 0:00 AM, which was extremely heavy. By 9:00 AM, the raindrops began to thin out. During this period, the total rainfall was recorded by the Xujiahui Observatory as 39.5 millimeters, which was extremely rare. The heavy rain caused waterlogging on the roads, including Zhejiang Road, Nanjing Road, Guangxi Road, Yinghua Street, Guizhou Road, Gansu Road, Alabashito Road, Wenjianshi Road, Foch Road, Saboshai Road, Alb√© Road, Xujiahui, Shiliupu, Zhabei, and Nanshi, where the water was several inches deep in shallow places and several feet deep in deep places, which caused great trouble for pedestrians, especially on Shengmuyuan Road.

### French Patrol Police Promote Meritorious Officers

The French Concession Police Department promotes and rewards meritorious officers every year during the French Democracy Memorial Day.

Detective Qin Youyu was promoted to Deputy Inspector, Deputy Detective Ma Yizhi was promoted to Detective, and Detectives Zhong Benchang, Wu Wengang, and Xu Jinlong were promoted to Deputy Detectives. Inspector Xie Guangming was also promoted to a first-class salary to show his reward.

### Spring Shen Temporary Relief Soup Kitchen Notice

The Chunshen Relief Soup Kitchen at the Huoshen Temple in Nanshi of this city has been operating for half a year since its opening. However, the soup kitchen has always been a temporary relief measure and was originally planned to close at the end of the month. It is heard that most soup kitchens have been closed. At the Chunshen Soup Kitchen, the number of people seeking food is increasing day by day. At this time of scarcity before the new harvest, there is no livelihood. Every morning, there are five to six thousand women, children, and elderly people eating porridge at the factory. It is said that they rely on this one meal a day to prolong their lives. At the moment, the board of directors has requested the human duty of mutual assistance and will continue for another three months, from July 1st, to take porridge home to eat in order to emphasize hygiene, and to take summer medicine to benefit the poor and sick. However, donations have become exhausted, and the Jisheng Association has advanced too much money, and it is difficult to continue.

### Shanghai Nursery Sketch by Hui

In the Huxi district, where factories stand tall, there is an organization that has been operating for only four months but has already gained the trust of people in the community. It is dedicated to the well-being of the children of workers, namely the Shanghai Nursery run by the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA). The Shanghai Nursery is located within Tongren Hospital on Bailinan Road, where the air is fresh. It currently houses thirty children aged one to four.

The nature of the Shanghai Nursery is entirely to serve the working class with poor family circumstances. Amidst rising prices and crowded living conditions, it is the workers who suffer the most from the pressures of life and are in the most urgent need of assistance. This can be strongly proven by the following two facts: Firstly, among the children applying for admission, the majority are eliminated after a physical examination by a doctor due to lung diseases or contagious skin diseases. Secondly, it is absolutely difficult to find healthy and lively children who pass the physical examination. Most of them are thin and weak, with weak resistance, standing on the edge of illness, unable to withstand any kind of disease. Therefore, during the prevalence of measles and whooping cough this spring, in order to avoid the widespread spread of these diseases among the children in the nursery, they had to be vaccinated early for prevention. This widespread phenomenon of being neither sick nor healthy is mainly because the income of the working class does not allow for adequate nutrition for children; at the same time, mothers working outside cannot provide children with reasonable care. Therefore, the Shanghai Nursery came into being in response to the urgent needs of the working class.

The food expenses (three meals and snacks) for each of the thirty children in the nursery average around thirty yuan per month. Their clothes, shoes, socks, and all other supplies are provided by the nursery. Therefore, the monthly expenditure of the nursery, including rent and staff salaries, totals around two thousand yuan. Until now, this cost has been entirely raised through donations. However, in order to make parents feel responsible for their own children, they also consider the parents' financial situation and encourage them to voluntarily contribute a few yuan per month in foster care fees according to their own economic capacity. But this is entirely voluntary, because every month someone comes to ask that someone at home is sick and cannot afford the money, and some people ask that their grandmother passed away last month and they owe debts, and the foster care fees cannot be paid for several months. In this situation, the organizers naturally do not want to force them. Currently, some of the children are adopted by people who are dedicated to social service. The method of adopting a child is to donate twenty yuan per month. For those who adopt a certain child for more than three years, the YWCA will make a porcelain plaque with the name of the adopter and hang it on the bed of the adopted child as a memento. Among these photos, one is a group photo of five lively and lovely children. These five children are adopted by a lady who is enthusiastic about social work. The last time the writer saw them, they were all sallow and thin, cowering when they saw people. But when I went to see them again more than two months later, they had become lively and lovely children who smiled at people.

All the equipment and supplies in the nursery are carefully selected and prepared under the necessary conditions for cultivating healthy children. The children's food is also striving to be nutritious. The organizer's intention is to try their best to run this nursery in a scientific way, but also in a popular way. Because these children will leave the nursery and return to their own homes after the age of four. If children's living habits are developed in a way that is too isolated from general social life, then these children will inevitably encounter many difficulties in terms of future life adaptation. Now, parents can visit the nursery twice every two weeks to avoid the separation caused by time and space between parents and children.

In short, the Shanghai Nursery has already achieved remarkable results under the joint efforts of one director, one caregiver, four nannies, and other staff. This type of emerging social enterprise requires the joint assistance and encouragement of people in the community in terms of spirit and material resources. I personally feel that we should exert our efforts and contribute money to help it grow, and strive to promote this nursery movement to benefit the next generation of citizens.

### Shanghai Children's Library Held a Grand Opening Ceremony Yesterday. The Interior Layout is Orderly, and the Children are Actively Reading. Director Hu and Librarian Lin Announced Their Future Missions.

The Shanghai Children's Library held its opening ceremony at 2:00 PM yesterday at the library site at No. 13 Dahua Commercial Building on Jing'an Temple Road. Approximately one thousand people, including Chen Qingshi, Huang Jingwan, Pu Qiting, Xiao Zhoukaixian, Chen Zhengfan, Ding Bingnan, guests from all walks of life, and children, attended. Chairman Hu Zuyin and Librarian Lin Chongzhi, among others, extended warm greetings. The Children's News Daily published a special issue. Prominent figures in the city, such as Xu Xiaochu and Zhang Ru, sent plaques. Hongyu Pharmacy donated two thousand book clips to express their warm congratulations. The library has a collection of more than 10,000 books. In addition to categorizing them according to the nature of the books, they are also divided into three levels according to the educational level of the children: high, medium, and low. They are also arranged in color to facilitate children's free selection. Yesterday, all the children who visited had a book in hand and lingered, reluctant to leave. It is also stipulated that it will be open from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day (except Tuesdays), welcoming all children to visit and read freely. The details are as follows:

A glimpse of the interior display: Stepping into the library, one is greeted by books and small desks all around. The innocent children are all actively reading, and with clear catalogs, all kinds of books can be flipped through at will. Portraits of famous people from ancient and modern times are hung high on both walls, such as Confucius, Yue Fei, Sun Yat-sen, and inventors Newton, Edison, Lincoln, and others, with profound implications, deeply imprinting on the minds of ordinary children. There are also portraits of Chen Heqin, who donated a large sum of money, and Zhou Mu, Chen Tai, which are also hung high in order to show respect.

A conversation with Director Hu: Director Hu Zuyin told reporters, "I am very grateful for the presence and guidance of people from all walks of life at the opening of this library. However, I am deeply sorry for the small address and the inadequate reception. The mission of this library in the future is to establish 30 circulation stations in various districts of the city. For homeless children in the streets and alleys, we plan to use mobile library vehicles to serve children of all countries in Shanghai within the possible range. We are now collecting nearly 10,000 children's reading materials, and we also plan to establish a children's reading material editing and review committee to notify children not to read bad reading materials and to edit excellent reading materials suitable for children's psychology. The procedures for reading and borrowing have been ordered in a borrowing rule and plan reading lectures, and will introduce new information to promote them. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the ladies who have supported this library in the past in terms of material and spirit."

A conversation with Librarian Lin: Librarian Lin Chongzhi expressed several of his opinions to reporters, which are excerpted as follows: (1) The establishment of the Shanghai Children's Library has set a new record in China's library industry. Although it has a rough scale, there is still a lot of work to be done in the future, and it depends on the full support of all sectors of society. (2) Compared with the many children in Shanghai, the library building is really too small. If the economy permits in the future, we must build a great library building to equip it completely and meet the needs of the society. (3) Examining the existing children's books, they are all published before the war, and I feel that there is a need for improvement and supplementation. The library plans to organize a children's reading special editing committee and jointly publish good special features suitable for children's needs with the publishing industry to make further contributions. (4) The library will be officially open for reading from today and will also begin to handle applications for borrowing cards and contact matters for the establishment of circulation stations. The lending date should be around August 10.

Children send letters of thanks: Shanghai children Ying Chun Gao, Ying Chun Tong, and other children appealed to all sectors of society last year to establish the Shanghai Children's Library. Now that the goal has been achieved, they sent a letter to the association yesterday to express their gratitude. The words are as follows: "Dear Sir/Madam, Chun Gao, etc., appealed last year to establish the Shanghai Children's Library. We have learned that your association has worked hard to prepare and finally realized the construction of the Children's Library, bringing rich and healthy spiritual food to supply us, creating great happiness for us children, which is really very grateful to us. Now, on behalf of the children of Shanghai, I would like to express my warm gratitude to your association and wish you all good health and happiness."

Issuance of Commemorative Awards: The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Children's Library has now completed the matter of awarding donors. Jinqi was presented to Xu Xiaochu, Hu Guigeng, and Chen Zhusheng, with the text "Cultivating Talents." Plaques were given to Xiao Zhoukaixian, Ding Jianxing, and the Women's Middle School of the Public Works Department, with the text "Enlightening Outstanding People." Various commemorative medals were given to other donors. Photography was also held to commemorate. Awards were also given to other team leaders and fundraisers to express their gratitude. Chen Zhengfan, the secretary-general of the preparatory committee, presided over the preparatory work on a voluntary basis until its completion. In addition to raising 3,275.38 yuan, he also donated 554.35 yuan of charity funds. The Standing Committee decided to express its sincere gratitude and present a silver vase with the text "Benefiting Children" to commemorate it permanently.

Private Yangzhong Moved to Shanghai to Resume Classes

Private Yangzhong in Yangzhou has been established for nearly 20 years, and more than 2,000 students have graduated from junior and senior high schools. In the winter of the 26th year of the Republic of China, Yangcheng fell, and the school moved to Fanchuan, which belonged to Taixian County, to resume classes. Later, it moved from Fan to Gaoyou, Donglizhuang, and finally to Zhenwu Temple in Jiangdu. Although it was repeatedly affected by the war, it moved again and again, but it never stopped classes. Now, because the above-mentioned places have become war zones as a whole, it has recently moved to Shanghai to resume classes. It is now using the old site of Shengyangzhong Building on Xinzhi Market Building, Jing'an Temple, in the British Concession as a school building, and has improved the board of directors and properly settled the fund. In addition to the registration of old students, the new arrivals are very enthusiastic.

### Finance: Japanese Merchants Prevent the United States from Freezing Funds and Vigorously Dump American Exchange.

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed exchanges did not fluctuate, and the black market for British and American exchanges showed a counter-trend reversal. After the opening in the morning, Chinese speculative traders engaged in selling and part-time operations. Japanese merchants' banks continued to vigorously sell, reportedly to prevent the United States from freezing funds. Hong Kong Electric sold less British exchange, and HSBC re-issued US dollars. Gold prices fell again to within 6,600 yuan, and speculators were more eager to sell, so it went straight to the close, with British gold at 3 pence 21875 and US dollars at 5.28125, all showing a rebound. There was a very active transaction today.

HSBC Hong Kong Electric All Sell

Since the morning, the foreign telegraphic exchange market in the US and India has fallen, and the US market has not changed. The exchange rates of various countries have not changed. The bank's selling price opened early in the domestic market. The spot British gold was 3 pence 203125, and the US dollar was 5.25. Speculators were divided on the US dollar at 5.25, and the market situation was slightly unstable. It can be settled at the above price, and then it softened to be sold. HSBC's listing has not changed, and the silver balancing tax is 1.5 points lower, accounting for 23.00%. Japanese merchant banks sold US dollars at 5.25 in July and August, and HSBC also sold at the same price. Moreover, Hong Kong Electric came to sell British gold to Hua Bank in July at 3 pence 21875, which immediately hardened to be difficult to sell. Therefore, Chinese merchants actually competed with Japanese banks to sell US dollars at 5.28125 in August. At noon, it became even harder to buy British gold at 3 pence 21875 and US dollars at 5.28125, which was 0.015625 higher for British and 0.0625 higher for US dollars than the closing price on the previous day.

Hong Kong American Exchange Slightly Higher Hong Kong, December 12 (Saturday) Telegraph: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The spot price of American exchange was 0.0625 higher, at 24.4375 yuan. The spot price of Shanghai exchange was 3 yuan lower, at 465 yuan. There were no other changes.

### Panic Rises on the Gold Market as Short Covering and Speculation Occur Simultaneously, with Settlement Only Cinching One Yuan as the American Exchange Rate Settles.

Yesterday's gold market was extremely difficult to predict. Even experienced operators found it tricky, rising first and then falling, with the price retreating into the 6,600 yuan range. The morale of all parties changed from stable to uncertain. It was heard that Japan was preventing the United States from freezing funds, and Japanese merchant banks repeatedly sold large amounts of foreign exchange, causing the foreign exchange rate to suddenly become loose. Panic rose, and companies like Xinfeng, Yongyi, Yuande, Fuyi, and Daqun rushed to get out of their holdings. Chida and Hesheng added more force to sell. Therefore, after the opening in the morning, Jin Hao Chengji and Dafeng bought in, rising to 6,647 yuan. Later, following the loosening of the foreign exchange rate, it sharply dropped to 6,591 yuan. It was still because tomorrow (Monday) afternoon, from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM, was the spot swap (from July to August). It was heard that the seller would pay the buyer around 40 yuan. Therefore, those who covered shorts were also eager to do so, and the price continued to fall by 30 yuan, not as sharply as the loosening of the American exchange rate, resulting in the settlement price only being cinched by one yuan. The total transaction volume in half a day was 50,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. Cash was sold by Mingfeng to Xianghe for 30 taels, at a price 290 yuan higher than the spot price, also a small 30 yuan, and decorated gold was 5 yuan lower, totaling 710 yuan.

Retreating into the 6,600 Yuan Mark: Since the opening at 9:15 AM this morning, the price per bar (10 taels) was 6,628 yuan, which was 5 yuan higher than the closing price on the previous day. It was decided to be 6,625 yuan. It was heard that the American exchange rate of 5.25 was difficult to sell, and the market situation was boosted. Yi Dada, Dafeng, and Chengji competed to buy in, and the price immediately rose by 22 yuan to 6,647 yuan. Xinfeng, Yongyi, and Yuan sold strongly, and Chengji also re-issued, hovering slightly around 6,640 yuan. At 10:20 AM, the loosening momentum of the foreign exchange rate gradually increased. The number of sellers in the market gathered more and more. Defu, Hesheng, Yi Dada, and Chida sold fiercely, and scattered shorts rose up to short sell. Around the 6,600 yuan mark, the price fluctuated slightly as Hedaifeng, Tongkangyong, and the silver number gang collected and absorbed. It was heard that the near-term American dollar at 5.28125 could also be settled, and the price retreated to 6,591 yuan. The midday closing price was 6,593 yuan, which was 30 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. The settlement price for the July American dollar at 5.28125 was 6,594 yuan, a difference of one yuan. After the closing, Chengji sold small amounts to 6,590 yuan, and Xinfeng Yongjin rose to 6,595 yuan. There was a difference of 56 yuan in the first half of the day. There was no market on Saturday afternoon. The selling price of cash number's gold was 300 yuan higher than the spot price, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for the current bidding gold.

Silver Building Decorated Gold Hangs a Small 5 Yuan: The exchange price of silver building jewelry gold per tael was initially 715 yuan by Da Tonghang and Xin Tonghang, and it was lowered by 5 yuan at 11:45 AM, totaling 710 yuan, and the buying price was reduced by 40 yuan.

American Dollar Has Outflow When High: Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The spot price rose first and then fell. The prices of British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan. The price of British gold notes remained unchanged, and the market price stood flat. The price of American dollar notes opened at 18 yuan and 94 cents. After the opening, Zhenhe, Xinghe, Shuntai, Yongzhi, Chengda, Dachang, and others competed to buy, raising it to 19 yuan and 6 cents. Liji, Chengfeng, Dagong, Lianhe, and others sold off when the price was high. The closing price retreated to 18 yuan and 89 cents, which was a decrease of 14 cents compared to the previous day. The trend of Hong Kong notes was stable, and the market price stood flat. The Japanese gold note slightly tended to weaken, and the evening market retreated to 2 yuan and 2 cents. The trend of Korean notes was stable, and the market price stood flat. The evening market still stood at the original price of 1 yuan and 61 cents. Grain: Rice prices rise, but actual sales return to silence.

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice rose first and then fell, and the market shape showed a circling phenomenon. After the market opened this morning, following the previous day's price increase, speculative traders continued to hoard it for balloon trading. The market price immediately followed the activities of the top palace and gradually increased. The return of Yinghua Company's current and forward goods was the most speculative and lively transaction, and the price immediately increased by more than 2 yuan. No. 2 Siamese was from 145 yuan and 7 cents to 146 yuan in July, and Xiaojiao was to 154 yuan and a half in July, and the current price was 153 yuan and a half. However, actual sales were silent after the price increase, and those who made profits also took the opportunity to sell at a high price. The current price of rice was slightly higher because of the supply of Hong Kong rice on this street, and the inner mainland of the customer gang was blocked due to rain and had no intention of handling it smoothly. In addition, the rumors on the market were proven to be untrue, and the market price immediately fell back in a vigorous selling atmosphere. No. 2 Siamese also decreased to 145 yuan and a half, and Xiaojiao is now at 151 yuan and a half, with a period of 153 yuan and 57 cents. Yinghua Company was also only 800 to 900 tons, and the result was only about one yuan higher than the previous day, and the spot price was only half a yuan in and out, with less than 7,000 bags traded. It is estimated that the closing price of No. 1 Saigon high-quality goods was 132 yuan, 131 yuan, 130 yuan and 5 cents in the middle, and 129 yuan, No. 2 was 1234 yuan, Xiaobao was 118 yuan, special Siamese was 134 yuan, No. 2 Siamese was 124 yuan, the middle was 122 yuan, Mindang was 134 yuan and a half, the middle was 130 yuan, Hefomi was 128 yuan, Xiaowen was 125 yuan and a half, 125 yuan and a half, 125 yuan, and the middle was 123 yuan, and broken tip was 97 yuan to 95 yuan.

The market for thick, thin, japonica rice, national rice, and glutinous rice is generally normal. All depend on the scarcity of goods in the market and the even supply and demand, so the market is not changing. The original plate is guarded. It is estimated that the opening of Nanhang fresh early and late rice is 142 yuan to 140 yuan, Wuxi original packaged white japonica rice is 1356 yuan, old japonica rice is 1323 yuan, Hong Kong Baiyuan high is from 125 yuan, secondary to 121 yuan, Nuolu is 1145 yuan, and Jindan Guoyuan is 127 yuan to 125 yuan.

The sales of powder on this street are slightly moving. The current foreign powder is firm in the morning and loose at noon, and the transaction is very clear. Because of the weekend period, there are fewer customers hoarding in and out. Except for the slight movement of actual sales on this street, there are very few large transactions. Only more than 2,000 bags of Jinlong powder were opened, and the initial opening was 33 yuan and 15 cents, and then it was immediately loosened to 33 yuan. 500 bags of Turret powder was also opened at 33 yuan and 67 cents. There are also 500 bags of Australian powder from Hong Kong under the Bodhi brand that have been opened, and the price is 33 yuan. The quality of this product is said to be good, and the customer gang has the intention to handle it. Other brands are not open on the market. The market situation is loose, and there is no market for wheat.

Oil Cake: Cooking Oil Rises One to Two Yuan

Soybean Cake Sleeve Empty and There are Exports

Cooking Oil: The source is lacking ships in recent days.

The goods are not selling smoothly, which makes the owners quite determined to sell, and the market is rising again. Yesterday, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were sold, 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 70 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 30 barrels of Hankou soybean oil, and more than 1,000 dan of clear oil from this factory. The price was one or two yuan higher than the previous day (price details in the market price column (Soybean Cake: Yesterday, the price was turned up together due to the fact that the empty households had quite a few offsets, and a group of powerful people planned to engage in cash settlement. It is estimated that 1,000 pieces of Dayou soybean cake were sold, and more than 10,000 pieces of Xingshi soybean cake were sold on the spot, and more than 30,000 pieces of futures were sold. The market rebounded by about half a yuan.

Today, 2,500 pieces of soybeans will be shipped to Hong Kong, 250 pieces to Little Luzon, 1,880 pieces to Singapore, 2,000 pieces of soybean cake to Singapore, and 2,060 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Yarn Flower, Cotton Yarn Faces Bearish Pressure, Credit for Each Month Turns Downstream Again

The yarn market has entered a period of fluctuation again. This is due to the unusually active short-selling, creating heavy pressure. At the same time, purchases by the Guangdong merchants are sluggish, not as prosperous as in the past. As a result, confidence is weak and the market is soft. However, those with sufficient capital will come in to buy when prices fall. Therefore, both the bulls and the bears are fighting fiercely. 20-count Double Horse yarn had a high price of $1,573 and a low price of $1,557. In the afternoon, due to the end of the week, there was a lack of transactions and no deals were heard.

Double Horse opened in the morning and continued the momentum from the afternoon of the previous day. The opening price was $1,558, then fell to $1,556. Subsequently, due to profit-taking, the market rebounded to $1,560. This price held for a while. Afterwards, it was heard that although the spot yarn trade in Guangdong was clear, spot yarn prices remained unchanged, and confidence rose to $1,573. However, the market at a certain exchange was not good, selling voices rose again, and the trend turned downwards to $1,558. The closing price rebounded slightly to $1,564. It is found that the trading volume in half a day was 4,600 bales. On the 13th, 2,195 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of yarn bought by each region is listed as follows:

Hong Kong: 100, Peers: 4,500, Total: 4,600

Golden Transformation Horse Futures Yarn. The market sentiment was good at the beginning of the morning, because it had fallen sharply the day before, and off-market merchants bought slightly, and short sellers also covered their positions. July and August rose by $3 to $4.5 each. There were many buyers in September, rising by $14 alone. After the opening, it continued to rise slightly. Later, as the international situation was not optimistic and exchange rates and gold prices remained weak, the bulls started to sell again, and prices went downstream again. The closing prices for each month in the afternoon were down $6 to $8 compared to the previous day. A total of 12,180 bales were traded in half a day, a decrease of 10,020 bales compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the market was closed due to Saturday. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for half a day are recorded on the left (net market prices).

### Cotton Merchants Unwilling to Sell Cheaply, Trade Quiet

The spot cotton situation is that the yarn market is weak, and the momentum is tired, but holders are unwilling to sell because their inventories are not thick and the supply is not smooth. If prices fall, they are unwilling to sell. Therefore, the market is relatively quiet, with a temporary standstill. On the 13th, 150 pieces of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong.

New York Cotton Market: The market is quiet and firm, due to industry buying and unfavorable weather reports for short sellers. Yesterday's closing price was up 7-8 points from the previous day.

Indian Cotton Market: First, it rose due to active short-covering, then fell back due to long profit-taking. Finally, the market rose again due to mass buying and cotton merchant covering. As a result, closing prices were up 4-9 rupees each. Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: The market is quiet and firm, as trading is slightly lower due to slightly suppressed buying intentions from all parties. Yesterday, in addition to factory orders for more than 700 pieces of Brazilian cotton, there were no transactions for grade cotton.

Securities: Government Bonds Rise and Fall Easily, Let's See the Bullish Front

Over-the-counter Government Bonds: Yesterday's market continued to strengthen. Xiehe and Yuanjin's appetite remained strong, causing the bond market to rise again. Class C broke through the $2 mark, while Class A remained weak and listless. The rise was not widespread, indicating that it failed to arouse the interest of the general public in going long. Only Class C showed abnormal development, which also shows that both bulls and bears gathered here, so rising and falling easily is not difficult. The trend still needs to look at whether the new front of this round of bulls is consolidated, or whether it still wants to transfer risk. Yesterday, only one session was done in the morning on Saturday. Class C saw $2 at the opening, and once broke through the mark in the middle, but still closed outside $2. At the beginning, Xiehe and Yuanfu had a large appetite, about 500,000, supplied by Lianhe and Tongshun. Dazhong bought 300,000, spit out by Hongda and Yitai. Others such as Xie Kang, Tong Kang, Xinfu, Yichang, and Dahuasheng all bought in. The sellers were Xie Da, Hefeng, Lianyi, and Runde. The recent trend has been that old longs are selling and new longs are buying. This kind of evolution, near the dividend payment, does not seem to have a flustered situation for the bulls. As a result, it continued to rise by 2 to 5 cents, with a transaction volume of around 200,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were traded at a price of $9.

Piece Goods: Both Cotton Cloth Imports and Exports Are Rare

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market was quiet. Stockholders and peers thought about trading. Both imports and exports were rare. Users with real needs occasionally inquired, but most also adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Sales of coarse cloth and coarse twill stood firm. The fall in fine cloth and fine twill was also suppressed. A part continued to fall by a small amount of 2.5 cents. This street traded more than 200 pieces of spot and future cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants traded nearly 300 pieces of coarse and fine twill and figured cloth. Nanyang merchants traded 5,000 to 6,000 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth.

### My Views on the Method of Exchanging Money Shop Notes

‚Äî Jack

The exchange of notes between members of the money shops has always adopted the method of reconciling public notes, which is very crude compared to the method adopted by the note exchange of the banking industry. There is no shortage of enlightened people in the money industry who advocate for reforms. This year, in order to easily check for numerical errors and calculate the balance of each account on the settlement day, the money shop reserve adopted the "Note Exchange Public Note Report Form" and implemented it on June 2.

The "Note Exchange Public Note Report Form" is 15.5 inches long and 8.5 inches wide. The name of the form is arranged horizontally in three lines. The first line is "Shanghai Money Shop Joint Reserve," the second line is "Member Shop," and the third line is "Note Exchange Public Note Report Form," followed by the date. The table lists the names of each member shop, and the order of arrangement is: Dade, Dalai, Yuansheng, Wufeng, Renchang, Ankang, Anyu, Cunde, Tongrun, Tongyu, Junchang, Jintai, Huichang, Chengyu, Yida, Hefeng, Xinfu, Xinyu, Chunyuan, Yida, Zhixiang, Zhentai, Shunkang, Yichang, Fukang, Fuyuan, Gengyu, Jukang, Zifeng, Qingda, Qingcheng, Dingkang, Zhengxiang, Hengjiu, Hengtong, Hongsheng, Baofeng, Jinyuan, Fuli, Shende, Yihe, Xinzhong, Xinhe, Yonglong, Qichang, Baochang, Tailai, Dunyu, Zikang, Jianchang, Money Shop Reserve. To the right of the shop name is the "Received National Currency" column, and to the left is the "Paid National Currency" column. On the right side of the table are three "Notes": "(1) For the convenience of checking, from now on, each shop only needs to fill in the number of public notes received and paid on the same day in this form and send it to the reserve. The public notes received on the same day can be kept in this shop for verification; (2) Please fill in the numbers in this form clearly; (3) The method of receiving and paying in this form is based on the shop filling in the form." On the left side of the table is "This table is sent to the Shanghai Money Shop Joint Reserve for reference," followed by the place for the member shop to stamp. At present, the exchange of notes is divided into two types: head division and remittance division. Therefore, below the member shop's stamp, the words "head division" or "remittance division" are printed in red. At the bottom of the table, in the line of the Money Shop Reserve, the words "Today's Reconciliation Receipt" are printed in red on the left, and "Today's Reconciliation Payment" are printed on the right, which are used to fill in the difference between receipts and payments. The last line is the total. If the total numbers on both the receipt and payment sides are equal, it means that the calculation is correct.

The "Note Exchange Public Note Report Form" is roughly similar to the "Exchange Difference Calculation Form" of the Note Exchange. Therefore, the adoption of this form is a major step towards a scientific exchange method in terms of the money shop's note exchange method. However, there are still differences in complexity between the two in content: First, the exchange difference calculation form also has a "Number" column and a "Number of Sheets" column for both debit and credit sides; Second, the exchange difference calculation form has four more lines below the total. The first line is "The Exchange Difference to be settled in the Exchange," the second line is "The Total Amount of the First Exchange," the third line is "The Total Amount of the Second Exchange," and the fourth line is "The Total Amount of the Daily Settlement to be Settled." But in terms of method, the current exchange method of the money shop reserve is largely the same as that of the Note Exchange.

The money shop has always been rich in conservative color. Therefore, after this reform, some member shops believed that the procedures were cumbersome and requested improvements. The Money Shop Association convened a meeting of representatives of each member shop on June 17 to study the matter. The opinions raised by each shop included four types: (1) It was advocated that the Note Exchange Public Note Report Form should still be used, and the shops should reconcile the numbers and submit them to the money reserve; (2) Stipulate the time for receiving notes, restore the public note system and improve it; (3) Adopt the exchange method of the Note Exchange; (4) Extend the exchange time by half an hour, mutually reconcile, and each shop issue one public note. The Jinyuan Shop also proposed a draft reform plan for public notes: (1) Organize a committee to determine the note exchange time and increase the number of exchanges; (2) The public note should be renamed the Interbank Reconciliation Accounting Sheet and exchange methods, etc. As a result of this decision meeting, a "Public Note Problem Research Committee" was organized, and nine members were elected, including seven from each shop and two from the money reserve. The first decision meeting was held on June 24, and the second decision meeting is scheduled to be held on July 10. It is not yet known whether the money shop's note exchange method will be restored to the original method, continue to use the current method, or adopt the Note Exchange method. For the sake of protecting the money shop, the author is willing to offer his humble opinion. (To be continued)

Eastern Piece Goods: The market trend is stable. Spot cloth transactions are few. Leading Longtou stock closed at $47.95, up 3.5 cents. Medium-grade fine cloth and twill were flat. Four Gentlemen Serge closed at $1.585, up 2.5 cents per yard.

Exports: On the 13th, 1,070 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, 85 pieces to Singapore, and 175 pieces to Little Luzon. Yesterday, the sugar market trend rebounded slightly. The association's market quotation was: 24 Coarse White Outer Wharf New Goods, $95.8; Old Goods, $93.9. Delivery on the 20th of this month, $96.1 to $96. Taikoo Cart White B Mark, $115.5 to $118. Due to Tianjin merchants searching for goods, the rise was very strong. DY Mark was priced at $104; HX Mark New Goods, $94; Dutch Red, $74.

Seafood: Fennel Stale and Soft

Recently, due to the thick stock of fennel and the very stale sales, the price has been softening. Since entering the $300 mark, there have been few buyers. Now customers' bids are harsh, differing from the market price by more than $20, resulting in few transactions.

Coal: Heling Coal Dust Arrives New, 6,500 Tons

Heling coal dust has been arriving in large quantities recently. It is heard that a certain foreign firm has shipped 6,500 tons of new goods. Although the sales market is sluggish, the cost has not been reduced due to high exchange rates. Therefore, the market will still maintain $220. However, the over-the-counter market has begun to fall due to stockholders selling out, reducing about 10 yuan. Factories on this street have slightly bought in on the cheap, it is said.

### Make Friends with Nature

‚Äî Yang Lingxiao

Little friends, in the subject of nature, it should be the most interesting of all your homework! Because it will tell you the origins of wind, clouds, rain, and snow in the sky, and various natural phenomena. It will tell you about the occurrence and changes of various strange animals and plants on the ground. It will also tell you about treasures such as gold and silver in the stratum, and the principles of electric cars, automobiles, and other things that move. And sometimes it will tell you some interesting scientific tricks.

But among you, there are many children who not only do not feel interested in this subject, but even have a feeling of disgust. What is the reason for this? The reason is that they have taken the wrong path of research. They memorize unfamiliar terms and dull texts without thinking about them, memorize them rigidly, read them to death, making them dizzy and exhausting their brains, but in the end, they still don't understand the reasons for them. What's the use of this?

Little friends, the subject of nature requires a research mentality. There is no need to read it to death. As long as you observe frequently, every plant and tree in nature, even a piece of mud and a piece of stone, is a living textbook for studying nature. The key is to use your brain to think very carefully, and then use your own hands to do it. Think and do, do and think, then your interest will naturally increase, and the principles it talks about will naturally be understood. For this subject, we must not be impatient or hasty. We must observe and test patiently. If we don't understand, look again and look again. If we fail, don't be discouraged. Think again and try again. If we continue in this way, we will eventually understand it. Look at the inventors in the world, which one did not succeed after one or two times, or even tens, hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of times of testing?

In short, studying nature requires not being afraid of difficulties, not reading textbooks to death, but combining hands and brains, pursuing the truth from doing, and having the determination to try again and again. If you do this day after day, then the nature that you were initially unhappy to make friends with will unconsciously become a good friend of yours.

### Young Drummer

‚Äî Liyi

Napoleon, who dominated the world, fought against the famous Austrian general Melas when he attacked Austria. Unfortunately, he was defeated in the place of Malego! His famous general Desa led the defeated army and temporarily stationed in front of a hill. Napoleon stood on the hill and saw that his army was defeated beyond recognition, so he said to the young drummer beside him, "Beat the retreat drum!"

This young drummer had participated in many battles. He was so brave, although he was very young. When he heard this, he picked up the drumsticks and walked to Napoleon and said, "General, I don't know how to beat the retreat drum. I only know how to beat the charge drum. I beat the drum to make the soldiers rush forward one after another, bravely and fearlessly. I beat such drums next to the pyramids, on Mount Tabor, and under the Rodi Bridge. Should I beat such drums here again?"

Napoleon was very moved, so he said to Desa, "We have been defeated. What should we do?" Desa immediately replied, "What should we do? Let's defeat them! Drummer! Beat the charge drum!"

So the defeated army turned around and advanced. Desa unfortunately died in the first row of gunfire. Napoleon's army fought bravely and finally won the victory. This is the famous victory of Malego in history. When later generations talked about the battle of Malego, they praised Napoleon's martial prowess without end. Who knew that this was entirely due to the strength of the young drummer?

Little friends! What are your thoughts after reading the above?

### Third Brother's Repeating a Grade

‚Äî Xintian

A letter came from Sanbei School. In addition to a report card and a payment slip, there was also a small piece of paper. At that time, I thought it must be something like a tuition fee increase, but when I opened it, I was shocked. It said: "...The student of your house, √ó√ó, failed the exam this semester. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, he will continue to study in the original grade next semester. I hope you will observe..." Third brother was standing next to me, concentrating on the report card. Suddenly he noticed my surprised look and quickly shifted his gaze. I was afraid that he would be greatly stimulated if he saw it, so I folded it up casually; but unfortunately, the key point had already been known to him. Immediately, he reached out and took the paper and then wept.

The hearts of all children are very fragile. When they are so sad that they cannot restrain themselves, they can only use crying to vent. I knew that comfort was useless, so let him vent for a while. But when I turned my head and saw the shame on Third Brother's face, I couldn't help but think of how he usually studied. Indeed, Third Brother is the most fond of reading in the family. He usually doesn't play much. I remember a few days before the exam, he even stayed up all night reading. At that time, my father said that his grades must be better than ours. Who knew that after the results were announced, he would encounter such misfortune.

Because of this, I became suspicious about the matter of Third Brother repeating a grade. So I opened my mouth and asked him, "Third Brother, don't cry. I have something to tell you. Didn't you prepare very well for this exam beforehand? How could you fail?" Third Brother wiped away his tears and looked at me as if asking for help. "I am really too timid; on the day of the exam, I was very scared, and because I didn't sleep well, I was very dizzy. I didn't know how to answer the questions on the exam paper. It seemed like I had forgotten everything I had read at that time. I thought and thought, but I couldn't think of anything, and time was running out. In a hurry, I had to hand in the paper randomly. As a result..." As he said that, tears welled up again. Listening to his reasons, I knew the reason why he repeated a grade. So I advised him, "Third Brother, I understand. The fundamental reason for you repeating a grade is actually because you misunderstood the meaning of 'studying'. You thought that studying was nothing more than for the sake of exams, as long as you got a lot of marks. You got a upgrade and study will be achieved. In fact, it is not that simple at all. If you want points, just promote grade, and during the exam, there are many people who cheat a lot. So grades are by no means important things, and seeking knowledge is the most important job. When you go to school, just try to acquire practical knowledge, and don't worry about anything else. Exams are just a tool to measure how much knowledge you have. Can you connect these points to find the shortest route to catch a rabbit? Also, a diligent person will definitely be able to pass, so don't take exams too seriously and be afraid. If you relax a little, your courage will naturally increase; if you don't drive a car day and night, the dizziness and brain swelling will certainly not happen. This time of repeating a grade is the driving force for you to change. If you can resolve to change your attitude towards studying from now on, and do it according to what I said, then this time of repeating a grade is by no means a shameful thing for you." After speaking, I looked at him solemnly. In that short glance, I seemed to feel that I had gained valuable gains.

### Why is it Easy to Have a Headache in Crowded Places?

‚Äî Baili

Ming'er and his father went to the theater to watch a movie. After returning home, Ming'er just kept saying that he had a headache. His father said, "It must be watching the movie that made your head hurt."

"Can watching a movie also cause a headache?" Ming'er asked in surprise.

"Yes, because there are too many people in the movie theater, and the air doesn't circulate very well. It's easy to get a headache. If you are alone in a small room and don't let the air circulate, then you will soon get a headache. This is because there is dirty air in the room. In this crowded movie theater, the air is of course even dirtier," his father said, taking a sip of tea and continuing, "This dirty air is the useless and harmful waste that is excreted from our bodies. No matter how clean a person is, they will have this kind of excretion. But we also need to know what kind of excretion can make the air dirty. As a result, we know that it is the excretion from the skin, especially the excretion from unclean skin, which is more likely to make the air dirty. After we breathe in this dirty air, it can make the blood vessels in our brain circulate poorly, so we get a headache." After his father explained this, Ming'er understood.

### The Fan's Autobiography

‚Äî Zhang Xixian

I am a beautiful small fan. My master is still young, so I call him young master.

The young master treats me very well. He carefully puts me in a specially made box. Now the weather is very hot, the young master takes me out of the box, puts me next to him, and takes me to school. The young master praises my flexibility and beauty. The other children look at me and admire me, I am extremely happy. Now, let me describe my past history:

I was a fan in the window of a certain company for a long time. One day, a mother and son paid a high price to buy me. The staff in the company immediately handed me over to him. He loves me very much, so I have been living a happy life until now.

Questions After the Rain Lin Ren

The weather in summer really changes. When it is happy, it blows the dark clouds away and lets the hot sun shine on the ground. When it is unhappy, it summons wind and clouds and pours down heavy rain, but the rain will not last too long. In a while, it will be sunny again after the rain.

When it rained, it caused a lot of questions in Aliang's mind, turning around in his brain. One afternoon, when it was raining heavily, he asked his father, who was writing:

"Dad! Why does the rain fall in drops? Is there any rain that falls in pieces?"

His father smiled when he heard this question, wondering how he could come up with such a question, but he didn't feel disgusted. On the contrary, he felt that his son was willing to use his brain and could think of such a meaningful question. He was very happy in his heart. He thought for a while and said to him with a smile:

"Before answering your question, do you know how there is rain?"

"I know. Mr. Zhang, who teaches nature, told us: When the water in the river is heated by the sun, the water turns into water vapor and rises to the sky. But the higher the sky, the colder the temperature. When the water vapor hits the cold, it condenses and turns into raindrops and falls down. But he only talked about Daoli, but didn't tell us why the rain falls in drops?" Aliang answered like reciting a book.

"Have you ever thought about it? When water vapor hits the cold, how does it condense into raindrops? This is because there are countless dust particles in the sky, and raindrops are water vapor condensed on a particle of dust, so of course it becomes one drop after another. Even if the rain initially falls in chunks, the air has friction, and when the rain block falls, it must pass through the air and be subjected to the friction of the air, and it will still have to divide the rain block into one drop after another. Let me give you an example to make it clear: Doesn't the water sprayed out by the fountain go straight up in a straight line? But when the water is sprayed to a high place and falls down, the water will no longer form a straight line, but becomes one drop after another."

"Dad, where does so much rain that falls today flow to?" Aliang asked about something else.

"The rainwater that falls flows into the ditch, and the water in the ditches all over Shanghai follows the ditches to the ocean; some of it falls into the soil, and there are many roots of trees, flowers and plants in the soil. The roots have the ability to absorb water, and they absorb the water into the tree body and leaves, so that the tree will not die of drought: some of the water flows into the small river; and some of the water is immediately dried into water vapor by the sun when it falls on the ground. Therefore, only half of the total rainfall flows into the ocean."

"So is there a place in the world where it never rains?" Aliang asked another question.

"There is no place in the world where it doesn't rain. Even in the desert, which is considered the driest place, there are sometimes strong winds and heavy rains. Like the Sahara Desert in Africa, it doesn't not rain at all, but there are very few opportunities for rain, even only once every few years. People there value water as much as we value gold."

Aliang listened with great interest. When he finished speaking, he picked up the pen and wrote again, and he was embarrassed to interrupt his father's writing again.

The Arts

### Chaplin's Quirks

‚Äî Cheng Wei

Since ancient times, geniuses have invariably possessed eccentric personalities, and Charlie Chaplin is naturally no exception. Moreover, he is exceptionally quirky. Now, let me tell you all:

Fond of Sports ‚Äì A lover of solitude, he often goes for walks alone. When the mood strikes, he'll walk fifteen miles, then call his chauffeur to pick him up. Sometimes, on the way home, he would abandon the car and walk, letting the chauffeur drive back first. He considers golf a game for idiots because chasing after a ball after hitting it seems a bit ridiculous. At seventeen, as an amateur, he participated in the British 26-mile marathon and surprisingly came in second. He loves swimming and baseball, but dismisses football as one of the games for fools. He is very skilled at playing poker, but only plays for half an hour at most. He has never been fond of gambling, but he always speculates in the stock market with decisions of thousands of dollars or more.

Morbid Gluttony ‚Äì He is very casual about what he eats. Plain boiled beef tripe and mutton suit his palate best. He is obsessed with curry, the spicier the better. Sometimes he can go without eating for twenty-four hours, and the next day he will eat four or five meals in a row. He is most afraid of getting sick, but often, because the dishes suit his palate, he adds four or five servings in one go, resulting in another bout of illness. He never went to school, but he has a collection of three thousand books, which he consults and studies on his own. He enjoys reading the Bible the most, but he does not believe in any religion. He often suddenly thinks of going to church and runs to the church without a second thought, but which denomination does the church he enters and the service he attends belong to? After he finishes and follows people out, even he himself is baffled.

Indifferent to Wealth ‚Äì His left hand is more agile, but he can write with both hands. He doesn't write much. In the past ten years, he has written less than twelve handwritten letters. The sentences he writes are very short ‚Äì about five or six words. He has never received music education, but he is proficient in all kinds of instruments. When he plays the organ at home, it is always for three or four hours. When playing the violin, he holds the bow with his left hand and presses the strings with his right hand. The arrangement of the thick and thin strings is the opposite of the usual. He is very rich, so he is very indifferent to wealth. It is rare for him to be happy to work. People in the photography studio often "just eat and do nothing for several months, with Chaplin paying their full salaries." When he is inspired and thinks of filming, he suddenly appears in the photography studio, urging people to work like a madman, almost completing ten days of work in one day, making everyone sweat profusely, and exhausting himself!

Singing After Bathing ‚Äì His residence is very large, and only he and six male servants live inside. Women, except for his own relatives, rarely enter his home. He refuses to let others light the stove; he must do it himself. The fuel for the fireplace is large pieces of coal; firewood is not allowed. He must take four baths a day: once in the morning, once at noon, once before dinner, and once before going to bed. In the bathtub, he always raises his voice and sings, singing baritone, with tunes but no lyrics, singing everything from southern to northern tunes. In the evening, wearing a brightly colored bathrobe, he locks himself in the bedroom, locking every door himself, even the door connecting to the bathroom is firmly closed. As for the windows, they are kept open all night.

Carefully Reading Newspapers ‚Äì Every morning after waking up, his servant delivers breakfast and two newspapers to him before he gets up. He eats and reads the newspapers, reading everything on the paper in detail. If he feels that the editorial or news is poorly written, he will get angry and scold the reporters. He has more than two dozen sets of pajamas. When getting up, he always puts his feet on the right side of the bed, stepping on a fixed spot. If the servant inadvertently puts the mink blanket in the wrong place, he will feel very unhappy all day. In short, he is an outstanding freak, and his quirks are truly endless. Due to the small space, I can only briefly write down these few points.

### Random Notes After Playing the Qin (1)

‚Äî Hua Yu

I love to study the qin, but I lack teachers and friends. In my spare time, I often use books and records to explore. Over time, I have gradually gained some knowledge, so I write it down in a book. Now I record a few notes to enrich the art world and to discuss with fellow enthusiasts.

It is well known that the Jinghu (Beijing Opera fiddle) is divided into the Mei and Sun schools. The Sun school emphasizes strength, and its playing is heroic and unparalleled, full of courage. Therefore, its sound is clear as pearls strung together, and its momentum is lively. Wang Shaoqing inherited its skills. The Mei school's qin emphasizes softness, and its playing is characterized by steadiness and thickness, lingering and endless, with inexhaustible implications. Hu Tiefen inherited it. Beginners in qin should take the Mei school as their foundation, adopting its rules and regulations. After a little progress, they can emulate the Sun school to obtain its vigor and strength, which will be perfect!

The method of supporting the melody can be fully described with the four words "wrap, follow, cushion, supplement." Let me try to explain their meaning:

Wrap - To wrap a small number of notes with a large number of notes. For example, when the female role in Xipi opera sings the closing phrase, it is often "gong liu" (5 6 in numbered musical notation), and the Jinghu uses "gong wu liu" (5 56) to wrap it. Or if the phrase is "liu yi si" (6 7 4), then "liu si yi chi si" (6 4 7 1 4) is used to wrap it.

Brief News

This is indeed correct, and a correction is hereby made.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

‚Äî Gu Mingdao

Chapter 12: As Helpless as Ning Wu

The day before yesterday, I received another letter from you, scolding me for refusing to come out and kill the bandits. How sad I was in my heart, so I first sent the messenger back to report, and then, at night, I took my precious sword and dart bag, left without saying goodbye, and had to leave my aunt alone, and came to Ningwu Pass to help in the battle, to show my determination, hoping to make a small contribution. On the way to outside Daizhou City, I encountered a small team of bandits, killed several of them, and snatched a fine horse to rush here. It just so happened that I rescued Jing Ge here. Isn't this fate? But I don't know what the situation is like at Ningwu Pass? Can it still be defended?" Xu Jing said: "So you had this difficult situation, I wrongly blamed you." Then he told him about the urgent situation in the pass. After speaking for a long time, he felt even more tired and could not hold on. So, he first took off his armor and hung the Red Phoenix Precious Sword on the wall. Turning around, he saw a meditation bed on the east wall, walked over with staggering steps, and lay down. He sighed and said, "My arm hurts very much, and I am very tired. I am sleepy and just want to lie down." Liu Yining said, "Jing Ge, your injury is not light, rest for a while, that's good. There are no good medicines for wounds here, otherwise I would have applied them to you earlier. The bandit general is extremely hateful. I didn't kill him, which is too much of a bargain for him." Xu Jing said, "A tiger that has been hit by your dart will not be peaceful even if it goes back. Let him suffer some too. I only hope that General Zhou can hold on. After I rest for a while, I will go back and kill them with you to help General Zhou kill the bandits." Liu Yining said, "Very good, you close your eyes and sleep, I will protect you here. I don't think the roving bandits will kill up here." As he spoke, the old monk came with a wooden tray holding a bowl of porridge and a dish of salted vegetables, which he placed on the table, saying, "There are no tasty dishes in the temple, and there is nowhere to buy them here. Please, two generals, just eat some." Liu Yining said, "Thank you for your trouble." Then he scooped a bowl for Xu Jing and had Xu Jing sit on the couch to eat. He also scooped porridge for himself and ate. Xu Jing ate two bowls and felt full. He didn't want to eat any more. Liu Yining also ate two bowls and put them down, letting the old monk take them away. Liu Yining then told Xu Jing to sleep peacefully. Xu Jing was already tired, closed his eyes, and fell into a deep sleep. (114)
