### Japanese Troops Invade Northern Hunan, Repelled by Chinese Army; Japanese Troops Completely Cleared from Suburbs of Zhongmou; Guilin Observes Routes of Japanese Invasion of Southwest

Chongqing Military News On the eighth of this month,   Japanese troops stealthily crossed the Xinqiang River near Tuanzhanggangzui in northern Hunan and advanced towards China. They were repelled by the Chinese army, suffering heavy losses. On the fourteenth, over a thousand Japanese troops advanced towards Koukou (ten miles southwest of Sanshui County) and other places. They were met with resistance by the Chinese army. By the afternoon of the sixteenth, the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties and were forced to retreat towards Sanshui.

By the evening of the fifteenth, the Japanese troops in the suburbs had been completely cleared. The remaining Japanese, entrenched in a corner of the city, were resisting stubbornly, but the Chinese army inflicted heavy casualties. The remaining Japanese were still under heavy attack by Chinese forces. (17th Dispatch)

### Overseas Chinese Actively Assist the Motherland

Hong Kong Chicago Chinese leader   Tan, attended a banquet held by Chen Ce and Chen Qingyun tonight. Sun Ke, Vice President Xu, Chong Jiu, Fang Zhenwu, Li Xing   , and over fifty representatives from the press were present. Tan gave a speech, stating that "Although the 3,000 Chinese in Chicago have donated US$1.4 million since the war began, we deeply understand that this is a responsibility that Chinese citizens should bear. We dare not be complacent, because compared to the sacrifices and lives of our compatriots in China, this small donation is insignificant. Even if Japan wins, we overseas Chinese will have no way to contribute, so money is worthless. The oppression of Jewish people around the world serves as a clear example. The sole purpose of money is to assist the motherland and defeat the invaders." He also stated that when the Sino-Japanese War first began, foreigners believed that China could not resist for more than six months. But four years later, China is getting stronger and stronger. This is due to the spirit of unity and cooperation between the soldiers at the front and the people at the rear, as well as their heroic sacrifices. All of these things have greatly inspired overseas Chinese. (15th Dispatch)

### Foreign Minister Guo Reports on Diplomacy at National Political Council Meeting; Japan Has Not Changed Its Current Policy; No Possibility of Compromise Between the United States and Japan

Chongqing Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi reported on diplomatic affairs at the National Political Council meeting this afternoon. According to what he told reporters this afternoon, the United Kingdom and the United States are as concerned about maintaining the opening of the Burma Road in the event of a Japanese attack as they are about maintaining the smooth flow of the Pacific route. At the same time, the Chinese authorities are taking all necessary precautions to cope with any eventuality. The speeches given by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Togo in the Diet today did not indicate any desire on the part of Japan to change its current policy. He saw no possibility of any compromise between the United States and Japan. Guo also spoke of the People's Political Council, saying that the democratic rights of other countries are often suppressed in wartime, while China is using this war to implement new democratic organizations such as the Political Council, which serve as a mechanism for the exchange of views between the government and the people's representatives. Moreover, because the Political Council includes representatives from various political parties, it is a sign of internal unity. Although China's democracy is not yet comparable to that of the United Kingdom and the United States, we are not satisfied with the status quo. China is moving forward on the path of modern democracy and adapting China's ancient traditions to the circumstances of this era. The mild tone of Prime Minister Tojo's speech has increased the belief here that Japan will try to avoid war with the United States. Some had believed that Tojo might adopt a threatening posture in order to strengthen Kurusu's position in Washington, but Tojo apparently did not do so. (17th Reuters Dispatch)

Reuters Dispatch, Hong Kong, 17th An editorial in the "Hong Kong Telegraph" today said that the most reassuring aspect of Hong Kong's welcoming of Canadian troops with a sense of gratitude is that well-trained and well-equipped troops have been transferred to Hong Kong.

Hong Kong does not want to fight, but it does not want to make a dishonorable retreat. The Far Eastern outpost of the British Empire will not retreat.

### Key to War or Peace in the Pacific; US-Japan Talks Begin; Nomura and Kurusu Visit Secretary of State Hull; Unlikely to Achieve Anything Given Unchanged Basic Policies

United Press, Washington, 17th Talks that well-informed sources say will determine the tense issue of war or peace in the Pacific began today between Secretary of State Hull and Japanese special envoy Kurusu. Kurusu may meet with President Roosevelt today, but the main part of the talks will be conducted by Hull. Japanese Ambassador to the United States Admiral Nomura will also participate in this State Department negotiation. The talks will begin at 10:30 AM today (11:30 PM Shanghai time). Ambassador Nomura and Kurusu discussed various preliminary details at the Japanese embassy yesterday. Reliable sources say that Ambassador Nomura will continue to be the main spokesman for the Japanese side, while Kurusu will be a "negotiator for extraordinary times." Japanese sources say that they believe there is hope of reaching an understanding. Experts on foreign policy in Congress also reflect the same view. However, diplomats from various countries almost unanimously say that Kurusu has little chance of success. Diplomats believe that the United States has the cooperation of China, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Dutch East Indies, and the Soviet Union, and its diplomatic position is very strong. Therefore, the United States is unlikely to make concessions. On the other hand, the Japanese government has adopted a tough, aggressive stance in the past three years, so it is difficult for the country to change its policies without causing serious domestic reactions. The problem between the United States and Japan is whether the United States can allow Japan to continue its policy of expansion and promote its "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." This "Co-Prosperity Sphere" would include economic or political enslavement of China. The United States has already begun to assist China, the United Kingdom, the Dutch East Indies, and other countries that are about to be defeated by Japan. The United States believes that it is about to become a very great defeated country, because the interests of the United States in areas entered by the Japanese army, such as Manchuria, China, and French Indochina, have already been destroyed. The United States accuses Japan of being an aggressor, so it opposes Japan's program, especially now wishes to contain Japan, because Japan is allied with the Axis. The Japanese recognize that the situation is very serious, on the one hand because they cannot withstand economic sanctions, and on the other hand because Japanese newspapers are singing tunes urging the government to "break through the encirclement of democratic countries." Observers doubt whether Japan, regardless of the fact that the four-year-old, fruitless war of aggression against China is still ongoing, will risk fighting another country in the Pacific. However, many believe that the Japanese have a "suicide disease," so they may not hesitate to make a desperate gamble.

Close Military Cooperation Between Australia and New Zealand; Preparing to Resist Any Aggression

Reuters Dispatch, Washington, 17th New Zealand Prime Minister Nash broadcast Australia and New Zealand's common defense policy and his feelings after his recent trip to Australia, saying that a major conflict could occur in the Pacific at any time. He is confident that Australia's military preparations will be a powerful and decisive element in resisting any challenge to freedom and democracy in the Pacific. Japan has joined the Axis and seems determined to pursue a policy of aggression. This is something that Australia and New Zealand must pay very serious attention to.

Reuters Dispatch, Canberra, 17th Australian Prime Minister Curtin announced today that the danger to Australia in the Pacific is extremely great. No one in Australia knows when they will have to rise up in self-defense. Australia does not want to fight in the Pacific, but this decision is not in our hands. Australia has not taken any offensive action in the Pacific, but it is prepared to resist attackers with all its strength.

Reuters Dispatch, Melbourne, 17th Mr. Duff Cooper, the British War Cabinet's representative in the Far East, spoke to the public here yesterday, saying that we will not cease fighting until Hitler and his ideology and supporters are completely destroyed. The highest principle of the Nazi Party is that Germans are masters and others are their slaves. Hitler knows nothing of what is called kindness, humanity, gentleness, or generosity. His concentration camps and the treatment he inflicts on the Polish people will make the name of Nazism stink for ten thousand years. We are responsible for resisting this devil.

### Thailand Takes Precautions by Conscripting Volunteers; Thai Government Regains Command; Japanese Feel Uneasy About It

United Press, Bangkok, 17th A Bangkok radio station said last night that the Prime Minister threatened to resign because the press, radio stations, and the people could not agree, so the radio stations stopped broadcasting criticisms and issued warnings to the people, saying that they must be prepared to deal with possible disputes. Moments later, the government ordered the governors of each province to recruit volunteers aged 18 to 45 and 46 and over. Senior Thai government officials said that they did not expect Thailand to be drawn into the war, but also said that the future cannot be predicted. Japanese sources here said that the Japanese ambassador in Bangkok was "panic-stricken" about the government's re-establishment of supreme command.

### Speeches by Tojo and Togo Clarifying Three Points of Japanese National Policy: Indicating That the US Should Not Obstruct Japan's Establishment of a New Order in East Asia, the Tone is Still Moderate, but Implies Despair and Pessimism

Reuters, Tokyo, 17th - The speeches delivered by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in the Diet this morning, while lacking any sensational remarks, have at least corroborated the concepts regarding Japan's position held by well-informed circles in Tokyo in recent months. Both speeches were unusually moderate in tone, but implied an atmosphere of despair and pessimism. Foreign Minister Togo, while not explicitly stating this point, emphasized the peace of the Pacific Ocean, now pinned on Kurusu's mission to Washington. Prime Minister Tojo also explicitly stated that Japan requires Britain and the United States, along with their allies, to reverse their current policies towards Japan. However, the outcome remains uncertain.

Prime Minister's Speech

Reuters, Tokyo, 17th - Prime Minister Tojo delivered a 25-minute speech in the House of Peers this morning, stating that based on past experiences, it is difficult to predict the outcome of the Japan-US negotiations. Therefore, the government is determined to adopt all necessary plans to realize Japan's firm policies. Japan is continuing diplomatic negotiations with the US government, genuinely attempting to eliminate the interference of third countries in the China Incident, end hostile actions such as the economic blockade imposed on Japan by foreign countries, restore normal international economic relations, and strive to prevent the European war from spreading to the Far East. If these three objectives are achieved through diplomatic efforts, not only will Japan be pleased, but it will also create peace in East Asia and the world. However, based on past experiences, the outcome of the negotiations remains uncertain. The government, foreseeing the obstacles in its path, is determined to spare no effort in safeguarding the survival of the Japanese Empire through various preparations, in order to actively implement its established national policies. Continuing his review of the

Northern Situation, he stated that since the start of the German-Soviet war in June, the possibility of its future changes is a cause for concern. Japan cannot remain indifferent to this development. In view of this, the government is now taking all necessary plans to ensure peace in the north. Regarding the situation in the south, the Prime Minister mentioned the peaceful entry of Japanese troops into northern Vietnam. Japan and Vietnam have concluded an economic agreement, Thailand and Vietnam have mediated border disputes, and Japan and Vietnam have established close and harmonious relations. Japan has begun peaceful advances in the south, but the military and economic cooperation between Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and India has been enhanced. Japan's economic negotiations with the Netherlands East Indies have failed. The overall situation contains a serious threat to Japan's position in the South Pacific. Therefore, Japan has concluded a joint defense

Agreement with the Vichy Government. According to the agreement, Japan was able to send reinforcements to southern Vietnam in late July. However, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and India deeply distrusted this legitimate self-defense plan, and froze the assets of Japanese people in their respective countries, ultimately implementing an economic blockade through a complete embargo. At the same time, they rapidly expanded their anti-Japanese military plans. It is difficult to understand how an economic blockade can be implemented between non-belligerent countries, and its hostile nature is no less than an armed operation plan. This kind of action not only hinders the resolution of the China Incident that Japan desires to achieve, but also greatly affects the survival of the Japanese Empire. Therefore, Japan cannot tolerate it. Although Japan has always earnestly desired the preservation of peace, it has spared no effort in using diplomatic negotiations to eliminate this crisis, so that the overall situation can be resolved peacefully. However, Japan's expectations have not been realized. The Empire has had to deal with a serious situation and must decide on the course to be taken for generations to come. Tojo then discussed the

War in China, stating that the work of resolving the war has entered its final stage, but the economic and military activities of the countries assisting General Chiang Kai-shek have become increasingly active. This is the last remaining pillar of Chongqing's ability to resist, and it is greatly hindering the successful conclusion of the China Incident. Tojo finally expressed his deep gratitude to Manchukuo and the Nanjing government for their continued cooperation with Japan, and congratulated the achievements of the allied nations, especially Germany and Italy, stating that Japan hopes that these countries will achieve victory and lay the foundation for a new world order based on justice with the Japanese Empire.

Foreign Minister's Speech

He stated that although Japan is striving towards reconciliation and completing Japan-US negotiations, our moderate attitude naturally has a limit. If a situation arises that threatens the survival of the Empire or harms Japan's prestige as a major power, Japan must deal with it with a firm attitude. This is beyond doubt. Japan-US negotiations have lasted for six months, so there is no need to waste more time in the future. If the US government sincerely wants to preserve world peace, like Japan, understands Japan's natural needs and its position in East Asia, and considers the current situation in which Japan finds itself based on reality, then a friendly outcome is not impossible. Talks are still in progress, but he cannot disclose the details of the talks. In addition to seeking a successful conclusion to the war in China, Japan is also concerned about the situation in the north and the south seas. The Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact was concluded for this reason, in order to ensure peace in the north. Although war has broken out between Germany and the Soviet Union, Japan is still striving to maintain its policy of preserving peace in the north. Japan is determined to use various methods to prevent the occurrence of factors that may disturb peace in the north, and not only that, but also to prevent the development of situations that may threaten Japan's interests. The Foreign Minister then spoke of Japan's friendly relations with Vietnam and Thailand, stating that the malicious propaganda of third countries, saying that Japan is plotting aggressive attempts in that area, is truly regrettable. When Japanese troops entered southern Vietnam in accordance with the joint defense agreement, Britain and the United States viewed this as a threat to their territories, and froze the assets of Japanese people in their countries. This act is equivalent to a plan to sever economic relations. Britain and the United States also induced Australia, the Netherlands East Indies to join the encirclement of Japan, so the current situation facing Japan is becoming increasingly tense. Anti-Japanese pressure has become a real and serious problem. Japan is now facing an unprecedented difficult situation, so the entire nation must unite and join the military to cope with the most critical era in Japanese history.

### Finance Minister Kaya Reports: Financial Situation; Four Years of War Expenditure in China Reaches 4.8 Billion Yuan

United Press, Tokyo, 17th - Finance Minister Kaya reported to the Diet today that although the Sino-Japanese War has continued for four and a half years, Japan's finances are still very sound. Japan still has a large amount of financial resources to cope with national expenditures. He said that the nation's economic power has also been greatly enhanced in all aspects. Kaya also said that the freezing restrictions by Britain and the United States have seriously affected Japan's economy, so it is necessary to quickly establish the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and expand national defense institutions to resist any unreasonable forces that disrupt the order in East Asia. The Finance Minister requested 3,800,000,000 yen for special military expenses to cope with the increased emergency expenses of the army and navy, so as to end the China Incident and adapt to the current tense situation. The Finance Minister also stated that taxes have been expanded to meet the government's huge expenditures. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, government expenditures have reached 4,800,000,000 yuan, approximately equivalent to the total expenditure of Japan in the seventy years before 1936. Kaya also said that economic cooperation between Japan, Manchuria, and China has made significant progress, and trade with East Asian countries other than China and Manchuria has also greatly increased. Japan's new capital and savings have also increased, sufficient to absorb 20,000,000,000 yen of bonds and invest 23,000,000,000 yen in production and expansion.

### Japan's Collapsing Ambitions: Ambitiously Plans to Dig a Canal in the Kra Isthmus; If This Happens, the Strategic Situation Will Be Completely Changed

Havas, Tokyo, 17th - The English-language "Japan Chronicle" of Kobe published today that Japan has long had the intention of digging a canal in the Kra Isthmus of the Malay Peninsula.

If it can be realized, the military situation in the North Pacific waterway will be completely changed. Japanese ships can sail to the Indian Ocean more safely," it said.

### US Navy Department Announces: Intercepted Axis Ship; Attempted to Sink Itself While Carrying Supplies Under the American Flag, But Failed

United Press, Washington, 17th - The Navy Department announced yesterday that an Axis merchant ship flying the American flag was captured by a US cruiser west of the equatorial zone in the Atlantic. This is the first ship captured since the US fleet began patrolling the Atlantic at the start of the European war. Although this simple announcement did not elaborate on the matter, observers here believe that the captured ship was carrying supplies obtained from South America. The Navy Department did not state the nationality of the merchant ship, only that it belonged to the Axis powers.

Reuters, Washington, 17th - On November 6, a US cruiser captured an Axis ship flying the American flag. The disposal of the crew has not yet been disclosed, but it is likely that they have all been taken to port. It is generally believed that once the ship is under US jurisdiction, it will be confiscated, just like some other Axis ships in US ports earlier this year. According to a statement issued by the Navy, a US cruiser saw a merchant ship flying the American flag at dawn on November 6, and the American flag was painted on both sides of the hull and on the deck. Upon approaching, the name of a certain US ship was seen on both sides of the bridge and on both sides of the ship. However, due to its suspicious behavior, the cruiser immediately sent a "stop" signal and lowered a small boat to send an officer to investigate. But before the boat reached the ship, the crew began to abandon ship and flee, while hoisting a signal saying, "This ship is sinking, please send a boat to transport passengers." Immediately afterward, two explosions were heard inside the ship. The US cruiser immediately sent a rescue team to board the ship. After several hours of work, they managed to repair the leaks caused by the explosions and restarted its engine. According to the US cruiser's report, judging from the ship's documents, it is known that it is owned by people from a certain Axis country. The hull has been deliberately damaged by its crew and is severely damaged and cannot navigate. The US cruiser's crew is now trying to sail the ship to a seaport under the jurisdiction of the US court for repairs.

### General Weygand Returns Home for Duty; No Replacement Yet for the Army Minister, Darlan Temporarily Assumes Ministerial Duties

Havas, Vichy, 17th - French Commissioner for Africa General Weygand, after meeting with Marshal Pétain yesterday, met with Cabinet Secretary Darlan again today. It is said that Weygand's mission is to discuss economic issues in North Africa, and he will soon return to Algiers.

Reuters, French Border, 17th - Weygand's arrival in Vichy is to report to Pétain on the recent discussions with the late Huntziger and to consider Huntziger's replacement. According to people close to Vichy, Germany favors Weygand as Army Minister and Dentz as Governor-General of North Africa to succeed Dentz. However, it is generally believed that Weygand may not be willing to give up his position in North Africa.

Havas, Vichy, 17th - After the death of Army Minister General Huntziger, his ministerial duties will be temporarily assumed by Cabinet Secretary Darlan, and military affairs will be presided over by Chief of Staff General Picquendar. As for the choice of a new Army Minister, it is difficult to decide for the time being.

Reuters, Vichy, 17th - "Paris Soir" French reporter Bido said that Britain has five main routes that can be used to transport supplies directly from Iraq or India to the Transcaucasus and the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. The first route is located in the far west, starting from Qurna in Iraq, passing through Kermanshah and reaching the Soviet Caucasus border of Dzhulfa, where there is a railway connecting to Tbilisi. The second route is a road from Khanaqin in Iraq, passing through Qomash and Amol and reaching the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. The third route is the Syrian railway. The fourth route is the ancient post road, starting from Bushehr on the Persian Gulf and ending in Tehran. This road is now suitable for cars. The fifth route is considered important, starting from Karachi in India, passing through Balochistan and reaching Duzdab in Iran, then running along the Afghan border, stopping north of Mashhad, and one stop further is the railway connecting to the Transcaucasus and the Caspian Sea, he said.

### The Campaign to Eradicate Tuberculosis

In the interest of the city's health and happiness, the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association is advocating the eradication of tuberculosis. Within this week, it will hold an expanded publicity and fundraising campaign, planning to raise one million yuan to build a large-scale tuberculosis hospital. This measure is of great importance to the welfare of the entire society and the health of mankind. We earnestly hope that it will be successful as soon as possible, and at the same time, we appeal to all sectors to provide widespread sympathy and assistance.

According to statistics from the health authorities of the two concessions, in 1940 alone, more than 3,700 people died of tuberculosis. It is estimated that the number of deaths this year will exceed 6,000. As for those who have not been treated or reported, and those who suffer from the same disease and death in Chinese areas outside the concessions, they are even more countless. According to Dr. Henry Lester's rough estimate, at least 54,000 Shanghai citizens currently suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis should be hospitalized, and at least 8% have tuberculosis without realizing it—in other words, 320,000 people out of Shanghai's population of four million are being attacked by tuberculosis every day.

Such an alarming number does not allow us to hesitate any longer, we must exert all our intelligence to quickly eradicate this invisible enemy. People often have the bad habit of hiding their illnesses and avoiding doctors. They do not pay attention to their personal health, and even consider treating diseases to be unpleasant. As for undergoing physical examinations every year to prevent the invasion of diseases, that is even rarer. Once the disease has entangled them, they panic and seek medical attention. The delay in time affects the physiological changes, and often small illnesses become big illnesses, and big illnesses are misdiagnosed. As a result, precious lives are easily lost. This is extremely common and extremely tragic. In addition to those who hide their illnesses and avoid doctors, there are also many poor people who, because they cannot afford medical treatment, do not know what disease they are suffering from. The so-called charitable hospitals that provide free medical care often use the superficial symptoms presented by patients as the basis for diagnosis, treating them lightly and giving them the wrong medicine. In fact, the seriousness of the patient's condition may not be completely clear to the examiner. As a result, they are delayed and cannot be cured. Every year, countless millions of people lose their lives in this way. Therefore, while we vigorously support the eradication of tuberculosis, we also suggest that we use twelve points of strength to engage in tuberculosis prevention, such as the implementation of early examinations and the equipment for isolation and recuperation, all of which should be carried out as soon as possible, so that we can prevent problems before they occur and eliminate them invisibly. The most urgent work is to carry out widespread publicity, so that the dangerous impression of tuberculosis enters the hearts of everyone.

As for the significance of the campaign to eradicate tuberculosis, it is profound and significant to the country and society. From a passive perspective, this measure is to restore individual health, and from an active perspective, it is to strengthen national power. People suffering from lung disease extend their lives through appropriate treatment. They will certainly be able to accomplish more in their careers and make more contributions to the country. Assuming that one person can gain an extra year of work, then 10,000 people can have 10,000 years of achievement. What is its impact on national power? Therefore, the campaign to eradicate and prevent tuberculosis can certainly be called a campaign to strengthen national power!

We should also deeply recognize that anything involving the social public must have a close relationship with anyone's interests. The tuberculosis prevention campaign is one such example. Eradicating the great enemy of society is to protect one's own family. We must give it our full support. The gentlemen of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association have shouldered the great and righteous cause of benefiting the masses. Their organization is very sound and open. In order to ensure that all donations can be used for public purposes, all publicity and necessary expenses for fundraising are undertaken by the staff themselves. Such pure good intentions will surely arouse the infinite sympathy of the latent society and establish a good model for running charitable undertakings. We look forward to the near future when the great tuberculosis hospital will meet the society with brand-new scientific equipment; and the eradication of tuberculosis throughout Shanghai has been planted here with its foundation.

### Agricultural Production and National Economy

The world often believes that the foundation of the national economy is based on industry. Therefore, whether economic problems can be properly resolved depends on the progress of industrial development. According to this logic, if industry can achieve rational development, then the establishment of the foundation of the national economy can be solved easily. The importance of this industry is undeniable. However, without the nourishment of agriculture and the life-sustaining elements that can fill the stomach and maintain vitality, even the national defense industry of airplanes and cannons and the novel products that satisfy the material enjoyment of life will be useless. Therefore, the importance of agriculture is no less than that of industry.

Although countries with developed national defense industries and manufacturing industries can exchange their inherent products for agricultural products from other countries, from the perspective of national and ethnic standpoints, all countries are actively seeking to complete their entire economic mechanism and seek independent survival. There are many examples of great powers supporting agricultural production as an economic foundation. The United States is the world's largest industrial country, but its economic foundation is still built on agricultural production, so the rise and fall of its social economy depends entirely on the prosperity and decline of agriculture. The United Kingdom has always been the leader in the world's industry, but it still relies on the supplement of agriculture. Therefore, it has expanded its territory, with agriculture as the center to support and complete its economic supply network. In recent years, the rapid progress of industry in Soviet Russia has been watched by the world, and its progress in agricultural production has also repeatedly set world records, and it has been established as the foundation of the Soviet Russian economy. Germany has a small area and focuses on industry, but the lack of agricultural production constitutes a serious gap in the German economy. Therefore, it uses various methods in peacetime to obtain assistance from the agricultural products of various countries, and this time, it is willing to be the first to start the Second World War, also because it urgently needs to seek a way out for the livelihood of its people.

Since the importance of agricultural production is as mentioned above, it is not difficult for us to imagine how governments of various countries attach importance to the distribution and consumption of agricultural production. The selling price of agricultural products in peacetime does not fluctuate wildly, and the right of equal enjoyment by the people is guaranteed. In wartime, the government imposes strict control. The government distributes personal or family consumption according to the specified price, so there is absolutely no malady of favoritism. But these are all minimum facilities. Countries such as Soviet Russia and Germany regard agricultural products as a second life, and compare them to airplanes and cannons. Now, let us briefly list two of Germany's agricultural policies to clarify the truth.

Since the Nazis took power, Germany's food policy has imitated the Soviet Union's use as a political weapon. All those who want to awaken national unity, urge farmers to cooperate, supervise the rational construction of manufacturing, change the habits of people who are addicted to luxurious living, and promote general internal affairs problems, all use the supply or non-supply of this food weapon as a guide. Those who commit crimes and repeatedly fail to repent will be punished by stopping the supply of food, and those who have achievements or merits will increase their food supply as a reward.

From an economic point of view, the Nazi food policy revolution fully demonstrates its understanding of the importance of agricultural production. Since 1934, the Nazis have imitated Mussolini's policy and started their production war, first reducing imports, then increasing food prices, and reducing the profits of distributors. Therefore, the burden of consumers has slightly increased, and the profits of businessmen have greatly decreased. Therefore, the profits of domestic agricultural development belong to the government. All agriculture and agriculture-related manufacturing industries have been carefully studied and thoroughly transformed; whether farmers, laborers, food distributors, or milk retailers, they are all compiled as Nazi food soldiers and promote this new food policy for the government. After the completion of this food policy revolution, the experiment of reforming eating habits and cooking methods was promoted. After the joint research of first-class economists, food nutritionists, and psychologists, the amount of food consumption for each person was formulated, and this formulated food unit was handed over to the people for testing. Since the Nazis declared war on Poland on September 1, 1939, the German people have uniformly implemented this food unit consumption, and have never slackened until now. This is the Nazi's method of solving food shortages, and their intentions are also very good.

Our country claims to be founded on agriculture, but it is a great regret that the people's food cannot be self-sufficient. In order to punish the past and be wary of the future and to consider the general trend of the world, our country is most suitable for running agriculture, because agriculture is easier to succeed; industry can be carried out in parallel, but we should not hold excessive hope, because from the standpoint of the national economy, we should urgently revitalize agriculture to consolidate the foundation and then make other plans.

Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Farmers Bank will buy the land of large landlords and sublet it to tenant farmers for cultivation. This is the prelude to the implementation of President Sun Yat-sen's legacy of equal land rights. All nationals support it. But what we dare to say at this time is that after the land is subleased to tenant farmers for cultivation, the government must still bear the responsibility of guidance and support, and must perform the result of the highest efficiency production and consolidate the foundation of the national economy. In other words, if the government implements this new land rights policy, then the government should take responsibility and complete its mission.

European War Review

### The Female Calamity of the French Political World

What Hélène most desired was to intertwine her destiny with that of her lover. At this time, Reynaud and his wife, Hélène and Count de Portes, were already separated. Reynaud’s wife had volunteered as a paratrooper nurse, and Count de Portes had been called up for military service.

Reynaud and Hélène lived together at the Palais Bourbon, directly opposite the National Assembly. However, Reynaud's wife was unwilling to divorce, and according to French law, under such circumstances, remarriage was not permitted unless it could be proven that the couple had been separated for more than three years. Hélène wanted to amend this law, but unfortunately, the only person with the power to change the law was the Minister of Justice, who at that time was Reynaud himself. He could not automatically amend it without disregarding his integrity.

Hélène did not hesitate at all and immediately went to see her formidable rival, the Marchioness de Crussol, and said to her: "If you want Reynaud to give up his ambition to become Prime Minister, if you want Daladier to give him a position so that he can better serve France, then we should let him be Minister of Finance. The current Minister of Finance, Marchandeau, is mediocre and incompetent, and also a supporter of the Munich policy. Bonnet is no longer Minister of Foreign Affairs, Daladier can take over the responsibility, and let Bonnet be Minister of Justice. Such a cabinet will certainly last longer."

The Marchioness de Crussol took Hélène to see Daladier, and this new arrangement was understood and established.

After Bonnet was appointed Minister of Justice, Hélène immediately went to see her friend Madame Bonnet and said: "Reynaud and your husband should reconcile. Tomorrow Reynaud will be Prime Minister, and he will recall Bonnet to take charge of the judicial office. But now I want Bonnet to do something for me, he should amend the divorce law."

After Bonnet took office as Minister of Justice, his first new initiative was to reduce the waiting period for remarriage after divorce from three years to one year.

Daladier was having a headache. Paul Reynaud's every move seemed as if he was about to become Prime Minister. He saw many political enemies targeting the current cabinet. Those who cooperated with him criticized the government leader's improper measures. Reynaud, through Hélène's house, entertained important military figures. Even General Têtu, the Secretary-General of Daladier's military advisory council, and General Giraud, to whom the advocates of offensive strategy pinned their hopes, were among those invited.

The Marchioness called the Countess, asking her to explain the truth. Hélène immediately went to see Daladier. Her excuse was very unique. She said: "If Paul's actions are indeed in breach of the agreement, it is only because his circumstances are so bad that he has no choice. You should force him to remove his Secretary-General, Palewski."

Thus, Hélène seized the opportunity to remove the thorn in her side. He was her most formidable enemy, and had been cooperating with Reynaud for ten years. He had always opposed that beautiful Countess.

Hélène immediately gave this position to her two confidants—Léguère and Trefeu.

Hélène had arranged everything. Reynaud must become Prime Minister. After the Finnish war, he indeed got his wish. The post of Minister of War was still held by Daladier concurrently.

Hélène no longer hid behind the scenes. Now she freely received guests at the Palais Bourbon and the Prime Minister's residence. She was now acting on her own.

At one cabinet meeting, Daladier passively resisted Reynaud's political views. He and Gamelin expressed their agreement and refused to send troops to Norway. He had had a broken foot for a long time, and he used this as an excuse not to go to London to sign the treaty that Britain and France should not make peace separately, which was signed on April 4th.

By May 10th, the German army suddenly advanced and broke through the defense line, causing great panic among the French General Staff and the government authorities. We should forgive Hélène and admit that she did not take time off to enjoy herself. She got up for twenty hours every day, running around, taking care of Reynaud's health, opposing the ministers leaving Paris, and advocating replacing Gamelin and Daladier with Weygand.

Reynaud himself quite hoped that his old friend General de Gaulle would be appointed Chairman of the Military Committee. Since 1936, de Gaulle had from time to time provided Reynaud with military documents, and later they all came true one by one. But Hélène insisted that he would be more beneficial to the country on the front lines. He had commanded the French tank corps and had long been well-known.

Instead, Hélène gave this position to Colonel Villelume, a famous officer in her reception room and a famous figure of defeatism.

The German army continued to advance. The Prime Minister's entire time was spent in Hélène's conspiracy. Her ingenious plans became more and more bizarre. She replaced the hardline Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Léger, and appointed her best friend, Baudouin, who was known for his Anglophobia, as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Secondly, she had her children escorted to the United States by a nanny.

At this time, the German army was advancing rapidly on all fronts, and the French army collapsed at the sight of them. The government evacuated Tours. Hélène and the Prime Minister were inseparable. Anyone who wanted to see him had to see her first.

The tragic end arrived. Those who favored an armistice and those who advocated continuing the war engaged in a fierce debate.

Reynaud firmly advocated continuing the war.

The German army was getting closer and closer. Tours had been bombed, and the government had to move to Bordeaux. Hélène abandoned all flattery and malice. She did not dress up and often wore a blue-purple dress, running around. She urged Reynaud to give way to Pétain and Baudouin.

She allowed Reynaud to have a seat as Ambassador to the United States. His name had been submitted to Washington. At ten o'clock in the evening on July 16th, Reynaud finally agreed. Originally, Hélène said to him: "Once we get to New York, we can get married."

Her great adventure did not succeed, but she did not give up everything.

On July 22nd, the day the armistice agreement was established, Léguère and Trefeu were suddenly arrested in Spain. They were Reynaud's comrades and Hélène's good friends. She had encouraged Baudouin to send one as a financial counselor to the United States and the other as the director of the French Purchasing Commission in New York to preside over liquidation matters.

Léguère and Trefeu were on a diplomatic mission, but the Spanish guards pretended not to know and searched their luggage as usual. As a result, in addition to important diplomatic documents, they also found jewelry, bonds, and gold worth two million francs. The French consul in San Sebastian immediately received the following notice: According to Léguère and Trefeu's explanation, this is the private property of the Countess de Portes, and as for the two million francs in gold, it is the government's secret fund, prepared for official expenses in the United States.

The gold was transported back to France by sea by the French ambassador in Madrid. The diplomatic documents were returned two weeks later.

Reynaud's appointment had been accepted by the White House, but it was immediately cancelled.

At that time, Reynaud and Hélène were on their way to southern France. On the way, they received the news of Léguère and Trefeu's arrest. (The two were later allowed to go to Portugal and then to Britain)

On June 27th, after Reynaud visited his daughter in Saint-Maxime, he and Hélène met in a restaurant. They both felt depressed. Hélène drove the car herself. An hour later, the car crashed into a telephone pole. When she was discovered, Hélène was dead, and Reynaud was also seriously injured.

Was this an accidental accident, an assassination, or a deliberate suicide? We will probably never know.

That woman, known as the "National Mother of the Ruined Country" in France, ended her life's adventure in this way.

As for the other heroines, they also temporarily disappeared. We only know that Bredin is still loyal to Mandel and lives in Riom, and goes to the prison to visit the former minister whenever she has the opportunity. There she can also meet Gamelin.

As for the Marchioness de Crussol, she never visited Daladier once. Reynaud, with his head bandaged, was confined alone in an ancient castle, immersed in memories of passionate love and the scars of failure every day.

### Snowstorm on the Moscow Front, Soviet Counterattacks Continue to Win, More Than Twenty Villages Recovered in the Central Route, German Troops Unable to Endure the Severe Cold and Feel Great Pain

Reuters, Moscow, 17th - Moscow Radio this morning reported that the German advance on the front lines in that area was being blocked everywhere. The Soviet army is now engaged in counterattacks. The German offensive towards Kalinin has been curbed. Two German infantry regiments, assisted by ninety tanks, had occupied three strongholds in the Volokolamsk area, but two of them were recaptured by the Soviet army that night. In the Maloyaroslavets area, the Soviet artillery severely damaged the German army.

Associated Press, London, 17th - According to Moscow Radio yesterday, the Soviet army, in a blizzard, launched an attack from Moscow as the starting point, recovering twenty villages. In one area, they drove the German army back several kilometers. It was also said that the Soviet army had broken through the German army for the first time since the beginning of winter. Nazi tanks were frozen and unable to use their skills. It was also said that the severe Soviet winter had brought the eastern war to a standstill. Even in the Crimean region, it was reported that it had snowed. On the Kalinin and Tula front lines, the Soviet army claimed to be in a proactive position. The radio said that the German troops were still wearing summer uniforms, so they all wished "to die rather than endure this pain, and some were said to have almost starved to death." The Soviet army admitted that the situation in Kerch and Sevastopol was critical.

Reuters, London, 17th - Reuters military commentator said that the twenty-second week of the Eastern Front war ended yesterday. Apart from the small victories in various places, there were no major developments on the long front line. The German side claimed to have occupied part of the Sevastopol defense line firmly held by the Soviet army, and captured more than a hundred strong strongholds near Tikhvin, southeast of Leningrad. However, more important than this is that the German side initially admitted that the Soviet army in the Moscow area was counterattacking with the assistance of artillery and tanks. The German communique had previously boasted that the Soviet army had been annihilated, and that the German army had been unable to take advantage of the victory to attack Moscow directly only because of the bad weather and muddy roads. Therefore, this admission of the Soviet counterattack exposed the hypocrisy of its previous statements. Today's Soviet communique spoke of fierce battles on the front lines, but the Moscow news reported that the Soviet army had taken fierce offensive actions from Kalinin to Tula, driving the German army out of several villages. Although there is currently no sign of a large-scale new offensive, the Soviet defenders have indeed gradually taken the initiative and are not allowing the German army to rest. The Soviet army is now engaging in harassing the German army's forward positions and preventing or slowing down the accumulation of its military supplies. There is often a period of time after winter when traffic is not greatly affected and the weather is not severe, but after this period, blizzards will begin and the temperature will drop sharply to forty or fifty degrees below freezing. The temperature in December always drops to this level. The second phase of winter this year came earlier, and it is now very cold. London received news that there were strong winds and heavy snow on the front lines. This kind of weather is not conducive to the German army's attack on Kerch and Sevastopol, but there are places on the Crimean Peninsula where large armies can spend the winter, because the climate in Yalta and Feodosia is quite warm.

Reuters, London, 17th - Soviet spokesman Losovsky claimed that the German troops attacking Moscow are currently building fortresses to prepare for winter warfare. According to a telegram from the Soviet News Agency, the Soviet army retreated from one village on the Kalinin front south of Moscow, but recovered four other villages. The Soviet army around Leningrad continued to counterattack the German army, driving the enemy out of their positions and inflicting heavy damage on them. The latest Soviet communique stated that there were battles on the entire front yesterday. The Soviet army in a certain area of the Kalinin front and the Southwestern front repelled a fierce attack by the German army, and the enemy suffered heavy losses in manpower and equipment.

German Troops Deepen into Crimea, Claim to Have Occupied the City of Kerch

Havas, Berlin, 16th - A radio station here has just broadcast a message claiming that German infantry has stormed into the city of Kerch at the easternmost tip of Crimea, and street fighting is now taking place in the city. As for the central route, the fierce fighting has lasted for five days, and both sides have suffered heavy casualties. On the northern route, progress has been hindered by the bad weather. The Red Army in the Leningrad area has launched a large-scale counterattack.

Haitong News Agency, 17th, German Headquarters - This afternoon's German war report claimed that the German-Romanian Allied forces in Crimea occupied the city of Kerch after a fierce battle yesterday. The eastern part of Crimea is now entirely under German control. In total, this battle captured 101,600 enemy troops.

Haitong News Agency, 17th, Berlin - Kerch, occupied by the German army yesterday, is the third largest city in Crimea, with a population of 105,000. It is located in the eastern part of Crimea, at the narrow entrance from the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The Kerch fort guards the strait. The city is the terminus of the railway, connecting the railway line from Moscow and Sevastopol to Dzhankoi. Kerch is about 100 kilometers from Feodosia, located on the Crimean southeastern coast, which was previously occupied by the German army. British military commentator Kinnate explained the military importance of Kerch on British radio. He said that the loss of the city was very serious, making it possible for the German army to invade the Caucasus. The city is about 300 kilometers from Maikop, the oil-producing center of the northern Caucasus.

Italian Troops Fighting in Ukraine, in a Difficult Situation and Urgently Awaiting Assistance

Havas, Berlin, 16th - The semi-official agency "German News Agency" has just issued a message claiming that Italian troops are fighting fiercely in the eastern part of Ukraine, and some units have penetrated deep into the Red Army's positions. However, they have encountered fierce attacks from the Red Army and are in a difficult situation and urgently awaiting assistance.

Havas, Moscow, 16th - The General Headquarters issued a war report at midnight stating that the Red Army repelled the enemy several times today in the Kalinin area on the northern route and in a certain area on the southern route. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and abandoned countless military equipment. In the past two days, the Red Army shot down more than sixty German aircraft.

### The Issue of US Military Defense Zone Handover is Being Discussed and Negotiated, to Be Decided by the Defense Force Commander's Meeting. The Date of Departure of the Fourth Regiment from Shanghai Has Not Been Disclosed. The US Consulate in Shanghai Reiterated the Withdrawal Advice Yesterday Morning.

In order to implement the State Department's order, the US Consul General in Shanghai specifically announced yesterday morning that "the previously issued advice regarding the withdrawal of US citizens has not changed." The consulate also stated that later this month, the US President's Mailboat Company will have two ships sailing directly from Shanghai to Manila, with more than 200 first-class cabins. US citizens who intend to withdraw should quickly go to the US Mailboat Company to book cabins. The names of the above two ships were not mentioned in the announcement. Whether the US defense forces will withdraw on the same ships was also not disclosed.

Handover to the Merchant Corps is Most Reasonable

Colonel Howard, commander of the US Navy Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai, issued a formal departure order to officers of all ranks of the regiment yesterday. It is expected that the army will withdraw in the coming days. When reporters inquired with the responsible parties whether the defense zone left by the US military after leaving Shanghai would be taken over by the foreign merchant corps, the answer was that this matter would depend on the results of future meetings of the defense force commanders of various countries. According to news from sources close to the concession authorities, it is likely that the International Merchant Corps will take over the defense, but a full decision has not yet been made. At a minimum, the Bureau of Public Safety will be responsible for maintaining order. The Bureau of Public Safety is currently studying whether there are any shortcomings in the International Merchant Corps' long-term deployment and how to remedy them. In any case, the peace and security within the concession will not be affected in any way. At the same time, it is heard that an agreement has been established between the Bureau of Public Safety and the British and American authorities here regarding the police authority of the US defense zone, citing the agreement established with the International Merchant Corps when the last batch of British troops withdrew in August last year, promising the Merchant Corps to patrol in the area. Regarding which party will patrol in the US military defense zone in the future, dispatching the International Merchant Corps to take over the defense is also a reasonable choice. This matter is currently being studied by the Bureau of Public Safety with the Japanese side and other authorities. Also, the rumor spread by the Japanese side that the US military in Oxford, Shanghai, will be transferred to Manila has not been confirmed by official sources here.

Two Ships Come to Shanghai with Reserved Cabins

The US Consulate General in Shanghai formally announced this morning that two ships of the US President's Company will sail from Shanghai to Manila at the end of this month, with 200 first-class berths available for US citizens to withdraw. Those who wish to withdraw should purchase tickets from the President's Steamship Company in this city. The names of the two President ships and their arrival dates in Shanghai were not disclosed, nor was the possibility of the two ships carrying US Marines withdrawing mentioned. However, according to non-official Americans, if the two ships only have 200 berths for civilians to take to withdraw, then there are still many cabins left. Therefore, it is believed that these empty cabins have been reserved to carry US Marines. The President's Company here anticipated that US citizens would flock to purchase tickets after the US Consulate announced this this morning, so it has made preparations to deal with it. It is heard that there has been no unusual withdrawal activity among US citizens recently.

British Merchants in Tianjin Discuss Withdrawal

Representatives of 24 British merchant firms in Tianjin attended a meeting held by the British Chamber of Commerce on Thursday to discuss withdrawal plans. The disposal of assets and the transfer of funds were all included in the discussions. The merchant firms attending the meeting included Jardine Matheson, Butterfield & Swire, HSBC, and Chartered Bank. The British and American funds frozen in Japanese banks in Tianjin total 6.85 million Japanese yen.

Glassford Remains in Shanghai

Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet, is currently staying in Shanghai and has been discussing defense matters with Colonel Howard, commander of the US Navy Fourth Regiment, for many days. The fleet's flagship Luzon (575 tons) is moored at the British naval buoy in the Huangpu River, while the cruisers Wake (450 tons) and Guam (370 tons) are patrolling the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

### Sixty Thousand Bags of Stockpiled Rice Released for Retail, Rice Shops Pay and Collect Certificates, People Mountain, People Sea, the Quality of Rice Sold Must Be Based on the Wishes of the Buyer

The Bean, Rice, and Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association has been instructed to register the Western rice stockpiled by members of the industry. It includes No. 1 and 2 Saigon rice, Yangon small crushed rice, Siamese rice, Yuan rice, Mindon rice, Haiphong rice, and other varieties, totaling more than 600,000 bags. Starting yesterday, various rice shops in the public concession have been paying and releasing goods separately, selling at a fixed price of 130 yuan per picul at retail outlets. Yesterday, because many rice shop personnel were unfamiliar with the payment and certificate collection procedures, and at the same time, the payment location (Wanfeng Rice Shop, No. 1 Catholic Church Street) had limited space, there were crowds of people and it was quite crowded. After the glass window wall was slightly damaged, after temporary discussions, it was moved to the second floor of the Miscellaneous Grain Association at No. 15 Avenue Edward VII from 1 pm that afternoon as the location for rice shop members to pay and collect certificates for the sale of stockpiled Western rice. The Rice Shop Association also decided to continue discussing the settlement method for Western rice purchased before the 9th today, because this matter has not been resolved yet.

Sales Method

The association yesterday reinstated two regulations for members to sell stockpiled Western rice, including: All outstanding matters of each member rice shop that paid and released goods on the 17th should complete the procedures at Wanfeng Rice Shop, No. 1 Catholic Church Street today, without delay. Because Western rice of various varieties such as fire crushed, Mindon, and Haiphong are heavier than other Western rice, each bag is one picul and three dou and a half, so when paying for the rice, a national currency of 175 yuan per bag must be topped up. As for Siamese and Saigon small crushed rice, etc., it is still 160 yuan. The association has decided to handle registration on a daily basis. All rice shops that have sold out Western rice can go to register for purchase every day. Yesterday, sixty households registered, with 4,660 bags.

Cannot Refuse to Sell

All rice shops that have released the recognized Western rice from the warehouse must sell it at the marked price at the retail outlets. Regardless of the quality of the rice, the selling price is the same. It is understood that the Food Rice Management Committee is paying close attention to the sale of stockpiled Western rice by rice shops. The sale of this Western rice by rice shops must be based on the rice needed by the rice purchasers. They must not use excuses to sell the lower-quality Western rice first. If the rice purchaser needs No. 1 Saigon, it must be measured and given as No. 1 Saigon. If they need small crushed rice, they must be measured and given as small crushed rice. If the Western rice needed by the rice purchaser is indeed sold out, then this is not an exception. However, the rice shop must immediately register with the association and continue to release goods to meet the door sales. If a rice shop has rice but refuses to sell it according to the number, anyone can report it in writing to the Food Rice Management Committee, but they must provide concrete evidence and facts.

### Exchange Settlement of Goods Limited to Absolutely Necessary Items

After the Ministry of Finance provided foreign exchange for the import of essential goods, it recently established application methods for foreign exchange. State-owned and public-owned enterprises, and joint government-business industrial and commercial enterprises, purchasing and transporting goods that are not prohibited from import and are domestically necessary, may apply to the Foreign Exchange Management Committee. After approval, they can designate the Central Bank to settle foreign exchange. For the foreign exchange needed by general private factories, firms, and individuals, they may apply to the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee. This application must be handled on behalf of the China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the fourteen friendly banks and various commercial banks that operate foreign exchange business. After approval, they will notify the designated bank to settle foreign exchange. However, the imported goods are limited to absolutely necessary items in the country. The Ministry has already issued an order to various agencies and businesses to comply.

### Materials Transported to Singapore Require a Declaration, Starting Friday

Reuters Shanghai Special Dispatch, The British Embassy has recently issued an announcement stating that, starting from Friday, November 21st, all dyed textiles and textile raw materials, chemicals, pigments, medicines, herbs and prepared medicines, paints, and colors transported from Shanghai to Singapore must be accompanied by a declaration.

### Domestic Postal Rates to Increase in Shanghai: Implementation Not Far Off; Current Discrepancies in Postal Rates are Significant, Post Office is Communicating with All Parties Involved

Domestic postal rates have already been implemented in the Southwest and Fujian-Zhejiang regions on the first of this month. Mail from Zhejiang Province delivered to Shanghai already has $0.15 postage affixed. Shanghai's delay in implementation has caused public doubt and has resulted in significant discrepancies in postal rates for mail exchange within the same country. This causes many obstacles to postal administration.

Discrepancies in Postal Rates: Although the Shanghai Postal Administration claims that it has not yet received a clear order from the General Post Office, general speculation suggests that the complexity of Shanghai's environment and the various parties involved are still being coordinated, resulting in the staggered implementation schedule. Some opportunistic merchants are already taking advantage of the fact that Shanghai has not yet implemented the price increase and are sending larger quantities of mail, which is causing a loss in postal revenue.

Summary of New Postal Rates:

In Zhejiang, Fujian, and Southwest regions, the new postal rates have already been implemented. The rates are as follows: Ordinary letter: $0.15; Registered mail: $0.63; Express mail: $0.30; Registered express mail: $0.55; Postcard: $0.08; Printed matter not exceeding 100 grams: $0.04; 100 to 250 grams: $0.08; 250 to 500 grams: $0.16; 500 grams to 1 kilogram: $0.24; 1 kilogram to 3 kilograms: $0.48.

Price Increase Within Ten Days:

According to the latest information obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter, the Shanghai Postal Administration is actively preparing for the price increase and will announce its commencement as soon as possible, not waiting until December 1. Because inland regions have already implemented the increase, the implementation date in Shanghai cannot be further delayed. Another source suggests that it is likely to be implemented this weekend or early next week.

### Over Eight Hundred Bags of European and American Mail Transported to Manila Yesterday

Mail delivery between Shanghai and the United States has become very convenient since the route was changed via Manila. The Shanghai Postal Administration dispatched a batch of mail for the United States, Canada, and various European countries yesterday at 4:00 PM, totaling over eight hundred bags. All were loaded onto ships to Manila to connect with American mail ships for onward transport.

### Authorities to Prioritize Price Controls on Chinese Necessities Such as Tofu, Straw Paper, and Tea

According to sources obtained yesterday, the authorities of the two concessions will successively announce price controls on a number of daily necessities for Chinese people. It is understood that the authorities have decided to first announce price controls on daily necessities for Chinese people, such as tofu, tea, and straw paper. It is also reported that residents can purchase various items at the published price controls from the retail stores. If any store violates the regulations or refuses to sell, residents can immediately report the store for arrest and punishment.

Coal for Industrial Use to be Controlled

The Municipal Council has issued a notice to industrial coal users stating that they should submit the minimum amount of coal needed each month, along with the current coal inventory, to the Secretary of the Coal Committee, Office No. 167, General Office of the Municipal Council, by the 20th of this month. The reported coal needs will be investigated by the Municipal Council. If any fraudulent reporting is found, disciplinary measures will be taken regarding the allocation of coal by the Municipal Council.

Bakery Prices to be Investigated

The two concession authorities have notified licensed bakeries that make white bread to provide detailed information on the cost of baking this bread and the current selling price. In the International Settlement, the information must be submitted to the Price Control Office, Office No. 171, General Office of the Municipal Council, by 5:00 PM on the 19th of this month. In the French Concession, the information should be sent to the Price Control Committee, 375 Avenue Joffre.

According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, the Xuanmeng Men's Clothing Company at 355 Sichuan Road, Central Building, was burglarized yesterday morning (16th) at 1:00 AM.

Both Skopin and Sokolovsky have prior convictions. Skopin has been imprisoned in both concessions. Kalish was recently released from Ward Road Prison. According to police disclosures, the three suspects used a delivery truck from the Ta Lai Company to travel to the location, break through the iron grille, and enter the

Xuanmeng Company.

They pried open clothing racks and drawers, stealing whatever they wanted. It is reported that during police interrogation this morning, the three suspects confessed that they broke into the Xuanmeng Company shortly after 3:00 AM yesterday morning.

### Willow Shade Printing Manager Embezzles Funds: Awaiting Verification of the Amount

Oberto Oxthwaite, a national of Honduras, a small country in South America, was working as the manager of the Willow Shade Printing Works, affiliated with the American Melintang Advertising Company at 117 Hong Kong Road. Recently, his superiors discovered that he had committed fraud and embezzled a large sum of public funds, amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The case was reported to the Central Police Station, and Western Detective Gais arrested Oxthwaite. According to the investigation, Oxthwaite used his authority to collude with others and impersonate customers to purchase the printing works' paper inventory. Oxthwaite approved the sale at pre-war market prices, and then, after a few days, another person would come forward and resell the same paper back to the printing works at the current market price. The pre-war paper prices were several times lower than the current market prices. With this back and forth, Oxthwaite earned a considerable profit. In addition, Oxthwaite concealed the death of an employee of the printing works, continuing to list the employee and receive salary payments. Therefore, yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, requested that he be temporarily detained while the exact amount was verified before filing charges. Oxthwaite also hired lawyer Wang Yaotang for his defense. Presiding Judge Feng reviewed the report and ordered Oxthwaite to be remanded to custody and adjourned the hearing.

### Impersonating Public Officials to Defraud People of Money: He Peisheng Arrested

He Peisheng, a native of Zhenjiang, is twenty-eight years old and resides at No. 2, Taihe Lane, Baille Road, French Concession. He used to work as a donation collector in the French Municipal Council. Due to his addictions and insufficient income, he engaged in private profiteering. After being discovered by the French authorities, he was suspended. Unexpectedly, He had a whimsical idea and impersonated a French Municipal Council inspector. He visited various residents in the French Concession, claiming to be investigating attic permits, and extorted money from those who had not yet obtained permits by threatening them. He then used the money to buy opium. This went on for four years. He defrauded more than 300 households. The Criminal Investigation Section of the French Police found out about it and ordered detectives to arrest He a few days ago. They also found a complete set of opium smoking paraphernalia, including a pipe and lamp, and a leather bag at his residence. During interrogation, He confessed to fraud, stating that he earned at least $400 or $500 per month. He also stated that the scheme was initially conceived by his colleague Jin Rongsheng, who has now gone to work in the interior. The police chief ordered him to be detained, pending notification of the victims to appear and be questioned.

### Naughty Children "Riding the Tram": Full of Dangers, Xiao Wenbing is a Warning Example, Parents Please Take Note

Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, a 14-year-old boy named Xiao Wenbing was killed by a British-owned Route 10 bus at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Datong Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang of the First Special Court, accompanied by a forensic doctor, went to the autopsy room on Jiaozhou Road to examine the body. It was determined that the deceased was indeed killed by a Route 10 bus. The body was released to his family for funeral arrangements. However, according to Huaguang News Agency, the deceased, Xiao Wenbing's father, runs a "tiger stove" (hot water stall) at No. 232, Shanhaiguan Road (corner of Carter Road). The deceased was a student at a primary school. On a holiday a few days ago, the deceased and three neighborhood children were playing "riding the tram" on Xinzha Road. At the time, the deceased was hanging on to the back of a Route 3 tram. When the tram reached the vicinity of Xinzha Road and Datong Road, he suddenly jumped off. A Route 10 bus was approaching from behind. Due to the suddenness, it was impossible to avoid him, and he was run over. The act of "riding the tram" is full of dangers and has always been prohibited. However, general children, not knowing the dangers, dare to commit the act. The deceased is one such example. Therefore, it is hoped that parents with children will pay close attention.

### Apprentice Dies Suddenly at Western Clothing Store: Autopsy Ordered for Further Investigation

Wu Fuzeng (18 years old, from Suzhou), an apprentice at Wang Xingchang Western Clothing Store at 807 Nanjing Road, suddenly died a few days ago. Wu Jinfu, the deceased's brother, reported to the Old Gate Police Station that his brother's death was due to injuries sustained from being beaten by Zhang Zhanglin, the Ningbo foreman of the tailor shop. Chinese Detective Tao Genrong and Detective Song Wenqing arrested Zhang, but Zhang denied the assault, stating that the deceased had a stomachache, so he was sent to Zhang's residence for treatment, but he died en route. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated that it was necessary to determine the cause of the deceased's death through an autopsy by the court's prosecutor before the facts could be clarified. Therefore, he requested permission to remand the case for further investigation. Presiding Judge Feng reviewed the report and ordered the case to be remanded for further investigation.

### Paint Workers Demand Increased Wages: Highest Wages Cannot Sustain Life

There are approximately four thousand paint workers in the city. Recently, due to rising prices and difficult living conditions, their wages are insufficient to maintain a minimum standard of living. In addition, wages in this industry are calculated on a per-job basis, and on average, each worker works for only about half a month each month, making it even more difficult to survive. Faced with this dire situation, the industry's labor union has submitted a request to the industry association, requesting that the employers improve their treatment and increase the originally stipulated daily wage of $5.20. It is believed that the employers are sympathetic to the plight of the workers and a resolution is expected soon.

### Two Robbery Cases: Each Loss Exceeds Ten Thousand Dollars

Bao Cheng Silver Shop: At around 8:00 PM last night, just as the Xin Bao Cheng Silver Shop at No. 124, Market Road, was closing, four robbers speaking a Ningbo dialect suddenly arrived, all armed with guns. They locked the staff inside the shop and ordered them not to make any noise. They stole two taels of pure gold and two hundred and fifty taels of silver, estimated to be worth $15,000. They then fled with the stolen goods.

### Nestlé Milk Products Company: Retail Address, Corrected Insecticide Prices

### People's Tuberculosis Hospital Opens Free Clinic

Since its opening, the Shanghai People's Tuberculosis Hospital has admitted a large number of free inpatients. The hospital beds have long been fully occupied, and there are still hundreds of applicants who cannot be accommodated. To provide relief to these tuberculosis patients, the hospital has established a free clinic at No. 240 North Xizang Road (corner of Kaifeng Road). Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, the clinic will provide free diagnosis and treatment for the poor suffering from tuberculosis. This is truly good news for the poor suffering from lung disease. It is reported that the hospital's expenses are entirely funded by donations from philanthropists. Donations are entrusted to the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank headquarters and various branches, Tongrun Money Shop, Fuyuan Money Shop, Huizhong Silver Shop, and other organizations for collection.

### Zhang Gunian's Painting Exhibition

Mr. Zhang Gunian's exhibition is currently open at the Ningbo Native Place Association. Mr. Zhang served as the home inspector for Mr. Feng Chaoran. From childhood, he learned painting from his uncle. He is naturally intelligent, sharp-witted, and insightful. He was already famous in the art world in his youth. All who see his paintings praise them endlessly. After the outbreak of the war, Mr. Zhang traveled to famous scenic spots in the Southwest, such as the unique landscapes of Guilin and the majestic mountains and rivers of Sichuan. Mr. Zhang verified each landscape with his own experience, realizing that what ancient masters had painted as fictional landscapes were actually real mountains and rivers. Mr. Zhang returned to Shanghai from his travels, and his painting skills greatly improved. It is truly said that ten years of studying books is not as good as traveling a thousand miles. However, Mr. Zhang is inherently lazy and unwilling to put brush to paper easily. He also dislikes the practice of self-promotion. Recently, due to the urging of friends, he has publicly exhibited his recent works on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Native Place Association for art lovers to appreciate. Mr. Zhang's paintings are based on the Four Wangs but also draw reference from various masters of the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties. Therefore, his paintings are natural and elegant, and they do not use strangeness to amaze the world. This is truly the authentic school of painting. Although Mr. Zhang has only displayed a few dozen paintings this time, all the winter landscape imitations of ancient works are exquisite and wonderful. It is difficult to find such quality. Those who love Mr. Zhang's paintings should not miss this opportunity.

Before the war, the institute published a book titled "Ten Years of Research at This Institute," which contained rich content and received high praise from society.

### Educational Situation in Anhui Province in the Past Three Years (Part 3)

The Ministry of Education paid 4,000 yuan under the ordinary education relief fund. 28th Year [of the Republic, i.e. 1939] - Restoration and Establishment: In the spring of the 28th year of the Republic, the Department of Education, in view of the excessive number of out-of-school youth in the province and the worrying consequences of prolonged lack of education, expanded the number of classes in the five provincial schools in southern Anhui and established five temporary middle schools in Jiangbei. Together with southern Anhui, there were ten provincial schools, 118 classes, and 6,000 students. At the same time, the Department of Education selected and ordered the private secondary schools in each joint county to prepare for restoration. Thirty-four schools opened one after another in compliance with the order, with a total of 140 classes and approximately 5,000 students. Subsequently, due to the unsuitable allocation of sites for the temporary provincial middle schools in Jiangbei and the excessive number of students in one school, which was inconvenient for teaching, the Department of Education adjusted and divided the classes during the summer vacation of that year, adding six schools for a total of eleven. Thirteen private middle schools in joint counties were also approved by the Ministry of Education for establishment and restoration after the summer vacation. In winter, the Department of Education convened principals and experts from all secondary schools in the province to Lihuang to hold the "Provincial Secondary Education" and "Production Education Conference," to discuss the improvement of wartime secondary education and production education in Anhui Province. Lasting for a week, more than 300 important cases were resolved. 29th Year [of the Republic, i.e. 1940] - Adjustment and Addition: In the spring of the 29th year, the Department of Education reorganized all secondary schools in the province and actively added more. As of the end of the year, there were 74 provincial, joint-county, and private secondary schools in Anhui Province, with a total of 23,512 students. The number of teachers was slightly reduced compared to before the war, while the number of students had actually exceeded 4,000.

### University Education

Founding of "Soviet-Xiao Joint Political Academy" to solve the problem of enrollment and employment of students in secondary schools throughout the province. Preparations are underway for the establishment of "Anhui Governance Academy."

Due to limited funding, it is temporarily named "Anhui Political Academy," and classes will begin soon. (End)

### Even Category C Once Reached 70 Yuan; Public Bonds Are Enthusiastically Sought After; Foreign Stocks Do Not Fall As Much As Generally Expected

The public bond gray market rose sharply yesterday. Category B broke through 70 yuan, and even reached 71 yuan. Category C also broke through the 70 yuan mark. The sentiment was excellent, and retail demand was particularly strong. Xie Xingyuan's appetite was also very strong, and the sharp drop in cotton yarn further boosted public bonds. The situation was quite good. However, rumors were uncertain after the close. The visit of Kurusu [Saburō] to the United States was feared to have no good results. There were also unfounded rumors in Shanghai. Because the rise had been very sharp, a slight fall was expected. Yesterday morning, Zhongda and Xie Xingyuan had strong buying interest. Dahua, Yichang, and Tongkang also bought in. General retail investors were particularly enthusiastic. Runde, Tongshun, Senji, Datong, and Yitai were all selling. Category C opened at 68.1 yuan, immediately rising by four jiao [cents], gradually rising to 69.6 yuan. Sentiment was extremely strong. In the afternoon, Xie Xingyuan continued to buy in. Dingkang, Houda, and Hongda also had needs. It quickly broke through the 70 yuan mark, hovering around 70 yuan several times. Later, as Jiufeng sold more and more, the multiple parties slightly retreated. As a result, the market price generally rose by 1.1 yuan to 1.9 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Category  Highest  Lowest  Closing  Compared to Previous Day

Unified A  76.30  74.50  76.00  Up 1.65

Unified B  71.50  70.00  71.10  Up 1.80

Unified C  70.30  68.10  69.60  Up 1.90

Unified D  66.20  65.00  65.70  Up 1.10

Unified E  69.80  67.80  69.00  Up 1.50

In stock trading, 100 shares of Ning Shao Shipping Company were traded at a price of 19 yuan.

The public market of Zhongye Public Institute rose and fell sharply, doing its best to change. The opening price did not fall sharply as expected by most people at the end of the week. The fall was less than 10 percent. The fear of the multiple parties gradually disappeared with the stability of other markets in the past two days. Therefore, shortly after opening, buying interest was revived, and the market rose instead of falling. By the time of closing at noon, the prices of various stocks had gradually exceeded the closing prices on Friday of last week. In the afternoon, it finally fell due to excessive gains, but the potential was still strong.

### Rumors of Banks Suspending Loan Collateral; Gold Prices Plunge

Yesterday, the spot red market for cash rebounded sharply and prices fell. Prices have retreated to within the 20,000 yuan mark. This is because it is widely rumored that banks have stopped making gold-backed loans. The confiscation of gold bars by customs on the Tianjin-Shanghai route confirms that gold is being transported to Shanghai. The Tianjin and Hong Kong gangs are selling a lot, so banks are still taking advantage of the opportunity to raise prices. Market prices have repeatedly fallen from 21,000 yuan to nearly the 19,000 yuan mark, with a low of 19,100 yuan, a sharp drop of 1,600 yuan. The market sentiment is very weak. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,400 taels. Jewelry fell by 60 yuan, totaling 2,000 yuan. Fine silver was lowered by 2 yuan, to 26 yuan. The gray market has fallen to 23.4 yuan.

Cash Enters the 20,000 Yuan Mark

From the morning, the market price of each bar (10 taels) was initially reduced to the 20,000 yuan mark for transactions due to the selling trend of Gonghe and other sellers, when there was a shortage of buyers. This was 1,300 yuan less than the noon close on Saturday of last week. After opening, Tianyuan, Mingfeng, and Dafeng began buying, which led to a sharp rebound. In an instant, it rose by 1,000 yuan, reaching 21,000 yuan. However, market sentiment was not strong. When Tianyuan came out again, Shih He, Yifeng, Yongcheng, and Xianghe also came to sell. Later, Mingfeng also sold. The price fell lower and lower, falling to 19,100 yuan. Although De Cheng, Li Tai, Mingfeng, and Tianyuan raised prices to 19,500 yuan, Shish He sold out. The noon close was 19,300 yuan. After the close, it retreated to 19,150 yuan, and finally 19,200 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 PM at 19,450 yuan, 150 yuan higher than expected. Next was 19,500 yuan. Xianghe and Shunyuan came to sell, falling to 19,200 yuan. Mingfeng, Dafeng, and Defu saw low prices and raised prices, rising by 550 yuan to reach 19,750 yuan. The market closed at 4:00 PM at 19,700 yuan, a decrease of 1,600 yuan compared to the noon close on Saturday of last week. The high and low for the day was 900 yuan. The selling price of the Jinniu cash shop was 19,900 yuan, 200 yuan lower than the purchase price.

Jewelry Down 160

After the price of jewelry per tael was exchanged, Datonghang and Xintonghang first reduced the price to 2,000 yuan in the morning, then rebounded to 2,050 yuan. It then fell to 1,960 yuan at noon, and rebounded to 2,000 yuan in the afternoon. The purchase price was reduced by 150 yuan, and the spot price was down 160 yuan. Fine silver has been lowered by 2 yuan, to 26 yuan. The black market has fallen to 23.4 yuan.

### Black Market for Foreign Exchange Eliminated; Only Selling, No Buyers in Private Check Transactions

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw flat listings from HSBC and the Central Bank. The prices of small counters such as HSBC did not change. The black market for British and American currencies has been officially and completely eliminated, with no price and no market. It was only heard that a Chinese broker in New York was offering US dollars at 3 yuan, and a British exchange was offered at 2 1/8 (also checked in the United States). There were sellers, but no buyers to offset them. No transactions were opened all day.

The foreign currency market yesterday saw both rises and falls. British and American gold pounds fell by 25 yuan each along with the cash price. British gold notes rose by 1 or 2 yuan. American gold notes once retreated to 31.5 yuan, with the final price being 33.3 yuan, up 0.1 yuan compared to last week. Hong Kong notes fell before rising. Japanese gold notes rose by 3 jiao [cents]. The evening market was as high as 3.5 yuan. Korean notes were stable. The evening market remained at the original price of 3.1 yuan.

### Despite Price Controls on Various Items, Cotton Yarn Still Hits the Upper Limit

The yarn market, which had been falling for several days, rebounded yesterday. However, actual transactions were still sluggish. In fact, the factory price of Shuangma has fallen by 800 yuan from its peak, which has led to profiteers covering their positions. With a tight market, the market price quickly rebounded. The highest price of 20-count Shuangma was 2,640 yuan, and the lowest price was 2,410 yuan.

The market sentiment for Shuangma was mostly optimistic at the opening in the morning. The first trade was high by 20 or 30 yuan, at 2,510 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 2,545 yuan. After the high price appeared, active sellers began shorting. The opening of the exchange was also weak, and the selling pressure was strong. The market price then fell back to 2,450 yuan. In the second trade, the exchange suddenly rose, and the market sentiment followed, rising beyond the 500 yuan mark. Unexpectedly, the third close saw a pullback, and market sentiment was tired, falling back to 2,455 yuan. Unexpectedly, near 11:30, the trading wind in the market suddenly became fierce. There were quite a few buyers in the market, and the market price rose directly to 2,560 yuan, announcing an upper limit. The closing price was 2,538 yuan. It is estimated that 3,800 bales were traded in the first half of the morning.

The opening price in the afternoon was 2,520 yuan. Subsequently, due to the few sellers on the market and the large number of buyers, the chips were drying up. The yarn and cloth market of the exchange rose in a straight line. Market sentiment became stronger, and the market price rose to 2,640 yuan, declaring an upper limit. The final price outside the market was 2,615 yuan.

The futures market for Jin Shuangma has fallen to a relatively low level after a continuous decline. Although international trends are tense, most of the news is negative. Therefore, it is difficult to support under the panic of multiple parties. They successively came out. Although there were rumors of the withdrawal of US troops and other unfavorable rumors yesterday, the market trend was straight up. This is because the market price was too low, which attracted speculative attacks. In the afternoon, the factory prices rose sharply, and the long-term yarn also rose by more than 200 yuan. The recent term opened at 2,260 yuan in the morning, first rising by 35 yuan, then slightly falling to 2,195 yuan, and immediately rising again to 2,300 yuan. At the noon close, December opened at 2,380 yuan, once slightly lower, then rose again to 2,490 yuan. The distant term opened at 2,48 yuan at the noon close and rose slowly to 2,570 yuan. In the afternoon, as rumors improved, market sentiment was mostly excited. The margin was mostly long, so each month was nearly the high price. As a result, November rose by 185 yuan, December rose by 200 yuan, and January also rose by 200 yuan. A table is listed below.

November December January

Opening 2260.0 2280.0 2480.0

Highest 2425.0 2570.0 2650.0

Lowest 2195.0 2570.0 2460.0

Closing 2410.0 2565.0 2650.0

Comparison Rise 185.0 Rise 200.0 Rise 10.0

### Cotton Prices Stabilize

Yesterday, the spot cotton situation stabilized slightly with the yarn market. Transactions were slightly more active. However, prices were approximately 50 yuan lower than the previous week. In the afternoon, due to favorable rumors, the prices of yarn and cloth showed an upward trend, and market sentiment was revived.

Langgong 200 pieces 550.0 Haoshijia also 100 pieces 550.0 also

The New York cotton market rose first due to purchases by peers, and then fell due to sales from New Orleans and the liquidation of bulls. As a result, the closing price was 5 or 6 pounds different from the previous day.

The Indian cotton market fell first due to sales by professional merchants and the liquidation of bulls, and then rose slightly due to the strong rise in other vegetable raw materials such as flax and flax. However, the market situation finally fell due to the continued selling of oversupply. Yesterday's closing price fell by about 1 rupee each. It is also predicted that the market situation will fall by 0.25 rupees at the opening today.

### Piece Goods Strive to Show Off

The factory cloth market opened flat yesterday, and rebounded in the afternoon. This was because market sentiment had stabilized slightly, and both new long positions and short covering were carried out. As a result, white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill rose by 3 to 5 yuan per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth also rose by about 5 yuan. Dyeing factories and wholesale shops on this street rushed to purchase. Transactions were even more active in the afternoon, with more than 600 pieces traded. Customer support purchased more than 300 pieces. This was thoughtful trading.

Eastern Cloth The market rose sharply yesterday with the rise in yarn. The price of each piece of cloth in the exchange rose sharply by 6 yuan, 0.1 fen to 6.2 jiao. The leading fine cloth and the Four Gentlemen serge in the spot market fell before rising, with sharp edges. The closing price of the leader's factory order in the afternoon was 92 yuan, a rebound of 7 yuan from the end of last week. The smallest price of the Four Gentlemen serge in the morning was 3.03 yuan, and it rose sharply to 3.415 yuan in the afternoon, closing back to 3.37 yuan.

### Publicly Sold Rice Continues to Arrive; Foreign Flour Lacks Energy

Foreign rice was unloaded from the Taikoo Company's Qiongzhou Wheel from Hong Kong yesterday morning, with 10,200 bags of foreign rice, which are the low-priced small grains of the Public Concession. The wheel is now docked at the Pudong Wharf and will be moved to the Bund Wharf in Puxi for unloading within days.

In yesterday's rice market, foreign rice transactions were still completely suspended except for the gradual increase in the transaction of national rice. Normal transactions can be resumed only after the Public Concession issues instructions.

The flour market became more and more sluggish and listless yesterday. Tens of thousands of bags of foreign flour stored by the Beiyang Gang a few days ago were unable to be shipped out because they did not have the Public Concession's export permit. Customers not only lack the motivation to buy, but also want to sell. As for this street, in addition to a few necessities, most are waiting for the public sale of flat flour before adding supplies. Therefore, after the Golden Dragon brand was lowered to 36 or 37 yuan, there were still only a few decorations. Large households depreciated the price to 35 yuan, but there were still few takers. According to the highest opening price of the Jinlong brand, which was 60 yuan, the price has fallen by more than 41% at 35 yuan. However, wheat bran is in short supply and the price is standing firm. Small bags of wheat bran are sold for 54 yuan, and it has risen by half a yuan again.

### Wholesale of Oil Market Lacking

Yesterday, there were few wholesale transactions of miscellaneous grains, oil, and cakes, and most people were watching. Therefore, the market price fluctuated and there was little change. Tongshi sold 10 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 100 tins of Yantai raw oil, 300 tins of Jiangbei raw oil, and 150 tins of bean oil, 30 barrels of Dalian bean oil, 200 loads of Dayou factory Qing buckets, 100 loads of rapeseed oil, and 50 barrels of Rihua factory rapeseed oil. There are approximately 1,000 bags of corn in spot, and 50 tons in futures. There are still 100 yuan of Tianjin New Jinyuan asking to sell, and 923 yuan of green beans and 83 yuan of Guide Chen soybeans, but no transactions were made.

On the 17th, 5,560 bags of imported beans and 1,850 bags of raw peanuts were imported, all from Tianjin.

### Candied Tangerines Offer New

There had been no candied tangerines arriving for a long time because the old stock had been sold out. Therefore, the demand in northern China during the Mid-Autumn Festival was very urgent, but there were no goods to buy. Now that the production area has new goods, the first batch of dozens of pieces has been shipped to Shanghai for market testing. It was heard yesterday that the price was higher than the old goods by several hundred yuan.

On the 17th, northern goods were imported: 235 bags of walnuts, 8 bags of almonds, 400 bags of peanuts, and 280 bags of chestnuts, all shipped from Tianjin.

### Isn't This a Great Opportunity? Major Players Buy Sugar at Low Prices

Yesterday, the sugar market initially stagnated due to the opening of the company's futures market. Investor confidence was weak, and prices continued to fall. Later, as prices reached a considerable low, major players took the opportunity to buy, causing prices to rebound. The price difference reached as much as twenty-three to twenty-four yuan. The market seems to show signs of recovery. The October import price of the General Association's spot No. 24 raw white sugar started at 234 yuan in the morning, then dropped to 26 yuan, rose to 40 yuan in the middle, and then settled at 32 yuan. In the afternoon, it steadily climbed from 37 yuan to 49 yuan. September's prices ranged from 23 yuan to 35 yuan in the morning, and from 34.5 yuan to 47 yuan in the afternoon. Hong Kong raw sugar ranged from 205 yuan to 220 yuan. Dutch red sugar started at a minimum of 186 yuan, then rose to 90 yuan, and in the afternoon, it ranged from 91 yuan to 200 yuan. Taikoo refined white HX mark sugar was priced at 205 yuan. In the end, raw white sugar rose by fourteen to fifteen yuan to ten yuan, Dutch red sugar rose by fifteen yuan, and refined white sugar rose by five yuan. Total transactions exceeded 15,000 bags.

A large batch of imported sugar has arrived. Taikoo Company's Jia Ying and Qiong Zhou vessels arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 12,000 bags of sugar from Hong Kong. The Jia Ying vessel carried 5,600 bags, and the Qiong Zhou vessel carried 6,400 bags. They docked at our company's wharf in Yangjiadu, Pudong, for unloading. (Hua)

### Strong Demand for Black Tea for Medicinal Purposes

In the past two days, transactions of foreign black and green tea have become increasingly scarce. This is due to the tense situation in the Pacific and the difficulty in securing space on American ships, causing American sales to virtually halt. However, sales to stores and tea merchants have become more active recently. Yesterday, merchants from Tianjin purchased more than 260 packages of fried green tea, priced from 300 yuan to 320 yuan. In addition, the sales of black tea cores are even brisker. Besides large purchases by stores, local Western pharmacies have a greater need for them. Yesterday, 170 dan were traded, with the market price soaring from 1780 yuan to 230-240 yuan, an unprecedented high price.

### Old-fashioned Weapons of Animals

— Jian Nong

Living in this world of survival of the fittest, an animal, if it doesn't want its species to become extinct, must be equipped with a superior weapon, whether for offense or defense. In reality, there is no such thing as new or old among these various weapons. Classifying them strongly into new and old is merely judging them from our own perspective. I will now select a few interesting ones to write about below. As for tiger claws, wolf fangs, horse hooves, bull horns, etc., of course, they are too numerous to mention.

Lance

In the Arctic Sea, there is a type of cetacean called the "Narwhal." It is about sixteen to seventeen feet long, shaped like a fish, grayish-white in color, with countless spots on its back and flanks. However, the most peculiar thing is the long lance protruding from the upper lip of the male – a tooth! – This lance is about eight to nine feet long, made of ivory, delicate and solid, standing straight forward, and the shaft is also decorated with rope-like patterns that twist to the left! What is this thing for if not for battle? That's why I say this is a warrior wielding a lance.

Saw

In the Mediterranean or Atlantic Ocean, there is a strange-looking fish belonging to the shark family called the "Sawfish," also known as "Sawshark." This fellow is about two zhang long, with a reddish-brown back and very broad pectoral and pelvic fins. But the most surprising thing is its deformed long snout: this snout can grow to more than six feet long, flattened, with countless neat and sharp teeth arranged on the upper and lower sides. Wouldn't you say this is a large saw? A French natural scientist named Lacepede in the early nineteenth century described its story of attacking whales, so one can imagine its danger!

Sword Wielding

The powerful weapon of a crab is the pliers formed by the first pair of front legs, which, once clamped, will not let go. These are called "crab claws," or what people now commonly call "pincers offensive." However, there is a small brownish-yellow crab, only two inches in size, whose male has one claw that is particularly long, reaching two to three inches. Zuo Si's commentary says that it is "as sharp as a sword," so it is called "sword-wielding." Duan Chengshi's "Youyang Zazu" says that its two claws are used "to fight with the larger one and to eat with the smaller one." ... We can imagine how majestic this sword-wielding hero must be when fighting in the water!

Axe Wielding

"Youyang Zazu" says: "The mantis has an axe." The Song Dynasty scholar Lu Dian explained: "People in Yan call it 'giant axe.' Its arms are like axes, and when swung, they always strike without avoiding..." According to the description of French insect experts: the shuttle-shaped section in the middle of the mantis's forelimbs is actually a large saw with two layers of serrated teeth; the outer layer has four serrations, the inner layer has twelve serrations, black and long, green and short, alternating in length, and three sharp needles at the rear. The last section is also a saw with two layers of serrated teeth, but the teeth are smaller and denser. The limb ends also extend sharp and curved scythes. Therefore, the mantis uses its forelimbs to hook, pierce, cut, tear, and pull, truly a perfect and dangerous weapon. Fabre said that the mantis is a fierce tiger and demon in the peaceful insect world! According to Thomson, the mantis in South America is strong enough to catch a small bird!

Shooting

Among marine plankton, there is a colorless and slender rod-shaped small worm, about two and a half centimeters long, with bristles and small spines on its head, and lateral fins on both sides of its body. This thing not only looks like an arrow, but its movement and predation are also sudden advances, just like an arrow flying from a bow, so it is called "arrow worm": it may not be entirely unreasonable to use it as an archer now.

Snaring

The definition of the word "yi" is: "to shoot with an arrow tied with a rope." This kind of weapon can also be found in animals. For example, those bizarre chameleons that are good at changing colors each possess a long tongue longer than their bodies: usually curled up and hidden in the mouth, when it encounters a preyable insect, it suddenly bursts out like a whirlwind and returns like lightning, because the tip of the tongue secretes an extremely viscous liquid, and insects rarely escape being carried away by it. According to records of the biological world, there is a type of chameleon in southern Spain that is only five to six inches long but can use its tongue to capture objects eight to nine inches away, and it only takes a few tenths of a second to go back and forth!

Life

### Record of Failure

— Feile

This young man is preparing to take his first step in life. His mind is drawing a beautiful "Road of Life":

Blue sky: no sign of rain.

Spring breeze is blowing,

Flowers and grass surround:

A half-flat and wide road.

Adorned with happiness, peace, and success,

Leading straight to the other end!

He doesn't feel his impulsiveness at all, he thinks there really is such a road waiting for a group of lucky people. Who says that an ideal life is not what people should have?

He starts walking.

The waves of life begin to hit this proud young man. He opens his eyes and realizes a little: the sky is not always blue every moment!

Taking another step:

He encounters a great mountain, towering into the clouds; he encounters deep water, flooding the ocean, and his feet cannot help but stop!

Perhaps he hopes for an airplane to carry him over, a steamer to ferry him across, but; the high mountain tells him that the successful climb up by grasping vines.

The deep water tells him that the successful swim across.

Strength, sweat, blood, tears, he exchanged for a new understanding:

"Only through struggle can there be a way out."

Struggle is not always a victory. Failure follows him continuously. He resents failure, once, twice, again and again, he becomes discouraged, he becomes somewhat passive?

But, when he understands the true meaning of life, he no longer hates failure. Every failure becomes a precious record.

——Oh, how many times have I failed! Not a sigh, but a cheer! He might even say like Steele:

"I doubt whether this success is reliable, because 'failure' is not enough to record!"

He did not tear up the picture drawn on his mind, he said:

"The blue sky is not absent, the flowers and grass are fragrant and beautiful!

The road of life has happiness and peace!

But, all this is earned through struggle – fighting

Even more so, it is exchanged for;

Gray skies, thorny roads, tears, sweat, and blood

——Records of failure!"

Finally,

He ends his life with a metaphor:

"This steed has finally won!

But, can you see the whip marks on its flanks?

Life is a race, not a lottery!"

— Yongyun

To keep the exquisitely woven sofas and cushions on display in stores intact and clean, there is now a transparent rubber cover. This cover can also be used at home because it can keep the sofa clean without losing its beauty. Even sitting on it will not damage the cover. Moreover, this cover is non-flammable, odorless, washable, and durable.

Fourteen: The Life of a Hero

But when he returned to the small inn where he was staying, he absolutely did not shed another tear. On the contrary, he put on a happy face and ate the bowl of noodle soup that Mei Bao had prepared for him in three or four mouthfuls.

"My interpersonal relationships are not bad. My colleagues are very kind to me and willing to take care of me." He leaned back on the couch, looking at Mei Bao, who was cleaning up the chopsticks and bowls. "People who sing in Shanghai, after coming off stage, all like to show off. I've been out of practice for more than ten years, so the first day I went on stage, I inevitably felt particularly tired." "Hopefully, it will get better in a few days," Mei Bao said casually.

"I'm afraid it won't be easy!" The future hidden worries are deeply buried in Qiu Haitang's heart. Although he doesn't want to say it, he can't help but think of it immediately.

This thought is certainly correct! The situation on the second night and the third night did not improve at all. The insults from his colleagues and the excessive fighting almost made Qiu Haitang fall ill.

Fortunately, the martial arts manager saw through Zhang Yincai's intentions on the third day and knew that he had mistakenly thought that Qiu Haitang was someone he had introduced, so he deliberately caused trouble. However, he was still the martial arts manager, and Zhang Yincai was just a martial arts leader. They had always had some grievances with each other, so he certainly couldn't speak well for Qiu Haitang directly to him. (265)

### Wisdom

— Mingyi

History teaches wisdom, but not everyone is learning. Fabre

Science teaches us how to cure diseases and how to kill lives. It fragmentarily reduces the mortality rate and then kills us in batches in war; but only wisdom – a desire organized by all experiences – can tell us when to cure diseases and when to kill. Durant

Silence is like a marble statue that a great sculptor has not yet started to carve, full of potential intelligence and wisdom. Huxley

### Writing Before the Premiere of Princess Iron Fan

— Liyi

China's first full-length stereoscopic cartoon with sound, "Princess Iron Fan," is about to be released, which is exciting news! The preparation and shooting of "Princess Iron Fan" started several years ago, and the production work has taken years and months, exhausting the efforts of the Wan brothers and 120 artists to complete. This also shows how meticulous and solemn the filming of the film is!

This is a unique flower in the Chinese film industry! This is a kind of attempt by Chinese filmmakers, and there is no doubt that this new attempt will not fail. We admit that Chinese films are far more immature than those in Europe and America, but we have our own path. Does immaturity not have a time to mature?

After watching "Snow White," "Pinocchio," "Gulliver's Travels," and other full-length cartoons, even if we don't gasp in admiration, we should at least be amazed by the great achievements of film art. The artistic evaluation of cartoon films should be above ordinary films. Can we say that? The achievements of "Princess Iron Fan" are not yet clear to the public, but we think it will not disappoint, because it is not a crudely made film. Some Chinese films are often crudely made products, which cannot but be regrettable!

The special commendable point of cartoon films, in addition to the moving images and pleasant music, seems to be the exaggeration of the plot. Therefore, in terms of subject matter, fairy tales are the most suitable. However, if you say that cartoons must be fairy tales, it is certainly not necessarily correct! Here, we have a request, and we hope that Chinese cartoon authors will accept it, that is, the subject matter may as well be fairy tales, but if, in order to cater to the tastes of a small number of people, the content is overly entertaining, resulting in the loss of educational significance, then this mistake is by no means insignificant. Because, although not all viewers of cartoons are children, it is absolutely true that children love cartoons. If a cartoon only gives children "laughter and a few cheers," isn't this a waste? Of course, "Princess Iron Fan" is definitely not this type of film.

Secondly, we hope that the Great Shanghai and Huguang theaters will have a special preferential treatment for children when "Princess Iron Fan" is released, and do not have the exceptional provision of "full tickets for children" as when "Snow White" was released. In this way, children will naturally have more opportunities. Finally, in addition to sincerely introducing "Princess Iron Fan," we also sincerely hope that the Wan brothers and 120 artists will make greater efforts to create works even greater than "Princess Iron Fan"!

### Why Did Ah Q Die?

— Beishi

This is indeed a question, why did Ah Q die? Of course, Mr. Lu Xun used the typical figure in the small rural village—Ah Q—to expose the society in the feudal system, and to painfully criticize the general national character. With Ah Q's death, he hoped that the Ah Q in everyone's consciousness would die, but why did Ah Q have to die?

Was it for joining the revolutionary party? No, was it for robbing the Zhao family? No, was it for molesting Wu Ma? No, let alone the reason for being shot. Everyone knows that Ah Q died, but they don't know why Ah Q died, what was the crime? Mr. Chen Yu's adaptation of "The True Story of Ah Q" is divided into five acts. In the fifth act, he even collected Mr. Lu Xun's works outside of "The True Story of Ah Q," such as "Diary of a Madman" and "Medicine," and interspersed them in the play. Therefore, for Ah Q himself, it is easy for the audience to despise the past, and thus he dies in a muddle. Although, everyone knows that he himself shouted: Twenty years later, I will be a good man again!

"That's right, I know that the robber was not Ah Q, but, alas, Mr. Zhao, to be honest, I have been in office for so many days, and these petty things have not yet been solved, so, my reputation, wouldn't it be bad? Everyone would say that this Qian director is simply a piece of trash, who can't even manage the security of a small village properly. What great things can he do in the future? He even spent so much money to study law and politics abroad. In this way, alas, Mr. Zhao, you think, wouldn't it be terrible? Therefore, I chose Ah Q to be a scapegoat—anyway, this guy is a poor rogue with no home, no room, no support!"

Do you understand now, Ah Q's death?

Chapter Nineteen: Dusk, the Hu Cavalry Dust the City

The reason why San Gui said this was that he wanted to ask the Qing army not to violate anything, not to disturb the officials and people, and to avoid the ugliness of him opening the door to welcome the invaders. How did he know that Dor Ershui also had great expectations for entering the pass this time, and wanted to do some hypocritical things to win people's hearts, and could no longer plunder as a means as in previous battles. Moreover, the opponents were bandits who were accustomed to slaughtering, so of course he had to make it clear so that he could distinguish them, and also let the people of the Ming Dynasty not resent their brutality, and feel that they were replacing violence with violence. There was no need for Wu Sangui to teach them anymore. After Wu Sangui issued the book, scouts repeatedly reported that the Qing army was approaching Shanhaiguan. It was also heard that the bandit Li Zicheng personally led a large army across the Ao River, and marched mightily towards Shanhaiguan. He then ordered the vanguard Ma Bao and Bai Xianzong's two armies to move as quickly as possible to the right wing. He heard that the bandits had left the pass from another road, and the situation was urgent, so he and Chai Ying led 500 personal guards to the outside of the pass to ask Prince Regent Dor Ershui to move his troops into the pass. Dor Ergun's subordinates strongly advocated that when the bandits launched a large-scale attack, they could send a mighty army to raid Juyongguan from another road, and directly attack the capital. The capital was empty and could be obtained easily. If the bandits returned to rescue, they could be captured in one fell swoop. However, Sangui still insisted on entering the pass to fight the bandits because the bandits were approaching, and the situation at the gate was urgent. Dor Ergun then ordered Prince Ying Ajige and Prince Yu Duoduo to lead 10,000 cavalry each to enter the pass from the east and west water gates. He personally led the main force to follow. Sangui was overjoyed, so he returned to Shanhaiguan to prepare to welcome the Qing troops. On the 23rd day of April, the Qing army had opened to Shanhaiguan. (222)
