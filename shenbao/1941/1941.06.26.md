### U.S. Considers Expanding Army Personnel

United Press, Washington, 25th - General Marshall, Chief of Staff of the Army, stated yesterday that the War Department intends to request authorization from Congress to expand the army to 1.8 million men (originally 100,000), in addition to retaining a certain number of drafted personnel currently in service. He stated that deploying a certain number of elite troops in Alaska and other remote locations is particularly necessary.

Havas, Washington, 24th - The Navy Department announced that all officers and enlisted personnel in the U.S. Navy must enlist for service during this "time of war."

### U.S. Takes Concrete Steps to Aid Soviet Union - Orders Unfreezing of Soviet Funds - Allows Military Supplies in the U.S. or Elsewhere - Treasury Dept. Issues Permits to Ship Goods to Soviet Union

United Press, Washington, 25th (Urgent Telegram) - President Roosevelt has promised to help the Soviet Union as much as possible. At the same time, the State Department unfroze $40 million in Soviet funds in the U.S. to express sympathy for the Soviet Union's war against Germany. While President Roosevelt indicated that he would begin aiding the Soviet Union with goods soon, he also stated that he was unaware of what the Soviet Union needed and what tools and materials the U.S. could provide. He also said that the Soviet Union had not yet provided a list of needed items to the U.S. The President pointed out that ordering aircraft and heavy weaponry takes time. He also stated that the U.S. production capacity was already at its maximum effort. The President indicated that the first batch of U.S. aid to the Soviet Union would be common supplies, such as leather shoes. The President also stated that he could not predict whether the aid to the Soviet Union would be incorporated into the Lend-Lease Act, or whether the U.S. would require the Soviet Union to pay for it. The President also said that he did not know if the U.S. would prioritize sending aircraft and other weapons to the Soviet Union. When discussing the State Department's unfreezing of $40 million in Soviet funds, the President said that the Soviet Union could use it to purchase goods in the U.S.

Reuters, Washington, 25th - The U.S. Treasury Department has revoked the order issued on June 14th to freeze Soviet funds in the U.S. Yesterday, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, at the request of the State Department and after consulting with the Justice Department, signed an order to unfreeze Soviet funds in the U.S. This is the first concrete step taken by the U.S. to aid the Soviet Union in resisting Germany. The Soviet Union can use its unfrozen funds to procure military supplies in the U.S. or elsewhere. It is widely believed that the unfrozen funds, including cash, securities, and property, amount to 100 million U.S. dollars.

United Press, Washington, 35th [sic, should be 25th] - The Treasury Department announced yesterday that it has issued a blanket permit for the transportation of various goods to the Soviet Union, without requiring a formal guarantee that these goods will not be transshipped to other countries. The Treasury Department explained, "Recent events involving the Soviet Union have made such a guarantee unnecessary."

United Press, Washington, 25th - Observers say that the U.S. President's informal approval of possible aid to the Soviet Union, and the Treasury Department's unfreezing of Soviet deposits, could lead to the early resumption of shipments of goods from the U.S. West Coast and the Philippines to the Soviet Union. Well-informed sources believe that the Soviet Union will be able to immediately resume the purchase of Philippine coconut oil, ramie, and other goods. This purchase had previously been prohibited due to the implementation of export controls. Export control administrator Maxwell had previously said that this action would not be taken for the time being until the White House announced its policy.

British-Soviet Military Cooperation Based on Mutual Assistance

Reuters, London, 25th - Preparations are currently underway as quickly as possible to send a British military and economic delegation to the Soviet Union. It is expected to be ready soon. Sir Stafford Cripps, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, who has been consulting and discussing matters day and night since arriving in London, hopes to return to Moscow within a few days. This British preparation began after the Soviet Union accepted the proposal to send a British delegation. Cripps will direct British aid to the Soviet Union. British and Soviet authorities have agreed that cooperation will be based on mutual assistance.

Haitong News Agency, Turkish Capital, 25th - According to news from Jerusalem, a British military delegation flew from Cairo to Moscow on the 23rd, landing briefly in Baghdad. It is reported that the mission of this British military delegation is to establish contact between the British and Soviet General Staffs.

Reuters, Moscow, 25th - The British Chargé d'Affaires in Moscow, Baggalay, met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky yesterday afternoon.

Reuters, London, 25th - Minister Attlee stated in a broadcast last night that the British and Soviet governments have a common interest in defeating Hitler and will

### American Volunteers Allowed to Serve in China and Britain - But Only on Condition of Not Swearing Allegiance - Rumor Says U.S. to Establish Base in China

United Press, Washington, 25th - President Roosevelt gave American volunteers the official "green light"—the so-called traffic light—to engage in any service in China and Britain, on the condition that they do not swear allegiance to those countries. The President has advocated that Americans join the technical direction work of the British military "but insists that they cannot swear allegiance to the British King." In answering people's inquiries, the President said that Americans who wish to serve as volunteers in China and Britain do not violate neutrality laws, and that this action is completely legal. The President pointed out that American citizens are free to serve in China and Britain as radio operators, aviators, doctors, technicians, or even combatants. It is generally believed that the President's remarks are very important in clarifying the Administration's attitude and policy towards volunteers, as they are sufficient to encourage Americans to take on various jobs in China and Britain in the near future, and may allow American aviators to resign from active duty in the U.S. and join the Chinese and British air forces. The President's remarks were made after the recent report that the U.S. Army announced that many air force personnel could resign from their positions and go to serve in China. However, the President yesterday also insisted that the U.S. prohibition against foreigners serving as volunteers still exists.

United Press, Tokyo, 25th - The Asahi Shimbun today published a report from Nanjing stating that the United States is currently attempting to build an air base in China to threaten Japan in the event of a crisis between the U.S. and Japan. It also stated that the U.S. has dispatched 120 American pilots to China, including many American-born Chinese.

### Japanese Military and Political Personnel Hold Special Joint Meeting - To Announce Foreign Policy Today - Tojo Admits Japan Wandering Astray - U.S. and China Predict Japan Will Attack Vladivostok

United Press, Tokyo, 25th - Japanese government officials and senior command representatives held a special joint meeting this afternoon to discuss important current issues. After the meeting, the cabinet immediately held a special cabinet meeting to mainly discuss the situation caused by the Soviet-German war. The holding of these two special meetings may be due to the receipt of news of Nazi victories over the Soviet Red Army. On this point, the government may clarify its foreign policy earlier than previously expected. Although the issues discussed at the meeting have not been announced, it is believed that the main topic of discussion is the impact of the Soviet-German war on Japan. Government representatives attending the joint chiefs of staff meeting included Prime Minister Konoe, Foreign Minister Matsuoka, Interior Minister Hiranuma, Army Minister Tojo, and Navy Minister Kawa. Senior command representatives included Army Chief of Staff Sugiyama and Navy Chief of Staff Nagano.

United Press, Tokyo, 25th - The Japanese government will announce its foreign policy regarding the Soviet-German war tomorrow. Prime Minister Konoe reported on current affairs discussed at this afternoon's special cabinet meeting to the Emperor, and then consulted with Privy Seal Kido. Whenever the two consult, there is always an important policy decision or a cabinet change, but there is no sign of a cabinet change at this time. Reporters were officially notified that police have begun a special campaign to prevent rumors during the special cabinet meeting on policy. The cabinet decided at today's afternoon meeting that special meetings will be convened at any time when necessary, in view of the rapid changes in the international situation.

United Press, Tokyo, 25th - Japanese Army Minister Tojo gave a speech to the munitions industry today, which was his first public statement since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, and is therefore highly valued. He stated, "Due to the outbreak of war between the Soviet Union and Germany, the world situation has become more complex than before, and there is a risk of war spreading globally. The future attitude of the United States is also unpredictable. Japan's destiny is in a stray path." Tojo urged munitions industrialists to make greater efforts to adapt to the Army's plan to cope with the current serious international situation.

United Press, Chongqing, 25th - Chinese top authorities held a meeting yesterday to discuss the Soviet-German war. Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui also reported the situation to the Executive Yuan in detail yesterday. According to some sources, Chinese officials believe that Japan plans to attack Sakhalin Island, Vladivostok, and the Primorsky Krai as soon as possible in order to eliminate the Soviet Union's threat to Japan for many years. However, Tokyo has not yet fully decided on this plan.

United Press, Washington, 25th - Well-informed circles here predicted yesterday that if the Soviet Union collapses before the German attack, Japan may invade Siberia. Japan will not take decisive action on the Soviet-German war until the strength of the Red Army and the Nazis has been clearly tested. They also said that the danger of Japan advancing south to invade the Dutch East Indies and Singapore has now disappeared. The Soviet-German war has brought the war closer to the Western Hemisphere and made the Western Hemisphere an area reachable by artillery fire, as the tip of Alaska is only thirty miles from Siberia. However, in fact, the war has not yet come into contact with that part of Soviet territory. It was also said that Japan is believed to be invading Vladivostok, 1,800 miles south of the easternmost tip of Siberia.

United Press, Tokyo, 25th - The Kokumin Shimbun today called for the withdrawal of the activities of Germany, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States from the Far East. The newspaper stated that since Japan is establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is willing for Germany and the Soviet Union to stop their behind-the-scenes activities in Vietnam and China, and for Britain and the United States to withdraw from China, Thailand, and the Dutch East Indies. The newspaper said that because Japan can no longer transport raw materials to Germany and Italy via the Siberian Railway, the strength of the Tripartite Alliance and the effectiveness of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact have been considerably weakened, and therefore some obligations under those two treaties cannot be fulfilled. Regarding this level, Japan "should make every effort to improve relations with the United States."

Editorial

### International Reaction After the Outbreak of the Soviet-German War

When the Soviet-German war was on the verge of breaking out, the relations among the major powers were once in a state of chaos. The world was wondering: Under the instigation of the Nazis, would the current European war be transformed into a crusade against communism and the Soviet Union? If that were the case, the distinction between good and evil, the division between justice and aggression, would be completely blurred. It would not only completely change the entire international situation, but even reverse human history by decades. Fortunately, this Nazi scheme did not sway other countries, and Hitler's decision showed unprecedented recklessness and impatience. After the failure of the joint anti-Soviet conspiracy, he alone took the great risk of launching a military adventure, which instead promoted the maturation of the opportunity for democratic countries and the Soviet Union to jointly resist aggression. After twists and turns, it finally all came to the same conclusion. Reviewing the international history of the past two years, one cannot help but feel delighted.

The Soviet-German war has been going on for four days now. There has been no major progress or retreat in military terms. The Nazis' blitzkrieg tactics do not seem to have worked quickly this time. The international reaction, except for one or two countries, has generally been clear. On the Axis side, apart from Italy, which is following suit and willingly acting as a Nazi appendage, the actual accomplices are only Romania, Hungary, and even Spain. Bulgaria maintains neutrality, and Finland, which was listed as a member of the anti-Soviet alliance in the German declaration, is reportedly still maintaining neutrality. If this is true, it would be a failure for the Germans, because they failed to use the emotions left by the Finnish-Soviet war to strengthen their anti-Soviet strength. It also shows that the Nazis rushed into battle this time, which is very different from their previous well-planned approach. On the side of the democratic countries, Churchill's speech two nights ago announcing possible aid to the Soviet Union, Welles's stern condemnation of Germany on the third day, and President Roosevelt's expression of his intention to start providing material aid to the Soviet Union, all show that the United States and the United Kingdom sympathize with the Soviet Union's resistance to Germany. Due to practical and urgent needs, there will naturally be further cooperation and even alliance to fight side by side. However, due to the differences in the political systems and styles of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the conflict of ideologies, even at this critical juncture of jointly fighting against the Nazis, they have not been able to completely eliminate their past prejudices. Therefore, when the British and American authorities expressed the above views on aid to the Soviet Union, they could not help but simultaneously offer reminders and criticisms on issues of thought and belief, and there were also some reservations about aid to the Soviet Union. This is indeed the only regret in the current optimistic situation. With the wisdom and intelligence of the current British and American authorities, it is believed that they will definitely not make any extraneous demands at this time. However, because there are many prejudices among the people, they have to explain cautiously to avoid unexpected obstacles or resentment within. In fact, the central issue at present is only the struggle between justice and aggression, and everything else is irrelevant. Ideological systems are only internal issues of a country, while the crime of aggression threatens the entire world and humanity. The Nazi system's being abhorred by the world cannot be compared with the opposition to the Soviet Union. The main reason why various countries are fighting side by side against Germany at this time is because of its wanton aggression and annexation of neighboring countries, which endangers international justice and human survival, and is by no means solely because of dissatisfaction with National Socialism. Ideological and belief issues have their own developmental trajectory, and crusades are often futile. At this time, equating communism with Nazism is tantamount to objectively letting go of the Nazi crime of aggression. This is also Hitler's previous intention to induce democratic countries to jointly oppose the Soviet Union. The previous League of Nations and some international conferences never excluded the Soviet Union because of different political systems. The revival of international anti-Soviet sentiment in the past year or two is largely due to the Soviet Union's rapprochement with Germany and its treatment of Finland and the three Baltic countries. However, the various territorial changes made by the Soviet Union in recent years, apart from Northern Bukovina, have not exceeded the territorial scope of the former Tsarist Russia. The current Nazi actions prove that the Soviet Union's previous deep-seated fear was not unfounded. Any country's unwillingness to see the Soviet Union interfere in its internal affairs is the same as the Soviet Union's unwillingness for other countries to interfere in its internal affairs. Churchill said, "All of this has now been dispelled in the face of the current developments." At this critical moment in the history of the world, we must no longer let past prejudices and resentments become hidden causes of future suspicions among the major powers.

Under this situation, the countries in the most delicate and difficult situation are only Turkey in the Near East and Japan in the Far East. Turkey has been a partner of the Soviet Union for many years, has mutual assistance obligations to the United Kingdom, and has recently concluded a friendship treaty with Germany. Therefore, when the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union are jointly fighting against Germany, even if it temporarily maintains neutrality, it must feel the difficulty of dealing with the environment. Once the war reaches a considerable stage, it can be asserted that its neutrality will be difficult to continue. As for Japan, it has always wavered between the United Kingdom and the United States and the Axis powers. Until recently, the Tripartite Pact is still valid, and its authorities have great illusions about friendship with the United States. Between the Soviet Union and Japan, there is both a neutrality pact and an anti-communist agreement. How to reconcile Article 3 and Article 5 of the Tripartite Pact with the neutrality pact after the outbreak of the Soviet-German war is a major issue. On the other hand, the war against China has no hope of ending, and the attempt to advance south is difficult to carry out. The war between the Soviet Union and Germany may also revive its old dream of advancing north. No matter what decision the Japanese authorities make in their deliberations, the current extremely complex international environment is a major challenge for Matsuoka's multilateral diplomacy. No matter what step is taken, it will inevitably encounter constraints and resistance in one aspect. This difficulty is not only unprecedented in Japanese history, but also unprecedented for any country. Even with great wisdom and courage, it is difficult to deal with it with ease. For today's Japanese authorities, it will only increase their bewilderment and distress.

British Foreign Secretary Explains British Attitude Toward the Soviet Union in the House of Commons

Reuters, London, 25th - British Foreign Secretary Eden, amid cheers in the House of Commons yesterday, clarified Britain's attitude toward the Soviet Union, saying that Prime Minister Churchill had announced to the world on Sunday the decision made by the British government due to Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union.

Germany Sees Treaties as Disguises

Today, I would like to present to you the diplomatic events before Germany attacked the Soviet Union and the developments after Germany attacked the Soviet Union. The House of Commons and the people of the country are willing to have a clear understanding of this event. We are focusing on one goal. What is this goal? It is Hitler's Germany. We might as well believe that Hitler is also focusing on one goal, and that goal is Britain. It is firmly believed that Britain is the main obstacle in its progress to world domination. Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union is not an end in itself, but a means. He hopes to use this attack to break the military strength of a huge country, so that he can turn to attack our country in the future without worrying about the east. We must also consider the German policy toward the Soviet Union set forth in the book "Mein Kampf." Although Hitler's diplomacy has recently changed suddenly, its essence remains the same. People should not forget for a moment Germany's unlimited ambition, which is the main theme of its desire for world domination. All treaties, agreements, and covenants are seen by Hitler as disguises for new aggressions. In today's difficult and dangerous diplomatic situation, it is useless to make a detailed and lengthy analysis of the rise and fall of British-Soviet relations. However, I would like to elaborate on one thing, which seems to be the basic truth for estimating British-Soviet relations.

No Conflict of Interests Between Britain and the Soviet Union

In 1935, we agreed with the Soviet government in Moscow on a document that stated that there was no conflict of interests between the two governments on any major issue of international policy. I have always believed that this statement is a frank description of the facts, and I believe that the mutual recognition of this statement by both parties can benefit the relations between the two countries. Although the relations between the two countries have changed frequently since 1935, this statement is still as relevant and to the point today as it was in 1935. The political systems of Britain and the Soviet Union are opposite, and the lifestyles of both sides are very different. However, this cannot obscure the reality of the political issues we are facing today. Germany has now launched a long-planned invasion of the Soviet Union. Two years ago, Germany and the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression pact. Since the signing of the pact, Germany has never accused the Soviet Union of violating the pact. Germany has not negotiated or initiated any discussions. Now, without any warning, it suddenly attacked the Soviet Union. The recent statement by the German Foreign Minister that "when the German army was gathering on the border of Bulgaria and Romania to prevent the British army from continuing to land in Greece, the Soviet Union, with the consent of the British, planned to assassinate Germany from behind, first by providing political assistance to the southern countries and secretly providing military assistance, and second by inducing Turkey to adopt a hostile attitude toward Bulgaria and Germany" is completely false. This is a statement by Hitler. I cannot help but point out that we would very much welcome the establishment of an agreement with the Soviet Union to maintain the unity of the people of the Balkan Peninsula before Germany wreaked havoc. Unfortunately, the opportunity for such an agreement never arose.

Britain Knew About Nazi Tricks Long Ago

I can now tell the House of Commons the reason why Britain sought to establish any agreement with the Soviet Union on this matter. At any stage of recent history, the progress of British-Soviet relations has been hindered. The reason for this is that the Soviet Union's attention to adhering to the Soviet-German pact has always determined that when studying the possibility of concluding negotiations or political agreements, we have always seen that the Soviet Union is not prepared to conduct negotiations, because it does not want to cause any obstacles to its relations with Germany. On our part, we do not want to establish any agreement with the Soviet Union except on the basis of mutual benefit and reciprocity. From the perspective of the Soviet-German pact, this kind of foundation does not exist. This shows that the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's statement is completely unfounded. In addition, there is one thing I must mention. The Prime Minister said yesterday that Britain had warned the Soviet authorities of the crisis. This warning was issued some days before the recent events occurred. We had already known from external intelligence that Hitler would never change his usual tricks and would attack the Soviet Union behind the smoke screen of the non-aggression pact. With the Prime Minister's consent, I conveyed the information we had obtained to the Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom and informed him of the danger the Soviet Union was about to face. At the request of the Soviet Ambassador, I also showed him the details of the information we had obtained. However, at that time, the Soviet government was still unwilling to express any opinions in order to avoid the suspicion that the Soviet Union was disloyal to the pact with Germany. This happened several weeks ago. I expected that it would break out beforehand, so I summoned Ambassador Cripps, who was stationed in the Soviet Union, back to the country to report on his work, because I felt that his experience and opinions were extremely valuable at this time.

The Results of British-Soviet Consultations Are Kept Secret

The House of Commons and the people of the country will greatly admire Cripps's work in extremely difficult circumstances. I have already mentioned the reasons why he failed to conclude any agreement with the Soviet Union. However, he has already informed the Soviet Union of the British government's basic desire to maintain relations between the two countries on a normal basis. When he returns to Moscow in the future, he will be able to guide the Soviet Union on the assistance that the British government is now officially announcing that it is willing to provide to the Soviet Union. Since the events of the past few days have occurred, the British and Soviet governments have been conducting talks. I am unable to disclose all the results of these talks at this time. However, I have now received a notice from the Soviet Ambassador that the Soviet government has accepted our proposal to send a military and economic mission to the Soviet Union and to coordinate efforts to eliminate the common enemy. The Soviet government believes that the period of military cooperation should be based on mutual benefit. The British government agrees with this view and accepts it. Germany's attack on the Soviet Union has repeatedly proved with this treacherous act that it has ambitions to expand its power. Hitler has proved to be a perfidious and self-serving villain. He talks about peace today and starts a war tomorrow. He utters mild and sweet words this winter and launches attacks with bombs and tanks next spring. His fickleness knows no bounds. The words of the Nazis can no longer deceive the world. All countries must now know that no matter what the nature of their government or where their country is located, the greatest danger to their security is the existence of the Nazi system. Even if there are other concerns, Nazism is the greatest danger. Britain may have fewer communists than other European countries. We have always disagreed with this kind of ideology. But this is not the point of contention. Now the Soviet Union has offended Germany. The Soviet army is now fighting for its own land. They are resisting a person who wants to dominate the world. This is also the only task of mankind. The more we see the recent aggression, the more determined we are to make redoubled efforts.

Extreme Sympathy for the Polish People

Napoleon once said, "I often march with an army of four to five hundred thousand men." Now, after Hitler's recent acts of aggression, we will march with the sympathy of billions of people. At this time, we express our great sympathy to our Polish comrades, whose land has now become a battlefield again, and whose people are now suffering innocently. Poland has a difficult history. The Polish people have won their freedom with their courage in extremely difficult times. They will regain their freedom in the future. This has always been our guarantee. Turkey has now announced its neutrality in the Soviet-German war. Since the signing of the Anglo-Turkish Mutual Assistance Treaty in October 1939, our relationship with Turkey has always been placed on a special basis. Turkey is our friend and our comrade. The Turkish government informed us of the details of its recent negotiations with Germany, so we have long known about the conclusion of the Turkish-German agreement. Although we would prefer that there be no such treaty, the preamble to this treaty contains a guarantee that the treaty obligations of both parties exist. The Turkish government has repeatedly declared to us that its most important treaty obligation is the Anglo-Turkish Treaty. The Turkish government, after concluding the treaty with Germany and in the past 24 hours, has repeatedly declared to the British Ambassador to Turkey that the Anglo-Turkish Treaty remains intact. At the same time, the Finnish Minister to the United Kingdom visited the Foreign Office and informed me of a letter from the Finnish government stating that Finland's attitude is purely defensive and will remain unchanged in the Soviet-German conflict, and that there will be no changes in diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Finland. The Finnish government hopes that Finland will not be drawn into the war. I told him that I would record this promise and that I firmly believe that the path that the Finnish government has announced that it has adopted is the only correct path for Finland to take.

British Parliament Debates Policy Toward the Soviet Union and Turkey

Reuters, London, 25th - The House of Lords debated British policy toward the Soviet Union yesterday. Dominion Affairs Secretary Cranborne made a brief statement similar to that made by Eden in the House of Commons, saying that Britain and the Soviet Union differ greatly on political and religious issues, but when they encounter a common violent enemy and become the target of its insatiable ambition, they have a common interest. It would be foolish to ignore this. Regarding the progress of the war, he had little to report. Both sides have issued communiques, but they are only a few words long. Liberal Party MP Lord Samuel said that it would be a huge mistake for Britain or the United States to implement their efforts because Germany is at war with the Soviet Union, because when the war with the Soviet Union ends, Germany may obtain supplies from the Soviet Union, and its strength will be stronger than when it started the war with the Soviet Union.

Reuters, London, 15th - During the debate in the House of Commons yesterday, everyone focused on the attitude that the British government should take toward the Soviet Union and Turkey, given that Turkey had recently signed a new agreement with Germany. First, the only Communist Party MP in the House of Commons, Gallacher, stood up and spoke, arguing that the government should cooperate with the Soviet Union in the great task ahead in the most complete and active way possible. The MP also replied to questions, saying that the Communist Party is determined to assist the country's war effort with all its strength, and that the Communist Party has not delayed the production of manufactured goods, and that if there are delays, the government and employers must be responsible. Then, former Secretary of War for the Liberal National Party, Bellisha, said that the recent developments are indeed gratifying, and that Germany's efforts to attack Britain will be temporarily relaxed. No matter what the outcome of the Soviet-German war, Germany's war materials will be greatly consumed. The best way to help the Soviet Union is to take the sea route, but unfortunately Greece, Crete, and the Aegean Islands are all occupied by Germany, and the road to the Soviet Union through the Dardanelles is greatly inconvenient. He also mentioned Turkey, saying that if we do not help Turkey now, Germany will use that country as a way to achieve its ambitions. Fortunately, the Syrian war is expected to end soon, which will be a way to support Turkey. Now, it is urgent to take action in the military field to reassure Turkey. Is Hitler taking a gamble by attacking the Soviet Union, or is he planning carefully? We must know. However, we have had a good rest because of this, and we ask the government to make full use of it. Then, Conservative Party MP Winterton said that the overall situation between the United Kingdom and the United States should be made clear. He expressed his admiration for the Turks and acknowledged that the difficulties they faced were very significant. He later mentioned that since the Turks had signed an agreement with the United Kingdom's greatest enemy, he should be asked how he could be friends with both countries at the same time when the United Kingdom and Germany were enemies. At this point, Prime Minister Churchill stood up and asked the MP to speak cautiously, saying that a country like Turkey is surrounded by great difficulties, and we should forgive it for failing to clarify its attitude. Then, Conservative Party MP Bouch, representing millions of Catholics who are loyal to the King of England, said that both communism and Nazism are abhorrent to us. If the government adheres to its guarantee not to revoke its previous views on communism, then Catholics are willing to support all the necessary plans implemented by the government. We are willing to stand behind the government and watch the goal, which is the complete destruction of Hitler and Nazi Germany. Next, Labour Party MP Bevan advocated bombing Germany with bombers as soon as possible. Conservative MP Strachey hoped that the attacks on the Soviet Union and the three Baltic countries would not be condoned. Liberal opposition MP Mandel hoped that the Foreign Secretary would use his diplomatic skills to get the Soviet Union and Poland to reconcile. Liberal National Party MP Granville said that Germany is now fighting on both the east and west fronts. Every bomb dropped on Germany's transportation, industry, and military targets today is worth ten bombs two weeks later.

### Lithuania Forced to Participate in Anti-Soviet War, Slovakia Also Assists Germany in the War

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 25th - German troops occupied Kaunas (the capital of Lithuania, also known as Kovno) yesterday afternoon. The large Soviet troops stationed in the city quickly fled beforehand. Pobeiris, the city defense commander before June 15, 1940, when the Soviet troops had not yet occupied the city, has returned to his original post. General Pancevicius, Chief of the General Staff of Lithuania, has been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Lithuanian Army.

United Press, Stockholm, 25th - According to Swedish newspapers, 60,000 Latvians have rebelled against the Soviet Union with weapons and ammunition. They have formed a formal army and destroyed bridges and important highways.

Haitong News Agency, Bratislava, 25th - Slovak Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tuka notified the German Embassy in Slovakia yesterday afternoon that Slovakia had entered a state of war with the Soviet Union, and issued the following declaration: "In order to maintain its close relationship with Greater Germany, the Slovak people have joined the war to defend European culture. A portion of the Slovak army has left the country and joined the German army in combat."

### Polish Border Plains: Soviet and German Forces Engage in Bloody Battle, Countless Tanks Deployed, Extensive Retaliatory Bombing by Both Sides

TASS, Moscow, 25th – The Soviet Information Bureau has just released the following announcement (henceforth, all war reports will be issued by the Soviet Information Bureau): "On the 20th, all day long, enemy forces continued their offensive in the areas of Shalai, Konos, Gonov, Kovis, Kobrin, Friede, and Mivolynsk, as well as Brody, encountering strong resistance from the Red Army. In the Zilai area, the enemy suffered heavy losses. In the Gonov, Volkovysk, and Brest-Pinsk areas, fierce battles are in progress as both sides contend for Gorutni, Kobrin, Vilno, and Konos. In the Brody area, tank units from both sides are engaged in fierce combat, with the enemy suffering significant damage. Our air force units are cooperating effectively, inflicting serious blows on enemy military targets and airfields, shooting down 34 enemy aircraft in aerial combat. Finnish naval forces sank an enemy submarine. Aircraft from the Maya territory bombed Sevastopol twice. In retaliation, the Soviet air force bombed Constanta and Sulina, setting Constanta on fire. German aircraft bombed Kyiv, Minsk, Libava, and Riga. In retaliation, Soviet aircraft bombed Danzig, Königsberg, Lublin, and Warsaw three times, causing great damage to military targets. The gasoline storage depot in Warsaw is on fire. On the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th, the Soviet side lost 374 aircraft, mostly destroyed at airfields. During the same period, 161 German aircraft were destroyed in aerial combat and 220 at airfields. In the Shalai area, our mechanized units counter-attacked, routed enemy tank units, and eliminated a motorized infantry regiment."

United Press, London, 25th – According to recent dispatches received by British official sources, German and Soviet forces are currently engaged in a terrifying bloody battle along a 500-mile front from Shalai to Brody, using countless troops, tanks, artillery, and aircraft. This area appears to be the main sector of the current 1,500-mile front, which was formed after reports of German mechanized units advancing deep into Lithuania and Latvia, seemingly poised to seize Riga. However, Soviet forces retreated and launched a major counter-offensive against the Nazi advance. In the south, German forces appear to be advancing into Ukraine (according to one report, German forces have penetrated as far as 120 miles), but the Soviet side claims that Yersainoti has not yet fallen.

United Press, Stamford, 23rd – Angara Radio reported yesterday that German and Romanian forces have occupied Kishinev, the capital of Bessarabia, located 40 miles east of the Prut River. German and Romanian forces also simultaneously occupied Polgarad, 25 miles northeast of Galati and Cernăuți on the Romanian border.

German and Soviet Strategic Maneuvering Deemed Evenly Matched

United Press, London, 25th – Judging from the current situation, the earlier speculation here that the Soviet forces might adopt a defensive posture in the south and an offensive posture in the north at the start of the German-Soviet war seems quite credible. According to this theory, Soviet forces might employ the traditional "entice the enemy deep" strategy in the south, drawing enemy forces through the indefensible wheat fields of Ukraine. Once the German lines of communication have been extended to approximately 1,500 miles, the Soviet forces might engage the German forces along the heavily fortified banks of the Don River. However, in the north, it is believed that Soviet forces might use their mechanized unit tactics to attempt to break through the Baltic states, traversing East Prussia to reach the German mainland. The right flank of the Soviet forces will inevitably be threatened by German forces within Finland, but according to news from the Swedish capital, the Soviet Union is hoping for assistance from the British navy to seize Murmansk and Arkhangelsk, enabling them to harass German forces from these locations. It is anticipated that German forces may also advance north from Lake Ladoga to Leningrad via Karelia and Idemus, but Soviet forces will certainly resist them along the shores of Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega. Simultaneously, reports are increasing that Germany is planning an offensive against the Caucasus via the Black Sea. According to information from Moscow, the Soviet Union bombed Constanta and other Romanian Black Sea ports, where a large number of German, Romanian, and Italian vessels of various types are gathered, along with German submarines arriving via the Danube. Military experts here say that Germany is planning to attack the flank of the Soviet Union along the northern Danube and land from Crimea, but the Black Sea is controlled by the Soviet fleet, so any transport must have sufficient protection. Germany currently lacks sufficient protection in the region unless Turkey permits warships to pass through the Dardanelles.

Haitong Press, Berlin, 25th – Authoritative sources here announced last night that, after a fierce offensive, German forces have now penetrated deep into Soviet lines, destroying 180 Soviet armored vehicles along the way.

Hitler Goes to the Front, Sets Up Headquarters in Poland

United Press, Stockholm, 25th – Swedish newspapers report that German Chancellor Hitler has departed from Germany for a location in Poland to establish headquarters. Hitler's train is a specially constructed armored train now heading east.

Havas Agency, Stockholm, 25th – Havas Agency special dispatch: The main battle between Germany and the Soviet Union is currently being conducted in three sectors. The first sector is within Lithuania, where German motorized units, after occupying the city of Vilnius, are advancing north toward the city of Kaunas. The second sector is within the former Polish-Soviet occupied territories, with the German offensive line extending from Grodno in the north to the edge of the Pinsk Marshes in the south. The German offensive objective appears to be to cut off the railway line between Warsaw and Minsk (capital of the Belarusian Soviet Republic). The third sector is south of the Pinsk Marshes, including the Volhynia region, where troops from both sides are fiercely battling. The ultimate German objective appears to be to capture the Shemesel Fort in Galicia (a famous battlefield in the last European war). Generally, the German forces will likely launch a major offensive in the area after the Romanian and Slovakian forces have made progress.

United Press, Berlin, 25th – The German offensive against the Soviet Union appears to have reached the level of a true blitzkrieg, as the German High Command has just announced from the German Führer's headquarters that the army, air force, and navy engaged in the offensive against the Soviet Union are in a favorable situation and can expect great achievements.

Soviet Union Adopts Nazi Tactics, Launches Full-Scale Offensive

United Press, Angara, 25th – Military sources here close to the Axis powers stated yesterday that the Soviet Red Army has reversed its previous strategy of defeating Napoleon's army through retreat tactics and will adopt the same tactics as Germany, launching a full-scale offensive. These sources stated that German forces are currently advancing on Kyiv in two routes, one from Lublin and the other from Dorua. Cernăuți, Lublin, and Kyiv, south of the Berripo steppe, are forming a horn-like formation. The German forces hope to encircle the 35 elite Soviet divisions concentrated there. Another German route, based in Warsaw, is advancing directly on Moscow from Grodno and Minsk. Both German routes are following the main Soviet railway lines, but German forces cannot use these railways for transportation because the Soviet railway gauge differs from the German gauge. These sources also stated that Romanian forces, with the assistance of German forces, are tasked with occupying Odessa. Finnish forces, with the assistance of German forces, will advance on Leningrad, but the fighting on this line will likely be delayed because Finland has not yet officially acknowledged participation in the war.

Battle Line Extends for Thousands of Miles, Red Army Resistance is Fierce

Reuters, London, 25th – Recent news received here regarding the German-Soviet war reports that new fighting and close combat are occurring along the vast border of the Soviet Union, but the report did not specify the locations of the fierce fighting. German sources invariably state that Soviet resistance is extremely fierce. This morning, Moscow newspapers reported that Soviet aircraft, departing from bases within Soviet territory, flew 440 miles to bomb targets in Germany, and Soviet fighters shot down several German fighters. Today, Moscow newspapers carried frontline news, mostly describing the heroic deeds of Soviet forces in repelling German forces. The German side issued several exaggerated reports, such as annihilating a Soviet border guard division that offered stubborn resistance. A German radio station revealed that German forces are now using flamethrowers to attack Soviet fortresses that are three miles deep. News from Finland reported that German forces are advancing along roads toward Riga, the capital of Latvia, having occupied the last city in Lithuania and reached a point several miles from the Latvian border. German aircraft have also been dispatched to bomb Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, where the Soviet Union has a naval base. Yesterday, the brief official reports from both sides stated that initial battles had been advantageous. According to the Moscow radio station, "The enemy's offensive has been repelled, congratulations on the initial military victory of the Red Army." The German High Command communiqué stated, "The military operations of the German army in the east are proceeding according to plan and are quite satisfactory." A dispatch from Turkey reported news from Varna, Bulgaria, that a naval battle occurred off the Bulgarian coast yesterday, with Soviet destroyers, cruisers, and submarines engaging German aircraft. However, this report has not been confirmed. It is now known that German forces have laid mines along the coasts of both countries, but it is believed that a narrow channel has been left unmined at the mouth of the Bosphorus Strait. Turkish sources acknowledge that German forces have encountered strong resistance on the border and that Soviet forces are not conducting a defensive war but are launching counter-offensives. The Soviet side reports major air battles along the entire front, with Soviet aircraft gaining the upper hand. News from Bucharest reported that a Romanian column has departed from Galati and advanced eight kilometers toward Terotini (south of Kishinev). However, Turkish and Soviet sources stated that Romanian forces have not participated in the fighting and are currently only serving as reserves. The Romanian side also claimed that Romanian forces have crossed the Prut River at Galati, Jesse, and Lipcani, with the northernmost auxiliary force advancing, and the remaining two routes advancing toward Odessa (150 miles from the current border). German sources in Turkey boasted that the war could be concluded within six months, with the occupation of Belarus, Ukraine, and the Caucasus.

### Major Personnel Changes Expected Among Red Army Generals to Strengthen Combat Effectiveness Against Germany, Vichy Reports Internal Disputes in the Soviet Union

Havas Agency, Switzerland, 24th – Since the Soviet-Finnish War in 1939, the Soviet Union has reorganized its supreme command several times. The position of Chief of the General Staff has been changed several times since Shaboshnikov's resignation in June 1940. The current Chief of Staff, Zhukov, is already the fourth person. Regarding the Soviet Union's operational theory, the Red Army High Command has previously sparked major debates, resulting in the removal of generals who advocated defensive warfare on home soil. Therefore, the current generals all advocate fighting in enemy territory. However, considering the current military situation, this theory has proven to be counterproductive. To remedy this, the Soviet High Command will inevitably need to readjust personnel again. It is expected that there will be major personnel changes among Red Army generals in the near future.

United Press, Vichy, 25th – Diplomatic circles here widely rumored yesterday that a serious split has occurred among Stalin's subordinates in the Kremlin. This news was also carried in the "Geneva Daily News." It is said that this split was caused by the attitude adopted by the Soviet Union towards Germany and began with the outbreak of the Soviet-German war. It is said that two factions are attacking each other, one being the military personnel under Marshal Timoshenko, Minister of Defense, supported by Mikoyan, Minister of Foreign Trade of the Soviet Union, Kaganovich, Deputy Chairman of the People's Committee, and Kalinin, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. This faction calls itself the "Military Patriotic Group." The second faction is called the "Brest-Litovsk Anti-War Group," supported by Foreign Minister Molotov and Malenkov, Secretary General of the Communist Party Central Committee. This faction advocates conducting negotiations through diplomatic means to explore Germany's true intentions. Timoshenko advocates using one Soviet division to counter each German division. If Germany launches a full-scale attack, the Soviet Union will also gather a large army to resist. The "Geneva Daily News" stated that when the Supreme Military Council met on May 12, these two factions held different views and clashed. Stalin, Timoshenko, and other political officials were also present at the time. Stalin then adopted a compromise solution, instructing the military to take all necessary precautions while supporting Molotov's proposal to use diplomatic channels to obtain more complete information on Germany's intentions. It is said that since then, disputes have occurred frequently in diplomatic circles, with Marshal Timoshenko and Malenkov being the most vocal. Recently, Marshal Timoshenko appointed twelve military officials as governors, dividing them among major cities, including Kyiv, Leningrad, and Moscow. The conflict between the two factions then became increasingly intense. Malenkov opposed this appointment. According to diplomatic circles, the dispute had not been resolved by the time the Soviet-German war broke out and general mobilization was declared.

### Moscow Tests Air Raid Preparedness, Defense Against German Paratroopers in Various Locations

During the alarm, Moscow residents rushed to air raid shelters, air raid stations provided services, and trucks distributed fire-fighting supplies. At this time of year, the darkness hours in Moscow are quite short. When the "enemy planes" flew over Moscow, it was already dawn. When the artillery fired, the sky was filled with red light and black smoke. Observers gazed intently to observe the effect.

TASS, Moscow, 25th – German paratroopers, in groups of five or ten, disguised as Soviet militiamen, are landing in Soviet territory to sabotage transportation. The Soviet rear has organized paratrooper elimination teams. The People's Commissariat is responsible for command.

Reuters, London, 25th – Regarding the Nazi-organized riot that occurred outside the British Embassy in Madrid yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Eden is scheduled to meet with the Spanish Ambassador to Britain today.

(3) The people must not support communist propaganda in action or sentiment.

The repercussions of the war, especially in the economic sphere, are gradually striking us severely.

### Soviet and Germany Will Exchange Diplomatic Personnel, German Interests in the Soviet Union Entrusted to Bulgaria for Management

### U.S. Government to Find Ways to Maintain World Shipping Lanes; Requisitioning of President Liners for Conversion into Troop Transports Shows Resolve to Implement War Preparedness Plan

Washington News, June 9 - With the requisitioning of the American President Lines' President Coolidge (22,000 tons) and President Cleveland (12,500 tons) by the U.S. Maritime Commission, American trade with the Far East can be said to have come to a halt. Within a week, the Maritime Commission has requisitioned President Lines ships, including President Pierce, President Taft, President Adams, President Jackson, and President Hayes. Now, President Coolidge and President Cleveland are being requisitioned as well. Whether smaller ships will be used to sail the Pacific in the future has not yet been announced. Historically, trans-Pacific mail, including printed matter, has been carried by President Lines ships. If no additional ships are added to the trans-Pacific service, there will be difficulties with postal transport. It is reported that the President Lines' round-the-world mail ship schedule will continue as normal. The ships on this route are President Harrison, President Monroe, President Garfield, President Grant, President Buchanan, and President Polk. Since President Roosevelt implemented unlimited emergency powers, the requisitioning of twenty merchant ships demonstrates the U.S. government's determination to implement its war preparedness plan. The 27,000-ton passenger liner America, long known as the flagship of the American merchant fleet, was requisitioned by the Navy last month. Requisitioned merchant ships will be assigned to auxiliary fleet duties. It is rumored that within a few weeks, more ships sailing the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico will be requisitioned. The Maritime Commission also announced that American merchant ships will soon take over all British routes from the U.S. and Canada to Australia and New Zealand, as Britain is in the process of moving all its shipping operations out of the war zone. This move will allow Britain to redeploy at least twelve ships for war-related tasks. President Coolidge can accommodate 800 passengers and can be converted into a troop transport capable of carrying 2,500 soldiers. The requisitioning of President Taft will eliminate the direct route between San Francisco and Honolulu with Hong Kong. President Jackson, one of the seven newest and fastest freighters on the round-the-world route, was ordered requisitioned by the government, and is scheduled to make its first voyage this week. There is widespread speculation here that the U.S. government will find ways to maintain the President Lines' world shipping routes, or will redeploy other ships to prevent the interruption of American round-the-world service.

### Chongqing Newspaper Comments on German-Soviet War

Havas Agency, Chongqing, 25th - The military newspaper "Saodang Bao" recently published an authoritative inspection on the German-Soviet war, stating that the Soviet Union is an ally of China, and since Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people have sympathized with the Soviet Union's invasion. It is believed that Japan's course of action in the Soviet-German war will have the most significant impact. Japan has three goals: (1) to destroy China, (2) to attack the United States, and (3) to conquer the Soviet Union. Four years of heroic resistance by China have proven that Japan's dream of destroying China is difficult to achieve, and there are many obstacles to attacking the United States. However, Japan has a pact with Germany and Italy, and in order to express its commitment to its obligations under the alliance with Germany, it must choose one of two options: advance south or advance north. The easiest and most likely option is for the Kwantung Army to take risks against the Soviet Union, seize the Soviet Maritime Province, occupy Vladivostok and Sakhalin Island, and include the northern fishing grounds. Japan's attack on the Soviet Union is imminent. If this period passes, due to climate changes, it must be delayed for another six months. In these six months, there will be many international changes, and Japan cannot wait long. Another theory is that Japan is working hard to resolve the China Incident, and after extorting the Soviet Union, it will transfer troops stationed in Korea and northern Manchuria to invade China with all its might. However, this is impossible. Their final struggle is only to further squeeze the economic resources in the occupied areas. In short, the more the international environment changes, the more favorable it is for our Chinese war.

### Soviet Nationals in This City Raise Funds and Contribute Supplies to Their Motherland; Plan to Purchase Several Ambulances to Donate to the Army; This Action is Purely a Patriotic Act by Soviet Nationals

After learning of Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union on the 22nd, Soviet nationals in this city were motivated by patriotic zeal. The Overseas Association immediately convened an emergency meeting that afternoon and decided to place Soviet nationals in Shanghai under a state of mobilization, awaiting government orders and party assignments to serve their motherland. It is learned that there were further actions yesterday, with the Overseas Association and the Russian-language newspaper launching a campaign to organize a war fund to raise funds and donate supplies to their motherland. Details are as follows:

Collecting Donations to Purchase Ambulances

The Soviet Overseas Association, lacking a receiving agency for donating materials to the motherland, jointly launched a campaign with the Russian-language newspaper to organize a war fund. Furthermore, because the Soviet government does not accept cash donations, the association decided to donate materials to the motherland and plans to use the donations received to purchase several ambulances to donate to the Red Army. Donations will be accepted by the Overseas Association and the Russian-language newspaper, located at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Rue de la Consulat. Donations will be received and managed by the Moscow Narodny Bank at 9 Avenue Edward VII. According to those in charge, the most needed items are clothes and cigarettes, but other items are also very welcome. It was also stated that this action is not directed by the Soviet government, but is purely motivated by the patriotic zeal of Soviet nationals.

Anti-German Slogans Discovered in Western Shanghai

The English-language North China Daily News reports that anti-German slogans and the Soviet hammer and sickle emblem, measuring more than two feet, were discovered today (25th) on the gray walls of the German School at the intersection of Great Western Road and Hart Road, all painted in deep red. It is believed that they were painted at night or this morning. The German School is the main gathering place for Nazi groups in this city. It is heard that after Germany declared war on the Soviet Union, several windows of the school were smashed.

Italian Nationals Also Extremely Tense

According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the Italian Consulate General on Chengdu Road in this city has been in a state of tension since receiving the telegram that their homeland had staked its national fortune and also declared war on the Soviet Union. The Italian Consul General and all staff are working from morning to night. The official residence of the Italian Consul General at 60 Great Western Road is bustling with activity, with many Italian nationals visiting. The president of the Italian Overseas Association, [unclear name], convened an emergency meeting of the executive committee at the Overseas Club at 10 Great Western Road to discuss the policy that Italian nationals in Shanghai should adopt in response to this new situation. After careful discussion, it was decided to trust the motherland and pray for the early completion of the motherland's overseas development.

### Able-Bodied Refugees Should Become Self-Reliant Quickly

The refugee provisions at the Cilian General Association's Ciyuan Shelter are allocated by the Relief Association. Last autumn, the association, noting that donations had become scarce, convened a meeting of various charities and resolved that, with the exception of the elderly, disabled, orphaned, widowed, and children, able-bodied refugees and refugees with productive capacity should be provided with allowances or relocated to the Dunxin Road Resettlement Center for adjustment. The Ciyuan Shelter still has more than 400 able-bodied men who have been sheltered for four years. Many of them have some income and should have left the shelter long ago. After the Cilian General Association passed the resolution last year, it ordered these able-bodied men to receive their fees and leave the shelter, while their family members, women, and children would remain in the shelter. After repeated persuasion, these able-bodied men repeatedly delayed their departure. Recently, the Relief Association's donations have dwindled, and every refugee who should not be sheltered means one less refugee who can be sheltered. The provisions for these able-bodied men were stopped. The Cilian General Association ordered the Ciyuan Shelter yesterday to earnestly promote this and had the police maintain order. Those who wish to leave the shelter will be given resettlement fees, while those who do not will be relocated to the Resettlement Center. Their family members will remain sheltered by the Ciyuan Shelter.

### Coal Briquettes Prices Fall

Since raising the price of coal briquettes to 316 yuan per ton, the city's major mechanized coal briquette factories have now reached the summer season, and residents' consumption has been greatly reduced, so sales have also declined sharply. It is found that the city's mechanized coal briquette factories produce about 1,200 tons of coal briquettes per day, which has now been reduced to 800 tons. The supply of coal briquettes in the market exceeds demand, and the unofficial price has fallen from 316 yuan per ton to 295 yuan per ton. The retail price has also fallen from 17 yuan per picul to 16 yuan per picul, which proves that the coal briquette factories' price increase was unreasonable, and the source of coal is still continuous. In addition to the British merchant Xiangtai Wheel joining the northern Jiangsu route to transport back and forth, yesterday the Panama merchant ship Capeira arrived in Shanghai from Ke Peide Port with 2,000 tons of coal. It is expected that during this slow season, the price of coal briquettes will continue to fall.

### Maritime Trade Between Shanghai and Vladivostok Has Been Restricted; Hongyun Shipping Agency Has Suspended Transport Services

Soviet ships have restricted maritime trade between Shanghai and Vladivostok, and the Hongyun Shipping Agency, which manages Soviet shipping in this city, has suspended transport services between these two ports. However, it is believed that postal services via Siberia will not be completely suspended. Mail to Germany and the occupied areas of Europe may be suspended, but mail to other parts of Europe may be able to pass through Siberia. The Shanghai Post Office is currently awaiting a response from the Soviet Post Office regarding this matter.

Soviet Ships to Manila Still Continuing

It is heard that the twenty ships sailing between Manila and Vladivostok are still sailing, but the future actions of the three Soviet ships currently docked in Shanghai are still undecided. Many mails to Germany, Italy, Finland, and Romania have now been rerouted via the Pacific, and will continue to be shipped out via this route in the future. The most recent batch of Shanghai mail to Europe, transported via Europe, totaled 124 mailbags, which were sent out last Saturday. Post office officials doubt whether this batch of mail will be able to reach its destination.

Mail to Europe Still Received as Usual

However, the post office is still accepting mail (except for parcels) transported to the Soviet Union via Nanjing and Tianjin. The original Suez Canal route to Europe has been suspended due to the war in the Mediterranean. If the Siberian postal route is also cut off, only the Pacific postal route will remain. If conflicts arise in the Pacific region, this route may also be abandoned.

Shanghai-Europe Telecommunications Congested

After the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, telecommunications between Shanghai and Europe are still unimpeded. Yesterday, according to inquiries from the city's Dadao and Beida East telegraph stations, telegrams to and from Shanghai and Berlin and Moscow are extremely congested. Reception and dispatch are inevitably slightly delayed. It is claimed that, regardless of sudden changes in the war, there should be no disruption of Shanghai-Europe telecommunications.

Shanghai Water Scene

In this city, at about 5 a.m. yesterday, the air pressure dropped, and there was a light drizzle. By 7 a.m., the rain intensified and did not stop all day, and with the help of the southwest wind, it became heavier and heavier. The wind and rain, together with the rising tide, rushed in. The low-lying roads were unable to drain the water and were flooded, with shallow areas reaching the shins and deep areas resembling swamps. It is said that yesterday's heavy rain was caused by the monsoon season, and it did not stop all day, with the most severe rain occurring at 7 a.m. and 3 p.m., for a total rainfall of 70.9 millimeters. The left picture (above) shows streetcars plowing through the waves, and (below) shows cars moving slowly through the flood, like boats on land. (Photos by Kang Zuyi)

### Two Thousand Night Soil Boats on Strike: The Whole Story; Racketeering by Outsiders and Price Hikes by Contractors

The Yangjing Creek, Old Zhaobang Bridge Creek South, North, Xijin Guild Hall, Shanxi Road Bridge, Jiangyuan Lane, Da Tong Road, Chi Bang Bridge, You Daijiao, Xiao Shabo, and other ten night soil piers in the Public Concession, with a total of more than two thousand night soil boats, have recently gone on strike due to dissatisfaction with racketeering by outsiders targeting the boatmen.

Extortion by Outsiders

Each boat was asked to pay five dollars, but when they refused, boatmen were beaten. At the same time, night soil cart coolies often mixed black water from the river into the night soil, reducing its quality, and selling half carts as full ones. Moreover, the contracting company wanted to increase the price, causing unbearable exploitation. Therefore, a strike has occurred, which has lasted for five days. Fortunately, all the piers have large sewer facilities, so the waste can

Still be Discharged Normally

Otherwise, a "yellow terror" would become even more severe. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Public Works Department's Political Department specially summoned representatives of the boatmen for talks to mediate. The representatives who attended included Qiu A Jin, Huang Xue Ru, Zhang Zhi Shu, Gu Cheng Feng, Liu Jin Cheng, Xiao A Er, and Cui Qi Sheng, totaling seven people. The authorities' representatives

Earnestly Persuaded

them to prioritize local order and promised to find ways to mediate all opinions immediately. The boatmen then put forward the following demands: (1) Release the four boatmen who were arrested: Zhu Zhao Jun, Huang Xue Hu, Ju Deng Fu, and Zhu A Mao. (2) The Da Li Company contracts the night soil of the Public Concession at a package price of 15,000 yuan per month, with 3,000 carts of night soil per day. Calculating each cart at 1.5 yuan, its profit

Is Already Astonishing

Now they want to raise the price again, which should be stopped immediately, setting 1.5 yuan as the maximum price. (3) Do not mix black water, and do not calculate half carts as full carts. The Political Department representatives promised to conduct an immediate investigation and then mediate to avoid affecting overall public health.

### Torrential Rain Fell Yesterday; Streets Flooded into Ditches; Ceaseless All Day and Heavier at Night; Low-Lying Areas Turned into Waterlogged Kingdom

The entire city of Shanghai was submerged in heavy rain all day yesterday, and the streets were flooded, greatly disrupting traffic. The situation is described as follows:

Rainfall

According to the Datong News Agency's inquiry to the Xujiahui Observatory, yesterday's heavy rain was a natural result of the plum rain season climate. The heaviest rainfall occurred in the early morning at 5:00 AM and in the afternoon. The rain continued ceaselessly throughout the day. The total rainfall from 5:00 AM to 5:00 PM yesterday, within twelve hours, amounted to 70.9 centimeters, the largest rainfall this year. After 8:00 PM, the rain became even heavier, and the streets near the Bund were flooded.

Weather

According to the Observatory's records, rainfall yesterday occurred only in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the surrounding areas of Shanghai. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River, on the other hand, had clear and refreshing weather, and the weather in North China was even better. Therefore, according to observations, Shanghai's weather today may stop raining, but it is difficult to avoid turning overcast. However, if the weather in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River deteriorates, this port will still be disturbed by wind and rain.

Flooding

Due to the heavy rain all day yesterday, all the streets were flooded into ditches. According to Datong News Agency reporters who braved the rain to inspect, areas such as Zhejiang Road, Nanjing Road, Guangxi Road, Guizhou Road, Avenue Albert, Gansu Road, Avenue Foch, Avenue Joffre, Rue Massenet, Avenue du Roi Albert, Rue de la Sœur, and Zhabei Sixteen Pups were all flooded above the ankles due to the water not being able to drain away in time. Driving cars was extremely difficult because the fuel tanks could be immersed in water.

### Li Junying's Coffin Sealed Yesterday; Mourners Filled the Room, Tears Streaming Down Their Faces

After the manager of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, Li Junying, was murdered, a grand coffin sealing ceremony was held at the Wan Guo Funeral Home yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Besides sending condolences and wreaths, dignitaries of the Party and the nation also sent telegrams of condolence. Many people from the Shanghai press and Li's friends sent condolences, wreaths, and elegiac couplets. After being made up, the deceased wore a white suit and a red tie, with a lifelike appearance, causing all who saw him to show respect. During the coffin sealing ceremony, more than three hundred guests paid their respects, and tears streamed down their faces. The grief of the family was indescribable. The bitter wind and rain added to the sorrow. Yu Zhizhai hosted the farewell ceremony, and amid the mournful music, Li bid farewell to the world forever. The details are recorded as follows:

Plain Banners and Fresh Flowers

Around the mourning hall, there were banners inscribed by Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, "His Noble Spirit Will Live Forever"; Chiang Kai-shek, "Righteousness Between Heaven and Earth"; Kong Xiangxi, "Eternal Model"; Wu Tiecheng, "Eternal Loyalty"; Zhu Jiahua, "A Thousand Autumns of Integrity"; Wang Shijie, Pan Gongzhan, Dong Xian Guang, "Model Journalist"; Jiang Bocheng, Wu Kaixian, "His Spirit Will Not Die"; Yu Hongjun, "Though Dead, Still Alive"; Xiao Tongzi, Chen Bosheng, "Uprightness in the Press"; Du Yuesheng, "Fragrant Reputation for Generations"; as well as wreaths and elegiac couplets sent by Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Sun Ke, Dai Jitao, the presidents of various academies, Minister of Education Chen Lifu, Special Commissioner to Shanghai Yu Zheng, and colleagues from the press, too numerous to count.

Telegrams of Condolence from All Sides

The Li Junying Funeral Committee received telegrams of condolence from Generals Chen Cheng and Zhang Zhizhong yesterday, which read: "To the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury and the family of Mr. Li Junying, upon hearing the tragic news of Mr. Li's sudden murder, we are deeply saddened. Your newspaper, as an American enterprise, has consistently taken the stance of friendly nations and made righteous appeals, which are greatly trusted by Chinese and foreign people. This has aroused jealousy. Mr. Li did not only sacrifice his life for his duty but also for justice. Although the martyr is dead, his spirit lives on. We hereby offer a condolence gift of one thousand yuan to express our condolences and hope that the family of Mr. Li will turn their grief into strength, continue his legacy, and console his spirit. Respectfully, Chen Cheng and Zhang Zhizhong." Zhu Jiahua, Minister of the Central Organization Department, also sent a telegram yesterday, which read: "To the gentlemen of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury and the family of Mr. Li Junying, upon hearing the tragic news that Mr. Li Junying unfortunately followed in the footsteps of Mr. Zhang Sixu and was murdered, Mr. Li Junying sacrificed himself to fulfill his duty, showing unwavering perseverance, which is admirable. We hereby send a telegram of condolence and one thousand yuan to be forwarded to Mr. Li Junying's family to help with the funeral and console his spirit. Zhu Jiahua."

### Daily Necessities Repeatedly Traded for Profit

Recently, due to the expansion of the war in Europe, speculators have once again become restless, using the excuse that the source of foreign goods will be interrupted to not only hoard goods and seek monopoly profits but also raise prices, thereby gaining illegal profits. As a result, the prices of various daily necessities, such as soap, matches, cigarettes, kerosene, and candles, have been rising sharply in recent days. The prices of these items have been raised to the highest peak, and retail prices in various stores have also been raised decisively, which has a significant impact on the livelihood of ordinary people. According to a certain person in the industry yesterday, the frequent price increases of daily necessities are completely unreasonable, and he is also very surprised by this. He continued, "How do changes in the international situation and the expansion of the war in Europe relate to the prices of daily necessities?" According to his reliable information, the raw material reserves of various daily necessities manufacturing plants in this city are still very abundant to meet daily needs. Therefore, there is no shortage. Regarding the manufacturing costs, since the raw materials for manufacturing have already been procured, there is no need to raise prices, and everything is the same as before. Moreover, the various daily necessities manufacturing plants have not increased the selling prices of their products, and the frequent rise in market prices is due to speculators repeatedly buying and selling or selling short. He also suggested, "I hope that the authorities responsible for suppressing and stabilizing prices will not underestimate the soaring prices of daily necessities. The high rise in market prices is completely unreasonable and has a significant impact on the livelihood of the middle and lower classes."

### Bank of China Branch Mergers Due to Reduced Business Scope, Three Branches to be Merged into Other Branches

According to reliable sources yesterday, three of the seven branches of the Bank of China in the two concessions of this city will be closed from July 1. The bank's management denied this, saying that the matter had been carefully considered. It is rumored that the branches to be closed from July 1 are those on Xinzha Road, Avenue Petain, and the branch that moved from the South City to Avenue Magy. Their staff and accounts will be merged into the remaining four branches. The business of the Xinzha Road branch will be taken over by the Hankou Road branch, and the remaining two branches will be merged into the Avenue Joffre branch. According to a senior official of the Bank of China, the three branches are planning to close from July 1 due to the reduction in their business scope in recent months.

### Japan Should Know What to Choose: Comments from English-Language Finance and Commerce Newspaper

Yesterday's English-Language Finance and Commerce Weekly commented on "The German-Soviet War and its Impact on the Far East," stating that the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, followed by Churchill's sharp statement offering the Soviet Union all possible assistance, has fundamentally changed the international situation and made the possibility of the war spreading to the Far East less likely than it was a few weeks ago. Before the Soviet Union was drawn into the European vortex and when the Siberian Railway was open, Germany could aid Japan with essential goods, and Japan greedily hoped to seize the resources of foreign countries in the South Seas in one fell swoop. Now, the Siberian Railway has stopped transporting goods for Germany, leaving Japan isolated and helpless.

Loyalty to Both Sides is Impossible

The credibility of Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union has caused more consternation in Japanese public opinion than anywhere else in the world. Japanese newspapers believe that this new development was completely unexpected. The key question is whether Britain will negotiate peace with Germany and unite against communism or continue to oppose Germany and align with the Soviet Union. Communism has frightened Japan for years, but today, it is hard to believe that this fear would constitute an anti-communist front. British Prime Minister Churchill's guarantee of aid to the Soviet Union is a pertinent and clear answer. Now is the time for Japan to decide which country to choose. Although Japan has signed treaties with Germany and the Soviet Union, it is inevitable that it cannot be loyal to both sides in word and spirit.

Democratic Countries Will Ultimately Prevail

In the German-Soviet war, Germany is pouring its national military power into one desperate gamble. Regardless of the short-term results of bombing and fighting, Germany will never be able to occupy the entire Soviet Union and force it to surrender, just as Japan cannot occupy such a large China and force it to submit. Even if the outcome of the war is not favorable to democratic countries, the United States will be able to catch its breath and replenish its resources before launching one final battle. Germany's blitzkrieg victories are only due to its mechanized troops and the superiority of its air force. If this advantage is offset by the vast industrial strength of the United Kingdom and the United States, the result will be that "freedom" must prevail, and Nazi leaders or "others not judged by their people" will likely be arrested and brought before the Allied Court of Justice to be tried for their crimes against humanity.

China Incident: A Dilemma

Now Japan is wavering and undecided, because China is like a large stone hanging around its neck. It cannot move forward, nor is it possible to retreat to its original position without damaging its national strength. At the same time, Japan has realized that its policies in recent years have been foolish, and the conference currently being held in Tokyo is only regarded as inevitably doomed to failure. Some factions in Japan are eager to resolve the China Incident and are willing to make some concessions as a test. The extent of the concessions currently under negotiation has been determined. However, most people believe that this is not enough to actually change the broad situation, and the opportunity to achieve a real solution in this area has already passed.

Japan Should Abolish the Tripartite Pact

Japan is one of the signatory countries of the Tripartite Pact, but this has no value for Japan, and the trend of the world situation will render it completely valueless. The abolition of the Tripartite Pact is now ripe, and this is what all countries are waiting for. At the same time, Japan should seek peace with China and achieve a fair and reasonable solution to the war, and Japan's relations with the United States can also be improved. Japan has no other way to go. The world has quickly divided into two major camps, pro-German and anti-German (Translator's note: This article represents the views of some British and American industrial and commercial circles, hoping that Japan will abolish the Tripartite Pact and at the same time achieve a solution to the Sino-Japanese problem. However, in any case, Sino-Japanese peace can only be established on the major premise of not sacrificing China; otherwise, collusion in the middle is tantamount to destruction. Better to die as a jade than to live as a tile. Readers should pay attention.)

### Public Buses to Raise Fares Again; Rumor Has It That the Bureau Has Approved; Official Announcement May be Issued Today

The Public Works Department held a routine meeting at 4:30 PM yesterday (the 25th), at which it is believed that decisions were made regarding the calls from the city's cinemas against further electricity reductions and the request from the British-owned Public Bus Company to increase fares again. Official announcements regarding these two issues have not yet been received from the bureau, but it is expected that they will be released today. It is only known that the bureau's Public Utilities Committee has submitted a suggestion to the board of directors regarding the bus fare increase, and it is rumored that the bus company requested permission from the bureau to double the fares, and the bureau is expected to allow them to increase the fare by 15%.

Cinemas Oppose Electricity Reduction

At the same time, the various cinemas and film distributors have sent letters to the Public Works Department opposing the further reduction in electricity, and they are now eagerly awaiting the results. It is known that the Public Works Department, when classifying electricity users last month, classified cinemas as "luxury class," and their electricity supply has been reduced by a quarter, and the electricity company believes that it is possible to continue to reduce it by 15% if necessary.

### Hu Changying's Injuries Still Critical; Japanese Continue to Search

The other day, at the entrance of Lai'an Lane, Xinmin Road, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, Hu Changying (55 years old), a Haining native who used to lead crowds in the Caobao area claiming to be a captain, was shot at and seriously wounded by someone, suffering a bullet wound. He was sent to Fumin Hospital for treatment. It is learned that Hu's injuries are still critical. At the same time, the Japanese dispatched a large number of military police to search the Baoshan Road area yesterday morning. It is rumored that several suspects were detained afterwards.

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that after the shooting of a Mr. Hu near the North Railway Station yesterday (the 24th), the Japanese naval authorities have arrested several Chinese suspected of committing the crime and are still investigating. It is rumored that the actual murderer has not yet been captured, so the Japanese are continuing their search. However, officials say that the murderer may have found a way to escape, so the chances of capturing the murderer are slim.

### YWCA Family Women's Association Activities

The Shanghai YWCA held a Family Women's Association at its Moore Road location from 4:00 PM on the 24th, and welcomed new members. The program for the day included piano solos, six-string guitar solos, plays, and children's performances, which were very interesting. As summer is approaching, various external ailments such as heat boils, eczema, ringworm, scabies, and insect bites are prone to occur, so the association specially requested several hundred boxes of the famous doctor Ding Ganren's proven "Ding's Ointment" from Hua Yi Pharmaceutical Factory, as well as the famous product "Bao Qing Chun" from Xin Ya Pharmaceutical Factory, and distributed them to the members. The association also has cooking classes, handicraft classes, English conversation classes, six-string guitar classes, and family religious groups. The 17th collective wedding organized by the Guizhou Road Hu She is scheduled to be held on June 29. As the location of the society is centrally located, the hall is magnificent, the layout is solemn, and the cost is economical (the participation fee is only 12 yuan per couple), participants are very enthusiastic. It is heard that there are still places available, and those who wish to participate should contact the office of the society as soon as possible.

### Yarn, Flower and Cotton Yarn Want to Break the 1600 Yuan Barrier; According to Our Newspaper's Investigation, Outlets to Hong Kong and Macau are Not Weak; Coupled with a Lack of Warehouse Receipts in the Market, Prices Surge

The yarn market first weakened and then rose, and the momentum is strong. This is because short sellers have been pressing down for the past two days, coupled with floating long positions being liquidated, causing the market to tend downwards. Unexpectedly, during this period, the quantity of cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong, as reported in our newspaper, actually exceeded 10,000 bales, and the Cantonese merchants still had intentions to acquire it. Therefore, there were still 300 bales of Shuangma factory orders traded, taking spot goods from the factory. The market situation today was that most people's minds were directed downwards at the opening, so many short positions were closed. Short sellers were not willing to pay the premium. Until near noon, because of the lack of warehouse receipts, short sellers were unable to borrow them, and the premium rose to 1.25 yuan. Still, some were difficult to close, so they had to grab long positions in the market. As a result, the market rose directly from 1540 yuan to 50 yuan. The high price for 20-count Shuangma was 1550 yuan, and the low price was 1530 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was 1548-49 yuan, and then, with a large amount of buying from securities merchants, short positions turned into long positions, rising directly to 1569 yuan. The final price was 1572 yuan, breaking through the high price of 1563 yuan, and there may be hope of seeing 1600 yuan. Mach opened, and because people were unanimously bearish, there were more sellers than buyers in the market. The provincial market price was 1530 yuan, but a certain foreign large account limited the entry price to 35 yuan. Once this price opened, the momentum turned stable, rising to 1540 yuan. However, short sellers came to pressure it again, so there was a struggle at 1534-35 yuan for one or two hours. Afterwards, Cantonese merchants still came to take warehouse receipts, and the market situation slightly improved. After 12:00, short sellers actively covered positions due to the lack of warehouse receipts, and it rose directly to 1550 yuan.

### Eager to Acquire Spot Goods, Not Sincere About Forward Contracts

The spot cotton situation is extremely firm. Due to the tense international situation, holders, seeing the yarn price jumping, did not even bother to provide samples or negotiate prices, which shows how high their expectations are. Only two or three hundred pieces were traded, resulting in an invisible standstill.

Trangong Flower 35, No. 100 pieces, warehouse delivery; Fire Machine grass package, No. 197.5, No. 200 bales, warehouse delivery; New York's cotton market fell due to foreign merchants selling and short sellers adding to their positions. The closing price yesterday was 15 to 22 pounds lower than the previous day, depending on the grade.

The Indian cotton market also fell due to the impact of the international war and profit-taking by various parties. The closing price yesterday fell by 45 rupees.

It is also predicted that the market situation at the opening today will continue to be slightly bearish, with a decrease of more than three rupees.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was slightly subdued due to the downward trend of American and Indian cotton. Foreign merchants and yarn factories were still eager to buy yesterday, and the total number of Brazilian cotton traded was no less than 1,000 bales. As for acquiring spot goods of Flower grades, it was quite active, but there seemed to be no sincerity in ordering forward contracts for American and Indian cotton.

### Securities and Public Bonds Market Outlook: Renewed Uptrend Seen

The gray market for public bonds saw a slight dip of five to six jiao yesterday, but quickly recovered to par. In the afternoon, an uptrend emerged, with the bullish forces proving formidable. On one side, some floating profits were taken; on the other, new buyers, such as Yongchang, suddenly absorbed a large quantity. Long-term bulls also increased their positions, gradually restricting the release of floating profits. The situation turned favorable again. Observing the buying and selling lines, the bullish side still held the advantage. Future developments suggest the possibility of both Type A and Type B bonds reaching new highs. In the morning, initial trading saw Type C bonds gradually decline due to selling by Hongda, Datong, Kang Sheng, Xinglianhe, and others, even falling below two yuan. Simultaneously, Yongchang absorbed a large quantity, initially unnoticed. Later, Yitai, Gongmao, Xie Kang, and Xinhua all started buying, and the sellers gradually reduced their positions. The morning session closed with a slight decrease of five to six jiao. In the afternoon, Yongchang continued buying with strong backing, and Yitai and Gongmao also continued their purchases. Xinfu, Hefeng, Xie Xing, and Yuan Jin also displayed strength. Hongda stopped selling. Runde, Lianhe, and Dechang and Shun all sold, but supply still exceeded demand.

### Food: May Rice Shipments to Shanghai Exceeded 365,000 Bags; Rice Prices Continued to Decline Yesterday

After the Shanghai Municipal Council sold cheap imported rice, local rice prices have fallen. Recently, due to the war between Germany and the Soviet Union, some rice speculators have spread rumors to raise prices, causing them to rise by about 10 yuan in the past few days, excluding the Council's cheap rice. However, sources indicate that there is no concern about the supply of imported rice, except for potential issues in the Pacific. There is no shortage of rice ships. Although imported rice in May decreased compared to the previous months, it is still sufficient to meet demand. The total amount of rice arriving in Shanghai last month is recorded below: A total of 365,317 bags of imported rice arrived in Shanghai in May, including 100,789 bags directly from Saigon, 41,785 bags directly from Siam, 30,000 bags directly from Rangoon, and 10,300 bags directly from Java. The rest were transshipped from Hong Kong. The Council's cheap imported rice is also included in this total. (Zu)

The imported rice market continued its downward trend yesterday, with both spot and futures prices declining. British and Chinese Saigon No. 1 broken rice was considered soft, while broken rice from the interior was in demand, making that segment slightly better. However, the direct ordering of American and Chinese rice by foreign merchants caused the price of original bags to fall slightly. Spot original bags of mixed broken rice traded at 117 yuan, and futures traded at 113-114 yuan, which was still 1-2 yuan lower. The spot market initially strengthened, with high-grade broken rice trading at 99.5 yuan, but then retreated to 98 yuan as speculators unloaded inventory. No. 1 Saigon was trading at 129.5-128.5 yuan, while British and Chinese rice was trading at 150-140 yuan, 5-7 yuan lower than the recent opening price of 155-156 yuan. Small-grain rice was trading at 124-125 yuan to 122.5 yuan, with a slower decline. However, spot British and Chinese rice, previously trading at 151-152 yuan, was only trading at 148.5 yuan yesterday. Other high-grade rice also declined. No. 2 Saigon high-white rice was trading at 121 yuan and 5 jiao, medium-grade at 118-119 yuan, No. 1 Siamese at 130 yuan, mid-grade at 125 yuan, No. 2 at 120-119 yuan, Mindang at 130 yuan and 128 yuan, Gya Fuo rice at 125-126 yuan, and Tokyo Bipoint at 116-114 yuan, a further decline of 2-3 yuan.

Due to heavy rain yesterday, the supply of thick and thin japonica domestic rice was disrupted, and sellers became more resistant. Although sales were sluggish in local stores, there was little change in the market. Nangang fresh early rice was mostly market goods, and prices were relatively high, continuing to decline slightly by about a yuan. Wuxi original bags of late japonica remained stable, trading at 131-128 yuan.

Both domestic and imported glutinous rice struggled to find buyers, and the market remained weak. The price of imported glutinous rice followed the decline of imported rice, falling by 1-2 yuan, with Hong Kong white glutinous rice trading at 121-122 yuan, declining to 118 yuan. Domestic glutinous rice suffered further due to intermittent rain, with sellers hesitant to buy. The market was weak, declining by about 3 yuan, with high-grade rice trading at 104-105 yuan, declining to 102 yuan.

### Flour and Wheat Trading Quiet

Trading in imported flour was quite quiet. Over 40,000 bags of flour have arrived from Hong Kong and are being unloaded. Floating profits were frequently taken, leading to an oversupply. At the opening, Golden Dragon flour once fell below the 32 yuan mark, opening at only 31.9 yuan. However, local retail sales provided some support, and the price rebounded to 32.1 yuan, similar to the previous day's closing price. Other goods maintained levels. Flower Bird brand Australian flour and Fort brand American flour were both offered at 33 yuan, without attracting buyers. Wheat trading remained suspended.

### Oil Cakes and Soybeans: Shipments from the Northeast Blocked; Potential Dumping in Shanghai Market; Oil Prices Plunge Again by Four Yuan

The market for miscellaneous grains, soybeans, and oil cakes was weak yesterday. Rumors that shipments of soybeans from the Northeast were blocked and might be diverted to Shanghai made the market nervous. Oil merchants found it difficult to maintain prices, and cooking oil prices plunged again by 3-4 yuan. Soybeans fell back by 0.5-1 yuan, and oil cakes declined by 0.5-0.6 yuan. Other grains such as corn were also weak. Total sales included 100 cans of Yanting raw oil, over 200 dan of Qingyou oil from Dayou Factory, over 600 bags of soybeans from Tianjin, Guide, and Qingdao, and nearly 1,000 bags of corn from Saigon and Holland. Shenji forward and spot oil cakes traded over 30,000 pieces (prices detailed in the market price section).

### Textiles: Fabric Speculation Continues to Drive Uptrend

Factory-made fabrics: Yesterday, influenced by the rising prices of eastern textiles, sellers of various fabrics tightened supply. Trading activity was noticeable. Woodcutters saw the market rise and made some purchases. As a result, a portion of fine fabrics and twills rose by about 5 jiao per bolt, coarse fabrics rose by 2.5 jiao, and bleached and colored fabrics rose by 5 jiao. Local trading included over 300 pieces of coarse, fine, and colored fabrics. Hong Kong buyers purchased coarse and fine twills and colored fabrics. Southeast Asian buyers purchased printed and bleached fabrics and twills.

Eastern textiles: The uptrend was strong again due to the increasing activity in local dyeing and sales. Northern buyers purchased mid-range fine fabrics, boosting market sentiment. Futures prices for fine fabrics on the exchange soared by 1.2-1.3 yuan per bolt. The closing price for the leading dragon head brand in the spot market was 47.3 yuan in the afternoon. Colored goods, especially four gentlemen twill, were offered at a high of 1.6 yuan, closing slightly lower at 1.595 yuan, but the market was tight.

### Sugar Market: Upper-Grade Refined White Sugar Firmer

The sugar market trended flat and soft yesterday. The guild set the price for spot second-grade coarse white sugar at 91 yuan for new goods from the June import and 87.6 yuan for older goods. January imports were only 87.3 yuan. The upper grade of Taikoo refined white sugar was strong, while the lower grade was soft. B mark West Warehouse old goods were 105.8 yuan, West Warehouse new goods were 106.2 yuan, road goods were 106.4 yuan, and HX mark was 88.6 yuan. Small jiao, lacking other transactions.

### Dried Goods: Orchid Bamboo Branches Increase

About a hundred boxes of aged orchid bamboo branches recently arrived. Samples were available yesterday, and the goods were of good quality. Although sales were not high, the poor harvest of new goods this year is undeniable, and the price of old goods was also driven higher, immediately increasing by 4-5 yuan. Kuilan needs to be increased accordingly. However, black leaf branches were flat due to wormholes.

### Seafood: Fennel Retracts

Demand for fennel has recently weakened, causing the market to soften. The market price once reached 320 yuan, but now few buyers are willing to pay even 310 yuan. The trend is likely to soften further, but the base is still solid, and there is unlikely to be too much of a decline.

### Coal: Coal Briquette Manufacturers Control Market

Coal briquette prices are currently being tightly controlled by manufacturers, who are using the German-Soviet conflict as an excuse to increase prices due to the expected increase in shipping costs. This has caused the gray market to rise again, with prices increasing by 6-7 yuan. Goods from large factories are priced at 306 yuan per ton, while goods from small factories are around 290 yuan. Local stores are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach, pricing coal at 17 yuan per dan, but most stores are still holding the original price of 16 yuan.

### Miscellaneous: Gunny Sacks Continue to Increase

The supply of gunny sacks is lacking, causing the market to tighten further. New 2.5-pound green sacks have increased by about a yuan, to 8 yuan. Other sizes have increased by 6-7 jiao to several jiao. Prices for various grades are listed below:

Grade Price per 1,000 sacks

2.5 lb new green warp 7,800

### YMCA Organizes Swimming Classes for Male and Female Students

The local Chinese Christian YMCA has spared no effort in promoting swimming every summer, teaching beginners to swim and cultivating many talents. The Sichuan Road swimming pool was originally planned to be closed this summer due to a sharp increase in water and electricity costs. However, in consideration of the needs of members and young men and women on the isolated island for swimming, the association is now openly soliciting 300 basic swimming comrades to register at the association's office starting today, with a deadline of July 14. If the number of people is insufficient by then, there will still be no hope of opening. In addition, the association is recruiting 200 male and female students for summer swimming fitness classes and 700 for beginner swimming classes. The registration location is the same as above. Detailed information is available upon request.

### What Can You Do to Me!

— Pan Li

A few days ago, a photo like this appeared in a foreign newspaper.

It was taken in the bombed area of ​​London. The location was a bombed church, with the church’s arched doorway and glass windows as the background, and rubble all over the ground. Three people stood in the rubble. One was a priest in white robes and black robes, raising his right hand in a blessing gesture; a young couple stood in the front. The man was wearing a military uniform, and the woman was wearing ordinary clothes. They set the location and auspicious day, and were preparing to hold a wedding ceremony in this church. Unexpectedly, the German plane came the night before the wedding and bombed the church. But they didn’t care about anything and were still determined to get married at the selected time and place.

In modern warfare, the purpose of bombing cities is not only to destroy materials, but also to scare away the people in the rear, so that they cannot continue their normal and stable lives. However, judging from the various facts that have occurred in the past, airplanes and bombs do not seem to be able to scare away the morale of the people, because the people are all "brave after repeated battles!"

This young couple gave a rather strong and powerful sarcasm and answer to the German plane's indiscriminate bombing. They seemed to be saying: What can you do to me!"

Psychology

### Psychology of Air Raids

— Fei

I have been in the accompanying capital for a full three years. According to statistics, the time spent in the air-raid shelter (we usually say "cave") is quite alarming. Like food, clothing, housing, and transportation, "cave" has also been included as one of the essential elements of life.

Based on three years of experience in the cave, I have seen that the general public's psychology regarding air raids will change over time:

(1) Curiosity, adventure; (2) Panic, extreme fear: (3) Relaxation; (4) Calm, cautious.

Personally speaking, when I first heard an air raid alarm in the summer of the first year, I felt indescribably excited and joyful. I quickly ran out of the ward, holding a telescope, and looked for a "iron crow over there"? Seeing the plane flying past and the all-clear bell ringing, it would disappoint me for a while!

After some time, after experiencing the baptism of fire and blood, and seeing the tragic scenes of broken walls and fragmented corpses, I couldn't help but tremble when I recalled my adventurous actions at the beginning.

The psychological transformation is easy to flip from the South Pole to the North Pole. After that day, the air raid alarm was as terrible as hell. My legs would fly like hair to the air-raid shelter, and reason completely lost control.

With a burst of bombing, I worried that every bomb would fall on my head, and my eardrums became particularly sensitive: a car passing by was a plane, thunder was a plane, the power plant releasing furnace water was a plane,…… Every past rhyme would abstractly feel similar.

One day, in the midst of the frantic ringing of an urgent alarm and the densest strafing of machine guns, we had no time to hide in the cave. I covered my ears and ran around the house like a horse; Fen Mei hid under the vegetable table, with a coal basket covering her head, and her teeth chattering like drums.

After the incident, half of my straw slippers were gone, and Fen looked like a little black ghost. The two people were "embarrassed" compared to each other and wanted to ask each other, "Why bother?" But no one said it!

There are many jokes, which can be "deduced by analogy".

Gradually, due to the formation of the environment, we became indifferent to the air-raid problem again:

For example, the shortening of the alarm release time, the smallness of the affected area, the fatigue of the body,…… naturally, we would despise it.

——Yes, it's just a disturbance for a while, why rush?

——Jialing South Bank was bombed yesterday, and it won't come to the Western suburbs again today!

Their target is probably the ×× factory in the west.

We are like human air force staff officers, and we seem to understand everything: no one wants to step into the mud cave again with their newly polished shoes, and coupled with several "empty" alarms, our hearts become more and more relaxed every day, and everyone is too lazy to take a step.

But, after all, the power of gunpowder is great——Boom! Boom! Boom! The house shook, the window turned red, anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, water dragons, crying and laughing, were a historical picture, a symphony, and your heart couldn't help but beat faster.

Everyone wants their lives, especially us at this time, everything is tied to our country, and we can't just throw away our lives.

We are entering the cave again. But, it is rational, it is calm, our hearts are very calm! Our teeth are clenched tightly, this is not fear, this is deep hatred!

It is "bombing season" again.

I am spending this "suffering" time in the cave again!

Although air raids are frequent, we don't

### Qiu Haitang

— Qin Shouou

(9) A Strange Farmer

He suddenly heard a person's voice saying this dozens of steps away from the door: At first, he didn't pay attention to it, but the second person's reply grabbed his attention. It was the voice of his cousin.

"Actually, my brother is not a monster, and his personality is gentle... I thought he was bored alone, and I wanted to find a woman to accompany him, so I wanted you to earn some money. I didn't expect you to be unwilling!" Wu Da seemed to say indignantly.

"Looking for it! Even the fairy was scared to death when she saw his face!" another person said.

Qiu Haitang squatted on the ground, listening attentively to them, and almost burst into tears immediately. He really wanted to shout at the top of his voice: "My face was not born so ugly!"

But he would not do that after all.

When Wu Da lazily walked back into the room, he saw Qiu Haitang already lying on the bed, without any sound. He couldn't help but wonder why he fell asleep so early.

In fact, Qiu Haitang, of course, didn't close his eyes all night again. He felt that he couldn't endure the humiliation of others any longer, and at the same time, he didn't have the courage to find Xiang Qi again; in case Xiang Qi saw his face, which now looks seven parts like a ghost and three parts like a human, and was as afraid and disgusted as others, wouldn't that be even more painful than not seeing her?

"Even if she can regain her freedom, what's the fun of living with an ugly man?" He thought over and over again.

Early the next morning, Wu Da was awakened by Qiu Haitang in his sleep.

"Brother, I really don't want to go to the stage anymore. Please take a trip for me." He put two passbooks and a letter on the table. "This letter was written by me last night. There are place names and names on it. If you find this person, he will handle things for me. Please take the box and parts with you too!"

Wu Da struggled to open his sleepy eyes, silently looking at him in a daze, unable to understand why he had suddenly changed his mind. (142) (End of Section 9)——

Invention

### Night Light Cane

— Ke Zhong

This is not a mysterious thing in some strange story, but a cane to help blind people walk at night. This cane is equipped with a battery and a light bulb on the handle, which can emit light at night, so that people driving cars and other pedestrians on the road can see at a glance that someone is walking, so as to avoid the tragedy of collisions.

This kind of night light cane is also a great convenience even for ordinary night walkers, especially in places where light control is often implemented, it can be used to replace electric torches or street lights.

Science

### Hair Doesn't Die

— Mo Ming

After a person dies, there is only the saying that "the spirit does not die", and I have never heard of any "hair does not die". The British medical scientist Kahui once saw the hair of a corpse buried for four years extending from the cracks in the coffin in 1877. The person had been groomed during the funeral, but after years of sleeping, his hair grew to eighteen inches, his beard to eight inches, and the hair on his chest to four to six inches. A man named Weis in Washington also witnessed the corpse of a girl who was twelve or thirteen years old when she died, but her hair continued to grow in the coffin and eventually extended to her heels. Many people have also reported the miracle that parts such as hair and nails are not easily decayed and continue to grow after a person dies.

The death of the human body can be divided into two steps. First, the death of organs, such as the cessation of activity of major internal organs such as the heart, lungs, and brain. Afterwards is the death of molecules, at which time the cells throughout the body just lose their vitality. Although there is a period of time in between, it is undoubtedly very short, because after the circulation of oxygen in the human body is cut off, the metabolism of cells cannot continue. Old cells die one by one, and new cells are not produced, so complete death cannot be avoided. According to Chetner Smith's opinion, the time between the death of human organs and complete molecular death does not exceed three or four hours at most (animals such as the Chinese doll are longer). Therefore, the bones and skin of a person who has just died can be "grafted" onto the injured or disabled. From this, it can be inferred that even if the hair of a dead person can grow, the growth within three or four hours is extremely limited. Many experts believe that the more likely reason is that the contraction of the skin and soft parts after death will squeeze out some of the hair or nails, but the elongation of the road is still very limited. Therefore, if the above-mentioned stories are not fictitious, they are at least uncommon anecdotes.

### Dr. Dafu Opposes the Dionne Quintuplets Devoting Themselves to the Screen

— Qinghui

The Dionne quintuplets, who have devoted themselves to the screen, were lively and lovely in the past few films, but because of their young age, it seems that they have not been able to fully display their talents in acting. Now they are seven years old, and each of them is smart, lively, healthy and beautiful, so many filmmakers hope to sign a contract with them, but Dr. Dafu flatly refused. His reason is this:

"When the quintuplets were still children, I didn't want them to join the film industry. I just wanted them to experience the experiences of ordinary children and grow up like ordinary children. Pointing out to them the distinction between good and evil and helping them with their needs, I will never use my power to make them a hateful life of a child star. Childhood life is the foundation of being a person, and preparations for being a person can be gradually completed during these years. If you ask him to make movies, he will be trained in acting and learn how to cry and laugh. Learn how to mix with adults, talk and understand each other. Then, his childhood life is completely sacrificed."

"For example, Shirley Temple, she is a lively and lovely child, she gets along very well with many adults in the studio. Adults often talk to her, just like with other adult actresses. I suspect that one day she will ask herself the question: "What did I miss? What exactly is the precious childhood life that people think is? My childhood life is just lines, expressions, premiere ceremonies, fan clubs...etc., where is what I should have?" Maybe she will say to her parents: "You took it away, you were good intentions, but you took away the most precious thing from me.""

"Judging from many facts, a child star ends at the age of sixteen. For other children, that is the beginning of a lifetime! When other children begin to learn all kinds of things about being a person, child stars have already forgotten. Because she learned it from a young age, like a parrot learning to speak, now she seems to be old and no longer lively and clever, and she begins to feel confused and wandering."

"It's over at sixteen! The thought of this makes me shudder, but such an example happened not long ago! It was a child star who had grown up, and he found that everything had disappeared, even the money he had earned had disappeared. Of course, there are exceptions, and I believe Shirley Temple is one of them. But there are very few people in the world like Shirley. I am not saying that Hollywood is an evil place, and children working in films will never be morally low, and the discipline will be very good. In fact, the discipline will be too good. What I am concerned about is that a child's pure soul, why should it be turned into a rigid model? Therefore, I hope they can enjoy a happy childhood life."

Finally, Dr. Dafu said with a smile: "I still remember how happy my childhood was. Although it was just a small thing, when I recall it now, I always feel infinite taste. But I know that the taste of this kind of life is definitely not something that ordinary famous child stars can enjoy, and at the same time, this regret cannot be compensated by reputation and money."

This is undeniable. In every public place, the people who participate in the games have different classes, and it is difficult to distinguish between the good and the bad. How can the skating rink be an exception? Therefore, the content of some places does not need to be asked; the ground of Shuimenting is surrounded by rough hemp ropes, and the shoes are iron-wheeled disks, which is not without danger when skating. "Wing On" is considered noble, and the equipment inside is also more complete. The oiled wooden floor and shoes are all from foreign countries, and the wheels are made of iron and plastic, which makes skating fast and comfortable. However, strictly speaking, the impression they gave people when they first opened was not bad, but now they have also suffered a fatal blow from the "uneven quality".

### Blood Rain Qiongpa

Chapter 11: Heroic Posture Comes to Battle

Wang Yongtai closed his eyes, gritted his teeth and said: "So the bandits have come to attack the city. So rampant, extremely hateful! Why doesn't my nephew follow General Zhou to kill the bandits? What are you waiting for an old man like me who is about to die? Can't kill all the bandits?" God! God!" Wang Yongtai was filled with indignation, and shouted several times the word "hate". The arrow wound cracked, his feet straightened, and he passed away in hatred. Xu Jing mourned over the body. Wang Yongtai had no children, and He Ji had long since passed away. There was no one else in the family, so Xu Jing naturally took care of the aftermath. In the evening, the bandits stopped attacking the city, and Zhou Yuji returned to the yamen from the city. Xu Jing told him what Wang Yongtai had said before his death. Zhou Yuji listened, tears dripping on his clothes, and he was filled with regret. He said to Xu Jing: "The old hero Wang has been with me for many years, and I was expecting him to help me kill the bandits and make contributions to the country. Who knew that he would pass away before me? Although he sought benevolence and got benevolence, and his name will be passed down for generations, it is a pity that he could not help me kill a few more bandits. Isn't it a pity? This is no different from breaking my arm. Before the army left, the hero died first, and it has always made heroes weep." After saying that, he and Xu Jing looked at each other with tears in their eyes, and then he ordered his men to prepare high-quality coffins for Wang Yongtai and bury him with preferential treatment. Xu Jing, of course, did all these things. The bandits had already pressed down on the city, and Zhou Yuji was busy with military affairs, so how could he have time to take care of it? The next day, Li Zicheng personally led his troops directly to the city. The bandits attacked the city even more fiercely. Zhou Yuji and Zhang Lie and Fan Cheng tried their best to resist on the city. The bandits set up cloud ladders one after another, trying to climb to the top of the city, but they were all shot down by Zhou Yuji with rockets, breaking the cloud ladders and killing many bandit soldiers. Li Zicheng was furious, and taught the bandits to shoot arrows at the city. Zhou Yuji also ordered his men to shoot arrows. The two sides shot at each other for a while, and in the end, the people under the city suffered. Xu Jing buried Wang Yongtai and came to the city to see Zhou Yuji, asking for orders to leave the city. It happened that Li Zicheng, because he could not attack, taught the bandit general a tiger to lead the bandits, naked, pointing at Zhou Yuji's name under the city, and insulting him repeatedly, trying to anger Zhou Yuji and lure him out to fight.

### Talking about Ice Rinks on the Sea (Part 1)

— Yuan Shen

I remember when skating was popular in Shanghai, it was very popular among many young men and women. At that time, there were skating rinks in the east and skating rinks in the west. Naturally, there were not a few people who worked hard to promote it. "Lafayette" "Wing On". "Daxin" "Dahua". "Great World" and other skating rinks were first produced, and then there was the emergence of "Yindu". "Yindu" was completely built and arranged in imitation of Hollywood's skating rinks. The skates used were also completely the same as the ice skates worn by Hollywood star Sonja Henie. The quad skates are fundamentally different. When it first opened, business was still good, but after some time
