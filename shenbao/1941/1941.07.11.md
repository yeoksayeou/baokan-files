### Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi's Broadcast: Democratic Nations Should Strengthen Cooperation. British Foreign Secretary Eden Assures All Efforts to Help China Maintain Independence. U.S. Export-Import Bank Negotiates a New Agreement with China.

Chongqing: Chinese Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi broadcast to the Chinese public last night, saying, "The international and anti-aggression front, which has been suggested for a long time but failed to materialize, is now gradually taking shape. We cannot help but feel delighted to witness this situation. But at the same time, we cannot help but recall the many countries that have been sacrificed and invaded, and the people who live under the iron heel of the aggressors due to the harm of the appeasement policy." Foreign Minister Guo declared, "The reason why aggressors have been able to do whatever they want is that the aggressed have been unable to resist in unity. Thus, the aggressors have been able to defeat the aggressed one by one." "Anti-aggression countries should no longer resist alone, and should no longer harbor the selfish idea of ​​sacrificing other countries to protect their own. Otherwise, the power of the aggressors will grow day by day, and in the future, what they want and are willing to get will be swallowed up." Guo appealed to democratic countries to cooperate further, and greatly praised the recent dispatch of military and economic delegations to the Soviet Union by the United Kingdom. In commenting on the aggressors, Guo also said that since the invasion of Greece, Italy has felt itself in a most uneasy position, and Japan's "muddy feet" are also deeply mired in China. Although it threatens loudly to the south and north, it can no longer move. And Germany is currently unable to achieve a decisive victory. As for the anti-aggression countries, especially after the Soviet Union joined, in terms of land, population, and resources, they have been able to defeat the aggressor countries.

This policy is based on the recognition of Chongqing as the legitimate Chinese National Government. On July 7, China entered its fifth year of war. I am now pleased to reiterate the protection I recently issued in the House of Commons, that the British government will continue to do everything possible to assist China in maintaining its independence.

Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today advocated that the anti-aggression group should adopt Axis tactics and immediately attack the weakest of the aggressor groups in order to defeat the aggressors. Reviewing the world situation, the spokesperson said, "The fates of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are interconnected. If this anti-aggression group wants to defeat the aggressor countries and destroy their plan to defeat the enemy one by one, the best strategy is to adopt the same strategy, first attack the weakest of the aggressor countries." The spokesperson believed that the imperial conference held in Tokyo on July 2, in addition to announcing the policy of abiding by the Japan-Soviet Pact and the Tripartite Pact, had more important reasons. The spokesperson said that Japan's current calmness seemed to be the calm before a storm. He also pointed out that on the day after the meeting of the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Company in Tokyo, market prices had fallen sharply. He also said that he wished to warn Britain and the United States not to regard Japan's southward and northward advances as two separate things. If Japan's adventures in the north and south were successful, it would greatly increase its strength and proceed to control the region from Alaska to South America. The spokesperson also said that China was already at war with Japan, so it was willing to cooperate with other anti-aggression countries. (United Press dispatch of the 10th)

### Generalissimo Chiang's Message to the Military and Civilians of the Country

Chongqing: (Continued from yesterday) I believe that military affairs, education, and economy all have their own key points. We must start from each key point, and then we can meet the needs and achieve twice the result with half the effort. To be specific, (1) In military affairs, we must pay attention to spirit and discipline. The first thing we need to do in building our army is to cultivate the spirit of loyalty, courage, and sacrifice in the general officers and soldiers, the spirit of fighting for every inch of land and doing their best, and even more so to create a discipline of common unity in advancement and retreat, life and death, the discipline of carrying out orders and thoroughly implementing them. With a vigorous spirit and strict discipline, the power of combat technology and combat equipment can be fully exerted to achieve the ultimate goal of victory. (2) In education, we must pay special attention to moral education and physical education. The transmission of general youth knowledge and skills is secondary to us. The most important thing is to cultivate the youth's character, hone the students' personality, so that they can consciously become the youth citizens of modern China, pay attention to our national philosophy, restore our inherent national morality, and on the one hand, we must make every youth endure hardship, constantly practice, and create a strong and solid physique, be able to endure all hardships, and bear any arduous task. If these two goals can be achieved, our educational construction can succeed. (3) In the economic field, we must pay special attention to production and transportation. We are now lagging behind in everything, and material construction has no foundation, so we must first pay attention to production. Whether it is industry, mining, or agriculture, the government and the people must work together, public and private, and advance at the same pace, with control, planning, and rewards. In particular, the people must be able to endure hardship and work diligently in production. At the same time, we must actively promote transportation construction, so that water and land transportation can be opened as much as possible, and goods can be transported in all directions without obstruction. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that the smooth flow of goods is the basis of all economic construction. With sufficient production and smooth transportation, we can meet all the needs of wartime and lay the foundation for post-war construction. The above is to explain the key points of construction from the three aspects of military affairs, education, and economy. In addition, all political laws and measures, all related to local autonomy, grassroots politics, and the implementation of the new county system in people's lives, such as the recent laws on land policy and food management, etc., I hope that all compatriots across the country will sincerely accept, work together, and implement them in unison. These are the essential plans for building the country. We must catch up quickly and seek their realization in order to meet the current needs of the country and comfort the compatriots who have sacrificed and fought for the sake of resistance and construction in the past four years. The world situation is rapidly developing and has reached the final stage of using national strength to fight for freedom and survival. In my New Year's Day this year, I declared to our people, "This year will be the most difficult and important period in our history." All of our military and civilians must know that the struggle of the past four years is not considered hard, and the hardships ahead will be ten or a hundred times greater than this. Light is ahead of us, and heavy responsibilities are on our shoulders. All the freedom-loving nations of the world are expecting our success and progress with sincere sympathy. All of our compatriots, swear courage and work hard forward. (Dispatch of the 6th)

Editorial

### An Analysis of the Nazi Invasion of the Soviet Union

The outbreak of the Soviet-German war has been nearly three weeks now. Although this is only a short period of time, it is a figure that cannot be ignored in the Nazi's past war history. Whether it was Poland, the Western Front, or even the recent battles of Greece and Crete, decisive victories were achieved within three weeks. But now, this glory worthy of boasting has passed. In the past ten days of the invasion of the Soviet Union, it cannot be denied that the German army has made some progress, but it is very different from previous battles. It mobilized almost unprecedented full strength, but the effect is only seen in the outer areas outside the Soviet homeland. Wherever it invaded the Soviet homeland, it encountered even stronger resistance. Combining the information from both sides for comparison, it is credible that the German army has lost its invincible authority in front of a strong enemy, and no city on Soviet soil has been occupied by the German army so far (Minsk has not yet fallen). Even Leningrad and Kyiv, which are very close to the border, seem to be always within reach. Even if it cannot be immediately concluded that Hitler will definitely repeat Napoleon's mistakes, his own weaknesses have begun to be exposed.

Although Hitler violated the traditional strategic lessons of Germany since Schlieffen this time, and risked the great disadvantage of fighting on two fronts, it has in fact given him the convenience of fighting on only one front until now. It is enough to cope with considerable defense on the Western Front and other places. The joint operations between the democratic countries and the Soviet Union are still only objectively possible. Apart from mutual consultation and negotiation, there is no further expression, which makes some people who are happy to see the rapid success of the international anti-aggression front extremely anxious. If the Soviet army's resistance is only comparable to that of the French army, which is known as the world's number one, then not only Ukraine and the Caucasus will become the Axis's possessions, but also the battles for the Atlantic and the North Sea will follow. Hitler may have expected that this kind of cooperation would be difficult to achieve, so he dared to invade the Soviet Union, but even if his judgment was not wrong on this point, he had a greater failure in other aspects. First, what he hoped from Britain and other neutral countries was mainly the formation of an anti-Soviet crusade, but because the British people's perception was very different from before the war, and Churchill was a consistently anti-Nazi hardliner, the result of Hess's mission to Britain was only complete humiliation. Internationally, apart from some vassals echoing, and Turkey being forced to remain neutral, he did not get important cheers and help. Second, Hitler's estimation of the Soviet military strength was probably based on the level of the Soviet-Finnish War, and he ignored the Red Army's mobility and the essential difference between the Soviet-Finnish and Soviet-German wars. If he had expected the Soviet army's resistance to be so tenacious and tricky, he would probably not have wasted such a huge price on the Eastern battlefield. Third, the Nazi authorities underestimated the Soviet people's patriotic sentiments because of the many political changes in the Soviet Union in recent years, and overestimated the differences in their internal political opinions. His intention was probably to think that since there were some White Russian remnants abroad in the Soviet Union, even after the previous purges, there would inevitably be some dissatisfied elements lurking within the current authorities, who could play the role of the fifth column and Quisling once the army was approaching. However, the national concept of the Slavic nation has always been extremely strong. Historical grievances and differences of opinion are nothing compared to the large-scale invasion of enemy troops. The White Russian repatriation movement has shown that past hatred has faded with time. Even in Shanghai, one can often hear the argument that "the Communist Party is my political enemy, but I am still Russian." This shows that the national concept is deeply rooted in people's minds. Even if prejudices have not been completely eliminated, in the autumn of major crisis, unified resistance is the priority. The two major nations of China and the Soviet Union have the same performance on this point. In history, there have been cases where internal strife occurred during the war, leading to the overthrow of the regime, but that was only limited to wars that did not represent the interests of the people and had no hope of winning, or domestic politics were too dark for the people to bear. In the late stages of the last World War, Germany was the representative of the former situation, and Imperial Russia was the obvious example of the latter. As for today's world, perhaps only some aggressor countries have these signs. Under the leadership of a government that is determined to resist aggression, even if there are great hardships and difficulties, the people can only endure them and closely link their fate with the fate of the country and the nation. Only in this way can the country, the nation, and the individual have a bright future. However, this is something that the aggressors can absolutely not understand.

To observe more deeply: Hitler's failure did not begin when he launched the attack on the Soviet Union, but was doomed when he failed to attack the British Isles last autumn. Since then, the Nazis turned eastward. From managing Romania to the end of the war in Greece and Crete, it showed that he was doing his best to block the loopholes in southeastern Europe to avoid being attacked. Then he turned north again to fight the main battle against the Soviet Union. This procedure, although seemingly well-commanded, was actually entirely due to the failure of the attack on Britain. As the United States' aid to Britain became increasingly active and seemed to treat it as a non-warring enemy, the Nazis did not only not resist head-on, but unexpectedly attacked the Soviet Union, which had always been cautious towards Germany. This was cowardice and evasion. His expectation of obtaining Britain's compromise and support through anti-Sovietism shows that his war against Britain has fallen into a state of wanting to stop but being unable to.

In this European war, the most outstanding achievements in fighting against Germany were made by small Greece and huge Soviet Union, which are in stark contrast to China in the Far East, and are shining infinitely in today's history. Because of the disparity in size, strength, and weakness between the Soviet Union and Greece, even if their bravery is the same, their endings may be very different. As for Britain, the difficult and isolated support for the dangerous situation in recent years is certainly worthy of sympathy, but there are not many great achievements, which is regrettable. Now that the Nazi decline has been revealed, it is just the time for the brave men of Great Britain to show their skills. The Germans mocked the British army for only being good at performing Dunkirk-style retreats. This ridicule is worth answering with more powerful facts.

### Lattimore Discusses the Mongolian Issue, Says War Between the Two Sides is Almost Inevitable

Local News: The Millard's Review, which will be published tomorrow, said that the appointment of Lattimore, an American expert on Far Eastern issues, as Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's political advisor has a special political significance, which is that Lattimore is the most accomplished scholar in the United States in the study of Mongolian issues. His lifetime works on this aspect include "Mongol Journeys", "The Desert Road to Turkestan", "Manchuria: Cradle of Conflict", "The Mongols of Manchuria", and "Inner Asian Frontiers of China". But Lattimore is not only familiar with Mongolian issues, he also has extensive knowledge of Northeast and North China, because he has lived in these areas for many years. Lattimore was born in Washington, D.C. in the year of the Boxer Rebellion. His childhood was spent in China, especially when he lived in Tianjin. He then went to study in Britain and Switzerland. He returned to China at the age of nineteen to do business and wrote for the Beijing-Tianjin Times. In the fifteenth and sixteenth years of the Republic of China, he first roamed Mongolia and Xinjiang. He and his wife then traveled from China to India. Since 1929, he has developed relationships with several universities and academic institutions. Because of his deep knowledge of Chinese and Mongolian languages, he has become an authority in this area. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, he was awarded by the Royal Geographical Society of the United Kingdom. In the twenty-second year, he won the gold medal from the Geographical Society of Philadelphia in the United States. He is associated with the Pacific Council and serves as the editor of the Pacific Affairs quarterly. He has recently also served as the director of the International School of Johns Hopkins University. In his book "The Mongols of Manchuria", he expressed his views on Japan's invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia, saying that if Japan continues to expand into Inner Mongolia, the conflict between Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia will also be unavoidable. This is determined by geographical and political factors. In the east and south, Inner Mongolia has surrounded Outer Mongolia. Using the railways and ports of the Northeast, Inner Mongolia can open a sea route for the export of Outer Mongolia's products, but at present, they all have to pass through Siberia. The unification of Inner Mongolia and its integration with the Northeast will create a new Mongolian border, making both Siberia and the Northeast vulnerable to attack. Therefore, the two sides can hardly coexist for a long time without resorting to force.

### 敎育部救濟　貧苦學生情形　戰後會設各項貸金

Chongqing. Today, the person in charge of the Ministry of Education issued a statement saying that since the start of the War of Resistance and National Construction, the government has established a loan system to help poor students in the war zones. The types of loans include food loans, special loans, pocket money loans, and uniform loans. Among them, food loans are the most important. Initially, the amount was fixed each month. However, since the price of rice soared last winter, the Ministry, considering that a fixed amount could not maintain the students' nutrition, changed the method to calculate the amount based on the price of rice in the school's location, with each person receiving the equivalent of two 市斗 and one 升 of rice, plus the fuel, salt, vegetables, and cook's wages required for meals, as a full food loan amount. Based on current prices in Sichuan Province, the government bears approximately 90 to 100 yuan per month for students receiving the full food loan amount, or about 1,100 to 1,200 yuan per year. The higher the price, the greater the burden. And that does not include the special pocket money and uniform loans. For students from national schools in non-war zones who are experiencing financial difficulties at home, in addition to the 18 yuan paid by the students themselves, the full or half amount of the food loan standard for students in war zones is also subsidized. Currently, for a student in Sichuan receiving a full subsidy for food loans, the government bears 70 to 80 yuan per month, or less than 1,000 yuan per year. In total, the total amount of student loans in the war zones and subsidies for food loans for students in non-war zones is estimated to be no less than 50 million yuan per year at current prices. In addition, 1 million yuan is allocated to private universities and secondary schools relocated to Sichuan, and 1.4 million yuan is allocated to private primary, secondary, and universities in Shanghai to help teachers and students. During this period of the War of Resistance and National Construction, when the national treasury is strained, the government can still raise huge sums of money and do its best to provide relief. Its painstaking efforts to maintain the studies of students in difficulty are recognized by the 50,000 young people and the public who have benefited from it. It is rumored that some lawless people intentionally try to distort right and wrong, hoping to incite young people and fabricate rumors about how difficult the lives of students in the rear are, in order to cause students to withdraw from school and lose their schooling, so as to carry out their conspiracies. Fortunately, the patriotic youth in our schools will surely use the iron facts to break their cunning plans, and the social figures will be able to use the sincerity of caring for their children to put out these bad and shameless rumors.

### 叙利亞休戰談判　內容傳包括十點　維希戰具須悉數交與協約軍由美領事居間傳遞雙方公文

Reuters, Cairo, 10th. According to responsible sources here, Allied Commander General Wilson broadcast last night, urging Vichy forces to withdraw from Beirut and requesting a reply by 5:30 this morning. However, as of this afternoon, no reply has been received from General Dentz, so the fighting in the coastal areas and other places is still continuing. Wilson's broadcast last night, issued by the Jerusalem radio station, urged Dentz to quickly declare Beirut a demilitarized city and withdraw his troops. If Dentz refuses, he will have no choice but to take the necessary military measures to occupy the city. Wilson also reminded Dentz to quickly take the same decision as a year ago, because at that time, Dentz had strongly advocated the withdrawal of all French troops from Paris in order to avoid the devastation of the people. Wilson also said that if his appeal is rejected, all civilian losses or any deaths will be the responsibility of Dentz. The above news that the war is still in progress is mutually contradictory to the unconfirmed rumors that the Syrian French authorities have signed an armistice agreement with representatives of the Allied forces. It is heard that the content of the armistice agreement includes the following ten points: (1) Britain has no territorial ambitions in Syria or Lebanon, and only wants to ensure that the two places will not be used by the enemy as a naval and land base. (2) French interests will be protected by the Free French Army in the organization guaranteed by Britain for the independence of Syria. (3) The Vichy army should transfer all bullets, cannons, aircraft equipment and warships in complete condition to the Allied forces, and ensure that there is no further damage to transportation facilities. (4) All Vichy troops can choose to declare their support for General de Gaulle or to disband. If they are willing to stay, they will be incorporated by the Free French Army. (5) The conditions for officers are the same as above. Those who are willing to stay will be assigned positions according to their rank. (6) All civil servants who are willing to stay will be allowed to stay and continue in their original positions. (7) No personnel of the Vichy civil administration or army will be prosecuted. (8) Syria will be part of the sterling bloc. (9) All German and Italian representatives will be handed over to Britain (according to the Italian armistice commission, it has left Syria on Thursday). (10) All warships will remain in the port and will be kept by the British. General Wilson's letter, similar to the letter to the city of Boston during the American Revolution, was issued after British Prime Minister Churchill's statement in the House of Commons. Churchill's statement stated that military operations in Syria must continue until an armistice agreement is signed. Wilson also said that the Allied forces have now broken through the outer defense line of Beirut and hope to avoid the loss of civilian property and lives. According to a Reuters dispatch, several plumes of black smoke were found east of Beirut, believed to be from burning oil depots. The Vichy army was burning all its materials before retreating. According to news from Ankara, when Marshal Pétain's special envoy, Méchin, visited Ankara, an unnamed French person first proposed an armistice in Syria. The French person contacted the British ambassador and asked London to put forward conditions. The British Embassy sent the proposal to London to formulate the details of the armistice agreement. The final conditions were forwarded by the U.S. Consul in Beirut. The signs of peace in Syria have made Turkey very happy, because after the Allied forces occupy Syria, the sea route between Egypt and Turkey will be guaranteed, and the land route through Iran will also be guaranteed. In the event that a third country makes unacceptable demands, Turkey's position will be greatly enhanced because its ally, Britain, is now adjacent to it and can send reinforcements immediately. Therefore, the recent developments in the Middle East contain political importance that is no less than military importance. Last night, the Paris radio station, controlled by the Germans, announced that the Vichy government is now studying the conditions for an armistice in Syria and will notify General Darlan, who is currently in Paris, of the conditions by telephone. At the same time, it is reported that the British army continued to occupy Raqqa and Qamashli on the Euphrates River. The Allied forces have now apparently controlled a large area in northeastern Syria and surrounded Aleppo. According to official announcements, the Allied forces captured thousands of Vichy troops and seventeen cannons, three tanks, and five armored vehicles when they occupied Damour.

Havas, Vichy, 9th. Official sources here have recently confirmed that the military authorities of the British and French countries in Syria have proposed truce conditions, and they have been passed to this place. The French government is now considering them. Admiral Darlan, the Assistant Secretary of the Cabinet, is in Paris and has been notified by long-distance telephone. Responsible persons here are silent about the content of the truce conditions and refuse to comment, only saying that our country has determined a certain limit. If this limit is exceeded, any truce proposal will not be accepted, and if this negotiation cannot achieve satisfactory results, the war will continue.

### 蘇堅據衝要陣地　戰爭入第二階段　德佔塞拉及奧斯特洛夫蘇稱消滅德摩托軍一師

Reuters, London, 10th. Judging from the latest news received in London, the continued resistance of the Soviet army seems to have slowed down the Nazi blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union. The Soviet side announced that the Soviet army is counterattacking in many areas, which is very beneficial. The Berlin side said that the German side is now most concerned not with occupying land, but with annihilating the enemy. However, other news from the German side and Berlin dispatches from neutral newspapers all indicate that the German side is quite disappointed with the lack of progress of the army. The German side recently claimed to have occupied Sera, part of the Finnish waist-shaped area (ceded to the Soviet Union last year), the Delmari coast of Estonia, and Kronstadt on the Leningrad Avenue from Latvia. The Soviet side's recent communique revealed that the Soviet army has successfully counterattacked in many areas and gained the initiative. Berlin's German officials said that the war has now entered the second decisive stage, and the Soviet army has firmly occupied more important positions, which the German army is trying to encircle.

Havas Agency, a certain border area of the Soviet Union, 9th. Eighteen days have passed since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. The Red Army's resistance has not been crushed. Although the German army's advance has been slow, it has not been completely blocked. The German army advancing towards Leningrad has made some progress. Its vanguard invading Estonia has crossed the city of Ostrov. However, the General Command of the Red Army has ordered a general counterattack. The Red Army launched a large-scale counterattack on the Berezina River to prevent the German army from advancing towards Moscow and Kiev.

Havas Agency, Moscow, 10th. The Information Department issued a battle report this morning stating that there were fierce battles on all fronts last night. All enemy attacks were repelled. A motorized division of the enemy in the Libel area was completely annihilated. Our army also captured 40 of its cannons and a large number of transport vehicles. A division of the enemy in the Borisov area was also severely damaged and retreated. In Bessarabia, the enemy's offensive has been contained by our army. There have been only local conflicts on the Finnish front. As for the air force, our side shot down 34 enemy aircraft in the past 24 hours, and our aircraft lost only 5.

Tass, Moscow, 10th. The Soviet Information Bureau released the battle situation on the 9th as follows: "On the 9th, enemy tanks attempted to break into Ostrov, Prouzyki, and Novgorod-Volynsk. Our army is continuing to fight fiercely in these areas. In Ostrov, our army is doing its best to prevent the advance of a large number of enemies. In Prouzyki, the enemy launched a new offensive in the morning. Our army inflicted heavy damage on the enemy with fierce artillery and resolute counterattacks. The battle is continuing. In the Libel area, our army's counterattack was very successful. In the Novgorod-Volynsk area, our army engaged in fierce battles with large enemy motorcycle and mechanized units all day long. In other areas, our army is firmly defending its positions."

United Press, Moscow, 10th. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky said yesterday that Hitler's army drove 10,000 tanks to fight against the Soviet Red Army, and also said that Hitler thought he could repeat the story of the great war against France, but "he encountered an enemy with equal equipment for the first time."

### 北路戰况

Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 10th. The Finnish military headquarters announced yesterday that the German army is advancing from the northwest of Serra, and the Finnish army advancing from the south has invaded Soviet territory by ten kilometers. In order to avoid being trapped, the Soviet army retreated to the city of Kandalaksha. The Finnish army is advancing along a 300-kilometer front south of Paanajärvi. The Finnish army has now reached Pietsamo, Kostovo, and Krimoshiyärvi. At one point, the Finnish army has invaded Soviet territory by 60 kilometers.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 10th. The German army announced in a battle report this afternoon that the German army fighting on the Finnish front has occupied the city of Serra, which was ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union in 1940. The Soviet army has built an important fortress there.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 10th. Authoritative authorities said yesterday that the city of Pärnu and Viljandi in Estonia and the city of Ostrov in the Soviet Union have been occupied by the German army. The Soviet army's attempt to resist on the new defense line along the Soviet border has failed. The German army has defeated the Soviet army and invaded Estonia.

Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 10th. When Soviet aircraft attacked Helsinki yesterday morning, 14 people were killed and 93 injured, and 18 houses and 3 schools were destroyed. At that time, 6 Soviet aircraft dropped 50 fragmentation bombs and some incendiary bombs. While rescue work was still in progress, the first alarm sounded again.

Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 10th. It was officially announced here that the results of the second large-scale Soviet air raid on Helsinki on Wednesday resulted in 17 deaths and 156 injuries, including 73 serious injuries.

### 完善蘇軍二百餘萬加入中心地帶作戰

United Press, London, 10th. The impression prevalent here today is that the Soviet-German war will be decided within two or three weeks, and it can be determined whether it will be a long-term war or a short-term war. A qualified commentator said that the goals set by the original German plan have not been even half achieved. It is reported that the Soviet Union's mobilization has now been practically completed. It is estimated that there are about 2 million to 3 million Soviet troops with complete equipment who have joined the fighting in the Smolensk and Moscow areas, which are considered to be the center of the entire war. Military experts say that if the German army reaches Kiev in a week or two, there is nothing strange, but they strongly say that this kind of progress is not important unless this move is a turning point for a large-scale German southward attack to attack the wheat fields of Ukraine and the oil and manganese-producing areas of the Caucasus. Military experts say that the German army cannot decisively strike Ukraine and the Caucasus unless the German army also reaches Moscow to protect its left wing in Ukraine in order to resist the powerful Soviet army. Responsible Turkish sources here said that as long as the Soviet army maintains its front line, Turkey is even more unwilling to allow the German army or military supplies to pass through Turkey to attack the Caucasus region to the north.

Reuters, Stockholm, 10th. A newspaper here published an article discussing the Soviet-German war, saying that the main factor today is the strength of the Soviet Union's internal front line. Stalin's ability to unite the Soviet people is greater than that of Tsar Nicholas II, and internal resistance is also stronger than before. The Soviet people are now defending their own land. Germany previously said that it could occupy Moscow in three weeks, but now it is feared that it will be delayed until at least March. However, even if the German army occupies the city, it will still not be able to defeat the Soviet Union. Now, Britain is attacking more and more fiercely, and the United States has moved its outposts closer to Europe. Therefore, occupying a place as large as the Soviet Union in the winter will be a crazy job. If Germany's momentum deteriorates day by day, the positions of several countries will also gradually change. For example, Romania tried to chase away its King Carol, the Prime Minister of Hungary tried to commit suicide, and Finland has joined the powerful country that is oppressing Norway and Denmark. The future will show whether they have taken the best path. This war will not be enough to determine the victory or defeat. Germany must not suffer major losses, and defeating the Soviet Union can be said to be a victory. If the losses are too heavy, then even if it wins, it will still lose. Two hundred million Soviet people have the power and perseverance of primitive people, and it is impossible to slaughter them.

### 蘇聯發表波海戰情德驅逐艦兩艘擊沉

Reuters, Moscow, 10th. The details of the Baltic Sea battle on Monday have been released. It is said that the battle took place in the Irbe Strait, located at the entrance of the Gulf of Riga between the island of Saaremaa and the coast of Latvia. At that time, two German destroyers were escorting an auxiliary cruiser and were trying to enter the Gulf. A German destroyer was quickly hit by Soviet shells and sank. The remaining two ships released smoke screens to escape, but another destroyer was eventually hit by bombs dropped by Soviet naval aircraft and sank to the bottom of the sea with its crew. The displacement of the two destroyers was 800 to 1,000 tons. In addition, the three most elite battalions of the Romanian army, the Royal Guards, mistakenly believed that the Soviets had returned Bessarabia to Romania and rashly crossed the border into Bessarabia. They were bombarded by Soviet artillery and machine gun fire, resulting in the annihilation of all two battalions and most of the third battalion. The rest were captured.

Tass, Moscow, 10th. A bombing detachment of the Black Sea Fleet, commanded by Captain Gutorschemiye, hit two ships with one bomb during an attack on enemy ships, and crew member Gobertov also hit one ship.

### U.S. Navy Secretary Knox Declares: Roosevelt Gives Instructions Personally; Further Protection of Iceland Shipping Lanes; German Warships Will Be Fired Upon If They Interfere

Reuters, Washington, 10th – U.S. Navy Secretary Knox stated last night that President Roosevelt has personally given instructions to the Navy Department, informing them of the actions to be taken when it is necessary to open fire to protect the vital Atlantic route to American bases from enemy activities.

United Press, Washington, 10th – Navy Secretary Knox declared that President Roosevelt's continued orders regarding the U.S. military occupation of Iceland were "a step further" than the previous instructions to only report the combat operations of foreign ships in the Western Hemisphere. According to previous orders, U.S. warships were only required to send reports to the White House in "plain English" whenever they encountered enemy ships. Several parties believe that these new orders indicate that the Navy has received instructions to protect the convoy actions to Iceland. When asked where the idea of occupying Iceland originated, Secretary Knox replied that he believed it originated from the United States as part of its national defense program. When asked if the Navy Department intends to protect the Western Hemisphere from enemy approach, Knox said, "Hitler would be happy to obtain this position." He did not comment on British Prime Minister Churchill's mention of Anglo-American naval cooperation.

British Prime Minister Protests Wheeler's Remarks

United Press, Washington, 10th – The White House announced that British Prime Minister Churchill has protested to the U.S. government regarding Senator Wheeler's (an isolationist from Montana) disclosure of British troop movements, saying that this matter is extremely likely to endanger the lives of British soldiers. Wheeler had previously predicted that American troops would go to Iceland to replace British troops.

Reuters, Washington, 10th – Presidential Secretary Early told reporters yesterday that the State Department had received a telegram from British Prime Minister Churchill to the President, stating that the British government expressed concern about the remarks made on July 3 regarding the military deployment to Iceland, as such remarks could endanger lives. On July 3, isolationist Senator Wheeler told reporters that he had heard that U.S. troops would occupy Iceland. Therefore, although the British Prime Minister's message did not mention Wheeler's name, it was in response to Wheeler's remarks. The reference to endangering lives referred to the lives of British personnel. When reporters asked if this telegram would be sent to Congress, Early replied that he was only officially releasing this information to the press, and he thought Congress would know about it soon.

Senator Wheeler Provokes the President

United Press, Washington, 10th – Montana's famous isolationist Democratic Senator Wheeler challenged the President yesterday, asking if he dared to declare war on Germany. Wheeler said that if Congress granted his request, he would fully support America's war efforts. This remark was in response to the White House's previous accusation that he was undermining self-defense efforts. Wheeler said, "Roosevelt does not want Congress because he knows he will not obtain permission to declare war from Congress. Instead of dragging us gradually into the European war through the back door, why doesn't the President directly ask Congress to declare war? This is an honest approach and can obtain the unity of the people."

United Press, Washington, 10th – Republican Congressman Osmers of New Jersey told the House yesterday that he would not be surprised if the United States, due to the occupation of Iceland, were to have an "armed conflict" with Germany in the coming weeks. He believes that President Roosevelt's order to open the sea to Iceland means that the Navy can fire on German warships if they attempt to interfere with American shipping to Iceland. Republican Congressman Hoffman of Michigan suggested to the House that this suggestion would require the permission of the entire nation before forcing the United States to send an expeditionary force to land in a foreign country.

Willkie Advocates for American Escorts

Reuters, Washington, 10th – Former Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie advocated that the United States should establish military bases in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Willkie told reporters after President Roosevelt's reception of reporters yesterday that giving Britain verbal support is of no use. We should give them effective assistance, or it would be better not to give any assistance at all. I advocate that the United States should establish military bases in Northern Ireland and Scotland. In my opinion, the U.S. troop deployment to Iceland is the first step in the same action that should be taken. Willkie also replied to reporters' questions, saying that keeping the sea lanes open is extremely important, and the losses of British ships now far exceed the number of new tons being built.

German Officials Have Not Yet Expressed Any Opinion

Reuters, Sulerke, 10th – German officials have remained silent on the U.S. occupation of Iceland. However, people in Berlin regard it as extremely important, believing it to be the first ominous sign that the United States can present to the world as a fait accompli. The newspapers condemned the U.S. President under headlines such as "Roosevelt's Challenge" and "Unprecedented Aggression," claiming that Germany has no ill intentions towards the United States and Iceland, and that the U.S. military occupation of Iceland can relieve Britain of the task of protecting the transportation of war materials. The U.S. President's action is a direct challenge to European powers.

### U.S. Red Cross President Mourns Missing Nurses

Reuters, Washington, 10th – According to yesterday's announcement, a British ship carrying American nurses to England was sunk by a torpedo, resulting in the disappearance of six American nurses. U.S. Red Cross President Davis issued a statement saying that the U.S. Red Cross must announce with deep sorrow that six American women who went to England to carry out extremely important charitable work were subjected to such barbaric treatment. These six nurses and Mrs. Blackinridge, who was not a nurse but wished to serve the Red Cross, all voluntarily went overseas to perform humanitarian work, and have now become the latest victims of maritime aggression, which is truly tragic. We Americans will certainly be proud of these women who risked their lives in their duties.

### U.S. Warns Germany and Italy Against Detaining American Nationals

Reuters, Washington, 10th – According to responsible sources, the U.S. State Department has clearly warned Germany and Italy that if all American nationals being held as hostages are not currently issued exit visas, then German and Italian nationals in the United States will not be allowed to leave. The government wants to see immediate action. According to recent registration, there are 66,000 Italian nationals and 330,000 German nationals residing in the United States, while there are only several thousand American nationals traveling in Europe.

### International Wheat Conference to Discuss Surplus Wheat Issues

Reuters, Washington, 10th – Undersecretary of State Welles said that representatives from Britain, the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Australia will attend the international conference convened today to discuss the world's surplus wheat problem. The representatives will consider a proposal for an international agreement so that countries with surplus wheat can allocate export markets.

### A Special Air Route Opened Between the United Kingdom and the United States

United Press, Washington, 10th – Yesterday, this area had news that the Department of the Army has started a direct official airline between Washington and Britain, the purpose of which is to speed up official traffic. This kind of airline only carries official documents and officials. Knowledgeable sources said that it will dispatch four-engine, 26-ton bombers stripped of armaments.

### A Quick Sketch of Figures at the National Financial Conference

— Ba Yu

The National Financial Conference opened in Chongqing on the 15th of last month, and all the resolutions have been published in the telegrams. Now, let's record the anecdotes of the conference period to aid conversation.

Mr. Fox, an American, is Very Scholarly

When the third plenary session was held on the afternoon of the 18th, Mr. Fox, an American member of the Equalization Fund Committee, was invited to attend and give a speech. Mr. Fox was wearing a gray suit, eyeglasses, and had a very scholarly appearance. Mr. Coolidge and Mr. Taylor were also with Mr. Fox at the meeting. Mr. Fox held more than ten pages of speech manuscript and spoke in a heavy tone, which lasted for 30 minutes. The main idea of his speech was that this financial conference would usher in a new era in China's financial policy. The important issue at present is how to modernize the economic and financial institutions, and he mentioned the United States' quasi-wartime tax policy. This is a feature of the participation of foreign nationals in the financial conference.

The Slogans of Xia, Yin, and Zhou Were Actually All One-Tenth

In the middle of the meeting place, there were rather unique white cloth slogans, such as "The Xiahou clan contributed 50, the Yin people helped 70, and the Zhou people gave 100 acres, but in fact, they were all one-tenth." This kind of slogan is rare, and it seems to give inspiration to the speakers. As for those who spoke the most during the conference, it was definitely Mr. Wei Tingsheng and Mr. Chen Changheng, who can be regarded as two devoted sworn brothers who knew everything and said everything.

The Names of the Members of the Congress Were Made into Clever Couplets

A certain financial expert, who was very knowledgeable in Chinese studies, had made the names of the members into couplets, which were ingeniously crafted and full of humor. I will select a few to amuse the readers.

(1) He Beiheng, Luo Beichen, all the mountains face north.

Liu Zhendong, Li Zhendong, wind and rain come from the east.

(2) Liu Butong, Zheng Yitong, different choices and goals.

Chuan Jianbai, Xia Jianbai, the same philosophy.

(3) Tian Xi, Jin Guobao

Lei Zhen, Tian Yushi

(Note) The wonderful thing about this couplet is: Tian Xi is Jin Tianxi, whose surname is included in the surname Jin Guobao; secondly, the character Lei contains Yu Tian; thirdly, the wonderful thing is especially in the characters "Xi" and "Zhen" of the verb.

(4) 199, 212, clearly two seats.

204, 241, seem like one person.

(Note) 199 and 212 are the seat numbers of member Hu Mai, which are repeated. 204 is Liu Butong's seat number, and 241 is Liu Yi's (representative of Xiang Province) seat number. "Yi" is also "Butong".

(5) One, Yang Can San, Zhu Tong Jiu,

Two, Chen Guoliang, Feng Tianzhu,

Three, Chen Baoyin, Mao Longzhang,

Four, He Lian, Hu Mai.

Mortar-Style Speeches, a Chorus of Southern and Northern Accents

During the discussions at the conference, members scrambled to speak, with different southern and northern accents and varying dialects. Some people spoke in voices that were too low, and even if you listened intently, it was still difficult to understand. Someone invented a lightning-style of speaking, that is, first calling the chairman, then reporting the number, and then immediately speaking like a mortar. At this time, others would not compete because you had already spoken. However, special attention should be paid to the surprise attack of speaking, otherwise it would be easy for others to take the lead. Therefore, the chairman often adopted a quick-knife-cutting-through-chaos approach during discussions, and quickly put things to a vote. Once, after a motion had been passed, Wei Tingsheng stood up to speak. The chairman said that it had already been passed. Wei said that he only wanted to modify one word, but in the end, because it was finalized, it could not be revised again. In order to divide the financial revenue and expenditure system, Kong Xiangxi said that this was aimed at adjusting the uneven distribution of wealth among the provinces, so as to balance the development of construction undertakings in the provinces. He gave an example: There is a state in the United States that is very poor, so it has established particularly broad divorce laws and collects divorce fees. All Americans who want to divorce go to that state, and divorce fees are a major source of income for the state. Minister Kong added a sentence: Isn't this a joke?

A Gathering of Members of All Ages, a Grand Banquet on the Banks of the Jialing River

According to statistics, members aged 35 to 45 accounted for 60%, those aged 45 to 50 accounted for 20%, and those over 50 and those aged 30 to 35 accounted for 20%. In terms of clothing, suits and Zhongshan suits were roughly equal in popularity, and those wearing long gowns accounted for less than one-tenth. The earliest to arrive at the meeting were Guan Jiyu in a truck, Huang Zhu, who wore "Soviet planned economy" attire, and Chen Qicai, etc. Zhou Jichun, the Director of Finance of Shaanxi Province, was plainly dressed and attracted much attention. Regarding the method of eating, thrifty members mostly ate at the meeting place, of course, except for being invited to banquets. During the conference, there were also tea, snacks, soda, and orange juice, all placed in baskets, and you could take them yourself if you wanted to eat. On the evening of the 18th, the Deputy Minister of Finance, etc., hosted a banquet for all members at the Jialing Hotel, and then a long line of cars unfolded. People were sweating, cars were roaring, and rushing to the banks of the Jialing River. I think holding a meeting and inviting to a banquet is time-consuming and expensive, and according to the usual practice, it is quite uneconomical. It would be great to bravely eliminate this bad habit!

Deng Xihou Talks About Suppressing Bandits: He Cannot Finish Suppressing Until Old Age

The old General Deng Xihou also went to the meeting place to give a speech. When he talked about the problem of suppressing bandits, he said that the bandits in Sichuan were like "wildfires that cannot be exhausted, and the spring breeze blows again." He himself started suppressing them from when he enlisted in the army, and has not finished suppressing them until now. He said that he cannot finish suppressing until old age. He advocated that the method of suppressing bandits should start with education, which is a sharp and insightful view.

Havas, Moscow, 10th – It is rumored that the Soviet Union and the United States are negotiating to lease Kamchatka and the Primorsky Krai to the United States. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky recently issued a widespread message on Moscow Radio, denying this and saying that the role of those who created this rumor is to make Japan feel uneasy, thereby joining the German-Soviet war.

### Stalin Line Is Impregnable; Depth Reaches 20 Miles, Defended by Elite Red Army

Havas, Rome, 9th – The Evening Mail recently commented on the German-Soviet war, "briefly stating that today, the Soviet Red Army is fighting bravely, no different from the Tsarist Russian army in the past. The Stalin Line is impregnable, its depth reaching 20 miles. Not only that, the Red Army Commander-in-Chief ordered the construction of new fortifications between the artillery positions of the Stalin Line two weeks ago to strengthen it. According to German officers, the Red Army guarding the Stalin Line are all elite troops of the Red Army, fully equipped, well-trained, strong, and good at fighting.

### It Is Reported That Soviet Troops Have Recaptured Lviv; The Center of Romanian Oil Fields Has Been Completely Destroyed

United Press, Stockholm, 10th – Yesterday, a Soviet radio station heard here said that Soviet troops had recaptured Lviv in Poland, which was occupied by German troops in the early stages of the Soviet-German war.

United Press, New York, 10th – The official Moscow radio station broadcast last night that the Soviet Air Force had "completely destroyed" the enemy's oil field center in Romania, especially near Ploiești. It also said that as a result of the Soviet Air Force's fierce bombing, the Romanian port of Constanța on the Black Sea "no longer exists".

TASS, Moscow, 10th – Our Air Force fiercely bombed Constanța seaport, transport ships of the Turkish-Syrian line, and the Polushti oil area. When bombing Constanța, nine of our bombers were attacked by fourteen enemy aircraft. Our Air Force immediately counterattacked, and seven enemy aircraft were shot down. We also lost one aircraft.

### Moscow Completes Fire Organization; Lookout Teams Also Formed

Reuters, Moscow, 10th – Moscow citizens engaged in fire prevention organizations completed yesterday. Lookout teams and fire brigades have been formed, and the tops of houses have been cleared to facilitate fire prevention. Women have been sewing sandbags and giving support to firefighters for many days. Yesterday, on the sunny streets, citizens wearing early summer clothes were bustling back and forth, buying fire prevention supplies. The fire brigades organized by factories, offices, and apartments had to be completed by 10 o'clock last night. Most of the team members are men aged 16 to 55. From midnight yesterday, they will be on lookout on the roofs day and night. Those who violate this will be severely punished. The Permanent Bureau issued a new regulation yesterday regarding private letters and telegrams. Letters must not exceed four sheets of paper, and no military, political, or economic information that helps the enemy is allowed to be sent overseas. All letters must be personally delivered to the post office for mailing. All crossword puzzles, chess scores, and photographic postcards are prohibited from mailing. Moscow newspapers carried news from Tallinn (the capital of Estonia) and Vyborg, saying that people in Estonia have organized civil defense teams, and farmers have also formed enemy aircraft lookout teams.

### British Flying Fortresses Are Ready to Go; The First Batch of Twenty Are Being Assembled; "Liberator" Aircraft Will Also Be in Combat

Reuters, London, 10th – The latest type of British Air Force heavy bombers are now said to be ready to go. These new aircraft are slightly modified versions of the original American Boeing Flying Fortresses. A reporter from a news agency recently inspected several of these large aircraft at the Air Ministry's aircraft assembly site. The site is currently assembling the first batch of twenty for immediate use. According to the opinions of experienced pilots at the site, this batch of new aircraft will be the most elite of the bomber command, as these Flying Fortresses are like large ships without any defects. There is also a large aircraft called the Liberator, which is also said to be ready for combat. Like the Flying Fortress, it can carry heavy bombs and fly long distances at an altitude of several miles above the ground.

Havas, New York, 10th – British fighter planes and light bombers built in the United States are now planning to fly directly from the United States to Britain, stopping along the way in Newfoundland, Greenland, and Iceland. It is also planned to install special gasoline tanks on these aircraft to increase their capacity, so that they can fly from the United States to Britain in one go.

### British Aircraft Fiercely Attack Targets in Germany

Reuters, London, 10th – It is heard that British bombers, protected by fighter planes, penetrated deep into the German coastal occupied areas yesterday afternoon and launched a fierce attack, destroying a total of thirteen enemy aircraft. Eight British aircraft are missing. British naval observers saw British aircraft flying out towards France, and not long after, they heard the sound of anti-aircraft guns in the distance. An Air Ministry bulletin said that British aircraft bombed a power plant near Piden in France and a synthetic oil plant near Leipzig in central Germany. The bombs hit their targets.

### European War Talks (6) (7): The Diamond War Between England and Germany

From the very beginning of the outbreak of this European war, England attempted to cut off Germany's supply of diamonds. Any buyer even slightly suspected of aiding the enemy was forbidden from viewing the goods. Several shipments of diamonds transported from German-occupied territories were intercepted by the British Navy. Currently, German military industries have not been affected in any way, because Germany had planned ahead before the outbreak of hostilities and stockpiled a large quantity of diamonds. But Hitler's anxiety is now impossible to conceal. After the German army invaded Poland, German agents flocked to the diamond-producing regions of Brazil, beyond the reach of British power, willing to pay two or three times the normal price to buy industrial diamonds. Unfortunately, Brazil's diamond production accounts for only 3% of the world's total. Even if Germany could buy it all, it would be of no avail, especially since the majority of Brazil's diamonds ultimately end up in the United States.

In May 1940, the German army invaded Holland and Belgium, and began to plunder diamonds, which was a manifestation of Hitler's utter desperation. The German political police and the army arrived simultaneously, heading straight for the diamond trade centers of Antwerp and Amsterdam. Most of these diamond merchants were Jewish, and in their panic, they exhausted every means to hide all polished and rough diamonds, and fled to France.

Those who failed to escape fell into the hands of the political police and were ordered to surrender their diamonds. Some who fled to the villages were betrayed to the German political police by plainclothes agents, and all their diamonds were "confiscated". Many who fled to France thought they could rest easy behind the Maginot Line, but unexpectedly, a month later, France collapsed and they were also pursued by the German political police. There are still dozens of people remaining in Portugal, waiting for an opportunity to go to England and the United States. A small number remain in Spain and the free zone of France, and it is unlikely that they will be able to leave the country.

There are no precise statistics on the number of diamonds Hitler seized in Holland and Belgium, but according to people in the diamond industry, the quantity is quite considerable. But this kind of benefit is only temporary. According to news from Germany, Hitler is about to appeal to German women to contribute diamonds for national defense industries, as was done in the previous European war. At present, small quantities of diamonds are still being transported from Brazil to Germany by Italian planes. The Soviet Union recently announced gleefully that diamonds had been discovered in the Ural region, but most experts do not believe there will be any large-scale discoveries.

At the same time, England is currently trying to supply the US arsenals of the Allied nations with large quantities of industrial diamonds. Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, chairman of the De Beers company, secretly visited the United States in 1940 and stayed overnight at the White House in Washington. The confidant of the aforementioned knight, Dickinson, also specifically went to Johannesburg, South Africa in February of this year and spent a night at the Governor's Mansion. The outside world knows little beyond this.

The quantity of industrial diamonds imported by the United States has broken all records due to the needs of the national defense program and aid to British industries. In 1940, the United States imported 3,801,834 carats of diamonds, worth $10,885,664. This is an increase of 150% compared to the average annual import volume before the war. In January 1941, the American demand was strong in the London diamond market, and the total import volume of the United States for the whole year will increase even more.

The greatest use of diamonds is to drill holes in precision machinery for manufacturing various military equipment. These machines are essential for manufacturing gun barrels, connecting rods, pistons, valves, tanks, aircraft and submarines. Diamond dies are mostly used in landmines, submarine mines, aircraft control instruments, detectors, and radio components. Diamond grit is used in bomber sights, cameras, and telescope lenses. Machines equipped with diamond drill bits are everywhere in the various departments of national defense industry. Since the function of diamonds is so vast, it is no wonder that England and Germany are doing their best to compete for them. (End)

### US Suggests Demilitarized Zone to Peru and Ecuador Both Countries Withdraw Troops 15 Kilometers and Aircraft Cannot Fly Over

Reuters, Washington, 10th The United States, Argentina, and Brazil have asked Peru and Ecuador to establish a demilitarized zone on both sides of their disputed border. Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that after the representatives of the three countries made this suggestion to Peru and Ecuador, the three governments telegraphed other American republics, asking for their assistance to end this dispute.

### Food: Southward Movement Difficult to Achieve Rice Weevils Frustrate Efforts Shanghai Rice Problem Attracts Attention of British Parliament

Yesterday, the foreign rice market turned downward, making implementation impossible for the time being. The market atmosphere dissipated invisibly, and the exchange rate also reportedly lengthened, causing people to feel exhausted. General floating speculators found it difficult to operate again, reversing their previous attitude, and sought to sell off cheaply. Although the Municipal Council's Hong Kong rice had increased in price, the price of 135.05 yuan was still 20 yuan cheaper than the market price of 155 yuan for small bag rice, and they were willing to sell as much as possible. Nearly 30,000 bags were sold in half a day yesterday, and the recycling of small bag spot immediately dropped to 151 yuan. Futures for Siamese No. 2 also dropped to 145 yuan, two or three yuan lower than the previous day. Seventh-month broken rice at 113.5 yuan also fell by two or three yuan. Spot prices consistently moved downward, decreasing by one to three yuan. As there were no regular customers inquiring and hoarders were also watching, the volume of transactions was less than 7,000 bags. The Yinghua Company sold less than 600 tons. The fact that the price of rice in Shanghai has risen by 700% has attracted the attention of the British Parliament, indicating the magnitude of the impact. Therefore, it is expected that the Municipal Council will be able to take further steps to maintain the food supply in Shanghai in the future.

The Municipal Council's affordable foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, 7,756 bags of Municipal Council foreign rice shipped from Hanyang, transported by the Taikoo Company from Hong Kong, were unloaded at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession.

Thick and thin Japonica rice continued to become more active as shipments increased and as foreign rice weakened, people's morale remained low. Local shops’ appetite was weak, and owners were even more willing to sell, so the market continued to have difficulty maintaining its price and fell by one to three yuan. Early and late Indica rice from Kainam Port opened at 143.5 yuan, then dropped to 141 yuan. High-quality old crop Indica rice from Wuxi in the original packaging sold for 34 yuan.

Hong Kong glutinous rice remained mediocre, as Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened high at 125-126 yuan, then dropped to 122 yuan. Local glutinous rice was 115 yuan. As shipments of domestic glutinous rice were intermittent, owners’ minds were more firm, and as market prices had reached parity with foreign yuan, there was some scattered demand. Therefore, the market was relatively firm, with ordinary goods still requiring 128 to 126 yuan.

### Flour Price Drops by Half a Yuan

Flour: Yesterday, the spot foreign flour market trended towards weakness again. As sales had been active for days, regular customers' appetite gradually became satiated, and coupled with the weakening exchange rate and the decline in the rice market, people's morale suddenly softened. Speculative hoarders stopped buying and started selling. Golden Dragon flour opened at 33 yuan, then quickly fell to 32.9 yuan. Fort flour initially opened at 33.7 yuan, and Five Swallow Brand opened at 33 yuan, each falling by about half a yuan. Most other miscellaneous brands were directly matched to customers, and prices were reduced by three to five jiao each. The market situation returned to a flat trajectory.

Wheat: Yesterday, wheat trading remained quiet, as the production price of new wheat was high and subject to strict controls. Therefore, operators were unable to do anything. It was said that a Japanese factory had previously dumped goods, but apart from two small batches that arrived, it has not been possible to circulate them smoothly to this day. The market remains stagnant as before.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Shows Signs of Loosening, Absorbed by HSBC and Then Returns

At noon, HSBC absorbed the supply, preventing the loosening trend, so it stabilized. In the afternoon, a small number of speculators liquidated their positions, then stopped.

### Securities: Public Bonds Difficult to Encourage for the Time Being, But Foreign Bonds Show Promise

Public Bonds: The black market price yesterday fell again. The rebound of the day before had no ability to continue, and the lower levels also saw lower prices, with a downward trend. Many parties were liquidating, and even new long positions showed signs of being unable to hold on, but several old bulls were still persisting and had not yet shown any cracks. If the old longs liquidated again, the 70 yuan level for Class C bonds would be difficult to maintain. Rumors did not stop, ultimately making it difficult for a rebound to occur. Yesterday morning, Hengkang bought in, but then liquidated in the afternoon. Retailers bought in, but then sold out in the afternoon. Tongsheng Hengtai bought in and did not sell out. Hongda's selling pressure was strong, and Xiekang and Jiufeng also sold in unison. Xinhua and Yichang also sold off at any time. The noon closing price for Class C bonds broke 1 yuan again.

### Yarn and Cotton: Short Positions Adequately Control the Yarn Market High Prices Expected to Decline But It is Not Known If They Can Succeed

The yarn market reacted and fell, but actual sales remained good. However, Hong Kong merchants bought mostly 10-count coarse yarn. People's mood was mediocre, and short positions were very active, pressing down on the market. However, those with strong capital continued to absorb supply and were interested in increasing their positions if prices were right, because of the cost factor related to the raw material. Thus, the long and short sides reached a time of intense contention. 20-count Double Horse high price was 1,618 yuan, and the low price was 1,582 yuan. The afternoon opening atmosphere was still good, and the price was 1,596 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain firm that had sold off on the previous day sold another 100 bales, immediately falling back to 1,590 yuan. However, a group of people revived the idea of going long, saying that cotton prices were not loosening, and sequentially rebounded to 1,600 yuan. The final price was 1,598 yuan.

The opening of Double Horse morning was stable. The first trade was 1,615 yuan. At this time, the trade was stable. Soon, it rose to 1,680 yuan. Afterwards, large short positions dumped heavily, and long positions were liquidated. The market atmosphere weakened, falling to the 1,600 yuan level. However, Guangdong merchants bought 1,200 bales of 10-count Double Horse Special Jincheng and 600 bales of Double Horse outside warehouse, people's mood was still set. Unexpectedly, around 12 o'clock, short positions shouted loudly, and the situation was suddenly weak, immediately falling to 1,582 yuan. However, large firms saw that the price was low and suddenly covered their positions. The statistics for the half-day volume showed 7,620 bales. The quantity bought by each firm is listed below:

Hong Kong: 1,620 bales, Other Firms: 6,000 bales, Total: 7,620

Golden Double Horse Forward Yarn Market Situation: The opening in the morning continued the previous day's weak trend, and the long side was still liquidating. All months were down three to four yuan. Afterwards, due to negative rumors, the long side's selling became more active, and the short side pressured the market, causing prices to open softer. The noon closing saw a drop of 18.5 yuan for July, 12 yuan for August, and 8 yuan for September. 12,940 bales were traded. The latter part of the market was initially flat and then firm. In the end, the July contract was down 12.5 yuan from the previous day, August was down 10 yuan, and September was down 6.5 yuan. A total of 19,220 bales were traded throughout the day, down 1,220 bales from the previous day. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the entire day are recorded below (net trade prices).

### Cotton Prices Remain Firm and High Not Affected by the Yarn Market

The current cotton situation remains stable, with no signs of falling prices. This is because US cotton continues to rise, and local cotton prices have always been several tens of yuan cheaper than foreign cotton prices. Therefore, the yarn market has speculative relationships and fluctuates from time to time, while the cotton market is different. Furthermore, cotton merchants have an elevated attitude, and if prices do not drop, they would rather leave it in warehouses.

The New York cotton market was active and firm, rising due to buying by traders and unfavorable reports on cotton production. As a result, the closing price was about 9-10 points higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to selling by Japanese merchants and rumors that the government would ban the shipment of Indian cotton to Japan. It then rose slightly due to support from buyers. Finally, the market weakened again due to long liquidation and selling by foreign merchants. As a result, the closing price fell by one to seven rupees. The forecast for the opening of the market today is one and a half rupees higher.

Trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was enthusiastic, and the market was firm, because the source of foreign cotton was quite scarce, and at the same time, Shanghai's inventory was not high, and factories needed it urgently. As a result, both Chinese and foreign merchants have been ordering large quantities of Brazilian cotton and Indian cotton in recent days.

### Piece Goods: Factory Cloth Prices Trend Differently

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market was firm. Merchants from Hong Kong, the South Seas, and local warehouses bought actively from dyeing factories. The selling prices for white cloth, coarse cloth, and lightweight cloth rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan per piece, with heavyweight cloth unchanged. Part of the fine cloth and twill cloth rebounded by 0.25 yuan per piece, and the price of gray cloth also rose slightly in most cases.

Qingdao merchants bought over 2,000 pieces of coarse cloth and finished cloth.

The closing price for Four Gentlemen Serge was 1.61 yuan on the stock ticket and 1.58 yuan in the spot market, down 0.075 yuan per yard from the previous day.

### Grains: Soybean Cake and Corn with Slight Domestic Sales

Soybean Cake: At the opening yesterday morning, floating long positions continued to sell, so the market fell by 0.4-0.5 yuan again. Later, due to slight domestic sales and some short position covering, it rebounded slightly. As a result, it closed slightly lower by 0.1-0.2 yuan. 1,000 pieces of Kailu brand soybean cake were sold, and over 6,000 pieces of Shengji brand soybean cake were sold in the spot market, along with around 20,000 pieces in the forward market.

Corn trading was initially slow and then active. The opening market once fell by about one yuan. Later, Ningbo merchants inquired about prices and it rebounded by half a yuan. A total of over 3,000 bags of Saigon and Dutch corn were sold.

### Metals: Pig Lead Still Relatively Firm

The market for Canadian pig lead has been quiet since a certain party stopped trading, and the market situation has declined accordingly. The inventory in Shanghai has no signs of shortage. Although overseas sources have been cut off, merchants' minds are not high. The opening price yesterday was 420 yuan per dan, the market price was on par with that of before, but black market conditions were relatively firm due to 50 dan being thrown into market yesterday.

### Flat Iron Sheets Soar After Being Searched

Among metal products, tinplate and union iron, which have recently been in short supply, had an exceptionally brisk market and soared after being searched. In general, small factories didn't dare take action, but in order to continue business, they had to change to flat iron sheets, which were relatively cheaper, so this product soared after being searched, and the market has also gotten better day by day. It is said that the local factories are eager to absorb them, and the transaction volume is around a hundred or so cases per day. The standard selling price is 540 yuan per case, which is more than 10 yuan higher than before.

### The Different Destinies of Wire Rods and Iron Nails

Wire rods and iron nails are inherently complementary. However, since the closure of overseas sales for locally produced iron nails, their market has declined. Conversely, wire rods have seen an upward trend due to the dwindling overseas supply. Fellow traders have been actively accumulating them. It is reported that yesterday's market saw over 300 tons traded at an asking price of 210 yuan. However, in smaller transactions and retail deals, the price can reach 216-217 yuan per picul. Despite the lively trade and favorable market conditions for wire rods, iron nails face a different situation. Their market remains sluggish, relying solely on local sales, causing prices to hover around 170 yuan with no significant improvement.

### Dried Fruits and Vegetables: Flavored Vegetables Showing Weakness

Flavored vegetables are currently in peak season. Due to previous high prices, supply has been continuous. Consequently, market prices are showing signs of weakening. Yesterday, the market price for flavored vegetables was 85 yuan, with lower quality at 80 yuan. Soy sauce flavored vegetables are tighter in supply, selling for 130 yuan.

### Assorted Round Longans Expected to Rise

Assorted round longans have seen a prolonged disruption in supply. Most of Shanghai's stock is in cold storage, leading to a perceived shortage. Buyers, having been inactive for a while, are eager to purchase, causing prices to firm up. Both suppliers and buyers are holding firm, and the trend is particularly strong. Quoted prices have uniformly increased. A price rise in the future is expected.

### Seafood: Dried Shrimp and Mushrooms Continue to Rise

A new batch of Kobe "East Tail" dried shrimp has arrived. It was released yesterday, and prices have continued to rise to 730 yuan, remaining tight.

Japanese mushrooms that had not been previously offered were sold yesterday at 1,450 yuan, and the trend is still tight. Future quotes are at 1,500 yuan, indicating that the upward trend is not over.

### Miscellaneous: Cigarette Prices Rise Again

The cigarette market saw a sudden surge in buying yesterday, fueled by rumors of positive news. Consumer confidence was boosted, resulting in a significant price increase. "British Brand" cigarettes opened as high as 1,600 yuan, "Old Knife Brand" at 1,130 yuan, "Pin Hai Brand" at 1,110 yuan, "Little Fairy Brand" at 800 yuan, "Five Flowers Brand" at 775 yuan, "Ten Sticks Big Front Gate" at 440 yuan per 10,000, "Golden Rat Brand" medium boxes at 530 yuan, and "Beautiful Brand" medium boxes at 785 yuan. All showed price increases of 20 to 30 yuan compared to previous levels.

### Silk and Tea: Black Tea Sales to the US Suddenly Increase

The tea market saw a slight uptick in overseas sales yesterday. There were reports of US interest in purchasing local black tea. In total, Jin Longhua Tea and Tong Fu companies, among others, bought over 170 cases, with prices ranging from 330 yuan to 380 yuan. Green tea sales, however, remained sluggish. "Treasure Eyebrow" and "Extracted Core" teas saw no inquiries. While merchants sent out telegrams promoting "Shrimp Eye Pearl Tea," there was no response, making prospects for opening up new sales routes bleak.

### Fox Leaves Shanghai for Hong Kong Yesterday to Discuss Foreign Exchange Stabilization Plan, Providing Shanghai Findings as Reference, Aiming to Maintain Legitimate Needs and Prevent Speculation

Mr. Fox, a member of the US Exchange Stabilization Fund, who was commissioned to come to Shanghai to investigate the financial and foreign exchange situation in Shanghai and the occupied areas, arrived here on the 26th of last month via Hong Kong from Chongqing with his assistant Mr. Taylor. For several days, he discussed practical issues such as the black market for foreign exchange with representatives from the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the National Bank of China, as well as representatives from the two foreign banks, HSBC and Citibank, and economic experts staying in Shanghai. Having completed his task, he boarded the British Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Ming Sheng Lun at noon yesterday to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong. He will wait to discuss and study strategies for stabilizing legal foreign exchange and maintaining the black market with Mr. Rogers, the British member of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, Mr. Waichow Chen, Mr. Tehmou Sheng, and Mr. Beisong Sun, who recently arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing. He will then prepare a comprehensive report, providing effective methods to crack down on speculation and prevent arbitrage. Once his official duties in Hong Kong are completed, he will return to Chongqing with the other committee members.

Shanghai's Black Market for Foreign Exchange Will Be Maintained

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday morning that Mr. Fox spent half a month in Shanghai and had frequent discussions with the local financial community, exchanging opinions. Although Mr. Fox himself did not explicitly state the future policies of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, he consistently advocated maintaining the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai. Shanghai is the hub for foreign trade with China and has close ties with the interior. To suppress domestic prices, it is necessary to stabilize the Shanghai foreign exchange market. At the very least, Mr. Fox has prepared a preliminary report based on his talks in Shanghai to be used as reference by other committee members at the meeting in Hong Kong.

Important Meeting to Be Held in Hong Kong

Regarding the Reuters Hong Kong dispatch stating that foreign exchange will be allowed to float and the British pound will be maintained at four pence and one-eighth, the reporter learned from relevant sources that this is likely a rumor and not credible. However, the level at which it will be maintained is a matter of great importance and should not be publicly announced. As for the fact that Mr. Fox will convene a meeting of various Exchange Stabilization Committees in Hong Kong after arriving in Hong Kong, it is understood that the content of the discussion will focus on stabilizing foreign exchange and maintaining the black market under extraordinary circumstances, and will seek the most effective methods to cooperate with various friendly banks to ensure that established policies are fully implemented.

Legitimate Needs Will Not Be Ignored

It is also understood that Mr. Fox has always paid attention to the legitimate needs of legitimate merchants. Banks engaged in foreign exchange should provide foreign exchange to such legitimate businesses as much as possible. Banks such as HSBC have decided to comply. However, those who speculate in foreign exchange, as well as those who conspire to engage in arbitrage, are subject to strict crackdowns, and effective methods will be adopted to prevent them. Measures such as restricting forward foreign exchange transactions and stopping swaps will prevent speculators from employing their tricks and maintain the stability and sustainability of Shanghai's black market for foreign exchange. The currency and financial situation in Shanghai will thus become clearer and more transparent.

### Japanese Cruiser Izumo Returns to Shanghai Yesterday, Repositioned to Yangzi Wharf

The flagship Izumo of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet left Shanghai on the morning of the 26th of last month, heading east from the Wusongkou, its destination unknown. After two weeks, it returned to Shanghai at around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. It docked at the China Merchants Bureau's Yangzi Wharf (i.e., East Wharf) in Pudong across from Yangshupu. The reason for this change in docking location is unknown.

### Soybean and Grain Association Notifies Warehouse Staff to Resume Work Immediately

The warehouse staff of the soybean, rice and grain industry have been on strike for almost a week. In order to resolve the labor dispute as soon as possible, the industry association issued a special notice yesterday. The original text is as follows: "Upon investigation, the labor dispute in the industry's warehouses is mainly due to misunderstandings. The association has repeatedly convened industry meetings, but due to insufficient attendance, a quorum could not be reached, resulting in a stalemate that has lasted for many days. Now, it has been reported by various industry members that their warehouses are willing to resume work immediately. As for the issue of compensation, it will be negotiated directly by each party after work resumes. The association believes this is reasonable. If any industry members express dissent, it will be further investigated. All industry warehouse staff should resume work immediately to avoid further unnecessary disputes. This is hereby notified."

### British House of Commons Concerned About Shanghai Rice and Coal Supply Problem, Conservative Party Asks Eden for Details, Eden Responds That He Knows the Situation Is Serious

London, July 10 (Reuters) - The British House of Commons inquired last night about the shortage of rice and coal in Shanghai. Foreign Secretary Eden replied to a question from Conservative MP Knox that the supply of rice to the poor in the International Settlement was purely a matter for the Shanghai Municipal Council to handle with the Japanese authorities. When asked if he knew that rice prices had risen by 700 percent, Eden replied that he knew the situation was serious. Eden also replied to a question from Conservative MP Milner that the lack of maritime shipping in the Far East had made it difficult for the Shanghai Power Company to maintain its coal reserves. He knew that the company had chartered several neutral ships and was currently negotiating to charter several more.

### German and Italian Women and Children Arrive in Shanghai After Evacuating from the Dutch East Indies, Most Continue to Japan Aboard the Asama Maru, Four Japanese Ships Have Been Requisitioned

The Japanese Mail Steamship Company's Asama Maru was chartered by the German government to carry German and Italian women and children evacuated from Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, to Japan via Manila. It is reported that the ship arrived in Shanghai at 1:30 PM yesterday and anchored at the Waishan Wharf. According to reporters, the number of German and Italian women and children evacuated on board the ship was confirmed to be 420, recently released from concentration camps in the Dutch East Indies. Their husbands have not yet been released. According to a German woman, of these 400 people, 150 are children, and two were born in the concentration camp.

Some Women and Children Disembark in Shanghai

However, according to yesterday's Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, approximately 670 women and children were evacuated, of which 195 decided to disembark in Shanghai, and over 150 planned to disembark in Nagasaki. The rest will go to various places in Yokohama and Kobe. As for the 195 who disembarked in Shanghai, about 70 will stay temporarily with their relatives and friends, and over 120 will travel by land to North China. However, this cannot be confirmed. The ship is scheduled to stay in Shanghai overnight and continue to Japan at 10:00 AM this morning. After sailing to Japan, it will cease operating on the original Pacific route and will be requisitioned by the Japanese government for military transport. In addition, the Mikawa Maru and two Japanese cargo ships that originally sailed to Manila have also been requisitioned. Therefore, including the Asama Maru, four ships have been requisitioned.

Japan's Tendency Is Not Related to This

An authoritative figure from a democratic country in Shanghai stated that the evacuation of German and Italian expatriates from the Dutch East Indies should not be seen as a prelude to Japan's southward advance. It is common knowledge that Japan will not succeed in invading the Dutch East Indies. If Japan blindly launches a southward advance, the strength of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies will be sufficient to cope with it. According to him, Tokyo's intentions are more likely to tend towards a northern invasion, to strike the Soviet Union from the rear. The recent evacuation of Japanese expatriates in North Manchuria and the Japanese government's appointment of the radical Itagaki as Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in Korea are noteworthy. It is said that if Japan does not attack the Soviet Union, it must withdraw from the Axis, because what Hitler wants from Japan is for Japan to provide support when Germany declares war on the Soviet Union. As for encouraging Japan to advance south, it is nothing more than an attempt to restrain the power of the United Kingdom and the United States. This is not Hitler's purpose at this time. British and American expatriates in the Dutch East Indies have long been advised by their respective governments to evacuate back to their home countries to the greatest extent possible, and this is still being done. According to him, it is not necessary to advance the evacuation, and he has not heard of it.

### Rickshaw Rental Increase, Fares Increased, Shanghai Municipal Council Approves

According to a statement released by the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office, the Public Rickshaw Industry Association recently petitioned the Council to increase rickshaw rentals to cope with the sharp increase in car owner expenses. The Council's Police Committee met on the 3rd of this month to discuss the matter. As a result, the Committee believed that the prices of various materials for maintaining the rickshaws had risen sharply, and that rickshaw rentals should be increased to maintain the rickshaws in good condition. It was proposed to increase the maximum rickshaw rental from 1.40 yuan per rickshaw per day to 1.60 yuan, and at the same time increase the minimum fare calculated by distance from 15 cents to 17 cents, and the fare calculated by time from 90 cents to one yuan. This was submitted to the Council's regular board meeting and approved, effective from the 15th of this month.

If rickshaw owners overcharge, they will be severely punished upon discovery. If the rickshaw is found to be dirty or unsatisfactory, the Police Department will withhold its license. The revised rickshaw fares are as follows:

1.  Calculated by Distance

Half a mile 17 cents

Each subsequent half mile or fraction thereof 17 cents

Minimum fare for less than half a mile 17 cents

2.  Calculated by Time

One hour One yuan

Each subsequent half hour or fraction thereof 50 cents

Minimum fare One yuan

### Frequent Gunfire Along the Two Railways, A Flying Dragon Train Derailed in Longtan Yesterday

At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, a Flying Dragon train on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, traveling from Nanjing to Shanghai, reached Longtan when the tracks were blown up by a mine planted under the sleepers by Chinese troops. It is reported that two train cars overturned into the rice paddies, and about one to two hundred passengers were killed or injured. The train guards made efforts to detach the damaged cars and quickly reattach the undamaged cars from the rear and drove to Shanghai, arriving after 3:30 PM, about an hour later than usual. According to passengers arriving in Shanghai from both the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways, since the anniversary of the fourth year of resistance against Japan, Chinese guerrillas have been very active along the lines of the two railways, demolishing rails and laying mines everywhere. There have been several mine explosions, destroying several passenger and freight cars and locomotives. On the 7th, at around 8:00 AM, the tracks were destroyed in several places between Qixia Mountain, Longtan, Xiashu, and Gaozi on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Although the railway bureau repaired them immediately, on the morning of the 8th, a express train near Danyang was hit by a mine explosion, destroying three passenger cars and one locomotive. The losses are unknown. Japanese soldiers are currently searching for guerrillas in nearby villages, and many innocent villagers have been implicated as suspects. Also, on the same morning at around 9:40 AM, a regular passenger train traveling from Shanghai to Nanjing was hit by a mine explosion between Tianfuan and Lujiabang, near Kunshan, destroying one locomotive and several freight cars, including number 51. The tracks were repaired immediately. On the morning of the 7th at around 9:00 AM, a passenger train traveling from Hangzhou to Shanghai on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was hit by a mine planted by Chinese troops between Linping and Xucun. However, the damage was less than on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway.

### French Ambassador Cosme Will Go to Qingdao for Summer,

French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme, after arriving in Shanghai from Beijing, has been working at the French Consulate on the Bund for several days. As summer is approaching, he will leave Shanghai for Qingdao for the summer in the coming days. The Ambassador's wife and two children traveled by ship there recently. Mr. Cosme will stay in Shanghai to handle the French expatriate oath affairs, and will leave as soon as it is completed, returning to Shanghai when the cool autumn breezes arrive.

### Amoy Company's Machinery Transported Southward, Detained at Wusongkou, Guangdong Ship Under Monitoring, Company Is Negotiating, Results Unknown

The British Taikoo Steamship Company's southern route liner Guangdong, with a gross tonnage of 2,626 tons, was originally scheduled to sail to Singapore and Rangoon on the 8th, but was postponed to the 9th. Due to insufficient cargo loading, it only left the port at noon yesterday. At about 2:45 PM, it was stopped from leaving the Wusongkou by a Japanese naval patrol ship and ordered to return. Therefore, it re-entered the port and docked at the Junpu Bureau wharf in Donggou, Pudong, designated by the Japanese Navy, and troops were dispatched to monitor it. It is said that the ship was detained because it was carrying a batch of machinery from the British Amoy Company to Singapore. After receiving a report, the Japanese Navy detained the ship and cargo. The Japanese Navy stated that the ship would be released after the machinery was unloaded.

Upon receiving the report, Taikoo Company and Amoy Company are negotiating with the Japanese side. It is said that although steel is prohibited from export, it was declared and loaded in advance, so there is no reason to detain the ship. It was once rumored that the matter had been resolved through negotiations, but as of yesterday evening, the ship was still docked at the Junpu Bureau wharf in Donggou. The exact situation is still unclear.

### Soviet Union Has Started Inspecting Mail

Following the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the first batch of mail bound for Europe was sealed yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, totaling 150 bags. It will be transported to San Francisco on the President Pierce, then by land to New York, and then by ship across the Atlantic to Europe. It is also understood that the Soviet government has begun inspecting mail. Recently, some of the Soviet mail transported to Shanghai was opened and inspected by the Soviet postal service, and a "Inspected" stamp was affixed to the opening, but without any damage.

### Two More Cases of True Cholera, Totaling Five,

Since the discovery of true cholera in Shanghai, the health of the citizens has been seriously threatened. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, after testing, it was confirmed that Wang Ruqing and two others had true cholera. One of them had already died, and the remaining two are now hospitalized. After good treatment, they will be able to recover and be discharged from the hospital. In addition to these three patients, two more cases of true cholera have recently been discovered, bringing the total to five. It has gradually reached the point of an epidemic. This has caused anxiety and deep concern among the health authorities of the two settlements. In addition, due to the continuous hot weather, the number of patients with seasonal diseases has increased dramatically. According to the daily outpatient records of the Shanghai Seasonal Disease Hospital, there are about 600 patients. It is reported that the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry-sponsored First Aid Seasonal Disease Hospital also opened yesterday at 730 Wenjian Shi Road, admitting patients day and night. The association will also establish a labor seasonal disease hospital in the shortest possible time.

### Belgian Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong, Will Take a Ship to the North, President Pierce Berths Yesterday Afternoon, Sassoon Arrives from America on the Same Ship

Belgian Ambassador to China Mr. Guillaume arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong at around 3:00 PM yesterday on the American President Lines' President Pierce. The Belgian Consul-General in Shanghai Mr. Wang Gesen and senior officials from the embassy went to the dock to welcome him. After landing, the Ambassador went to the Carlton Hotel with the Consul-General and others to rest. It is said that the Ambassador will not stay in Shanghai for long and will take a ship to Qinhuangdao in the next few days and then go to Beidaihe, because his wife and children are vacationing there. It is said that the Ambassador will stay in Beidaihe for a few days to rest, and then return to Beijing.

Sassoon's Remarks on the Current Situation

Mr. Sassoon, a leading figure in Shanghai's financial community, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon on the President Pierce from America. Mr. Sassoon met with reporters in Manila. Sassoon said that if all the democratic nations were to defeat Hitler, they needed to jointly use all resources and weapons. Mr. Sassoon went on to suggest that, in order to overcome the present crisis, the democratic nations should set up a federal government, whose administrators could be appointed from representatives from the democratic nations, each representative having equal status. This would be the most effective way to win.

### Lu Feibo Dies in Hong Kong

Mr. Lu Feibo, the general manager of the Zhong Dong Book Company, dedicated himself to the cultural enterprise for over thirty years. After the war, the company's main store moved to Hong Kong, and Mr. Lu was stationed there to plan everything. This spring, he was also appointed as a member of the National Senate Council, making many contributions to national affairs. Unexpectedly, he suddenly died of acute heart disease at his residence in Hong Kong at 9:00 AM on the 9th, at the age of only 56. Upon hearing the news, his colleagues in Shanghai and his friends in life and art mourned that he was one of the leading figures in the cultural circle of our country, and that he had suddenly passed away just as he was about to make great achievements. It is now planned to hold a memorial meeting soon. The company's Shanghai branch and its affiliates will close for one day today to express their condolences.

### American Naval Club Sold, Handover Scheduled, New Owner is the Jewish Community Center

According to officials from the Jewish Community Center, the building of the American Naval Club on Jing'an Temple Road, one of the best properties in Shanghai, was sold to the Jewish Community Center on December 15 of last year for a price of 1 million yuan in legal tender. The payment was made on the same day, and it was agreed that the American Naval Club would pay a rent of 4,000 yuan from that date and continue to lease the premises until June of this year. However, as there were no suitable buildings for the club, it was postponed until the 30th of this month to move out, and the Jewish Community Center is scheduled to take possession on October 1st.

### Japan Is Preparing to Carry Out a New Military Adventure, Judging from the Behind-the-Scenes Signs, It Seems That the Situation Is No Different from an All-Out War Against the Soviet Union

It is reported that the Millard's Review, which will be published on July 12, commented that "Japan is preparing to carry out a new military adventure." Its views are different from those who speculate that Japan will advance south. Based on the various signs discovered recently, the newspaper pointed out that Japan will carry out the following actions: (1) As a result of contacts between Tokyo and Nanjing, Japan has agreed to increase the number of Nanjing troops to 500,000, so as to be able to extract most of the troops in China and send them to other places; (2) The Japanese government has stepped up control over the export of goods, placing 340 kinds of goods under the licensing system, which may restrict or even completely eliminate exports to countries in the yen bloc; (3) Stepping up the requisition of Japanese ships to and from the Philippines, the United States, and various countries in the Far East to transport military supplies and raw materials; (4) The change of senior Japanese generals in China, Lieutenant General Itagaki, chief of staff of the Japanese army in China, has been promoted to general and appointed as the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Korea. Itagaki is a radical anti-Soviet element, and the area under his jurisdiction is adjacent to the Soviet Maritime Province, which is noteworthy; (5) Although Japanese military and politicians are still vague, they have constantly published their pro-war speeches; (6) The rise of militarism in Japanese newspapers; (7) The Japanese Emperor frequently inquires of Konoe, Matsuoka, and the heads of the combat units. All actions indicate that there is a major goal behind the scenes that they want to achieve.

### Two Cargo Ships Arrive in Shanghai, Cargo Congestion

The American cargo ship "Auralie", with a deadweight of 3,976 tons, was ordered to sail on the Far East route, carrying cargo between Shanghai and the United States. The ship was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 9:00 am today, traveling from New York via Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Manila. It will dock at the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf in Hongkou.

With 4,000 tons of cargo, this ship carries a huge amount of American goods, totaling 4,000 tons. It will stay in Shanghai until next Monday to load cargo and leave Shanghai, traveling via Hong Kong, Manila, Los Angeles, and the Panama Canal to return to the United States. Its sister ship, "Taulonate", with a deadweight of 2,977 tons, will follow next Saturday from New York on the same route to Shanghai with cargo, and is also scheduled to stay in Shanghai for three days before returning to the United States.

Arriving with 40,000 bags of rice

The Thai cargo ship "S.S. Disunthon Nawa", with a deadweight, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Rangoon via Hong Kong. The ship carried 40,000 bags of rice and 600 tons of cargo. This batch of rice is intended to supply the Shanghai people's food needs, so it is expected that the local rice price will gradually decline.

### Dredging of the Bund in Pudong

The Navigation Notice of the Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Department states that the Hong Kong dredger of the Dredging Bureau is currently working in the main waterway of the Huangpu River, near the second buoy on the Shanghai Bund side. Around the 14th of this month, it will move to dredge about 3,200 feet upstream of the 　buoy on the Pudong Bund side in the main waterway of the Huangpu River. This project will continue upstream until it reaches the middle of the second and third buoys. The dredger will be working in a narrow waterway. All crew members navigating ships in the Huangpu River should use an extremely slow speed as far as possible when passing the Shanghai side of the dredger to ensure safety. They should pay considerable attention to the narrowness of the navigation channel and sound a long whistle when passing the dredger so that the ship has sufficient time to loosen its side anchor chains if necessary. The working signal of the dredger as indicated in Announcement No. 10 of this Department on August 25, 1932, will continue to be displayed as usual. A brightly lit sign indicating the word "Dredger" will be hung at both ends of the dredger on the Shanghai side for observation. In addition, navigators must not overlook that there are two side anchor chains on the side of the dredger close to the waterway, so ships should not be too close to the dredger. Also, ships sailing near the dredger should not overtake the ship in front or pass the oncoming ship. Furthermore, drawings of this dredging project can be obtained from this department, the Pilot Association, or the Engineering Department of the Dredging Bureau. All shipping merchants should be informed.

### A Record of Escorting Students to the Entrance Exam at Van Wong Du

— Zhao Erqian

This week, Tuesday and Wednesday, was the date of the entrance examination for new students at St. John's University. The buses to Van Wong Du were filled with countless young men and women, each with a victorious feeling, holding not only physics and chemistry books and an inkstone, but also examination treasures, such as exam guides and exam essentials. Therefore, many persevering students were still doing temporary cramming five minutes before entering the examination hall, which can be said to be diligent. St. John's is one of China's famous universities, an old Shanghai university. Enrollment has never been advertised, but this time there were as many as 600 people coming. Even in the hot summer, the heat is oppressive, but once you pass the dragon gate, your prestige will increase tenfold, so even if you are sweating, it is still worth the trip.

Speaking of which, it is strange that I came to Van Wong Du this time not to take the St. John's exam myself. Although I, with my graying hair, have the heart to study diligently and strive for self-improvement, rotten wood cannot be carved again, and I will inevitably be rejected by the school. So I came to escort the examinee, accompanying a smart, studious, diligent, and promising young man to take the exam. After entering the school gate, I felt that today's St. John's is very different from what it was twenty years ago. In the past, opposite the St. John's school gate, there were gardens with lush flowers and trees reaching into the clouds. Today, it can no longer be seen. It is said that it is a part of Zhaofeng Park, today's zoo.

I think Zhaofeng Park and St. John's University are the most beautiful places in western Shanghai. The two were originally one in terms of terrain. Although there is a gulf of Jessfield Road separating them, it cannot hide the beauty of the two complementing each other. St. John's is the epitome of Oxford or Cambridge in China. Here, there is a campus of dozens of acres, with the sounds of birds and wind, fragrant flowers and plants, and the banks of the Suzhou River in the depths of the woods. Everywhere is suitable for emotional expression and cultivating temperament. It is not only a place where nature and humans become one, but also easily inspires young people's inspiration and cultivates their noble and great personalities, in order to serve society and the country in the future. A beautiful environment has a great impact on education. If school life can be isolated from urban life, it may produce better results in terms of discipline and morality. There are many historical universities in continental Europe, such as the University of Paris or the University of Leuven, whose school buildings and dormitories are mixed with markets. American universities, on the other hand, are mostly established in scenic areas, independent from the city, cultivating a pure and noble school life. Their "Campus" is rarely seen in Europe. The advantages and disadvantages of the two have much room for educators to choose and discuss.

After touring the St. John's campus, I met Professor Tucker, a mathematics professor. He said to me: "This exam is extremely strict. Although there are as many as 600 applicants, the number of students admitted by the school is extremely limited. We not only want the new students to be of good standard, but we only admit the new students with the best standard." I could only say yes to this old professor, and at the same time worry about the young people in the classroom. They are writing furiously, like fighters on the battlefield, bravely advancing and striving for the final victory. This exam was held separately in Sih Yan Hall and the social room of the Red Mansion, and was enthusiastically hosted by the St. John's Christian Fellowship, which made the new students feel a lot of convenience. This is something everyone should be grateful for.

### Assassination Occurred Yesterday at the Intersection of Bali Bridge Street and Vegetable Market Street, Shot in the Chest After Stepping Out of the Hotel, the Deceased Was Named Zhang Tingsheng, also Known as Li Changpei

At about 1:00 pm yesterday, an assassination suddenly occurred on Bali Bridge Street, Vegetable Market Street, in the French Concession. The deceased was named Zhang Tingsheng, who was shot in the head, and a stray bullet also injured a pedestrian. The details of the case are recorded as follows:

Secluded Hotel

The Datong New Hotel at No. 94 Bali Bridge Street, French Concession, received a guest on July 7, and opened Room 472 for him. He signed Zhang Tingsheng, a local, 39 years old, a worker, in the circulation book. Yesterday at 1:00 pm, Zhang, wearing a black silk shirt and trousers and white shoes, stepped out of the hotel. Unexpectedly, at the intersection of Vegetable Market Street, two men in short clothes who had been lying in ambush suddenly pulled out pistols and fired three shots at Zhang in succession.

Suddenly Shot

Zhang was caught off guard. He was shot in the back of the head. The bullet instantly penetrated his skull, his brains splattered, and he fell to the ground and died. The two shooters, seeing this, disappeared into the crowd. The French police had already received the news and immediately dispatched detectives to rush to the scene. They immediately sent the deceased to the mortuary and sent pedestrian A, who was injured by the stray bullet, to the hospital for treatment. Currently, the police are investigating the case and investigating who the deceased was.

Injured a Peddler

According to subsequent investigations, Zhang was actually named Li Changpei, from Yanlu Prefecture, residing at No. 198 Lafayette Road. Before being assassinated yesterday, a woman with a Yangzhou accent went to Li's room and chatted with Li for a long time before leaving. Unexpectedly, he was shot immediately. At that time, Li was still running away wounded to the entrance of Lukaojian at No. 258 before collapsing and dying. As for pedestrian A, who was injured by the stray bullet, it was later found that his name was Yu Cheng, from Jiangbei, 21 years old, a peddler, residing in Yangjiadu, Pudong.

One Wife and One Concubine

Furthermore, it is reported that Li Changpei, a native of Yangzhou residing at No. 198 Lafayette Road, is 39 years old this year and previously held a position in politics. He has a wife, Qiao (34 years old), and a concubine, Zhang (33 years old). The night before, Li and his wife, Qiao, went out for a stroll and opened a room at the Datong New Hotel at No. 94 Bali Bridge Street (Vegetable Market Street), French Concession, Room 412, using the pseudonym Zhang Tingsheng, 39 years old, (from Hebei) in the circulation book. At around 12:00 noon yesterday, Li, wearing a silk shirt and trousers, white leather shoes, and a straw hat, walked out of the Datong New Hotel with his wife, Qiao.

Husband and Wife Exit Together

While walking east, two men who had been lying in ambush there suddenly caught up with Li from behind, pulled out pistols, and fired five or six shots at Li. Two bullets hit Li's back and penetrated his chest. After being wounded, Li still ran east for his life to the front of No. 258 Vegetable Market Street before collapsing to the ground. Because the injuries were in vital parts, he soon died.

Wailing Loudly over the Body

Li's wife, Qiao, saw her husband being shot and falling to the ground. She rushed up, hugged him, and cried loudly, shouting for help. The two murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled eastward. When they reached the intersection of Western Water and Fire Street, the sentry police heard the alarm and rushed to the scene.

Recently, Zhang A'ming and Diao Wen'e came to Shanghai together to find work, and Gao also followed them to Shanghai. The three of them lived in Room 15, Hongfa Hotel, Baoyu Lane, Avenue Edward VII. Now, Gao, due to financial difficulties, does not hesitate to force his fiancée to engage in prostitution. Zhang, unable to resist, had to submit. Unexpectedly, after receiving customers four times, Zhang was infected with venereal disease, so she refused to receive customers again. Gao, due to financial constraints, and because Zhang was unwilling to engage in prostitution again, secretly planned to sell Zhang to an old woman at No. 73, Lane 66, Xin Zha Road for 600 yuan, and agreed to sign the contract the day before yesterday. Zhang and Diao Wen'e learned of this and joined forces to resist Gao. Gao even resorted to violence, biting Diao on the arm. The matter was detected by Zhao Zifeng, a Chinese detective from the Old Gate Police Station, who arrested Gao and Tao Lianqiao, who introduced the sale.

### The Mission of the Shanghai Children's Library

— Hu Zuyin

The only Shanghai Children's Library in China, after a long period of preparation, will open at 2 pm on the 12th of this month at its location on Dahua Road, Jing'an Temple Road. Taking advantage of this opening opportunity, I would like to present the library's three missions to seek advice from all sectors of society:

(1) To meet the needs of all kinds of children: Shanghai is a vast area, and it is actually impossible to serve all the children in the city from one central location. Although the library is located in a convenient location, the difficulties of time, economy, and safety prevent children from all districts of the city from coming to the library to read. Therefore, we plan to set up 30 circulation stations in various districts of the city to circulate books in place of the main library. We hope that the children in the schools in each district will also be able to enjoy the convenience of reading and borrowing books. For the homeless children in the streets and alleys, we plan to use mobile library vehicles to provide them with free access to excellent reading materials. In addition, some foreigners also donated funds during this fundraising campaign, and the Rotary Club of Shanghai is currently soliciting thousands of Chinese and Western children's books on behalf of the library. Therefore, the library is willing to serve children of all nationalities in Shanghai to the extent possible.

(2) To provide children with excellent reading materials: There are many excellent children's books published by bookstores today, but there are also many that are not so good. In particular, the children's books published by small bookstores and novel stalls are often absurd, preposterous, obscene, and seditious. We have collected nearly 10,000 children's books this time. We have completed the work of registration, classification, cataloging, and binding. In the future, we also want to establish a children's book review committee to negatively advise children not to read bad reading materials, and positively edit excellent reading materials suitable for children's psychology for children to read.

(3) To guide children in reading newspapers and periodicals: Children's comprehension and thinking abilities are not yet fully developed and need guidance. For the library's various reading and borrowing procedures, we have compiled detailed borrowing methods for children to request. When children come to the library, our librarians will do their best to provide convenience in retrieving books, returning books, and borrowing books. What is especially important is to arouse children's interest in reading and guide children in reading methods. In the future, we plan to hold reading lectures, new book introduction meetings, story competitions, and reading achievement report meetings as concrete work to guide children in reading.

Finally, we would like to take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude to the ladies and gentlemen who have supported the library in the past, both materially and spiritually. We hope that people from all walks of life will not hesitate to guide us and supervise us in order to achieve our mission. We hope that all the children in the city will fully participate in all the activities of the library, so that we can achieve the goal of serving all the children in the city.

### Various Perspectives on "The Palace of Qing Dynasty"

— Yuanshen

In the past few days, various newspapers have reported on Ying Yin's refusal to play in "The Palace of Qing Dynasty", and it is even rumored that Fei Mu will not be directing it either. In order to clarify the truth, the reporter interviewed various parties concerned. The detailed report is as follows:

Ying Yin, who plays Consort Zhen, said: "I have decided not to play the role of Consort Zhen. It's not that I don't want to play it, it's just that my health hasn't been very good recently, and Tianfeng is too hasty in doing things. They issued the script to the actors on the 5th, and it will be staged in September. People are not machines, how can they do it? In this play, I have to wear Qing Dynasty cheongsams, wear high heels, and kneel while reciting lines. Without a month of practice, no matter what, it will end in failure. So I have to refuse to play."

Shu Shi, who plays Emperor Guangxu, said: "I really like the script of "The Palace of Qing Dynasty", because it is a powerful exposure of the Qing government's internal and external politics. The meaning is naturally very serious. Since I directed "Yue Fei" and suffered setbacks, this play seems to have given me a little excitement and can still be enjoyable. So I won't refuse to play it, even if my body is not "comfortable", I will definitely go on stage with illness."

Director Fei Mu said: "I am busy directing "Hong Yijiao", this is true, but I am still working hard to fulfill my duties for "The Palace of Qing Dynasty". The rumors that I have disagreements with Tianfeng are completely unfounded."

Yao Ke, the playwright and director of the performance department, said: "Some people say that I feel quite thorny about the performance of "The Palace of Qing Dynasty" and have the intention of submitting my resignation to the authorities. This is completely baseless and unfounded."

The news released by the Tianfeng Drama Club said: "The role of Consort Zhen in "The Palace of Qing Dynasty" was originally played by Ying Yin, but because the play is extremely heavy and Ying Yin is unwilling to play it, it has been decided to invite Murong Wan'er to take over. As for Ying Yin's frail health, it is secondary."

Murong Wan'er said: "Since I was assigned to play the role of Consort Zhen, I have been working day and night to memorize the lines and study the movements. I have never been so excited. Although I may not be able to play it very well this time, I believe that I am doing my best and can at least achieve the condition of "not making a mess"."

Summarizing the opinions of all parties above, we know that the performance of "The Palace of Qing Dynasty" is no longer a problem.

The reporter learned from another source that the performance of "The Palace of Qing Dynasty" will be no later than the 17th. If it can be earlier, it will be the 15th. Please look forward to it.

### Zhang Eyun Goes to Tianjin to Perform for a Month and Then Returns South

Zhang Eyun and her sister Yiyun took the Taikoo Shengjing Wheel to Tianjin the morning after broadcasting at the Daya Radio Station on the 4th. This trip to Tianjin is in response to an invitation from the Tianjin Chinese Grand Theater. She will take the stage in the seventh month of the old lunar calendar and perform for a month. Zhang's famous Cheng-style play "Mei Fei" will be performed this time. Once the performance is over, she will return to Shanghai immediately.

### Letter

To the editor of the Entertainment World of Shen Bao: Regarding Hu Rongrong's enrollment issue at our school, Hu Rongrong and her two younger siblings were admitted to our school last semester. At the beginning of the semester, the student's parents sent a letter requesting permission for the three students to take leave every Saturday. If this precedent were set, other students would follow suit, and the course schedule and examination time would be disrupted. Therefore, the reply did not grant permission. Therefore, the fact that the three students cannot attend classes on Saturday is considered "absence" rather than "leave" by the school. As for the allegation that our school refused to collect tuition fees and refused to issue transfer certificates, there are also discrepancies with the facts. Since the three students are studying at our school and their inability to attend classes on Saturday has caused various inconveniences, it is better for the three students to transfer to another school next semester. Therefore, their tuition fees were not collected, and they were introduced to Huizhong School, which belongs to the same Adventist Church as the three students. Hu Rongrong has graduated from elementary school this year, and the graduation certificate issued by our school is sufficient proof for her to apply to other schools. As for her two younger siblings, they did not complete the examination subjects during this final examination. According to the general school regulations, they should be considered as not having completed the academic program of this semester. Our school is no exception in this regard, and naturally cannot provide transfer certificates. Therefore, the claim of "refusal to issue" is purely fabricated. (Omitted below) I am afraid that the truth is not clear, so I briefly describe the details, hoping you will take it into consideration. Respectfully submitted to the editor of the Entertainment World of Shen Bao, the Teaching Affairs Office of Jinde Girls' Middle School Attached Elementary School, July 8th.

Chapter 12: As Helpless as Ning Wuzi

But One-Horned Tiger would not easily forgive him, and spurred his horse to chase after him. Xu Jing only cared about escaping, and One-Horned Tiger only cared about chasing. After chasing for more than ten miles, not many bandit soldiers followed behind. Xu Jing was confused and didn't know what road he was on, but he saw a hillside ahead. Xu Jing wondered whether to escape or turn around and fight that guy to the death? Just as he was hesitating, he suddenly heard the sound of a bell. A horse ran out from behind the hillside, with a handsome young man sitting on it, holding a treasure sword across his chest, full of heroic spirit. It was Liu Yinying, whom he had been waiting for day and night, but who was late in coming. This joy was truly unexpected! He shouted, "Brother, save me!" At this time, Liu Yinying had also seen Xu Jing running away in a panic, and also saw the bandit general One-Horned Tiger chasing after him like a whirlwind. He took out a dart from his waist bag, raised his hand, and shot it straight at One-Horned Tiger's throat. One-Horned Tiger heard the sound of the dart and hurriedly dodged his head. A dart hit his shoulder, scaring him. He quickly turned his horse and fled. When the bandit soldiers saw that their general was injured, they rushed forward to protect him and retreat. When Xu Jing saw Liu Yinying knock back One-Horned Tiger with a dart, he was even happier. He stepped forward to meet him and said, "Thank you, brother, for saving me, but why did you come only today? General Zhou and I have been looking forward to you until our eyes are sore!" When Liu Yinying saw the bright red blood on Xu Jing's arm, he knew that he had been wounded, so he frowned and said, "This is something I am very sorry about. How did you get injured, brother? I'm afraid there are bandit soldiers chasing us here. This is not a place to talk. Just now, I passed by the front mountain and saw an ancient temple in the mountain pass, which is very secluded. Why don't you come with me to talk there?" Xu Jing nodded and said, "Okay." So he followed Liu Yinying and rode away. Turning over the hillside and crossing a ridge, they saw a row of yellow walls in the woods on the other side. The two ran close, jumped off their horses, and saw that the temple was old. There was a plaque in front of the temple gate, which read "Anchan Temple" in three large characters, which had been eroded for half of it. The temple gate was closed tightly. Liu Yinying stepped forward and knocked on the door a few times. After a long time, an old monk with a hunchbacked body came out to open the door. When he saw the appearance of the two, his face changed color in fright. Liu Yinying said, "We are government soldiers and were chased here in a hurry by bandit soldiers. This general has been injured, so please guide us to your temple to rest. We will not harm you." (112)

Spring and Autumn

### The Value of Hygiene

— Yuan Lewei

This year's watermelon will cost five yuan each. Even the good fortune of eating watermelon has to be raised a level. As for the interest of enjoying the cool under the bean trellis, it seems difficult to seek it in the dark for those who are not particularly imaginative. However, the pigeon nest and horse shed-like rooms and lofts are driving people outdoors. As a result, the back streets, hall entrances, and garbage cans are filled with crowds of people.

The little brother of the Zhang family across the street took a hygiene book and publicized it widely, saying that this is hygiene and that is hygiene. Spitting everywhere is not good, pouring medicine residue everywhere is not good, and urinating everywhere is even worse. This caused Mrs. Li's complaints, vowing that she was not lying. Last time she stepped on a pile of medicine residue and got sick when she went back.

Once the topic was opened, a debate was inevitable. Grandma Wang had historical evidence, saying that pouring medicine residue was not a bad thing, because it had existed since ancient times. "Once upon a time, there was a Ye Tianshi, an amazing doctor. One day, he was passing by a place in a sedan and saw the medicine residue on the ground. He immediately found out that there were two medicines in it, one cold and one hot. The cold and heat were not balanced, which was a prescription prescribed by a mediocre doctor. He got out of the sedan to inquire and changed the prescription, saving a life." This shows the importance of pouring medicine residue. Everyone was moved by this myth. However, the second aunt of the Shen family next door was a theorist of "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for application", believing that pouring medicine residue was indeed important, but the "foreign" hygienic principles were also correct. She agreed with flush toilets, but foreign toilet paper was not as good as Chinese toilet paper. Therefore, hygiene must be implemented according to the local conditions and does not have to be rigid everywhere.

But in the end, it was the old man Zhou who was knowledgeable. He could recite several "Newly Compiled Proven Prescriptions" by heart and used them to benefit the world and spread them widely.

The most激烈的 was still Grandma Wang, who thought that not only did "hygiene" not make sense, but because medicine was only for curing diseases and could not cure fate. "Once upon a time, there was a famous doctor who was really effective in curing diseases and was accurate in everything. One time he saw a doctor, but it was not effective. The patient died after taking the medicine. The doctor did not believe it and went to the underworld to ask Yama. Yama said, "If everyone is cured, what will I do?" Therefore, later when doctors saw patients who died, they would say, "I only treat diseases, not fate. Although the person died, the disease was finally cured." This statement really left everyone speechless, so the value of hygiene was determined, saying "It doesn't make much sense".

But, on that evening, the old man Zhou vomited and diarrhea. The prescriptions were not effective, and burning ingots was useless. The second landlord insisted on sending him to the epidemic hospital, where he was given injections and medicine, and he got better. On the second evening, when hygiene was discussed again, there were some new materials. Mrs. Li said that the old man Zhou must have fallen ill because he stepped on the medicine residue without realizing it, so we should pay attention to hygiene. The second aunt of the Shen family believed that injections were certainly good, but it was not necessary to pay attention to hygiene because of this. You see, except for the old man Zhou, no one else got sick. The old man Zhou himself had no opinion, but he believed that the injections were indeed very effective, and wondered if they came from "Newly Compiled Proven Prescriptions".

But Grandma Wang only had one sentence, saying "His life was not destined to end".

Alas! The value of hygiene.

### Pulling Strings

— Compass

Standing like a Marquis, but not leaping through the Dragon Gate

My father teaches at a certain ×× school. The arrival of summer vacation is an opportunity for him to rest a little and read some books himself. However, the sudden increase in guests at home these past two days has made my father waver in his plans.

The reason why there are more guests at my house is not because my father has become an important person or because something major has happened to the family. The main reason is that the school my father teaches at is about to hold entrance exams, and the guests all have the same purpose! Pulling strings.

Today, my father had not been up for long when a guest came. He was an old friend of my father's and also had some relatives. He was very familiar. So after sitting for a while and exchanging pleasantries, he took out a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to my father: "This time, I have a nephew taking the exam at your school. His grades are not bad on weekdays. I heard that your school's mathematics standards are very high and it is not easy to be admitted. This time, I would like to ask my old friend to help a lot, help a lot."

My father's answer seemed to have a formula: he always smiled and took the paper, which had the applicant's name and number written on it, and said, "Of course, of course, I will do my best to help, but a small teacher does not have much power."

The guest seemed to have finished an important matter and picked up his hat to leave: "Brother, don't be polite. ×× schools are not like national ones. It's always good to think of a way, hee hee... Please, please!"

When sent to the door, the guest repeatedly exhorted: "This time, it all depends on you, all depends on you." So it was as if he had taken on a debt. If he did not do his best, he would be letting his friend down.

Perhaps after sending one guest away, the second one would come one after another. Then the conversation just now would be repeated again, and one or two more applicants' names would be added to my father's list.

The people who came to ask for help were either relatives or friends, or they had someone write a letter of introduction and brought the applicant with them. If he agreed to one, how could he turn back on the second one! So, he accepted everything, with every request met. My father had to say more than a dozen times a day that he would definitely help, definitely help.

When it was time for dinner, my father flipped through the list of names he had received during the day. My mother said, "Surely no one will come today, right?" "Maybe not," my father recorded the names he had received one by one, preparing to go to school the next day. "At this time, it is not easy for parents to take out a sum of money, so they desperately hope that their children can successfully pass the exam. But how would they know that asking for help is of any use, and whether the school's new students are admitted or not is entirely decided by the principal!" My father sighed again.

In the classroom, the teacher was gesturing and lecturing alone, and the students were all listless.

Suddenly, a few students actually started smoking.

"Hey, cheer up! Sigh! Why are you smoking?" It was the teacher's voice.

The students replied: "We are smoking in order to cheer up!"

On the corner of a road, several gentlemen in white coats were administering street injections.

"Come and get a vaccination. Getting vaccinated can increase your body's resistance." A gentleman pulled a little urchin and explained to him.

"I don't need to get vaccinated. If my body's resistance was weak, I would have died long ago."

10. A Father's Heart

"Mei Bao, be good! Didn't you say that Dad's clothes were all wet by the rain? Then, why are you still letting your tears fall on my shoulder?" He said jokingly.

Mei Bao was indeed amused and stopped crying.

"Dad, I was crying because I was worried that you would get sick again." As she said this, she stuffed her clean little handkerchief into Begonia's collar, lining it against his back, intending to block some of the cold air for him. "You know, when you got sick the year before last and lay in bed, how uncomfortable were you? I couldn't even study at school. You refused to spend money, and Little Gouzi and I went to ask a doctor several times, but you stopped us and didn't allow us to do it. It was hard to get him to secretly invite one; you still refused to spend money to prescribe medicine and scolded Little Gouzi..."

These were all true words, and Begonia had no way to argue with her.

"Okay, child, if you get sick again this time, I will definitely let you go and ask a doctor!" He could only coax her like this.

"I'm afraid you won't allow it by then!"

"It's all because of money!" Begonia sighed deeply. "Child, we poor people can only endure some hardship, otherwise how can we live in the future?"

Mei Bao leaned on his shoulder and thought silently for a while.

"You are poor, so I am naturally poor too." She held Begonia's face, which was covered with short stubble, in her hands, focusing her gaze on his two eyes, which always looked very melancholy. "Then why do I have to dress so neatly, while you and Little Gouzi eat corn and cornbread every day? Why do I immediately ask a doctor and take medicine when I get sick, while you just lie in bed and hum? ... Dad, why? I must know!" (155)

### A Certain Grand Feast

— Star Flower

Eat Plain Rice · Blitzkrieg Tactics  Don't Imitate · Sigh Empty Bowl

Today, I don't know what festival it is, but the shop has prepared several tables of dishes to invite us clerks and assistants to gorge ourselves. There were ten of us at one table, only Mr. Song had a higher position than us, and the assistants' salaries were paid by him. Although the dishes today are not very good, they are worlds apart from the usual bowl of salted vegetables and bean sprouts.

Sadly, we nine assistants originally wanted to have a feast, but seeing Mr. Song sitting there authoritatively, who wouldn't pretend to be polite? I didn't make a sound and only cared about stuffing plain rice into my stomach. After eating half a bowl, I reached out my chopsticks and picked up a piece of meat. This meat was as thin as paper, and if there had been a gust of wind at that time, it would have definitely soared into the sky. Just as I was chewing, I felt a piercing light. I looked up in surprise and saw seven or eight eyes staring at me in unison. Especially Mr. Song's eyes, glaring at me as if to say, "Hey! You are too ignorant of the rules. You're eating too much of the dishes. There are only seven pieces in total for ten people to eat! You are not polite at all, picking it up and eating it." I hurriedly ate a lot of plain rice to atone for my "crime," only eating a little bit of vegetables. Later, I don't know how I got confused again, and I stuck my chopsticks into the bowl of braised eggs. Another wave of gazes came, putting me in a tiger-riding situation. It was not good to pick it up, and it was not good to put my chopsticks down. I had no choice but to muster up my courage and, with lightning speed, picked up an egg and ate it. This time was no small matter. In addition to the dozen or so eyes that I attracted, Mr. Song also said to the others:

"Please eat! If you don't eat, it will soon be eaten up."

"Mr. Song, you don't have to be polite either! Please, please." the assistants replied, but they dared not touch any meat or fish, letting Mr. Song gorge himself. I had no choice but to swallow more plain rice, watching how "carefree" he was eating. Fortunately, a clever idea came to mind, and I picked up a large piece of braised pig's trotter and sent it to Mr. Song's bowl.

"Mr. Song, don't be polite, eat it!" I said this, but in my heart, I wished I could stuff it into my own mouth.

"Hmm, thank you! You don't have to be polite either!"

This was exactly what I wanted to hear, so I took the opportunity to pick up a small piece and ate it myself. I was secretly happy, but unexpectedly, the other assistants also began to "imitate Dong Shi," sending large pieces of shrimp and fish as gifts. Several bowls of dishes were soon emptied.

"Enjoy your meal, enjoy your meal!" Mr. Song left full and satisfied. As soon as he left, the assistants became very impolite, grabbing all the dishes with all their might. I had no choice but to "lament my misfortune" and eat plain rice.

This meal, all in all, was not a great "failure." I also ate an egg, a piece of meat, a chopstick of pig's trotter, and a lot of half-cooked vegetables.
