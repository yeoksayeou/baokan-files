### U.S. and Britain Determine Foreign Policy: Major Developments Brewing in the Far East, Grew and Toyoda Met Twelve Times Last Week, Newly Appointed Japanese Ambassador to Britain to Depart for London

Washington, 9th (International News Agency) – It is widely expected that Washington will make a major decision this week regarding its foreign policy and relations between the U.S. and Britain with Japan. It is believed that Washington's decision is due to the stalemate in U.S.-Japan talks and Japan's reliance on the Axis powers. Officials and diplomatic circles believe that although the military faction and some newspapers in Tokyo have adopted a belligerent attitude, Japan has a significant chance of breaking away from the Axis and favoring closer ties with the U.S. and Britain. It is reported that Prime Minister Konoe is scheduled to make a public announcement on Wednesday after an audience with the Emperor, supporting amity with the United States. The State Department has been striving to reach a "standstill agreement" with Japan to prevent the United States from being drawn into the situation in the Pacific. According to the above information, there seems to be a greater possibility of progress in U.S.-Japan talks. However, as officials have not yet released any public announcements regarding the progress, the speculation that major developments are brewing is increasingly credible.

New York, 9th (United Press) – Columbia Broadcasting System has received a radio broadcast from Tokyo stating that qualified Japanese sources anticipate President Roosevelt will announce something regarding U.S.-Japan relations in his speech on Thursday.

Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – Foreign Minister Toyoda reported to the Cabinet today on recent diplomatic developments.

Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – Deputy Spokesman Ishii of the Cabinet Information Bureau stated today that, from Japan's point of view, the most important issue at present is important, and that although some matters are important, "I regret that I cannot comment on this matter at this time."

Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew has met with Foreign Minister Toyoda twelve times in the past week, making it the busiest period of U.S.-Japan diplomatic activity in Tokyo during Grew's nine-year tenure. It was also announced that Nomura's special advisor, Wakasugi, will return to Washington by ship within a few days.

### British Prime Minister Declares in the House of Commons: Prevent a Pacific War

London, 9th (Reuters) – When the House of Commons reconvened today after the summer recess, Prime Minister Churchill rose to speak amidst cheers. He first stated that the important conclusions reached during his meeting with President Roosevelt included the following four items: (1) the issuance of the Eight-Point Declaration; (2) methods of assisting the Soviet Union; (3) a policy towards Japan aimed at preventing further aggression in the Far East that would endanger the security or interests of the U.S. and Britain, and preventing the spread of war to the Pacific through timely action; and (4) discussions on a large number of purely technical matters and the establishment of close personal relationships between the senior command of the British and U.S. naval, land, and air forces.

London, 9th (United Press) – Officials announced today that the British government has reached decisions on the four main items of the recent Roosevelt-Churchill talks. The announcement stated that decisions have been made regarding the two leaders' Eight-Point Declaration, assistance to the Soviet Union, a policy towards Japan aimed at preventing the spread of war to the Pacific, and technical matters.

Tokyo, 9th (Haito News Agency) – Spokesman Ishii of the Japanese Information Bureau stated today that Britain is not participating in the ongoing talks between Japan and the U.S. in Washington, and that Japan and Britain are not conducting such talks in London. He continued by saying that the new Japanese Ambassador to Britain will soon be departing for London, but refused to announce his name.

Honolulu, 9th (United Press) – New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, after completing his trip to Britain in April and meeting with President Roosevelt, left here yesterday aboard a Clipper en route to Antipodes. It is reported that "if the situation worsens and the small democracies of the Pacific face aggression, the United States will not stand idly by." He predicted that U.S.-Japan negotiations would be "completely successful," meaning that further wartime actions by Japan in the Far East would be prevented.

Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – Governor-General of Taiwan, General Shao Lin, wrote in the "Kokumin Shimbun" yesterday that although the South Seas are Japan's economic lifeline, "if you mistakenly believe that the 'Co-Prosperity Sphere' is solely for the benefit of the Japanese, then you will never achieve the purpose of the 'Co-Prosperity Sphere.'" He also said that if Japan appears only as "another aggressor," then the natives of the South Seas will unite with the current rulers to resist Japan.

### Japan Sends Ships to British Territories to Evacuate Nationals

Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that, in return for Japan's allowing Britain to send a ship to Japan to pick up British nationals, Britain has also agreed to allow Japan to send ships to British territories to evacuate Japanese nationals. The British ship sent to Japan will arrive on September 24 to evacuate 1,000 British nationals who are not of British descent. Three Japanese ships will be sent to the Straits Settlements, India, the Near East, and Africa, respectively. A fourth Japanese ship will transport diplomats and military attachés to Europe to replace those currently in Europe. When the ships return to Japan, they will carry Japanese nationals from Europe and other regions back home. It is reported that there are currently 600 Japanese nationals in Britain, 700 in Malaya, 60 in India, and 40 in East Africa.

Washington, 9th (International News Agency) – State Department officials revealed that negotiations between the U.S. and Japan on the evacuation of nationals have made some progress. Japan has proposed that one Japanese ship carry 1,000 U.S. nationals back to the United States, and that the ship carry 300 Japanese nationals back to Japan on its return trip. Japan has also proposed that the U.S. and Japan operate a weekly service for mail and passengers. Although these evacuation negotiations are underway, they are completely separate from the exploratory talks on the fundamental relationship between the U.S. and Japan.

### Ishii Talks to Reporters About Japan-Soviet Commercial Treaty

Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – Deputy Spokesman Ishii of the Cabinet Information Bureau told reporters that the Japan-Soviet commercial treaty will soon be submitted to the Privy Council for approval, but the date has not yet been set. He also said that in previous years, when Japan-Soviet relations were tense, Japan did not object to the U.S. transporting oil to Vladivostok because the U.S. was also transporting oil to Japan. Reliable observers here speculate that Ishii's statement is roughly to the effect that if the U.S. resumes transporting oil to Japan, then the issue of transporting oil to Vladivostok will no longer exist.

### Indian Troops Defend Malayan Airfields

Simla, 9th (Reuters) – Almost all of the British airfields in the Malay Peninsula are now being defended by Indian troops. These troops include those belonging to the Indian Army Headquarters, as well as infantry recruited from various princely states of India and dispatched by the British government. They have been trained to recognize the markings on British, U.S., German, Italian, Japanese, Thai, and Dutch aircraft, and are well-versed in the lessons learned from the air battles in Norway, Greece, and Crete, and methods of dealing with dive bombers and paratroopers. Recent demonstrations have shown that the defense arrangements are quite comprehensive. The important role played by Indian troops in the defense of Malaya is evident here.

### Japan's Obligations to the Axis to Be Carefully Studied, Believes U.S.-Germany Dispute Is Unrelated to Japan

Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – Deputy Spokesman Ishii of the Cabinet Information Bureau stated that there are many different opinions regarding the Greer incident, and that "we cannot determine who is telling the truth and who is not. Therefore, we must wait and see before we can criticize."

Tokyo, 9th (Reuters) – The "Japan Times," mouthpiece of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated yesterday that the Greer incident has placed U.S.-Germany relations in a new environment. From now on, if U.S. and German warships encounter each other in the German-designated blockade zone, war will inevitably break out. The "Asahi Shimbun" also predicts that similar conflicts will occur in the future, leading to war between the U.S. and Germany. If the U.S. continues to disregard the blockade zones established by Germany and Italy, war between the U.S., Germany, and Italy will be unavoidable. The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated that regardless of the new developments caused by this incident, Japan will continue its policy of working towards world peace, and that whether the obligations of the Tripartite Pact are affected by this incident will depend on a careful study of future developments.

Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – Japanese newspapers in Tokyo unanimously predicted today that the Greer incident may become the path for the United States to enter the war. The newspapers also stated that the United States must be responsible for this incident, as the United States has repeatedly violated international law in the past. However, as of today, all Japanese reactions to the Greer incident consider it to be unrelated to Japan and not bound by the Tripartite Alliance. The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated that Japan will continue to maintain its independence and autonomy and work for world "peace," and that Japan will do its best to prevent the war from spreading to the Far East.

Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – Fascist leader Nakano, leader of the Tohwa Society, announced that he would deliver a lion-like speech in the hall of Hibiya Park today. Nakano is a key proponent of the Tripartite Pact in Japan and opposes the current policy direction of the Japanese government.

### U.S. Senate Adjourns for Three Days to Mourn the President's Mother, Pétain Sends Condolences to Roosevelt

Washington, 9th (United Press) – The Senate adjourned yesterday to mourn Mrs. Roosevelt and will reconvene on Thursday. The Senate also passed a resolution expressing its grief.

Vichy, 8th (Havas) – After receiving the news of the death of President Roosevelt's mother, Marshal Pétain sent a telegram of condolence to President Roosevelt. He had met her several times in Paris and always admired her demeanor. He was deeply saddened by her passing and sent his condolences.

### Japanese Government Appoints Yosizawa as Ambassador to Vietnam

Tokyo, 9th (United Press) – The government today appointed Yosizawa as Special Envoy and Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Vietnam, and announced that the appointment was made because relations between Japan and Vietnam have become even friendlier after the conclusion of the mutual defense pact. Yosizawa will handle diplomatic negotiations with the Governor of Vietnam and lead all Japanese institutions in the area. Former Japanese Minister to Argentina, Uchiyama, will be sent as Yosizawa's assistant. Yosizawa said that Foreign Minister Toyoda asked him to take on this position, and that "the world knows that the Dutch East Indies are rich in natural resources, but Vietnam is also very rich in rice, coal, and rubber, all of which are very important to Japan. Therefore, Japan and Vietnam have very deep political and economic ties that should be promoted, and this is my mission." The government also appointed former Consul-General in Manila, Yoshida, as Consul-General in Hanoi to assist Yosizawa.

Editorial

### The Battle for Leningrad

According to the majority of opinions from international observers these past two days, the situation in Soviet Leningrad is, generally speaking, already in a state of emergency and danger. Of course, this only refers to the perilous state of its external lines of communication, or at most, only indicates that it is facing the danger of being besieged; it certainly does not mean that the Soviet Union may soon have to consider a voluntary retreat from the area due to the heavy sacrifices and the urgent pressure it is under, and it certainly does not mean that the German forces will be able to defeat the defending forces in one fell swoop and occupy the area in the near future.

Currently, Leningrad is under the most pressure from the northwest and southwest corners. As for its northeastern fronts, the German forces are unable to reach them for the time being. Even the line of communication between its southeastern corner and Moscow, although the German forces have been attacking for many days, there is still no possibility of cutting it off in the short term. Assuming that the German forces can continue their recent fierce offensive without being pushed back by the Soviet counterattacks, then they may eventually be able to cut off the railway between Moscow and Leningrad, then send a large army to the northwest corner to launch a pincer movement, and then cut off the railway communication between Leningrad and Vologda. At that time, Leningrad's external transport routes would be declared completely cut off, and it would be under attack from all sides by the German forces. However, it is worth pointing out that even if the German forces occupy all of its vital external transport routes, it is still far from being besieged. With such a vast area as the Leningrad Military District, plus the defense of a million-strong army inside, and the support of the entire Red Army outside, it is truly difficult to think that the German forces could trap it in a heavy siege, with no internal or external communication, and then slowly encircle and eliminate it! As far as the German forces currently deployed on the northern front are concerned, this move is absolutely impossible without a large increase in manpower and weaponry; and conversely, for the attacker who is at a disadvantage in terms of quantity, the conduct of this encirclement attempt is a very dangerous thing.

The German forces are now desperately attacking in an attempt to occupy Leningrad before winter arrives, in order to temporarily achieve a more decisive victory on the northern front. However, the Soviet Union must also do its utmost to defend it, or even prepare for a lonely defense, which has many very important implications. First of all, if Leningrad falls, the situation of the entire Soviet line will be greatly shaken. The threat to Moscow may be a relatively secondary matter, but most importantly, at that time, in order to stabilize its own situation, the Soviet Union, even on the central and southern fronts, would have to consider adjusting its positions and shifting the entire line backwards. Many important industrial areas and military strongholds would also be lost as a result. Secondly, at this time when the Moscow Tripartite Conference is about to be held, the Soviet Union seems to have to maintain its military prestige at any cost. Recently, large-scale air battles between Germany and the Soviet Union have been taking place in the skies over this area. The Soviet Union is already using all its strength to fight for control of the air, so how much more the struggle for the Leningrad Military District, which is related to the prestige of the entire Soviet army! The success or failure of this battle has a very significant impact on the outcome of the Tripartite Conference. Again, the Soviet army's defense of Leningrad is indeed playing an important shielding role for its entire rear. As long as Leningrad does not fall, the German forces will not be able to advance towards Moscow; otherwise, after the German forces occupy Leningrad, they can launch a pincer movement towards Moscow, and that will be the true situation of encirclement and annihilation. Therefore, no matter what, the Soviet Union must hold the northern front in Leningrad, and even if it immediately engages in a large-scale decisive battle with the German forces, it probably cannot be spared.

Therefore, it seems that the only way for the German forces to take Leningrad is to completely defeat the Soviet forces with military power; it is absolutely impossible to force it to retreat automatically by outflanking and pressuring the Soviet forces. Since the beginning of the war, the Soviet forces on the southern and central fronts have retreated slightly, while the northern front, due to geographical reasons, has almost appeared in the form of a battle for Leningrad from the very beginning, making it impossible for the Soviet forces to retreat. Therefore, statistically, the German forces have made the least progress on this route. Leningrad is not only an important port and industrial and transportation center, but also one of the most important fortresses of the Soviet Union. Its importance to the entire Soviet Union far exceeds that of Kiev, Odessa, Minsk, and other places, and is second only to Moscow.

Then, is it possible for the German forces to capture Leningrad by force? This, on the one hand, depends on the strategy and strength of the German offensive, and on the other hand, it especially depends on the determination and strategy of the Soviet defense. Within the Leningrad Military District, the strength that the Soviet Union has now concentrated probably exceeds one million, and even if all the equipment and supplies are temporarily cut off from the outside world, they can probably be self-sufficient in the short term, which is not a problem. The lonely defense of Odessa on the southern front to this day has fully demonstrated the Red Army's ability and determination to engage in a larger-scale lonely defense. What's more, this time, the Soviet army's supreme strategy seems to be to defend by attacking. Then, assuming that the possibility of the German forces besieging Leningrad intensifies, at that time, not only in the outer ring of this area will the Soviet Union reinforce and counterattack, forming a larger encirclement of the German forces; even the Soviet forces on the southern and central fronts will simultaneously launch a larger-scale offensive, making it impossible for the German forces to concentrate their strength to attack Leningrad exclusively.

Finally, we want to point out that the momentum of the German forces' third offensive on the entire front is clearly weakening every day, and the northern front is of course no exception. Unless the German forces increase a large number of fresh troops and a large number of weapons, probably before winter, the battle for Leningrad will never escape the stalemate of a tug-of-war.

Fuzhou – On the morning of the 5th, this reporter arrived in Fuzhou, which had been recovered, on the first westbound vessel to conduct an inspection. I saw thousands of residents gathered on the riverbank, clapping their hands and waving their towels, cheering thunderously.

### Australian Minister to China Discusses Mission to China

Singapore – Australia's first Minister to China, Eggleston, is en route from Australia to the wartime capital of China to take up his new post. Speaking here, he stated that Australia is extremely interested in China's restoration of its position as a strong country in the Pacific. His mission is of great significance because it represents the Australian government's and people's sympathy for the leaders and people of China.

### Jiang Tingfu Receives Chinese and Foreign Reporters, Discusses Recent Diplomatic and Financial Situation, Relations Between China and Canada and China and Czechoslovakia Become Closer, Reform Administrative System and Unify Finances

Chongqing – Administrative Yuan Secretary-General Jiang Tingfu received Chinese and foreign reporters on the 8th and discussed the diplomatic relations between China and Canada and China and Czechoslovakia, as well as the situation of China's financial reform. Jiang first stated that the issue of China and Canada exchanging envoys has been announced, and the candidates for the first ministers of the two countries can be decided within days. What we are most satisfied with is the speech by Canadian Defense Minister Ralston, who stated that Canada will supply military materials to China and the Soviet Union, which not only indicates that the relations between China and Britain are increasingly promoted. He then stated that China recently recognized Czechoslovakia. President Beneš sent a reply to Chongqing, stating that China's kindness is extremely appreciable. Our people have always had a good impression of the Czech Republic, and President Beneš upheld justice on the Nine-One-Eight Incident in the League of Nations. The spirit of Czech democracy is also very admirable. The economic relations between the two countries in the past have also been very close. Jiang finally talked about the new initiatives in China's internal affairs, the main idea being that there will be a major reform in China's administrative system this year, namely the unification of finances. China has made very significant progress in political unification in recent years, but this is not yet apparent in the financial system. Starting from next fiscal year, the provincial budgets will be part of the central budget. The central government will instruct the main points of budget preparation and approve the estimated amount. The provincial governments will prepare the budget based on the situation within this estimated amount. At the same time, all provincial tax revenues will be directly collected by the central government. This is a major reform in Chinese politics. Afterwards, the central government can take into account the local conditions and coordinate the national financial affairs. The budgets of each province in the previous year increased by about 20 to 30 percent compared to this year. The provincial governments will certainly not feel any difficulties. This reform will inevitably involve the finances of the county governments. In the past, the finances of the provinces and counties were not clearly demarcated. In the future, the central government will decide on the revenues of the county governments, and those that are decided to belong to the county government will still be collected by the county. Those that are approved by the county council can increase taxes. Therefore, the county finances can truly become an autonomous unit in the future.

### Heavy Rain in Chongqing

Chongqing – Since late last night, there has been heavy rain here. About two-thirds of the Western Suburbs Avenue has experienced soil erosion, destroying one house and damaging telegraph and electric light lines. At the same time, some houses in Chongqing were also washed away by the heavy rain. (Reuters, 9th)

Chongqing – Chongqing experienced a very severe storm yesterday, followed by torrential rain, causing disasters that were even worse than those caused by any day of Japanese bombing this year. The roofs of the city's houses, already damaged by bombs, meant that almost every bed in the city was wet last night. The underground printing rooms of the famous newspapers here were also flooded, causing the publication of the newspapers to be delayed by several hours, but the newspapers were all published as usual. The newspapers also said that rainwater flowed in from the entrances and air vents, and the printing workers were working in knee-deep water. In the western suburbs, at least three cement surfaces collapsed, and many houses collapsed, injuring several people. In the only Western-style hotel, the Jialing Hotel, some ministers and foreign guests used umbrellas and raincoats to cover their beds, allowing them to sleep for a few hours. But when they woke up in the morning, the floor of the room was already half an hour submerged in water. (United Press, 9th)

### Air Raid on the Red Sea: American Cargo Ship Sunk, A Serious Incident Following the Greer Incident, US-German War Seems Unavoidable

United Press International, Washington, 9th: The State Department announced yesterday that the American cargo ship "Steel Seafarer" was sunk by bombs dropped by an aircraft in the Red Sea on September 7th. About twenty crew members were rescued. The identity of the aircraft that dropped the bombs is still unknown. According to Lloyd's Insurance Company, the "Steel Seafarer" belonged to the Isbrandtsen Company and had a displacement of 5,719 tons. This sinking is the first attack on an American ship in the Near East since the start of the war. Since President Roosevelt designated the Red Sea route outside the war zone on April 7th, American ships have resumed using it. The "Steel Seafarer" is the second American ship sunk in this conflict, the first being the "Robin Moor." The announcement of this American ship's sinking coincides almost exactly with the time of President Roosevelt's scheduled speech, but the speech has been postponed due to his mother's death. This incident may influence the tone of the President's speech on Thursday, as it is already speculated that the President will reiterate his policy of freedom of the seas in light of the Greer incident. Reliable sources in London say that an American supply ship, believed to be an oil tanker, has been sunk in the Near East.

Reuters, Cairo, 9th: The American ship "Steel Seafarer" sank 200 miles south of Suez on a moonlit night. Several survivors have been rescued by British ships. The ship was built in 1921 and belonged to the Isbrandtsen Steamship Company. It was carrying American military supplies for the US military in the Middle East. It is reported that German long-range bombers have recently been active at night in the area south of Suez, mostly departing from bases in the Dodecanese Islands.

Reuters, Cairo, 9th: The news of the American ship's sinking in the Red Sea has caused surprise here. Now, in addition to military supplies, Egypt's ordinary trade has also largely shifted to the United States to avoid going around the Cape of Good Hope. Therefore, in addition to a large number of military supplies, the United States is also shipping large quantities of goods and food. Any interference with this communication line will have far-reaching consequences. Most people are speculating about the impact of the American ship's sinking on the international situation.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 9th: Regarding the sinking of the American ship in the Red Sea, people here commented today that the Red Sea has long been clearly declared a war zone by Italy. If President Roosevelt does not consider the Red Sea as a war zone according to the American Neutrality Act, it is obviously inappropriate. As for the nationality of the aircraft that bombed the ship, it is still unknown.

### US Future Maritime Policy: Meeting Force with Force

Reuters, New York, 9th: President Roosevelt's upcoming broadcast speech has become a topic of discussion and speculation. Some people in Washington expect that the speech will announce that the future policy of the United States will be to meet force with force at sea. According to well-informed sources, the President will certainly propose the following points: (1) Germany and the world must know that the United States wants to maintain the smooth flow of its communication line with Iceland; (2) The discovery of any hostile warships or aircraft in the area between the United States and Iceland will be regarded as an effort to interfere with this communication; (3) American warships will be ordered to fire on any hostile warships or aircraft encountered in these territorial waters in the future.

Reuters, Washington, 9th: It is expected that President Roosevelt's remarks on Thursday will discuss the incident of the US destroyer Greer being attacked by a German submarine, and the work that the US Navy should be doing in the Atlantic now and in the future. This is clearly indicated by the observers' perception of the German reaction and comments on the Greer case, which indicate that the Atlantic war is unfavorable to the German side.

United Press International, New York, 9th: According to the British Broadcasting Corporation's broadcast yesterday of a German radio station, if the United States continues to ignore the blockaded coasts, war will be inevitable. It also stated that the depth charges dropped by the American destroyer Greer may be the first shot in an open conflict between the United States and Germany.

### Berlin Full of Anti-American Rhetoric

Reuters, Berlin, 9th: Yesterday's comments in Berlin newspapers regarding the battle between the American warship Greer and a German submarine were filled with abusive language towards President Roosevelt, with phrases such as "Roosevelt Creates Incidents," "Deceptive Depth Charges," "Lies Incite Anger," and "Roosevelt's Deceptive Actions." The Börsen Zeitung stated that Washington is currently trying to make Roosevelt's deliberately issued lies appear as facts. Its motive is just like the words of those close to Roosevelt, that is, to drive the American people into the war vortex by means of successive incidents.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 9th: Dr. Helfferich, a foreign affairs reporter for the Hamburger Fremdenblatt, commented that "The Greer incident is only enough to prove that President Roosevelt has secretly ordered his fleet to fire on German boats. Because American domestic opinion has not reached a sufficiently mature level, he is unwilling to publicly issue a firing order. If Roosevelt does not allow the American fleet to operate in the European war zone, and does not want to involve an America that has not been threatened in the war vortex, then there is absolutely no possibility of an incident occurring between the United States and Germany." His argument is enough to represent the attitude of the German newspapers towards this Greer incident. They all stated that the American warships continuously dropped depth charges on the German submarine until midnight, even though there was no result. This is indeed an act of aggression by the American military. President Roosevelt deliberately wanted to cause an incident in order to use it as an excuse to participate in the war. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung stated, "This attack on the German submarine is a fraudulent means for Roosevelt to deceive the American people. Germany has always ignored the insults he has orchestrated. Unexpectedly, he became angry and ordered American warships to fire. This public enemy has long been thinking of creating incidents to put the people in danger, and now he has achieved his goal." The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung stated, "At a time when Churchill and Canadian Prime Minister King are eagerly awaiting American participation in the war, this incident suddenly occurred, which shows Washington's intentions. Roosevelt could not explain the incident in detail at the intelligence meeting. He only said that, in view of the current situation, this must be an act of aggression, so he has decided to eliminate these bandits. "The statement issued by Germany on Saturday tore off the American mask and completely exposed the background of this incident." The Berliner Abendpost stated, "Since last month, Roosevelt has exposed his true face. He and his party members pray to God every day to grant some kind of incident so that American aid to Britain can become more active. Roosevelt's policy of alliance with the Soviet Union has made his people very dissatisfied, so he had to find a way to shift his people's attention to the Atlantic Ocean, and thus this incident occurred."

### Allied Forces Occupy Spitsbergen Without Shedding a Drop of Blood, Aim to Prevent Germany from Utilizing the Island's Coal Mines, A Strategically Important Arctic Outpost

Reuters, London, 9th: Allied forces have landed on the Spitsbergen archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, with the main purpose of preventing the German side from using the island's rich coal mines. The landing forces are Canadian, British, and Norwegian troops, led by a Canadian commander. They encountered no enemy resistance. The British War Office announced this matter, saying that for various purposes, it was decided to send a combined Canadian-British-Norwegian force to the Arctic Ocean. Under the command of a Canadian general, they have landed on the Spitsbergen archipelago without encountering enemy resistance. The main purpose of the landing is to prevent the enemy from using the island's rich coal mines for their own war purposes. Previously, part of Spitsbergen's coal was used by the people of northern Norway, but now we know the enemy's plan to seize all the coal, including that produced in Spitsbergen, exclusively for military transport to the far north. Now the German side cannot obtain this fuel source. One direct result of the Allied landing on Spitsbergen is that a large number of Norwegian miners and their families have now come to Britain to participate in the Allied war effort here. Most of them will join the Norwegian army or serve in the Norwegian merchant fleet. Spitsbergen is an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, located between the Franz Josef Land archipelago and Greenland, belonging to Norway. Its main islands are West Spitsbergen, Edge Island, Northeast Land, Barents Island, and Prince Charles Foreland. They are all mountainous, with the highest peak near Trollheimen Bay.

Havas, London, 9th: Allied forces landed yesterday on the Spitsbergen archipelago in northern Norway. Observers here all say that the island is not only of great military strategic value, but in the future, airplanes flying from North America to Murmansk, USSR, via Iceland, can also land there mid-way. In addition, it is generally believed that regarding Britain's occupation of the archipelago, and the British Air Force's continuous bombing of the Norwegian coast, it is expected that the British army will sooner or later attempt to land on the Norwegian mainland in order to echo the Red Army and achieve a restraining effect.

Reuters, London, 9th: British, Canadian and Norwegian troops landed on the archipelago of Spitsbergen in the Arctic Ocean without shedding a drop of blood, then occupied the archipelago's valuable coal mines. Germany intended to use the coal mines after the German-Soviet war began to supplement its gradually decreasing coal reserves. The British War Office issued a public statement on Monday night, revealing the news of the Allied forces landing on the archipelago of Spitsbergen. The island is 1,500 miles from the northern tip of Britain and is located in the far north. Therefore, in the first year after Norway was occupied, the various belligerent nations seemed not to pay attention to it. Although the entire territory of Norway was full of German troops, there was no action taken on the island. When the Norwegian government was still in northern Norway, it used the warmer weather to transport ample supplies to the island, because for most of the year, the island's external communication was blocked by ice. Shortly after the German side occupied Norway, it sent three military officers or mining experts to the island, who merely inspected the coal mines hastily and left. The people were able to live peacefully and undisturbed as usual during the long Arctic winter, and the Norwegian civil administrator remained on the island and administered it independently. The Soviet Union enjoys mining concessions in the Barents Island of the Spitsbergen archipelago, employing about 2,300 workers to mine coal. Perhaps the German side delayed taking action because the Soviet Union had this concession on the island, but since the German attack on the Soviet Union, Spitsbergen has entered the military operation zone. According to German reports, when preparing for war against the Soviet Union, the German side tried its best to collect the fuel supplies it could obtain in Norway, and urgently needed the coal of the Spitsbergen archipelago to supply naval tools along the Norwegian coast. However, this year's export season for Spitsbergen was one month later than usual, and navigation was still not possible in May. The amount of coal exported in June and July was very small. The large amount of coal accumulated on the archipelago in winter was simply not exported. Germany planned to have two ships travel between Norway and Spitsbergen, but the German side was obviously worried about Allied actions and could not allocate warships to protect this transportation. Those living on the Spitsbergen archipelago are all Norwegians, and there are not a few who have avoided German forced military service from northern Norway and come to these archipelagoes. According to the miners, one part of their daily life is listening to Norwegian broadcast messages from London day and night. All the islands celebrate Norwegian Independence Day.

International News Service, London, 9th: The British Navy has occupied the strategically important archipelago of Spitsbergen in the Arctic Ocean. The British side here believes that this move is a valuable way to enable all sea routes to reach the important Soviet port of Murmansk, just as the British and Soviet forces attacked Iran, intending to keep the land entrance to the Soviet Union intact. The total population of the archipelago is between 700 and 1,000, most of whom work in the Norwegian coal mines, giving the island its important position today.

### Churchill Reports on the War Situation in the House of Commons

Reuters, London, 9th: The House of Commons reconvened today. While reviewing the war situation, the Prime Minister released the progress of the Atlantic war, stating that the total tonnage of British and Allied ships sunk by the enemy in July and August was less than one-third of the tonnage of German and Italian ships sunk by the Allies during the same period. Currently, three or four German aircraft are laying mines in British territorial waters every night, but this hazard has been largely eliminated by mine-sweeping vessels using various exotic equipment. The Prime Minister continued to describe the Soviet-German war, stating that in the past three months, through the fierce resistance of the Soviet Union, the German losses have been more severe than in any year of the last Great War. The German army is bound to spend a severe winter in Soviet territory. The Soviet Union's need for British and American aid is particularly urgent, because although it has 10 million to 15 million soldiers, they all need to be armed and equipped. Currently, a large number of supplies have set out to the Soviet Union. Britain must make great sacrifices for the benefit of the Soviet Union. The Prime Minister finally reiterated the Iranian incident, stating that all German and Italian nationals in the occupied territories must surrender.

### Central Route Red Army Launches Major Counteroffensive, Recaptures Yelnya, Eight Nazi Divisions Defeated

TASS, Moscow, 9th: The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report stating that on the 8th, our army fought the enemy along the entire front. In the Smolensk area, the Soviet and German armies fought fiercely for the city of Yelnya (30 miles southeast of Smolensk) for 26 days, defeating eight German divisions. The numbers of the defeated divisions are as follows: the 15th Infantry Regiment, the SS 1st Division, the 17th Motorized Division, the 10th Tank Division, the 137th Infantry Division, and the 178th, 292nd, and 268th Infantry Divisions. The remnants of the enemy are fleeing westward in panic. Our army recaptured the city of Yelnya.

International News Service, London, 9th: The Daily Mail published a message from the Swedish capital stating that Marshal Timoshenko urgently dispatched a large army to launch a fierce attack on the German positions in the central line, in order to reduce the terrible pressure from the German army on Marshal Voroshilov in the Leningrad area. Germany urgently dispatched hundreds of dive bombers, which are currently conducting group air raids on the Red Army in the Leningrad area, resulting in a very large air blitz, no less than the battles of Warsaw and Rotterdam.

### Germany Claims Completion of Encirclement of Leningrad; Soviet Defenders Still Receiving Steady Supplies

Reuters, London, 9th: The German side claims to have occupied the city east of Leningrad, completing the encirclement of Leningrad and cutting off all land transportation lines to the city. According to a special statement issued by Hitler's headquarters, the German mobile troops, assisted by aircraft, have advanced to the vanguard positions on the Neva River, 29 miles east of Leningrad, and occupied the city of Shlisselburg on Lake Ladoga. However, this news has not been confirmed by other sources. Moscow is also reporting that the Soviet troops under General Voroshilov, guarding Leningrad, are receiving relief from land and air, with supplies coming in steadily. The German radio station still claims that the Soviet troops in the Leningrad area are putting up a strong resistance, and admits that the Soviet troops are fighting for every inch of land, forcing the German army to switch to the defensive.

### Finnish Troops Advance to the Svir River, Threatening the Soviet Far North's Important Transportation Lines

Reuters, London, 9th: Military commentators say that the statement from the Finnish and German command headquarters that the Finnish troops have advanced to the Svir River (between Lake Onega and Lake Ladoga) appears to threaten the two important supply lines between the Soviet Far North and the west. It has not been stated where exactly the Finnish troops have advanced to the Svir River, nor is their strength clear, but if this statement is true, then the Finnish troops' advance is of no small importance, because the main waterway connecting the White Sea and western Soviet Union, the Stalin Canal, runs along the Svir River, and the railway from Murmansk to the south also passes through the Svir River. In addition to cutting off these transportation lines, the Finnish army is obviously hoping to meet up with the German army east and south of Leningrad, in order to realize the German side's previous boast that Leningrad has been surrounded. However, according to recent news from Moscow, the German army has not yet attacked the east and southeast of Leningrad. Even if the Finnish and German armies are able to meet up, they will not be able to cut off all communication between the Soviet Union's north and the inland, because the northern city of Arkhangelsk still has a good railway running south directly to Moscow. This railway is still 250 miles away from the nearest German troops.

International News Service, Berlin, 9th: A communiqué from Führer Hitler's headquarters stated that the German armored divisions have reached the south shore of Lake Ladoga, only a few miles away from the Finnish troops advancing south.

### German Troops Repeatedly Attempt to Force Crossing of the Dnieper River Without Success; Odessa and Kiev Are Impregnable

Reuters, London, 9th: Moscow's communiqué states that the German army's attempts to break through the Dnieper River defenses have all been defeated. According to news from the besieged city of Odessa, the German troops have attacked the local Soviet navy, army, and people's volunteers for 29 days without success. Odessa is now "impregnable," and Kiev has also become a strong stronghold. All residents have participated in the city's defenses, adding to the fortifications. Moscow newspapers report that General Purtini has concentrated his troops in Ukraine, while the German side says that the German army is preparing to repel the Soviet counteroffensive in this area and around Gomel in the central area.

TASS, Odessa, 9th: Fierce fighting has been going on near the city of Odessa for 19 days. The Nazi army's repeated offensives have been shattered by the heroic resistance of the Red Army Navy and the National Army. Under the heavy blows of the Red Army, the enemy's elite troops have suffered heavy casualties. This besieged city has now become an impregnable Soviet fortress, within sight but out of reach for the enemy.

### Nazis Throw All Their Strength into the Eastern Front War, Deploying 34 Divisions

United Press International, London, 9th: Responsible Allied officials stated yesterday that in the past two weeks the Germans had used 34 divisions to attack the Soviet Union. The Germans had drawn no less than 500,000 soldiers from the occupied territories and Germany, and it was heard that the Soviet army's withdrawal from Tallinn had also allowed the Germans to draw 150,000 soldiers for use elsewhere. It is generally believed that these 150,000 soldiers must have been used to reinforce the offensive on Leningrad, but Voroshilov's troops continue to put up a difficult resistance. However, the German threat to Leningrad has caused the Allied and Soviet officials to become increasingly anxious.

### German Long-Range Gun Shells Dover Port Yesterday; Two Shots Fired Every Few Minutes for Half an Hour; Berlin Heavily Bombed by British Air Force

Reuters, London, 9th. A German long-range gun, positioned on the French coast, shelled the Dover area of England for half an hour last night. This was the first shelling in several weeks. Several houses were damaged. Each time the enemy gun fired, two shells exploded. When the shelling began, Dover immediately issued a shelling alarm. There was a pause of fifteen minutes, after which the enemy gun fired two shells every few minutes, flying high and landing in the Dover area. The sound of the artillery and the explosion of the shells caused houses within miles of the Kent coast to shake. Observers saw red flashes from the enemy gun firing on Cap Gris-Nez on the opposite shore, illuminating the sea. German anti-aircraft batteries in Calais also fired at British bombers in the sky during the shelling. The sound of a German plane was heard flying over the English Channel, presumably directing the German artillery.

Reuters, 9th. According to a public announcement yesterday afternoon by the Air Ministry, the British Air Force bombed Germany on Sunday night, inflicting damage. Targets in Berlin, Kiel, and elsewhere, as well as shipyards in Cologne, were attacked. The British squadron attacking Berlin was particularly effective. The night was bright with moonlight, and a large number of bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped, lasting for two hours. Large fires broke out in many parts of the city, causing significant damage. The shipyards in Kiel and Cologne were also heavily damaged. Four enemy night fighters were destroyed. A total of twenty British bombers were missing.

Reuters, London, 9th. More than one hundred British planes attacked Kassel in western Germany last night and returned safely to base. Kassel is the headquarters of the large Henschel locomotive company and is even more important in the current war against the Soviet Union.

The official communique also stated that the American aircraft mostly bombed non-essential targets. However, the news also said that many Norwegian soldiers were killed by the bombing, and the total number of dead and wounded must be large. Many houses were also destroyed, but the official did not announce the details of the damage.

### War Enters Third Year; New Zealand's Strength Increases; Mobilizing National Manpower and Resources to Help the Motherland Win Victory

Reuters, Wellington, 9th. As the war enters its third year, New Zealand is exceptionally well equipped in terms of both manpower and material resources. There are currently 308,000 people, including those in munitions and factory workers, now participating in war-related services, including 75,000 people serving in the active forces, 138,000 in the home guard, and 95,000 in the civil defense force. With the establishment and training of an army tank brigade and the impending establishment of an armored vehicle school, New Zealand's strength will become even more apparent. The number of New Zealanders serving in the Navy is now more than five times greater than at the outbreak of the war, and there are still about 3,000 waiting to join. More than 400 are currently serving in the Imperial Naval Air Force. The New Zealand Air Force is currently operating with the British Air Force from Iceland to Singapore. A squadron is also stationed on various islands in the Pacific. Although a large amount of manpower has been diverted from industry to war, agricultural and industrial production has shown no signs of decline. Coal miners are currently increasing production by 284,000 tons per year, and gold mining has increased pure gold and silver by 18 percent. Cheese exports have increased by 46 percent over the past two years, and butter production has also increased significantly.

### Delegation Visiting Burma Returns to Chongqing via Mandalay and Lashio; Receives Warm Hospitality from All Sectors

Chongqing. The Chinese delegation visiting Burma returned to Chongqing on the evening of the 8th. The delegation flew to Rangoon from Chongqing on the 28th of last month. During their week-long stay in Rangoon, they received a warm welcome and hospitality from the Burmese government, the Burmese Governor, the Burmese people, and the overseas Chinese. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, they traveled by special flower car from Rangoon to Mandalay and arrived there the next morning. The local authorities and overseas Chinese also held a grand welcoming tea party. On the 7th, they traveled by car to Lashio, where the local magistrate, chieftain, and representatives of the overseas Chinese all welcomed them at the station and held a banquet at the China National Aviation Corporation's hostel. Burmese Governor Dorman-Smith telegraphed his best wishes for a safe journey home. The telegram was delivered in person by the local magistrate of Lashio. At 1:00 PM on the 8th, they left Burma by China National Aviation Corporation plane and returned home, landing safely in Kunming at around 3:00 PM. Delegation leader Chiang Meng-lin, deputy leader Miao Jia-ming, and delegation member Jin Long-zhang disembarked in Kunming. Delegation member Hang Li-wu, who also served as secretary-general, Zhang Wei-zhen, Chen Ji-yi, Tang De-chen, and Zhang Xue-qian, who also served as English secretary, continued to fly to Chongqing, arriving safely at the airport at around 7:00 PM.

After returning to Chongqing, Delegation Secretary-General Hang Li-wu said that the delegation received a warm welcome from all parties in Burma. This enthusiasm is a manifestation of the friendship of the Chinese people, and those who have experienced it are particularly grateful. The ease and sincerity of the Burmese people left a deep impression on people.

### Dissolve Major University; Rectify Academic Morale

Chengdu. At the Provincial Government Memorial Week meeting on the 8th, Provincial Governor Zhang spoke about the student unrest at the Provincial Chongqing University. He briefly mentioned that Chongqing University was founded by the late Chairman Liu and is the only university in the province. In recent years, academic morale has deteriorated day by day. Whenever there is a change of president, students openly welcome or reject the new appointee, and their actions are perverse. In order to rectify academic morale, the government has had to take decisive measures to dissolve the university and appoint Wu Zexiang and others as supervisory committee members to be responsible for the reorganization. The Ministry of Education and the Provincial Government are now jointly planning the aftermath. This measure is a problem of rectification of the entire academic morale, and it is not only an unavoidable measure for Chongqing University alone. It has also been found that only a small number of students participated in this student unrest. Although the government has dissolved Chongqing University and punished the students who caused the trouble, it will still allow the majority of students who did not participate to continue their studies after registration and inspection.

### Chinese Banks Cooperate Wholeheartedly; All Prepare to Engage in Foreign Exchange; China and Jiaotong Banks Plan Implementation Steps; In Fact, Consistent with Allied Banks; September Tentative Measures for Specially Approved Foreign Exchange Banks Published

After the implementation of the Measures for Granting Foreign Exchange for Essential Imports, which were promulgated to manage the Shanghai foreign exchange market, by the concerted efforts of fourteen Allied banks, the long-disordered Shanghai trade situation has obviously returned to normal, and the black market for foreign exchange, which has always been a hotbed of speculation, has also been curbed. However, on the part of Chinese national banks, they have been extremely silent on this matter. However, according to reports from the New Voice Agency yesterday, the China and Jiaotong Banks (the Central and Farmers Banks do not engage in foreign exchange, which is handled centrally by the China and Jiaotong Banks) are preparing to take consistent actions with the fourteen Allied banks, and may apply to the Stabilization Fund on behalf of customers for the foreign exchange of essential goods, while also purchasing export bills of exchange from traders. As for the foreign exchange business of Chinese banks, it was balanced on the 15th of last month, and after the Central Bank took over and settled it clearly, it could not continue to engage in foreign exchange. Now, with the special approval of the Stabilization Fund, the Chinese banks may also apply to the Stabilization Fund for foreign exchange through the China and Jiaotong Banks, and obtain a commission of 0.03125. At this moment, all Chinese banks are negotiating with China and Jiaotong Banks. However, the authorities of the four banks have neither confirmed nor denied the receipt of the order from the Stabilization Fund transferred by the head office. However, in fact, what the four banks are currently doing is completely no different from the measures taken by the fourteen foreign banks in accordance with the order of the Stabilization Fund.

Chinese Banks - Unified Action

The unified action of Chinese national banks and Chinese banks will be evidenced by the announcement of the Stabilization Fund. This announcement was issued the day before yesterday afternoon. In addition to declaring that the purpose of the Stabilization Conference was to meet with representatives of British and American banks to exchange views on the recent developments caused by the British and American government freeze measures, it also emphasized that the British and American banking circles have decided to buy and sell foreign exchange at the Stabilization Fund exchange rate, and all Chinese banks have also promised to cooperate wholeheartedly. The announcement concluded by saying that the methods and understandings agreed upon have made substantial progress, and the British and American financial departments will also make every effort to cooperate so that the Stabilization Fund can obtain news or information related to the British and American government freeze decrees. The US government will also specially dispatch personnel to reside in China and Hong Kong to handle this matter. Yesterday, Chinese and foreign banks in this city expressed their sincere welcome to the Stabilization Fund's resolution and the announcement, and all were determined to abide by the authorities' orders to strengthen the organization and implementation efficiency of foreign exchange management in Shanghai.

Managing the Exchange Market - All Express Support

Because the Chinese banks are also allowed to manage foreign exchange transactions through the China and Jiaotong Banks, they also expressed their support for the implementation of foreign exchange management. The foreign exchange business of Chinese banks was balanced on the 15th of last month, and after the Central Bank took over and settled it clearly, it could no longer buy and sell foreign exchange due to the lack of a special note from the US government. However, according to the new regulations, all Chinese banks can still apply to the Stabilization Fund for legal foreign exchange through the China and Jiaotong Banks on behalf of customers, and obtain the commission of 0.03125 that should have been obtained by the China and Jiaotong Banks. When importers request the supply of foreign exchange from various Chinese banks, they must first fill in the relevant items on the application form, which will be collected by the original handling bank and submitted to China or Jiaotong. China and Jiaotong will fill in the guarantee item and then send it to the Stabilization Fund. In this case, the importer is responsible to the original handling Chinese bank, the Chinese bank is responsible to China and Jiaotong, and China and Jiaotong is responsible to the Stabilization Fund. If the Stabilization Fund subsequently finds that the application does not meet the regulations, but the foreign exchange has been approved, it may order the closest responsible bank to recover the foreign exchange that has been granted.

Arbitrage and Profit-Taking - Impossible to Achieve

With the implementation of the Shanghai foreign exchange management measures, the loopholes in the US and British freeze orders are gradually being filled. Under these conditions, the black market for foreign exchange will naturally disappear, and any arbitrage attempts will be impossible to achieve. This method can obviously prevent the unwarranted outflow of Chinese funds, but it has no impact on legitimate and legal import trade. As for profit-taking, it has always been the focus of attention for speculative merchants, who use the difference between spot and futures or futures of various months to make profits. Now, under the control of the Stabilization Fund, there is naturally no difference in exchange rates. Even the black exchange rate, which currently has a price but no market, is due to the efforts of the Stabilization Fund and various banks. This difference, which gives speculators good opportunities, no longer exists. As for yesterday's black exchange rate, the spot and futures prices for British exchange were 2 pence 859375, and the current futures price for US exchange was 4 yuan 84375. This prohibition of arbitrage and profit-taking will definitely have a stabilizing effect on the entire exchange market.

The Black Market Still Attempts to Survive

The issue of the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange still attracts the attention of many people, and yesterday's rumors that "the black market will be traded by exporters and import firms negotiating a median price" is just an attempt by speculative merchants who attempt to extend the life of the black exchange. However, according to people in related banks, this move is difficult to implement. The reason why the black market is generated is that the buyer is sucking in from the importers, and the seller is throwing out from the exporters. Now, on the one hand, the Stabilization Fund stipulates that foreign exchange is supplied for the import of essential goods or small trade, so there is no need for importers to suck in from the black market again. On the other hand, it is stipulated that exporters must sell their export bills of exchange to any one of the fourteen Allied banks and the China and Jiaotong Banks, otherwise they will be refused foreign exchange for import. Therefore, in order to maintain the right to obtain foreign exchange from the Stabilization Fund when importing, exporters are naturally unwilling to throw out their export bills of exchange to the black market. For this reason, the curbing and elimination of the black market is extremely reasonable, and the random release of rumors by general speculators only shows that their efforts are increasingly exhausted. However, the situation in Shanghai is special. How to settle the foreign exchange for the import of prohibited goods and non-essential luxury goods in the future is another matter. This is different in nature from the speculative behavior of the black market for foreign exchange in the past, and since there is a standard for legal foreign exchange, it is difficult to deviate from the norm.

Hawkins and Mackay Return to Shanghai Today

Hawkins, General Manager of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and Mackay, Supervisor of Citibank, who went to Hong Kong from Shanghai to participate in the Stabilization Conference, have completed the conference in Hong Kong and returned to Shanghai on the American President Lines' President Cleveland. They are expected to arrive here this morning. Mr. Hawkins is the Chairman of the Shanghai Foreign Banks Association. This decision was made to go to Hong Kong to represent the foreign banks to express their opinions and promise to buy and sell foreign exchange at the Stabilization Fund exchange rate, which is welcomed by all parties. Mr. Mackay is the leader of the American banks and also has considerable influence. The two men will return to Shanghai together, which will undoubtedly make a more practical contribution to the Shanghai exchange market. As for Dr. Taylor, the American assistant of the Stabilization Fund, who went to Hong Kong before the two men, and Hall-Patch, the British commissioner who left Shanghai after the two men, they will not come to Shanghai in the short term because they still have to stay in Hong Kong to discuss various issues with American Commissioner Fox.

Tentative Measures - Reportedly Promulgated

It is reported that the Stabilization Fund Committee yesterday authorized the Chartered Bank to issue the "September Tentative Measures for Specially Approved Foreign Exchange Banks." It details the methods for approving foreign exchange to importers and individuals applying for foreign exchange. The measures also contain the list of two items announced on Monday. The import of these items can be applied for a limited amount of US exchange or British exchange from the Stabilization Fund by specially approved or licensed banks in this city. The tentative measures contain a clause stipulating that each bank shall settle foreign exchange only at the legal exchange rate and shall not directly or indirectly engage in the buying and selling of other exchange rates. The items listed in the measures, List A, stipulate that food rice, tobacco leaves, petroleum products, and coal are subject to certain restrictions, limited to the amount needed in this city. List B contains many items (annotated with the 1934 Customs Import Tariff Number), including cotton, cotton yarn and thread, wool and wool waste, electrical machinery for transmission and power generation, milk and cheese, and flour and grain products. Although there are hundreds of items included in List B that can be applied for foreign exchange at the legal exchange rate, according to a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency who met with a member of the banking community yesterday, it is said that there are countless items that are not included in the list, and their continued import is related to the prosperity of Shanghai's industry and commerce. In addition, checks that expire in September and have not yet been settled may be supplied with foreign exchange, but special foreign currency guarantees held by banks and importers are not included. The supply of foreign exchange should be reported to the Stabilization Fund.

### American Businesses Close for Half a Day Today; Mourn Mrs. Roosevelt; American Chamber of Commerce Issued a Notice Last Night

The funeral will be held on the fixed day and she will be buried in the cemetery of St. James' Church in the park, which is also the burial place of President Roosevelt's father. The American Chamber of Commerce in this city issued a notice to its members last night to close for half a day this afternoon to show their condolences.

### Public Works Department Discusses Supplementing; Coal Needed by Factories; If There is a Clue, It Can Be Shipped in One and a Half Months; Electricity Surcharge Can Also Be Cancelled at That Time

The English-language Da Mei Evening News stated that if Shanghai can obtain a sufficient amount of bituminous coal from North China to supplement the current annual shortage of 600,000 to 700,000 tons, the major issue of the rising cost of living in this city can be satisfactorily resolved. It is now disclosed that the issue of shipping more coal into Shanghai is currently being discussed by the Public Works Department and the Japanese side.

The Electricity Company is Also Negotiating

The Shanghai Power Company has also negotiated with the Japanese side in the hope of obtaining a sufficient amount of bituminous coal for power generation, but has not yet received a reply. However, it is believed that the Japanese military and naval authorities are now planning to take some steps in this regard. If the Japanese authorities allow Shanghai to ship in enough coal, it will greatly reduce electricity bills, which will benefit all manufacturers greatly, and the high prices of goods are also expected to fall back together. According to responsible parties,

The Amount of Coal Needed is Limited

Even if half of the coal that Shanghai lacks each year, that is, 300,000 to 400,000 tons, is shipped in, the situation can be greatly improved, and general prices will almost certainly fall accordingly. The amount of coal currently shipped into Shanghai is about 2 million tons per year, which is about 500,000 tons less than the amount needed. The Shanghai Power Company was previously able to supply its own coal for power generation, but in the past eight months, it has been difficult to obtain a normal amount of coal, so coal consumption has had to be reduced. If the company can obtain more coal, there is hope of reducing or eliminating the current electricity surcharge, and manufacturers will benefit from cheaper electricity, and the cost of the goods they produce will also be reduced, which will be beneficial in all aspects. Even Japanese-owned spinning mills and factories here, although they have found ways to obtain the coal they need from a certain direction, will also benefit from the reduction in electricity bills.

The Coal Can be Shipped in One and a Half Months

It is heard that a major difficulty in Shanghai's acquisition of more coal is the current shortage of ships. However, if the Japanese authorities decide to cooperate in the difficulties currently encountered in Shanghai, there are still ships that can be allocated to transport coal to Shanghai. If so, as long as ships with a load of 8,000 tons are dedicated to transporting coal to Shanghai, 400,000 tons of coal can be transported in one and a half months. As for household coal for this winter, it is heard that all parties have not yet taken steps to remedy the situation. The Kailan Mining Administration and the Hongji Coal Company are currently shipping coal to Shanghai on schedule, but it is not known whether they will be able to obtain a sufficient amount of coal to meet the household needs of the city.

### Telephone Company Expands Telephones; New Users Please Install Telephones; Lines Can Be Connected Next Month

The Shanghai Telephone Company of the Public Concession has greatly increased its business revenue since increasing the connection fee. However, due to the insufficient allocation of the original lines, and the abnormal prosperity of the households, the demand for telephones from various industries has increased. However, due to the war, raw materials have not been able to be replenished, so all plans have not been able to be realized. Now, the company has shipped some materials to Shanghai, so the company has specially expanded the connection stations of "No. 1," "No. 7," "No. 8," "No. 9," "No. 3," and "No. 6." At the same time, it is also actively laying overhead cables. Once completed, they will be installed separately according to the order of the user's request to facilitate the application of citizens. All projects are generally expected to be completed in the next month.

### President Cleveland Arrives in Shanghai This Afternoon

According to shipping industry news, several large American President Lines ships will arrive in Shanghai one after another in the next ten days. It is heard that the President Cleveland will sail from Manila to Shanghai this morning. The ship has a large amount of American crushed wheat and is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for one night and leave Shanghai on the 11th. It is learned that there will be 150 American expatriates, most of whom recently evacuated from Japan on the Ryuta Maru, who will take the ship back to the United States. In addition, Hal Reynolds, secretary of the American YMCA, will also return to the United States. It is also learned that the US government is still adhering to its consistent policy on the expatriation work in the Far East, and all expatriates who return to their home countries are still those who voluntarily leave.

### Reduction of Water Charges for Boiled Water Shops is Under Discussion

The Boiled Water Shop Industry Association continued to petition the Public Works Department of the Public Concession at 2:00 PM yesterday, requesting that the water company be instructed to provide preferential water supply or change the calculation method. The representative of the authorities agreed to try their best to find a solution and asked them to wait for orders and consult with the water company. All representatives then left.

Comparison of Water Charges

The charges of the French Water Company have always been cheaper than those of the British Water Company. Before September 6, 1939, it only charged 8 fen and 7 li (silver calculation) per degree (ie one cubic meter). After September 6 of the same year, the above price was increased by 10%. After November 6 of the same year, it was increased by another 30%. After January 26, 1941, the price was increased by 49%. After April 26, 1941, the price was increased by 75%. The current charge is 3 jiao and 2 fen per cubic meter, which is significantly different from the charges of the British Water Company. Therefore, it is hoped that the British Water Company's charges for boiled water shops will also be charged according to the company's charging method.

Ping Coal Sale

Ping coal used by boiled water shops has now been agreed upon by the Kailan Mining Administration, and it has been decided to sell the remaining 300 tons of No. 3 coal slag at a flat price. Each household is limited to half a ton, and each ton is sold for 100 yuan in national currency, which is 20 yuan more than before. It has now been set to begin selling from (1) bathhouses on the 12th, (2) boiled water shops from the 13th to the 15th.

### US Court Marshal Thai Kiao Pang Accused of Stealing and Selling Public Property; Prosecutor Hills Officially Indicts; Detective Testifies at Continued Trial

The English-language "China Press" reports that Special Marshal Rudun of the U.S. Court for China held a hearing today (the 9th) to investigate the case of Thai Tuo Pang, the former Deputy Executive Officer of the court, for stealing and selling public property. The defendant, Thai Tuo Pang, was escorted to the court by two police officers from the Police Department. He looked pale and quite uneasy, and smiled bitterly at his lawyer, Copts. Prosecutor Hills, representing the U.S. government, accused the defendant of stealing and selling public property.

Breach of Trust

It was stated that the defendant, while temporarily replacing the Executive Officer Li Quesun during his absence from Shanghai, had the authority to sign salary checks for court personnel and to safeguard public firearms and ammunition. He then took the opportunity to privately take two Colt .18-caliber handguns and 300 rounds of ammunition to a friend's house at 91 Dianmi Road, to discuss selling them. His friend then took the guns and ammunition and sold them to a Chinese person for 4,400 yuan in Chinese currency, all in cash, including some hundred-yuan notes. The defendant received 3,400 yuan.

Selling Firearms Illegally

He then returned to the court to get ammunition to give to his friend. This ammunition was also part of the transaction. It was decided that the defendant would deposit the money into his personal account at Citibank, but the bank did not accept hundred-yuan notes. The defendant also accompanied another person in an official car to Dianmi Road and then went elsewhere before returning to the Hui Zhong Hotel. According to the inventory list of the Executive Officer's office, the defendant stole and sold a total of eight firearms.

Heavy Debt

The defendant was already heavily in debt when he joined the court and became increasingly mired in it. This was the motive for his theft and sale of firearms. Therefore, the court should find the defendant guilty. The defendant's lawyer, Copts, continued to claim that he would defend the defendant at the next hearing. The prosecutor then called Wal, a detective from the Shanghai Municipal Police, to testify. Wal stated that among the nine handguns registered at the Ziccawei station, he recognized one as belonging to the U.S. Court.

Detective's Testimony

He reported this to the Deputy Director of the Police Department and then went to the court to meet with Executive Officer Li Quesun. Since Li had left Shanghai, he met with Thai Tuo Pang. The defendant initially pretended to investigate, then said the next day that he had given the gun to a Chinese person and asked him to keep it secret. Later, the defendant said that he needed more time. The aforementioned details are all from [his testimony]. After the evidence was presented, the judge announced a continuance for further hearing.

### Swedish Sailors Sail in Rowboat Across Pacific Ocean

The "North China Daily News" reports that a type of yacht, the "Ella," often participates in rowing races held by the Shanghai Rowing Club on the Huangpu River. Last Sunday, it was suddenly seen leaving the Wusong estuary and sailing down the Yangtze River. It is said to be heading to Manila. The boat flies the Swedish flag and is crewed by three Swedish sailors. They hope to eventually cross the Pacific Ocean, with San Francisco as their final destination. Rowing experts in Shanghai believe that the Swedish sailors' courageous attempt to sail a yacht across the ocean is extremely dangerous and requires luck to reach Manila safely. It cannot be achieved solely through navigational skills. The final attempt to cross the entire Pacific Ocean is extremely perilous.

### Central Police Detective Yamaguchi Suddenly Attacked; Shot on Tram, Bullet Enters Abdomen, Seriously Injured

Yesterday morning, a shooting incident occurred at the tram stop near the Jade Buddha Temple at Route Gordon and Rue Pingliang in the Public Concession. The victim was Yamaguchi, a Japanese detective with the Public Concession Police Department. He was shot in the back, and the bullet penetrated his abdomen. His life is in critical condition. The details of the shooting are as follows:

Serving for Many Years, Promoted to Detective

Yamaguchi, Japanese badge number 611 of the Public Concession Municipal Police Department, is about 40 years old. He previously served at the Route Gordon Police Station in the Western District and was later transferred to the Central Police Station on Foochow Road, where he was responsible for criminal cases involving Japanese residents. He is fluent in Chinese and English and resides in the Guangming Village on Route Gordon. Recently, he was promoted to detective (探目) due to his success in handling cases. He routinely commuted to the police station by tram.

Waiting at the Station, Suddenly Attacked

At 8:40 a.m. yesterday, Yamaguchi finished breakfast at home, wearing a gray suit. He walked to the tram station near the Jade Buddha Temple on Route Gordon and Rue Pingliang to wait for the tram to go to the police station. Unexpectedly, there were five men lying in wait. One of them suddenly opened fire on Yamaguchi's back, firing three shots in an attempt to assassinate him. Yamaguchi was caught off guard, and a bullet penetrated his abdomen, causing him to collapse in a pool of blood with serious injuries.

Bullet Not Removed, Life in Grave Danger

After the police station received the news, they sent Chinese and Western detectives to the scene. The assassin had disappeared. An ambulance was used to send him to Fumin Hospital for treatment. The hospital sent him to Ward 1, a first-class ward on the fourth floor, and used X-rays to locate the bullet. They discovered that it was still lodged in his abdomen, making it extremely difficult to remove. Therefore, Yamaguchi's life is in extreme danger. The police station is currently investigating the details of the case. The recovered bullet casings have also been examined by specialists for clues.

### Shui On Lane, Route D'aghion; Landlord Cuts Off Water; Sues for Eviction After Years of Litigation; Selling in Sections Forces Tenants to Leave

The entire property of Shui On Lane, Route D'aghion in the Public Concession, originally named Wenxiang Lane, was taken over by the landlord Wai Yan Tong (懷仁堂) in September of last year and renamed. It immediately appointed lawyer Lu Qi to sue all the tenants in the First Special District Court in the name of recovering the property for their own use, requesting a court order for eviction. The litigation has been ongoing for nearly a year. The landlord, knowing they were in the wrong, withdrew the original lawsuit from the court. However, in August of this year, they still hired a lawyer to publish advertisements in the newspapers, offering the houses in Shui On Lane for sale in sections. After advertising in various newspapers, the houses were quickly sold out. However, the new owners, unable to move in immediately, negotiated with the former landlord, Wai Yan Tong. Wai Yan Tong, disregarding the livelihoods of the residents, cut off the water supply to the entire lane on the morning of the 4th of this month, and it has been six days. All the tenants are complaining incessantly. Yesterday afternoon, the tenants held a public meeting and decided to, in addition to appealing to the police and various sectors of society to uphold justice, appoint Tao Zaiming as their chief representative and hire lawyer Ge Zhitan as their legal counsel to seek legal protection and demand that the landlord Wai Yan Tong restore the water supply to protect public life.

### Japanese Soldiers Chase a Man, Escapes at Last, Drops a Cigarette Can, Turns Out to be a Bomb

At 9:20 p.m. last night, two Japanese military police officers were patrolling on East and West Seward Road in Hongkou when they saw a man in front of them wearing a long gown, in his twenties, walking slowly and acting suspiciously. They intended to go forward to search him, but the man noticed them and immediately ran away. The Japanese military police officers pursued him closely. While chasing him to the vicinity of Laojie on Yuanfang Road, a lead cigarette can suddenly fell from the man's gown onto the road. The Japanese military police officers picked it up and examined it. They realized that it was a homemade bomb and were greatly shocked. They continued to pursue him, but the man had disappeared. Afterwards, the Japanese sealed off the bridges over the Suzhou Creek and conducted a thorough search in the vicinity of the incident, but found nothing. It is said that the bridges were opened at midnight.

### Dismissed Chinese Constable Turns to Banditry

A certain surname family, resident at 4 Wen Yuan Fang, Pi Sao Nai Road outside the Little North Gate of the French Concession, is a rice merchant whose family has been accumulating a considerable amount of wealth and caused bandits to salivate at the mouth. At 10 p.m. the night before, suddenly four or five bandits broke in, holding handguns, and robbed them of more than 2,000 yuan in cash and a gold watch. As the bandits were fleeing with their loot, the victim followed behind them. At the intersection of Min Ti Ni Yin Road, a detective named Shen Lianfang happened to be passing by and received the victim's report. He stepped forward and caught one of the bandits, seizing a handgun. The bandit confessed that his last name was Jin, and that he had previously been a patrolman in a certain unit of the French police force, but that he had now turned to banditry. Later, three more accomplices were apprehended in the Zaojiao Du area in Western Shanghai and taken back to the police station for investigation and prosecution.

### Orphanage Hosting Tea Dance Fundraiser, To Be Held on the 14th of This Month at the Lido Ballroom

The Shanghai Orphanage has been established for nearly four years. Since Mr. Gao Huailiang took over as director in March of this year, he has been determined to innovate and actively reorganize, so that the affairs of the hospital have been improving day by day.

At that time, the fragrance of clothes and hairpins will make it a grand occasion.

### Grain: Permission to Supply Foreign Rice with Foreign Exchange Unexpectedly Becomes Pretext for Price Increase; Rice Merchants' Intentions Truly Unpredictable

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice initially rose and then fell, and the market price was seen to be consolidating again. The market opened in the morning carrying the upward trend from the previous day, and buying interest was very strong. This is because rice merchants always want prices to rise. The government has agreed to provide foreign exchange for the purchase of foreign rice for Shanghai, originally for the sake of the people's food supply, not to make the rice merchants rich. With this assistance, it would have been possible to stabilize public sentiment and level out grain prices. However, the rice merchants took this as an excuse to raise prices, arguing that even if all approvals were granted, only 150,000 to 200,000 bags could be obtained. Regardless of whether their calculations are accurate, it should be known that with this new order of 200,000 bags per month, plus the nearly 2 million bags of rice in stock, and the new rice that will be entering the market successively, there is more than enough. Logically speaking, in the next six months, there will be no need to order 100,000 to 200,000 bags of rice per month. Therefore, if the rice merchants make various excuses, the foreign exchange that is approved for supply can be used exclusively for ordering publicly sold rice. However, the rice merchants yesterday used the excuse that the approved foreign exchange was insufficient to purchase rice, seizing the opportunity to stir up trouble. The rice price surged again, and prices rose speculatively. The "football" momentum was greatly boosted, and the market price was immediately kicked up by three or four yuan. English and Chinese warehouses on Xiaojia Road were priced at 137.56 yuan, and spot prices were about 132 to 133.5 yuan. Broken rice was priced at 95.70 to 96 yuan for large quantities, and 97 to 97.5 yuan for high-quality rice, making it more sought after than spot rice. The small quantity of English and Chinese rice had already risen the night before, and in the morning, it opened at 110.05 yuan from 108 yuan. Other goods followed suit. However, as the price was high, those who had profits took them, and the market price fell again by one or two yuan in the afternoon due to the favorable situation for the United States in the Far East, which was very unfavorable to the bullish side. In the end, it only increased by one to three yuan. The number of transactions increased to nearly 30,000 bags, or 800 to 900 tons.

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel arrived at the port the day before yesterday (the 8th) in the evening, carrying 2,070 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and unloaded at the company's pier on the Bund in the French Concession. Jardine Matheson's Fao Seng Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying 2,568 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and unloaded at the Roosevelt Pier. In addition to transporting a small amount of foreign rice, Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel will transport a large batch of foreign rice to Qingdao today. The city will also load an additional 1,500 bags for Qingdao. (Zu)

The local market for thick and thin japonica rice (粳米) also saw increased activity. The arrival of goods is still limited, so the price has increased by one or two yuan due to the cargo owner's reluctance to sell. Early indica rice (早稻) from Guannan Port opened at 153.5 yuan, but was finalized at 150 yuan. Wuxi white japonica rice was 150 yuan, and Pudong new japonica rice was 153 yuan.

The source of glutinous rice has been scarce recently. In addition to the surge in foreign rice, both buyers and sellers have a bullish attitude. As the sporadic demand is quite good, with large buyers absorbing the supply every day, those holding goods are also shouting aggressively. As a result, the market price has increased by one to three yuan. The Zhente Tuanli sold for up to 129 yuan, the average quality opened high from 126 to 127 yuan, and was finalized at 113 yuan, Zhongguan was 121 yuan, and Glutinous Tea was 113 to 114 yuan.

### Flour Riding High to Sell Back Out; Batch of Canadian Wheat Being Negotiated

The market for foreign flour was stimulated by rumors in the early market, raising prices by three to five cents. It was said that although the price of foreign flour had been agreed upon, it could not be finalized due to the inability to settle foreign exchange. Speculators took the opportunity to become active. Jinlong West Warehouse opened at 31.5 yuan and rose to 31.7 yuan, East Warehouse rose from 31.95 yuan to 32.2 yuan, and the Pao Tai rose to 33.23 yuan. However, in the flourishing market, there were those who took profits and sold back out, so the market had already stabilized by noon. Then, because of the spread of peaceful talk, which was unfavorable to the bullish side, market sentiment softened again, and selling interest increased again. The market could not withstand it and fell again. Moreover, although there were no firm orders for foreign flour, the price of foreign wheat was decreasing, and foreign merchants had a guarantee of handling foreign exchange, and it was also rumored that a batch of Canadian wheat was being negotiated. Therefore, the Pao Tai American flour fell to a closing price of 32.85 yuan, Jinlong East Warehouse was 31.8 yuan, and West Warehouse was 21.3 yuan, all similar to the previous close. Local flour also had 200 to 300 bags, opening at 34.12 yuan. The number of transactions in foreign flour was more than 30,000 bags.

### Oilseed Cake: Qingdao Crude Oil; Direct Deals Heard

Yesterday, the price of edible oil fell sharply. The actual sales were still slow, and there were still a few sources arriving at the port. In addition, rumors were unfavorable, causing many people to sell, so the price could not withstand the downward trend. As a result, rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil fell sharply by seven or eight yuan compared to the previous day. A total of more than 6,000 dan of Ta You brand refined oil for delivery in September were sold on the unified market, priced at 178 to 173 yuan. In addition, more than 4,000 barrels of rapeseed oil from the Rihua factory were sold, priced at 179 to 172 yuan. It was heard that there were direct transactions in Qingdao crude oil, with varying prices. It was also rumored that a certain party had taken in a large quantity of rapeseed oil, priced at 170 yuan.

On the 10th, 615 bags of soybeans were exported, transported to Hong Kong, and 300 bags were transported to Singapore. Another 180 bags of sesame seeds were transported to Hong Kong.

### Finance: Gangs of Merchants Are Rising to Activity; Cash Fluctuations Day by Day

Due to the selling by gold shops, remittance shops, and securities shops, the price only ranged from 13 yuan high or low, ending at 5 yuan. The total volume of transactions did not reach 1,000 taels. The cash market was strong, exceeding 1,000 taels, first rising sharply and then falling, because Hong Kong gold was reported to be small. Hong Kong, Tianjin, Chaozhou and other gangs of merchants were rising to activity, causing the fluctuations to be even greater. In the morning, starting with Cheng Ji selling 20 taels to De Fu, priced at 9,200 yuan, the price immediately rose by 10 yuan. De Fu then bought 60 taels from the gold shop, for 9,235 yuan.

Cheng Ji sold 10 taels to Tian Yuan, for 9,300 yuan, and then sold 10 taels, and Dafeng sold 20 taels, all bought by Zhongxing, for 9,290 yuan.

According to an unconfirmed rumour, a certain foreign bank had sold spot U.S. dollars for 4.875 yuan, which was purchased by an unofficial import and export company, or on behalf of Chinese merchants speculators. Enquiries to HSBC, Citibank and other banks refused to quote. Brokers gradually became cold.

#### Buying on Dips, Selling on Rallies; Yarn Market Still Rides the Waves; Futures Especially Chaotic, Near Months Up, Far Months Down

The yarn market initially rose, then leveled off, but yarn prices remain high due to raw material issues and the relatively stable prices of mixed-brand yarns, fostering positive sentiment. However, actual transactions have not seen significant growth. News suggests strong demand from Southeast Asia, boosting cotton cloth transactions. Some also say factories may further reduce production, encouraging well-funded entities to continue buying on dips. After several days of substantial gains, today's opening was high, prompting profit-takers to sell, causing the market to quickly decline. Nonetheless, cotton yarn fundamentals remain solid. 20-count Double Horse yarn traded at a high of $1772 and a low of $1742. Afternoon trading started at $1746, gradually rising to $1758 before closing slightly lower at $1751. The yarn market may now consolidate. Trading volume on the exchange improved in the afternoon, with cotton cloth up $0.14 and yarn for distant delivery up $9. Today, 875 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse futures opened strong, continuing the upward momentum from the previous afternoon, with robust buying interest. The opening price was $1765, subsequently rising to $1769 due to short covering. However, profit-takers mostly sold off, causing the price to drop to $1753-54. News of a small opening on the exchange and a sharp rise in cotton cloth prices reignited market enthusiasm, with buyers rushing in, pushing the price to $1772. Later, as the exchange market declined and short sellers became active again, selling pressure increased, causing a sharp drop to $1742. However, major players entered the market on the dips, pushing the price back up to $1752 at closing. Trading volume for the half-day totaled 8010 bales. The quantities purchased by various trading groups are listed below:

Hong Kong: 60 Tongxing: 8,000

Total: 8,060

The Jinbian Double Horse futures market was chaotic, lacking the upward momentum of the previous day. Despite continued progress in U.S. cotton, the futures market was volatile due to rumors and speculation on the exchange, causing near-month and far-month contracts to fluctuate rapidly. In the morning, factory orders initially rose on the strength of foreign cotton, driving up futures prices with ample buying interest. September contracts rose sharply by $15 to $1655. However, midway through trading, negative rumors caused a sudden downturn in factory orders, weakening futures prices. October contracts opened at $1665, down $6.50, before rebounding as retail investors bought on the dips. November contracts opened at $1695, a slight increase of $2. Later, prices fluctuated erratically. Near-month contracts rose at the afternoon close, while far-month contracts weakened. Afternoon trading remained indecisive, with trading groups largely influenced by factory order shifts, resulting in mixed performance. The high and low prices for the day varied between $15 and $25. As a result, September contracts closed at $1653, up $13, while October contracts closed at $162, down $9, and November contracts closed at $1681, a slight increase of $2. The market prices are listed below:

### Continuous Rain and Wind Will Greatly Diminish the New Cotton Crop

The spot cotton market has suddenly become active. Recent weather conditions, with frequent wind and rain and the previous month's storms, have severely damaged the cotton crop in the suburbs of the city. As a result, the public anticipates that raw cotton will become increasingly scarce and expensive. Combined with low inventories, although factories have no plans to act, holders of goods are quite firm in their intentions. In addition, foreign cotton prices continue to reach new highs, leading to a relatively active Indian cotton trading yesterday among industry participants. The transactions of various firms are listed below:

White Rock Removal: $407.00 for 100 bales, spot transaction

U.S. Peng Japa: $38.00

300 bales

Temit Ling: $760.00 for 100 bales, also

Firewood Machine Frame: $310.00 for 150 bales, also

Golan Palace: $339.00 for 100 bales, also

Also

$340.00 for 100 bales, also

Also

$342.00 for 100 bales, also

Golan Palace

$330.00 for 100 bales, also

Also

$334.00 for 100 bales, also

Also

$334.50 for 9 bales

Also

Also

$334.00 for 100 bales, also

$334.00 for 100 bales, also

Although trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai remains enthusiastic due to the firm rise in overseas cotton markets and the increase in spot yarn prices in the city, the inability to settle U.S. dollar exchanges is currently limiting transactions, effectively bringing them to a standstill. Apart from small spot cotton transactions, forward transactions are highly anticipated by the public, urgently requiring a solution to the foreign exchange issue to facilitate U.S. cotton purchases by all parties. If this issue is not resolved promptly or without concrete protection measures, it will significantly impact the future of the entire cotton market.

The New York cotton market initially fell due to a government report favoring short sellers, but subsequently rebounded as domestic supplies remained scarce and industry participants and speculators continued to buy. As a result, yesterday's closing prices were up by 25 to 26 points.

A New York dispatch on the same day stated that the U.S. government's second cotton crop report estimates 10,710,000 bales, a decrease of 107,000 bales from August.

The Indian market is quiet with limited trading. Yesterday's closing prices rose slightly by one rupee. The opening market conditions today are expected to be high due to the frequent rises in U.S. cotton, anticipating a rise of three and a half rupees.

### Securities

#### Type B Bonds Calculated After Lottery; Other Bonds Show Mixed Performance

The over-the-counter market for public bonds continued its struggle, showing little upward momentum. However, buying interest emerged on small dips, making it difficult for prices to fall significantly. While trading volume remained low, prices were relatively stable. The 12th lottery for Type B bonds was held today, drawing a total of 30 winning numbers, one more than the previous draw. As a result, yesterday afternoon's market prices were calculated after deducting the lottery rights, which were valued at approximately $0.60-0.70. In the morning, Type C bonds opened at $71.20, with Yongchang Xinfeng and Lü selling on the market. Runli Lianyi's buying interest was weak, causing Type C bonds to fall below the $1.00 mark. In the afternoon, due to the deduction of rights for Type B bonds, followed by the lottery for Type C bonds, demand for Type C bonds increased. Type C bonds opened up by $0.30, reaching a high of $1.20, with Lianyi Lianhe buying, Runli re-emerging, and Tongkang Runde releasing slightly. The market ultimately showed mixed performance, with Type A and C bonds up $0.02 and $0.05, respectively, and Type E bonds down slightly by $0.05. Type D bonds did not trade at all during the day. Type B bonds, after deducting lottery rights, were down $0.085. The total trading volume was $1.45 million. A simplified table is listed below:

In stock trading, 100 shares of Wing On Company were traded at a price of $26.25 per share.

Public industrial stocks continued to be active, while rubber stock trading was relatively scarce. Market conditions at the opening were stable, with prices showing slight fluctuations. The closing trend was upward. Shanghai Woolen opened at $7.30, rising sharply to $7.90. China Textile also rose gradually from $14.40 to $15.10.

London, 8th (Monday): Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British commercial company stocks remain flat. Only HSBC Bank's UK-registered shares fell by one pound to 77 pounds, with no other changes.

### Sugar Market

#### Sugar Trading Active in Both Spot and Futures Markets

Yesterday, buying interest in the sugar market remained strong, continuing to rise. According to the guild's assessment, spot prices for 24/7 coarse white sugar imported in July were $137.20 and $136, up $2.50. June was $137 and $135.40. May was $135. Dutch Red Road goods were $124, up $3. Taikoo White B Mark was $164.40, up $3.20. HX Mark was $145, up $2. Company futures for 24/7 coarse white sugar for delivery on the 20th of the month were $136, $139, $134.80, $136, $135.60. The 30th was $140, $141.50, $137, $138.50, $137.60. A total of over 55,000 bags of futures were traded, with over 7,000 bags of spot goods. There were both imports and exports of sugar. On the 9th, 13,438 bags were shipped from Hong Kong, and on the 10th, 2,500 bags were shipped to Qingdao.

### Suspension of Black Market Exchange Transactions

- Yugong

Black market exchange transactions, which have been around for the past four or five years, have been painstakingly maintained to meet the needs of 20-30% of the market, at an excessive cost to the country's economy and the people's livelihood. However, the response to this maintenance has created a speculative mentality among the majority of 60-70% of the people. As a result of speculation, prices have soared, and people's livelihood has become more difficult. Yesterday's order from the Stabilization Fund Committee, restricting all foreign banks from engaging in black market foreign exchange trading, can also be said to have been prompted by speculators.

The legitimate foreign exchange needs are strictly reviewed and continue to be supplied, which is both necessary and essential. Here, we hope that the procedures must be taken seriously and the loopholes must be carefully plugged.

International trade cannot exist without the payment of foreign exchange. However, at this time, people should no longer enjoy a rich supply of imported consumer goods. Now, the suspension of black market foreign exchange has been prompted by the lavish spending of consumers of imported goods.

The Shanghai business community should recognize today that this order to suspend black market foreign exchange is both an opportunity to promote the sale of domestic products, not an opportunity to raise prices, and an indication that imported consumer goods should no longer be rampant in the market. With these two inevitable results, our business community should know the direction of their future efforts.

### Commemorating Mr. Wang Fulai - Funeral Service Held on the 7th

- Chen Hezhang

I learned that I first met the long-admired Mr. Wang Fulai in the fall of 1937 at a board meeting of a company I served.

Last spring, I was writing an article on the Shanghai textile industry and, together with a friend, co-edited the "Wartime Economic History of China," and wanted to consult some economic data. So, one morning, I visited Mr. Wang at the Bank of China. He received me very kindly.

Later, I planned to visit him again, but he was ill. I later learned that he was suffering from accumulated fatigue and was resting at Glough Hospital. Due to my usual worldly constraints, I delayed my visit. A few days later, I suddenly saw an obituary in the newspaper. Mr. Wang had passed away on December 2nd. What a loss!

Mr. Wang devoted his life to the textile industry and made outstanding achievements. His life's work, even in tens of thousands of words, cannot be described in detail. Now, I will give a brief account to inspire people to admire him.

In his early years, Mr. Wang studied on a government scholarship at the Tokyo Higher Technical School in Japan, majoring in textile engineering. After returning to China, he was employed by the Shanghai Hengfeng Textile Factory. Later, he served as the chief engineer and factory manager of the Dachina Yarn Factory, the Wuxi Shenxin No. 3 Factory, and the Shanghai Shenxin No. 2 Factory. Later, he was entrusted to reorganize the Dingxin Yarn Factory managed by the Bank of China. Through his planning, remarkable results were achieved, and his reputation grew daily. He was entrusted by state agencies and official commercial banks. In 1935, he transferred to the Business Audit Department of the Bank of China's General Management Office, presiding over cotton industry investment and promoting the factory affairs of the bank's related factories. The following year, he also served as the deputy general manager of the China Cotton Industry Company. From this point on, Mr. Wang's position became even higher, and his word was decisive in the establishment of new factories or the reform of old factories. Mr. Wang was truly a pioneer in the textile industry, holding the reins of this field.

What is even more commendable is that Mr. Wang has thousands of disciples, and today, the backbone of textile factories across the country has been trained by him. In his spare time, Mr. Wang often wrote articles and published them in newspapers and magazines. His upright and insightful remarks were admired by the world. The country's loss of such a virtuous and capable person is a great loss. But Mr. Wang's spirit will always remain in the world and will last forever.

Finally, I wrote a funeral couplet as a commemoration. The couplet reads: "His legacy lies in the people's livelihood, and his praises spread throughout the world. His great writings are translated, and his academic teachings are transmitted to the East Sea."

### Begonia

- Qin Shouou

Twelve. Unexpected Storm

"News, I really don't know when the news will come." He closed the door, retreated inside, and sat listlessly.

However, the news did not come as slowly as he had hoped; it was just not good news.

The day after Xiao Gouzi and Chen Da left, the postman sent a express letter written by the headmaster Fang of the county junior high school, informing him that Mei Bao was missing. The last paragraph said:

"...Because Shang's friend Liu is highly suspected, the Public Security Bureau has summoned him three times for questioning, but without result. Your relative, Mr. Zhang, is temporarily staying in our school's gatehouse, searching outside every day with a picture of your daughter, asking around. Although there are still no clues, his kindness is truly appreciated. Perhaps this will lead to information about your daughter's whereabouts, which is not certain..."

Begonia had never believed in gods, Buddhas, or any religion, but after reading this letter, he couldn't help but kneel down to the sky.

"God! Have mercy on us!" He knelt on the brick floor, praying softly. - Of course, he wouldn't start with some "cry" like he did when acting on stage. - "Xiao Gouzi's legs must be broken running; my heart is about to break too. I haven't really done anything terrible, please let my daughter come back safely..."

From that day on, he prayed like this almost every day. But the more he prayed, the more depressing the news became. For a full week, he did not receive any more letters from Headmaster Fang. (207)

### A Sincere Appeal from a Scholarship Recipient

Mr. Editor:

Unfortunately, due to my family's poverty, I came to Shanghai after graduating from elementary school and secured a position as an apprentice in a bookstore.

I have been at the bookstore for six years now. However, I am still just a delivery and packing errand boy. Undoubtedly, this is due to the impact of the war; but the main reason is still that I myself lack sufficient knowledge and cannot manage complex and more difficult tasks.

"You regret not studying when the time comes to use what you've learned" is truly a profound saying. Because I lack education, I suffer losses everywhere, so I feel the importance of increasing my knowledge. Last autumn, I enrolled in a preparatory course at Shanghai Baptist College. Thanks to Mr. Zhu's patient guidance, my spirits were high and I became interested in English class. Although I was studying elementary English, it felt like I was about to achieve my goal. This spring, due to pressing circumstances, I was eager to achieve my goal, so without thinking, I blindly skipped a grade. Since then, I tried to be quick but failed, and made no progress. I myself don't know what I've gained in the past six months! During the summer, I dropped out of school due to financial difficulties. Although I am still studying on my own, it feels like darkness is blocking my vision.

Last month, seeing the establishment of the Scholarship Committee's Industry and Commerce Group in your newspaper, it stirred up my will to continue to improve and to seek help. It made me understand the greatness of the spirit of mutual aid among humans, and my future gradually became brighter.

On the afternoon of August 29th, with feelings of shame and gratitude, I went to your newspaper office in the drizzling rain to get an application form. I dragged my tired legs back, and the next day, carefully had the manager sign and stamp it. Again in the drizzling evening, I submitted the application form with a hopeful heart. A few days later, I received a letter informing me of an interview, which made me feel very gratified and cheerful. It was not easy, but I finally got my turn for an interview.

The editor who interviewed me, although he was so kind and generous, I felt extraordinarily solemn. At that time, after a brief interview, he told me to go back and watch the newspaper every day to see if I was approved or not. Filled with gratitude, I quickly and quietly withdrew. On the way, it felt like I had already been approved, and I felt relaxed and happy all over.

In the list in the Shen Bao on the previous (5th) day, my name was indeed among them. How happy and grateful I am for this benevolent act of providing scholarships. In the afternoon, I received the letter of recommendation for free tuition, and the application procedures were complete. I can now study in peace. Now that I am a person who has received help from the Industry and Commerce Group's scholarship, how grateful am I in my heart for the enthusiastic help from society? I will definitely strive to be invigorated, persevere in my will, and embark on the path of light.

Respectfully,

Lü Yuanfu (I should be thankful)

### Biographies of Characters in the Raccoon Dog Case

— Liu Tang

Ever since novels featured raccoon dogs swapping for pearls, and stage plays depicted raccoon dogs swapping for the prince, it has caused many Shanghai people to be "cat fanatics." The magical power of cats is truly great! Although I have never seen a cat play, I have heard about them and they are familiar to me. Spending long days bored, I am writing "Biographies of Characters in the Raccoon Dog Case" for the annals, based on historical records and supplemented by notes. Although the writing is unremarkable, the effort of research is considerable. Shanghai people only know about the raccoon dog swapping for the prince, but they do not know what it is all about. This work, "Biographies of Characters in the Raccoon Dog Case," is not meddlesome, nor is it making a big deal out of a small thing; it is merely catering to current customs. Calling it the Raccoon Dog Case is following custom. The ancient annals were works that respected the king and repelled the barbarians; today's annals are popular reading materials that respond to the times. Therefore, I have chosen what is seen and heard in common customs, collected widely and verified carefully, to create popular annals. As for the entire contents of the essays, what they are like, today's annals cannot fully reveal. Let us wait for a day when they are published, and then share them with the readers to seek contemporary criticism; it will not be too late. Enough talk, let's get back to the main topic. Readers, please be patient and listen as I tell the story separately.

Emperor Zhenzong of Song

Although Zhenzong is not the protagonist of this case, he is the guiding thread of the case. Empress Liu was his consort, and Emperor Renzong was his son. Zhenzong was the son of Emperor Taizong. Taizong disobeyed his mother and elder brother's wishes, framed his younger brother Tingmei, causing him to die in disgrace, and forced his nephew Dezhao to commit suicide. Zhao Pu also betrayed the crown prince to curry favor. Judging by human ethics, Taizong and Pu were both people who abandoned faith, despised righteousness, were unfriendly, and disloyal. There is no need to say more about extraneous matters. As for Empress Liu, she was not the legitimate consort, and her origin was humble. Zhenzong's legitimate consort was Lady Pan (Pan Mei's eighth daughter. She died before being made empress). He then made Lady Guo empress (Guo Shouwen's second daughter), who gave birth to a son, the Prince Daoxian, who died at the age of nine (in the Xianyue year of Xianping).

The Empress also died in the fourth year of Jingde. Zhenzong had five sons, all of whom died young. Renzong was the youngest and the only one to survive. Zhenzong loved Liu the most, and also feared Liu the most. Many concubines who gave birth to sons were not allowed to raise them, and were even fostered by others (such as Zhang Maoshi, later renamed Zhang Zi in the Song History to avoid the taboo of Emperor Yingzong's name). Therefore, if Renzong was not Liu's son, he would not have been established as heir. Even if he was established, he would not have been trusted. Moreover, Renzong was born seven years after the death of Prince Daoxian. Zhenzong was already forty-three years old, and it was also the third year after the death of Empress Guo. Consort Li was Empress Liu's maidservant, in charge of sleeping arrangements. If Empress Liu had a son, she would probably not let Consort Li be favored by Zhenzong. Then how could there be Renzong? Two years after Renzong (the fifth year of Dazhong Xiangfu, December), Liu was finally made empress. Therefore, Renzong could not do without Liu, and Liu also became more important because of Renzong.

Writing Bitterly

An author was burying his head in writing in his room. His friend, a businessman, came in and asked him, "What are you doing?" The author replied, "I am writing a novel." The businessman said, "You are really silly. You can buy a very presentable novel for only two dollars. Why bother writing it so bitterly?"

Each Has Its Reasons

Wife A: Your dog barks so loudly in the middle of the night that it wakes up my baby and makes him cry uncontrollably!

Wife B: It's not like that. Your baby cries so loudly at night that it frightens my dog, so it barks.

Who Says I'm Impatient?

Mrs. Wang said to Mrs. Zhang, "Your daughter's face really looks like yours." Mrs. Zhang said, "But this child is impatient, just like her father." Mr. Zhang happened to hear this and angrily slammed the table, saying, "Bullshit, who says I'm impatient?"

### Zhang Eyun Performs in Tianjin and Jin, Song Dezhu Forms a Troupe to Perform

— Bai He

Recently, I received a letter from a friend in Tianjin, who told me about the local opera scene in great detail. I am recording it here to inform this publication and also for those in Shanghai who are concerned about this art form. The famous female performer Zhang Eyun has been inactive in Shanghai in recent years and has not performed for a long time. There was also a rumor that she would marry a wealthy merchant in Shanghai, which caused a sensation in the opera world and became a topic of conversation. However, it was just an unfounded rumor and has not been confirmed. She has now been invited by the China Grand Theater to perform on stage, starting from the third day of the seventh lunar month. Zhuchen has an excellent reputation in Tianjin and is also her home base. She has not performed on stage for several years. This time, she is making a comeback, and the grand occasion can be expected. Her younger sister, Zhang Yiyun, is not performing for the time being, because there is no suitable role for her. The male actor An Shuyuan and the young male actor Ye Shenglan were her old partners in the Golden Age. The performance period is twenty-eight days, and the following troupe will be the sisters Xu Dongxia and Xu Dongming, who performed at the Carlton in Shanghai.

Song Dezhu, one of the four little famous female performers, lives in seclusion in the old capital and rarely performs. She raises pigeons and birds in her residence and enjoys herself. Since Yan Shishan has been partnering with the Golden Age for a long time, and Mao Shilai is also performing in Qingdao, the martial female performer scene is particularly desolate in the north. Recently, Dezhu was invited by someone and will form a troupe to perform at the Xiatianxian Theater in Tianjin. The male actor is Guan Dayuan, the young male actor is Jiang Shiyu, and the famous Jing actor Hou Xirui will also participate. The lineup can be said to be quite neat. The famous new play "Princess Pingyang Liang Hongyu" will be performed at that time. Looking back at the desolate opera scene in Shanghai, one cannot help but feel envious. But there is one good news to report: Cheng Yanqiu will be going to the Golden Age and will definitely come to Shanghai to perform around the Mid-Autumn Festival. Hearing the sounds of autumn in the season of chrysanthemums, those who have a penchant for Zhou Lang will surely be overjoyed.

### Han Langen Rescues Ge Xin

— Hua Guang

The drama actor Ge Xin, who is currently a supporting actor in the Tianfeng Drama Society of the Xuan Palace Theater, is twenty-six years old and from Yangzhou. His family lives on Laidu Road, and his landlord is Han Langen. Ge is not yet married. On the evening before last night, around eleven o'clock, Ge, for some unknown reason, suddenly swallowed poisonous liquid at home in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, Han Langen returned home and discovered it, and urgently summoned an ambulance to take him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the poisoning was mild and there was no danger to his life.

### Zhou Rongzhi Performs Opera

The famous amateur actor Rongzhi is the vice president of the Liangyou Friendship Association. He loves Peking Opera and specializes in martial male roles. He is a disciple of the Gai school. His stances are stable, and his singing and recitation are excellent. He can perform plays such as "Baishuitan," "Flower Butterfly," and "Zhaojialou," all of which are his proud masterpieces. He is usually reluctant to perform easily, but he never lags behind in charity performances. He is charitable and generous, and worthy of the name "amateur actor." In the last Golden Age charity performance, he performed "Baishuitan." His baton twirling was skilled and he was extraordinarily heroic, winning thunderous applause. On the 12th, at the Russian Theater on Fuxu Road, a charity performance was held to raise educational funds. He was specially requested to perform "Baishuitan," the finale of the evening show. This veteran will surely give a wonderful performance.

Chapter 16: Taking the Beloved Bird Out of the Cage Early

Seeing Tian Hongyu so anxious, Yuanyuan couldn't help but feel amused. So she smiled slightly and said, "I have an idea." Tian Hongyu was overjoyed, stood up, walked to Yuanyuan, held her soft hand, and said, "Yuanyuan, if you have a solution, why didn't you say so earlier to make this old man happy?" Yuanyuan said, "This is what I just thought of. I don't know if the Master will agree when I say it?" Tian Hongyu said, "Tell me what you think, and then we'll decide." Yuanyuan said, "As the ancients said, when the world is at peace, pay attention to the prime minister; when the world is in danger, pay attention to the generals. Now is the autumn of chaos and danger in the world. Everything depends on military men coming out to quell the chaos and resist foreign enemies, because their subordinates have soldiers and their power is naturally strong. That is why the Emperor relies on General Wu Sangui. After all, civil officials do not have the power to defend themselves. Although the Master has a high rank, a powerful seal, and a rich property, they are all just a source of greed for bandits. If you don't befriend one or two military men to increase your own importance, once disaster strikes, you can neither die nor be captured. Where will you escape to? For the Master's sake, why not take this opportunity to befriend General Wu and win his favor, so that you may have something to rely on in times of emergency." Tian Hongyu nodded and said, "What you say is very true. But this old man has no relationship with General Wu. How can I ingratiate myself with him in order to win his heart?" Yuanyuan said, "The female musicians here are quite famous. I have heard that General Shan has always liked singing and dancing. As long as the Master invites him to listen to the female musicians, he will surely come willingly." Tian Hongyu frowned again and said, "That's right, Wu Sangui is romantic and refined, and has the legacy of Grand Tutor Dang. But the female musicians in my house are not easily shown to others. Suppose he…" Tian Hongyu had not finished speaking when Yuanyuan shook off his hand, turned her back, and said, "Does the Master not agree with this? In the past, Shi Chong of the Jin Dynasty was extremely extravagant. He also had female musicians in his Golden Valley Garden. Because he was very secretive and unwilling to show them to others, he made enemies with people, and in the end, he suffered a fatal disaster. Then, when everything is burned to the ground, will the Master be able to keep the Golden Valley Garden closed? Why can't you be more open-minded?" (164)

### Brief Biographies of People in the Opera World

— Written by Zheng Guo Yi, Illustrated by Zhang Yizhang

(38) Wang Fengqing

Wang Fengqing first studied martial male roles, then switched to elder male roles. He studied under Wang Guifen. At that time, Guifen was close to death, and Fengqing was still young. He had little direct contact with him, and could not fully grasp the essence of his art. However, the art of Wang is not in danger of being completely lost now, thanks to Fengqing. Moreover, Fengqing was diligent and dedicated, adhering to one school and never changing it to cater to popular tastes. His ambition is commendable. His performances of "Chengdu" and "Zhaoguan," etc., do have something unique, and the style of Wang can still be seen in them. In his prime, Fengqing had a square face and a straight nose. His appearance was excellent and his demeanor was dignified, making him very suitable for imperial hat operas. His voice, foundation, and learning were all sufficient for this, so he was very famous. Mei Lanfang's fame was largely due to his support. That was the glorious situation at the time. However, Fengqing's physique declined greatly. Shortly after he passed middle age, his voice and breath suddenly deteriorated sharply. Although he still had one or two good tunes to listen to when he went on stage, his frowning and painful state was obvious, far from the unrestrained joy of the past. This damaged his reputation and he gradually parted ways with Mei Lanfang. Recently, he has been cramped in Shang Xiaoyun's troupe, barely filling in as a second-rate elder male role, which is also pitiful to see. Fengqing and his elder brother Yaoqing were both extremely talented people of their time. Fengqing is responsible for the continuation of the Wang school, and it is like the "Lingguang Hall of Lu" in ruined walls, while their twilight years have been marked by frustration and hardship, as if from the same mold. What did Heaven mean by first giving the Wang brothers their voices, and then taking them away later?
