### Mr. Cooley's Visit to the President and Report: Lavish Praise for China's Great Future, Results of This Trip Will Soon Be Seen in Reality, Britain Will Build the Yunnan-Burma Railway to Intensify Aid to China

Washington - Dr. Cooley, administrative advisor to President Roosevelt, stated yesterday that he is convinced of China's great future, as he had declared in Chongqing. He will maintain the same attitude, and the results of his visit to China will be shown by future developments. Dr. Cooley's remarks were in response to a question about a news item published in a Tokyo newspaper yesterday. The Japanese newspaper stated that Dr. Cooley's report to President Roosevelt would be unfavorable to China, claiming that the report described the Chongqing government as dictatorial rather than democratic. Dr. Cooley told a United Press reporter that he could not comment further, but would maintain the same attitude as he had expressed when he recently left China, at which time he said, "He is convinced of China's great future." Dr. Cooley also said that he had met with President Roosevelt once regarding his trip to Chongqing, but had not yet completed his report. He will meet with the President again soon. When asked about the content of the full report, Dr. Cooley replied that he could not disclose it publicly, but the results of this trip can be seen in future actions. Minister of Finance, Mr. Kung, also said that Dr. Cooley had met with him after returning to Washington. When asked about the prospects for sending aircraft and other materials to aid China, Mr. Kung replied that Dr. Cooley had only returned on Wednesday, so the press should wait until he had completed his report. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Washington - A high-ranking government official stated today that Dr. Cooley's recent trip to Chongqing, to investigate the economy, can be compared to Mr. Hopkins' trip to England. Mr. Hopkins is a member of the Production Administration and the National Defense Production Design Office and served as Secretary of Commerce. He went to England as President Roosevelt's special envoy for a special investigation. The high-ranking official meant that the main purpose of Cooley and Hopkins was to personally and directly report to President Roosevelt on the nature of the assistance needed by the Chinese and British governments. After completing their reports, they would participate in guiding the aid measures. The high-ranking official said that Hopkins' report has not yet been published, but Hopkins has been busy since returning from England, ensuring that the United States provides effective aid to Britain. However, the government does not currently have a definite indication of sending a large amount of aid to China immediately. The high-ranking official declined to comment on this point, but other sources still say that this aid will be limited for at least several weeks, until Britain's security is guaranteed. The general opinion here is that China is currently slightly safer than Britain, and Britain's victory is a prerequisite for China's victory. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

London - Reliable British sources announced today that Britain may retaliate against Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Europe to see his Axis allies by providing more assistance to China. It is believed that this new aid will include building 100 miles of railway from central Burma to the Yunnan-Burma border. Britain may also assist China in accelerating the construction of railways from the border to Kunming and Rangoon. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Washington - U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that Mr. Johnson, the ambassador to China who has been reassigned as minister to Australia, can leave Chongqing at any time he pleases.

Johnson's successor is the first minister to Australia and former Consul General to Shanghai, Gauss. Other news indicates that Johnson may remain in China for another two months because Germany may launch a spring offensive during this period, leading to tension in the Far East.

Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox, Chief of Naval Operations Stark, and Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics Towers testified before the House Appropriations Committee yesterday, all advocating for the rapid completion of a two-ocean navy, saying that the international situation is deteriorating at any moment. At the beginning of this year, the navies of Germany, Italy, and Japan totaled 1,835,000 tons, not including the French fleet, while the United States had only 1,250,000 tons. Therefore, it is necessary for the United States to quickly complete a two-ocean navy. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Washington - The House Appropriations Committee yesterday approved an appropriation of $3,415,000,000 for the Navy's next annual budget. Nearly half of this amount is to continue the construction of warships.

Rear Admiral Speer testified before the committee that the Navy Department has stockpiled tungsten, tin, chromium, ramie, silk, etc., worth US$4.5 million. Rear Admiral Towers, Chief of the Bureau of Naval Aeronautics, testified that there is no danger of air force and aircraft depots on the west coast of the United States being heavily bombed. It is difficult for any enemy to fly from the distant sea to drop bombs. This appropriation includes air force expenses of $434,550,000, of which $350,372,000 is for contracts signed last year. The committee said that an additional $150,000,000 will be appropriated in the future.

### U.S. Aircraft Bombers Can Easily Bomb Japan: Observation by Chongqing Ta Kung Pao

Chongqing - Ta Kung Pao warned Japan today, "The U.S. Douglas B-19 bomber carries 18 tons of bombs, 125 paratroopers, and can fly 7,500 miles continuously without refueling. It can destroy Tokyo, Japan." The Asahi Shimbun also published photos and details of the new U.S. bomber on February 9. This type of bomber can take off from Honolulu, bomb Tokyo, and then fly back easily. The majority of buildings in Tokyo are built of wood and paper, which are ideal targets for incendiary bombs. One-third of the Japanese population is concentrated in cities and their suburbs. If bombers fly to Japan and drop bombs in densely populated areas, the Japanese will be doomed. (Since U.S. bombers can take off from Hawaii and bomb Tokyo, Japan's fate has been determined. How to bomb undefended cities, Japan has set the precedent itself." (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Editorial

### The Implementation of the Second Daylight Saving Time

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently announced that it will hold the second Daylight Saving Time, which will be implemented today. Yesterday, this newspaper published a reader's written opinion, believing that there are difficulties for factory workers, which must be derived from past experiences, so it is known to be inconvenient. However, the Municipal Council has already announced its implementation, and the Shanghai Power Company echoed it. Can we make the Municipal Council respect public opinion and reconsider, or is it futile to say so? There is no way to speculate before they express their views. However, matters related to administration, whether it is a country or a city, are based on the welfare of the people. Those that are inconvenient to the people should be abolished. Therefore, the same hoarding, but only the hoarding of rice, flour, wheat, oil, and beans, has aroused the anger and injustice of social public opinion, precisely because it hinders the greatest welfare of the people and threatens their right to survival. To promote benefits, eliminate harms, improve lives, and ensure safety for the people is good governance. On the contrary, if there is no necessity, and there are restrictions on general life and actions, even if it is called an illegal shackle, it cannot be called a reasonable behavior. Reasonableness is consistent with human feelings, laws, and natural principles. The aim of Daylight Saving Time is to start work one hour earlier, finish work one hour earlier, or even to have one hour earlier of leisure and entertainment time. In fact, the working hours have not been increased or decreased, so there is no so-called saving. In the early years of summer, there were also those who started work one hour earlier, which was only a natural act to adapt to the climate and human feelings; because people tend to get up early in summer, and the midday is bitterly hot. Heat makes work easy to tire, and the efficiency of doing things is reduced; in the morning, the climate is mild and cool, and people are clear and refreshed; therefore, some people start working one or two hours earlier in the morning, and reduce one or two hours of work in the afternoon, or even stop working in the afternoon, depending on the circumstances of their business. It is not implemented by government decrees, not forced, and not universal. To work early is to rest early, and to get up early is to sleep early; now that Daylight Saving Time is being used as a slogan, getting up early, working early, and resting early should have some success, but it is not certain that people will sleep early. First, Shanghai residents are crowded and narrow, and the summer is bitterly hot, so it is impossible to sleep early; second, those with spacious rooms and lawns can certainly sleep early, but they are still lingering in the night gardens, open-air theaters, and dance floors, and speeding through their "driving" lives, not happy to sleep early. Therefore, lights can be saved and early sleep can be promoted, but if night entertainment and night business are not restricted, it is equal to no merit. Decorating the facade, but not changing the hall, what can be beneficial to work, morality, and spiritual cultivation?

Moreover, the so-called Daylight Saving Time can truly match its name, then it is commendable. However, in fact, only the office hours are required to achieve formal uniformity; family life and even social life have not achieved spiritual unity. The most difficult is the school, the school and the family are the closest. The school implements Daylight Saving Time, but the majority of families still follow the old habits. In addition, there is a lack of classrooms in today's schools, and there are many classes. Usually, class time has been advanced to six or seven in the morning. If it is advanced one hour earlier, there will be more difficulties for teachers and students in all aspects. Moreover, Shanghai has also developed a habit, that is, buying and selling transactions are mostly in the afternoon, so after three o'clock, there are crowds of people on the road, and the doors of various shops become a market. Now, one hour is advanced, and the morning is spent in vain, and the afternoon is short of one hour of business. This is a loss to the merchants. Moreover, the vernal equinox has not yet arrived, the climate is still cold, and the sky is still late. It is inconvenient to advance the time so quickly. I really do not understand why the Municipal Council does not ask about the safety of human feelings, and strives to promote it, but the social sufferings and the security of the country are regarded as slow plans. What is the reason for this?

If it is said that the early implementation of Daylight Saving Time is for the sake of saving electricity, according to the electricity consumption during the implementation last year, although no detailed statistics have been obtained, it is said that the savings are limited; moreover, the implementation last year was already in summer, and summer is originally the off-season for electricity consumption, so the saving of electricity is a matter of course, and cannot be said to be the success of Daylight Saving Time. If the Municipal Council really wants to save electricity, and hopes to cultivate good habits of getting up early and resting early, it should start from restricting the types and times of various night businesses. Various night businesses are the only improper consumption of electricity, and also the source of social evils and the stage of moral degeneration. Therefore, if night businesses are not banned, the bad habits of night life cannot be eradicated. Although today's spinal cord is strictly prohibited, those who wander in dance floors are free to enter and exit all night long. The method of saving electricity by speeding up one hour can only be used to comfort oneself, but how can it be effective in practice. It can be seen that the Municipal Council's announcement is not forcing people to do it, nor is it like in previous years, calling on residents to cooperate. Only the Municipal Council's agencies are acting alone. The inconvenience to residents is also complicated and more than one.

The Tragic Defeat of Japanese Troops Attacking Westward from Across the River from Yichang

Chongqing: The Japanese troops on the opposite bank of Yichang have recently launched fierce westward attacks. After several days of intense fighting, they were repelled by a single blow from Chinese troops. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently met with a military expert to inquire about the details of this decisive battle. He said that the purpose of the Japanese attack was to consolidate the outer defenses of Yichang, fearing the threat of the Chinese army. They implemented a so-called strategy of offense as defense, attempting to seize important Chinese strongholds first and strike a blow to the Chinese army. However, the goal was not achieved, and heavy losses were incurred. The Japanese had an illusion, which was unexpected. Therefore, they have repeatedly engaged in false propaganda to cover up their defeat, claiming it was an "automatic withdrawal." However, the large number of Japanese corpses left behind, the large amount of spoils seized by the Chinese, and the use of smoke screens to retreat all speak louder than words. It was discovered that the Japanese army, starting from the 6th of this month, launched a three-pronged attack westward from the area around Mojishan on the opposite bank of Yichang, with a strength of over twenty thousand. The central route of the Japanese army first attacked Huangnikeng Daqiao Bian. One force reached Wanghuzi Chong, and another reached Xinheba. The northern route of the Japanese army once violated Huangtupo and invaded the vicinity of Pingshanba on the morning of the 10th. The southern route of the Japanese army passed through Jianjiazhao, Tiantaiguan, and Huaifan. The Japanese army's three routes launched fierce attacks within eight days, advancing more than twenty kilometers. The Chinese army launched a full-scale counterattack on the evening of the 9th. The central route of the Chinese army defeated the Japanese army attacking Xinqiaoba on the evening of the 9th and took advantage of the victory to pursue the Japanese in separate routes. That night, one route crossed Wanghuzi Chong and launched a fierce attack on Daqiao Bian. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 11th, the Japanese completely collapsed, leaving over a thousand bodies. In order to cover the retreat of their remaining troops, the Japanese released a large amount of smoke and fled eastward. The Chinese army then recaptured Daqiao Bian. By the evening, the Chinese attacking troops had crossed Taipingqiao and were advancing towards Huangnikeng. The Japanese situation was completely shaken. The northern route of the Chinese army also launched a counterattack on the same night. The Japanese initially attempted to resist stubbornly, but the Chinese army attacked from both sides. The battle was fierce. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 11th, many Japanese were killed. The remaining Japanese, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed eastward from the vicinity of Pingshanba. By the evening, the Chinese army continued to retake Huangtupo and continued to pursue the central and southern routes of the Japanese army. The Chinese army had defeated them on the 8th. The Japanese were seeking escape routes in the Mojishan area. The Japanese army's three-route retreat was chaotic. The Chinese army continued to attack along the entire line on the evening of the 12th. The Japanese army was still attempting to resist stubbornly, but their front lines were completely destroyed and the entire army was shaken. It is expected that the Chinese army will drive all the Japanese troops to the riverbank within a few days and restore the original positions. (14th dispatch)

A dispatch from a certain place in northern Jiangxi: A certain unit of the Chinese army in the Min Mountains has recently engaged the Japanese in small-scale battles and achieved significant victories. Since the 22nd of last month, the Japanese have gathered over a thousand troops to cover the emergency repair of the central section of the Ruiwu Road. After continuous attacks by the Chinese, they have failed to repair it. On the evening of the 6th of this month, a part of the Japanese army attacked Tangshan, which belongs to Dean, and was attacked from the front and rear by a certain Chinese regiment and the People's Self-Defense Forces. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. On the 7th, the Chinese army launched a full-scale attack. On the 8th, the Japanese gathered land and air forces to counterattack the Chinese.

### It is Rumored that Matsuoka Will Request Air Force Assistance from Germany, a Visit to Europe May Include Consultations with Hitler on How to Jointly Launch a Spring Offensive

Osaka: Due to inclement weather, Matsuoka changed his itinerary this morning. Originally planning to fly to Korea, he instead boarded a train to Shimonoseki at 10:45 AM this morning. He will arrive at 9:00 PM and board a ferry to Busan at 10:30 PM. If the weather improves, he plans to fly to Shenyang from Busan or Seoul. (14th Reuters dispatch)

Manzhouli: German Ambassador to Japan Ott departed from here this afternoon for Moscow. The ambassador intends to return to Berlin via Siberia to report on the development of the Far East situation after the establishment of the Tripartite Pact. (14th Reuters dispatch)

Vichy: Diplomatic circles said yesterday that they had heard that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke will request Hitler to send 1,500 German aircraft and 1,500 pilots to Japanese bases in the Far East. These aircraft will fly through the Soviet Union. Those sources say that Japan's request has been conveyed to Berlin by German Ambassador to Tokyo, General Ott. However, the Soviet Union has not yet approved the passage of these German aircraft through its territory, or may not allow them to cross its border. Other diplomats said that they believe Matsuoka is carrying a handwritten letter from the Japanese Emperor to Hitler and Mussolini, and that the mission of Matsuoka's trip is to request German air force assistance in the Far East. It is understood that the request conveyed to Berlin by Ambassador Ott also included an appeal for German assistance in seeking assurances from the Soviet Union regarding its attitude towards Japan. It is heard that the Japanese Emperor's handwritten letter suggested a final mediation of the European war and pointed out the success of Japan's reconciliation in the Thai-Vietnamese dispute. (14th United Press dispatch)

London: British sources here believe that Matsuoka has decided to try to conclude a non-aggression pact or similar agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union. Matsuoka may also discuss with Hitler how to plan simultaneous military actions by Japan and Germany in the spring. As for the main purpose of Matsuoka's visit to Rome, it is for propaganda, because Japan and Italy do not seem to be able to help each other at present, except to exchange greetings. Diplomatic circles here believe that Matsuoka may also ask Hitler to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. This attempt failed once in 1937. (14th United Press dispatch)

Washington: The reports from Tokyo and European capital cities about Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Europe are strangely different. News from Tokyo said that Matsuoka tried his best to state that this trip had no special mission, while Rome and Berlin stated directly that Matsuoka's trip would result in a war against the United States. People in Washington are interested in watching this very different propaganda. Reports from New York say that the original text of Matsuoka's speech before leaving may not be seen by the German or Italian people, because the German and Italian authorities have long made their people see Matsuoka's trip as a sign that the troubled United States will be troubled. Matsuoka's remarks that he does not admit the importance of his European mission may be specifically for showing goodwill to the United States, but it may also be for the German and Italian governments, implying that he is not going to Europe to ask for instructions from Germany and Italy, but wants to obtain various information so that Japan can make its own decisions based on it. Unfortunately for the Axis powers, it is impossible to take Italy's crushing defeat as the prelude to the victory of the Axis powers' honor, but they deliberately propagate that after Matsuoka meets with the German and Italian dictators, the terms of the Axis alliance will cause a direct conflict between Japan and the United States. It is important to know that although Japanese naval and military personnel have published unconscious remarks in newspapers, the last thing Japan wants is to go to war with the United States before achieving its goals in the Far East. If Germany is indeed confident of defeating Britain, then Japan may be willing to risk engaging the United States in order to achieve its Pacific goals. However, Japan may not be willing to attack Malaya or the Dutch East Indies to increase the hope of German and Italian victory. (14th Reuters dispatch)

Tokyo: When the Information Bureau spokesman Ishii received reporters today, when asked about the news in American newspapers that Foreign Minister Matsuoka would be willing to visit Washington and London if invited, Ishii replied that this was only newspaper news and he did not know about it. Someone also asked if Matsuoka would go to Moscow. Ishii replied that everything was not confirmed. Matsuoka did not mention this before his departure. Someone also asked who Matsuoka planned to meet in Europe. Ishii replied that Matsuoka had already announced that he planned to meet with the leaders of Germany and Italy related to the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact. As for the period of Matsuoka's stay in Europe, it all depends on the affairs being handled, but because he has to deal with state affairs, he will return to his country as soon as possible. A certain newspaper said that he would return to Japan in six weeks, which may be a clever prediction. (14th Reuters dispatch)

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka addressed the Japanese public again tonight, reiterating that his talks with Germany and Italy had no special pre-arranged procedures, and urged the public to remain calm and treat foreigners kindly and equally, without particularly hating any country. Matsuoka's speech was recorded by sound recording before leaving Osaka yesterday and broadcast nationwide tonight. Matsuoka said that his trip was too much publicized, but he was only imitating the state ministers of Europe and America, who often visit foreign countries and their politicians. Matsuoka also said, "I want to meet Hitler and the important leaders of our allied countries. If there is time, I will have a frank discussion." (14th United Press dispatch)

### The Western Migration of Chinese Universities is a Major Event in History, Highly Praised by British Professors

London: Hughs, Professor of Chinese Religion and Philosophy at Oxford University, said in a lecture at the China Institute yesterday that when he writes a detailed history of the Sino-Japanese war in the future, the movement of Chinese universities to western China will be one of the biggest events in history. The fact that the universities braved the unbearable hardships of the war, moved inland, and continued to operate is the most amazing manifestation of the Chinese spirit in the twentieth century. Hughes praised the efforts of Chinese universities to gradually eliminate the various inconveniences caused by the war, and praised the Chinese people's traditional emphasis on learning and the current situation of striving for various knowledge. Finally, he said that higher education within China is now nurturing the human construction power on which a happy future depends. (14th Reuters dispatch)

### Mussolini Personally Supervises Battle in Albanian Territory, Still Unable to Reverse Declining Situation; Elite Five Divisions of Italian Army Suffer Crushing Defeat in Counteroffensive, Corpses Litter Sixteen-Mile Front

Athens – A Greek government spokesperson announced today that Greek forces in Albania, after defeating the offensive personally directed by Mussolini, have launched a counteroffensive, occupying several locations, and capturing 240 enemy soldiers, including two lieutenant colonels and twelve other officers. Mussolini anxiously awaited news of the Italian counteroffensive at headquarters, hoping for results today, but the five divisions of the Italian army suffered another devastating defeat, failing to gain any ground. The fighting is concentrated in a central area fifteen miles wide and 3,600 feet high. The bright moonlight last night led to frequent engagements, with Italian forces apparently attempting a successful surprise attack, but they suffered heavy casualties and retreated. The battlefield is strewn with dead and wounded soldiers. (Reuters, 14th)

Athens – Athens Radio broadcast a Greek intelligence report last night stating that Italian forces in Albania launched a major counteroffensive yesterday with the aid of heavy artillery fire, but failed to regain any ground and were eventually forced to retreat, leaving behind many dead and wounded. Mussolini’s presence in Albania has been confirmed by numerous Italian prisoners of war, leaving no doubt. However, Mussolini has failed to change the course of the war. Mussolini is scheduled to return to Italy on Saturday, originally intending to return in victory to console his worried people, but instead has suffered a devastating defeat and the curses of his own soldiers, returning in disgrace. Last night's Greek High Command bulletin stated that the enemy continued their counteroffensive throughout the day, launching repeated attacks along a wide front, using large numbers of infantry supported by artillery and aircraft, but all were repulsed, suffering extremely heavy losses. Greek aircraft heavily attacked enemy military targets, and Greek anti-aircraft guns shot down two enemy aircraft. (Reuters, 14th)

Athens – A Greek government spokesperson stated yesterday that the Italian spring offensive in Albania, personally directed by Mussolini, is nearing its end. According to Italian prisoners of war, fighting remains intense along the sixteen-mile front in the central area where Mussolini's headquarters is located. All reports indicate that the Italian offensive is heading towards a disappointing outcome. The Greek spokesperson said that in the western part of the central sector, Italian forces launched a nighttime offensive after heavy artillery bombardment, followed by a dawn assault. The assault was carried out by significant forces, but they suffered terrible losses and retreated, abandoning huge quantities of military supplies, telephones, guns, and other equipment. The battlefield is littered with Italian corpses. In the far north, Italian forces also launched a surprising frontal attack without using artillery, but were also defeated. Positions in the northern and western parts of that area, where Italian forces launched a dawn attack, have now been occupied by Greek forces. (United Press, 14th)

Belgrade – Diplomatic circles here continue to receive reports that British forces have landed at Piraeus in Greece. These reports also state that 30,000 British troops have been seen disembarking at the Greek port near Athens. (United Press International, 14th)

London – Ankara Radio reported yesterday that former Italian Chief of Staff, General Badoglio, has returned to Albania to plan military operations. It also stated that King Victor Emmanuel III insisted on Badoglio's reappointment, but this claim has not been confirmed. (United Press International, 14th)

Athens – Rumors are circulating here that the Italian offensive in Albania is gradually weakening due to heavy losses. It is estimated that in the past four days, the Italian army has suffered 30,000 casualties, including dead, wounded, and captured. Since Sunday, when Italian Prime Minister Mussolini launched the offensive in the Tepelene area, three divisions of the Blackshirts have been completely wiped out. It is reported that Greek forces have also gained new positions in the mountains surrounding Tepelene, and the fall of Tepelene is considered imminent. (International News Service, 14th)

### The Struma Hotel Bombing Case – Report by Knatchbull-Hugessen

London – The bomb that exploded in the Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul was planted in the luggage of a member of the British Embassy staff in Bucharest before they left the Romanian capital. This has been confirmed in a report by former British Ambassador to Turkey, Knatchbull-Hugessen, to the British Foreign Office. The report states that two suitcases were placed on the train, containing dirty clothes, old newspapers, and dry batteries. Upon arrival at the Pera Palace Hotel, one exploded. A member of the British Air Attaché’s staff, Mr. Armbruster, quickly threw the second suitcase into a hole in the ground to prevent further disaster. It was subsequently discovered that the suitcase contained a highly explosive bomb. This clearly shows that the powerful bomb was planted in the luggage of the British Embassy staff before they left Bucharest, with the intention of the bomb exploding on the train, destroying the train and causing many deaths.

### Rumors of German Note to Yugoslavia – Five Demands Made – Diplomatic Negotiations Underway – One Million Yugoslav Soldiers on Standby

London – According to unconfirmed reports received here last night, Germany has sent a note to the Yugoslav government, making the following five demands: (1) Demobilization of the Yugoslav army; (2) Complete German control of Yugoslavia's economy and transportation system; (3) Granting Germany the right to transport war materials through Yugoslavia, with troops passing through Romania and Bulgaria; (4) Granting Germany the right to transport troops through Yugoslavia in the future if necessary; (5) Yugoslavia signing the Tripartite Pact. It is rumored that Yugoslavia currently has over one million soldiers on standby. (Reuters, 14th)

London – Ankara Radio broadcasted last night that Yugoslavia is resisting Nazi pressure and has decided to maintain neutrality. German pressure has aroused anti-Axis sentiment among the Yugoslav people. Although it was announced on Wednesday that Germany and Yugoslavia had reached an understanding, Germany subsequently changed its demands, seemingly making Yugoslavia unwilling to sign an agreement. (Reuters, 14th)

Belgrade – According to well-informed sources, although Germany is strongly urging Yugoslavia to sign the Tripartite Pact, Yugoslavia is only willing to maintain good relations with its neighbors and is unwilling to make any concessions to Germany that are incompatible with the country's realities. It is expected that Yugoslavia will be prepared to accept expressions of friendship and non-aggression and to establish a treaty that formalizes the existing economic relations between Yugoslavia and Germany. The Yugoslav capital was superficially calm yesterday, as German-Yugoslav talks are still proceeding through normal diplomatic channels. (Reuters, 14th)

Belgrade – Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul summoned Prime Minister Cvetković again yesterday. Cvetković consulted with Deputy Prime Minister Maček before and after his audience with the Regent regarding the ongoing negotiations between Germany and Yugoslavia.

### Turkey Closely Watching Developments – National Morale Calm – Prepared to Deal with Contingencies

Istanbul – According to Turkish press and radio reports yesterday, the Turkish Prime Minister's scheduled speech to Parliament will be postponed indefinitely due to the instability of the Balkan situation. This news was broadcast by Esme, political editor of the semi-official "Ulus" newspaper. Esme said that the situation in Yugoslavia is indeed unstable, and Turkey is closely monitoring Yugoslavia. "If Yugoslavia resists German aggression from Bulgaria, Turkey will fulfill its obligations and assist Greece and Yugoslavia in the war. If Yugoslavia joins the Axis, then Turkey will consider canceling its obligations to Yugoslavia." Esme also stated that Turkey will resist any aggression that infringes on Turkish territory and independence. However, he also stated that such aggression is unlikely because Germany cannot hope to control the Mediterranean, and attacking Turkey would not make the overall war more effective. (United Press, 14th)

Ankara – Despite the presence of German troops on the border, Turkey remains calm and orderly. Every man, woman, and child knows how to act in an emergency. Air defenses have been completed, and evacuation preparations have been made for threatened areas, ready to be implemented at a moment's notice. (Reuters, 14th)

### British Admiralty Announces Mine Laying in Red Sea – British Forces in East Africa Advancing on Abyssinian Capital – Rhodes Suffers Heavy Air Raids

London – The Admiralty announced the laying of new minefields in the Red Sea, stating that it is dangerous to navigate in the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait. Ships passing through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden should navigate through the main straits, and those who disregard this warning do so at their own risk. The Bab-el-Mandeb Strait is a narrow waterway at the southern end of the Red Sea connecting to the Gulf of Aden. (Reuters, 14th)

Nairobi – A bulletin here yesterday stated that British forces in Abyssinia are continuing to advance from the south towards Addis Ababa. It has been confirmed that patriotic Abyssinian forces have occupied Yavello (seventy miles north of Mega) and are joining forces with British Empire troops advancing from Dolo to pursue the defeated Italian forces. British forces inside Italian Somaliland unexpectedly raided an enemy outpost in Dagahbur, capturing the enemy soldiers and vehicles as they attempted to escape by truck. (Reuters, 14th)

London – Reports circulating that there are currently three German divisions stationed in Libya are considered an exaggeration and part of the Axis' psychological warfare. (Reuters, 14th)

Attacks also took place on airfields in Gattoria and Catania on the island, and Scarpanto was also bombed, causing fires. Although British aircraft encountered anti-aircraft fire, all returned safely. (Reuters, 14th)

### Britain and US Discuss Relaxing Continental Blockade – Relieving French Food Panic – Darlan's Warning Generates Reaction

Washington – Authoritative sources stated yesterday that key figures in the US State Department and British officials have discussed relaxing the blockade of the European continent to allow food to be transported to unoccupied France. These individuals believe that the decision on this matter is one of the most important aspects of Anglo-American cooperation, and stated that judging from the recent threats by French Deputy Prime Minister Darlan, if Britain continues to refuse to open the blockade, it will lead to closer cooperation between Vichy and Berlin. It was also stated that the British government may accept the large quantities of food shipped by the United States. (United Press, 14th)

Vichy – Well-informed sources here recently stated that France's food problem is becoming increasingly serious. The government is currently considering a plan to escort merchant ships carrying food back to France from overseas with warships, a plan that is fully justified. France has long relied on overseas territories and foreign countries for food supplies. In 1938, even with a bumper harvest throughout France, the food supply was still not self-sufficient. France's food supply depends entirely on foreign supplies, as can be seen from this. After the outbreak of the current European war, most of the agricultural areas became war zones, and hundreds of thousands of farmers were captured, bringing agricultural production to a standstill. Last autumn's harvest was more than half that of 1938. For this reason, the food problem has become the most important problem facing France today. Since the free zone of France is not a wheat-producing area, its need for food supplies from the United States and Argentina is extremely urgent. (Havas, 13th)

Washington – Regarding the issue of British ships intercepting French food ships, well-informed sources here recently stated that the US government has made some progress in exchanging views with the UK. On the one hand, the US sympathizes with France's unfortunate situation, and on the other hand, it believes that certain reasons held by the UK are not fully justified. Therefore, it advocates that the UK should be accommodating so that the free zone of France can still obtain food supplies from overseas. (Havas, 13th)

### Daylight Saving Time – More Harm Than Good

Helsinki – Finland will not adopt daylight saving time this year. A government announcement stated that although various agencies have made appeals and presented arguments in favor of daylight saving time, the government believes that it does more harm than good. (Reuters, 14th)

### American-Made "Flying Fortresses" Appear Over Berlin – Drop Giant Bombs, Flames Shoot Straight to the Sky – German Aircraft Attack Britain, Eleven Shot Down

London – The British Air Ministry announced last night that on Wednesday night, the British Air Force used new long-range bombers to conduct lightning strikes on Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, and other occupied areas, dropping countless unprecedentedly large bombs on Berlin. It is said that the four-engine American aircraft that recently flew across the Atlantic also participated in the bombing several times. These aircraft are the famous "Flying Fortresses". The communiqué stated that a blaze engulfing the sky over Berlin was clearly visible for a hundred miles, proving that this attack was the most intense and extensive since the British Air Force began bombing Europe. The communiqué stated that Berlin "received much" as incendiary bombs and the largest caliber explosive bombs rained down. It is said that some British aircraft flew at extremely low altitudes, strafing their targets with machine guns. It is reported that British aircraft paid particular attention to railway yards. Huge explosions were followed by large fires that burned throughout the night. It is reported that the main target in Bremen was an important munitions factory producing military supplies. The British Air Force attacked the factory for several hours. (Reuters, 14th)

Berlin – According to authoritative sources yesterday, British aircraft bombed Bremen on Wednesday night, causing several fires in residential areas, but they were quickly extinguished.

London – The British Air Force again raided North German seaports last night. Hamburg suffered an unprecedentedly heavy bombing.

British aircraft also bombed an oil refinery in Rotterdam, Netherlands, causing a large fire. Coastal Command aircraft carried out multiple raids yesterday, day and night. A total of six British aircraft did not return. (Reuters, 14th)

London – According to an announcement this afternoon, eleven German aircraft were shot down last night during raids over Britain. Eight were shot down by fighters, one was destroyed by anti-aircraft fire, and the details of the remaining two are unknown. Although only half of March has passed, the highest monthly record for German night bomber aircraft shot down has already been broken. The total number since March 1 has reached thirty-three. The previous highest monthly record was in September of last year, with a total of twenty-nine German night raid aircraft shot down in one month. The main target of last night's German air raid was Cressing, where several factory buildings and houses were destroyed, but casualties were not great. Several locations in Moers were also bombed last night, with the most damage to houses in residential areas and minimal casualties. (Reuters, 14th)

Berlin – This afternoon, the German military bulletin stated that last night, German fighter groups attacked the British shipbuilding center of Glasgow.

There was a sea of fire, and the flames surged like a tide. Warehouses in the ports of Liverpool and Hull were also repeatedly bombed. (Reuters, 14th)

London – Today's newspapers criticized the British Air Force's heavy bombing of various German locations on Wednesday and the losses suffered by German bombers in the British air raid on that day, saying that the comparison shows that British aircraft have gradually gained air superiority.

### Championship Decider in First Division Football: East China vs. Western Police Showdown At 2:30 PM at the Lyceum Key to Victory Lifts East China's Hopes

The First Division football championship will be decided today. East China will face Western Police at 2:30 PM this afternoon at the Lyceum on Albert Road. Ticket prices remain the same. East China's lineup is the same as the one that defeated Portugal last week. Li Yichen remains at full-back, forming two iron gates with Zhuang Youren. The central defenders, Han Liang, and the five forwards are also the same as last week. Although Western Police has lost to East China twice in the first round of the league and the Scott Cup, both victories were due to luck. In terms of strength, East China is not inferior to Western Police. Looking at Western Police's lineup, apart from the three or four veterans Viktor, Teife, Willie Walter, and Zhuolunzi, there are no outstanding players. Therefore, if East China can continue its momentum from defeating Portugal, it will surely be able to defeat Western Police in one go and seize this year's First Division crown. The other two matches, Second Division Su Geer vs. Yousheng and Third Division Zhen Dan vs. Hezibao, will both be held at the Aurora University field. According to a notice from the Western Football Association, the Second Division match between Youyou and the Russian Army tomorrow morning has been forfeited by Youyou and will not be held. The schedule for today is as follows:

Western Police - East China First Division 2:30 PM Lyceum

Su Geer - Yousheng Second Division 3:20 PM Aurora University

Zhen Dan - Hezibao Third Division 2:00 PM Aurora University

### Grain Rice Market Changes Three Times a Day From Rise to Fall Back to High Opening Highest at 4,000 Yuan Per Package The Wolf's Heart of Price Gouging is Still Not Dead After the Storm, Prices are Raised Again

Yesterday's market rose and fell sharply, and the market price fluctuated by as much as seven or eight yuan. The early market rise was still the usual tactic of speculators spreading rumors and raising prices. It was rumored in the black market that the 3,000 tons of rice set by Saigon lacked shipping, and that the Japanese merchants were also transporting foreign rice, which aroused people's anxieties even more. The hoarders took the opportunity to hoard and manipulate, and the practice of price speculation became more and more intense, surging all the way and fluctuating endlessly. At that time, the price speculation for each white package in the small market reached 4,000 yuan. The second-grade Saigon also reached 3,700 or 800 yuan, and the first-grade Saigon Siam reached 3,500 or 600 yuan. In the black market, the increase was as much as 700 or 800 yuan, which was another leap of 500 or 600 yuan compared to the previous day, which was really staggering. Who would have thought that the hoarders would be ecstatic, and the undercover agents in the market secretly monitored them, detected illegal transactions, and arrested a rice merchant, Zhang Mou. Once the news spread, the hoarders also became wary and immediately restrained themselves. Most of them did not dare to enter the market again, and the retailers were frightened and came out of their nests, and the market price suddenly decreased. From this, it can be seen that if the authorities in the concession can enforce the law impartially and severely investigate, it will indeed have a very easy effect on stabilizing the rice market. If they can further investigate private hoarding and order sales, they must pay attention to the large households with both wealth and power, break through the emotional barriers, and take fair measures. Then, the realization of the stability of the rice market may not be impossible. The price of small glutinous rice per hundred packages rose from 3,500 or 600 yuan to 4,000 yuan, and then fell to 3,200 yuan, a huge amount of eight yuan. Other small amounts varied from three to five or six yuan. Subsequently, because many large households still insisted on not selling, and the short covering and new longs took advantage of the flat absorption, the market rose again by two or three yuan. As a result, the price speculation for small glutinous rice was 3,400 or 500 yuan per white package, which was still slightly higher than the previous night. Small glutinous rice was 3,600 yuan, second-grade Saigon was 3,400 or 500 yuan, first-grade Saigon Siam was 3,100 or 200 yuan, 2,800 yuan for the decision, and 2,400 or 500 yuan for broken tips. However, looking back at the previous market, this price is still increased by about three yuan per package.

After the thick and thin japonica rice and other national rice recovered from fatigue for two days, yesterday the owners saw that the goods were limited, and the foreign rice continued to boom, so they were determined not to relax. The local shops and other customers also held the same opinion, and because of the consecutive days of watching, the stock was gradually thinning and urgently needed to be replenished. Therefore, they took the opportunity of the stable period to successively enter, and the sales market turned smoothly for a while. Under the shouting of the owners, the prices of both thick and thin japonica rice all recovered by more than two yuan. It is estimated that Changbang Gao White Japonica rice is 127 yuan, Kunshan is 123 yuan and 5 yuan, Qingjiao is 121 and a half yuan for thin rice, and the second is 120 yuan and a half yuan.

The supply of glutinous rice in the market is scarce, and the sales market in all directions is still wide, so the supply continues to be insufficient. The owners are hoarding and acting coquettishly, and the market price has risen again by a huge four yuan. The opening price of Hong Kong Baiyuan is as high as 109 yuan, and the decision is 106 yuan. This is because it is not subject to the limit price and is also driven by the rice injection.

The source of foreign rice is surging fiercely. Yesterday, Taikoo Chongqing and Hong Kong transported 5,413 packages, and the company's Hanyang also loaded 3,010 packages from Hong Kong, all of which were unloaded at the French Concession's own pier. The Java Company's Zhini Canada transported a large amount of 2,400 tons of foreign rice via Hong Kong, totaling 24,500 packages. Yesterday, a total of more than 22,000 packages arrived. (Grandson)

### Flour Market Prosperous Another Rise of About One Yuan

Flour In yesterday's foreign flour market, the situation was quite good. Although there were no official transactions in the market, speculation and retail hoarding secretly bought a lot. This was due to the influence of the soaring rice prices, which made people panic and unable to live in peace. 50,000 packages of the newly arrived sailboat brand Canadian flour have already been unloaded. The owners are all guarding and not selling, so it is not easy for buyers to get a lot. It is heard that the price of Australian flour with the clock tower and bird pattern is 33 yuan and 45 cents, and the price of Jinlong and sailboat brand Canadian flour is also 32 yuan. The market is thriving, and it is about one yuan higher than the previous day.

Foreign Flour A large amount of foreign flour has arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang, in addition to transporting foreign rice from Hong Kong, also has a large amount of flour, totaling 47,498 packages, which are produced in Australia and are being unloaded yesterday.

Wheat Yesterday's wheat transaction was still sluggish. The market wanted to purchase goods. Fufeng Factory has stopped production due to lack of wheat. Fuxin Factory is reluctantly supplying it with newly arrived foreign wheat. Du Wheat has also been ignored. Although the Japanese factory's appetite is strong, it is also without goods to import. The market is still as silent as before.

### Oil Beans and Grains Easy to Rise but Difficult to Fall

Yesterday's turbulent market for miscellaneous grains and oil beans was truly shocking. Due to the previous unsettled bean cake transactions and frequent disputes, spot transactions for bean cakes were automatically suspended. However, the situation is still favorable. Peanut oil fell by two yuan. There were no spot goods for soybean oil. In the futures market, the oil regulation company organized in the morning released it, and the opening price was lowered by one and a half yuan (137 yuan and a half). Afterwards, the hoarders absorbed at a low price, so the competition in the middle was quite fierce, and the market price fluctuated. Because the company has ample funds, under the pressure, its lowest price fell by six or six or six yuan compared to the previous day's market (133 yuan). However, the hoarders outside the industry made every effort to search, and the result was that it was forced up to the opening price. There was also inquiry about the export route for soybeans, and the hoarders gained momentum, and the market price soared by about two yuan. Spot corn was firm and stable. Some people took profits and came out in the futures market, so the market was flattened, and it also fell by one yuan in the middle.

### Finance Foreign Exchange Inflow Booming Again

Yesterday's foreign exchange market HSBC's listing did not rise or fall. In the dark market of British and American exchanges, the demand was high due to the endless stream of speculators. However, foreign banks and American banks did not supply enough, and although the potential was good, it was still stable. It was heard at noon that there were many transactions. Hong Kong Electric, import firms, and Chinese merchants and speculators all came to buy near-term and forward US exchanges, resulting in an opening price of 5.46875 yuan. By noon, it was difficult to close the April contract. The shilling Hong Kong Electric once offered some to the British bank, and it was also softened to 3 shillings 34375. Later, due to the absorption by British and American Tobacco, it returned to softness, and the monthly contract shrunk. The closing price in the evening was 3 shillings 34375 for spot British gold and 5.46875 yuan for US exchange, which was 0.015625 higher than the previous day. The US was neither good nor bad. The futures US exchange contracted.

Hong Kong Purchases Chinese Merchants Follow Up

In the early morning, because the recent fixing of the big London bill was smooth and the forward contract rose by 0.0615, the silver price in New York was still flat, the raw gold in London was stable, and the exchange rate between British and American Shanghai was unchanged. The exchange rate between the US and the UK did not change, and it fell by one point against Shanghai. There was no market against France. The central listing and all exchanges remained the same. The bank opened the spot selling price in the morning at 3 shillings 359375 for British gold and 5 yuan 57875 for US exchange, both of which were the same as the closing price of the previous day. After opening, it was first heard that Hong Kong Electric came to buy the exchange, and the Chinese bank was willing to sell, and the market was stable. It is estimated that the Chinese bank's Zhejiang issued the April US exchange for Hong Kong Electric at 5 yuan 46875. The American bank supplied the four-month exchange at 5.46875 yuan for import firms and Chinese merchants and speculators to follow up. The market became brisk due to the booming demand for forward contracts. The US four-month exchange and the current month exchange were seen to be pulled apart again, but the current and forward trends of the shilling were consistent and softened at the same time. The result of the noon close was that the spot exchange had reached 5 yuan 34375, and the US exchange was still 5 yuan 46875.

British and American Tobacco Have Settlements

At the beginning of the afternoon market, speculators came to sell the April US exchange, so the potential once recovered. It is estimated that a speculator sold to a certain American bank at a price of 5 yuan 46875, but soon after, the British and American Tobacco Company suddenly had a need and settled the April US exchange with a certain American bank at 5 yuan 4375, and the current exchange of 5 yuan 46875 for the current month was also difficult to close. The result of the evening close was that the spot exchange and the near-term and forward British exchanges were all 3 shillings 34375, the spot US exchange was 5 yuan 46875, and the near-term and forward exchanges were all 5 yuan 4375. Compared with the closing price yesterday, the British exchange's spot and futures contracted by 0.015625, the US exchange's spot was fixed, and the near-term and forward contracts were tightened by 0.03125 each.

Hong Kong's Shanghai Exchange Alone Sees a Slight Increase

Hong Kong, 14th (Friday) Electricity. The exchange market opened flat this morning. The British, American, and Japanese exchanges did not rise or fall (the spot US exchange closed back to 24 yuan and a half yesterday). The spot Shanghai exchange rose by one yuan and a half to 446 yuan and 5 jiao (yesterday's closing price was 445 yuan). The exchange market was flat at 11:30. There were no changes in all exchanges. It was reported flat at 2:30 in the afternoon. The spot exchange increased by another 2 jiao and 5 points, to 446 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 points. There were no other changes.

Tianjin's British and American Exchanges Contracted Simultaneously

Tianjin, 14th (Friday) Electricity. The exchange market opened soft this morning. The London telegraphic transfer contracted by 0.0625, to 3 pence 75. The New York telegraphic transfer shrunk by 0.09375, to 6 yuan 15625. The Shanghai exchange rose by 2 jiao and 5 points, to 88 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 points. The "United Note" dark plate slightly increased by 1 jiao, to 73 yuan and 4 jiao.

### Cash Plummets by a Hundred Dollars; Swap Traders Forced to Pay Out

Yesterday's gold market witnessed hectic trading in the pre-market session. It coincided with the swap date for February transitioning into April. Trading commenced from 1 PM to 2 PM, so the March contract remained firm in the morning, bolstered by tight foreign exchange conditions. It was rumored that sellers had to pay out forty dollars to buyers, leading to a flurry of short covering. Eventually, a certain gold firm supplied 700 taels, and the price rose from six thousand three hundred and fifteen dollars to six thousand three hundred and sixty-eight dollars without any significant fluctuation. In the afternoon, due to the payout required by swap sellers, the April contract debuted at a lower price of six thousand three hundred and thirty-five dollars, triggering a wave of profit-taking. The U.S. dollar also strengthened, causing the price to retreat to six thousand three hundred and five dollars. Exchange merchants stepped in, stabilizing the market, and the price settled at six thousand three hundred and twenty-three dollars, nominally down seven dollars but effectively up thirty-one dollars, reflecting the thirty-eight-dollar payout by swap sellers. Total trading volume for the day exceeded thirty thousand taels. Cash supply exceeded demand, causing a sharp decline of nearly one hundred dollars. Jewelry gold and customs gold remained unchanged.

Hectic Trading, Nominally Down, Effectively Up

From the morning, the March contract per bar (ten taels) initially showed strength, opening at six thousand three hundred and fifty dollars at 9:15 AM, twenty dollars higher than the previous evening's closing price. Cheng Kee Cheung Wo sold, and the price retreated to six thousand three hundred and thirty-five dollars. Tak Chee Hang Kee bought in, and as foreign exchange softened, the price gradually rose, gaining over thirty dollars to reach six thousand three hundred and sixty-eight dollars. Cheng Kee sold again, and Tai Fung also offered, around six thousand three hundred and sixty dollars, which Tung Hong Wing Sum Yuen bought. The market generally stabilized, closing at six thousand three hundred and fifty-nine dollars at noon, up twenty-nine dollars from the previous day's closing price, with a fluctuation of thirty-three dollars in the first half of the day. At 12:40 PM, swap trading, transitioning from March to April, began off-market. Initially, sellers offered a payout of thirty-five dollars to buyers. Hang Kee and Cheng Fei paid in, minimally twenty-seven dollars. Soon, sellers such as Tin Yuen Yat Lei Sun Fung Wing Loi offered payouts, gradually increasing to forty dollars officially at 1 PM, finalized at forty-two dollars. Cheng Kee, Sum Yuen, and Hang Kee continued to pay in, later retracting slightly to thirty-six dollars, and finally thirty-eight dollars. At 2 PM, the April contract opened at six thousand three hundred and thirty-five dollars, twenty-four dollars lower than the noon closing price (for March), inevitably triggering profit-taking. Sun Fung Wing, Tai Fung, Tung Hong, and Wing Yat sold, causing an immediate drop of thirty dollars to six thousand three hundred and five dollars. Exchange merchants suddenly stepped in, and Yan Sing Wing and Hang Kee bought, pushing the price back up to around six thousand three hundred and fifteen dollars. Sun Fung Wing bought in, and the market closed at six thousand three hundred and twenty-three dollars at 4 PM, nominally down seven dollars from the previous market price, but with the addition of the thirty-eight-dollar forward premium, effectively up thirty-one dollars. Based on the April contract's U.S. dollar exchange rate of 5.4375, the settlement price was six thousand four hundred and four dollars and sixty cents, accounting for a difference of eighty-one dollars and sixty cents. The afternoon saw a fluctuation of thirty dollars, with a total difference of sixty-three dollars for the day. After closing, the price retreated to six thousand three hundred and sixteen dollars. Cash prices saw a gradual decline, starting with Tak Foo offering 100 taels and Ho Shing offering 50 taels, both at a price of three hundred and eighty dollars above the March contract price. Cheung Wo offered 100 taels at three hundred and seventy dollars above. In the afternoon, Tak Foo offered Sun Yuen 100 taels at three hundred and seventy dollars above the April contract price. The cash market firms' listed selling prices were three hundred and eighty dollars higher than the hectic forward contract price, and the buying prices were eighty dollars lower than the selling prices. There was still no price or market for spot gold.

Jewelry Gold Remains Unchanged

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at Ta Tung Hong and Sun Tung Hong remained at six hundred and ninety dollars, with a forty-dollar reduction for purchases, it was said.

### Foreign Currencies Mixed

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw slightly rising pre-market prices, but cash prices remained weak. British and American gold pounds remained level, while British gold drafts softened. The U.S. dollar fluctuated after rising, eventually settling at the same level, reaching a high of eighteen dollars, one dime, and six cents at noon, finally settling at eighteen dollars and one dime. Hong Kong drafts showed a firm trend, reaching a high of four dollars, four dimes, and eight cents in the evening market. Japanese yen and Korean drafts showed upward trends, with the former rising to one dollar, nine dimes, and five mils, and the latter rising to one dollar, five dimes, and eight cents.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Plunging

The public debt market was weak and declining. Most activity was concentrated in Category C bonds, which declined significantly. Category B bonds were already past the lottery drawing, so there were many sellers. Category A bonds were highly valued due to their lottery rights, small volume, and short term, so everyone rushed to them, and short sellers were reluctant to sell them, limiting their decline. Yesterday, rumors persisted, and bulls retreated. Although there was still buying, it was not as enthusiastic as before. The market was flat and weak in the morning. Shun Cheong, Hang Hong, and Union Lee bought a lot, and Five Wo, Tai Wah, and Tai Tung bought at market prices, limiting the decline. In the afternoon, selling pressure increased. Xie Hong, Wo Fung, Tai Chung, Tak, and Union Ho also sold a lot. Category C bonds opened at six dollars and seven dimes, quickly breaking the six-dollar mark. Shun Cheong, Wing Hong, Union Lee, Shun Cheong, Xie Tai, Yi Chung, Cheung Hong, and Ku Foo bought, but were not enthusiastic, and the market appeared sluggish. The trend was still uncertain, and the future may see some fluctuation. It is hoped that the rumors will subside. Market prices ultimately fell by two dimes to one dollar. Trading volume was over three million dollars. A simplified table is listed below.

Stock trading involved one hundred shares of Zhabei Electric Power stock, priced at eight dollars.

Also, the stock market at the General Chamber of Commerce continued to strengthen, with active closing and short covering at the end of the week. Prominent stocks such as Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire saw significant trading volume, and prices were slightly higher than before. Investor sentiment seemed increasingly optimistic. Rubber stocks remained stable.

London, 13th (Thursday): Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies remained flat. Only the shares of The Mercantile Bank of India, London and China dropped two shillings and six pence to a price of eight pounds, seventeen shillings, and six pence. There were no other changes.

Mercantile Bank 8.27.6 down 0.2.6

### Yarn and Cotton: Single Yarn Strengthens; Double Horse Heavily Contested

The yarn market has returned to a state of flux, but actual sales are relatively active. However, it seems that 32-count single yarn is more popular, so its price is high. A major player in the industry believes that the price of 20-count yarn is relatively cheap, so they are buying and holding. However, futures and gold speculators are selling short, leading to intense competition. The price is hovering around the 1,400-dollar mark. Market speculation suggests that if the price breaks through the high of 1,424 dollars, there will be a large increase; otherwise, it will continue to fluctuate. The high price for 20-count yarn was 1,416 dollars, and the low price was 1,398 dollars. Afternoon trading started at 1,405-6 dollars, falling to 1,398 dollars mid-session, and finally closing at 1,405 dollars.

Double Horse opened flat. The initial price was 1,400 dollars, soon rising to 1,407 dollars. Buyers remained active, pushing the price to 1,411 dollars. However, profit-takers sold, and the price fell to 1,40x dollars. As prices rose and Guang stocks were in demand, the price gradually advanced to 1,416 dollars. However, prices were slightly high, and bulls released their holdings. Short sellers became active again, and the market weakened, closing at 1,398 dollars. The total trading volume for the half-day was 5,460 bales. The breakdown of purchases by different groups is as follows:

Hong Kong 345  Mainland 100

Domestic 5,000  Fujian 15

Total 5,460

### Cotton Mills' Demand is Increasing

The current cotton situation is good, as Chinese mills are actively purchasing, but the volume of incoming shipments is not yet strong. However, the prices of 32-count and 4x-count raw materials are particularly high.

New York's cotton market is lively, strong, and developing evenly. Subsequent purchases from New Orleans and a good spot market continued to push prices higher, resulting in an increase of three to four pound notes compared to the previous day's closing price.

The Indian cotton market is very quiet. Yesterday's forecast was a slight increase of half a rupee.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading is still dominated by long-staple wool samples. The market is more active than before. In recent days, buying interest from all parties has increased, with both domestic and cotton mills participating in the purchase. Under such enthusiastic circumstances, the transaction volume exceeded two thousand bales. It is expected that due to favorable conditions and the fact that most spot holders are unwilling to sell, there will be even more activity in the coming days.

### Piece Goods: Stockpiling Activity; Cloth Prices Continue to Rise

The factory cloth market was firm yesterday, and cloth prices rose slightly. White coarse cloth rose by two dimes and five cents per piece, while fine cloth twill also rose by one dime and five cents. Dyed cloth and dyed twill rose by five dimes. However, bleached cloth remained flat due to stagnant sales. Trading volume for various cloths was over five hundred pieces. Stockpiling activity was intense, and buying sentiment was strong. Sales to Guangdong and Hong Kong were relatively strong, with over three hundred pieces of dyed cloth and dyed twill traded. Merchants from Eastern Zhejiang (Wenzhou and Ningbo) bought over one hundred pieces of coarse and fine cloth and dyed cloth. Fujian merchants bought one hundred and several dozens of pieces of blue cloth, dyed twill, printed cloth, and coarse and fine cloth. Foreign merchants from Siam and Singapore bought over four thousand pieces of bleached cloth, dyed cloth, and bleached twill.

### Rice Market Rampage Reaches its Peak; Decisive Action Should be Taken; Rice Merchants Arrested Yesterday for Violating Orders; Black Market Prices Once Plunged, Then Rose Sharply; The Severity of Punishment for the Arrested Rice Merchants is Watched by All Circles

The authorities of the two concessions, due to the continuous surge in rice prices and the rampant speculation of rice merchants, which not only affects the livelihoods of citizens but also disrupts public order, after repeated discussions with relevant parties under the supervision of public opinion and appeals from all sides, decided to take emergency action. They secretly ordered market detectives to conduct strict investigations and arrests. However, the speculative rice merchants, believing that the authorities had no concrete measures to restrain them for the moment, continued their own way. After the market opened yesterday, prices began to rise. Small grain futures prices rose to four thousand dollars per hundred bags. Market detectives, with swift and decisive means, began to perform their duties, arresting law-breaking elements.

Rice Merchants Arrested Yesterday for Violating Orders

It is said that among those arrested in the rice market yesterday for illegal transactions, in addition to a Mr. Zhang from Hong Tai, there was also a clerk from a certain rice shop. As of last night, they were still detained in the police station. The authorities may apply the measures to stabilize prices and crack down on speculation and manipulation during the emergency period. It is said that the authorities will start emergency measures to stabilize the rice market. After the arrests, rice merchants were quiet for a while, and futures prices fell to three thousand two hundred dollars, but in a short period of time, they rose again, finally closing at three thousand seven hundred dollars.

Hong Kong's Method is Worth Learning From

All circles in this city hope that the authorities can continue to send capable detectives to secretly investigate those who hoard goods for speculation and law-breaking traders outside the market, and prevent them from secretly manipulating prices and hoarding rice. Yesterday, the reporter learned that the Hong Kong government has decided to take the following measures to manage food: (1) All food imports and exports must be reported to the authorities; (2) Exports are only allowed if the stock exceeds 500,000 bags (Note by the reporter: 500,000 bags of rice can supply Hong Kong for a year); (3) Strictly investigate unreasonable price increases. Because the Hong Kong government can effectively and strictly implement the above measures, the rice price in that area is very stable. All circles in this city hope that the authorities of the two concessions will emulate it.

Conflicting Opinions at Rice Industry Meeting

The rice price in this city continues to soar, and all parties criticize it. Public opinion is unanimous in advocating that the authorities of the two concessions should lead a large-scale investigation of the rice merchants' stockpiled rice, and severely punish them. The Shanghai Soybean Rice Industry, Rice Shop Industry, and Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Trade Unions, feeling intense external pressure and recognizing their responsibilities, could no longer sit idly by. They held a joint meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at 15 Edward Road, attended by more than 20 people, including Fu Qian Geng, Zhang Li Zhong, Jiang Hong Bin, Yu Bin Wen, and Yan Ji Yun. Chen Zi Yi was elected as the chairman. After a long period of discussion, opinions were quite divided, blaming the concession authorities, and the motion was rejected for publication.

Restrictions on Transportation from Producing Areas are False

The price of foreign rice has been soaring, and the price of No. 2 Saigon rice is also close to 100 dollars per picul, greatly affecting the livelihoods of civilians who will soon be unable to support it. General hoarding groups disregard everything, only knowing how to make money, making money from the people's food, which inevitably has a bloody odor, using the excuse of inconvenient transportation, restrictions on exports from producing areas and Hong Kong, etc., which are all false. It has been verified that in recent times, navigation channels are smooth, transportation is convenient, and there are no export restrictions. Regarding the import of foreign rice, this newspaper's business news column has disclosed daily that from January and February of this year, 1,090,000 bags of foreign rice have arrived in Shanghai, sourced from Haiphong, Saigon, Siam, Rangoon, and Hong Kong. In this month alone, there are already more than 277,000 bags, showing a clear picture of a strong influx and sufficient inventory.

Bureau Discusses Management Methods

The English-language North China Daily News reported that Shanghai's rice prices rose again this morning (14th) by three or four dollars compared to yesterday's (13th) market price, with first-grade tribute rice selling for 113 dollars per stone and domestic rice selling for 130 dollars. However, domestic rice cannot be found on the market. According to Mr. Peissle, the Information Officer of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Municipal Council is continuing its efforts to obtain a satisfactory result. Undoubtedly, Shanghai does not want to have no rice at all. It is said that in the future, when rice is transported to Shanghai, the authorities may register it to know the cost of the rice, the date of transportation, the location of storage, and the name of the holder, so that they can be ordered to release it at any time.

### Three Bloody Cases Occurred Within Two Hours Yesterday Morning; Sheng Shouchen Died Immediately After Being Shot Twice; Chen Xien and Pan Shudong were Severely Injured

Three assassination cases occurred continuously within two hours in this city yesterday morning, from 8:05 AM to 10:30 AM. One of the protagonists in the three cases has already died from serious injuries, and the other two have also been seriously injured. The details obtained by the reporter of the social news agency are recorded in detail below.

Chen Xien Chen Xien, a native of Anhui, a senior member of the Qing Gang, 63 years old, used to be quite influential in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, and had many followers scattered throughout Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Chen was originally an antique dealer. After his disciple Su Xiewen became the "Mayor of Dadao," Chen received financial assistance from Su every month and rented a house at 235 Route Maugny in the French Concession, acting as a second landlord. The ground floor was rented to Tongmao Longan, and Chen and his wife lived in the two-story building. It has been a long time since. At 8:05 AM yesterday morning, Chen was still sleeping in his room when three assassins suddenly broke into Chen's room. Two were wearing long Chinese robes, and one was wearing short clothes. One of the assassins immediately pulled out a gun and tried to fire at Chen. At that time, Chen's son-in-law, Zhu Renrui, was in the room and rushed forward to hug the assassin. The assassin fired a shot at him, hitting him in the leg and knocking him to the ground. Another assassin quickly stepped forward, pulled out a sharp axe, and chopped Chen's head four times. Three axes hit the head, and one axe hit the back of Chen's left brain, penetrating about two inches, immediately causing blood to spurt out and fainting on the bed. Seeing that the goal had been achieved, the assassins fled downstairs one after another. Afterwards, the police received the news and sent Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene to send the injured to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is reported that Chen is now the "Executive Director of the Shanghai Charity Relief Association." It is also reported that the police have arrested a suspect in the case and are currently interrogating him.

Pan Shudong Pan Shudong, a native of Zhenjiang, who lived at 290 Datong Road, also known as Zhi Dong, 45 years old, is currently the Personnel Section Chief of the Huxi Guard Corps. At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Pan left home in his private car. When he passed the intersection of Datong Road and Avenue Haig, an assassin suddenly jumped out from the roadside and fired a shot at Pan from behind the car, hitting Pan's neck, causing him to fall on the car. Afterwards, nearby patrolmen summoned an ambulance to send him to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is reported that his injuries were serious, but there is no threat to his life.

Sheng Shouchen Sheng Shouchen, the grandson of Sheng Xingsun, a native of Changzhou, 51 years old, lived at 33, Lane 615, Yuyuan Road, and is currently the "First Section Chief of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Office." He used a private car, No. 721, for transportation. At 10:30 AM yesterday morning, Sheng left in his car. However, as soon as the car left the lane, three assassins suddenly fired two shots at him. At that time, one bullet hit Sheng's chest, and one hit his lower jaw, immediately injuring him and knocking him down in the car. By the time nearby patrolmen arrived, the assassins had already escaped. Sheng was sent to Baolong Hospital in the car, but because the injuries were in vital areas, he died within minutes of being admitted to the hospital. Sheng's body has now been sent to the mainland funeral home for preparation.

### The Rain Stopped Last Night and the Sky Cleared; The Full Eclipse of the Moon was Seen

The time of the lunar eclipse was yesterday at 7:00 PM. The whole day before was raining, but it stopped towards dusk, and soon the clouds were swept away, and the moon suddenly rose. From around 7:00 PM in the evening, the full extent of the lunar eclipse could be clearly seen. However, yesterday evening's lunar eclipse only obscured one corner, and soon it became full again. It was not a total eclipse, but it was extremely spectacular.

### Daylight Saving Time Implemented Tonight

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council launched the Daylight Saving Time movement last summer, various agencies, organizations, and major companies, businesses, and factories have all set their clocks forward by one hour to start work earlier, which has been quite effective in stimulating energy, strengthening physical fitness, and improving work efficiency. In order to continue to promote this, the Shanghai Municipal Council has jointly decided with the French Municipal Council, etc., to start this year's Daylight Saving Time movement from midnight today (Saturday). At that time, all clocks will be set forward by one hour, the same as last year. The two councils also hope that all sectors of the city and public and private organizations will comply with it, not only to save electricity supply, but also to increase work efficiency and promote good habits of early rising and early sleeping. A reporter from the New Sound Society learned from various sources yesterday that all the banks and money changers affiliated with the Silver and Money Industry Association, as well as various foreign firms, electrical companies, and telephone companies, will all start working according to the new time at midnight today or tomorrow. The Shanghai Postal Administration also announced yesterday that it will start working one hour earlier from the 16th. As for various large and small factories, companies, businesses, etc., it is reported that the implementation will be delayed. It is also learned that the nighttime curfew in the two concessions will be enforced according to Daylight Saving Time from the 16th. After the early closing of various entertainment venues, the curfew will also start one hour earlier than the current time, and the lifting time will also be handled according to Daylight Saving Time.

### Shanghai British Consulate has Telegrammed the British Government; Requesting Special Ships for Coal Transport; and Reporting on the City's Electricity Supply Situation

A senior official of the Shanghai Power Company told reporters yesterday that the company had asked the British Consul in Shanghai to report the city's electricity supply situation to the British Government Shipping Department in London, requesting that ships requisitioned for military use be sent to the Far East to solve the fuel shortage problem in Shanghai. It is said that the British Consulate has agreed to this request and has telegraphed the government, and the company's London office has also requested relief from the British government on behalf of the Shanghai headquarters. According to a reporter from the Greater China News Agency, the Shanghai Power Company needs 50,000 tons of coal per month, half of which is supplied by North China and India. Before the European War, the company could obtain 300,000 to 350,000 tons of coal from India every year, transported by British ships. Since the outbreak of the European War, many British ships have been requisitioned for military use. Twelve of the fourteen ships owned by the Lessees Company, which originally transported coal for the company, have been requisitioned by the British government. Unable to obtain coal from India, and Japan, due to its own fuel shortage, has ordered that North China coal be used for Japan, resulting in this serious problem. The company has repeatedly appealed to all parties for assistance, but ships from the United States and Canada have stated that "it is a pity that they cannot comply," as they often return empty when traveling to Far East ports and are unprofitable. The Japanese side also said that all of its ships are busy transporting timber from Sakhalin Island to Japan, and used the excuse of "unable to help." The only hope is the assistance of the British government. If eight ships can be built to transport coal, the difficulties can be solved easily, and the electricity reduction measures will not need to be implemented. According to Mr. Fessenden, Director-General and Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Municipal Council has not taken the same steps. The committee organized by the Municipal Council is limited to studying how to allocate electricity fairly and reasonably. He said that he would welcome assistance in solving the coal shortage problem from all parties.

### Temporary Power Reduction Measures Implemented from Today; The Power Company Notified Users Yesterday; Two Restrictions on Standard Electricity Consumption

The Shanghai Power Company issued a notice to all large and small users yesterday, stating, "Due to fuel shortages and difficulties in replenishment, the Shanghai Municipal Council has specially hired experts of different nationalities to conduct a detailed study on the allocation of reduced electricity supply, based on reasonable principles and considering social needs. Before this study is completed, the Municipal Council has approved the following measures, which will be implemented immediately: (1) Users whose monthly standard electricity consumption from January 1940 to January 1941 is more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours shall only be allowed to use 70 percent of their standard electricity consumption each month, calculated from the date of the company's meter reading, and charged at the prevailing electricity price (with a minimum of 1,000 kilowatt-hours). The company will notify these users of their standard electricity consumption. (2) Electricity used beyond the above limit shall be charged at three times the prevailing electricity price. (3) If users whose monthly standard electricity consumption is 1,000 kilowatt-hours or less exceed 1,000 kilowatt-hours in any month, the excess part shall be charged at three times the price of the first 1,000 kilowatt-hours. The purpose of the increased electricity charges in the above (2) and (3) is to restrict electricity consumption and save fuel. The company does not profit from this. All revenue, except for that charged at the prevailing electricity price, will be included in the "Fuel Saving Reserve," which will be used for purposes beneficial to users as agreed upon by the Municipal Council and the company in the future. During this fuel emergency, it is hoped that all large and small users will save electricity as much as possible, because unless rapid assistance arrives, the above limit will be reduced, and additional electricity charges may be increased. This is to notify you."

Daily Meetings to Conduct Investigations

The committee organized by the Municipal Council to study electricity saving, inviting experts from China, Britain, and Japan, held its first meeting at the Shanghai Power Company the day before. It is now learned that the committee convened its second meeting at the same location yesterday morning. It is said that this subcommittee meeting will be held daily, because the purpose of the committee is to investigate the electricity consumption of various industries and study universal electricity reduction measures, which is a very heavy task. It is reported that the committee has decided on several research principles, the main ones being to provide as much as possible for public utilities, public health, large industries and businesses, and businesses related to social welfare, and to limit entertainment and luxury electricity consumption as much as possible. Once a formal decision on the allocation problem is made, the temporary measures announced by the Shanghai Power Company will be announced at the same time.

Ice Making Approved; Air Conditioning to be Discussed

Since the news of the power company's electricity reduction and restriction of new users spread, various industries in the community have been rushing to the power company to apply for supply, fearing that they will not be able to obtain electricity in the future, with no less than hundreds of applications every day. The company's authorities, because the fuel source has not improved, have not approved them, but have only temporarily registered them, and will supply them when the fuel is sufficient in the future. With the weather warming up and the hot summer approaching, the ice-making industry, ice cream industry, cold storage and air-conditioning users have also been rushing to apply for power supply. According to the company, ice-making and ice cream, and cold storage industries are related to hygiene and may be approved, but air conditioning is a luxury and will be decided by the experts' meeting.

### 英商昌興公司宣布 停航太平洋班 殆因德剽襲艦活動所致 各皇后輪暫時不復來滬

The Shanghai branch of the British firm Chang Hing Shipping Company officially announced yesterday morning (the 14th) that the company's trans-Pacific voyages of various mail ships would be suspended indefinitely. It is generally believed that Chang Hing's suspension of the Pacific voyages is due to repeated reports that Germany has dispatched more commerce raiders into the Pacific, and that several submarines are also believed to have entered the Pacific to assist in the attacks. This move by Chang Hing will result in the cessation of voyages to Shanghai by the three mail ships well-known to Shanghai: the Empress of Asia, the Empress of Russia, and the Empress of Canada. It is noted that these three ships were armed after the outbreak of the European War and continued to sail between the Far East and Canada. Before the outbreak of the Egyptian war, a mail ship of the Chang Hing Shipping Company carried Australian troops to the Near East. Furthermore, the Empress of Britain of the Chang Hing Company's global service was sunk by Germany in the Atlantic last year.

Various Shipping Companies Increase Freight Rates

After the announcement of the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Japanese army immediately threatened to advance southward. Therefore, the European war will spread to the Far East, and the situation in the Pacific is gradually becoming tense. Britain and the United States are actively deploying defenses in the Pacific and South Seas. Therefore, all British merchant ships traveling the Eurasian route have been commandeered. The Empress ships of the Chang Hing Company on the Canadian route have also

should cease voyages. The British Company's London service ships only go as far as Hong Kong and have not come to Shanghai for three months. American ships on the Pacific route continue to operate as usual. The Dutch ships on the Java route nearly had their service suspended last month, but fortunately, it resumed after only one day, so there was no loss. Currently, American and Dutch shipping is exceptionally developed. According to an announcement by the Java Company, freight rates for goods shipped to Java will increase by 25% from April 1st. The African route's

Royal ships will also increase by 20% on the same day. It is also heard that the American President Lines will increase water rates for goods shipped from Shanghai to the United States by 10% from April 1st. Hong Kong and the Philippines will remain unchanged. According to the company, the freight rates for goods shipped from the United States to Shanghai have been set to increase by 10% from today (the 15th). The city will implement this on the first day of next month as a courtesy to customers.

### 殷富靑年 圖刦汽車被拘 是否意圖犯案尙待偵查

At around 12:00 AM yesterday, the Tailai Taxi Company received a phone call from the Falence gambling den on Great Western Road requesting a taxi. The company dispatched driver Zhou Awu, driving car number 12102, to respond to the call. A Shanghai man named Tang Baosen (father's name: Mai Lin, age 22, residing at Lane 609, No. 63, Baker Road) got into the car. After Tang got in, he put his hand into his pocket, as if holding a pistol, and threatened Zhou. He also took off Zhou's hat and put it on his own head, and drove the car instead of Zhou. He drove from west to east, and when he reached the Bund, he forced Zhou out of the car. Tang then drove away quickly to the west. After Zhou Awu got out of the car, he shouted "Robbery!" At that time, Police Officer Lomen of the police station happened to be passing by in Tailai's official car number 12138. Upon learning the reason, he ordered the driver to chase Tang's car. The car was finally caught at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Jing'an Temple Road. In addition to stopping Tang's car, he immediately got out of the car and arrested Tang, and brought him back to the Central Police Station. Chinese Detective Yang Dongshan and Tian Changyuan investigated and found that Tang's family was quite wealthy. It is heard that he is the young owner of a certain candle shop.

### 良友無綫電廠 控吿顧客 妨害信譽

Shi Yingchi, an expert in manufacturing domestic wireless radio receivers, obtained a license from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and opened the Liangyou Wireless Radio Manufacturing Factory Unlimited Company on Beijing Road for many years. The factory produces shortwave wireless radio receivers that can receive broadcasts from major cities in Hong Kong, Chongqing, and Europe. On July 18th of last year, a customer named Zhang Xiaotong (residing at No. 11, Chunhui Lane, Ae Erjin Road) purchased a five-tube radio receiver from the company for 180 yuan. Zhang selected it himself and was satisfied with it and took it back for use. At the beginning of August, Zhang brought the original machine back to the company, claiming that the machine did not meet the advertised performance of the company, saying that the machine could not receive Chongqing broadcasts, and requested a refund, which led to a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special Court. After repeated trials by Presiding Judge Dong Qiming, and after a designated expert listened to it, it was indeed possible to receive broadcasts from various places. Therefore, at the end of last month, Zhang Xiaotong was ruled to have lost the case. Shi Yingchi believed that Zhang Xiaotong deliberately made things difficult. After Zhang negotiated a refund, he repeatedly made propaganda to damage the reputation of the Liangyou Wireless Radio Manufacturing Factory. Therefore, Shi recently retained lawyer Wu Xiangxian to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Zhang Xiaotong of damaging his reputation and requesting that the case be brought to justice. The court accepted the complaint and summoned him to the eighth criminal court by Presiding Judge Zhan. Because the defendant Zhang Xiaotong did not arrive, the court ordered a rescheduling for March 21st to summon the defendant again for trial.

### 我拋下孩子走了

— 美君

I left, abandoning my two-year-old Yana! Why leave? Why be so cruel?

I am a woman who has received a considerable education. Of course, I understand the responsibility of raising children that a mother should fulfill; I am a person with flesh and blood, a soul, and emotions, of course I also understand "mother-daughter love"; yet I left, I resolutely left: I have no attachment to anything, I am willing to keep my eyes tearful, suppress my broken heart, move forward, and walk bravely!

Originally, people who can't understand me will scold me for being ruthless and unrighteous, and even say that I have no conscience. In the third month after my marriage, I drove away my husband. I said to him: "You have a great future, you can't forget the mission that this difficult era has given us young people for my sake!" Sure enough, he listened to me and left. On the day we parted, we cried together and encouraged each other. After the ship sailed away, what I brought back was not the bitterness of sorrow, but the flowers of light. I said to myself, "I love my husband, but I love my country even more!"

In the past year or two, I have accepted the temptation of a bad environment, and I have slowly moved towards the side of decline and darkness.

In my family, there are parents who spend the whole year playing outside and not taking care of family affairs, an old mother who is old-fashioned but very kind and amiable, and two incompetent and cowardly younger brothers. Since my father doesn't take care of family affairs and my younger brothers are unable to support the family, I, this miserable older sister, have taken on the heavy burden of life.

There are really too many good people in the world!

One of my teachers from elementary school - a passionate person who has always been crazily pursuing me - often sends a little charitable money to my family.

A young bureau chief said to me: "Meijun, as long as you play with me every day, I am willing to bear all the expenses of your family."

Several college students, neglecting their studies every day, call me to ask me to dance, and invite me to go to the movies.

I respectfully refused the kindness of these good people. Because I know: If they treat me so well, what will I use to repay them in the future?

Let me talk about the bad environment of my husband's family:

My parents-in-law's faces are always stern from morning to night; my three or four sisters-in-law are either sneering or gossiping enthusiastically, and even the servants want to bully me. - When I was enduring this extreme pain, I didn't have tears, but just laughed loudly.

The reason why I want to leave, the reason why I cruelly abandoned my child to leave, is entirely because of the pressure of this environment. I think my leaving is right, and it is not a mistake. Just as my friend Long said in the short poem he gave me: "What is there to be nostalgic for in Shanghai? Home is a knife, the environment is a pit, the knife will kill you, the pit will bury you; Youth, fate, all are controlled by them. Go! Just go! This is a piece of darkness, and there is infinite light on the other side!"

Now I'm gone, I left my two-year-old Yana! When I left, Yana was still fast asleep in her dream. I think when she wakes up, she will probably cry because she has lost her mother; but mother will come back one day!

### 職業 遭遇

— 踪浦

The sky was so cloudy that there wasn't even a crack to look up at, just a thick expanse. Light rain was falling outside. Looking at the clock lying on the table in the room, it was already 7:20. After a hurried wash, I grabbed my schoolbag and walked out of the room. Heaven was especially unkind, the rain was falling even harder! The tram stop was full of passengers. Raindrops fell on my body, but no one showed any reaction. A gust of wind swept past, and a few raindrops blew into my collar, and I couldn't help but shiver. At the same time, I thought, "It's spring! Why is it still so cold?" I had to shrug my shoulders and shrink my head further into my clothes, looking at my blue cloth gown already covered with spots of raindrops.

It was with difficulty that I heard the ringing of the bell, and roused myself to prepare to rush forward! But the tram still drove past without stopping, and impatient voices drifted out from the carriage, "Full! Full!"

What could I do? Staring blankly at the passing tram, I subconsciously patted the raindrops on my body, and had no choice but to continue waiting as before! But five minutes later, I finally squeezed into another tram in the midst of the commotion, and felt much relieved in my heart.

Time really flies, and in a moment I arrived at my destination. Getting off the tram, I glanced at the clock of the shop next to the road, and it was already 7:45. Suddenly, my stomach rumbled, and I remembered that I hadn't had breakfast yet. I hurriedly stepped into a small shop, wanting to buy something to fill my stomach, but when my right hand reached into my pocket, the foot that had just stepped in shrank back in the same way. I really couldn't believe it! The "heroes of the Jianghu" even cared for people like me. I unbuttoned my coat, and took a closer look, it was true! A two-inch long cut was made on the edge of my pocket. My heart was trembling! The overcast sky symbolized my distress. A layer of dark clouds seemed to envelope my almost unconscious brain. Everything was painted in gloomy colors, and I couldn't see even a sliver of light. I seemed to vaguely remember being bumped into by someone when I got on the tram, but what use was that? In the end, I still comforted myself, "Three dollars! Isn't this a very small amount? It's only one-tenth of my monthly salary, don't be sad!" Thinking this, I walked closer to the gate with the words "×× Elementary School" written on it, and dejectedly stepped inside. Looking through the glass window of the "Office", I saw that the wall clock was only five minutes away from the start of class. Suddenly a voice called out from behind, "Mr. Lu, good morning!" "Good morning!" I turned around and smiled at them as well.

In that instant, I gained a different feeling. The stuffiness in my heart was diluted by the voices of the children! I patted my empty stomach and strode into the office. Brightness flashed before my eyes, and a smile reappeared on the corner of my mouth.

"Ah! There is also purity in this dark city!" (Paid)

### White Tiger Spirit

— Jin Xie Shan

After reading Shan Li Jun's article, "A Woman Born in the Year of the Sheep," I couldn't help but think of my paternal cousin who was "born in the year of the Tiger."

My cousin is dead, and it's been almost four years now. I will never see her sad, haggard face again.

My cousin was "born in the year of the Tiger." If she were still alive today, she would be twenty-eight years old! But she didn't live past twenty-four before being tormented to death by the evil forces of feudalism!

"When a boy grows up, he should marry; when a girl grows up, she should be married," these two ancient sayings hastily ended everything for her. I remember that in the year she was twenty-three, due to "the orders of her parents, the words of a matchmaker," and coupled with the machinations of a fortune teller with a "small iron mouth," she was married to a stranger on a certain day in the eighth month of the lunar calendar that year.

Her tragic fate began at this time. She did not have any happy days. She once told my second younger sister, "On the third day after the wedding, the heavy work of his family began. I was busy all day, unable to breathe, but I couldn't rest even a little. My parents-in-law were always watching and pressing me sharply."

In less than three months, her father-in-law suddenly died of a sudden illness. Because it was not long after the marriage that a senior family member passed away, her mother-in-law's vicious and humiliating scolding resounded in her ears.

"Misfortunes never come singly," soon! After another two months! Her husband also followed his father and passed away one after another. What a great stimulus this was! But not only did she not receive comfort and pity, but on the contrary, she suffered even more from her mother-in-law's poisonous scolding and beatings (this time her mother-in-law even started using beating as a means).

"White Tiger Spirit, it's all you, this White Tiger, who has harmed people!"

Under the torment of a mother-in-law with old feudal ideas, my cousin was finally killed in melancholy!

### Begonia

— Qin Shou Ou

(5) The Division Between Love and Desire

Ji Zhao Xiong had always known that Zhao Si was Begonia's general manager. Hearing him say this, he felt much more at ease, and a very friendly smile reappeared on his face as he happily watched Begonia get into the car and leave.

Back at the Tianjin Hotel, Begonia had already formed a very detailed plan in his mind.

"Brother Zhao Si, I need you to go out and buy me some things!" He hurriedly took out a twenty-dollar bill and handed it to Zhao Si. Only two daily necessities are needed!

"What exactly are these things?" Zhao Si asked with a blank, fat face, baffled.

Begonia didn't answer him.

"Things for women?" Zhao Si suddenly had an inspiration and understood half of it.

"That's right, things for women." Begonia opened a drawer and glanced at several old Chinese envelopes and a stack of Chinese stationery piled inside. "Wait, also buy some foreign stationery and foreign envelopes, be sure to pick out good ones!"

"What are you doing with this?" Zhao Si understood even less.

"The stationery and envelopes are for my own use. In addition, buy two things for women and give them to Luo...Mrs. Yuan." Begonia said, unable to restrain the very excited smile that emerged on his face.

"Give them to Mrs. Yuan! Twenty dollars?" Zhao Si said, looking at the bill in his hand. He thought that if Mrs. Yuan had really taken care of their affairs, with such a big matter and her lavish status, how could she be rewarded with a mere twenty-dollar gift?

"You don't need to worry about it! Just buy a dozen handkerchiefs and a small bottle of eau de toilette, that's enough!" Begonia was almost about to tell Zhao Si that this was the method agreed upon with Luo Xiang Qi to use as a cover. (55)

### Talking about "Green Wind Pavilion"

— Mei

The Peking opera "Green Wind Pavilion" is adapted from the "Green Wind Pavilion" legend. This play also has a Kunqu opera version, but unfortunately only one scene, "Chasing the Son," remains. Wei Qing Lin of the Kunyi troupe once learned this scene, but never performed it. However, the Southern Xiansuo Society does not have this script. A few years ago, when Wang Chuan Qian and Zheng Chuan Jian were running a waterway troupe, they collected many lost opera scripts in the Jiaxing and Jiashan areas, but they did not discover "Green Wind Pavilion." When I happened to talk to Zheng Chuan Jian about it, he didn't even know that "Green Wind Pavilion" had a Kunqu opera version. According to Wei Qing Lin, the Kunqu version of "Chasing the Son" is slightly different from the Peking opera version. In the Peking opera version, Ji Bao's biological mother, Xue Zhou Shi, sees that Zhang Yuan Xiu repeatedly refuses to agree to let her take the adopted son, so she uses a trick to lure Zhang away, falsely saying that an old woman is calling outside the pavilion, causing Zhang to run out of the pavilion. Xue Zhou Shi takes the opportunity to lead her son away in a hurry. Zhang initially thought that his old wife, He Shi, had arrived, but when he saw that there was no one outside the pavilion, he returned to the pavilion and realized that Ji Bao was gone and Xue Zhou Shi was also gone. He then realized that he had fallen for Xue Zhou Shi's trick, and she had taken away the little Ji Bao who was supposed to support him in his old age, wasting thirteen years of effort. He sadly returned to find his old companion. In the Kunqu opera version, Zhang Yuan Xiu understands that Xue Zhou Shi is Ji Bao's real mother, but he can't bear for the little Ji Bao, who is supposed to carry on the family line, to be separated from her in such a short time. In the end, Zhang knows that this cannot be forced and says to Xue Feng Ming Zhao Yang with a heavy heart, "This son is yours, how can I not let you take him away? However, we two elders hope that he will support us in our old age. Today you are taking him away, and we two elders are very grateful, because he can live a life of luxury from now on, and no longer live a life of poverty in our home." Finally, he also said to Ji Bao, "Son! Although you were not born to us two elders, we two elders have raised you for thirteen years, and we have put in a lot of effort. From now on, you are not Zhang Ji Bao, but Xue Ji Bao; you are not the child of a poor family, but the young master of a wealthy family. In the future, when you achieve fame, don't forget the thirteen years of upbringing from our two elders, and come visit us two elders. If we two elders have both passed away, I hope you can spend some money on our two elders' graves, burn some paper, and call out 'Dad, Mom' twice, and our two elders will be happy even in the underworld!" Xue Zhou Shi, who was standing by, also felt a little unbearable, so she ordered Ji Bao to bow to Zhang's name as an adopted son, so that there would be a reason for him to repay the kindness and recognize his relatives in the future. Xue Zhou Shi led Ji Bao away in Zhang Yuan Xiu's grief. Compared to the two versions, the Kunqu opera version is indeed more subtle and profound than the current popular Peking opera version.

Liu Jing Ran played the role of Zhang Yuan Xiu very well after Lao Tan. Tan Xiao Pei's performance of this play is very famous in the North, but in reality, Xiao Pei's spirit and movements are all terrible. In fact, Lei Xi Fu is better than Xiao Pei. Xi Fu has a poor and sour look on his face, which is most suitable for playing Zhang Yuan Xiu. In addition to "Green Wind Pavilion," "A Pinch of Snow" and "Four Jin Shi" are more pleasing to watch than Ma Lian Liang's performances. In the South, Zhou Xin Fang is the best. He Shi is an old female role, and the Zhou Chang Shan and Zhou Chang Shun brothers are both very famous. In the late Qing Dynasty, there were too few old female actors. Moreover, most of them could sing but not act, so the clown actors Wang Chang Lin and Li Jing Shan often took on this role. Now it has become a rule. In the North, Ma Fu Lu, Sun Sheng Wu, and Ying Rui Quan; in the South, Miao Sheng Chun, Jiao Bao Kui, Liu Bin Kun, and Li Han San are the ones who often sing He Shi. Among the old male roles, Li Bao Kui in the North, and Liu Yun Fang and Wu Gui Fen, the teacher and student duo in the South, can also play He Shi, and they are very good at it.

### Blood Rain Qiong Pa

— Gu Ming Dao

Chapter Two: Brave Northerners Show Their Skills

Zhang Cangqiu heard that there were thieves, shouted loudly, jumped out of bed, took his real saber, and ran out of the room. He heard the sound of metal clashing, and Xu Jing was retreating. He swung his precious saber and roared, rushing forward and slashing at the man. The man saw another helper running out of the house, his voice loud and his body strong. In the moonlight, he saw that his face was very majestic, and the hair on his chin and beard bristled. Knowing that the newcomer was not kind, he hurriedly used his hammer to parry Zhong. He felt that the saber was heavy and fast, so he didn't dare to slack off and used his own skills to resist. Xu Jing saw Zhang Cangqiu coming to help, and wanting to see his skills, he stepped aside and watched with his sword in his arms. He saw Zhang Cangqiu's precious saber flying up and down. When he used it urgently, he only saw the saber light and not the person. He secretly admired him in his heart. However, the horse thief was also very skilled, waving his double hammers like two clusters of yellow clouds, tumbling and rolling in endless battle. After fighting for a long time, Zhang Cangqiu saw that the enemy was powerful and he could not win for a while, so he couldn't help but feel a little anxious. He changed his saber technique and used the Five Hundred Styles of Subduing the Dragon Arhat Saber. This was Zhang Cangqiu's unique skill, and very few people in the martial world could do this, and it was difficult for people to resist this Five Hundred Styles of unexpected killer saber techniques. Therefore, the saber slashed horizontally and vertically, expanding into a large arc and pressing towards the man. The man was unwilling to retreat and resisted bitterly, fighting for more than fifty rounds. There was a clang, followed by a dong, and the hammer in the man's left hand had been cut on the ground by Zhang Cangqiu's precious saber, cutting off the hammer head. The man was shocked, shook the stone hammer, jumped out of the circle, turned around and jumped out of the short fence, and fled as if flying. Zhang Cangqiu was not willing to let him go, so he jumped over the fence and chased after him. Xu Jing also opened the door with his sword and ran out. He saw the man running along the small river to the north. Zhang and Xu chased forward one after the other. The man saw someone chasing behind him, suddenly turned around and threw a cold light at Zhang Cangqiu. Zhang Cangqiu tilted his head to the side, letting the enemy's weapon pass by, and shouted loudly, "The enemy is releasing hidden weapons!" But Xu Jing was behind him, unprepared, and did not see it. By the time he heard Zhang Cangqiu's shout and wanted to dodge, the hidden weapon had already reached him, hitting his left shoulder squarely. He immediately felt pain deep in his bones and shouted loudly, falling to the ground. It was a small sleeve arrow. (12)

### The View of a Striving Life

— Zong Yu

Some people encounter setbacks in their struggles and think that this is their fate. So they follow the wind, sincerely submit, become decadent and complacent, and are content with adversity. Their hearts are numb, bowing their heads in adversity without feeling sad. These people not only lack the courage to fight, but also the ambition to fight.

Anna Sten Returned to the Motherland

### "Miss Nana"

— Li Du

After watching Queen Victoria in "Sixty Years Under the Curtain," and then watching Miss Nana in "Miss Nana," we have to praise the British star Anna Sten for her superb acting skills.

The story of Miss Nana is basically a fantasy, a farce, absurd, but very cute. Lauren Young is a wealthy man who is afraid of his wife. After losing money once, his wife only gave him ten dollars a week for spending money. His mistresses didn't know the truth and wanted to extort him, threatening him wantonly. Fortunately, his niece, Miss Nana, stepped forward to help her uncle out of trouble. However, this niece, as the advertisement says, is a "mouth saying no, no, no, but heart saying yes, yes, yes" little girl, and she herself is caught in the web of love and cannot extricate herself. In the end, of course, everyone has their own love and everyone is happy.

After watching such a story, we can only "leave the script aside." As for the performance, it is consistent with the Hollywood comedy style: the humor of the dialogue, the lightness of the tone, all give the audience a pleasant feeling; there are also "songs and dances," "eroticism," and "comedy," especially the grandeur and magnificence of the song and dance scenes, and the novelty and uniqueness of the lens angles, make this film particularly beautiful and moving.

Anna Sten's Miss Nana is played very cutely,娇憨活泼，烂漫天真. Lauren Young's lecherous uncle is also just right. Victor McLaglen doesn't have many scenes and has no place to use his talents, but Lee Carleson has a very good performance. In short, this is a bowl of "Hollywood cream soup."
