### The Chinese Nation's Perseverance: America Will Never Sacrifice China. Leedom Expresses Opinions on US-Japan Talks: Only Determined Struggle Can Remove All Shackles.

Chongqing. Chiang Kai-shek's political advisor, Mr. Leedom, taking advantage of a brief respite from official duties, flew to Kunming yesterday to investigate the local political situation. He plans to return to Chongqing in about a week and later intends to visit the Northwest. Before his departure, Mr. Leedom received reporters from the Xinhua Daily and spoke broadly on various topics. He stated that the Xinhai Revolution was a revolution by the Chinese nation to seek independence and freedom. However, after thirty years, it is still bound by unequal treaties, which can be said to have failed to achieve its goals. However, since the beginning of the war against Japan, various countries have a much different understanding of China than before. China's international status has suddenly improved. Britain and the United States have also agreed to abolish the shackles of unequal treaties with China after the end of the war and the realization of peace. This is a true gain from the determined struggle, and it can also be said that the progress China has made in the determined struggle far exceeds the progress made in the thirty years of the Republic of China. Regarding the US-Japan talks, Mr. Leedom was unwilling to say much, only emphasizing that the United States would never sacrifice China, and the Chinese nation would never allow itself to be easily sacrificed. The Chinese nation itself has the freedom to resist unyieldingly, and it is not subject to manipulation by others. (Havas dispatch of the 15th)

### Details of the Japanese Army's Withdrawal from Changsha: Chinese Flanking Attacks Take Effect and Cut Off Japanese Rear Supply Lines. Air Force Strenuously Assists in Battle, Thus Turning Defeat into Victory.

Guilin. Reporters from various newspapers who visited Changsha this time obtained valuable information that could not be obtained elsewhere. Although Changsha was lost, the Chinese military command in Hunan Province, confident in its ability to recapture the city, did not report the news of the city's fall to Chongqing. According to opinions from various Chinese circles, this is why Chongqing was unable to announce accurate news about the Changsha battle, and therefore the special features of the Chinese army's victory were not fully known. According to the reporters, when Kunlun Pass in southern Guangxi was lost, the local command also did not report it. Later, the Chinese army fought hard and recaptured the pass. Chinese circles said that this battle was the main reason for the Japanese army's withdrawal from Nanning after the Chinese army's efforts. It is a significant victory. Unfortunately, foreign sources are still unaware of this. Foreigners in Changsha all said that the Japanese army's attack on Changsha was intended to hold the city for a long time, but they lost it again, which can be called a major victory for the Chinese army. According to Soviet personnel in the Chinese army, about 20,000 Japanese soldiers died in the battle. British and American missionaries and doctors in Changsha also believed that at least eight or nine thousand Japanese soldiers died. After the Japanese army withdrew, they witnessed many Japanese soldiers' corpses in the streets of Changsha. Chinese circles all said that the battle of Changsha was enough to prove the combat abilities and morale of the Chinese army. In the early stages of the war, the Chinese army command had overestimated the strength of the Japanese army, but the Chinese army was still able to persevere and drive the Japanese army away. The Japanese army's crossing of the Xinqiang River was completely unexpected by the Chinese army. At that time, the Chinese army command believed that the Japanese army's gathering in the Yuezhou area was merely a feint. Until the Chinese army defending the Xinqiang River reported that the 3rd and 4th Divisions of the Japanese army were participating in the battle, the superiors still did not believe it. It was not until the Japanese army crossed the Luo River that it was known that the Japanese army was indeed advancing on Changsha with heavy troops. The Chinese side estimated that there were a total of 80,000 Japanese soldiers participating in the battle, and about 10,000 Chinese laborers were used to build roads. However, the Chinese army was not intimidated and continued to defend the positions north of Changsha until reinforcements arrived from the south and launched attacks from the west of the Hunan-Guangxi border, at which point they turned from defense to offense. It is reported that the defeat of the Japanese army was largely due to Chinese flanking attacks and the cutting off of Japanese rear supply lines, as well as the destruction of roads, which prevented the Japanese army from using the strength of tanks and artillery. At the same time, artillery support from Yuelu Mountain west of the Xiang River assisted the main force launching a counterattack from the west, and the air force also strenuously assisted in the battle, thus turning the situation around and turning defeat into victory. When the Japanese army entered the city, about 5,000 Japanese soldiers entered the city. Since the number was small, it was not enough to completely occupy the city, so they only occupied the northern and northeastern parts. This is why the news reporter group saw many places with no traces of war when they visited Changsha. Military observers all said that the withdrawal of the Japanese army from Changsha and the simultaneous offensive by the Chinese army in the Fifth and Sixth War Zones also played a powerful role, because the Japanese army attacking Changsha clearly had many troops transferred from these two zones. Military observers also believe that once artillery and aircraft are transported from the United States, the Chinese army will launch a general counter-offensive on all fronts, and will at least make a showing in the Yangtze River basin (Reuters dispatch of the 15th).

Changsha. Foreigners here are very suspicious today of what the Japanese are saying, that the Japanese army is from withdrawing from Changsha. According to foreigners, the Japanese commander in the city showed no intention of withdrawing a few hours before the hasty retreat. The Japanese army had installed telephones (which were still removed when they retreated) and registered foreign property. The day before the retreat, the Japanese army convened a meeting of British, American, and Norwegian personnel, requesting them to assist in organizing a refugee committee to encourage those who had fled to return to live and do business. A certain foreigner said that the street fighting was very fierce on the evenings of September 29th and 30th. On the morning of September 30th, the Japanese army was still fully present, but the next morning, not a single soldier was to be seen. The Japanese army came suddenly, and their departure was also sudden. However, the day before the retreat, the Japanese army gave flags to the hundreds of refugees in the refugee center of the Italian Catholic Church, ordering them to line up in the streets. Then, under the direction of the Japanese army, they filmed "the true image of Chinese civilians welcoming the Japanese army's entry into Changsha." It is known that after the Chinese army returned to Changsha, none of the four Norwegian overseas Chinese were forced to leave. Three German women, one of whom was ill, were also allowed to stay temporarily. Others did not evacuate. The Chinese authorities have taken over the property of the Italian Catholic Church, including a hospital, which has been allocated to the Chinese Red Cross. The disposal of German property has not yet been ascertained. (Special correspondent of the United Press in Changsha, dispatch from Spears on the 15th)

Changsha. All foreigners in Changsha said to me today that the actions of the Japanese army that entered Changsha on September 27th were extremely regrettable. According to a certain pastor, when the Japanese army first entered the city, they seemed very hungry. If there was anything edible or cigarettes, they would seize it. I saw a Chinese soldier whose throat was cut and who fell to the ground. The next day, the Japanese army began searching every residence and every shop in the city, and almost all of them were invaded by the Japanese army. Many Chinese people in the city other than those in the refugee centers were harmed. The records of Xiangya Hospital can serve as clear evidence of the Japanese army's actions. Before the Japanese army entered Changsha, the hospital's records only contained those injured by bombs. After the Japanese army entered the city, there were those stabbed by bayonets, those chopped by broadswords, those whose heads were severed but not completely, those injured by bullets, and those with other tragic injuries. The Chinese staff of the hospital had already evacuated, so the hospital only had three doctors and three nurses, about one-fifth of the normal number. Mr. Barth, a young American doctor who ran the hospital's refugee center, which housed a thousand refugees, performed an average of six major surgeries per day and 100 to 150 surgical treatments since the Japanese army entered Changsha. Assisting Mr. Barth were Mrs. Barth, a trained nurse, and two foreign doctors. I saw a Chinese civilian whose head and neck had been slashed with a knife, with the wound extending deep between the back of the neck and the spinal cord, leaving almost no space for a hair's breadth. Only the muscles on the front and both sides were still connected. The doctor believes he can recover. Foreigners in Changsha had planned to leave the city on the evening of September 27th, but the Japanese army had already entered the city that afternoon. During the four days that the Japanese army was in Changsha, foreigners had to guard the refugee centers and other foreign properties, and also had to search for food and treat the injured for more than 17,000 refugees. Someone said that there was some light fighting at night, and shells flew over the city. After one night, they set up beds in the cellar and lived in the cellar, but were unable to sleep due to nervous tension. I learned that the most difficult task was providing for the refugees. The refugees needed several tons of rice every day, but there was not enough rice in the impoverished refugee centers. Every day, pastors and volunteers formed teams, holding American flags, and went to shops in the city and suburbs to buy rice. The International Relief Committee also had rice stored in the suburbs. A certain pastor said, "Sometimes it was quite difficult, because the Japanese army was collecting rice for military use, and there were several disputes, but fortunately there were no serious results." The pastor also said that when the Japanese army entered the city, chickens, ducks, and livestock were unattended and scattered everywhere. We led them into the refugee center to provide meat. We know that their owners will also allow it. We also held flags and went to unattended vegetable gardens to pick vegetables to supply the refugees.

### Severe Cold and Snowfall in Soviet Territory: German Forces Intensify Offensive in Central Sector

Soviet Reinforcements Strive to Defend Moscow: Battle for Kalinin Unprecedentedly Fierce

Havas dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden, on the 10th. According to the latest news, the German offensive against Moscow has slowed down significantly. They are now consolidating their positions and dispatching fresh troops to the front lines to assist in the battle. On the Red Army side, large numbers of reserve troops are also being transferred to the front lines as reinforcements, most of whom are troops from Siberia. These soldiers are well-trained and disciplined. The Soviet side hopes that winter will arrive early. Fortunately, it has now begun to snow, and the weather has suddenly turned cold. The Red Army is accustomed to this and will not be affected by the weather, but it will obviously be difficult for the German army to say the same. Even in the southern Ukrainian region, the climate has turned cold, causing the German army's operations to suffer a major blow. As for Moscow, the people are calm and determined, so everything is as peaceful as usual. However, the sound of artillery from the Vyazma battle area can be faintly heard, because after the German army occupied the city of Vyazma, it advanced rapidly towards the city of Mojarsk, only fifty miles away from Moscow. In the Orel battle area, both sides are fighting to the death, and the battle is unprecedentedly fierce. The Red Army troops commanded by General Timoshenko are bravely defending Moscow, and all are fighting with all their strength, which is extremely壮烈. As for the Leningrad battle area, the Red Army is launching a large-scale counter-offensive under the cover of tanks and aircraft, in order to disperse the strength of the German army. However, due to the fierce German artillery fire, the Red Army has not yet been able to break through the German army's positions.

United Press dispatch from New York on the 15th. A comprehensive report from the German-Soviet front yesterday stated that the brutal battle determining the fate of Moscow is unfolding on a semicircular battle line 300 miles outside the Soviet capital. It is said that the Red Army is currently resisting the German army's attempt to push forward towards the front lines through the snow-covered eastern areas.

United Press dispatch from Moscow on the 15th. The German army attacking Moscow today has launched a fierce assault on Kalinin (also known as Tver). Kalinin is located 100 miles northwest of the Soviet capital and is the center of the railway between Moscow and Leningrad, making it an important transportation hub. The German army, following the Smolerisk highway, apparently wants to establish a third stronghold in Kalinin, in addition to the two strongholds in Vyazma and Orel, in order to capture the Soviet capital from these three directions. Today's Soviet military bulletin is the first to mention Kalinin. Its wording indicates that before applying pressure to the Soviet capital's defenses, the German army wants to adopt a plan to shorten the central front line. Kalinin is located on the left bank of the Volga River and along the railway between Moscow and Leningrad, and is considered the closest route to capture the Soviet capital. (Note: Vyazma is 130 miles west of Moscow, Orel is 210 miles southwest of Moscow, and the German army currently pressing towards Kalinin is already 100 miles northwest of Moscow.) The city of Kalinin was built at the end of the 12th century and has a population of 100,000, making it the largest industrial center in the upper reaches of the Volga River. The importance of the city is due to its proximity to the Baltic Sea and its location along the Volga River, which flows through Stalin, Moscow, and other places. The German army's advance on Kalinin has made the threat of encirclement to Moscow even more imminent than before, and will make the defenders of the Soviet capital consider defending the rear of the exit east of the Soviet capital as their top priority. At present, the war in Vyazma and Brjansk is very fierce, and the German army is simultaneously rushing towards Kalinin, which is enough to indicate that the German army's attack on the Soviet capital is becoming increasingly tense.

Soviet Union Launches Fierce Counter-Offensive: 10,000 Aircraft Assist in Battle

Reuters dispatch from London on the 15th. From Kalinin in the north to Orel in the south, it is reported that three army groups of fresh troops defending Moscow have joined the battle or are on their way. These troops are currently fighting fiercely against the German armored offensive and are assisted by 10,000 aircraft in battle, making their strength quite formidable. Major battles continue to take place near Mojaisk, west of Moscow. The advance troops of the German army, which were driven out yesterday, seem to have reoccupied the city.

Reuters dispatch from London on the 15th. According to news received here, the German army in the Vyazma area, despite suffering heavy losses under the strongest resistance from the Soviet Union, has made considerable progress. The German side claims that the Soviet army in the area has been completely annihilated, while the Soviet side says that it is currently launching a fierce counter-offensive. General Timoshenko is rushing troops to deal with the new German offensive from Kalinin towards Moscow. This offensive threatens communication between Moscow and Leningrad, and the Germans may attempt to encircle Moscow from the north. The battle for the Moscow railway is on a vast scale, and both sides are mobilizing fresh troops to participate in the battle.

Results of Annihilation Battle in Central Sector: 150,000 German Soldiers Killed

Havas dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden, on the 14th. According to news from the Soviet Union, the results of the annihilation battle in the Brjansk and Vyazma battle areas are that 150,000 German soldiers were killed, 450,000 were wounded, and a large number of officers and soldiers were captured. It is expected that the Red Army under the command of General Timoshenko, commander of the Central Red Army, will vow to resist to the death to defend Moscow. At present, the climate has turned cold, which is very beneficial to the defenders.

Reuters dispatch from London on the 15th. The German High Command issued a special announcement from Hitler's headquarters, stating that the Soviet army encircled in the Vyazma area has been completely annihilated, and the Soviet army encircled in the Brjansk area is also nearing collapse. In these two battles, the German army captured over 500,000 enemies, and the number is increasing daily. The total number of Soviet prisoners has thus reached over 3 million.

Havas dispatch from Berlin on the 14th. The German News Agency recently released news stating that when the Soviet army retreated from Vyazma, it set fires, and the streets were desolate, with only ruins and broken walls visible. The landmines buried by the Soviet army have been removed by German engineers.

Soviet Union Admits Southern Red Army Retreats from Mariupol

TASS dispatch from Moscow on the 15th. The Soviet Information Bureau issued a communique stating, "On October 14th, our army fought with the enemy along the entire line. The battle situation in the Vyazma, Brjansk, and Kalinin areas was fierce. After several days of fierce fighting, our army retreated from Mariupol (in the Azov Sea region of the Southern Front). On the 12th, 80 German aircraft were destroyed, 27 of which were shot down in air battles, and another 62 were destroyed on the airfield. We also lost 23 aircraft."

United Press dispatch from Moscow on the 15th. The Soviet Union's announcement of the abandonment of Mariupol has allowed the German army to advance to within 100 miles of Rostov. Rostov is the main objective of the German army's attack on the Azov Sea region, and is an important industrial and metallurgical center. It is reported that the fall of Mariupol has given the Germans a stronghold to attack the Donets Industrial Region from the flank, and has made Rostov, one of the Soviet Union's most important strongholds, feel even more threatened.

### Soviet Union Prepares for Long-Term War

The Elite Troops of the Far Eastern Red Napoleon Will Deploy Along the Volga River Valley

Havas dispatch from Vichy on the 14th. Observers here commenting on the Soviet war situation are all asking whether Stalin, if forced to retreat from Moscow, will transfer the "secret army" trained by General Blücher, the former commander of the Far Eastern Red Army, to Europe to assist in the battle. (Blücher is also known as General Galen, nicknamed the Red Napoleon of the Far East). His troops can establish a defense line in the Volga River valley, 160 miles east of Moscow, and resist the enemy before the river freezes. Although the combat effectiveness of his troops is kept secret, it is believed that they are indeed an elite force. According to unconfirmed reports, the secret army has been transferred from its garrisons along the Heilongjiang River to the foothills of the Ural Mountains, 1,200 miles east of Moscow, to set up a defensive line. Note that there are three railways connecting the Far East to the Volga River valley.

### Tokyo Newspaper Comments: The German-Soviet War Situation: Soviet Strength Should Not Be Underestimated

Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 15th. The "Japan Advertiser," known as the mouthpiece of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commented on the German army's offensive against Moscow, saying, "Although the Soviet army has suffered heavy losses, it is still very formidable. At this time, one should not make premature judgments that the German-Soviet war is nearing its end. It should be known that a strong reserve and vast land can still be a source of continued resistance. If the Soviet Union adopts a purely defensive posture, it will not be difficult for the Germans to advance, but only an offensive posture can have any real strength. The coming weeks will be able to show whether Moscow has this counter-offensive capability."

### Diplomatic Talks Still Without Clue: U.S. and Japan Inevitably Headed for War

Norris Claims War Against Japan May Not Be Harmful; Japan Also Expresses Impatience with Prolonged Negotiations

United Press, Washington, 15th - The Washington Post stated in yesterday's editorial that as a result of German victories in the Soviet Union, Japan's willingness to reconcile with the United States has waned, and war may be unavoidable. The newspaper said, "The general trend of Japanese policy now seems to be moving away from 'moderate' and towards action." The newspaper believes that Japan's decision to withdraw its expatriates in the United States and its current anti-American press opinion may be an attempt to force "the United States to yield." The newspaper said that if so, Japan is greatly mistaken. The United States is unlikely to waver in its position due to any such actions by Japan.

Havas Agency, Washington, 14th - Senator Norris, a Republican from Nebraska, stated that if Germany defeats the Soviet Union, a war between the U.S. and Japan is imminent. A war against Japan may not be harmful to our country, as Navy officials have told me that our country can destroy the Japanese fleet within fifteen days. Norris also said that if Germany wins, Japan will obstruct American shipping, which the United States cannot tolerate. It is noted that Norris voted in favor of U.S. participation in the European war when it was decided.

United Press, Tokyo, 15th - Domei News Agency today quoted well-informed Japanese sources as saying that if the United States continues its deceptive tactics, taking a hostile attitude towards Japan on the one hand and engaging in diplomatic negotiations with Japan on the other, it cannot be allowed to delay any further. Domei said that observers pointed out that forty-nine days have passed since Prime Minister Konoe sent a letter to President Roosevelt, but there is still no clue regarding negotiations on the Pacific issue. Britain is constantly strengthening its U.S.-British-Chinese-Dutch encirclement of Japan, rapidly expanding its military, and will organize a new offensive against Japan, inviting Britain and the Soviet Union to participate. Under the above circumstances, it can be said that the United States has taken the lead in order to complete the anti-Japanese encirclement. It is highly doubtful that the United States sincerely hopes to maintain peace in the Pacific. If Japan remains careless and continues its current negotiations, it will inevitably fall into the trap set by the cunning United States.

United Press, Tokyo, 15th - The pro-German association organized by pro-Germanist Nakano submitted requests regarding diplomatic issues to Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Toyoda today.

United Press, Tokyo, 15th - Kokumin Shimbun today warned that Japan must prepare to face any eventuality with "absolute determination." The newspaper said that British and American aid to Chongqing is hindering Japan from establishing a new order in East Asia, and that the Soviet Union is now being forced to retreat eastward, threatening the East. "In order to cope with this future situation, we must have absolute determination to prepare."

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th - "Chugai Commercial News," which usually reflects the opinions of Prime Minister Konoe and Baron Hiranuma, wrote an editorial today expressing regret over the possibility of a U.S.-Japan conflict. The editorial said, "We Japanese have never dreamed of a conflict between the U.S. and Japan. There is no reason for conflict between Japan and the U.S." It also said, "Frankly speaking, we are not satisfied with the situation and wish to make demands, but we believe that there are no unsolvable problems and there is no need for conflict." The newspaper finally said that if the U.S. and Japan conflict, the responsibility lies entirely with the United States, so "we have told the United States that it should consider the situation, but if the war extends to the Far East, Japan will suffer, because the United States does not care much about it."

### Suzuki Visits Konoe for Important Talks

Reuters, Tokyo, 15th - Lieutenant General Suzuki, Director of the Planning Board, visited Prime Minister Konoe at 10:15 last night due to important current affairs and talked until 12:30 this morning. The official first went to the Prime Minister's official residence at 5:30 yesterday afternoon, then met with Army Minister Tojo, and then went to the Prime Minister's private residence at 10:15 in the evening. The Prime Minister happened to be at a banquet somewhere, and he waited for an hour until the Prime Minister returned home, and then had a long conversation.

### Personnel Changes in Japanese Army and Navy

Reuters, Tokyo, 15th - The Army Ministry announced that Lieutenant General Tanaka, Commander of the Military Police, has been appointed Commander of the Tokyo District. The vacancy will be filled by Lieutenant General Nakamura, the former Director of the Military Affairs Bureau. Colonel Mabuchi, Director of the Army Intelligence Department of the General Headquarters, has been appointed Commander of a certain unit. The vacancy will be filled by Colonel Ohira, an instructor at the Army Academy. Colonel Sato, Chief of the Military Affairs Section of the Military Affairs Bureau, has been promoted to Major General and transferred to the Central Army Arsenal. He is the first Chief of the Military Affairs Section to be promoted to Major General.

Reuters, Tokyo, 15th - The Navy Ministry has appointed Rear Admiral Masao Kanazawa as Chief of Staff of the Yokosuka Naval Station. Vice Chief of Naval Staff Rear Admiral Seiichi Ito has been promoted to Vice Admiral.

### Nazi Party Members Go to Thailand; Japanese Ambassador Recalled

Reuters, London, 15th - Responsible sources here today stated that according to news from Singapore, two well-known Nazi party members seem to have been dispatched to Thailand as representatives of the German government. One is Winter, the former German Minister to Bolivia, and the other is Hube, who represents Germany in Tokyo. If the German government attempts to incite disputes between Britain and Japan in Thailand, these two are well-suited for the job. It is noted that Winter was forced to leave Bolivia in haste after his plot to overthrow the current government was discovered. Hube once served as a police advisor to the Japanese government.

Reuters, Bangkok, 15th - The first Japanese ambassador to Thailand, who presented his credentials only a few weeks ago, has now been recalled by the Japanese government to review the true state of Japanese-Thai relations. The diplomatic community here is naturally surprised by this. It is generally believed that this move must be related to the current situation in Thailand and the recent trends in Japan's views on the Soviet-German war and the development of the Far East. It is noted that there have recently been anti-British and anti-American arguments in Japanese newspapers, saying that Britain and the United States are alienating Thai-Japanese friendship. The ambassador was recalled at this time, so the diplomatic community here and the Thai government are paying close attention to it. According to observers, the current situation in Thailand is characterized by the Thai government's determination to be impartial and treat all countries equally, regardless of the consequences. Thai Acting Foreign Minister Vanichai replied to reporters' questions, saying that he did not consider the recall of the Japanese ambassador to be unusual, but hoped that the ambassador would not make unfavorable reports about Thailand.

### British Government Telegraphed Chiang to Congratulate on National Day

Reuters, London, 15th - Foreign Secretary Eden announced in the House of Commons today that the British government had sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek on Double Ten Day to express warm congratulations and wish China well for the future. The British government has not recently exchanged messages with the U.S. government in an attempt to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese war. China has had a very good response to the Atlantic Charter. The British Ambassador to China has telegraphed Chongqing about the enthusiastic welcome, and the Chinese Foreign Minister has also issued a statement expressing his gratitude.

### Mongolia and Manchukuo Sign Boundary Survey Agreement

Reuters, Changchun, 15th - According to officials, the necessary documents regarding the Manchurian-Outer Mongolian boundary survey agreement were finally signed this morning by representatives of both sides in Harbin. The boundary line is 300 kilometers long.

### Japanese Ship Tatsuta Maru Sets Sail for America

Carrying More Than 600 Passengers; Japanese Nationals Evacuated from Singapore Return Home

Reuters, Tokyo, 15th - According to Japanese sources, the "Tatsuta Maru" set sail from Yokohama at 5:00 this afternoon, heading for San Francisco via Honolulu, carrying a total of 610 passengers, of which only 5 are Americans.

The Tatsuta Maru is one of them. The remaining two ships are scheduled to set sail on the 20th of this month.

Reuters, Tokyo, 15th - 362 Japanese nationals evacuated from Singapore, including 147 men, 33 women, and 92 children, arrived in Kobe at 11:30 this morning on an evacuation ship.

### The Soviet-German War and Japan

The battle around Moscow is now reaching a fever pitch, and the ultimate fate of the Soviet capital is a matter of universal concern. However, upon careful examination of the current situation, while the Soviet-German war is indeed worrying, the degree of its danger may not be as great as that in the Far East. First, both the Soviet Union and Germany have the idea that they will perish if they do not win, and this feeling is even stronger on the Soviet side. Therefore, not only is there little possibility of compromise, but the Soviet side is also bound to use every last bit of its strength in this battle and will not easily allow the painstakingly managed system to suffer the misfortune of being fundamentally eradicated. Second, British and American aid to the Soviet Union is proceeding with great determination towards a huge goal, and in addition to war materials, the issue of sending troops to help fight has also been considered. If the Soviet Union unfortunately falls into a state where it cannot support itself, then the U.S. war against Germany will inevitably materialize immediately, just as it did in the previous decisive war after the Soviet Union and Germany cease hostilities and then enter the war. Moreover, there are many thorns in the path of the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union. This newspaper's editorial yesterday has discussed this in detail. There is ultimately no reason to be pessimistic about this situation. In the Far East, however, if the situation deteriorates, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union may fall into the possibility of fighting on two fronts, and the danger to the Soviet Union may be greater than the threat of troops approaching Moscow. American public opinion has been paying the greatest attention to this in recent days. Although Ambassador Wakasugi's return to the United States has led to continued contact between the two sides, it has apparently not alleviated the general public's anxieties.

Japan's enthusiasm for worshiping the Nazis has been far less than in the past six months. The outbreak of the Soviet-German war has allowed the Japanese authorities to feel bewildered. Although the cabinet was reorganized once and it was rumored that a multifaceted response plan had been drawn up, it does not seem to have alleviated their indecisive predicament. Recently, Japanese public opinion has not been very interested in the victory of the Nazis, and they are even harboring a faint hope that the Soviet Union can contain the Nazi offensive. This kind of mentality is actually not surprising. Of course, the Soviet Union's defeat is an opportunity for Japan to advance north, but on the other hand, if the Soviet Union really collapses, then the Nazi forces will inevitably move eastward, whether south into the Indian Ocean or east into the Pacific, which will be a major threat to Japan's "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." If the Soviet Union continues to resolutely resist after its retreat in Europe, it will use its Asian territory as its main base. In addition to the route through the Persian Gulf, the port of Vladivostok, which is adjacent to Japan, will become the Soviet Union's most important external passage, which is what the Japanese side is most unhappy about. Therefore, putting oneself in Japan's position, the most favorable situation for it is the Soviet Union's defeat without retreat, and the rapid depletion of its strength, so that it has no choice but to mobilize its Far East garrison to the west. At that time, if Japan implements a northern advance, it will be easy, and a southern advance will not have any worries. The hundreds of thousands of troops stationed in the Northeast may as well be transferred to any place that needs reinforcement. Compared to waiting for the Nazis to win an absolute victory and then sharing a piece of the pie as an ally, this is naturally better.

However, if the Soviet capital falls, then no matter how the Soviet-German war turns out afterwards, Japan will inevitably take action in eastern Siberia to fulfill its desire for expansion or "self-defense." Even if this move cannot be compared in essence to the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland two years ago, it is similar in form and has the same inevitability. In the past two months, the Japanese authorities have never been willing to give up thinking about how to relax (in fact, it is just delaying) U.S.-Japan relations. The Chugai Commercial News, which represents the views of Konoe and Hiranuma, also stated in an editorial: "We Japanese have never dreamed of a conflict between the U.S. and Japan. There is no reason for conflict between Japan and the U.S." As for how Soviet-Japanese relations will develop in the future, the Japanese government has maintained a mysterious silence for the past few months, allowing some extreme arguments to clamor incessantly. The message in this is worth pondering.

In recent U.S.-Japan relations, the United States is letting Japan choose its path after completing the necessary preparations. However, there are some loopholes in the preparations that the U.S. has made, such as the unprotected state of the North Pacific. Therefore, from another perspective, Japan is still in a proactive position, and the power to decide whether the Far East crisis will erupt is actually in the hands of the Japanese. At present, the ABCD line and the Soviet Union's strength in the Far East should not be underestimated, but they must firmly grasp the proactive position in order to fully control the development of this dangerous situation. Even if the Soviet-German war may have new and favorable turns, we must still plan for the worst-case scenario in the Far East.

War Talks in Europe

### A True Account of the Moscow Air Raid

Moscow Subway Station

This is a wireless telegraph report from Ms. Purple, a Moscow correspondent for Collier's Weekly in the United States, during the air raid. It is translated as follows:

Moscow has suddenly felt the impact of the war. After four weeks of silence, it is difficult for people living in Moscow to believe that the greatest battle in history is taking place hundreds of miles away, like a wildfire. Then the bombing began. The explosions of anti-aircraft guns, the roar of machine guns, and the sound of collapsing walls caused by incendiary bombs filled Moscow. However, the general public remained unmoved, believing that the bombing had just begun and that they would be bombed every night for many weeks to come.

For the first four nights (July 23 to 26), German planes always came between 10:00 and 10:15 every night, without fail. On the fifth night, we waited until midnight. The daytime was very peaceful. Although reconnaissance planes often flew over near dusk, the air defense authorities decided not to sound the alarm to avoid causing too much disturbance. The working hours during the day were not hindered at all, and the evening entertainment continued unabated. People strolled in the streets, and the restaurants and theaters were still crowded. They had dinner quite early and went home immediately at almost ten o'clock. They packed their bedding, ready to take it to the nearest air-raid shelter or tunnel when the alarm sounded. According to the newly promulgated regulations, women and children are allowed to spend the night in the tunnels before enemy planes arrive. These underground stations, built with marble from the Ural Mountains, have long been a source of pride for Muscovites, but now they are of great use, which was not expected at the beginning. As soon as the Russian people heard the broadcaster say that ominous word Trevoga (Russian for alarm), followed by the sound of sirens, they would not hesitate to find a place to hide. As soon as I stood on the balcony, I saw people pouring into the square from all the streets and pouring into the tunnels from the square. In less than ten minutes, the streets were deserted. This haste and urgency is due to the fact that the authorities are now very strict and must find shelter before the alarm sounds, rather than entirely due to terror.

I changed my lodging every night, changing the environment, so that I could get a clear and detailed view of the situation at that time. The first night I was in the tunnel, the second night in the apartment of a British news writer, looking out from the window, I could overlook the north and south sides, the third night in a hotel in the city center, with the windows facing west, and the fourth night in the residence of the American ambassador. The place where I am writing this manuscript is twenty miles outside the Russian capital, in the residence where the two ambassadors live together. This house is built of white-painted wood and is located in the countryside, surrounded by trees, with beautiful scenery. The garden is planted with famous flowers such as hollyhocks, zinnias, and snapdragons. I came here in the morning and suspected it was a paradise, but I heard the alarm in the middle of the night.

I was locked in a closed room to prevent the lights from shining out. Just as I was writing at my desk, I suddenly heard the sound of anti-aircraft guns, which was deafening. I rushed out of the house, to the balcony, and everyone was looking up, watching the searchlights protruding and penetrating through the clouds, searching for enemy planes, sometimes shining on the roof of the house. Suddenly I heard the rattling sound of a bomber engine, but after a while it disappeared. Undoubtedly those planes had fled back to their base.

On the first night of the air raid, I was about to undress and go to bed in the hotel when I heard the sound of the alarm. I hurriedly put on my shirt and ran straight to the underground military station in the square below. Although there had been an alarm once in the morning, it lasted a short time and there were no incidents. Now there were more people in the tunnel than in the morning, but there was no pushing and shoving. Everyone quietly walked into the entrance and down the steps. Under such circumstances, there was naturally no need to buy tickets. They wandered back and forth on the platform, chatting and killing time.

I saw photographer Jogli leaning against a stone pillar and sitting on his precious camera case, so I greeted him. Before long, everyone was ordered to go down into the tunnel. We tried to slow down our pace as much as possible, hoping to be the last to go, so that we would be closer to the entrance of the tunnel and the air would be better. However, the police enforced the order very strictly, so we had to squeeze in with a group of people and learn from them to spread the newspaper on the tracks and sit on the ground.

Our foreign language was heard, so we became suspects and were taken to a small shed for questioning. A militia captain was sitting in the shed, with a telephone next to him, which rang incessantly all night. He asked us to show our passports, checked them, and then let us go.

Although I was questioned, I was not annoyed, because this was the fourth time I had dealt with the local police. Those three times happened when I was with friends who lived near the American ambassador's residence.

### US Aid to Soviets Tripled

September Transfers Totaled $155 Million

Reuters, Washington, 15th - President Roosevelt stated yesterday while hosting news reporters that the transfer of goods under the Lend-Lease program in September tripled the monthly average of the past six months. The September transfer totaled $155,000,000, while the total for the previous six months was only $146,000,000. The authorities are prepared to immediately use the current supplemental Lend-Lease funding of $5,985,000,000, as the original $7,000,000,000 in funding has already been allocated, leaving only 5%. He yesterday sent a letter to Lend-Lease Administrator Stettinius, approving the use of the remaining funds, including goods in production or being processed. The Lend-Lease expenses for September totaled around $2,000,000,000. This aid is given to Britain, China, South American countries, and Polish and Norwegian people. Since March, the average monthly actual orders under the Lend-Lease program have been $700,000,000. Since the outbreak of the war, the $5,000,000,000 in exports to Britain have all been paid for in cash. Currently, a large portion of exports to Britain are still paid for in cash, as they were ordered before the start of the Lend-Lease program. However, the goods under the Lend-Lease program are now steadily increasing in shipments to Britain. When asked if the Soviet Union needed assistance under the Lend-Lease program, the President replied that he did not know, and would only have an opinion after meeting with the US Chief Representative to the Moscow Conference, Mr. Harriman. When asked if the Soviet Union was currently requesting financial assistance from us, the President replied that the Soviet Union was currently procuring goods in the United States as usual, paying for the goods half in cash and half in important minerals such as manganese.

Reuters, Washington, 15th - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that the situation on the Soviet front did not cause him to doubt the success of the US program to aid countries resisting the Axis powers.

### Cotton Yarn: Actual Sales or Stagnation? Speculation Still Focuses on "Double Horse" Brand; Futures Follow Factory Orders Closely

The yarn market remains volatile and uncertain, with significant fluctuations, due to the large number of trading chips in the market, preventing stability. Actual transactions are sluggish, but speculative activities have driven prices up with significant waves. The morning opening for "Double Horse" 20-count factory orders suddenly declined, claiming a loss from the previous afternoon's close, creating an illusory situation. The first trade of the morning took advantage of this, pressing the price down to 2,150 yuan, a drop of 50 yuan. This opening triggered a rush of buyers, quickly pushing the price up to 2,185 yuan. Subsequently, news of a flat opening at the exchange, followed by a decline, created a looser sentiment. Shortly after, the price dropped to 2,130 yuan, showing weakness. However, there was more to it than met the eye. Unbeknownst to many, the price slowly rose to 2,175 yuan. However, actual yarn transactions remained sluggish, and prices for miscellaneous brands also declined, with even fewer transactions. The price on the trading floor fell back to between 2,140 and 2,150 yuan. Subsequently, the afternoon close showed a sudden tightening, and Blue Phoenix brand yarn rebounded, leading "Double Horse" to a positive close at 2,179 yuan. In off-market trading, the price rose another 10 to 20 yuan. The afternoon opening was enthusiastic, claiming tight exchange rates, pushing the price of "Double Horse" to 2,205 yuan. Coupled with the exchange opening, which jumped 30 to 40 yuan, "Double Horse" factory orders were further strengthened, reaching a new record high of 2,228 yuan. Later, the momentum waned, returning to 2,180 yuan, before closing back up to 2,190 yuan. It is reported that the total volume traded for the day was 13,400 bales, all purely speculative transactions.

The "Golden Double Horse" futures market turned from weak to firm, presenting a bullish uptrend. Although there were no clear prospects from various parties, people remained determined and mostly optimistic. Therefore, the foundation of yarn futures was soft but stable. At the initial opening in the morning, factory orders opened at a lower price, but due to the slow movement of the buying side, which instead absorbed orders aggressively, the market immediately rose. Yarn futures initially followed the weakness of spot prices, with the October contract opening at 1,950.00, a slight drop of 12 yuan. The November contract opened at 1,964.00, a slight increase of 4 yuan. The December contract opened at 1,970.00, another decrease of 10 yuan. Midday saw a sudden surge in factory orders, briefly pushing up futures prices as well. However, the exchange rose and then fell, causing general speculators without a firm foundation to collapse with the wind, suddenly shifting to selling, causing the near-term contracts to fall to 1,945.00, the October contract to 1,950.00, and the far-term contracts to a slightly lower 1,958.00. Later, prices steadily increased. The afternoon saw a surge in momentum, with short sellers lacking the strength to support their positions, engaging in short covering. Coupled with the unrelenting buying pressure from the bulls, the market rose in tandem with other yarn markets. The October contract reached a high of 1,990.00, the November contract reached the 2,000 yuan mark, and the December contract reached a high of 2,020.00. Although the closing was slightly similar, the near-term contracts still rose 18 yuan, while the far-term contracts rose by 34 to 45 yuan. The details are listed below:

### Cotton Not Easy to Fall

The cotton market remained stable as usual. Upon inquiring with various parties, the general response was that prices would not easily fall. Cotton brokers still held an optimistic view of Lanchow coarse cotton, leading prices to increase by another six to seven yuan. Although transactions from factories were not numerous, trading among dealers remained robust.

Qiebin Cotton: 100 bales, No. 661.0 from Home Broker

Omra Cotton: 100 bales, No. 566.0 Again

Again: 300 bales, No. 539.0 Again

Again: 400 bales, No. 540.0 Again

Again: 100 bales, No. 541.0 Again

Again: 100 bales, No. 530.0 Again

Again: 200 bales, No. 529.0 Again

American Penjia Poe Cotton: 300 bales, No. 696.0 Internal and External Factories

The New York cotton market initially fell due to fund selling, but later rebounded due to buying in New Orleans and short covering. As a result, closing prices were up seven to eight points from the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to the negative impact of the war, followed by mass selling. However, it subsequently rebounded due to buying by European exporters and short covering. As a result, yesterday's closing prices rose by about one to two rupees each. It is also predicted that the market will open higher by half a rupee today.

### Finance: Gold Market Rises Sharply After Falling

Yesterday, the gold market in the black market surprisingly defied the weakening exchange rate, reversing its decline and trending upwards. Cash prices fluctuated repeatedly, breaking through the 11,000 yuan mark and then falling back below it. The market was uneasy. Initially, due to the reported weakening of exchange rates, market sentiment was weak, and the price fell to a low of 10,700 yuan. Soon after, two Chinese banks secretly started buying again, and Hong Kong banks continued to absorb supply. Tianjin banks, which had dumped over 1,000 taels the previous day, suddenly started buying again, driving up prices. At noon, the price rebounded to the 11,000 yuan mark. In the afternoon, Shanghai West banks also started buying, pushing the price to a high of 11,360 yuan. Later, upon hearing of a decline in yarn prices, selling pressure increased, eventually pushing the price back down to 11,200 yuan, still up 200 yuan. The total volume traded for the day was about 910 taels. Securities firms and money changers successively bought October gold certificates. There were more buyers than sellers of drafts, and the price rose from a morning opening of 8,200 yuan to 8,540 yuan, a gain of 270 yuan. The volume traded was about 2,000 taels. Ornamental gold initially fell to 1,100 yuan, but later rose to 1,150 yuan before settling at 1,140 yuan, up 10 yuan.

11,000 Yuan In and Out

Spot gold in the black market rose after falling, entering and then breaking out of the 11,000 yuan mark. The morning started with a decline, continuing the previous day's weakness. Wanfeng sold 10 taels to Jufengyong for 10,750 yuan, down 250 yuan. Then, Wanfeng offered 10 taels to Yongfengyu at an even lower price of 10,700 yuan. Tianyuan, Heshengde, and Da Lai aggressively bought, pushing the price to 10,900 yuan, up 200 yuan. Then, Tianyuan started selling again, and Yongchengyi, Yuanhecheng, and Dafeng competed to sell, causing a drop of 70 yuan. Tianyuan offered 100 taels to Xiangyu and Yong at 10,830 yuan. Xiangyu and Yongfengyong bought, and then Defu bought again. Shixiang and Hexiang also bought. At noon, the price rose even more sharply, rebounding beyond the 11,000 yuan mark, up 300 yuan. Xiangyu sold 20 taels to Xianghe, and Defu sold 10 taels, pushing the price to 11,130 yuan. After Xiangyu sold again, the noon close was pushed down to 11,100 yuan. In the afternoon, Defu came back to cover shorts, immediately pushing the price up 180 yuan, and then began buying 30 taels to Gonghe at 11,280 yuan. Hengji sold at 11,270 yuan. Deda, Mingfeng, Defu, Tianyuan, Tongkangyong, and a certain jewelry store bought, pushing the price up another 90 yuan. Litai bought 20 taels from Decheng, and Tianyuan and Yongcheng bought 10 taels each, reaching 11,360 yuan. Yongcheng, Chengda, Gonghe, Xiangyu, and Xianghe competed to sell, causing another drop of 160 yuan. Finally, Decheng sold 10 taels to a certain gold shop, and the evening close was 11,200 yuan, up 200 yuan from the 10th. The daily range was 660 yuan. After the close, there were sellers at 11,180 yuan. The total volume traded for the day was about 910 taels. The retail price of gold bars at gold shops was 11,300 yuan, 300 yuan higher than the buying price.

Futures Sentiment Positive and Promising

Since the morning, the October contract (10 taels) opened at 9:30, down 50 yuan, at 8,200 yuan. Dafeng aggressively bought, immediately pushing the price up to 8,280 yuan. Suddenly, Chengda, Hengji, and Xinfengyong began selling, immediately reducing the price by 60 yuan, to 8,220 yuan. At noon, due to the rebound in cash prices, the price also rose to 70 yuan in the buying spree of Shunyuan, Hesheng, Xiangxing, and Yongchi, resulting in the noon close price. The afternoon opening was down 20 yuan, at 8,450 yuan. Shunyuan and Dafeng aggressively bought, immediately pushing the price to 8,540 yuan. Hengji and Cheng hurriedly sold to 8,770 yuan. Finally, due to the positive sentiment, Dafeng and Tianyuan bought, and the 4:00 PM close was 8,520 yuan, a rebound of 270 yuan. The daily range was 340 yuan.

Jewelry Gold Retreated and Then Advanced

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at jewelry stores: Datonghang and Xintonghang initially listed at 30 yuan lower at 9:30 AM, at 1,100 yuan. Shortly after, the price rose three times, listing at 1,140 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the listed price rose to 1,150 yuan, and the 4:00 PM close was 1,140 yuan, up 10 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 50 yuan.

### Rumors of USD Supply Alter Black Market

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC listing all exchange rates flat. HSBC and other smaller counters remained unchanged. The black market rates for GBP and USD unexpectedly reversed and rebounded, after exporters sold USD at 3.375 to a certain bank. Suddenly, rumors circulated that HSBC was supplying USD, and the price had fallen back to the edge of the 30 yuan mark. Importers adopted a wait-and-see approach, suspending activity. Exporters and Chinese merchants had an offer of USD 5,000 at 3.50, but there were no buyers, and the trend was towards a decline. The noon close was 3.625, but it was not certain that it could be sold at that price. GBP was 2/1875, down 25 from the previous day's evening close. GBP long was down 1.25. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

Hong Kong, 15th (Wednesday) - This morning, the foreign exchange market opened with unusual sluggishness, and there were no significant changes in any exchange rates. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

Tianjin, 15th (Wednesday) - This morning, the foreign exchange market opened flat. The London telegraphic transfer rate remained unchanged. The New York telegraphic transfer rate was tighter by 0.125, at 4.875. The Shanghai exchange rate was down by 0.50, at 95 yuan. The black market rate for "Federal Reserve Notes" was down by 1.125, at 43.50 yuan.

### USD Plunges, Abundant Supply Where Profit Lies

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw relatively stable GBP and gold pounds. There was strong demand for GBP drafts, and market prices surged by six yuan. USD drafts saw a sudden drop in sentiment after a certain bank sold through the interbank market, with rumors circulating that the bank had a large supply of USD. The evening market had retreated to 30.07, a drop of 0.50 from the previous day. The supply and demand for Hong Kong drafts was relatively balanced, and market prices remained stable. Gold yen drafts remained at the original price of 2.60. Korean drafts showed a slight upward trend, rising to 2.11 in the evening market.

In other news, the USD draft, after gradually retreating from a peak of around 35 yuan to just over 31 yuan, fell further to just over 30 yuan yesterday afternoon. The reason for the decline is said to be that in Hong Kong, each USD draft is only worth around 24 yuan in legal tender. Some people, seeing the potential for profit, are privately carrying USD 50 and 100 drafts (in small numbers) to Shanghai to sell. Each USD 100 draft can generate a profit of 600-700 yuan in legal tender. It is easy for each traveler to carry a few USD 100 drafts. As long as there is money to be made, they don't care about the danger. The decline in the USD draft is not unrelated to this.

### Securities: Chinese Stocks Show Glimmers of Prosperity, Domestic Bonds Suffer Another Setback

The black market for government bonds was initially firm yesterday but then weakened, and sentiment remained uncertain. Although Sichuan banks had stopped selling, overseas Chinese suddenly offered spot sales, and the bond market, which had shown signs of recovery, suffered another blow. Class C bonds once again broke through the 70 yuan mark. In addition, the breakdown of US-Japan talks added to the market's weakness. The situation is that whenever there is a decision to rise, spot goods flow out, so the future is not easy to be optimistic about. In the morning, Xinhua, Xinzhi, Lianhe, and Tiansheng bought Class C bonds, opening at a price 0.40-0.50 higher. However, Hengkang, Yitai, Tongshun, and Jiufeng sold, and the noon close returned to 0.40 higher. In the afternoon, Xinfu continued to buy, and Lianyi, Tongshun, Shengxing, and Niuda bought. Class C bonds opened at 0.06 higher, 0.02 better than the noon close. However, Jiufeng, Runde, Yitai, Xiexing, Yuanrenchang, Tongkang, etc., sold on behalf of overseas Chinese or financial institutions, causing the price to fall in a straight line from 0.06, plunging by more than one yuan. The initial budding was damaged again, and the 70 yuan mark was broken again. As a result, except for Class B bonds, which were slightly higher by 0.05, other types declined by 0.20-0.30. The total volume traded was approximately 1.8-1.9 million yuan. A simplified table of Chinese listings is below.

Stock trading: 200 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity were traded at a price of 19 yuan per share. Recently, there has been extremely high demand for various Chinese stocks. Yongchang alone has registered demand for no fewer than dozens of types, such as financial stocks: Zhejiang Xingye at 200 yuan, Jin City at 190 yuan, Salt Industry at 200 yuan, China Reclamation at 105 yuan, Guohua at 97.5 yuan, and Guohuo at 80 yuan; textile stocks: Qingfeng at 230 yuan, Guangqin at 175.5 yuan, and Wing On at 230 yuan; pharmaceutical stocks: Wuzhou at 215 yuan, Zhongxi at 100 yuan, and Xinya at 51 yuan; ABC Underwear old shares at 18 yuan and new shares at 16 yuan; others such as Commercial Press at 210 yuan, China Bookstore at 115 yuan, Longzhang Paper at 110 yuan, China Cement at 100 yuan, Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate at 260 yuan, Tianli Light Gas at 95 yuan, Meilin Canned Food at 200 yuan, Great China Rubber at 200 yuan, China Coal Mine at 200 yuan, and Guanshengyuan at 95 yuan. These are just the most prominent examples, and the demand is extremely high, but there is no supply. As for the other small stocks, the demand is also high. This only refers to Yongchang's agency. Other firms can be inferred accordingly. The stock market has become prosperous, entirely due to the continuous rise in prices.

The Public Industry Association stock market was also active, with a trend from stable to firm. Multiple stocks rebounded. Reclamation and planting shares saw the largest volume, with a high price of 56 yuan and a closing price of 55.5 yuan. Asian shares also reached a high of 24.25 yuan, but quickly retreated by around one yuan. Rubber shares trended weaker but rebounded slightly at the close.

London, 14th (Tuesday) - Today, Chinese foreign bonds and the listed prices of British companies in the Far East were generally flat. Only the shares of the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China rose by 1 shilling and 3 pence, to a price of £9.50. There were no other changes.

### Oil Market: Oil Merchants Persist in Manipulation, Edible Oil Rises as Soon as It Falls

Yesterday's edible oil rose as soon as it fell. Initially, the market was quiet due to sluggish actual sales, and sentiment was weak, causing prices to fall by 4-5 yuan. Subsequently, buyers emerged at low prices, absorbing supply and causing prices to rebound, resulting in a similar outcome as before. It is reported that 40 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 50 barrels of soy oil, 130 loads of Qing oil from Dayou Factory, 200 loads of rapeseed oil, 400 loads of rapeseed oil from Taishan Factory, 500 loads of rapeseed oil from Lide Factory, 2 loads of rapeseed oil from Dasheng Factory, and 100 barrels of rapeseed oil from Rihua Factory were sold.

### Grains: Major Holders Reluctant to Sell Much, Rice Prices Do Not Fall Significantly

Yesterday, the surge in foreign rice prices was thwarted, and market prices across the board rebounded to flat. However, major holders were still reluctant to sell in large quantities, and new, smaller speculators were still trying to profit from small price fluctuations, so market prices did not fall excessively. The market opened in the morning with news that a 2,000-ton deal for foreign rice had been settled, calming sentiment. There was also talk of the Municipal Council agreeing to a price of 39.76 for 2,500 tons of small grain via telegram. In addition, there was a supply of public warehouse small grain and publicly sold small grain in the local market. Actual sales sharply decreased, and the customer market was also sluggish, making speculators timid. The market once sharply declined by 3-5 yuan in a selling spree. Subsequently, short covering and inventory accumulation caused the market to rebound. Small grain from external warehouses once fell to 130 yuan, and the noon close price was 132 yuan. The afternoon remained at 132 yuan, slightly lower by 2-3 yuan from the previous day. Yinghua's immediate shipment of small grain was 161 yuan, and spot goods were 154.5-153.5 yuan, also slightly lower by one yuan. By the close, grade 1 Saigon high-grade rice rebounded to 148 yuan, ordinary to 146 yuan, middle grade to 143-144 yuan, grade 2 to 132-134 yuan, grade 1 Siam to 142 yuan, grade 2 white to 131 yuan, and falling to 129.5 yuan. Mintang high-grade rice was 140 yuan, 138 yuan, middle grade 135-133 yuan. Java top-grade special was 143 yuan, and ordinary was 140 yuan. Broken top-grade ranged from 108.5 yuan, falling to 105.5 yuan. 500 tons and nearly 10,000 bags were traded.

The Taikoo Company's Hanyang vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying a batch of foreign rice from Hong Kong, totaling 13,877 bags, of which 11,700 bags were low-priced foreign rice for the Municipal Council. The vessel docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession, and unloading began yesterday afternoon. (Ancestral)

The market for new and old japonica rice was mixed, with some prices rising and some falling. As new rice from Xixin went to market, the supply of new goods increased, no less than 200-300 stones. However, local store sales were limited, so supply exceeded demand, and the market could not stand firm, depreciating by about 2 yuan. It is reported that Kunshan new japonica was 153-154 yuan, and Qingjiaoya species was 153-154 yuan. The situation for Nangang early broken rice was the opposite. As the end of the season approached, inland inventories were running out, so there was a risk that deliveries would not be sustained. However, store sales had broad needs, often feeling that supply was insufficient. Because this situation was different from that of new rice, it was able to stand firm, without any significant changes, continuing to open at 157-154 yuan. New Shejian was lacking in supply and there was no market.

Although the supply of glutinous rice was also scarce, market prices have already risen repeatedly, and the market has reached sufficient levels. Therefore, the pullback in foreign rice prices caused retail demand to stall, and prices fell by one or two yuan. Hong Kong white high grade rice opened at 150 yuan, and dropped to 157 yuan. Glutinous tea was only specially offered at 144 yuan.

### Customer Market Takes Advantage of the Flat Prices to Re-Accumulate; Foreign Vermicelli Rebounded in the Afternoon

Yesterday morning, the foreign vermicelli market was quite flat, with prices hovering around 0.30-0.20 yuan. In the afternoon, customer market dealers and major holders took advantage of the flat prices to re-accumulate inventory, and the market rebounded again, with Gold Dragon vermicelli seeing the most vigorous buying and the strongest gains. In the morning, West Warehouse Gold Dragon was only 38.8-39 yuan, but in the afternoon, it rose to 39.6 yuan. In the East Warehouse, it was only 39-39.12 yuan in the morning, but it rose to 40 yuan in the afternoon, both up nearly one yuan from the previous day. Cannon brand was 40.05-40.05 yuan in the morning, and 40.07 yuan in the afternoon, also up by nearly half a yuan. Double Eagle was 39.1 yuan, Red Sun Day was 39.5 yuan, Clock Tower was 39.05 yuan, Fortune God was 39.2 yuan, and Five Swallows rose to 39.7 yuan. Total volume traded, including internal and external, was no less than 50,000 bags.

### Bran and Wheat Supply Still Lacking

Bran has been rising continuously. Yesterday, customer market dealers continued to raise prices to accumulate inventory, and small bags rose by one yuan to 41 yuan. Due to scarce inventory, holders called for 42 yuan across the board.

Deliveries of wheat have been limited for several days. Holders have repeatedly engaged in speculation, and major factories such as Rihua have found it difficult to buy. Yesterday, a small factory offered a new high price of 65 yuan, managing to secure 1,300-1,400 bags of high-quality wheat.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Dominated by Speculation; Few Actual Sales, Prices Rise Again

Factory Cloth: The market was flat yesterday morning, but suddenly rose in the afternoon due to the influence of the speculative market. There was little actual buying, but holders' momentum suddenly strengthened, and prices were uniformly raised. Inventory holders also re-accumulated inventory. As a result, coarse cloth and twill rose by 0.50, fine cloth rose by 0.50-1 yuan, and the quoted prices for bleached and dyed cloth varied, also rising by around 0.50. Customer sales were limited to just over 100 pieces to the Yan-Jin gang in the North and 70-80 pieces of coarse cloth to the Dinghai gang in East Zhejiang. The local market remained dominant, with a total volume of about 800 pieces traded.

Eastern Cloth: Futures trading at the exchange fell first and then rebounded. As a result, the current month's "Dragon Head" contract rose by 0.70, closing at 65.1 yuan. The November contract rose by 0.50, the December contract rose by 0.30, and the January contract only rose by 0.05. Therefore, based on the futures market, the increase was still soft, but the spot market was quite stable. Fine cloth and fine twill rose by about 1 yuan per piece. The evening close for the new factory orders of "Dragon Head" fine cloth was 68.3 yuan, and the new single for "Four Gentlemen" drill was 2.46.5.

### Sugar Market: Spot Sugar Slightly Looser

Yesterday, the sugar futures market remained sluggish, while the spot market showed signs of easing. The association's price fixing showed that the initial price for September imports of No. 24 coarse white sugar was 202 yuan, which then fell to 199 yuan to 193.5 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose again to 204 yuan to 2 yuan and a fraction. August was 200 yuan to 191 yuan, with the afternoon at 198 yuan to 200 yuan, the same degree of decline. July was 197 yuan, 195 yuan, and 191 yuan, with the afternoon at 197 yuan to 100 yuan. June was 190 yuan, May was 187 yuan. Hong Kong goods were 191 yuan, gradually falling to 85 yuan and 80 yuan, with the afternoon at 84 yuan to 86.5 yuan, a small increase of 2 yuan. Taikoo Car White HX mark was 182 yuan, with the afternoon at 189 yuan, a small increase of 1 yuan. A total of more than 32,000 bags were traded.

### The Authorities Should Swiftly Intervene in the Manipulation of Prices Using Their Powers

Hoping the Municipal Council Will Adopt Strict Measures, Importers and Citizens Are Willing to Assist

Foreign Public Opinion Strongly Supports the Current Foreign Exchange Management System

Since the black market for foreign exchange sharply contracted on the 13th, creating an unprecedentedly tense and chaotic situation, the greedy speculators have raised the prices of daily necessities again, greatly impacting people's lives. Therefore, all parties, both Chinese and foreign, are very worried. By yesterday, the value of the legal currency saw a rebound, and the black market exchange rate eased slightly. US dollar bills fell from 35 yuan to 30 yuan. However, food prices, which rose by 10% on the 14th, remained firm yesterday. If the relevant parties and the authorities in this city do not quickly find ways to remedy this serious situation, the future is truly unimaginable. The English-language "Finance & Commerce" weekly, published in this city, has considerable authority in discussing economic issues. Yesterday, it published two articles: one supporting the current foreign exchange management system, and the other suggesting the real reasons for rising prices and ways to remedy them. Both articles are notable for discussing the serious issues mentioned above. One of them stated that the Chinese authorities would never abandon Shanghai.

The Amount of Legal Currency Has Not Increased

The purpose of foreign exchange management is to maintain people's livelihood and industrial development, but not to waste it on non-essential goods. The Exchange Equalization Fund stipulates a preferential exchange rate to maintain the price level before July 26th. However, unscrupulous merchants are using various excuses to raise prices, which is not the fault of the Exchange Equalization Fund. It is hoped that the authorities can adopt strict measures to deal with this during this extraordinary period to alleviate the suffering of the people. Another article stated that the amount of legal currency in circulation has not increased, and the claim of currency inflation is demonstrably inaccurate. Now that merchants are using the excuse of reduced foreign exchange supply for non-essential goods to raise prices, they should be punished quickly. First, it is hoped that citizens will immediately stop purchasing and hoarding goods. Second, the Municipal Council should, in conjunction with importers, announce the prices of various imported goods and the names of stores willing to sell at prices fixed with legitimate pure profit, in order to stop hoarding for profit. It is believed that there will be a good response. The gist of the two articles is excerpted below.

The Shanghai Market Must Be Maintained

The gist of the article "Supporting the Current Foreign Exchange Management System" is roughly as follows: First, the Chinese authorities will never abandon the Shanghai market. As evidenced by past facts, the Chinese government is unwilling to abandon Shanghai to the Japanese, so it can be seen that it will continue to support it, but with limitations. At the same time, it is also extremely concerned about all situations that may affect the lives of Shanghai citizens and industrial development. Much of Shanghai's trade is very helpful to the wartime economy of Free China and the coastal areas. The final destination of most imported goods entering Shanghai is still Free China. At the same time, most of the factories in this city accept orders from customers in Free China. The Chinese government is doing its utmost to maintain the Shanghai market, but does not want to waste a penny on non-essential goods. The value of the legal currency of Free China does not need any support, because the arbitrary value of the legal currency for foreign trade has been recognized by friendly countries (i.e., Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union). The legal currency of Free China is a tool for clearing international accounts and a standard for implementing barter trade. The extent to which the supply of foreign exchange for essential goods to Shanghai must be maintained so as not to harm the main interests of Shanghai can only be proven through experience. We must be able to wait for the trial period to pass.

Export Bills Should Be Provided

The main question worth studying is how to obtain export bills of exchange in British and American currency from exporters. Cooperation with banks in democratic countries has now been achieved. All exporters in democratic countries will sell their foreign exchange to their domestic banks, so that the Exchange Equalization Fund can cope with it abundantly. However, most exporters only provide a small portion of their export bills of exchange, and some do not provide them at all. On the other hand, some export firms allocate huge amounts of their foreign exchange to maintain their foreign branches. At the same time, insurance premiums and exporters' investments must also be deducted from export bills of exchange. The following figures are very important for estimating the foreign exchange currently required by the import industry in Shanghai. Shanghai's trade with the British pound, US dollar, and Dutch guilder group has an average monthly loss of US$44 million this year. This loss is only theoretical, and the actual loss this year is more than this number. In the first eight months of this year, the total value of Shanghai's imports from the United Kingdom, the United States, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and India was US$88.6 million, and the total value of exports was US$53.5 million. In 1940, the total value of imports was US$100 million, and the total value of exports was US$37.7 million. If we compare Shanghai's trade deficit in 1941 with that in 1940, this year's deficit is US$35.2 million, and last year's deficit was US$62.3 million. Therefore, the progress in the trade balance between Shanghai and the British pound and US dollar group seems to be most noteworthy.

Price Standards Were Stipulated Earlier

In order to curb the rise in prices in Shanghai, the Exchange Equalization Fund, with the consent of the central government, stipulated a preferential exchange rate for legal currency. This decision on the preferential exchange rate for specially permitted imported goods aims to maintain the prices of goods imported from democratic countries at the level before the United States announced the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds on July 26. In fact, all approved imported goods, except for slight increases due to freight and insurance premiums, are sold by foreign import firms at old prices. These importers mostly use various methods to obtain bills of exchange for prohibited imported goods, and sell them at high prices. Although stores and retailers continue to receive goods from importers at prices from July, these retailers have greatly increased their prices. They do not explain the reasons for the continued price increases. This is blatant monopoly profiteering and open exploitation. The general hoarders' refusal to release goods is also one of the reasons for the chaotic situation. Importers are not in a position to overstep their roles and interfere with their business. The only authority (the Municipal Council) still refuses to recognize its responsibility for this issue. In this extraordinary period, it must be dealt with with extraordinary means. The Municipal Council was granted greater powers by the ratepayers' meeting last spring, and is no longer restricted by ratepayers. It should quickly take new measures to adapt to the new needs. If the authorities in this city do not take any action, millions of Chinese and thousands of foreigners will undoubtedly encounter major misfortunes this winter. The developments in the past few days are very similar to the prologue to the great tragedy of hyperinflation experienced by the people of European countries in the years after the end of World War I in 1918. Investment merchants in this city are doing their best to get rid of legal currency, and most people are withdrawing their deposits, unknowingly becoming hoarders, which has led to rising prices. If this irrational state of terror continues to exist, the economic life of Shanghai will be destroyed.

Currency Inflation is Absolutely Inaccurate

The gist of the article "The Real Reasons for Rising Prices and Suggestions for Remedies" is that, due to the developments of the past week, it is believed that Shanghai has entered a period of currency inflation. This statement is not credible. The key lies in the lack of confidence in the currency, but those with long-term vision believe that it is completely unreasonable. Although legal currency cannot be used to freely purchase foreign exchange temporarily, is the Japanese military scrip any different? However, hoarders and speculators are accustomed to the effectiveness of Japanese military scrip, so they can maintain a favorable value. The smuggling of legal currency to Shanghai is an unwelcome and unfortunate situation. Now that the post office has prohibited remittances, the smuggling has gradually decreased. Therefore, it can be asserted that the amount of legal currency in circulation has not increased significantly in the past two months. At the same time, the exchange of legal currency for other currencies has been prohibited. However, in the months before the freezing order was issued, Chinese foreign funds had been sent back to the country, and the Chinese demand for foreign exchange was only for trade purposes. In view of the above circumstances, it is not enough to explain currency inflation.

The Hoarding Situation is Extremely Bizarre

Since the supply of foreign exchange applied for can be normal, the foreign exchange situation is gradually becoming clear. However, at the same time, Shanghai should also find ways to stop the continued rise in prices, which is the top priority. Most major importers claim that the prices of their goods are not higher than before the freezing order was issued on July 26. However, they admit that retailers have raised prices by 150% to 200%. In fact, there is no shortage of inventory, because when the President Pierce and President Coolidge recently arrived in Shanghai, importers had goods to replenish. However, the situation has developed to a bizarre point. For example, leather merchants buy coal, and cotton merchants hoard cigarettes. Almost all small merchants also engage in side businesses, hoarding goods and waiting for good prices to sell.

The Authorities Should Have Responsible Measures

Importers object to this situation and express their willingness to retail, but they admit that they cannot control the activities of most small merchants and are victims themselves. They should find practical ways to protect themselves as soon as possible, on the one hand to prevent merchants from obtaining illegal profits, and at the same time not to rely on terror psychology to compete to increase purchases of goods at high prices. It has been suggested that buyers should organize and take direct action to boycott stores that do not sell goods at fair and reasonable prices, but we cannot agree. We only advocate that citizens have a united mind to break the merchants' monopoly and profiteering, and that the Municipal Council should come forward to preside over it, with the assistance of importers, to announce the prices of various imported goods and the names of stores willing to sell at fixed prices. It is believed that citizens will welcome and support this measure. If it can become a reality, the current inflated prices will soon fall, and there will be a good response from all parties.

### Internal Transfer of Floating Capital Increases Daily, Exchange Rate Fluctuates

In recent months, the internal transfer of floating capital in Shanghai has gradually increased. After various Sichuan banking groups founded this period and came up with loans, they encouraged the internal transfer of floating capital. Therefore, the number of remittances to Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang and other places is increasing day by day. This can be evidenced by the fluctuations in the exchange rate between Shanghai and Chongqing. In the past, remittances from Shanghai to Chongqing only needed to pay 700 yuan in legal currency to collect 1,000 yuan in Chongqing and Kunming. However, recently, it has risen to require 870 yuan to be paid in Shanghai to collect 1,000 yuan in Chongqing or Kunming.

### The Three President Liners Renamed General

Van Buren's Maiden Voyage Arrives Here, Shanghai-US Freight Transportation is Undoubtedly Closer

The head office of the American President Lines recently decided to rename all three liners belonging to the company. The President Pierce has been renamed General Scott, the President Cleveland has been renamed General Breslin, and the President Taft has been renamed General Holbrook. According to shipping industry news, the dates of arrival in Shanghai of these three liners have been roughly determined. The General Breslin will arrive in Shanghai from Nanyang next week and sail to the United States. The General Holbrook is scheduled to sail to the United States in mid-November, and the General Scott will sail from Shanghai to San Francisco in early December. It is understood that the most recent ship to sail from Shanghai to the United States is the President Dollar, which is currently staying in Manila. The date of arrival in Shanghai is said to be October 27. The President Van Buren (Van Buren), which is coming to Shanghai and Hong Kong from San Francisco, is newly completed this year, with a deadweight of 16,000 tons and a net weight of 9,400 tons. It is tall and wide, and its style is novel, which is unmatched by the President Cleveland and President Pierce. The date of the maiden voyage to Shanghai is in late this month. American liners in the Far East and the Pacific will increase, and Shanghai-US shipping will become closer.

### The Situation of the Tax Negotiations in the Western District is Still Difficult to Disclose

The North China Daily News said that it is rumored that the Municipal Council and the central district have made great progress after a long period of negotiations on the issue of tax revenue on cross-border road construction in the western district of the Public Concession, and that an agreement is expected to be reached soon. Regarding this statement, this reporter recently asked the spokesman of the Municipal Council, who replied that the talks between the two sides have not yet reached the stage where the Municipal Council can issue a press release.

### Shanghai Passengers on Ships to Hong Kong Pay Security Deposits

Two Shipping Companies Have Different Methods

Since the Hong Kong government announced the revocation of the privilege of agents in other ports to issue temporary Hong Kong entry permits, passengers traveling to Hong Kong in the future, in addition to holding Chinese passports or formal entry permits, must pay a cash guarantee. A reporter from the New Life News Agency learned from the British Taikoo Jardine two shipping companies and the China Travel Service yesterday: (1) Taikoo Company stipulates that a cash guarantee must be paid, 50 yuan for official cabins, 100 yuan for large cabins, and 25 yuan for bunks in the third class cabin (all calculated in Hong Kong dollars). This cash can be paid in Hong Kong dollar cash or bills of exchange from British and American banks. (2) Jardine Company does not accept the method of collecting security deposits. Those who purchase tickets for the company's ships to Hong Kong must have a passport or formal entry permit. (3) In order to facilitate passengers, China Travel Service plans to directly collect security deposits from passengers. After completing the entry procedures in Hong Kong, they can return the security deposits to the Hong Kong branch. This matter has been discussed with the Hong Kong Immigration Bureau and has not been accepted. The company has previously applied for Hong Kong six-month entry permits for passengers, and has now decided to stop applying for them from today, and will wait for a telegram from Hong Kong before deciding whether to continue. However, it can still apply for passport business, because those who hold passports can land in Hong Kong.

### Hunting Area Reduced in the Suburbs of Shanghai

A spokesman for the Japanese army in Shanghai announced new regulations for hunting in the suburbs of Shanghai, stating that those who wish to hunt must apply to the Shanghai Japanese Garrison Command before November 1, and the Japanese army reserves the right to prohibit hunting in any area without prior notice. The area allowed for hunting this season is smaller than last year, starting from the Suzhou River in the north, ending at the Huangpu River in the south, starting from about three miles west of Hongqiao Airport in the east, and ending at the Qian River, which passes through Guanyintang and Songjiang, etc., in the west. The entire area is slightly rectangular.

### The National Medical People's Hospital Hopes for Donations from All Walks of Life

The Shanghai National Medical People's Hospital at 88 Robison Road, Shanghai, was opened in July last year and has been in operation for more than a year. The number of outpatients is two or three hundred a day, and each patient is charged only two jiao for registration. The hospital also has 120 beds, and the number of inpatients is usually full. Those who can afford it are charged only one yuan per person per day for meals. In addition, medical and pharmaceutical expenses are not charged at all. It is purely charitable in nature. Inpatients have resident doctors on duty day and night to treat them, and nurses on duty day and night in shifts. As for sanitary facilities, everything is complete. Electric stoves are used for decocting medicines, which is clean. As for the spaciousness of the hospital buildings and the freshness of the air, it is the best among the hospitals in Shanghai. However, the monthly expenses are at least more than 10,000 yuan, which all depends on donations from philanthropists in Shanghai to maintain it. Recently, due to the high prices of rice, medicines, water, electricity, etc., it is difficult to make ends meet. It is hoped that all philanthropists will donate generously to maintain it for a long time, which is immeasurable merit.

### Shanghai Churches Strictly Prohibit Clergymen from All Over from Participating in Political Issues, Statement by the General Agent of the French Church

The church groups in this city recently paid close attention to the news that the German missionaries in Changsha would be evacuated. De Tour, the general agent of the French Catholic Church in China, especially sent a letter to the North China Daily News yesterday, detailing the activities of the missionaries in Changsha. He said that the refugee hospital established by the Catholic Church in Changsha was founded by French nuns serving in the Hong En Hospital and the Sacred Heart Hospital in Shanghai and Father Rao, the host of the refugee area in Nanshi. Later, due to the evacuation of the French missionaries, German and Italian missionaries took over the work. The Shanghai Church authorities have stated that they strictly prohibit clergymen from all over from interfering in political issues, and all work is limited to religious and charitable undertakings. There are missionaries of 24 nationalities serving in Catholic churches all over China. Therefore, the fact that German missionaries echoed the Japanese planes flying over Changsha is a threat to the safety of German and Italian missionaries in Free China.

### Police and Bandits Fight on Rue Bayle, Four People Killed, Including Hostage and French Police; Three Bandits Abduct Victim on North Soochow Road and Flee to French Concession; Victim Cries for Help, Shot Dead in Car; Bandits Resist Arrest; Two French Police Officers Killed; One Bandit Killed, One Wounded, One Captured

At about 10 PM last night, a man surnamed Wang was having dinner at a restaurant on North Soochow Road in the Public Concession when he was suddenly accosted by three bandits who brandished guns, dragged him into a car parked on the side of the road, and sped south. When they reached Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, they drove straight west. When they reached the intersection of Route Petain and Avenue Wha Ling, the man surnamed Wang

Cried for Help, The bandits, fearing things would go wrong, shot and killed the man in the car. The bandits got out of the car and fled northwest. Nearby Chinese police heard the alarm and chased after them. The bandits opened fire to resist arrest. At this time, the French police also received a report and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to rush to the scene to assist in the pursuit and returned fire with their guns.

Chasing Closely The bandits fled to the intersection of Rue Bayle and Route du Pere Huc, when suddenly a French patrol officer (No. 104) and a Vietnamese officer from the French police station came riding bicycles. The bandits immediately opened fire on the two officers. The French officer and the Vietnamese officer were caught off guard and were shot in vital areas. They fell off their vehicles and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely.

Killed on the Spot Two bandits seized the bicycles ridden by the two officers, rode on them and continued to flee. Another bandit also followed the two bandits, continuing to fire to resist arrest. When the bandit was chased by detectives to the intersection of Route Cardinal Mercier and Rue Jules Pasteau, two bandits were shot and wounded by Chinese police officer No. 26. One bandit was shot in a vital area and died on the spot. Another bandit was shot in the leg

Fell to the Ground and Was Captured Two box cannons and dozens of bullets were found. Another bandit was also captured by detectives. Afterwards, the police summoned ambulances to send the French patrol officer, the Vietnamese officer, and the hostage who was killed to the Guangci Hospital. Because they could not be saved, the bodies were transferred to the coroner's office. The wounded bandit was also sent to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. When the bandits and detectives fought, both sides fired about 30 shots. Fortunately, there were few pedestrians in the area at the time, and no one was injured.

Bandits Seize Car At about 10:30 PM last night, a Silver Automobile Company taxi (No. 18292) was stopped on Kiukiang Road near Chekiang Road by bandits who threatened the driver with guns. The driver was forced out of the car, and the bandits got into the car and sped away. Whether the car was seized by the bandits is related to the kidnapping case on North Soochow Road has not been confirmed.

### Regarding Car Owners Purchasing More from Stockpilers, Leading to a Gasoline Black Market; Company Hopes Car Owners Will Not Disrupt Pricing Themselves and Wait for Sufficient Reserves to Eliminate Rationing

A mainland report states: Yesterday (the 14th), it was learned that after the black market dollar price recently showed a tendency to rise, the gasoline black market also soared accordingly. Those selling gasoline on the black market are all gasoline stockpilers. Car owners, because the gasoline allocated to them each month is insufficient for their needs, purchase additional gasoline from stockpilers at high prices. Stockpilers, seeing the rise in the dollar price, then raise gasoline prices, at least doubling the official selling price. According to a certain employee of the Asiatic Petroleum Company speaking to reporters, they are also aware of the occurrence of a gasoline black market. This situation is actually caused by car owners purchasing additional gasoline from stockpilers. If car owners understand the oil company's point of view and follow the rationing system, they will not be exploited by stockpilers. The Asiatic Company is already aware that some employees at the company's various filling stations are stealing gasoline and selling it on the black market. The employee continued, The Asiatic Company now hopes that overseas gasoline will arrive, so that it can alleviate the tense gasoline situation here. At least three months are needed. This hope should encourage car owners in the city to conserve gasoline during periods of shortage. Once the company has sufficient reserves, it intends to cancel the rationing method. At the same time, it hopes that car owners will no longer purchase stolen gasoline, so as not to fuel criminal behavior and further reduce reserves.

### New Clothing Stores Temporarily Closed Yesterday

All employees of various new clothing stores on Fujian Road, New Road, Avenue Joffre, etc., once jointly went on strike last year due to unsuccessful requests for salary increases. Later, after the management agreed to salary increases, an agreement was signed and work resumed. A year has passed. Now, because of the increasing living expenses, the employees' livelihoods are feeling strained. They have jointly submitted another request to the management for an increase in wages and a series of increases from 1.3% to 3.3%. However, the management only agreed to three types of salary increases: 3%, 4%, and 5.3%. The labor side ultimately did not agree and firmly demanded an increase in the series. Because no agreement was reached, they announced a joint strike starting yesterday. All the new clothing stores were temporarily closed.

### Two False Witnesses Blamed for Pushing Passenger to Death; Judge Formally Indicts; Separate Interrogation Indicates Remand for Further Review

Wang Wanxiang, ticket seller number 358 on British-owned trolleybus number B-352 on route 20, was found to have pushed passenger Xiang Dongchuan out of the bus at Weihaiwei Road and Tongfu Road around 1:30 p.m. on September 13th due to pocketing fares, causing Xiang to fall and fracture his skull, resulting in death. After investigation by Judge Shi Meiyu of the First Special Court, Wang Wanxiang was sentenced on September 26th for injury resulting in death and sentenced to life imprisonment. During the trial of the case, a certain fugitive ticket seller and ticket seller number 241, Mi Baolin, instigated Yan Defa to testify falsely in court, attacking the testimony of eyewitnesses Jiang Jing and Xu Shenjin, claiming that the bus bell was rung by Jing because the passenger fell to his death, and fearing imprisonment, he came forward to testify. Subsequently, after Judge Shi, who was handling the case, discovered Yan's false testimony, he immediately detained him and handed him over to the prosecutor's office for investigation. Prosecutor Wu summoned ticket seller number 241, Mi Baolin, who again denied instigating Yan Defa to give false testimony, but the evidence was solid and undeniable. Prosecutor Wu then detained him as well. Yesterday morning, he filed a public lawsuit against Yan Defa for perjury, and against Mi Baolin for instigation. Judge Zhong presided over the trial, conducting separate interrogations for about an hour and a half. The defendants' testimonies differed, and they all tried their best to shirk responsibility, fearing punishment. After reviewing the circumstances, the court ordered them to be remanded and the trial rescheduled.

The fire brigade was alerted and dispatched vehicles to put out the fire, but the houses there were all constructed of wood and easily combustible, making firefighting difficult.

Educational News

### Joint Enrollment Results of National Southwestern Associated University, Wuhan University, Zhejiang University, and Central University; Poor Performance of Applicants, Only One-Quarter Admitted

(Chongqing, Havas World Telegraph, 14th) Regarding the state of education in inland China, some educators are deeply concerned about the current state of secondary education. According to the joint enrollment results of National Southwestern Associated University, Wuhan University, Zhejiang University, and Central University, of the 6,706 applicants, only 1,788 were admitted after lowering the standards. Educators lament the decline of secondary education as a result. In terms of regions, Chongqing students were the worst, followed by Chengdu and Kunming. Hengyang and Guiyang were better. This shows that the local environment and living standards have a significant impact on education. The constant air raids in Chongqing have prevented students in various schools from attending classes on time, which is also one of the reasons for the poor performance. In terms of the majors sought by the applicants, only a little over 800 people aspired to enter the liberal arts and science colleges, accounting for one-seventh of the total. More than 2,000 people applied for law and engineering, and 1,436 for economics. Educators explain this by saying that there is an urgent need for engineering personnel in the nation-building effort, so hundreds of people apply to the various departments of the engineering college, which is a good phenomenon. As for the large number of people in the law and economics departments, this is because financial institutions and the business community offer particularly good treatment, which stimulates young people. It is not that young people in general have a special interest in these subjects.

### Twelfth Academic Lecture by Jiang Zhensheng (3)

D. (Harmony within the Body): The various parts of the body cooperate with each other. Food is digested by digestive juices, but the secretion of digestive juices relies on the cooperation of nerves and hormones to fully digest the food. Therefore, the movement of each organ and the entire physiological activity are very harmonious.

E. (Reproduction): The significance of reproduction is to increase the number of individuals and preserve the race. That is, a part of the parent body creates offspring. There are eight methods of reproduction. In asexual reproduction, organisms such as amoebas constantly proliferate by dividing in two, which is called "binary fission." Reproduction by budding is called "budding." The ability to regenerate a part is called "sporulation." In sexual reproduction, there is "conjugation," which involves joining the reproductive cells produced by the male and female to complete an individual. In general animals, the egg must combine with a sperm cell before it can produce offspring. The combination of the egg and sperm is called "fertilization." In some animals, the egg can develop on its own without the combination of sperm, which is called "parthenogenesis." However, this is only an exception. Fertilization in aquatic animals mostly takes place outside the body, while in birds and land animals, fertilization takes place inside the body, such as what humans do, which is called "viviparity." If there is "alternation of generations," that is, the alternation of sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction. However, in general, the reproduction rate of lower organisms exceeds that of higher organisms. Pigs can produce a litter, while humans only produce one or two.

F. (Growth): Growth is an increase in body mass, which is the result of somatic cell division. Cell division is also proliferation. The more cell divisions, the weaker the cells become. Eventually, most of the divisions stop. However, stopping the division does not mean dying immediately. However, after a certain period of time, they will inevitably perish. The regenerative ability of lower organisms is stronger than that of higher organisms because the structure of lower organisms is simple and easy to recover and heal.

G. (Stimulus and Response): A stimulus is the reaction of a living thing to an external stimulus, which is the basis of individuality in a living thing. The response varies with the evolution of animals. Lower animals only have physiological sensations, but the senses of smell and taste are already developed. Higher animals, such as humans, also have intellectual feelings such as aesthetic reasoning, as well as spiritual feelings such as language and expression. Therefore, the two senses of sight and hearing are extremely developed. The difference in sensation is related to the following four points: the development of the cerebral membrane, the complexity and simplicity of the nervous system structure, the size of nerve cells, and the weight of the cerebellum.

H. (Adaptation to the Environment): The purpose of adapting to the environment is to seek survival. Various adaptations are made to the ever-changing environment in order to adjust oneself to the environment, in order to seek the survival of the individual and the protection of the species.

Three. Conclusion

Regarding the basis of individuality in living things, the research is as follows: (1) The various parts of the cell have a precise arrangement. (2) Cell division has certain changes. (3) The living body has special chemical components. Therefore, living things are harmonious, complete, evolved, and upward. (End)

### Joking with German Radio

— Xia Chu

Recently, in order to boost domestic morale, Hitler made a special trip back to Berlin from the battlefield to broadcast his "self-criticism edict." The effectiveness of this speech is self-evident. However, much to the dismay of the Führer, listeners heard confused Russian interspersed within. This mysterious voice was universally referred to as "Ivan the Terrible"—Ivan the Terrible being the cruel Tsar of 16th-century Russia. Today, the voices of a dead Tsar and a living Führer can be heard together. The listeners of Hitler's speech are truly blessed.

The disruption suffered by German radio is not limited to this incident. Recently, German domestic news programs have often been interspersed with German from other sources, with the two sides responding to each other, much like a comedic duet. This has thoroughly undermined the news being propagated by the Germans. Some examples:

News report: The German army has won another great victory...

Interjection: A victory in the grave.

Report: Fifteen Soviet aircraft have been shot down...

Comment: What about German planes?

Report: German aircraft launched another large-scale attack last night...

Interjection: Did any return to their original base?

Report: British aircraft attempted an attack...

Interjection: How ridiculous.

Report: The Italian Air Force attacked a British warship...

Interjection: Don't make people laugh their stomachs out.

Report: The Führer's headquarters issued a communiqué stating...

Interjection: Besides lies, what else is there?

Report: News report complete.

Interjection: The lies will continue to be broadcast tomorrow.

Almost every sentence of German news reports was followed by an interjection. This made Goebbels both angry and amused, and the propaganda effect was completely lost. It was later discovered that these interjections came from the powerful Soviet radio station RWL—located in Noginsk, thirty miles from Moscow. As for who was singing the duet with the German news reports, some speculate it was the former Austrian journalist Fischer, while others say it was Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Lozovsky, because Lozovsky not only mastered German but also enjoyed joking.

The Germans tried hard to eliminate these interjections, but to no avail. One tactic was to report the news very quickly, completing the entire report in one breath, leaving no room for interjections. While this prevented the duet, it turned the report into a tongue-twister. Could any listener understand what was being reported?

### Fulfilled Desire: A Lesson Learned

— Sifeng Guo

It was a spring afternoon. I lay on the hammock on the porch, letting the warm sun cover my whole body. A white-eye bird was constantly chirping in the pomegranate tree. The gentle spring breeze lulled me to sleep. My elder brother and cousin's voices were constantly noisy in my ears. The sound was flat, intermittent, and seemed to have no end. My sleep was disturbed and I was very unhappy.

"I have" days I want to commit suicide, "my cousin suddenly said. I couldn't help but feel strange. My cousin was my grandfather's only grandson, and his life was the envy of all of us. Thinking of suicide," Yes, suicide, "he continued:" What is the meaning of my life? No competition, no desire, whatever I want, I get it... "He suddenly stopped, lowered his voice," except for the thrill, the stimulation of life. "After speaking, he grabbed his hat and left. I looked at my elder brother in surprise. He smiled bitterly and said solemnly to me," Fulfilling desires is troubling. "I wanted to taste the meaning of this sentence, but I fell asleep.

One evening, I was walking home from school, feeling very relaxed. I casually looked around. A very bright light stimulated my eyes. Looking in that direction, it was a jewelry store window. Inside were many ornaments. In the middle of many jade, agate, beads, and necklaces, I saw a small ivory ring, carved very exquisitely. On the ring face was carved a small toad, its mouth open as if it were yelling. It was very vivid. The eyes, mouth, tongue, and the patterns on its back were very clear. The surroundings of the ring were also carved with shy flowers, with stems and leaves. It was lined with a black velvet box, which made it look even cleaner and more lovely. I saw that the size was just right for my finger. I really wanted to buy it, but the price tag was much larger than all the pocket money I had. After looking at it for a while, I had to go back.

Back home, I told my mother and asked her to buy it for me, but I was rejected. My mother said I shouldn't spend money on these kinds of gadgets. I was very unhappy when I heard this, and my desire to own it increased. I had to get it. I thought I could save my bus fare and snack money to buy it.

From then on, every morning I got up very early to prepare to walk to school, and I often walked home in the afternoon. I endured being hungry and didn't buy snacks. My mother laughed at me and didn't allow me to do this, so I hid it from her. Although I felt miserable, I was very happy in my heart. When I walked past that window, I always glanced at the ring, thinking that I could wear it soon. Two weeks later, I took the money and walked to the entrance of that window. The ring was gone. The shop assistant told me that they had sold it two days earlier. My heart was like being poured cold water. I ran home in one breath. When my mother asked me, I almost cried.

A few days later, I went to my aunt's house with my mother to play. I unintentionally saw that my aunt was wearing that ring on her hand. Her fat hands, rosy nails, and the little white toad crawling on it? It was so cute." I couldn't help but exclaimed. My mother saw that I was acting dumbfounded and immediately understood everything. She laughed and told my aunt my story. My aunt laughed loudly when she heard it. "Okay, since you like it so much, I can give it to you. But there is one condition. You have to help me copy three Diamond Sutras for my use in July. Otherwise, I won't give it."

Copying the Diamond Sutra is the most boring thing. It is very difficult to write on rough yellow paper with that non-sticky cinnabar. Those sentences are often meaningless and repetitive. After writing three hundred characters, my wrist would ache, and my eyes would involuntarily close. But I finally patiently finished writing the three Diamond Sutras. Thinking of that ivory ring, it seemed like there was a force encouraging me.

On the morning of the seventh lunar month, I got the ring. I was very happy in my heart. I quickly put it on my finger and stared at it for a while. Suddenly I felt a little displeased. My fingers were very thick, and there were many veins and bones on my hands. My nails were bald. A pale hand with a white ring looked very rough and dull: I looked at the little toad again. It was lying there stupidly. I remembered the toad behind the water tank, and I felt it was ugly. I hurriedly took off the ring and threw it in the drawer. I regretted that I had spent so much effort on it.

I lay silently in bed, thinking of what my brother said: "Fulfilling desires is troubling." I thought I understood the meaning of this sentence now.

Military Equipment

### Trackless Tank

— Kezhong

Recently, the American military authorities have been working hard to manufacture and improve all military equipment. Among the new weapons recently tested is a type of trackless tank, in which all vehicle wheels are not connected by tracks, but can still move freely up and down according to the terrain, making it more flexible than old-fashioned tracked tanks. After the new trackless tank was test-driven by the U.S. Army, it was decided to be remodeled into a large tank and equipped with appropriate weapons. It is said that this new type of tank can be used for reconnaissance.

13. Drifting to Shanghai

"I'm not worried about those few dilapidated houses, I really don't know where I should flee. Because I have very little money left, and I can't possibly buy land to farm elsewhere, so I still haven't made up my mind to leave."

"Dad, that might not be a bad idea." Mei Bao, who had been listening to them for a long time, couldn't help but interject. "I'm not a child anymore, and I've studied for a few years. No matter where I go, I can always do something to help you old man live. Heaven probably won't starve us to death!"

"Third Master, really, not only has Miss Mei Bao studied for so many years, she can always earn a few dollars when she goes out, and even you old man, don't you still know how to sing opera? Even if you are old and can't sing yourself, can't you teach opera or play the erhu for people, and then you can eat?" Little Gouzi said very enthusiastically.

Autumn Begonia shook his head.

"You don't know! There are wars everywhere now, who is in the mood to listen to opera?"

"No, Dad, there are exceptions! Bao昂 lifted his head, thought for a moment. "Last year I also heard a gentleman say that Shanghai is really a paradise. The French Concession and the Public Concession are dozens of times larger than the Tianjin Concession. There are large restaurants and theaters everywhere; even though there are wars outside, the people living inside don't have to worry at all. As long as you have money, anything can be done! If we just want to survive and don't ask anything else, Shanghai is a way out." (237)

### Autumn Season Strongmen of Various Storytelling Venues (Part 1)

— Jian Fan

It is customary for storytelling venues to hire famous storytellers and adjust their lineups during the Lunar New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival. The New Year's opening is called "New Year's Season," which must be told until around the Dragon Boat Festival. Starting from the Mid-Autumn Festival, it is called "Autumn Season," which must be told until the end of the year. This period is the peak season for storytelling venues, and if the lineup is strong, business will surely flourish. Therefore, the various storytelling venues compete fiercely to recruit strongmen of the storytelling world, leaving no stone unturned. The auditorium of the Cangzhou Hotel has been opened as a storytelling venue, and with its complete facilities and comfortable seating, it is often full. Zhang Yuan Ji started later, and recently opened a new storytelling venue, which opened on Double Ten Day. In addition, there is also the Da Luotian on Simalu Road, which was once converted into a storytelling venue three years ago, but it was very short-lived. Recently, it has reopened as a night storytelling venue. The Xu Hua's storytelling of the Guangrun two societies has added territory, and there is a great revival. However, Xia Hesheng and Zhang Hongsheng went to Su to perform half a month ago; Jiang Ruting and Zhu Jiesheng are still exclusively affiliated with radio broadcasts. The female storytellers of the Puyu Society, only Zai Meiyun, who is re-affiliated to the Nanjing storytelling venue, is most excited by the listeners. The following is a brief description of the strongmen of storytelling in the autumn lineup of each storytelling venue who have appeal:

Huang Yian is good at telling the story of West Chamber Record, which was formerly pushed by Zhu Lan'an, whose clear words were like jade, and still popular. He adapted the script of West Chamber, removing the dross and retaining the essence. The rhetoric is gorgeous, and the elegant rhyme is about to flow! He was hired by storytelling venues in other places, and he was heard everywhere. He returned to Shanghai last month. He is affiliated with Huyuanyuan and Longquanlou during the day, and Nanyuan, Yalu, and Baihuating at night. Except for Nanyuan's unique single block, the other four storytelling venues are combined with his disciple Qian Yanqiu's double block. The art of storytelling is good, and it never fails to be fascinating. Listeners praise it, only one person after Zhu Lan'an!

Shen Jian'an, the Zhu Ta's loud teller, Shen Jian'an, after breaking up with Xue Xiaoqing, took his proud disciple Li Nian'an to Changshu, Wuxi and other places to sing. This time he came back to Shanghai, affiliated to Zhang Yuan, Huyuanyuan, Nanyuan, Baihuating, and Fuchunlou during the day. Jian'an's storytelling is concise and relaxed, and he sings overlapping sentences in the Ma tune. His voice is louder than before, and the rhyme is profound! The future is indeed immeasurable.

Wang Shouzhang, who is good at telling the Record of Good and Evil Retribution, is Wang Shouqing's younger brother and the son of Wang Shiquan, one of the four famous families. The storytelling is meticulous. He is meticulous in every detail. He is allowed to "tang face book" and is best at winning the competition. He is now affiliated with the Huiquanlou daily head block, speaking for an hour, a master of planing wheels, extraordinary, but unfortunately not noticed by those who are new to storytelling.

"Singer Red Peony" was a masterpiece of Butterfly Hu, who was very popular at the time. Now, at her own suggestion, it is being re-shot as a sound film, directed by Wang Cilong, and starring Wang Wenlong, Wu Chufan, Wang Naidong, and others. Starting tomorrow, it will be screened at the Great Shanghai Theater after "New Sisters".

### A Quick Sketch of Chen Yunshang Going to Hong Kong

— Ciping

Miss Chen Yunshang, a Chinese film star, after completing the giant films "Home" and "New Sisters" in the National League, originally planned to shoot another film adapted from a mixed-race daughter, "Private Love", but due to the repeated calls from the Hong Kong Daguan Company, she could no longer delay, so Miss Yunshang asked for a two-month vacation to go to Hong Kong to fulfill her previous filming contract, which was still two years ago. Miss Chen signed a contract with them to shoot a play, the title of which is a fashion film "Female　Binhan"

Yesterday afternoon at two o'clock, the Jianghaiguan Wharf on Guanglu Road, Sanmalu Bund was crowded with people. The senders seemed to be more lively than usual. It turned out that most of them were unfamiliar senders. Young men and women were all expecting the same thing.

Chapter 18　Swearing to Sweep Away the Xiongnu Regardless of One's Own Body

Li Zicheng said: "Hmph! Don't blame you, who should I blame?" Wu Xiang said: "Your lowly subject dares not say." Li Zicheng said: "Strange, strange! Why don't you dare to say it? Just say it." Wu Xiang said: "Your lowly subject understands that my son loves his favorite concubine Yuanyuan the most in his life. The other day, he left Beijing in a hurry and didn't bring her with him. Now that Yuanyuan belongs to our King, it's like taking away the flesh of his heart, so he wants to change his mind." Li Zicheng sneered and said: "So this is all my fault." Wu Xiang said: "Your lowly subject dares not blame Your Majesty; but your lowly subject presumptuously has" a request. If Your Majesty can allow it, your lowly subject will be fortunate, and my son will be fortunate." Li Zicheng said: "Tell me about it." Wu Xiang said: "If Your Majesty wants to win the world, you must treat the generals with special kindness. If Your Majesty is willing to grant Yuanyuan to my son, then as long as your lowly subject sends another letter, my son will surely come back obediently and serve Your Majesty's command. Li Zicheng heard Wu Xiang's words and shouted, "Bah!" A mouthful of saliva spat directly on Wu Xiang's face. At this time, Wu Xiang was so frightened that he didn't dare to reach out to wipe it, showing the style of waiting for the saliva to dry on his face, trembling endlessly. Li Zicheng said loudly again: "Chen Yuanyuan is a peerless beauty, and now she belongs to me. In the future, I will wait for the day when I claim the title of emperor to be crowned as queen. How can your son have this blessing, dreaming of getting her as a wife! He can't get close to her in his whole life. You old thief! Don't use flowery words in front of me, cut him down." Just as he was about to order his men to push him out, Wu Xiang repeatedly kowtowed and begged for mercy. Just then, the rebel general Li Yan came to see him. Li Yan saw Wu Xiang's state of wagging his tail and begging for mercy, so he interceded for him and said: "Now Your Majesty should temporarily spare his life, and then punish him together when you capture San Gui in the future." Li Zicheng said: "Alright," so he ordered his men to detain Wu Xiang strictly and not let him go. So the men pulled Wu Xiang away.
