### Major Victory for British Forces in East Africa: Keren and Harar Fall Yesterday, Three-Quarters of African Colonies Now Taken, Looming Signs of the Total Collapse of the Italian Empire

London, official circles announced late yesterday that the British Empire forces had achieved two major victories in Africa: the first was the capture of Keren, a mountain fortress on the Agordat-Massawa line, which had been besieged for seven weeks. Its fall undoubtedly seals the fate of Italian Eritrea. The second victory was the capture of Harar, the second largest city in Abyssinia, the eastern gateway to the capital. British forces advanced swiftly on two fronts, one attacking Italian bases in Eritrea, the other advancing into the heart of Abyssinia at lightning speed. Fierce fighting had taken place at the Marda Pass guarding Harar just days ago, but now Harar is in British hands, and British forces are advancing on the capital from all directions. Once the capital falls, Italian power in East Africa will be wiped out. Keren is about 75 miles west of Asmara (the Eritrean capital), with a railway connecting to the Red Sea port of Massawa. Harar is about 280 miles east of the capital, with a population of 25,000. With the fall of Keren, three-quarters of Mussolini's oldest colonies are now in British hands. In the entire campaign to capture Italian East Africa, the strongest obstacle the British encountered was the fortress of Keren, the main shield for the important town of Asmara. The Italians wanted to resist the fierce British attacks in Africa for as long as possible, so they had to defend this important position to the death. Keren is situated on a mountain ridge thousands of feet high, with steep cliffs, a dangerous terrain, and natural defenses. Military experts acknowledge it as the most solid natural fortress, with heavy weapons protecting each peak and a dense network of machine-gun nests making it extremely strong. However, after weeks of preparation, the British forces finally conquered this formidable obstacle in one fell swoop. (Reuter, 28th) (Detailed map on page 6 of this newspaper, 28th)

London, Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that the fall of Keren effectively marks the end of the fighting in Italian Eritrea. The Italian army may not put up strong resistance in Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, and Massawa, the key port, because the Italian Governor Aosta concentrated all his forces to defend the capital and Keren. Therefore, Asmara and Massawa may fall within days after being attacked by British forces. The Italian army fought hard at Keren, suffering heavy casualties, but ultimately could not withstand the fierce British attacks. The British capture of Harar is also important, as it threatens the main line of communication between the capital and coastal Djibouti. However, the British army does not need to rush to occupy the entire territory of Abyssinia, as most of this task can be entrusted to the patriotic Abyssinian army, it is said. An official communiqué stated that British Indian troops, with the assistance of the British Air Force, defeated the numerically superior enemy and occupied Keren after two weeks of fierce fighting under difficult conditions. A communiqué from the British Air Force stated that in the past twelve days, the British and South African Air Forces dropped 120 tons of bombs on Keren. The British aircraft provided great assistance to the British army besieging Keren by continuously circling over Italian positions from morning to night and fiercely bombing the area with 40 tons of bombs in the previous four days. South African fighters were also active in the area. A few hours before the fall of Keren on Wednesday, two South African planes shot down two Italian fighters. (Reuter, 28th)

British Commander's Divine Military Strategy

London, Reuters military correspondent reports that Italian East Africa is now under the control of General Wavell (Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in the Middle East). With the fall of Keren, Wavell can now move his troops to fight another enemy. The ferocity of the Italian fighting at Keren was unprecedented in Italian history, but they were defeated due to General Wavell's divine military strategy. Currently, the British army occupies Sidi Barrani on the Egyptian-Libyan border. General Wavell transferred two detachments of troops from the British army that captured that area, one entirely of Indian troops, to south of Sudan, with the mission of attacking Keren from Kassala on the Eritrean border. The two places are more than a thousand miles apart, across a desert. Few commanders dared to lead troops to attack from that direction, but General Wavell's strategy has now succeeded. If necessary, he can transfer most of his troops to fight elsewhere. (Reuter, 28th)

Blackshirt Warriors' Reputation Swept Away

Cairo, British military officials here claimed last night that an estimated 60,000 to 70,000 Italian troops defended Keren and Harar, accounting for one-third of the Italian army in Italian East Africa. Now that they have been defeated, it may lead to the total collapse of the remaining Italian forces in East Africa under Abyssinian Governor Aosta. The fall of Keren is a major blow to the morale and prestige of the Italian army. Now that Abyssinia is also under new threat from the Sudan, Aosta will find it even more difficult to cope. The Belgian army and the Sudanese border guards from the Sudanese side have occupied Gambella, an important trading post near the border. If the Italian army reinforces that area, its 150-mile-long line of communication with the capital will be in danger. Furthermore, the Italian troops in other threatened areas are already fighting defensively, trying to hold on to their positions. It is doubtful whether they can spare troops to reinforce. At the beginning of the war, it was estimated that Aosta led a total of 220,000 Italian troops, 10,000 of whom were wiped out in the Somaliland campaign. Although there are important mountain peaks between Keren and the capital that can be used for defense, the Italian army may not stubbornly resist. Cairo currently expects the Italian army to suffer repeated defeats and will not be able to hold out until the rainy season. (Reuter, 28th)

British and Indian Allied Forces Are Invincible

London, dispatch from Reuters special correspondent at the Keren front: After careful preparation, the British Highland Army and the Indian Army launched a fierce attack on Keren and finally captured it. The British forces began advancing along the roads on both sides of the Keren Valley at 4:30 pm on Tuesday, one advancing along the railway line and the other advancing along the opposite hillside, both exceeding the original plan and progressing very quickly. The British forces on the right quickly crossed the Keren Avenue and attacked a certain place. When the army stipulated the time of the attack, the Italian army began to counterattack the Dologorodoc fort. A team of Indian troops quickly advanced to a new position and, after fierce fighting, annihilated the counterattacking Italian army. One of our colonels was killed in action, and one major was captured. The Indian team then defeated a large Italian force, capturing many enemies. At the same time, the British forces advancing along the railway line suddenly attacked the headquarters of an Italian colonel. The colonel and two other officers were captured. The link between the Italian troops at the Sanchil peaks controlling the highway and the railway was also cut off by the British forces. The Italian army launched four counterattacks against the new positions occupied by the British army, but they were all repulsed and suffered heavy losses. On Thursday morning, the British artillery shelled fiercely for an hour. At 7 am, the British armored units rushed into Keren. The Italian army began to retreat after its resistance completely collapsed. The British army immediately sent two teams into the city, one advancing rapidly along the highway to Asmara, until it was temporarily stopped by Italian tanks and vehicles abandoned on the road. The other team of British troops advanced rapidly along the Magalei Valley in the northwest, surrounding the Italian troops resisting on the left side of the British army. It is estimated that at least 1,500 enemies were captured. The remnants of the Italian army retreating towards Asmara were repeatedly attacked by British artillery and aircraft, and the British infantry occupying the surrounding heights also strafed them fiercely. In the two days and nights before the fall of Keren, the Italian army launched twelve counterattacks, all of which failed. The number of casualties could not be estimated, but it is known that the Italian army has suffered thousands of casualties. The enemy army is in chaos and is unlikely to hold Asmara. A large number of Italian families are retreating to Asmara, so the Italian side may declare the area a non-defended city. (Reuter, 28th)

Italian Army's Escape Route to the Sea Cut Off

London, the British army has captured Keren, which means that the entire Italian Eritrea has no defenses. The two routes of the British army, advancing from the west and from the northern coastal plain, to capture Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, have been opened up. At present, the Italian army's route from Abyssinia to the sea has been cut off, with only the railway through French Djibouti remaining. (United Press, 28th)

### The Pope Appeals for Peace

Vatican City, Pope Pius XII delivered a speech this morning, reiterating his appeal for peace. Well-informed sources believe that the Holy See will ask the world to end the bloody tragedy. The Pope asked, "Why must the restoration of peace still be achieved through bloodshed, when those of intellect and goodwill can restrain their emotions and treat others with forgiveness? Justice and equality alone are sufficient to rebuild peace and tranquility, allowing all nations to coexist on this earth. The Pope will always persevere, pray diligently, and do everything possible to promote the early realization of peace." (International, 28th)

(United Press International, 28th)

Signing Ceremony

London, the US-British agreement to lease Atlantic bases to the United States was signed yesterday afternoon in an atmosphere of happiness in the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street.

The names of the recipients were engraved on the pens. The full text of the agreement was released yesterday. An official statement also stated that the quick signing of this agreement after the passage of the lease act demonstrates the development of the good neighborly and cooperative policies adopted by the two democratic countries, Britain and the United States, for their common interests, and has now entered a new stage. The interests of Britain are no less than those of the United States, and the interests of the colonies where the bases are located, as well as Canada and Newfoundland, will be explained by this agreement. According to this agreement, Britain should give the United States the fullest possible convenience in the face of potential danger, so as to protect its security and prevent unlimited dangers in the future. The leasing of these bases is a very real contribution by the territories concerned to the Allied cause of resisting tyranny and foreign lifestyles. (Reuter, 28th)

Editorial

### A Warning to Speculators

Since rice and grain have been controlled by speculators, black market prices have surged, rising repeatedly without end, and coal briquettes have followed suit. Currently, the price of imported rice has reached over 110 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), and coal briquettes have reached 12 yuan per dan (unit of weight). Other items, such as boiled water, have increased from one fen (currency unit) to two fen per ladle, and cut noodles have gradually risen from just over 3 jiao (currency unit) to 6 jiao per jin (unit of weight). For these items, there are still so-called "fair-price coal" and "cheap flour" available for supply to regulate the market, but how much can be provided cheaply, and are they available to the general public? In addition, other goods have risen in response to the trend, increasing by 20-30% or more. Looking back to the spring of last year, prices also soared, led by the price of rice, followed by price increases of all other goods. This year, it is happening again. And those in the trade often blame it on speculators, saying it is the work of hoarders. This statement is not false, but those who trade with speculators and those who help speculators sell their goods are all intermediaries in the trade. Speculators are undoubtedly guilty, but can those in the trade be excused? They mutually benefit from each other, repeatedly exploiting the situation, and increasing profits, whereas before they would make a 10% profit, now they won't sell without a 40-50% profit, and thus a great profit is in hand.

Seeking profit is the desire of most people, and we don't need to criticize it deeply. What we pray for is: first, that most people can each obtain their due profit; second, that those who profit do so without harming others and can enjoy their profits. But this is not the case now. Not only are the beneficiaries only a very small number of people in society, not only does this small number of people harm the majority, but even this small number of people who profit may not be able to enjoy their profits in the end. According to the truest principle, profit and harm are like shadows, and there is no such thing as all profit without any harm. In the Jin Dynasty, there was a man named Shi Chong who was arrested and taken to the East Market. He lamented, "These slaves covet my family's wealth." The arresting officer replied, "Knowing that wealth leads to harm, why didn't you distribute it earlier?" Chong could not answer. However, during his lifetime, Chong only knew to accumulate wealth and build magnificent houses. His music and instruments were the best of the time, and his cuisine was the most exquisite of land and sea. How could he have known that there would be a day when he would die, his family would be destroyed, and his wealth would be lost? This is because too much wealth is most likely to invite disaster, especially in chaotic times. Although this saying seems trite, it remains unchanged throughout history. Even in today's economic theory, the so-called profit must return both principal and interest to be a real benefit. If you have goods in hand and the price soars, it is still like a flower in a mirror or the moon in the water. Even if it is as all speculators hope, in the near future, prices will only rise and not fall, so there is little need to worry about losses; but they do not consider that consumers' consumption, whether it is rice, cloth, oil, salt, or vegetables, although it is said that they cannot be lacking for a day, due to high prices and low purchasing power, people sigh in despair and stop buying. If so, then where is the profit for speculators? This is one reason. The public's livelihood is unsustainable, and starving people will rise up to cause trouble, and public order is in danger. Then there is no choice but to take emergency measures, requisitioning daily necessities for public use, selling them at fair prices, and stabilizing people's livelihood. Although this has not been implemented today, if speculators continue to do evil, prices continue to rise, and the situation continues to be chaotic, then who knows if there will be such a day? This is the second reason. The reason why there is so much hoarding now is because, first, there is no end to the price increases; second, all goods are rising, but the interest on bank deposits is decreasing. Therefore, those with more financial capacity would rather pool their resources. Those with little wealth hoard a little, and those with great financial capacity hoard a lot, so there is hoarding of everything, and there is an increase in prices for everything. There are even those who use low-interest deposits to make huge stockpiles, that is, using the public's resources to harm the public. Such a method can only be done once, and it cannot last long. As time goes on, it will inevitably be rejected by reason, and then people will urgently seek to sell off their goods, and prices will plummet. Where is the benefit for the general speculators? This is the third reason. Speculators mostly use the resources of the financial industry and warehouses. Once the financial industry discriminates against loans for hoarding and reduces them, and stays outside the scope of speculation itself, it can be predicted that although prices may not return to their old levels for various reasons, it will be difficult to maintain today's high prices. This is the fourth reason. The greedy ignore the so-called legal sanctions, truly because the law is sometimes powerless; they ignore the so-called social sanctions, truly because society is like loose sand and seems to have no power; but social sanctions are slow in coming, and when they are launched one day, they will have an irresistible and tremendous power. It is expected that in the future, there will be more and more people who make ill-gotten gains from hoarding, leading to them being unable to stand in Shanghai. This is also the so-called social sanction; they will leave in tears, so what is the benefit of wealth? This is the fifth reason. Or, without hoarding, the stockpiles of all supplies in Shanghai would not be so abundant. How can you know that the panic wouldn't be even worse than today? The meaning of this is that they rely on this hoarding. The so-called abundance does not refer to the abundance of goods stored in warehouses. Goods stored in warehouses are indeed valuable, but there is still a shortage of circulation in the market, and market prices are still soaring. From the consumer's point of view, abundance and non-abundance are the same. Trading to seek legitimate profits is the business of merchants; hoarding to enrich oneself at the expense of society is the crime of unscrupulous merchants. The two are very different and cannot be combined into one to excuse unscrupulous merchants. Now, the sources of various goods have not been cut off, but speculators, with their strong financial resources, not only hold on to what they have accumulated and refuse to sell it, but also sweep up what is newly arrived and store it in warehouses, not to be sold on the market; if it is said that they will ultimately not be subject to sanctions, those who understand reason will not believe it. The greedy take advantage of the dark days, but they should know that the days of darkness will soon see the light of day. Even in the darkness, is the protection of wealth guaranteed? Thinking of this, shouldn't they realize the truth?

### Japanese Troops Retreat in Two Directions in Northern Jiangxi; Chinese Army Fiercely Attacks Main Japanese Force; Remnants near Gao'an Cleared Out; Japanese Encircled North of Jin River

Chongqing Yesterday afternoon, a military spokesperson told reporters that in the Jiangxi province battles, the Japanese suffered 20,000 casualties. After the Chinese army repelled Japanese troops in the north and south, it fiercely attacked the main Japanese force near Gao'an. As a result, the Japanese backbone, composed of a division, retreated in defeat in two groups, one by boat and one by land, in disarray. The Chinese army sank over fifty ships full of Japanese soldiers. Gao'an was recaptured two days ago, and all remaining Japanese were cleared out by the Chinese army. Japanese troops retreating by land along the north bank of the Jin River have been encircled near Nancha. The Japanese are running out of food, which is currently being supplied by Japanese aircraft. Two days ago, the Chinese shot down a Japanese plane. It is expected that all Japanese troops here will be completely eliminated within one or two days. (28th Reuters Dispatch)

Chongqing During a weekly briefing for foreign reporters, a Chinese military spokesperson confirmed that the Chinese army had occupied Gao'an and that the Japanese suffered losses nearly as severe as in the previous Battle of Taierzhuang. Since the flanks of the Japanese troops in Gao'an had been routed by the Chinese army, the division-sized central force was caught in a salient and attacked from both sides. In total, the Japanese used three divisions in this battle. The Japanese troops in the Nancha area are still resisting stubbornly but are surrounded, relying solely on Japanese aircraft to supply food and provisions. Yesterday, the Chinese army shot down a Japanese plane full of supplies. The Chinese spokesperson denied Japanese claims of occupying Shanggao, stating that there was no change on the Jiangsu-Zhejiang front, where the Japanese advances failed, resulting in three to four thousand casualties and showing signs of collapse. The Chinese army in Guangdong has captured Pingshanwei. There have been no significant developments in North China. It has been observed that the Japanese have intensified their blockade along the coast for the past month, apparently attempting to cut off Chinese overseas supplies and defeat the main Chinese force to eliminate worries for their southward advance. In reality, even if the Japanese gain some small victories along the coast, the defeats in northern Jiangxi, southern Shanxi, western Anhui, and west of Yichang have come at a significant cost. (27th Havas Dispatch)

Currently, the Chinese and Japanese armies are facing each other between Chongyang Nansha Ping Tiezhu Port. A reporter who recently inspected Tongcheng City saw that the original eight hundred-plus market houses and over twenty thousand residents had been reduced to ruins and scorched earth, with rubble piled high and no trace of human habitation. Tongcheng is now building a new Tongcheng on the ruins. Vice Commander Yang, representing Generalissimo Chiang and Commander Xue, entered the city to comfort and provide disaster relief, greatly moving those left behind after the occupation. When the Japanese army retreated in defeat, the fortifications at the outer strongholds of Xishan, Jingshan, and Guming Mountain were not destroyed, and the Lushi Bridge at the North Gate was not burned. The Japanese built roads connecting the various strongholds and their cores on civilian farmland. The Chinese army has allowed the people to destroy the roads for spring plowing. The Chinese army has also allowed the people to freely take away the large amounts of oil jars, canned goods, and food abandoned by the Japanese in the city. (27th Dispatch)

Unexpectedly, more than fifty boats were all sunk by China, and countless officers, soldiers, and weapons were lost. Those who escaped by land were also subjected to Chinese interception, causing heavy casualties. The Chinese then rushed straight to Gao'an City and captured it in one fell swoop. Those who broke through to Nan Cha on the north bank of the Jinjiang River have been heavily surrounded by the Chinese and are running out of ammunition and food. On the northern front, since China recovered Cunqian Street on the 19th, the remnant Japanese troops have retreated to Hualinzhai Luofang Street. In the Battle of Luofang on the 22nd, more than 4,000 Japanese troops were killed. The Japanese army has now retreated eastward along the Liao River, and China is chasing after them. On the southern front, the Japanese troops who attacked Duchen from Qujiang were defeated by China on the morning of the 22nd. China recovered Duchen and pursued north of Duchen. Currently, the Japanese army on the south bank of the Jinjiang River has been largely cleared out. In this battle, a total of more than 20,000 Japanese troops were killed or wounded, opening up an unprecedented victory.

The Battle of Jiangsu and Zhejiang The Japanese troops on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang began to flee on the 26th.

The Japanese then did not dare to advance again and crossed the river on the front and retreated in one blow. China completely recovered Pingshan Market at noon on the 20th and divided into two routes: Pingbai Pingfu. (2) On the 24th, more than two thousand Japanese infantry and cavalry, under the cover of Japanese aircraft, rode motorboats from the Datou waterway to attack Chaoyang. At the same time, another group of Japanese landed in Shanwei and attacked Haifeng. The purpose is still nothing more than a blockade. (28th Dispatch)

### Regarding the Chinese Communist Question: George Bernard Shaw Issues Statement; China Should Consolidate Unity; Any Division is a Mistake

London The famous literary figure George Bernard Shaw recently made a statement to the Central News Agency regarding the Chinese Communist question, stating that although his own position is biased towards the Communist Party, he absolutely agrees with Generalissimo Chiang's advice to the CCP. The central government may be misled by the precedent of Brest-Litovsk (referring to the place where the Soviet Bolshevik government and Germany made a separate peace in the First World War). However, they must recognize that the current situation is significantly different from that at the time. President Roosevelt recently supported Chiang Kai-shek's need for assistance. We must ensure that he achieves his goal. In fact, the United States is fighting Japan side-by-side with China. Under these circumstances, for China to consolidate its unity, it will definitely achieve victory. Therefore, any military division made by any party before this goal is achieved is a mistake and will be cursed by future generations. (28th Dispatch)

Dr. Baker was appointed by the Chinese government as the head of a special committee to improve the Burma Road and accelerate its transportation. (28th United Press Dispatch)

### Hong Kong Refugees Gather; Public Health a Concern; Fears of Epidemics This Summer; Authorities Greatly Concerned

Hong Kong In Hong Kong's residential areas, there are few houses and many people. It is common for five people to sleep in one bed, but they do not complain and even welcome the arrival of the hot summer, which is because of the ongoing war in China. However, health authorities are quite worried about this situation because of the high mortality rate from lung disease and the spreading trend of the tiger epidemic. The situation will be even more dangerous with the arrival of the rainy season. The reason why Hong Kong is overcrowded is that refugees from all parts of China have gathered here, especially from Guangdong. Refugees from Shanghai are mostly wealthy, and they do not want to return to Shanghai for political reasons. Hong Kong currently has a population of 1.6 million, twice as many as usual. It is generally believed that this number is too large, and if anything unexpected happens, it will make it difficult for the defense authorities to defend. European and American women and children, and some wealthy Chinese, have previously gone to Manila or Honolulu, while the rest remain here to overcome all difficulties. When asked why they don't leave, the general Chinese response is "There is nowhere to go." The Chinese in Hong Kong do not all believe that they are in a safe area. Those who are well-off, whether they were born locally or came from the mainland, often ask foreign news agencies if Hong Kong is in danger. The current situation in the European war is not as reported in the newspapers, which is why they are fearful. The reason for their fear is that they only receive one-sided news here, and the local newspapers are sometimes subject to news censorship, often leaving blank spaces. In fact, the news from all international news agencies, including the International News Service, is not censored upon arrival, and British newspapers are free to publish all the news from Britain and the United States. Even the news from Japanese news agencies is not prohibited. (28th International Dispatch)

### British Newspaper Analyzes the Far East Situation; Japan's Adventurous Southern Advance Inevitably Leads to Unfortunate Consequences

Hong Kong Hong Kong published an article by the famous London reporter Garvin analyzing the situation in the Far East. Garvin believes that the U.S.'s determination to resist aggression remains unchanged, and Japan's southern advance may therefore be halted. Garvin stated that Singapore has become an impregnable fortress, and Hong Kong is also determined to defend the area at all costs. From now on, we will not easily give up an inch of land due to Japanese pressure. Japan's ambitions are endless, and Japan's warmongers are now imitating Nazi tactics. Their adventure in China, now in its fourth year, has been unable to extricate itself and has achieved nothing. They still dream of conquering 400 million people, and it may never be possible to realize this dream in the long run. The United States has the determination to deal with all eventualities. If Japan rashly thinks of advancing south, it would be tantamount to suicide. (27th Dispatch)

### South Breaks from Axis Embrace, Receives Enthusiastic Support from Military and Civilians, Britain and America Willing to Provide Substantial Aid, German Diplomacy Suffers Unprecedented Failure

Nanking Capital, The new cabinet of South Korea has now been formed, with General Simović as Prime Minister. The three cabinet members who resigned previously in opposition to signing the treaty have all been reinstated. Croatian leader Maček is the First Deputy Prime Minister. Although he was a member of the previous cabinet and held pro-German views, he consistently opposed becoming a vassal of Germany. Ivanović is the Second Deputy Prime Minister, who previously appealed to the regents not to sign the Axis pact. The new cabinet is composed of representatives from Serbian, Croatian, and Slovenian parties. (Reuters, 28th)

Nanking Capital, Yesterday throughout South Korea, the public expressed joy and loyalty to the young king through demonstrations. Flags flew throughout the streets and alleys of the capital, and hundreds of thousands of people cheered for the king. Newspapers published special editions with large characters proclaiming the South Korean king's declaration. The public spontaneously marched, holding photographs of King Peter of South Korea. Everywhere, order was maintained. (Reuters, 28th)

London, Reuters military commentator stated that the South Korean military and civilians' support for the young king, opposition to Nazi rule, and cleansing of South Korean traitors will have a significant impact on the military situation. The Nazi army can no longer use South Korea as a base to attack Greece southward along the Vardar River valley. If the German army prepares to seize the route south by force, it will encounter South Korean resistance and war will break out, and the fighting will be fierce, and the German army will suffer significant losses. The people of South Korea are known for their bravery, and the terrain of South Korea is extremely difficult to advance on, but very suitable for defensive warfare. Now the Nazi general staff must deal with the situation of attacking Greece along the Struma River valley and the Mesta River valley, on a limited length of the front line, or deploying more troops to attack South Korea simultaneously. If so, the German forces will feel even more strained and may not succeed. Therefore, the earliest result of the new situation in South Korea may be that the German side will be delayed for at least several weeks before engaging in any activities in the Balkan Peninsula.

The Nazi side said, "South Korea will issue a clear statement before the weekend. It is not known whether we will be rejected in this statement." However, Germany firmly believes that South Korea will respect its obligations to the Axis powers, so it is waiting quietly for the development of the situation. The German side acknowledges that the situation is already very complex and cannot be judged hastily at this time. However, the Germans are prepared to protect their interests. The German side also said that they firmly believe that South Korea will not risk "serious consequences" by abandoning the Axis pact. (International News Agency, 28th)

### Young King Breaks Free from Pro-German Pact, Issues Edict to Accelerate Troop Mobilization

Cheerful crowds gathered in front of the British, Greek, and Soviet embassies, and anti-Axis slogans could be heard everywhere. The Greek Orthodox Archbishop of South Korea, Kafrylo, broadcast, "Yesterday's shame has been washed away. We must fight for freedom, even if we die unyielding, just like millions of other people in other countries." The new government has informed the people of the country that anyone who owns a car or motorcycle should immediately report to military personnel with their vehicles. Various military preparations are being accelerated in all directions. Thousands of letters and telegrams of loyalty to the royal family flooded into the palace. Former Regent Prince Paul has fled to Greece. Former Prime Minister Živković and former Foreign Minister Marković have both been arrested.

### British Prime Minister Says South Korea Has Found Its National Soul, Eden May Visit South Korea

London, British Prime Minister Churchill delivered an impromptu speech at the Conservative Party annual conference yesterday, stating that South Korea has "found its national soul" and that the new government may refuse to join the Axis pact. Churchill also said that Britain's recognition will be based on this refusal. "Britain will provide assistance to those who rise up to defend their common homeland when attacked, such as Turkey and Greece, to the best of its ability." (International News Agency, 28th)

London, Prime Minister Churchill declared yesterday that he believed Yugoslavia would abandon the Tripartite Pact and defend its borders. Churchill made the remarks at a banquet honoring the new US Ambassador to Britain, Winant, saying, "Although I do not know the details of what has happened, and no one can be certain about any event, I believe there is reason to expect the Yugoslav government to abandon the Tripartite Pact signed the day before yesterday (Tuesday) and to defend its borders from invasion." Prime Minister Churchill promised to provide Yugoslavia with all possible assistance and also promised to provide assistance to Turkey. He said, "If Turkey is invaded, we will do our best to provide assistance." Those present applauded for a long time to express their approval. Churchill, with a pale face and a smile, continued to declare that he was often reluctant to explain Britain's war aims, but he believed that if the democracies were victorious, there would be an electrical atmosphere in the world that would lead to greater social unity and more justice than had been achieved in decades of peacetime. "When we see the souls of the heroic Serbians and Yugoslavs being sold by their weak and cowardly rulers to those who previously oppressed them and will later strip them of their lives and independence, we all feel sad. If the new government of Yugoslavia abandons the Tripartite Pact, Britain will recognize the new government and will do everything in its power to help defend the nation's territory, just as we are currently helping Greece. If Turkey is attacked, we will also give it the same assistance. When all our factories have handed over their production and the big factories have also produced new weapons, we will be stronger than we are now, but we are still strengthening every day." Reaffirming that Britain would do its best to provide assistance, Churchill said he was sure that President Roosevelt would be similarly moved by this generous sentiment of those who fought for freedom, "and in accordance with American law and the Constitution, he would allow him, as a great democratic leader, to lead the country forward. I am sure he will send all his sympathy to the Serbians. Therefore, at this time, we have ample reason to hope that the war can achieve results. The final result may still be distant, but it may also be closer than we estimate. You cannot really know it." Churchill also said to Winant that after the banquet, he could clearly understand again that Britain was determined to advance in coordination with the great American democracy until a way out was opened. Churchill reiterated that Britain's strongest labor and capital organizations welcomed Winant, which was noteworthy. This may be due to the high tradition that American ambassadors often have, or due to the focus of the war we are involved in, and most importantly, it is due to Winant's special personality and his service to the united labor and industrial movement. Winant also spoke at the banquet, comparing democracy and dictatorship. He said that when the British government needed greater power in an emergency to serve the interests of the public, the free people automatically gave the government strength rather than the government taking it forcibly by dictatorial orders. Democratic countries are now combining forces to confront an enemy, an enemy of medieval punishment combined with modern machinery and technology. At the banquet, Churchill and Winant praised each other. (Associated Press, 28th)

Hungarian Capital, Unconfirmed reports here yesterday stated that as a result of the Yugoslav coup, British Foreign Secretary Eden may visit the Yugoslav capital. Officials are reserving criticism of the developments in Yugoslavia and maintaining a wait-and-see attitude. As for Eden's current whereabouts, nothing is known. (Associated Press, 28th)

President Roosevelt may, according to the Lend-Lease Act, provide effective material assistance for the sake of US national defense to countries that wish to maintain their independence and integrity against aggression. Welles also stated that South Korean assets in the United States, which were announced to be frozen this week, may now be released. (Reuters, 28th)

Washington, The talk here is about the South Korean coup, which is regarded as the most pleasant news since the British and Greek victory over the Italian army.

### South Korea Still Willing to Maintain Trilateral Friendly Relations with Germany and Italy

Nanking Capital, The new South Korean government notified the German and Italian ambassadors yesterday morning that South Korea is eager to maintain friendly relations with Germany and Italy. (Associated Press, 28th)

According to a German news agency report, qualified sources in Berlin warned that as of yesterday afternoon, they had not received "reliable information about the South Korean incident." Therefore, official and semi-official circles in Berlin are not expressing any attitude towards this matter. Furthermore, Radio Rome broadcast that Italian officials also had no opinion on the events in the South Korean capital. Italian officials received a telephone report from the Italian Embassy in the South Korean capital. (Reuters, 28th)

Swiss Capital "Swiss News Agency just released a Roman message stating that after the coup in Yugoslavia and the young King Peter II personally assumed power, Italian political figures have not yet shown any reaction and want to wait for news in order to understand the truth of the coup in South Korea. Although the newspapers unanimously published the speech to the people issued by Peter II, they did not comment on it. Only the 'Italian Daily' published an article, which stated that 'After the South Korean Cvetković cabinet decided to join the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact, Britain did not hesitate to use one of the most powerful cards to cause major difficulties in the political situation in South Korea after joining the alliance. This is very obvious.'" (Havas, 27th)

### Rumor That German Mechanized Units Have Moved from Romania to the South Korean Border

South Korea, South Korea rushed to send 1,200,000 troops to key points on the border, so the military launching period in the Balkans this morning is imminent. It is reported that this move by South Korea is the new government's response to Germany's recent spy document. News said that at the same time, the German mechanized units in Romania and Bulgaria are now moving to positions near the eastern border of South Korea. Last night, the pro-government Simović cabinet held an emergency cabinet meeting for two hours to discuss South Korea's "yes or no" response to Germany's request to participate in the Tripartite Pact. It is reported that the deadline set in the German spy document will expire this morning. It is reported that the British Ambassador to South Korea, Campbell, and the US Ambassador to South Korea, Lane, have assured King Peter and Prime Minister Simović that if war occurs, Britain and the United States will provide material assistance to South Korea. General Simović appealed to the public at midnight, saying, "Demonstrations are very dangerous, as they may damage friendly relations with neighboring countries, so we must avoid them." The South Korean Prime Minister urged the public to return to normal. Demonstrators carrying British, American, Greek, and Soviet flags traveled through the streets all night, and large groups of people were madly cheering in front of the aforementioned embassies.

### Enduring Combat Strength: China Cannot Be Conquered by Force; London Times Discusses the Far Eastern Situation, Believing That Matsuoka's Diplomacy Will Hardly Succeed

LONDON - The "Times" today published a special article titled "Chiang Kai-shek's Resistance," speculating on the possible results of Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Moscow and the capitals of the Axis powers. It stated that Japan is now determined to obtain certain benefits from the Tripartite Pact. During Matsuoka's stay in Europe, he will make every effort to personally inspect whether Japan's future actions should involve advancing southward in Asia, coinciding with Hitler's spring offensive, or whether Japan should make China concede certain sacrifices to break away from the Axis.

Matsuoka's Trip to Europe: Much Speculation

China has engaged in much speculation regarding Matsuoka's trip. The general public believes that Matsuoka will first conclude a trade agreement with the Soviet Union, thereby using this as the first step in his diplomatic victory and as a stepping stone to concluding a more profound and comprehensive political agreement, namely a non-aggression pact. Regardless of the actual value of the non-aggression pact, its signing could allow Japan to transfer a large portion of the 300,000-strong Kwantung Army currently stationed in Manchuria for southward expansion. Matsuoka will press Moscow to cease supplying China with military supplies, undoubtedly using the recent friction between the Kuomintang and the Communists in China as material for slander. Tokyo desires, moreover, to see the New Fourth Army facilitate the split of Nationalist China. During Matsuoka's stay in Berlin, he will personally inspect the Axis powers' chances of victory, as the Lend-Lease Act has opened the door for a continuous flow of American military supplies into Britain, giving hope like last autumn. If Hua feels satisfied with this, then the date for Japan's southward adventure, coinciding with Hitler's long-planned offensive, will be agreed upon. Furthermore, because the Axis powers and Japan are far apart, this move will require technical cooperation to eliminate the significant obstacles that may arise and to prevent the United States from interfering in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Finally, an agreement will inevitably be made regarding how to distribute the spoils of war in Asia. If Matsuoka feels doubtful about the Axis powers' victory, then he will be unwilling to gamble the Japanese Empire on a single throw of the dice, risking repeating the mistake of Suvorov. Therefore, he may hint to London and Washington that Japan is prepared to withdraw from the Tripartite Pact without requiring any sacrifices from the Allies and the United States, but with certain sacrifices imposed on China. In short, Matsuoka is determined to use the Tripartite Pact, which only benefits one side of the Axis, as a bargaining chip, and will only make concessions if Japan receives equal benefits in return.

Japan's Southward Advance: Feint to the East, Attack in the West

The question that arises today is whether China will seize the opportunity to reconcile with Japan if Japan attacks Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. The answer is that Chongqing has firmly stated that it will not. In the eyes of the Chinese, Japan's southward advance is merely a feint to the east and an attack in the west. Japan's threat to China will not be eliminated in the slightest because of it. Japan's ultimate goal is to conquer China, which it can never forget. Tokyo intends to merge the two countries into a large economic bloc, which is strategically easier than defending islands stretching thousands of miles across the ocean, from Kamchatka in the north to Darwin in the south. China's millions of square miles of fertile land can supply Japan with the food and raw materials it needs, and its 450 million people can be exploited, exhausting their energy and sweat in Japanese industries. Conquering China would also provide Japanese goods with a vast and immensely profitable market. Therefore, the southward advance is merely an attempt to temporarily place China in cold storage, to be taken out again when the time is right. Furthermore, once Japan conquers Vietnam, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies, it can gain new strength upon completing the southward advance and re-attack the Chinese mainland. China will then be completely isolated. With Japan straddling Vietnam and Thailand, it can sit comfortably and cut off the transportation on the Burma Road, block the path of Australian reinforcements to Southeast Asia, and directly affect the Indian Ocean situation in relation to the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea. At that point, both China and Britain will find it difficult to move an inch. The Burma Road is now China's lifeline, allowing foreign supplies to enter the country and domestic products to be exported abroad, and Singapore is the fortress defending Burma. Another important economic point, little known, is that China's invisible exports will also be severely threatened.

Overseas Chinese Love Their Country and Enthusiastically Contribute

The number of overseas Chinese in Vietnam, Thailand, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines is estimated to be no less than eight million. The amount of capital they have invested in the revival and industrialization of free China is as high as 800 million yuan. The donations they have made to their motherland's disasters have enabled the government to use the funds originally designated for relief to purchase military supplies, accounting for more than a quarter of China's total military expenditure. If the Japanese occupy or control the aforementioned areas, these overseas Chinese will not be able to find a foothold and will be expelled en masse, and their property will be seized entirely. As a result, the continuous inflow of donations and foreign exchange into China will cease. Not only will economic factors be endangered, but spiritual factors will also be jeopardized. China is currently pursuing a policy of united resistance, regardless of the sacrifices involved, until the goal of victory is achieved. Its struggle is not only for its own survival but also to resist tyrannical rule and defend the rule of law. In his recent great speech, President Roosevelt stated that obedience can only be enforced by force, but loyalty is different; it comes from within. This inner feeling is based on clear facts and contains ancient concepts. Today, Britain, Greece, China, and the United States are all like this. He also said that China's ability to cope with facts and its derision of realism, which are often part of their philosophy, have now been joined by a new concept of military efficiency under Japanese pressure.

China's Great Army: Five Million Strong

The Chinese have a traditional saying that "good men do not become soldiers," so their army completely lacked modern training. However, today, a large army of five million men has been trained, and a portion of them have become well-trained guerrillas. They have also created an industry for manufacturing weapons and have General Chiang Kai-shek, an extraordinary military talent, as their commander-in-chief, as well as several other commanders with remarkable combat achievements. When Japan started the war, it claimed that the Imperial Army would go on a parade and return in three months (the war against China is still undeclared, referred to as an "accidental incident"). However, after fighting in China for more than three and a half years, it has achieved nothing. When Hankou fell, the military stage of Japan's conquest of China came to an end, and the stage of static and attrition warfare began. China, relying solely on its large population, has been a powerful weapon against Japan's most intense blitzkriegs. China's great human resources and its inexhaustible natural resources, after being utilized, have produced astonishing results. China's ancient history and culture have given its leaders and people courage, strength, and vision. The aid provided by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is gradually strengthening China's defenses. China can now calmly wait for victory to arrive. Its commander-in-chief has always held the view that Konoe's fantasy of defeating China into submission will never be realized. When the capital fell, China was isolated and helpless, and the situation was extremely precarious. However, German envoy Trautmann's persuasion of Chiang Kai-shek to negotiate peace with Japan ended in disappointment. Today, if Germany tries to mediate again, it will undoubtedly fail.

Japanese Fears Increase Daily

The Japanese people's anxieties about the future of the war can no longer be concealed. In January of this year, Konoe first admitted that peace was nowhere in sight. In March, General Tanaka told the Diet that there was no need to crush the Chongqing government by force; it was only necessary to engage in economic development in the occupied areas to disregard Chongqing. Japan now has as many as one million soldiers serving in China, and the number of dead and wounded is even greater. The army's supplies are mostly obtained locally. It is said that in 1940, 60 percent of its military grain was seized from the Chinese and paid with military scrip that could not be used for purchases, causing the people in the occupied areas to be in danger of starvation. Even with this convenience, the Japanese army still suffers greatly, because it controls the trade in the occupied areas and refuses to pay the economic value of "cooperation" to the occupied areas. Cotton exports from China to Japan have fallen by three-quarters, making it impossible to make up for war expenses. Because China has suffered from the war and because Japan deliberately destroys property in the coastal and central provinces, its losses are of course far greater than those of Japan. What is strange is that the "Nanjing government," which governs the richest provinces in China, still relies on the drug trade run by the Japanese army for its political expenses. When the Chinese army retreated into the interior, the cultural and industrial circles followed. Students who go to the interior are still attending classes as usual, and many administrators come from those schools that have been reformed in remote areas. As for students traveling thousands of miles to the interior, it is because they risk being killed if they are captured by Japanese soldiers. Seventy machine workers in Ningbo dragged machines weighing 200 tons by handcarts, trekking for months through the mountains of Chongqing, despite being bombed by Japanese planes from time to time, and finally reached their destination and put the machines into operation. The Chinese Industrial Cooperatives are organized by this strong workers' group. There are now 20,000 cooperatives of varying sizes. This patriotic spirit is a new phenomenon in China.

Japanese and German Conspiracies Will Never Succeed

China's vast territory and large population make complete military occupation impossible. It can free up millions of people to take up arms to defend the country and millions of people to generate wealth for the country. All of these are decisive factors in spirit, strategy, politics, and economics. China will not be intimidated or fall into the trap of a conspiracy for peace. General Chiang Kai-shek once said, "The revolutionary Chinese spirit cannot be overcome and does not know the meaning of the word 'defeat'." This clear truth has been revealed and is in everyone's mind. Nazi diplomats stationed in Chongqing have clearly stated that Germany has not recognized the "Nanjing government" because Hitler does not want to hand China over to Japan. Although this makes Japan very unhappy, Germany still does this because the Germans suggest that it is wiser to cut off a limb than to lose one's life. This conspiracy will not succeed. China will not be deceived into negotiating peace with Japan, allowing its enemy to fully attack in the South China Sea. Considering China's preparation to fulfill its full responsibility in this struggle, Matsuoka's plan to sacrifice China and withdraw from the Axis will not succeed. This is obvious.

### Philippine Army Conducts Defense Exercises; Air Force Strength Greatly Increased

MANILA - The Philippine Army was fully mobilized today for its first major exercise in two years, scheduled for ten days. Thirty U.S. Army officers are assisting in the exercise, while other American officers are scattered throughout the Philippine Islands to observe the strength of the trained Philippine reserve army. In the event of war in the Pacific, they will command the 150,000-strong Philippine army. 23,000 men are participating in this year's exercise, and will receive intensive instruction and training within the limits allowed by the short period. The U.S. Army has decided to train Filipinos in preparation for war. Ten bombers, originally destined for Thailand, but detained here by order of the State Department, have been received after five months of delay and debate, greatly increasing the air strength of the army in the Philippines. Currently, there are three pursuit planes, one reconnaissance plane, and one squadron of bombers. It is understood that a large number of heavy artillery pieces have recently arrived here, including 155mm and 105mm types. The larger ones are for heavy-duty missions, while the 105mm guns are used as light artillery and howitzers. Although the supplies shipped to the Philippine Islands have increased in recent months, Philippine officials still want to obtain ordnance and ammunition for the Philippine Army for national defense.

### Commemoration of Revolutionary Martyrs Today; City Education Association and Others Jointly Telegraph a Reprimand to Mao Zedong and Others; Schools Close and Fly Flags at Half-Mast to Mourn

(Dahua News Agency) Today is the Commemoration of Revolutionary Martyrs, also the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang. Public and private schools at all levels in the city will, in accordance with the academic calendar regulations, uniformly close for one day and fly flags at half-mast to mourn. In accordance with the environment, no ceremonies will be held, but it is determined to strictly abide by the President's instructions, work hard in national salvation education, and complete the great task of resistance and reconstruction. The Shanghai Municipal Education Association and the nine educational organizations, including the Secondary School Friendship Association, believe that since today is the anniversary of the revolutionary martyrs, recalling the deeds of the revolutionary martyrs and their fighting spirit makes them feel even more the need to unite and complete the task of resistance and reconstruction. However, Communist Party Senators Mao Zedong and others refused to attend the Senate meeting because their proposed so-called "solution" and "temporary solutions" were not achieved, which is sufficient to affect the psychology of national use and destroy the spirit of unity. Therefore, they jointly issued a regular reprimand. The Dahua News Agency reporter recorded the original text as follows:

Educational Organizations Telegraph Reprimand to Mao Zedong

To Senator Mao Zedong in Yan'an, and also to Chen Shaoyu, Qin Bangxian, Lin Zuhan, Wu Yuzhang, Dong Biwu, and Deng Yingchao: Upon reading the newspapers, we learned that you, sirs, proposed so-called "solutions" and "temporary solutions" because the government disbanded the New Fourth Army and detained its chief officers, and threatened not to attend the Senate meeting. The whole country was shocked upon hearing the news. It is widely believed that you, sirs, usually speak of unity and resistance and reconstruction, but everything you do is to disperse unity and destroy resistance and reconstruction. The guarantees you provided in the twenty-sixth year have long since destroyed your credibility, causing pain to those close to you and joy to your enemies. If you, sirs, can still prioritize national affairs, you must repent as soon as possible. But until today, we have not heard any expression from you. Do you truly intend to abandon yourselves and sever ties with the 450 million Chinese compatriots? Unifying military orders and rectifying military discipline are necessary conditions for establishing a nation and are related to the success or failure of resistance and reconstruction. The Soviet Union's reorganization of its army is a lesson not far away. How could you, sirs, not know this? The government disbanded the rebel army in order to rectify military discipline and to strive for victory. But you, sirs, disregarded the overall situation and used this as a threat. We truly do not know what your intentions are. Now, the people of the whole country are eagerly hoping that you, sirs, will rein in your horses before it is too late and not go down a path of no return. Our association, etc., also take this day of the Commemoration of Revolutionary Martyrs to give you, sirs, this final loyal advice. What to do and where to go is up to you, sirs, to choose. Shanghai Municipal Education Association, Secondary School Friendship Association, Secondary Education Research Association, Secondary School Discipline Research Association, City Sports Association, Art Education Research Association, Primary Education Research Association, Boy Scout Academic Research Association, and the Compulsory Education Advancement Association, etc. offer our respects.

### Grain: Imported Rice Premiums Still Rebounding; Small Filtered Rice Seen Again at a $4,000 Premium

Imported rice continues to arrive in droves every day, with stockpiles steadily increasing. Even after accounting for recent sales and re-exports, warehouse inventories have still increased by 40,000 to 50,000 bags. Therefore, the rise in rice prices is entirely due to speculative manipulation, caused by large players raising prices and blind buying following suit. Although there has been some outflow to various occupied areas and Japanese merchants are buying broken rice, the total amount is less than one-third of the new arrivals. Actual sales in the city are only half, while warehouse additions and those not yet on the market account for one-third. However, rumors continue to circulate in the rice market, claiming that two ships carrying rice from Hong Kong were intercepted by an unspecified party, and that a large batch of February futures sold by Jian Yuan Foreign Firm will not be settled upon expiry. This has led to competition between actual sales and speculative trading. Large players are taking advantage of the opportunity to hoard and create artificial scarcity, causing premiums in the gray market to soar, often by $200 to $300 at a time. The premium for white-bodied small filtered rice opened at $4,000, then $3,900, reaching $4,100 to $4,200 in the mid-market. The premium for Zhongguan rose from $1,700 to $3,900. No. 1 Saigon was at $3,400, rising to $3,600; No. 2 Saigon rose from $3,500 to $3,800. Subsequently, actual sales slowed, and speculators rushed to sell, causing the market to stabilize. Then, large players also emerged, leading to an oversupply and a drop in premiums of $100 to $200. As a result, the premium for white-bodied small filtered rice was $4,000, Zhongguan was $3,800, No. 1 Saigon from Siam was $3,500, then $3,200 to $3,300, No. 2 Saigon was $3,500 to $3,600, fire-filtered rice was $3,500, and Tokyo polished rice was $3,600 to $3,700, while broken polished rice was $3,200. Compared to the morning market, the afternoon saw a sharp increase of $500 to $600, then $300, resulting in a steep rise of $4 per dan (a unit of weight), which was completely unexpected and due to the lack of regulation in the rice market.

Due to the surge in imported rice prices, domestic rice varieties such as thick and thin japonica rice saw a firming of sentiment among sellers, who uniformly raised prices. However, local stores showed little interest, so while prices rose, they could not match the pace of imported rice, increasing by only one or two dollars. Common varieties of special japonica rice, even with higher base prices, were unable to rise further, remaining stable at $124 or $122-123. Thin rice from Kunshan was offered at $120, then $112, while thin indica rice from Qingjiao was offered at $113, with no sales of original packages.

Glutinous rice also trended higher across the board, and its demand increased. Not only did retail stores adopt it, but large players also stepped in to absorb it, making holders optimistic and prices soar. As a result, it increased by about $3. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened high from $108, then $103, while glutinous green beans were at $97, then around $90 for broken ones.

Imported rice continues to arrive in abundance. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang vessel brought 12,863 bags from Hong Kong, arriving yesterday evening and docking at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. The Java Company's Chisarik vessel also brought a large shipment of imported rice, arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning and docking at the chimney pier in Pudong for unloading. The exact numbers will be confirmed and reported later. (Zu)

### Flour: Strong Arrivals and Sales

Yesterday's imported flour market continued to trend higher and firmer. In terms of supply, a large number of shipments have already arrived, such as the Golden Dragon brand of Canadian flour and the Steamboat Western Cow brand, totaling no less than 400,000 bags. Although arrivals are plentiful, they are being held by hoarders who are unwilling to sell cheaply. Given that the cost of new orders from abroad is above $31 per bag, while the market price is still above $30, speculative trading is very active, resulting in strong arrivals and sales. Australian flour (Clock Tower brand) rose to $30.03-0.04, and Golden Dragon brand also requires over $30. Amidst the rice price surge, the market is short of circulating capital, so market prices are unlikely to fall in the short term.

Yesterday's wheat market remained firm. Gao Du wheat was offered at over $50, but there were no transactions. Japanese factories were also receiving very little, with prices between $45 and $46, with daily receipts of only 100 to 200 bags.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Oil Falls and Rises Immediately

Yesterday's soybean oil market continued to be manipulated by speculators, with the market moving from small to large. Initially, many bears, influenced by the previous day's weakness, were eager to cut their losses, causing both futures and spot prices to fall by $1-2. However, due to the large bulls (cotton yarn dealers) holding firm and even adding to their positions, the defenses became stronger. In addition, those who were taking advantage of the situation pushed prices up, causing the market to reverse and exceed the previous day's prices. Spot oil rose by $1, while futures rose by about $3. Transactions included 200 dan of factory oil at $103, rising to $105; 120 barrels of Dalian oil at $140 to $142; 1,500 barrels for April delivery at $139.50, rising to $144.75; and 2,000 barrels for late April delivery at $1442 to $146.50. Peanut oil also turned from flat to firm, with prices rising by another $1-2. Transactions included 30 pieces of Yantai raw oil at $119, 400 cans of another oil at $159 to $160, and 500 cans of Jiangbei local workshop canned oil at $155.

Today, 3,000 bags of corn are being shipped to Yantai, 1,835 bags of soybeans to Xiamen, 507 bags of sorghum to Xiamen, 365 bags of sesame seeds to Hong Kong, and 600 bags of soybeans to Hong Kong.

### Finance: Black Market Exchange Rates Continue to Weaken

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC rates remain flat. Black market exchange rates for British and American currencies continued to weaken, due to the coup in the south and the possibility of cooperation between Japan and Germany following the meeting between Japanese Ambassador Matsuoka and Hitler. Speculators began to fear a potential conflict between Germany, the US, and Japan. China Bank and Bank of Communications continued to sell, while Japanese and foreign banks showed interest. Therefore, although the underlying trend was weak, it remained stable. The strongest trading for the day was 3 pence 165625 and 5 yuan 34375. However, at closing, the British pound was at 3 pence 125 and the US dollar remained at 5 yuan 34375. The results were up 0.03125 and 0.0625 compared to the previous day. The trend for April futures was similar.

Japanese Banks Aggressively Buy British Currency

In the early morning, London spot and forward rates fell 0.0625, while New York silver prices and London gold prices were flat. Exchange rates between the US and the UK, and between the US and Shanghai, remained unchanged, while the rate between the US and the UK was stable, and the rate between the US and Shanghai was up 6 points. Central Bank rates remained unchanged. Banks opened with spot selling rates of 3 pence 111875 for British currency and 5 yuan 28125 for British exchange, unchanged from the previous day. Speculators initially entered the market, and Hong Kong Electric followed suit, causing the market to strengthen. Transactions included 3-month forward US exchange at 5 yuan 34375 and spot British exchange at 3 pence 134375. HSBC rates remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax remained flat. Subsequently, Japanese banks aggressively bought spot British currency at 3 pence 25. At that time, US exchange for the current month at 5 yuan 34375 was difficult to settle. Later, with China Bank and Bank of Communications selling, the US exchange market finally firmed. At closing, the British pound was at 3 pence 25, and the US dollar was at 5 yuan 34375.

Hong Kong Electric Continues to Sell

The market opened slightly firmer for the US dollar and continued to be slightly firmer for the British pound. Spot and current month rates at 3 pence 265625 were available, due to Hong Kong Electric continuing to sell. Soon after, it was heard that HSBC sold spot US exchange to an American bank at 5 yuan 34375. Subsequently, speculators suddenly came in to cover their short positions in US exchange for the current month, making 5 yuan 34275 difficult to settle at one point. However, at closing, the British pound was at 3 pence 25, and the US dollar was at 5 yuan 34375. British currency for April was at 3 pence 234375, and US exchange was at 5 yuan 3125. The results were up 0.01225 and firmer by 0.0625 compared to the previous day.

Hong Kong Market Generally Unchanged

Hong Kong, 28th (Friday) - The exchange market opened steadily this morning, with no changes in British, American, and Japanese exchange rates. Shanghai exchange spot rates fell by 1.5 yuan to 462.5 yuan (yesterday's closing was 464 yuan). At 9:20 AM, Shanghai exchange spot rates continued to fall by 1 yuan to 461 yuan. At 11:30 AM, it was reported as flat, with all exchange rates generally unchanged.

Tianjin Exchange Market Reported Weakness

"Joint Notes" in the black market rose sharply by 3 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen to 64.5 yuan.

### Gold Market Bearish, More Selling Than Buying

Yesterday's gold market saw the open gold market continue to decline, falling several times past the 6,500 yuan level. Due to weak exchange rates, Shanghai West Side gangs continued to sell, and sentiment was generally softening. Securities firms (Yi Da Xiang Xing Yong) and HSBC merchants (Da Feng) were selling, and most retail investors were short, with more selling than buying. Therefore, after opening in the morning, it rose falsely to 6,552 yuan, then declined further, falling to 6,505 yuan in the afternoon. Unexpectedly, the US exchange rate stopped weakening and suddenly recovered, causing short sellers to rush to cover, and securities firms (Tong Kang Yong) and banks (Heng Ji) aggressively bought, pushing the price up by 40 yuan, but ultimately still fell by 39 yuan. After closing, rumors of a conflict between the US and Germany caused it to suddenly drop to 6,518 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was 230,000 taels. For carry trades (March rolling into April), sellers offered a discount but buyers still wanted 50 yuan. There were no cash transactions in the morning. In the afternoon, Yong Feng Yu sold 20 taels to Bei Qing Yun, 200 yuan higher than the futures price, approximately 70 yuan lower. Ornament gold, customs gold, etc., remained flat.

Open Gold Futures Continue to Fall

Since morning, exchange rates have been reporting firmness amidst speculative selling, making the market even more volatile. The market opened 30 yuan lower at 9:15 AM, at 6,545 yuan. Cheng Ji aggressively bought, and Heng Ji bought, pushing the price up to 6,558 yuan. It was then heard that US exchange for the current month at 5 yuan 3125 was available, triggering selling. Xiang Xing Yong Yi Da Xin Yuan Gong Da Ming Feng came to sell, causing the price to immediately fall by more than 30 yuan, to 6,525 yuan, which was absorbed by Cheng Ji Xiang He, causing it to rise again to 6,542 yuan. Exchange merchants Da Feng Yi Da De Cheng Heng Ji again aggressively sold, and with US exchange at 5 yuan 34375, China Bank sold, causing the price to fall again by more than 30 yuan, to 6,508 yuan. Chi Da Shun Yuan came to buy, pushing it up to 6,523 yuan. The morning closing was at 6,511 yuan. The afternoon market opened at 6,510 yuan, down 1 yuan. Next, it was seen at 6,508 yuan, which was bought by small money shops and banks, pushing it up to 6,522 yuan. Xiang Xing Yong Da Feng came to sell, pushing it back to 6,505 yuan. With exchange rates weakening, Heng Ji and Tong Kang Yong aggressively bought, and short sellers also came to cover, causing the price to suddenly rise by 40 yuan, reaching 6,545 yuan. Not long after, the market closed at 6,536 yuan, down 39 yuan from the previous day's closing price. Based on the closing price of US exchange for April at 5 yuan 3125, it was 6,555.3 yuan, a discount of 19.3 yuan. After closing, with rumors of a conflict between the US and Germany, Da Feng He Sheng Xin Yuan sold, pushing it to 6,518 yuan. The day saw a range of 53 yuan. The selling price of the cash market's own-brand gold was approximately 220 yuan higher than the open gold futures price. Buying was 80 yuan lower than selling. There is still no market for spot gold.

Ornament Gold Still Hanging at Old Prices

The selling price of jewelry gold in silver shops is still listed at 690 yuan per tael at Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, with a 40 yuan discount for buying back.

### Japanese Notes Plummet

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw open gold prices fluctuating downward. British and American gold pounds each fell by 2 yuan, while British gold notes remained stable, with market prices standing firm. American gold notes trended lower, retreating to 18 yuan 4 jiao 8 fen in the evening market, down 1 jiao 2 fen from the previous day. Hong Kong notes showed a firming trend, with market prices standing firm. The decline in Japanese gold notes and Korean notes became more intense, with the former already retreating to 2 yuan 02 fen, and the latter already falling to 1 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen.

### Securities: Bulls Driving Up Bonds

Yesterday's gray market for public bonds continued to trend firmer, with Types A and D unchanged. Types C and E, on the other hand, were mostly driven up strongly by bulls, continuing to be abnormally firm, although not officially rising or falling. Because market trading was relatively light, it was easily manipulated by certain elements at closing. Official price movements still depend on favorable or unfavorable environmental news. The current situation is brewing, and future changes are bound to be significant, and cannot be viewed with excessive optimism. Yesterday's trading saw Shun Chang exclusively buying Type E for several days, while Xin Fu, Xin Hua, and Tong Kang also had a small amount of buying. In the afternoon, Xie Xing Yuan, San Kai, Hong Da, and Xie Da all had buying interest, while Lian Yi, Heng Kang, and Jiu Fu had selling interest in both the morning and afternoon. Others, such as Da Tong, Xin Heng Yong, Dun Yu, Lian He, Tong Xing, and Hou Da, were consistently selling. Market prices were still driven up by bulls at closing. As a result, most rose by 1 jiao or 3 jiao, while Types A and D had varying highs and lows. The total transaction volume was still only 1.6 million to 1.7 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Stock Transactions: 10 shares of Bank of China were traded at a price of 94 yuan jiao.

Corporate stocks were relatively more active, with prices generally maintaining their previous closing levels. Yangzi Bank's shares hit a new high of 18.5 yuan before closing. Jardine Matheson opened at 107.5 yuan, with buyers at 108 yuan at closing. Rubber shares showed mixed gains and losses.

London, 27th (Thursday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks were generally sluggish, with no changes in prices.

### Yarn/Cotton: Yarn Market Difficult to Recover

Yesterday's yarn market continued to struggle to recover. Actual sales lacked bulk orders, and bulls were considering closing their positions, causing the market to decline. In addition, weakening exchange rates and falling gold prices significantly reduced the activity of large players, and the market lacked momentum. Selling pressure was quite strong. Fortunately, some short sellers covered their positions in the morning, and the first trade was at 1,394 yuan, reaching a high of 95 yuan. Subsequently, with no improvement in customer sales and scattered longs also closing positions, the market gradually fell to 1,384 yuan, the lowest price of the day. The market showed signs of oversupply. Subsequently, there was no lack of buyers taking advantage of the low prices, but they were also few in number, causing the market to return to 1,388 yuan at closing, down another 5 yuan from the previous day. There was approximately 10 yuan fluctuation throughout the day. Intra-industry speculation reached 4,760 bales. Miscellaneous brand yarn saw 168 bales imported from Hong Kong and 20 bales imported from the mainland, with prices also falling by 3 yuan. Shuang Ma Guang brand only imported 120 bales, with prices at 1,310 yuan, 70 yuan cheaper than factory prices. Today, 15 pieces of yarn are being shipped to Xiamen and 540 pieces to Hong Kong. The full-day sales of each trading group are listed on the left:

Hong Kong 240 Mainland 20

Industry 4,760 Total 5,020

### Cotton Market Quiet

Yesterday's spot cotton trading was quiet, with market prices generally stable. Factories did not purchase due to sluggish yarn sales, and there was little supply and demand among industry players, with only one transaction. Prices are listed on the left:

American Penjamo 19.0 Industry 200 pieces

Indian Rangoon Cotton 205.0 Industry 20 pieces

The New York cotton market, due to the rapidly changing situation in the European Balkans and favorable news for bulls from Washington, saw renewed optimism and an active market. As a result, closing prices were up 4-5 pound notes compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to European exporters selling, then recovered slightly due to support from large players. Finally, it fell again due to rumors that cotton shipments to China would be suspended. As a result, closing prices, except for Yamla, which rose 4 rupees, all fell by 2 rupees. It is predicted that today's opening will be flat, only looking at a 1 rupee increase.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was still satisfactory, with both factories and industry players making purchases in recent days, resulting in an active and firm market, with prices rising by 2-3 yuan. However, because most holders of goods are not in a hurry to sell, and factories are still not making large purchases, the total transaction volume is not large.

### Piece Goods: Varying Inventory Levels Lead to Differing Cloth Prices

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was peaceful, with a number of month-end maturing goods being resold. Industry players continued to take in goods, so the market remained firm. Customer sales continued sporadically. Prices varied depending on inventory levels, with white goods, coarse cloth, and light-weight cloth all increasing, with increases of 1 jiao to 5 jiao per bolt. There was a shortage of coarse twill, with Da Tong Flying Goose brand opening at 45 yuan, up 5 jiao. Fine cloth and fine twill prices remained unchanged, and dyed cloth prices also changed little. Transactions in the city totaled over 500 pieces of various cloths. The Zhejiang and Fujian trading groups handled coarse and fine cloth and blue cloth, while the Guangdong and Yunnan trading groups handled fine twill, coarse cloth, and Shilin cloth, totaling over 200 pieces. Today, 20 pieces of piece goods are being shipped to Xiamen and 950 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday's sugar market continued to rise as hoarders continued to absorb supplies, increasing by about 1 yuan. The association's clearing prices for spot goods saw No. 24 coarse white sugar at 87-88 yuan per this warehouse, up 1 yuan; 86.5 yuan and 87.5 yuan at other warehouses, up 1 yuan and 7 jiao, 7 yuan and 2 jiao, up 1 yuan to 7 jiao; end-of-March delivery at 86.8-87.8 yuan, up 1 yuan 1 jiao; April 10th delivery at 87.4-88.2 yuan, up 9 jiao; April 20th delivery initially at 88 yuan, 88.5 yuan, and 89 yuan, then softening slightly to 88.5-88 yuan, then rising again to 88.5 yuan, 88.8 yuan, up 8 jiao; Dutch red sugar at 68 yuan, up half a yuan; Taikoo brand white sugar B mark at 88 yuan to 88.8 yuan, 88.6 yuan, 88.5 yuan, and 88 jiao, with similar increases for lower grades; DY mark at 84.4 yuan, HX mark at 83.5 yuan, and crystal sugar at 114 yuan, also up 1 yuan. Yesterday, 1,100 bags of sugar were shipped from Hong Kong, and today 3,000 bags are being shipped to Qingdao.

### The Sweet Potato (Continued from the 28th)

— Gao Jiannong

What are the differences between sweet potatoes and foreign sweet potatoes? Xu Wendinggong explained it best: "There are two types of sweet potatoes: one is called 'shan yao,' which is native to Guangdong as illustrated in ancient texts; the other is called 'fan yao'… The stems and leaves of the two are similar, but shan yao climbs trees while fan yao spreads on the ground; shan yao is lumpy, while fan yao is round and long. As for the taste, fan yao is very sweet, while shan yao is inferior!" This distinction can be described as hair-splitting! The books cited earlier describe sweet potatoes as "like fists, like bones, like goose eggs, like chicken eggs," all of which are descriptions of their lumpy shape, which is very different from the "round and long" shape of foreign sweet potatoes. And the "red sweet potatoes" known to every household in northern China, some with yellow flesh and abundant juice, have a color and fragrance resembling honey; others with a white center and abundant starch, known as "chrysanthemum hearts" in the north, have a flavor that surpasses even the chestnuts of Liangxiang! Sweet potatoes with excessive water content and weak flavor cannot compare.

Although sweet potatoes and foreign sweet potatoes are indeed the same species, how did they have a falling out and separate to establish their own identities, each going their own way? This question, as Coutiere of France would say, is not a simple question of the "plant's" origin, but rather a question of the origin and distribution of the world's "humanity!" Because this plant not only has a long history on the continents of Asia and America, but its traces can also be found everywhere on the islands of the Pacific Ocean. In particular, the Maoris, the most culturally advanced people on New Zealand, believe based on ancient legends that sweet potatoes were born with them. Therefore, if it is said that the introduction of this plant was in Asia, then the people of the New World migrated from Asia; otherwise, the opposite conclusion would be drawn. Let us wait for the final verdict of the ethnologists!

Finally, we know that Xu Wendinggong, after first obtaining the seedlings of foreign sweet potatoes and recognizing their great benefits, based on the compassionate heart of a good prime minister who wanted to "eliminate hunger among the people," was willing to promote the planting, consumption, wine-making, and other uses of foreign sweet potatoes, as a means of promoting them widely, believing that "the ancients said: vines have six benefits, and persimmons have seven wonders," while foreign sweet potatoes far surpass them, having "thirteen advantages!" This visionary promotion of sweet potatoes is comparable to the efforts of Gerarde in England and Parmentier in France to spread potatoes, and can be placed alongside them as shining examples! Leaving aside Xu Wendinggong's contribution to first introducing Western science to China, just the act of spreading sweet potatoes alone is worthy of our gratitude and commemoration with a bronze statue! But if it weren't for bringing up old stories today, who would remember him as the great hero who advocated sweet potatoes? Only to see the portraits of Gerarde and Parmentier standing majestically overseas…

Editor's Note: The transplantation of sweet potatoes to the north, including the twists and turns, can be found in my History of Food and Political Affairs in China Through the Ages. I once read a note from a predecessor stating that plant names preceded by words such as "West," "Sea," or "Foreign" are mostly products of overseas migrants. I believe that his description is not detailed enough and cannot be fully trusted, but it cannot be said that there is no reason at all. I hereby append this note, but regret that the name of the book has been forgotten and cannot be found. (End)

### Public Works Department: Responsible for Chartering Ships, Transporting Rice from Rangoon to Shanghai, Approximately 20,000 Tons per Month; Establishes Subcommittee to Manage Purchase and Transport Matters

According to a public announcement by the Public Works Department, it was stated that during the regular board meeting held last Wednesday, the board of directors resolved to appoint directors Mitchell and Mindsdell to jointly study the food situation with the department's Food Subcommittee and relevant parties. A report has now been submitted, and the board of directors convened a special meeting on the afternoon of the 27th to carefully discuss the matter. They all agreed that the current issue is the transportation problem. There is no shortage of rice reserves in Shanghai at present, and the reason for the rice price increase is due to public concern about the source of supply. The Public Works Department does not wish to interfere with reliable business methods unless absolutely necessary. On the contrary, it is willing to support and strengthen them.

Clearing Shipping Lanes to Transport Rice to Shanghai

According to the two directors, based on the facts gathered, the root cause of the rice shortage panic and high prices is the lack of ships between Shanghai and Rangoon. As for transporting rice from Saigon to Shanghai, it is believed that there are sufficient ships available. However, shipping between Shanghai and Rangoon is currently not smooth due to the global situation. Therefore, the urgent task is for all relevant authorities to make every effort to clear the shipping lanes and transport rice to Shanghai.

Establishing a Committee to Handle Matters Specifically

As a result of the meeting's discussions, it was decided that the subcommittee, on behalf of the department, would find ways to charter ships to transport 15,000 to 20,000 tons of rice from Rangoon to Shanghai each month until the situation improves. The quantity to be purchased will be adjusted at any time depending on the local reserve situation. Regarding the chartering of ships, it is believed that it will be more successful if the committee handles it than if ordinary merchants do so.

Limited to Retail Sales in Shanghai

Once ships are chartered, it is planned to entrust them to reliable rice import merchants. The freight charges will only be sufficient to cover charter fees and incidental expenses. When placing orders, the committee will instruct the carriers to reserve the empty space on the ships solely for transporting cheaper rice. Furthermore, the contract with the rice merchants should specify that this rice can only be sold in Shanghai and is limited to retail sales to members of the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association for sale to households. If any violation of the above regulations is discovered, the committee may refuse their next order and publicly announce their names. This plan was decided after consultation with neighboring authorities, and it is hoped that the authorities can take similar measures to clear shipping lanes.

Striving to Establish Reasonable Prices

If Shanghai has a normal and sufficient supply of rice, there will be no need to manage rice prices. This should still be entrusted to normal rice businesses to establish reasonable prices. The department will seek the assistance of the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association to ensure that rice transported to Shanghai through chartered ships is only for retail sales.

Hoping Rice Merchants Will Still Supply Needs

It should be solemnly stated that the department does not intend to manage all rice imports and distribution. It only wants to manage the rice transported to Shanghai through chartered ships. It is hoped that normal rice businesses can continue to operate to meet the demand for high-priced goods in Shanghai and supply the needs of other cities.

Rice Reserves are Surprisingly Large

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee yesterday that the committee's current rice reserve survey (from last Thursday to this Thursday) was officially completed yesterday. The total number of rice bags in more than sixty Chinese and foreign rice warehouses throughout the city reached 841,275, an increase of 38,570 bags compared to the previous period. Among them, the first was Kung Ho Hsiang Shun Tai, totaling 166,679 bags, the second was Lung Mao, with 102,804 bags, the third was Taikoo, with 55,418 bags, the fourth was the Bank of China, with 54,843 bags, the fifth was the Chekiang Industrial Bank, with 50,835 bags, the sixth was Mao Tai, with 45,636 bags, and the seventh was the Chekiang Industrial Bank, with 23,571 bags. The remaining warehouses all had more than 10,000 bags. The above rice reserve figures are limited to Chinese and foreign warehouses. The amount stored in rice shops and by residents has not yet been investigated. According to the person in charge of the committee yesterday, the amount of rice stored is also more than 600,000 bags. Therefore, the total amount of rice stored in the city is about 1.6 million bags. Calculating consumption at 10,000 bags per day, the above rice reserves are enough for the city's four million residents to eat for more than five months. Therefore, there is no shortage of food for Shanghai residents.

Foreign Rice Arriving in Shanghai in an Endless Stream

Since the authorities of the two concessions actively sought to clear the source of foreign rice, it has gradually achieved results. The number of arrivals has been quite large recently, and large quantities of foreign rice are still en route. According to news from the shipping industry in Shanghai yesterday, within the past ten days, 200,000 bags of foreign rice will be transported from South China to Shanghai. The reporter also learned from the rice industry that Taikoo's "Soochow" ship arrived in Shanghai on the 16th. The ship carried 19,215 bags of tribute rice from Hong Kong and docked at Taikoo Wharf in Pudong. In addition, the company's "Kansu" ship also arrived here from Hong Kong on the 27th. The ship carried 9,265 bags of tribute rice from Hong Kong and docked at Taikoo Wharf in Pudong for unloading. The Hanyang ship also arrived yesterday, also carrying 12,863 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. In addition, the Java Company's Chishari ship also transported a large amount of foreign rice from Hong Kong and docked at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong for unloading. The French postal ship D'Artagnan arrived the day before yesterday (26th), carrying 55,398 bags of foreign rice and 15,153 bags of Dutch rice directly from Saigon, and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.

### Central, China, and Jiangsu Farmers' Banks Can Resume Business Immediately

According to responsible sources who spoke to the Great China News Agency, the Central, China, and Jiangsu Farmers' Banks have received telegrams from the Ministry of Finance ordering them to resume business as soon as possible. They have been actively preparing, hiring workers to repair damaged houses and sorting out business that was suddenly interrupted. Most of the preparations have been completed, and they are scheduled to resume business on the 31st of this month. The staff of each bank usually live peacefully, but after this incident, they are inevitably a little wary. However, the bank will provide effective protection for the safety of the staff at work so that they can work with peace of mind. At the same time, each bank itself is determined to continue its efforts to maintain Shanghai's financial stability as its responsibility lies. Recently, there have been rumors that the Central, China, and other national banks will withdraw from the French Concession. The reporter inquired about this one by one with the staff of the above-mentioned banks, and they all said that it was purely unfounded and not credible. It is also reported that the Central Bank usually has a spring vacation of four days every year, which was from April 1st to 4th last year. This year, it is feared that it will be the same as before. Therefore, it is also rumored that the bank's resumption of business may be after the spring vacation.

### Manager of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company Changes; Contract Expires on the Third of Next Month

The manager of the Shanghai French Concession Water and Electricity Company, Fa Fulei, was promoted from deputy manager to his current position four years ago. His contract expires on April 3rd. At that time, the company's head office in France will appoint someone else to succeed him. It is reported that the former manager, Ke Saier, returned to Shanghai from France last week and will temporarily take over the position of manager because the deputy manager, Hai Yinci, has recently retired. It is believed that the new manager is Mr. Du Keleisi, who is expected to arrive in Shanghai in late April. It is rumored that Fa Fulei will remain in Shanghai after his retirement, but his future whereabouts have not yet been decided.

### British and French Trams Connected Yesterday

After the French Concession Water and Electricity Company labor strike, all tram workers resumed work the day before yesterday. Labor and management are still negotiating on all issues related to improving treatment. All trams in the two concessions have resumed operation. Because the French Electric Company has not yet handed over compensation for losses to the British Tram Company, they have not yet operated mutually after the workers resumed work. Yesterday morning, the British Company's No. 17, 18, 24 trolleybuses and No. 2 trams began to enter the French Concession. The French Company's No. 5 trams and No. 17 and 18 trolleybuses also simultaneously drove into the Public Concession. At this point, the part of the traffic that was open has been fully resolved. Only the part related to treatment remains to be negotiated between labor and management.

### The Entire City Will Fly Flags at Half-Mast Today to Commemorate Revolutionary Martyrs, Remember the Hardships and Greatness of the Founding of the Nation, and Vigorously Implement Frugal Construction and Strengthen Local Work

Today is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang. It has been designated by the central government as the Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Day. The death and martyrdom dates of all party and state veterans such as Deng Zhongyuan, Hu Hanmin, Liao Zhongkai, Chen Yingzhi, Huang Keqiang, and Zhu Zhixin will be commemorated on this day.

Citywide Flags at Half-Mast, Entertainment Stopped

The people of all sectors in Shanghai, in order to commemorate the difficulties and greatness of the sages who created China, have specifically designated today as a day for the entire city to fly flags at half-mast, stop entertainment banquets, engage in spiritual commemoration, stop unconscious gatherings, and promote frugal donation movements to strengthen the work of resisting and building the country. Since the authorities of the two concessions implemented precautions, the order has been exceptionally good. Today, they have decided to step up necessary measures, increase the number of detectives to patrol the roads and guard posts, and search suspicious pedestrians and vehicles. As for unnecessary alleys, roads, and bridges, they do not intend to block them.

Foreign Embassies and Consulates Take a Holiday

Today is the Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Day. The embassies and consulates of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, and other countries stationed in Shanghai will also be closed for one day to express their condolences. Except for temporary important official business, all business will be suspended and will resume office on the 31st (Monday). Yesterday, all foreign nationals were notified separately. Other institutions such as the Jianghai Customs, post office, courts, prisons, and all large and small schools and public groups will also follow the usual practice of taking a day off in addition to flying flags at half-mast to express their condolences.

### Coal Briquette Factory Labor Strike; Authorities Seek to Mediate; Arrested Workers Released

After the coal briquette factory workers in Shanghai went on strike the day before yesterday, more than a thousand charcoal retail stores throughout the city also stopped delivering goods because workers were worried that they would be obstructed by striking workers when delivering goods. The Public Concession authorities believe that coal is a daily necessity for citizens, so they are making every effort to mediate. The Coal Industry Association also convened a meeting yesterday to discuss solutions, but the number of attendees was insufficient, resulting in a quorum not being met and the meeting ending without decisions. More than fifty workers who were arrested the day before yesterday for coercing non-striking workers and obstructing coal briquette delivery trucks were released by the concession authorities at 5:00 p.m. on the same day (the 27th) after interrogation.

Factory Side's Attitude

According to the factory side, the sudden strike by coal briquette factory workers was completely unknown to the factory beforehand. Most of the workers in the factory were also unable to foresee it beforehand. Only a few days ago, it was discovered that some people came to the factory to solicit workers to join the union. After the strike, there was no request made to the factory, so the factory had no way to contact them. Therefore, they can only request the authorities to find a solution as soon as possible to avoid affecting the lives of citizens. It is rumored that last month, the labor side made a request to increase wages by 40%.

Workers' Opinions

According to the workers, among all industries in Shanghai, other industries have improved their treatment in the face of rising prices, but only the workers in the charcoal and coal industry still follow the old practices of five or six years ago and adopt the lowest wages. Although there are a few manufacturers who have made slight improvements due to substantial profits, they are only a small fraction. Therefore, last month, after careful consideration, they prepared ten compromise plans and sent them to four colleagues in the industry for adoption and implementation. After waiting for a long time, they did not receive a reply. Then, they separately asked the authorities of both Shanghai and the concession to mediate. The four colleagues did not accept, which is why the workers went on strike.

### Fellow Villagers from Fenghua in Shanghai Raise Funds to Relieve Famine in Their Hometown

Fellow villagers from Fenghua in Shanghai, in view of the serious famine in their hometown, where middle-class families have money but no rice, and the common people are waiting to die, resulting in widespread misery and starvation, the situation is unprecedentedly tragic. They specifically invited fellow villagers from Fenghua in Shanghai a few days ago to hold a meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to establish the Fenghua Fellow Villagers in Shanghai Relief Fundraising Committee. Many members attended the meeting. Fang Jiaobo and Gui Yanfang from the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association also attended and participated. Zheng Yuanxing was elected as the chairman, Sun Xingzhi and Zhou Jingting as the vice-chairmen, He Mengxiong and Fang Jichuan as the finance committee members, Yu Hualong as the secretary-general, and Wang Lianfang and others as the standing committee members. Hong Xinfu and others were elected as fundraising committee members. The total amount of fundraising is 200,000 yuan. The fundraising period is until the end of April in the Gregorian calendar. The Zhejiang Local Bank, Siming Bank, Dalai Bank, and Rui Tai Silver Store are designated as donation collection points. It is heard that half of the donations have already been pledged on the spot. The remaining amount will be solicited by the committee members immediately.

### Storing Dangerous Materials Requires a License

The Public Concession Public Works Department specially issued Notice No. 5417 yesterday regarding the storage of explosives, gunpowder, petroleum, and other dangerous materials. The notice states that anyone who stores materials that are dangerous in nature or sufficient to endanger life and property and can cause injury, and for public safety, special precautions are necessary, must apply to the department for a license in accordance with the provisions of Article 35 of the Land Regulations. It is hoped that the public will pay attention and earnestly comply with the notice.

### The Number of Directors is Being Negotiated; Elections May Be Avoided; Three Consuls-General Negotiate Through Diplomatic Channels to Maintain the Balance of Power in the Concession

The next board election of the Public Concession Public Works Department has been postponed for a week after the announcement. Currently, British Consul George, American Consul Lockhart, and Japanese Consul Horiuchi are jointly consulting to resolve the issue satisfactorily through diplomatic channels. British community leader Casey (the current chairman) and Japanese Residents Group Chairman Watanabe are also conducting side negotiations. It is expected that there will be a full decision in the next two days, and a list of candidates will be formally submitted to the Public Works Department on April 1. According to well-informed sources yesterday, the election may be avoided.

Britain and the United States are Unwilling to Disrupt the Status Quo

The current situation of the Public Works Department is that there are seven British and American directors and seven Chinese and Japanese directors. The chairman is appointed by the British and American directors. The chairman only has the right to vote when the motions are deadlocked. If the number of Japanese directors increases by two in the next term, and the current Chinese directors encounter serious difficulties in the current environment, then the Japanese side can easily control the administration of the concession, which will disrupt the status quo. This is clearly not what the British and American communities want. Therefore, the three consuls-general have decided to seek a win-win solution in the negotiations, increasing the number of Japanese directors on the one hand and maintaining the status quo on the other. According to those familiar with the inside story,

Changes in the Number of People Must Maintain Equilibrium

The so-called win-win solution is nothing more than the following routes: (1) The number of British and Chinese directors is reduced from five to four, and the number of American and Japanese directors is increased from two to three. The British and American and Japanese and Chinese each occupy seven seats, maintaining the equilibrium. However, the reduction in the number of Chinese directors will inevitably arouse widespread opposition. Therefore, the Chinese directors will still be five, but one seat will be vacant in rotation as a compromise. (2) The British and Chinese directors are still five each, and the American and Japanese directors are increased to five each, which can also maintain the status quo. (3) The British and Chinese directors remain the same, and the American and Japanese directors are increased to three each to maintain equilibrium. Among the above three options, the latter is the most likely. Once agreed, the election can be avoided.

Date of Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers

Consul-General Hill recently issued a notice stating that the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers will be held on April 17 (Thursday). At that time, the method of raising municipal funds will be discussed, the relevant motions on fundraising will be passed, other municipal facilities will be decided, and the Public Works Department's accounts for the previous year will be approved. As for the location and time of the meeting, the Public Works Department will announce it after deciding.

### Citizens Should Not Give Money to Beggars; Chairman of the Shelter Suggests; Rotary Club Has Not Decided

At the Rotary Club meeting the day before yesterday, the chairman of the club's Beggar Shelter Committee, Hague, made a suggestion, advocating that citizens should not give money directly to beggars, so that beggars throughout the city can be eliminated. It is said that it is better to use the money to help the poor than to give money to beggars every day. If this matter can be implemented, beggars on the streets will soon disappear. It is also said that giving money to beggars every day is tantamount to paying to encourage them to stay on the streets. Therefore, as long as someone gives money to beggars one day, beggars cannot be eliminated one day. Hague advocated that citizens should give what they give to beggars every day to the organization that can deal with the problem, which will be more effective than giving alms. He also asked Chinese and foreigners not to give alms to beggars for two weeks. However, the Rotary Club has not made any decision on this suggestion.

### Awaiting American Weapons to Determine the Sino-Japanese War; After the Arrival of American Flying Fortresses, the Chinese Army Will Launch a General Counteroffensive

An editorial in the Continental Daily News said that the news about Dr. Corley's proposal to the US government to aid China, as reported by the New York and Washington newspapers, is indeed credible and there is little reason to doubt it. Corley traveled to free China, conducted an investigation, and said before leaving for the United States, "What China needs is very little, and what the United States can give is very much. I am sure that you will get all the assistance you need."

Corley's Proposal Will Be Approved

The proposal transmitted by Corley stated that China only needs 20 Flying Fortress bombers, 200 of the latest fighter planes, some aviation gasoline, steel war equipment, and some artillery and ammunition. All of these can be transported to China within a few days after President Roosevelt's approval, and it is certain that President Roosevelt will approve Corley's proposal, because President Roosevelt said in his recent speech, "China has asked the United States for assistance through Chairman Chiang, and we have replied that China will certainly receive our assistance."

Once War Equipment is Obtained, a Counterattack Will Be Launched

It is quite obvious that China is eager to obtain American assistance. Not long ago, Chairman Chiang said in a speech that China would launch a general counteroffensive and implement an effective counteroffensive as soon as it received the war equipment promised by the United States. Since there is an urgent need for artillery and aircraft, it is expected that the first batch of war equipment arriving in China will include artillery and aircraft. The Flying Fortress bomber is most useful to China. Since the start of the war in the summer of 1937, China has been unable to counterattack Japan due to the lack of long-range bombers. Japan has repeatedly bombed the Chinese capital and other important towns, but after China obtains the expected famous American Flying Fortress, it will not only be able to fly to the most remote corners of the Chinese front line, but also be able to show its power in Tokyo and other extremely important cities in Japan. The arrival of these bombers and other military supplies in China will be a turning point in determining the Sino-Japanese War.

### Airmail Service Opened Between Qingdao and Kaifeng

A notice from the Postal Administration stated that airmail service has been opened between Qingdao and Kaifeng, with stops at Haizhou, Tongshan (Xuzhou), and Shangqiu (Guide). Flights depart from Qingdao and Kaifeng every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. In the future, airmail to Shangqiu (Guide) and Haizhou will be accepted by the Bureau and forwarded from Tongshan (Xuzhou). The entire journey will be carried by aircraft. Airmail to Kaifeng, which is currently forwarded from Peiping, will also be forwarded from Tongshan (Xuzhou) in the future. The additional airmail postage required is the same as that for other occupied areas in North China, Central China, and South China, that is, 36 cents of national currency for each 20 grams of letter or its odd number, and 18 cents for each postcard. In addition, from April 1 of this year, the airmail service between Shanghai and Guangzhou has been increased from two flights per week to three flights per week. This is to notify the public.

### Culture on Rue Lafayette

— Wei

Rue Lafayette is a fairly long and spacious road, leading directly to the Old West Gate in the east, now blocked by iron gates; it ends in the west at Avenue Joffre, where it connects with Route Tenant de la Tour. Traffic has also become more convenient in the past two years. There are Route 21 buses from Dapu Bridge to the Bund on Avenue Edouard VII, and Route 24 trolleybuses from Route Robert to the Old West Gate passing through, gradually making the eastern half of Rue Lafayette prosperous. West of Rue Luban, there are bright, wide sidewalks on both sides, where you can stroll under the tall plane trees, while admiring the flowers and trees in the French park and residential gardens, and listening to the little birds singing in the branches, making music for the strollers. That's quite interesting. But I love the short stretch of this road at the east end even more, the distance from Route de Saypoce to Route Baron Gros, nearly two hundred yards, which is full of lively atmosphere and new vitality. Although the stalls on both sides block the road and the city sounds are noisy, this is not enough to detract from this section of the road.

In addition to Datong University and Middle School in the Lawyers Association building, there are seven or eight small schools in the nearby area. There is also a church. Every day in the morning, noon, and evening, several hundred male and female students go to school or return home from school, passing through. These school-age children wear different colors of clothes, carrying schoolbags, running and jumping to school or home. Some are pretty, some are ugly, some are clean, and some are ragged; but they are all full of innocent childishness and pure beauty. I like to stroll on this section of the road when these children are released from school, mixed in with the crowd of innocent children, walking back and forth, listening to them talking and laughing along the way, or learning to sing a new song that their teacher has just taught them. Their happiness seems to make me return to their school age and feel the same happiness. Sometimes, when it's time for school lunch, I wait at the school gate to greet my children when they come out of school. When they suddenly find their father waiting for them at the school gate, how happy they are! Just like when mom and dad come home from outside and suddenly bring them many exquisite snacks, candies, or toys, the children feel the same unexpected happiness. Therefore, my children often want me to greet them in front of the school gate at lunchtime, but I always tell them that I will not come again. But I often linger in front of their school's church in the afternoon when school is dismissed, where there are also some ordinary grass flowers and evergreens planted. Children always like their parents to give them unexpected favors.

### Salvation Army Brigadier Bertje Morris Transferred to Serve in Canada; Has Been Engaged in Disaster Relief in China for Twenty Years; Awarded Certificate by the Chinese Government for His Hard Work

Salvation Army Brigadier Bertje Morris, who has been engaged in Salvation Army disaster relief work in China for twenty years, is scheduled to leave Shanghai on April 5 to serve in Canada. As for where he will be transferred to in Canada and who his successor will be, it is still unknown.

Distinguished Work and Hard Work in China

Mr. Morris was originally from Salisbury, England, and was trained at the Salvation Army International Training College in the United Kingdom. He was sent to China in November 1921 to learn Chinese and was sent to the Chinese mainland after six months to promote the Salvation Army's work. He was supported by the Chinese government and Madame Chiang Kai-shek. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Mr. Morris came to Shanghai from Nanjing to provide relief to refugees, sparing no effort. Recently, he also opened a beggar shelter. The Chinese government has awarded Mr. Morris an honorary certificate for his outstanding service in China. Mr. Morris will travel to Canada with his wife and young son.

### King of Slot Machines Arrested Again - Escaped from American Prison Before - Arrested and Bailed Out in Shanghai, then Fled - Changed Name and Hid, Finally Recaptured

The English language "North China Daily News" reports: Jack La Rue, the "King of Slot Machines," was accused of running gambling dens in the United States. Last year, after being detained, he was released on bail and fled to avoid punishment. However, the American authorities were very diligent in their pursuit and finally discovered that Jack had changed his name to John Beck and was

hiding in Hongkou,

at 24 Yangcun, Zha Pu Road. This morning (the 28th) at 9:45 AM, the American authorities dispatched Enforcement Officer Teteilberg, together with officers from the Shanghai Municipal Police and Japanese police officers, to the address. They went straight into Jack's bedroom but did not find him. After searching the attic on the roof, they finally discovered Jack hiding inside and arrested him. He was taken to the American authorities for a brief interrogation and then sent back to the Ward Road Gaol. It is expected that the American authorities will soon open the trial of this case. Jack had

fled to avoid punishment,

gaining only three months and fourteen days of freedom. It is noted that Jack was arrested in front of the Great China Theater on September 20 of last year. He was imprisoned in the Ward Road Gaol and, after a few days, was released on bail of US$25,000. When he was tried in the American authorities on February 4, the authorities had already determined that Jack had committed a theft in the United States more than ten years ago, been sentenced to 25 years in prison, and escaped from prison. Because both crimes were exposed, Jack

finally fell into the clutches of the law.

In recent years, Jack has been running gambling dens such as "slot machines" in Shanghai, accumulating a considerable fortune. He currently owns the New Manhattan Tavern. It is rumored that Jack won the tavern by gambling with dice.

### Morphine Hidden Inside Walnuts - Totaling Eight Hundred - Main Culprit Wang Fukui on the Run

Zhang Zhide, a 34-year-old man from Haizhou, arrived in Shanghai recently on the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s "Ding Sheng" steamship from Incheon. At 5:00 PM on the 17th, when he arrived at the Roosevelt Wharf (i.e., China Merchants Wharf) on the Bund in the French Concession, he was carrying a burlap bag of walnuts in his luggage, containing between 1600 and 1700 nuts of varying sizes. Detective Qian Xishan inspected the luggage. Out of curiosity, he picked up a walnut, cracked it open to eat the meat, and unexpectedly found a small waxed paper packet inside. He opened the packet and found it contained the drug morphine. He immediately detained Zhang for questioning. According to his confession, there were a total of 800 walnuts, which had been split open, the meat removed, and paper packets of morphine inserted. The shells were then glued back together to deceive inspectors. The goods were brought from Tianjin to Shanghai by Wang Fukui, who was waiting at the Yong'an Hotel on Daxin Street in the British Concession. Detective Qian immediately took Zhang and the evidence back to the police station. He then worked with the Zhabei Police Station to send detectives to the Yong'an Hotel to arrest Wang Fukui. However, Wang had already fled after hearing the news. The detectives reported back to the police chief, who ordered Zhang to be detained pending investigation and legal proceedings. At the same time, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Wang Fukui for interrogation.

### Kidnapping of University Student - All Bandits Have Been Arrested - Principal Offender Liang Yuxu Was a Former Detective - Car Used in Kidnapping Also Recovered

Cheng Zeji, residing at 834 Connaught Road, was studying at Fudan University at 574 Hart Road. At 1:50 PM on the 18th of this month, Cheng drove his own car, number 3895, to the school to study. Unexpectedly, near the school gate, he was suddenly confronted by several kidnappers armed with weapons.

They blocked the car and, under threat, forced Cheng into the car prepared by the kidnappers, number 7546, and drove quickly westward. When the car passed the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Haig Road, it happened to encounter a search team from the Public Concession Police. Sensing an opportunity to escape, Cheng jumped out of the car, injuring himself in the fall. The kidnappers, realizing they were exposed, also drove away. Cheng was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Recently, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station have successively arrested

the criminals involved in the case, including 21-year-old Ningbo woman Wang Wenying, and Li Jiliang, Zhang Hongxiang, Dong Jinchun, Wang Xiaoerzi, Dai Jinbiao, and Mark Bai. According to Zhang Hongxiang's confession, there was another accomplice named Liang Chengyu who was on the run. At the time, there were two pistols, which were stored with Liang. There was also a car (i.e., the one driven by the kidnappers at the time), which was purchased on March 20 for the price of 2,000 yuan and is now hidden at 909 Beile Road in the French Concession. The police went to investigate and indeed recovered the car, number 7546. They then went to a certain hospital at 19 Peng Road and

arrested Liang. It was found that Liang, also known as Zheng Guang, was originally from Shandong. He used to be an undercover detective in the Public Concession Police, but was later detained for a kidnapping case and sentenced to life imprisonment. Liang appealed and had his sentence reduced to seven years of imprisonment. He was released after serving his term, and several years have passed. Now he has been arrested again on suspicion of kidnapping. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, requesting permission for detention and joint trial. The court ordered that Liang Chengyu be detained pending further review at a later date.

### Two Cars Collide on Nanjing Road

Yesterday morning at approximately 8:45 AM, a streetcar of a certain line of the Public Concession, traveling from Jing'an Temple towards the Bund, was passing in front of the Women's Bank on Nanjing Road when a Japanese naval soldier riding a motorcycle came speeding from east to west. When the motorcycle was about to pass the streetcar, the naval soldier driving the motorcycle did not follow the rule of "keeping to the left," causing it to crash directly into the streetcar. The driver of the streetcar braked urgently but could not avoid the collision. The motorcycle was slightly damaged, and traffic was temporarily halted. As a result, the streetcars were all blocked and stopped, extending to the edge of the racecourse like a long snake. Traffic was disrupted for more than forty minutes.

### Extortion of Bookstore Owner - Two Criminals Arrested for Investigation

Li Hongfa, the owner of the Dajiang Bookstore at 502 Avenue Edward VII, suddenly received a threatening letter delivered by gangsters on the 25th of this month. The letter contained strong language and demanded 1,000 yuan, instructing Li to send the money to a certain book stall at 619 Avenue Edward VII. The person coming to collect the money would be holding a copy of the "North China Daily News" as a sign. Li reported the information to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched detectives Wang Shilian and Xu Shutian to wait in ambush. They placed a paper package, made to look like 1,000 yuan in legal tender, on the book stall. The day before yesterday afternoon, Ke Baolin from Danyang and Liu Dajue from Shandong came and took the paper package, hiding it on their person. They were arrested by the detectives and taken to the police station. They confessed that the scheme was masterminded by Huang Jinrong, who was at large. They were ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, requesting a postponement. Judge Liu questioned the two defendants briefly and ordered them to be detained pending further review at a later trial.

### Embezzlement of Large Sums Leads to Conviction

Wu Xinhai, from Ningbo, residing at 9, Lane 195, Macgregor Road, previously partnered with Xu Yecheng to open the Wan Tai Hardware Store at 540 Ningbo Road. Recently, Xu discovered that Wu had embezzled 37,500 yuan in goods and entrusted lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to report the matter to the police station. The police dispatched detectives to arrest Wu Xinhai and bring him to the First Special District Court. The court ordered Wu to post 30,000 yuan in bail to be released pending judgment. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu presided over the Second Criminal Court and sentenced Wu Xinhai to eight months' imprisonment for continuous embezzlement of items held in the course of business. A civil suit was attached, to be transferred to the Civil Court for trial, with the stolen goods to be returned to the owner.

Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the local temperature reached a high of 48.6 and a low of 43.9. On the same day last year, the high was 69.8 and the low was 41.0.

### Principal of Lequn Middle School, Tao Guangchuan, Suddenly Arrested - Usually Enthusiastic About Education - No Other Activities

Yesterday afternoon at 3:21 PM, seven people from a certain quarter, along with a foreign detective, suddenly broke into the office of Lequn Middle School at 970 Avenue Edward VII and conducted a thorough search. At the time, all teachers and staff were also under surveillance. They then broke into the principal's office and bedroom on the second floor and searched repeatedly, but found nothing. At 3:30 PM, these eight people took Principal Tao Guangchuan away. It is noted that Principal Tao is the founder of Lequn Middle School. He is usually enthusiastic about education and works hard for the public. He has no other activities. Therefore, the reason for this arrest is difficult to guess. It is heard that Principal Tao is currently detained in the Central Police Station.

### The Power of Blood

— Yan Zheng

Blood is never shed in vain, nor will it be shed in vain.

The blood of the seventy-two martyrs finally stirred up the surging revolutionary tide, finally destroying the throne of autocracy.

The Northern Expedition... all the same. In a word: bloodshed!

Being stingy with blood is wrong. It should be shed as needed, shed.

The debt of blood needs to be repaid with blood. Fearing to shed a drop of blood only leads to more blood being shed, shed in vain.

Commemorating the martyrs should not be just lip service, on paper. We should understand the value of blood and strive for the price of blood!

Women

### My Cheekbones

— Qiu Sheng

I dare not call myself a liberated modern woman, but in education, I have enjoyed the "equality between men and women." Like ordinary men, from elementary school, middle school, to university. This can also be said to be a rare gain for a few women in the clamor for "liberating women"!

I don't know whether I should celebrate or mourn this precious gain because I have come to know more of the pain that women should not have.

A woman's appearance is more important than her learning. If you don't believe me, look at the wedding hall, plastered with magnificent gold-lettered banners like "talented man and beautiful woman" and "scholar and beauty." Why should they praise women with "appearance" and men with "talent"? I think this is at least somewhat insulting to women. But, it was like this in the past, and it is still like this now.

If I were a man, I might be called a handsome and capable beautiful youth, but unfortunately, I am a woman. Don't think I'm an ugly girl with thick eyebrows and big eyes. I'm not bragging at all: I have fair skin, and well-proportioned ears, eyes, mouth, and nose. The only flaw is that my cheekbones are slightly high. Isn't it true that high cheekbones on a man would only add to his handsome and capable appearance? But I am not a man!

"A woman with high cheekbones kills her husband without a knife." When I was studying in a girls' middle school, many female classmates criticized me this way behind my back. I was startled by their comments. I secretly often touched my raised cheekbones in the mirror. I feel very sorry for them, what bad luck to be born on a woman's face! I thought again: What relationship do a woman's cheekbones have with her husband? I laughed, laughing at those classmates who criticized me, for being unscientific. If female students are like this, it's no wonder ignorant old women in the countryside are superstitious!

But rock-solid facts are the most powerful arguments. What else can I say?

Ten years ago, when I was a sophomore in college, I fell in love with a sophomore in engineering, and he loved me too. In less than a year, our feelings surpassed friendship, and in the spring of the second year, with the consent of both parents, we got engaged in Shanghai. We both felt that our marriage was proceeding smoothly and were very satisfied. Yes, the classmates were all envious of us. We planned to hold our wedding in the first winter after graduation. If possible, we also wanted to take our honeymoon trip in the spring after the winter. Like ordinary young women, I was looking forward to a beautiful future life. Alas! Who knew that this was just a fantasy, a fantasy that could never be realized!

It is truly a case of "rare misfortune," unfortunately falling on a woman with high cheekbones like me.

During a summer vacation after we got engaged, my fiancé contracted a seasonal epidemic and passed away. The news was like a bolt from the blue, and I cried for several nights because of it.

But, society is ruthless. It not only refuses to show any sympathy to those who have been severely wounded but makes the heartbroken even more sad.

My fiancé died, and thus "A woman with high cheekbones kills her husband without a knife," was confirmed and spread throughout the school. From then on, my classmates became distant from me, as if my cheekbones could not only kill my husband but also harm friends who were close to me. So, I began to feel lonely. At the same time, I felt particularly sorry for my slightly high cheekbones.

Yesterday the weather was very nice. I was sorting out my clothes in the sunlight and inadvertently found my fiancé's portrait, which had been pressed under the box for more than ten years. Ten years ago seems like yesterday. The person in the portrait is still smiling at me, but I am no longer the person I was ten years ago! My heart now is like a dry well, no longer stirred by waves! I have been rejected by the people around me, labeled with terms like "husband killer" and "widow waiting at the gate"! I have been shrouded in the giant hand of the devil, the giant hand wants to push me into the dark abyss. I cannot break free from the shackles left by the old society. Although I have new ideas, where can I go to express them?

I am old, spring belongs to young people, but among young women, who can guarantee that they will not be born with high cheekbones formed by physiology? I held my smiling person in the portrait and cried bitterly.

### Good Education

— Ping

The best education in the world comes from the struggle for survival. Because this is also the most practical knowledge.

The secret of education lies in respecting and recognizing students. Therefore, teachers with high academic qualifications are not necessarily the best teachers.

Investing in knowledge often yields the highest interest.

It is absolutely not permissible to only educate children to become gentlemen or ladies. Educate them to become useful men and useful women. (Walking University).

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(5) The Division Between Love and Desire

Xiangqi had been standing right behind him all along, answering his questions very quickly, but this time she deliberately did not answer.

"Is he your cousin?" Begonia suddenly turned around and asked bluntly.

Xiangqi couldn't help but chuckle.

"Cousin? Did he tell you that himself? How can this person not guess! He is my own brother, and he is still recovering from his illness in the south. We were closest when we were little!"

"Why couldn't I be born into her family?" Another regret, Begonia thought.

But the further he flipped, the more regrets he had because many of the photos were not of Xiangqi alone. Some of the people who were photographed with her were relatives, and some were classmates. In Begonia's eyes, these people were all very lucky, which made him feel inferior.

Until the mute maid brought out a basket of freshly steamed meat buns, he hadn't seen the last page.

"When are you planning to return to Beijing?" Xiangqi asked after eating a few buns with her special guest and putting down her chopsticks.

"I don't want to go on stage for the time being, so it doesn't matter if I stay here for a few more days." Begonia almost wanted to say, "I hope to be able to talk to you often, as long as Yuan, the Garrison Commander, doesn't come, I won't leave."

Although he didn't say the words, Xiangqi had already understood them in her heart.

"You can come here for lunch tomorrow. As long as we are careful, you can come here often."

From then on, Begonia did come to the Luo's house three times in a row. In both form and spirit, they couldn't help but reveal a kind of passion, but both sides knew how to restrain themselves. Even in the most excited moments, they would only smile at each other.

Later, almost all the performers and his subordinates in the troupe went back. Zhao Si also repeatedly told him that if there was nothing important, it would be better to return to Beijing sooner. At the same time, Yuan Shaowen also sent him a quick letter, telling him that he had returned to Beijing from Chengde and saw the telegram he had sent a few days ago. He didn't know if the Tianjin matter had been settled and hoped that he would reply in a letter as soon as possible, or simply return to Beijing to discuss it in person. This made Begonia decide to leave the next day. (67)

### "Red-Headed Woman"

— Huang Xinde

"Red-Headed Woman" is about the life story of the actress Li Silians Kader. There have been many Hollywood works in the past that have used the background of actresses as themes, so the theme of "Red-Headed Woman" is not necessarily new. However, the story itself has many joys and sorrows, so the performance is quite moving.

The story begins with Li Silians losing her beloved son due to divorce. Then, it writes about her suffering social criticism, so she is angry and goes to act, hoping that after she becomes famous, she can regain her beloved son and social warmth. However, although she is successful in art, American society in the 19th century still despised Li Silians's personality. Her beloved son was separated from her for a long time and was unwilling to be close to her, so Li Silians had to work hard for art with a wounded heart.

Of course, the story of the whole film will not be so simple. Of course, it has to add her romantic threads. At first glance, it seems that the playwright is trying to criticize the feudal forces at the time, but the director takes this point lightly and tries to show how she struggled to embark on the road to success. For example, she was coldly received when she first took a letter of introduction to see the famous playwright Klaus Trelane, and she waited from dusk to late at night when she visited again. Finally, this playwright could not refuse his feelings and wrote a script for her. She then ascended the dragon gate and her wealth increased tenfold. These scenes are all where the director used all his energy to describe Li Silians's success, which was not accidental.

Although Manlin Hawkins is old and frail, she still feels that she is the right person to play such a middle-aged woman. Especially a woman like Li Silians Kader is particularly suitable for her personality, so the performance is even more moving. Among the supporting actors, the playwright of Klaus Trelane plays the best. This public is a versatile actor who can play any role. In this film, he just plays it even more brilliantly. If the director could have handled the climax of the whole play more powerfully, then the performance of this play would have been even better than it is now.

### Drama News

— Jue Xin

Since Zhou Xinfang had a bout of exhaustion typhoid fever last year, he was so eager to go on stage that he did not take good care of himself, so he has not fully recovered his health. He relapsed a month ago. Fortunately, the illness was not serious, and after a very short period of rest, he met with audiences again. Unexpectedly, he fell ill again the day before yesterday, which made his friends who loved him very happy.

Yesterday, the reporter spoke to Zhou's wife on the phone, and she happily said that the old brand of Qilin has already taken medicine, and he is scheduled to go on stage tonight after the illness. This news is worth comforting to the fans of Qilin. As for Qilin's exhaustion and typhoid fever illness last summer, it was entirely caused by singing and performing voluntary performances for the Shanghai Actors' Association Preservation Committee too hard and too tiring. In the beginning, the Actors' Association had an incident of selling Liyuanfang, and Zhou Xinfang strongly opposed it. He published an article in the newspaper, calling on all the actors to retain their ancestral property. As a result, he received the sympathy of a group of young actors such as Gao Baisui, Zhang Yipeng, Li Ruilai, and Li Shunlai, who responded one after another. Only then did the Actors' Association dispel the idea of selling, and they organized a Preservation Committee to perform plays to raise money to repay debts. Xinfang was of course particularly enthusiastic about this matter, but after all, he was almost fifty years old, and he was physically exhausted, so he suffered a serious illness. Now that Liyuanfang has been completely redeemed, this credit naturally belongs to Xinfang.

Chapter 4: Swallow Kicks Flying Flowers Falling on the Dance Banquet

Before Li Xin could answer, the woman in red, who had been paying attention, walked up slowly, gave Li Xin a blessing, and said in fluent Mandarin, "Master Li, please don't be offended. I have long heard that Master Li is a generous and righteous young man. Meeting you today is a blessing." Li Xin was originally about to explode, but now that he saw that these two people were speaking very humbly, and he had also seen that the woman's skills were not ordinary, the anger in his chest had long since dissipated, and he could no longer blame them. He could only say, "You are flattering me like this, I am ashamed to deserve it. However, I have always forbidden people to sell their art in front of my manor, so my servants came to drive you away. Now I forgive you for not knowing the rules, and I will ask you to stop performing at once. If you lack travel expenses, I can help you with some later." The big man and the scholar both smiled and thanked him, "Master Li's words are correct, we dare not disobey. We will pack up immediately and pay our respects to Master Li at the manor." After the two men finished speaking, they turned back and picked up the bamboo pole on the ground and packed up hastily with their companions. Many people watching the excitement saw that Li Xin had in effect given them an order to leave, but they were very obedient, which showed that Li Xin's power was formidable. The lively scene dispersed, and everyone else dispersed as well. Xu Jing was eager to go home, so he didn't stay any longer and said goodbye to Li Xin. Li Xin was now walking slowly towards the gate of the manor with his hands behind his back and his head down in thought. Turning around, he saw that the big man and the woman in red had brought their companions to the manor. He had spoken first, but he could not refuse, so he greeted them to the hall inside. After they were seated, the injured servant saw that the master not only did not avenge him, but brought the performers in, which was very strange, so he also came in to call out to Li Xin. When the big man saw him, he took out a plaster and said to the servant, "We were careless just now and offended you. Fortunately, it was not a serious injury. I will give you this plaster to put on. It will be completely fine after three days. Please forgive me." When the servant saw that the big man said this, and that Li Xin did not show any expression, he had no choice but to accept the plaster and retreat. (24)

### An Interview with the "Children's Drama Society"

— Mu Er

Since the departure of the "Children's Troupe" from Shanghai, among the children's acting troupes, it seems that only one "Children's Drama Society" has achieved relatively noticeable results.

Recently, learning that the "Children's Drama Society" would hold its fourth public performance at the Ningbo Guild Hall to celebrate Children's Day, I went to conduct a brief interview.

Entering the drama society's door, they were rehearsing "Children's Day" and "King Kong". In order not to disrupt their work, I listened quietly on the side. It turned out that "Children's Day" exposes the different lives of students and suffering children on Children's Day. "King Kong" is a fairy tale play, depicting how the residents of "Happy Village" repelled King Kong thousands of years ago.

Later, I asked someone in the drama society about their past situation and future direction. According to him, the purpose of this drama society is to promote normal entertainment for children, unleash children's surplus energy, and have children perform plays for children, hoping to replace early morning movies with children's dramas. In the past, in addition to performing in large theaters, they also went to orphanages and other places to perform in rotation. This "Children's Day" is a collaboration with a certain orphanage.

After hearing such a description, I felt that the work of the "Children's Drama Society" was very meaningful. If they continue to work hard, the future is limitless.

### The Philosophy of a Striving Life

Where is the way to solve a problem? It is that in the midst of difficulties, you first clearly understand the essence of the difficulty, and the solution will leap out. Therefore, thinking of a solution out of thin air will definitely not be a true solution!
