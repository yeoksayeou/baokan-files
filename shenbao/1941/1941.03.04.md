At 6:30 PM, the meeting was adjourned. (Third day dispatch)

Chongqing. The Fifth Plenary Session of the previous National Political Council was held in April of last year. Between that session and this session, there was a gap of ten months. During this period, important developments occurred in the domestic and international situation. After listening to the government's report, the councilors raised many inquiries, including the following regarding foreign affairs: (1) the truth about the Japanese advance southward and our countermeasures; (2) the government's countermeasures against the German-Italian-Japanese alliance; (3) the inside story of Japan's attempt to conclude a treaty with the Soviet Union; (4) the true meaning of Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke's statement that he wanted to conquer Oceania; (5) whether Mr. Colebrook's visit to China resulted in any concrete agreements with our government regarding aid to China. Regarding economic matters, there were inquiries about: (1) recent proposals for the government to monopolize the sale of grain and the government's opinion on this; (2) whether future trade policies would adopt control measures or free trade policies; (3) the high prices in various rear areas and whether the government has more effective measures to stabilize prices; (4) the inconsistency of price indices in various regions and whether the government has concrete measures to ensure the smooth flow of goods in the future. The heads of the competent authorities have agreed to provide answers to all of the above cases on a scheduled basis. (Third day dispatch)

Chongqing. The Central News Agency stated yesterday that this session of the National Political Council will resolve the disagreements between various political parties, the price issue, and constitutional matters. The Central News Agency also reported that when the meeting was held on Saturday, due to the absence of the Communist Party representatives, Jiao Jiasen of the National Socialist Party and the famous educator Huang Yanpei proposed postponing the meeting on Saturday afternoon to allow the Communist Party representatives to reconsider. The proposal was passed by an average annual decline, but the Communist Party still hesitated, so the meeting continued. (Third day, United Press dispatch)

### Chairman Chiang's Address at the Second National Political Council Meeting: Strive for Final Victory and Complete Secure National Defense

Chongqing. Chairman Chiang addressed the opening day (2nd) of the First Plenary Session of the Second National Defense Political Council, originally stating: "Fellow councilors, today is the first gathering of the Second National Political Council. On behalf of the National Defense Supreme Council, I extend a warm welcome to all councilors. As this arduous war enters its fifth year, with our entire nation concentrating its efforts in a struggle for survival, it is of utmost importance that our nation's talented individuals deliberate on national affairs. Councilors from the occupied provinces have overcome dangers and difficulties to attend this meeting. This spirit of jointly facing national disaster and sharing the same boat is truly a most precious and glorious memorial in the history of our nation's struggle. Recalling the establishment of the First Political Council on the anniversary of the first year of the war, over the past three years, through five gatherings, you have assisted the government, implemented national policies, and made significant contributions to resistance and reconstruction. This consistent sincerity and magnificent strength has not only attracted worldwide attention but has also inspired the military and civilians throughout the country. Now, the world situation is becoming more tense, and the situation of our country's war is becoming more important. Therefore, the mission of this council is not only to inherit the glorious achievements of the previous council but also to adapt to the needs of our new situation of resistance and reconstruction and to make further progress. The expectations of the military and civilians throughout the country and the government for you, gentlemen, are therefore even greater and more important. Today, I would first like to make a brief report on the government's policy direction since the convocation of the Political Council and the situation of both China and Japan, and take this opportunity to state my personal beliefs about the future of the country. Since the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang resolved the Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction, and the First Political Council unanimously resolved to support it in July of the 27th year, this outline has become the creed followed by the military and civilians throughout the country and the fundamental policy direction of the wartime government. Each time the Political Council meets, it proposes many important proposals based on this outline. For the past three years, the government's work can be said to be entirely based on the

Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction and striving to comply with the resolutions of the Political Council. The detailed process will be reported by various Yuan, ministries, and commissions. The situation since the last adjournment will be left to the relevant departments to report in detail. Broadly speaking, the main purpose of all government decisions is to seek the growth of combat power and the establishment of a national reconstruction scale. The preliminary work of national reconstruction is mainly to create the rule of law, prepare for constitutional rule, and promote local self-government below the county level to complete political construction. At the same time, we must strengthen production, develop transportation, improve people's livelihoods, and implement economic controls to vigorously promote economic construction. Due to various factual limitations and the evolution of the war situation, many have not yet achieved full effectiveness. In this regard, the government will strive to promote in the future and hopes that this Council will do its best to assist in order to thoroughly complete it. Looking back at the evolution of the situation between China and Japan over the past two years, it can be said to be completely in line with what we expected at the beginning of our decision to wage war.

Completely consistent. Since the war entered its second phase, the Japanese have gradually been in a military stalemate. Although the Japanese blindly advanced in southern Guangxi and western Hubei, the Japanese troops in southern Guangxi eventually collapsed last autumn, and the Japanese troops in western Hubei are also in a dilemma. Looking at the overall war situation, the Japanese have become tired and their troops are exhausted, while our combat strength and attacking spirit are on the rise. The Japanese military has now been deeply mired in the quagmire, and it can be said that the Japanese have already realized their failure. In terms of diplomacy, the Japanese, knowing that they have completely failed militarily and cannot be salvaged, have had no choice but to speculate and seek opportunities,妄想在外交上

Seeking a way out. They have sometimes enticed and sometimes threatened the countries concerned in East Asia, but today, the friendly nations not only clearly recognize that there is no room for compromise with Japan, but they also have a deep belief in China's inevitable victory. The friendly nations not only unanimously reject Japan's inducements and threats but also continue to increase their assistance to us. All countries whose interests are related to the Pacific have seen through Japan's endless ambitions and have taken resolute steps. The situation in the Pacific is becoming clearer, which is the greatest internal fear of the Japanese and a sign of the thorough clarification of the world situation. In the political field, the Japanese have been constantly creating peace rumors over the past few years in an attempt to shake our will to fight and shake our government's

Basic national policy. Not long ago, the "Wang-Japan Secret Agreement" was officially exposed to the world, but our nationwide warfare is becoming more and more resolute. The Japanese have exhausted all kinds of schemes and launched various rumor offensives, but our military and civilians have always remained unshaken. On the contrary, countries around the world have become more aware of Japan's ambitions. This is due to the righteousness of our position and the firmness of our will. Therefore, in the initial stage, we were using lone army struggles to contain Japan, but today, our warfare has formed the central force for the joint sanctions of Japan by the Pacific countries. And again, from the internal perspective of Japan, Japan created a "new political system" because of its political bankruptcy and created a new economic system or something because of its economic bankruptcy. However, this method of patching up the cracks and draining the pond to catch the fish cannot alleviate Japan's crisis of collapse, nor can it pass his

The purpose of prolonging the last gasp of breath. Reviewing the past two years, we have finally broken through the last difficult and dangerous environment and established the foundation for victory. This is by no means something that a small number of people can achieve through their efforts. This is entirely due to the common efforts of the military and civilians throughout the country, enduring pain, hardship, and vowing to fight to the death. The achievement of this achievement has involved the fresh blood of many martyrs, the sacrifice of many loyal and brave people, countless touching historical facts, and the practical contributions of countless unsung heroes and people of lofty ideals who have buried their heads and worked hard. As the commander, I can only be extremely inspired and look forward to reporting to my countrymen in one out of ten thousand. What I want to ask everyone to pay attention to now is that the failure of the Japanese has already been decided. The general situation is very beneficial to our country's warfare, but we must make plans for the most difficult warfare and the most dangerous preparations. We must not only be more cautious and more diligent as

Victory approaches, but also have a new understanding of the current world situation. My personal observations on the current situation and my beliefs about the future of the country: After the outbreak of the European War, the war disaster for mankind has an increasing crisis. In the process of the European War, the progress of world tactics and weapons, as well as the successive falls of many small and large countries, have shocked the entire world, especially every country must thoroughly realize that if they do not rise up and catch up and engage in the struggle for survival, there will be no room for independence and freedom. This deep and broad thinking of national struggle is only in its initial stage at present. We firmly believe that the general trend of the world must conform to the traditional beliefs of our nation and must be conducive to our country's resistance and construction. However, we must recognize that if a country does not have

The full determination and strength to defend itself will never survive in this fighting world. In East Asia, the Japanese, because of their failure to invade China, want to complete their aggressive dream, advancing southward at every step. However, this is just a means, and destroying China is actually their goal. Moreover, at the beginning of their advance southward, they will definitely launch a final offensive against us. Therefore, the invasion of China and the advance southward are one thing, not two things. The Japanese so-called "New Order in Greater East Asia" and "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" are even greater insults to our country and the entire East Asia. Why put a "Greater" on the "New Order in East Asia"? The meaning is nothing more than to seize the vast resources and territories of Southeast Asia to enhance its aggressive power, completely block China, and weaken our combat power in order to finally realize its dream of dominating the Pacific and destroying China. As you all know, Southeast Asia is not only where more than 1.2 million of our overseas Chinese

The second homeland where they live and thrive is also where the safety and survival of our nation lie. The Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia is undoubtedly the greatest threat to China's survival and national defense security. We must recognize that although the Japanese have already failed, they have no intention of regretting their mistakes. Moreover, because of the outbreak of the European War, they have become more greedy and妄想to speculate in order to achieve their goals. We must not only resolutely fight to the end to safeguard the independence and survival of our country, but also use our strength to break the deadlock in the world and East Asia caused by the Japanese consortium, especially the last stage of the survival of both China and Japan.

Editorial

### German Troops Enter Bulgaria

The next act of dramatic evolution in the European situation is about to unfold, and we are now at its eve. During the recent two weeks before this eve, Bulgaria has appeared as the protagonist. On March 17th, it signed a non-aggression treaty with Turkey, and on the first of this month, it joined the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan, seemingly a success of multilateral diplomacy. However, the ensuing developments have proven that it is not the protagonist, but a puppet being manipulated, a stage being commandeered. Bulgaria only declared its independence in 1908, and only gained international recognition in the following year, a mere thirty-three years ago. On the 2nd of this month, the Bulgarian government and the public were preparing to celebrate the next day's Independence Day, but as a result of joining the Axis powers the day before, German troops, in the guise of an ally protecting Bulgaria from British attacks, and with the consent of the Bulgarian government as a basis, marched mightily and unimpeded into Bulgarian territory. Yesterday's dispatch estimated that the total number of German land and air forces entering Bulgaria had reached 500,000, immediately occupying the entirety of Bulgaria. According to German claims, the people cheered and welcomed the German troops upon their entry. The Bulgarian Prime Minister also addressed the Parliament, stating: "Although Bulgaria has allowed German troops to enter the country, it will still fulfill its treaty obligations, will not change its peaceful policies, will not launch any attacks, and will not threaten the interests of other countries. The German troops will remain in Bulgaria for a limited period, with the aim of maintaining peace and order, and will also consider Bulgaria's treaty obligations to its neighbors, so as not to cause Bulgaria to engage in any behavior that violates these obligations." The Parliament approved this by a majority vote. This is an extremely brief scene on the stage, without the sound of cannons, without the light of fire, without bloodshed, but it can also be regarded as a one-act tragedy of swallowing blood and tears and putting on a forced smile.

Although the dramatic changes in the European situation are about to unfold, it is still difficult to predict how Mr. Hitler will direct the next act on this eve. Judging by Italy's intentions, after conquering Bulgaria, it will conquer Yugoslavia; then it will give Greece a set of civility before resorting to force, or simply omit this set and launch a large-scale bloody battle in that direction, hoping to defeat Britain and Greece, and urgently seek to save his partner Italy, and complete his long-proclaimed spring offensive; this is the most imaginable trend, but it is only one of the possible directions, and it cannot be said to be entirely inevitable. Among them, Yugoslavia, which is now trapped in a large encirclement, can be said to have already been destined for such a fate, following in Bulgaria's footsteps, or even getting worse.

Mr. Hitler has initiated everything, but how can he dominate everything! If he were in charge, then the Union Jack would have been hoisted over Buckingham Palace in London last autumn, and the Roman Empire would have been established in Africa last winter. As for what he initiated, one cannot but admire his careful consideration and decisive actions. From the German troops' entry into Bulgaria, it can be seen that the signing of the non-aggression treaty between Turkey and Bulgaria was a very important diplomatic pre-arrangement for him, so as to avoid stimulating Turkey when coercing Bulgaria to join the Axis and Bulgaria tolerating the entry of German troops, forcing Turkey to fight alongside Britain. From the large number and speed of the German troops entering Bulgaria, it can be seen that the previous control of Romania was not entirely for the Romanian oil mines, and its goal was very far. Therefore, yesterday's news reported that only 6,000 German troops remained in Romania. Proving the above, in the Bulgarian Prime Minister's speech on maintaining peaceful policies and fulfilling obligations, on the one hand, it indicates the nature of this evolution, although it allows German troops to pass through, it is not to follow Germany in the war, which is exactly in line with the "benevolent neutrality" in Nazi philosophy; on the other hand, it stabilized Turkey with treaty obligations, so that it would not form opposition or even confrontation with the German troops entering Bulgaria due to other obligations. These are all obtained from the surface. It is very likely that there are other tacit understandings behind it. The fundamental reason and method for Germany's rapid advance in the Balkans could not have allowed the Soviet Union and Turkey to remain indifferent and unworried and dangerous; however, the fact that only 6,000 German troops remain in Romania may be regarded as a tacit understanding between Germany and the Soviet Union, that Germany will never threaten the lower reaches of the Danube River controlled by the Soviet Union through Romania, and the Bulgarian Prime Minister's guarantee that the German troops will remain in Bulgaria for a limited period may be regarded as a tacit understanding between Germany and Turkey that Germany will never threaten the Dardanelles Strait controlled by Turkey through Bulgaria. What the Soviet Union and Turkey are most concerned about is the lower reaches of the Danube and the Dardanelles Strait, and if these are always in their control, they will also shield the safety of the entire Black Sea.

All of the above are initiated by Mr. Hitler. To push its trend back, we have to see how Britain, on the other hand, will fight? The past and future in between are difficult to understand clearly; just as British Foreign Secretary Eden and Chief of Staff General Dill recently visited Turkey, they certainly had a major mission, and now they have left Turkey happily. What concrete achievements have been made, and how can Britain and Turkey cooperate? Just as Britain and Greece and Germany and Italy will soon have a nearly decisive battle, what will be the gains and losses? These are all impossible to predict, and what is even more unknown is what kind of joy and separation the interests of Turkey have permeated between Britain and the Soviet Union? Judging from general reasoning, even if the Soviet Union and Germany have any tacit understanding, or there is a direct tacit understanding between Germany and Turkey, or an indirect tacit understanding with the Soviet Union intervening, at most they will tolerate it temporarily; playing with soldiers is like playing with fire, and there will be a day when the flames cannot be controlled and will spread. Moreover, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany, whether thick or thin, friendly or hostile, is bound to be inversely proportional to the German momentum; therefore, all dramatic changes are coming!

### Prelude to the German Spring Offensive: Complete Control of Bulgaria; German Vanguard Nears Greece; Bulgarian Government Decides to Temporarily Close Borders

Berlin: The German High Command issued a communiqué last night, stating roughly that the German High Command is aware of British intentions in Southeastern Europe, and has taken precautionary measures, entering Bulgaria with the permission of the Bulgarian government. The German army was warmly welcomed by the Bulgarian people. (Naval Agency Urgent Dispatch, 3rd)

Berlin: Sources familiar with the matter claim that the German entry into Bulgaria is aimed at protecting Bulgarian interests and thwarting British attempts to wage war there. Political circles say Bulgaria's accession to the Axis is a military victory for Germany, and that other countries will soon follow, implying Yugoslavia. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

Sofia: Several vehicles transported German troops to Sofia last night, where they were warmly welcomed by the public. German aircraft also circled in the air. Foreign newspapers' reports that Sofia is in a "state of military emergency" do not match the facts. The arrival of German troops in Sofia merely adds new meaning to a state of peace. (Haitong Dispatch, 3rd)

Sofia: Today is Bulgaria's Independence Day. While German troops successively entered Bulgarian territory yesterday, Bulgaria began its commemorative celebrations. Sofia is very quiet. Yesterday was Sunday, and the main streets were still bustling with people. All public institutions hung national flags to celebrate, with some also displaying swastika flags, indicating to the public that Bulgaria has signed the Axis Pact. However, this did not arouse much interest among the Bulgarian people at this time. Armed German soldiers began appearing in Sofia on Saturday afternoon. Many officers arrived successively yesterday. However, there are currently not many German soldiers in Sofia. Shortly after noon, key personnel from the German General Staff arrived in cars, escorted by motorcycle soldiers wearing steel helmets and military trucks. The officers carried maps and were mostly in military uniform, with some wearing civilian clothes. According to Axis sources, Germany has announced its intention to occupy Bulgaria on Tuesday. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)

Sofia: Reliable sources say German vanguard troops have approached the Greek border. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

London: According to recent reports from Sofia, the main movements of German troops appear to be southward and southwestward, aiming for the Greek border and the Rhodope Mountain passes. It is reported that the German army crossed the Danube River from Romania via pontoon bridges to enter Bulgaria. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)

Berlin: Berlin's Essen National Daily News commented on the German entry into Bulgaria this morning, stating roughly that this move can dispel foreign press speculation about Bulgaria's accession. The German entry into Bulgaria demonstrates the spirit of diplomatic and military cooperation among the Axis powers. Berlin is closely watching British activities in the Mediterranean, but their behavior is risky. Bulgaria's accession to the Tripartite Pact can be seen as a prelude to the German spring offensive, and the best guarantee for Bulgaria's existence. The impact of Bulgaria's accession will be to extend this peaceful policy to other regions. German troops will guarantee Bulgaria's security. Churchill's threat to Bulgaria a few weeks ago will not materialize. The final battle is about to begin. The curtain has not yet been raised, but the combatants have entered their positions. (Haitong Dispatch, 3rd)

Berlin: The German News Agency recently issued a telegram from the Bulgarian capital stating that the Bulgarian government has decided to temporarily close the border. (Havas Dispatch, 3rd)

Bulgarian King Receives British Envoy: Severance of Relations Only a Matter of Time

Sofia: Bulgarian King Boris received British Envoy Rendel yesterday for ninety minutes. The British envoy declined to reveal the content of the audience. However, the British side indicated that Rendel considered the situation extremely serious, and that the severance of diplomatic relations between Britain and Bulgaria is only a matter of days or hours, and is currently awaiting instructions from London. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

Sofia: According to highly reliable sources, the Bulgarian King did not encourage the British envoy to stay. The severance of relations between the two countries is likely to be announced on Wednesday or Thursday this week, and the British envoy is expected to leave Bulgaria next weekend. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)

London: The British government has not yet decided whether to maintain or sever relations with Bulgaria after its accession to the Axis. The ambassador to Bulgaria, Rendel, has been authorized to act at his discretion. (Havas Dispatch, 3rd)

Vichy: A telegram from Bulgaria received here states that the British military attaché in Bulgaria has left Sofia. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)

Stockholm: According to reports from London last night, telephone and telegraph communications between London and Bulgaria, except those used by diplomatic circles, have been interrupted. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 3rd)

London: This morning, British newspapers commented on the weekend's developments in Bulgaria, with the following key points: (1) Warning Bulgaria must bear the consequences of tolerating German occupation; (2) Sympathy for the people of Bulgaria; (3) Britain is prepared for all events in the Balkans. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)

Yugoslavia Feels Threatened: Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Confer on Political Situation

Belgrade: The Yugoslav Prime Minister suddenly returned to the capital from his country villa yesterday afternoon and conferred with Foreign Minister Marković on the political situation. Marković had just returned to the capital from Vienna this morning. The two then went to see Regent Prince Paul together. The official announcement of the contents of the meeting is pending. (Haitong Dispatch, 2nd)

Belgrade: Reliable sources said yesterday that the smooth entry of German troops into Bulgaria has brought Yugoslavia closer to the Axis. It also said that the German occupation of Bulgaria has greatly changed the situation in the Balkans, including the early end of the Greek-Italian war and leaving Yugoslavia surrounded by Axis countries. Under these circumstances, Yugoslavia must reconsider its policies and can no longer take a close watch and reserve freedom of action. Reliable sources said that close proximity to the Axis would put the country at risk of military surveys to determine territorial boundaries. It is widely believed that Bulgaria will benefit the most because Bulgaria first leaned towards the Axis. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

London: The News Chronicle says German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is preparing to ask Yugoslavia to mediate the Greek-Italian war immediately. If Greece refuses, German troops may advance from Bulgaria and Yugoslavia simultaneously to the Greek border. (International Dispatch, 3rd)

Washington: Military circles here announced today that if Yugoslavia joins the Axis, Germany will have more power to make demands on Greece than it does now with its occupation of Bulgaria. Military officials pointed out that Yugoslavia could provide German mechanized units with an easy route into Greece, better than Bulgaria, and avoid the risk of a Turkish flank attack. The Vardar River valley in Yugoslavia has a railway that runs directly to Greece. However, if Germany attacks Greece from Bulgaria, German troops must cross mountainous terrain. Furthermore, if Greece is attacked from Yugoslavia, a large number of troops can be transferred to Bulgaria to protect the flanks of the attacking forces. However, informed sources said that if Britain could or would send sufficient troops to Greece, it could offer serious resistance to the Nazis. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

Soviet Union's Current Policy Unchanged: Willing to Improve Relations with Britain and the United States

Ankara: Diplomatic circles here say that the Soviet Union cannot ignore Germany's occupation of Bulgaria, but is currently unable to take any action. At the same time, due to the gradual progress of its military and economic position, the Soviet Union is willing to improve relations with Britain and the United States. Diplomatic circles believe that the Soviet Union is willing to obtain British recognition of its annexed territories in exchange for an economic agreement with Britain. The Soviet Union has also adopted a friendly attitude towards Turkey and will provide assistance if Turkey goes to war with Germany. All of these points were key points in the recent British-Turkish-Soviet talks. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps has gone to Istanbul en route to Moscow. Before leaving Ankara, he met with the Soviet Ambassador here. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

Vichy: After Bulgaria joined the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, diplomatic observers here recently said that the Soviet Union would not react to this. According to reports from Moscow, Soviet officials are currently maintaining silence. However, observing the diplomatic activities of the Soviet government in the past few months, it can be seen that the Soviet Union does not want to abandon its interests in the Balkan Peninsula, especially in areas inhabited by Slavic peoples. As for the Soviet Union's current policy, up to now, it has proven to be of great benefit to the country itself, and there is no reason to change course for the time being. (Havas Dispatch, 2nd)

### More Than 100 Japanese Warships Sail South Through Fujian

Fuzhou: A large fleet of Japanese warships, totaling more than 100 ships, has sailed into Fujian waters in the past two days. According to foreign sources, this is a sign of the Japanese navy launching a southward advance. Some of the Japanese warships sailed south yesterday afternoon, possibly heading towards the Pacific Ocean. (Dispatch from 4:30 AM, 3rd)

### Chinese Side Denies: Chinese Troops Enter Burma

Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman today criticized Japanese reports that 20,000 Chinese troops had entered the Burma Road, saying that British defenses do not need Chinese assistance. The spokesman said, "Although Burma is governed by Britain, it is still Burma for the Burmese people. How can our troops enter Burma without the permission of China and Burma? The British authorities have repeatedly stated that the defenses of China, Burma, and Malaya have been strengthened, so in fact, we do not need to provide assistance." (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

### Hunan Military Service Inspection Group Departs for Inspection

Leiyang: The Hunan Military District Headquarters, in order to expand propaganda for national military service and rectify military administration, has expanded the military service inspection group into twelve groups, divided into four districts, to go to counties throughout the province in rotation for inspection.

Hong Kong: According to reports from Chongqing, the Chinese government has appointed Dr. Harry Baker, head of the Far East Red Cross, as Director-General of the Yunnan-Burma Road to improve the efficiency of the exchange of goods between the United States and China. (International News Agency Dispatch, 3rd)

### Missionary Dies in Car Accident on Yunnan-Burma Road

Chongqing: The funeral of 30-year-old American woman, Miss Kiss, who died on the Yunnan-Burma Road last Thursday, is being arranged pending notification of her relatives in the United States.

The authorities are willing to transport the body to Kunming for burial. Miss Kiss had been teaching at Jinling University in Chongqing for two years but had recently resigned to work at the American Red Cross office in Lashio. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

### Soviet Ambassador's Wife Arrives in Chongqing

Chongqing: The wife of the Soviet Ambassador to China arrived here by plane on Saturday from Moscow. The Ambassador's wife had been away from Chongqing for six months. Soviet sources here said that the Ambassador's health is still poor and that he did not receive guests last week. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

### Packages Detained in Vietnam Have Been Released

Chongqing: It was reported today that Chinese and French authorities recently agreed to send long-detained Chinese packages in Vietnam to the recipients. There are currently 30,000 packages stored in Haiphong, 300 of which will be transported to China this week. (United Press Dispatch, 2nd)

### Vichy Accepts Mediation Terms: Cedes Fertile Land to Thailand; Japan Takes Advantage to Win Thai Favor; Leaves Room for Attacking Malaya

Vichy: Reliable sources announced that France is unwilling to wage a hopeless war against Japan, and would rather cede the most fertile land in Vietnam to Thailand. The Cabinet has passed the terms of Japan's second mediation, in fact because France knows that it cannot resist Japan's military force. This time, France's surrender involves five provinces, namely Luang Prabang in Laos, and all of Pakse (west bank of the Mekong River), Siem Reap, and the northwest Cambodian provinces of Battambang and Kampong Thom. Thailand will thus obtain rich rubber plantations, minerals, and vast rice fields near the Tonle Sap Lake, which can greatly increase Siam's rice production, while rubber and tin are the main points of Thailand's demands. It is rumored that all of Thailand's rubber and tin must be shipped to Japan first. France is actually accepting all the terms, but nominally only yields to Japan's military intimidation and accepts Japan's mediation rather than directly surrendering to Thailand. This decision was made after receiving Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's final warning. At the same time, French cabinet ministers were informed that Japan had stockpiled a large amount of military supplies in Thailand, far more than the Thai army could use. Observers believe that this is to use the Mekong River war to stockpile military supplies, which will definitely be used to attack Singapore in the future. It is also believed that Japan will gain Bangkok's favor without losing a soldier or spending a bullet. By indulging Thailand, it will not only gain a base for taking Singapore but also drive British interests out of Thailand. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

Saigon: Authorities here said today that they have not yet received official news from Vichy, so they cannot comment on the situation where France is rumored to have accepted Japan's proposal to cede Laos and Cambodia to Thailand. At the same time, the blackout and military preparations continue. Regarding the Vietnamese-Japanese rice agreement, a rice merchant claimed that after Vietnam fulfills its contract, there will be 50,000 tons of rice left over, which the Japanese may request. According to rice merchants, Vietnam has agreed to ship at least 700,000 tons of rice to Japan, 200,000 tons to France, and 125,000 tons to Shanghai in 1941. In addition to this amount, there may be more than 500,000 tons of surplus rice, which will also be shipped to Japan and paid for in Japanese yen. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

Vichy: According to well-informed sources in Vichy, France's response to Japan's proposals regarding the Thai-Vietnamese dispute was submitted to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka yesterday by Ambassador to Japan Henri. Its wording allows negotiations to continue and suggests hope for a peaceful resolution. It can indeed be regarded as a positive response, but there are still some points that France hopes to negotiate further. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 3rd)

Tokyo: Semi-official Japanese sources say that France's reply to Japan's proposals has been received by the Thai and French representatives for the peace talks. The Thai and French representatives are waiting for instructions from their respective countries to hold the fifth meeting. This meeting is likely to be held tomorrow or the day after, before the expiration of the ceasefire. The ceasefire is set to expire on March 7th. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

Bangkok: According to semi-official Japanese sources, Thai officials and the public are maintaining a calm attitude towards the Tokyo peace talks, believing that a good ending can be achieved in the end. According to well-informed observers, whether the meeting will end satisfactorily depends entirely on developments in the next few days. Close attention is being paid to France's actions. Although the talks in Tokyo have avoided a breakdown thanks to France's concessions, it is still too early to say that Thailand and Vietnam can reach a complete compromise, because it is believed that the French representatives in Tokyo have not yet received Vichy's final instructions. According to Japanese sources, well-informed observers said that Thailand's unconditional delegation of mediation rights to Japan shows that Thailand has deep trust in Japan, believing that Japan will do its best to lay the foundation for peace in East Asia. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)

Tokyo: Matsuoka met the Japanese Emperor at 1:20 PM today to report on recent political developments. Informed sources said that Matsuoka's move was related to reports in the foreign press that Vichy had fully accepted Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute. At the same time, the Emperor received General Shunroku Hata, the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force to China. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun recently predicted a "pleasant conclusion" to the French-Thai peace talks mediated by Japan. The newspaper said that both France and Thailand have accepted Japan's mediation proposals. Future meetings will naturally be more frequent so that they can be concluded quickly. French Ambassador Henri has informed Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka that Vichy has accepted Japan's proposals in principle and has requested Japan to mediate further to make Thailand give further concessions to Vietnam. The newspaper also said that French Ambassador Henri is preparing for a major concession because the ceasefire is about to expire. The newspaper also said that Vichy's response still has flexibility. The final decision will depend on the attitude of French Ambassador Henri and former Vietnamese Governor Robin, the chief French representative here. However, the peace talks, which were about to break down, are now sure to continue. In addition, all newspapers in Tokyo believe that Vichy has accepted Japan's proposals, but has asked Japan to find a way to get Thailand to give Vietnam some concessions.

### Soviet Union Increases Agricultural Production Through Scientific Methods

Moscow: According to renowned Soviet scientist Timiryazev, the productivity of the land is unlimited, and if we can use scientific methods, harvests can be increased. In terms of major agricultural products, Soviet harvest records rank first in the world. For example, in wheat, Soviet collective farmers, using the latest scientific methods, can harvest 70 to 100 centners per hectare. In corn, they can harvest 125 centners per hectare. In addition, in rye, a female farmer in the Kursk region, Bagaskayeva, harvests 73.6 tons per hectare, a record that has never been seen in history. Corn yields are 120 centners per hectare, equal to the world record. In cotton, the yield on Soviet irrigated land is two to three times higher than that of Egypt and the United States, averaging from 103 to 150 centners per hectare. At the same time, flax yields are 39.06 centners per hectare, and sugar beets are 1.161 centners per hectare, records so high that no country in the world can match them. Soviet farmers have achieved new successes in all areas of agriculture by using scientific methods. (TASS Dispatch, 3rd)

The public and private activities of overseas French people will be subject to strict control. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 3rd)

### Germany Can Use at Most 100 Submarines in the War Against British Submarines: New Submarine Construction Figures Are Close to Exaggeration: Paper Plans Are Difficult to Achieve as Scheduled

London: The Sunday Times naval correspondent said that it is expected that Hitler will use 100 to 120 submarines to launch a new war against British maritime commerce. However, Hitler can only maintain his attacks with one-third of this number of submarines. The figures for the number of new submarines built by German shipyards are too exaggerated. Some say that there are as many as 600, and some say that there are 1,000. This news is being spread by Berlin and is part of a kind of psychological warfare. In fact, this number is a fantasy, without a doubt, because it is five to ten times more submarines than German shipyards can build in twelve months. Submarines cannot be mass-produced. During construction, there is a lot of work that must be done patiently by skilled workers by hand, and the number of skilled workers is limited, and Germany has no evidence of recruiting additional workers from the ravaged countries. In addition, there is the issue of capacity. The number of docks in Germany that can be used to build ships hundreds of feet long is known to everyone. Even with the use of docks in the occupied countries, it is not enough to build 600 new submarines last year. To be generous, Germany may have drawn up a procedure for building 150 new submarines in recent months, but there is a long distance between design on paper and a new ship at sea. During the last war, the German navy ordered submarines, initially believing that all could be built in time, but in the end only half were built. Therefore, it is expected that Hitler will use 100 to 120 submarines that can actually serve to attack British maritime commerce. This number seems quite daunting at first glance, but in fact, it may not all be active at sea. Germany must have a number of submarines for other purposes, such as the Kiel submarine school needing several submarines to train new submariners as one example. At this time, Germany may be actively training 4,000 submariners. If 1,000 of them practice on submarines for one period of time each, then 20 submarines are needed for this purpose. This is not just a guess, because in 1917, when the Great War was in full swing, Germany did allocate 20 submarines for practice. The submarines used by Germany cannot all be sent to sea to fight at all times. According to practical experience, only one-third of all submarines can serve in active service, half are resting, and half are undergoing major repairs, changing every week. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)

### Eden and Others Arrive in Athens, British and Greek Officials Hold Talks, Turkey Plants Mines in the Dardanelles to Prevent Changes in the Situation in Southeast Europe

Athens - British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Imperial General Staff Chief General Dill arrived here yesterday after talks in Turkey and went to the British Embassy. British Ambassador Palairet and Greek Prime Minister Koryzis welcomed them at the embassy. Last night, King George of Greece met with Eden. Among those who came to Greece with the two men were British Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff Air Vice-Marshal Peirse, British Army Brigadier Marrape, and several officials from the Foreign Office. They will stay in Greece for several days. Eden told reporters that he was very pleased with his trip to Turkey. The Greek Prime Minister will formally host a banquet for Eden today. (Reuters, March 3rd)

Athens - Eden and his entourage arrived here by plane at 2:45 p.m. yesterday. After meeting with King George II of Greece, they held talks with the Greek Prime Minister. Upon Eden's arrival, the authorities took meticulous steps to protect him. Whirlwind reconnaissance planes circled in the air near and far above Athens, but no enemy aircraft appeared. Eden's plane was closely guarded by fighter planes. (Associated Press, March 3rd)

Athens - The talks between British Foreign Secretary Eden and the Greek authorities began last night and lasted until after midnight. They continued this afternoon. General Dill was present at the meeting. (Reuters, March 3rd)

London - The Times' diplomatic correspondent stated that Germany's threat to Greece has made rapid progress over the weekend. Germany's control of Bulgaria has been completed. If the German leaders do not have a conspiracy to use that country as a base for operations against Greece, they may try new threats, hoping to achieve results through intimidation and trickery. Or they may organize bombing in the future and attempt to cross the border from Bulgaria to the Aegean coast. At this point, it is also clear that British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Imperial General Staff Chief General Dill visited Turkey at the right time. Last Thursday, when the threat to the Aegean Sea was imminent, Britain and Turkey quickly reached a complete compromise on all war issues. Although the details are not yet known, it is clear that this compromise is a new foundation for the cooperation between the allied countries and Greece to develop to the greatest possible extent. (Reuters, March 3rd)

Istanbul - The Turkish Naval Department has notified foreign shipping authorities that all ships wishing to pass through the Dardanelles Strait must notify them in advance and request port instructions for the route, as mines have been laid at the entrance to the strait. In addition, Turkey has adopted standard bread. It is said that the Turkish government has taken this measure due to the uncertain situation in Southeast Europe. (Haitong News Agency, March 3rd)

Istanbul - Turkey began deploying warships on both sides of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits today and has laid mines in various waterways. Turkish warships have removed their gun covers and set sail from Istanbul and other naval bases to patrol the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits. It is reported that German troops have occupied several Bulgarian airfields. It only takes a few minutes to fly from these airfields to the Dardanelles. It is believed that Turkey's move is the result of consultations between British Foreign Secretary Eden and the Turkish authorities. In this meeting, a joint action plan may have been drawn up. (International News Agency, March 3rd)

London - Turkey remains calm about the entry of German troops into Bulgaria. Currently, at least a small team of German troops has arrived in the Bulgarian town of Sidirokastro, a few miles from the Turkish border. Responsible persons said that Turkey has taken complete defensive precautions, but officials remain silent on the issue of mobilization. (Reuters, March 3rd)

Turkish Capital - Diplomatic sources here said that as far as the Axis powers are concerned, Bulgaria's accession to the Tripartite Pact is only a "purely imaginary victory." The main purpose of the Vienna Conference was to counteract the effect of British Foreign Secretary Eden's talks in the Turkish capital. But in any case, it can be asserted that Turkey will maintain its territorial integrity within the scope of the alliance with Britain. (Havas News Agency, February 2nd)

### Bulgarian Prime Minister Attends Parliament

Bulgarian Capital - Prime Minister Filov attended the Senate and House of Representatives today and gave a speech, stating, "The recent developments in the political situation in Europe and the Balkans have created a situation that we must take into account. We are forced to do so and must take certain decisions to protect the interests of our nation. The government is deeply aware of the great responsibility it bears, and has therefore reviewed the situation and taken various measures to benefit our country, but without making the slightest change to our basic policy of loving peace and abiding by the treaties we have concluded with neighboring countries. What is this decision? It is that our country joins the Tripartite Pact and allows German troops to enter our country. During the negotiations in Vienna, the German government requested our permission to allow German troops to enter our country, while also explaining in detail that this move by the German troops is of a temporary nature and that its motivation is entirely out of a desire to maintain peace in the Balkans. On the contrary, Germany has been fully aware of and has examined our country's treaties with its neighboring countries and the non-aggression pact concluded with Turkey. Under these circumstances, in order to take into account the friendship between Germany and Bulgaria, we decided to accept Germany's proposal and allow its troops to enter our country after obtaining Germany's guarantee to fully respect our country's laws, order, and protect our country's interests. Our government must hereby declare that the entry of German troops into Bulgaria will in no way change our country's peaceful policies. We will continue to adhere to our treaty obligations. Our determination to avoid taking any aggressive actions and to avoid endangering the interests of other countries will be consistent from beginning to end. In short, our government believes that the decision taken at present is not only of great benefit to our country's own interests and future under the current situation, but also makes a great contribution to peace in the Balkans. Our government hopes that this attitude will be understood by those who observe the facts with an objective eye." After Filov finished his speech, eighteen opposition members jointly requested a discussion of the protocol signed when Bulgaria joined the Tripartite Pact. This motion will be discussed by the Senate and House of Representatives. (Havas News Agency, February 2nd)

Bulgarian Capital - Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov read a memorandum from the German government to Parliament yesterday afternoon, stating that the German government requested the Bulgarian government to allow German troops to enter Bulgaria. At the same time, the German government declared that the German troops' mission was to maintain peace and order in the Balkans and that it was of a limited duration. The Bulgarian government's reply stated that the German government's request did not violate Bulgaria's peaceful policies or Bulgaria's treaty obligations to its neighboring countries. The German government had indeed considered Bulgaria's various friendship treaties and the treaty recently signed with Turkey. (Haitong News Agency, March 3rd)

London - According to the Daily Telegraph, armed crowds and communists are now opposing the German occupation of Bulgaria. It is reported that fierce clashes have occurred in several places in the Bulgarian capital yesterday. (International News Agency, March 3rd)

It is expected that today's debate in the Senate will focus on the actions of German troops. Political circles believe that the White House will use this matter to expedite the passage of the Lend-Lease Act. It is expected that supporters of President Roosevelt in the Senate will ensure that the Lend-Lease Act is passed this week. (Haitong News Agency, March 3rd)

### U.S. Government to Announce Freezing of Bulgarian Deposits

Washington - The U.S. State Department is about to announce the freezing of Bulgarian deposits, but this measure has no practical value. Bulgaria's deposits in the United States are estimated to be slightly less than 500,000 U.S. dollars. (Haitong News Agency, March 3rd)

### British Forces Occupy Important Mountain Passes North of Keren, 1,000 Italian Soldiers Surrender in Libya, Rome Denies Armistice with Greece

Cairo - British forces have occupied an important mountain pass twenty miles north of Keren. Keren is a strong Italian stronghold in the mountains and is the military key to the British conquest of the entire Eritrean colony. According to a military spokesman who told a Reuters reporter, the British forces won this victory after guerrilla-style fierce battles and occupied this strategically important position. This will have an impact on the offensive on Keren. According to a communiqué issued by the British General Headquarters, a column of British forces advancing from the north occupied this mountain pass. The main force of this column set off from Keremete and made contact with the Italian army in the narrow valley north of Keren on Saturday. The military operations in the entire Italian Somaliland have also made satisfactory progress. However, the British forces advancing towards Gondar in Abyssinia have slowed down due to the rugged terrain.

### Random Notes on the European War (30) (8): On the Eve of the Spring Offensive: A Perspective on Germany's Strength

Hitler recently gave a speech at the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Nazi Party, in which he said, "I feel stronger now than before, because spring is coming, and this is another time to measure our strength." So, to what extent is Germany's strength at this time? The following is a translation of a report from the Berlin correspondent of the American Christian Science Monitor:

After achieving the greatest military victory on the European continent, Germany, like King Tantalus in Greek mythology, although it has won every battle on the battlefield, still has to prepare for the greatest effort to obtain the fruit of victory that is still swaying uncertainly, within reach but not quite graspable.

Looking back at history, the German army's blitzkrieg-like operations are indeed rare in ancient and modern times, but it is also rare that Germany has repeatedly had its dreams close to realization, but victory is still illusory!

However, the German military authorities and the suffering and submissive people do not allow their beliefs to waver because of doubts about the final victory. Germany has the best-trained army in history, which has never been defeated, and has never been stopped in the astonishing campaigns of the past year. But its final victory still leaves some temptations, which seem to be snatched away at the last moment, seemingly within reach, but ultimately as illusory as a reflection in the water.

Since the beginning of the new year, the German army is moving again. They are once again trying to take advantage of the momentum to obtain the reward that Germany and the German people have been expecting for eight years of frugality, hard work, and sweat. Their reward is not easily taken away. Their offensive power, at least in the land and air, is now even greater than before. The weapons they used to attack France last spring have been tempered by experience and victory, plus the enlistment of new recruits and the round-the-clock rush manufacturing of munitions for six or seven months, which has increased their weight.

Wherever this large army advances, it has terrible power and is extremely large. It can attack on several fronts at the same time. It is undoubtedly deployed on the west coast of Europe and can be used to attack the powerful Britain. It apparently has even greater forces moving towards British territories in the Mediterranean. In addition, it has a large number of troops standing by to ensure the security of the German-Soviet friendship treaty. Any military possibility is within the meticulous calculations of the German Supreme Command.

Among these possibilities, German strategists have chosen what they believe is the most suitable place to break British resistance and achieve final victory, so that the Nazi Party can control Europe and Africa and maintain a world hegemony unmatched since the ancient Roman Empire.

However, while 1940 has brought the ancient Germanic dream of conquest closer to realization, it has also revealed the punishment they must suffer if they fail. Before the German offensive was launched last year, the internal affairs of other European countries were strongly attracted by its European new order concept. Even after the German army invaded these countries, there was still a strong movement to accept conquest and cooperate with Germany. However, in recent months, this tolerance has changed to suspicion, fear, resistance, and hatred.

With the advance of the victorious army, a dramatic change has taken place in people and ideas wherever it has passed, and the seeds of resentment have actually been sown.

Germany is almost unprecedentedly isolated today. The sentiment that hopes for its ultimate defeat has spread from the areas under its control to the entire world. If its army once hesitates and retreats, Germany will reap the evil consequences it has sown. The more territory the German army conquers, the greater the need for victory increases. Because Germany knows this, it has to keep moving forward, silencing the steady elements at home, and increasing the voice of the ambitious and boundless elements.

For a year, Germany's military equipment has not been exhausted due to the rapid military victories. The consumption of food and raw materials can be mostly compensated by war booty. The food eaten by the German people today is almost the same as last winter. The German authorities have said that if there is a serious famine, the first to suffer will never be the Germans. However, many changes have taken place within Germany, indicating that if the war is prolonged indefinitely, there will inevitably be concerns about famine.

Germany's ration system is constantly expanding its scope, including more items. Household goods, either necessary for daily life or purchased to prevent inflation, have become increasingly scarce. Price controls have failed to prevent prices from rising, and clothing costs have almost doubled. The prices and quantities of staple foods remain roughly the same as before, but extra foods such as nuts, raisins, chocolate, and fruit are extremely scarce. The average allocation of food was originally the most reasonable goal of rationing, but it has gradually been rejected by various bad habits.

A black market already exists in Germany. Coffee is thirty marks a pound, and tea is forty or fifty marks a pound. If you know where they are sold, you can easily buy them. When it comes to the problem of household supplies, you can often hear the word "contact." There is also a common term, which is "under the counter." People who have regular dealings with shops can secretly receive and give each other to get extra delicacies.

None of the above indicates that Germany is feeling real shortages. People on the street still look healthy and do not show signs of malnutrition. But these small things are enough to make informed people think that things will be different in two or three years. The decline in the standard of living is gradual rather than sudden. It is certainly not easy to see as one month passes after another, but it is declining all year round!

For a year, German morale has been maintained at a high level. In fact, the current morale is higher than at this time last year.

At the end of 1939, apart from the military victory in Poland, there was nothing to show to make the German people believe in the superiority of their army's strength. Since the easy victory over France, all the doubts during the first few months of the war have been swept away. Their record of this victory is greatly comforting to the people. However, along with the issue of morale comes the question of what will happen in the event of a war failure. This fear has also been growing secretly.

As a result of fearing people's hatred, most Germans, regardless of their feelings for National Socialism, support victoryism. As long as they can foresee victory, they can be expected to support the war to the end. Only by destroying their belief in victory will German morale be seriously affected.

But on the other hand, if their expected final victory is severely hit, the magnitude of the reaction can be easily imagined. Morale is built on a combined foundation of expecting victory and fearing failure, rather than on the legitimacy of fundamental belief, and its lack of lasting enthusiasm is already evident.

The gradual emergence of the American threat has gradually made the German people uneasy. This is another factor that is forcing their military policy to tend towards new efforts in order to achieve the dreamed-of victory as soon as possible. But because of news control, the German people still only have a vague image of this threat and cannot know the details of the American trend. Ordinary people only know that American aid to Britain is limited to what is paid for by British money. They still believe that America is completely materialistic.

What can seriously hit German morale is that American aid to Britain is not only for profit. This truth

### Finance: Demand for Foreign Exchange Increases Again

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no change in HSBC's listed prices. In the black market for British and American exchange rates, speculators suddenly tended to buy due to the calming environment and foreign banks' supply was less than demand, the market shrank. The spot transaction price of the US dollar in the morning reached 5.9375 from 5.625, but the market has softened to 5.53125. The demand for March is particularly strong, and the closing price has been announced at 5.5 yuan. The shilling saw minimal shrinkage because very few transactions were opened, and the evening closing was 3/4 of a penny 40625, which compared to last Saturday's closing price, British exchange shrunk 0.015625 and American exchange tightened 0.09375.

Foreign Banks' Demand Exceeds Supply

At the beginning of the morning, exchange rates were flat for British to US, Shanghai, etc., US to British fell 0.25, and demand for Shanghai was even greater. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened spot selling prices in the morning at 3/4 of a penny 421875 for British gold and 5.59375 yuan for the US dollar. Compared with the closing price at the end of last week, British gold was stable and the US dollar tightened 0.03125. After opening, the US bank sold shillings, and the price was relatively loose and cheap. It is estimated that Huaxing absorbed spot prices at 3/4 of a penny 4375. Later, Hong Kong telegraphed about the March US dollar, and the market was still flat. It is estimated that the foreign bank sold it for 5.59375 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were announced to be unchanged. Thereafter, the Japanese bank wanted to plug in the spot US dollar and sold it to Youli and a certain American bank at a price of 5.625 yuan. Up to this month, the US dollar has seen a slight increase due to the good appetite of foreign banks. Hua merchants and speculators spit out still at 5.59375 yuan. Near noon, there was a gradual feeling that the supply was less than the demand, and the market tended to tighten.

British and American Futures and Spot Prices Tighten Together

In the aftermarket, speculators came to report that demand for the March US dollar increased. It is estimated that foreign banks sold it for 5.5625 to 5.53125 yuan. Subsequently, the potential slightly recovered as Japanese banks and speculators spit it out. The March US dollar was announced at 5.5625 yuan. As a result of the evening closing, the market tightened again. The spot and this month's British exchange rates were both 3/4 of a penny 40625. The spot US dollar was 5.53125 yuan, and this month it was announced at 5.5 yuan. Compared with last Saturday's closing price, British exchange futures and spot prices each shrunk 0.015625, and the US dollar tightened 0.09375.

### Interrupted Bearish News; Gold Prices Soar

Yesterday, spot gold dark market and bullish forces were more active, as bearish news in the market was interrupted, and people's hearts were glued. Generally, operators tended to buy in, and the public followed suit. Except for a slight pullback after the morning opening, it rose to 6,300 yuan later. Xianghe, Mian Tong, Kangyong, and Dafeng, among others, bought the most. Retail investors and floating bulls occasionally took profits, so the upward momentum was still slow. Tight foreign exchange was also a major factor encouraging buyers. The closing price in the evening was 6,296 yuan, a large increase of 133 yuan compared to the closing price at the end of last week. The price after closing was 6,302 yuan. The spot market remains strong. The morning opening was 585 yuan higher than the futures market, and 550 yuan higher in the afternoon. Gold ornaments were 10 yuan higher in the afternoon, reaching 700 yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.

Increased by More Than 130 Yuan

In the early morning, people's hearts were firm, and prices outside the market were also high after the close of last week. Sellers held back at the opening, resulting in a price of 6,210 yuan. Before long, Dafeng and another major player sought to increase prices, rising to 6,230 yuan. However, Hengji and Chengji took advantage of the high prices to sell off, and Dafeng and the other major player also successively reduced their positions, causing a retreat to within the 6,200 yuan mark, reporting 6,180 yuan. However, because of the strong buying interest from Tong Kangyong, Xianghe, and Xiangxingyong, and a slight softening of foreign exchange, the underlying trend was upward, hovering around 6,218 yuan. Near noon, the pulling force from retail investors was also strong. Although there was profit-taking by floating bulls, the closing price steadily reported 6,315 yuan. The market opened higher in the afternoon, at 6,230 yuan. It briefly decreased by 5 yuan, to 6,225 yuan. However, Hengji, Hesheng, Xianghe, Chengji, and others jointly purchased, and news of tighter foreign exchange further stimulated buying, first rising to 6,290 yuan. At this time, retail investors and Yifeng were willing to sell, falling back to 6,260 yuan. Ultimately, due to the softening of foreign exchange, and with Deda and the other major player both entering the market, prices were raised again to 6,300 yuan. Extending to the evening close, there was still 6,296 yuan, and after the close, prices outside the market had reached 6,300 yuan, or 6,302 yuan. This was an increase of 133 yuan compared to the closing price at the end of last week. The fluctuation range for the entire day was 120 yuan. The selling price of spot gold from cash houses was more than 10 yuan higher than spot gold, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no market for spot gold.

Ornamental Gold Also Increased by 10 Yuan

The selling price of silver ornaments per tael remained unchanged in the morning. At 3:50 PM, it increased by 10 yuan. Major firms changed their prices to 700 yuan, while new firms offered similar prices. The purchase price was 40 yuan lower, it was said.

### US Dollars to 18 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a sharp rise in spot prices. British and US gold pounds each rose by 3 yuan. British gold notes remained stagnant, with market prices remaining flat. US dollar notes suddenly surged to 18 yuan, an increase of 22 cents compared to the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong notes was not scarce, and the market only saw a slight increase. Japanese gold notes continued to rise to 1.80 yuan. Korean notes slightly softened, falling back to 1.465 yuan in the evening market.

### Grains: Futures and Spot Rice Vanish Entirely

Since the foreign rice market presented a complete absence the week before, yesterday's opening was even worse. Not only were there no samples for spot goods, but futures also lacked openings. The only item for sale on the market was Hong Kong glutinous rice. However, glutinous rice reserves were insufficient, causing market prices to soar by a huge 2-3 yuan as all parties searched for supplies. Hong Kong special round-grain rice opened at 93 yuan, followed by long-grain rice at 90 yuan. This situation is truly indescribable.

Domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica varieties also saw prices rise due to the poor state of foreign rice. Therefore, regardless of thick or thin japonica, prices continued to increase by 1 yuan. Changbang original white japonica was quoted at 110 yuan, with sales at 111 yuan per hu. Kunshan original white japonica was quoted at 112 yuan, with sales at 108-109 yuan per hu. Qingjiao saw thin rice quoted at 105 yuan, down to 103.5 yuan.

### Stockpiling Not Only Rice But Also Foreign Flour

The foreign flour market continued to see rising prices. Since the tensions in the Pacific increased, all kinds of food have been viewed favorably, and stockpilers have been exceptionally active. Since rice prices have limited room to rise, speculators have focused on stockpiling miscellaneous grains. Among them, the Zhenjiang merchants are the most eager to hoard. Retail investors on this street are also taking the opportunity to raise the prices of flower, bird, and clock tower brand Australian flour. The initial opening of 27 yuan gradually rose to 27.7-27.8 yuan. Jinlong brand was at 26.45 yuan, and Wild Boar and Beauty brands were at 27.9 yuan, all rising by about 1 yuan compared to the end of last week. The price increase is also quite remarkable. However, a ship of foreign wheat ordered by the Fuxin factory has arrived and will soon be processed into flour for supply and sale at lower prices. Moreover, a large batch of foreign flour en route will also arrive soon, at which time there is hope for some easing.

The wheat market is quietly firming up. With the supply from the interior exhausted, a new ship of foreign wheat is being unloaded, and some of the cargo is damp. Amid the rising flour prices, those holding goods are quoting higher prices. Although the Japanese factory is willing to lower prices, there are no spot goods to be collected, and the market presents a stalemate.

### Saigon Rice Sales Market

— He

Everyone knows that Japan lacks rice. To compensate for this, in addition to scavenging from Chinese producing areas, Saigon is also a major supply region. According to investigations, the production of rice in Japan from 1939 to 1940 was already in serious shortage, and the production from 1940 to 1941 decreased by another 15%. The shortage of rice in Japan this year is approximately 1.5 million tons. Vietnam was forced to supply a large amount of rice in exchange for Japan's surplus textiles. In February alone, Japan dispatched no less than seven specialized ships to Saigon to transport rice.

The export volume of Vietnamese rice accounts for 45% of the total exports, with an annual value of US$41 million. Due to the strong demand from all parties, the export volume in 1939 totaled 1,692,000 tons, an increase of 15% last year. Since the fall of France, Europe no longer receives supplies of Vietnamese rice. Those who have replaced it include China (especially Shanghai), as well as India, the Philippines, and British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. Governments of various countries, aware of the urgency of the war situation, are pre-purchasing large quantities of rice to prepare for any eventuality.

In 1938, Japan imported very little rice from Saigon. By 1939 and 1940, the number increased greatly. According to Japanese estimates, the export volume of Vietnamese rice this year will be 1.5 million tons, of which 700,000 tons will be imported into Japan, and the remainder will be imported into India, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and China. In 1939, Vietnam imported a total of 21,500 tons of rice into Shanghai. Last year, this increased to 269,000 tons. This year, the number of imports is expected to be similar to last year. In January of this year, Shanghai imported more than 50,000 tons of rice, four-fifths of which came from Saigon. The following table compares the general situation of rice imports into Shanghai in January of this year with the same period in the previous two years.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Oil Cakes and Miscellaneous Grains All Soar

The market for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes is soaring in the face of increasingly tense world war conditions. Speculators are smiling from ear to ear. Soybeans rose by 2 yuan, with over 5,000 bags traded. See the market price column for details. Corn rose by 3 yuan, with 3,000 bags of spot goods and 300 tons of futures traded. Soybean oil rose by 4-5 yuan, with 100 lots, 100 dan, 500 barrels, and 2,300-2,400 barrels of futures traded. Peanut oil also rose by several yuan, with 150 lots and 800 cans sold. Bean cake jumped by 30 cents. Other red grains and the like also rose sharply by 80 cents to 1 yuan. However, before shells have started to fly, it is unclear whether various goods will be constrained. Speculators are blindly following, unaware of whether their wishes will be fulfilled. Today, 1,400 bags of corn are being shipped to Yantai, 120 bags of peanuts, and 600 bags of beans are being shipped to Xiamen. Also, 300 bags of sesame, 10,080 pieces of bean cake, and 800 bags of beans are being shipped to Hong Kong.

### Yarn and Cotton: Speculation Active; Cotton Yarn Rebounds; "Double Horse" Rises Above 400 Yuan; Guangdong Merchants Exclusively Sell March Futures

The yarn market has turned firm, and a rising trend has begun. This is because rumors in the market have subsided, while foreign exchange has contracted and benchmark gold has risen, causing speculators to become active again. As for the Hong Kong merchants, their need for scattered purchases is still active, so people's hearts are good, and the market has risen. The high price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn in the morning was 1,392 yuan, and the low price was 1,365 yuan. The initial price in the afternoon was 1,384 yuan, followed by 1,402 yuan, and the final price was 1,399 yuan. Guangdong merchants sold about 500-600 bales of March futures. Today, 625 pieces of cotton yarn are being shipped to Hong Kong.

The morning opening for "Double Horse" was stable and quiet, with the initial price at 1,365 yuan. After this opening, buyers were very active, gradually rising to 1,392 yuan. Then, because those taking profits sold, the form was slightly weak, falling to 1,377 yuan, but the closing slightly rebounded, to 1,380 yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 7,380 bales were traded. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed below:

Hong Kong 560
Inland 10
Ningbo 10
Fellow Merchants 6,800

Total 7,380

The spot cotton situation remains dull, because yarn factories are not operating smoothly and there is a lack of sales for spot yarn.

The New York cotton market was active and firm due to purchases by fellow traders and good cotton cloth trade. As a result, closing prices rose by 2-3 pounds compared to the previous day.

Indian cotton is still scarce in large-scale trade, and the market rose slightly with speculative purchases. Yesterday, the forecast also rose by more than one rupee.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trade remains quiet. At a time when the electricity problem has not been resolved and yarn factories are finding it increasingly difficult to operate, all parties certainly have no ability to develop.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Suddenly Tightens

Factory Cloth: The market opened flat yesterday morning and rose firmly in the afternoon. This was because the exchange rate tightened and sentiment turned bullish. Fellow traders and dyeing factories continued to absorb goods at lower prices. Because the electricity problem at the factories has not been resolved, it is rare to offer futures, and the supply of goods is tight. Selling prices for fine cloth and twill rose by 25-50 cents per bolt, and coarse cloth rose by about 25 cents. Dapeng Fugui fine cloth was sold at 43.25 yuan in the morning and rose to 43.75 yuan in the afternoon. Over 500 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. Sales to customers were lackluster. Merchants from the Zhejiang route (Wenzhou and Ningbo) purchased over 100 pieces of colored cloth and coarse and fine cloth. Merchants from the Fujian and Guangdong areas purchased over 200 pieces of blue cloth, colored drill, and poplin. Merchants from the northern route (Yantai and Tianjin) purchased over 100 pieces of colored cloth, serge, and poplin. On the 4th, 75 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Xiamen and 1,960 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: A rising trend has gathered again. White fine cloth and fine twill continue to rise in price because of consistent actual sales and stockpilers' buying. Prices soared by more than 1 yuan per bolt. Twelve-pound Flying Fish fine cloth opened high in the afternoon market at 49.5 yuan. Dragon Head fine cloth has new and old stack orders, leaving buyers helpless, and the rising momentum is also slow. The closing price for new orders was only 48.5 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge was at 1.28 yuan in the morning market, and later jumped to 1.325 yuan due to absorption by speculative retail investors.

### Woolens and Serges in Prime Spring Sales Season

Yesterday, the woolens and serges market was good, with brisk retail and wholesale transactions. Merchants from Xiamen sent numerous woolens and serges packages by mail, and the number of ships sailing to Zhejiang increased again. Woolens and serges being transshipped from Ningbo to Jinhua, Jiangxi, Guiyang, Hengyang, Chongqing, and Chengdu increased greatly. On this street, Western suit shops on Avenue Joffre, Dasing Street, Szechuen Road, and Chengan Temple Road, woolens and silk brocade shops on Chessboard Street and Nanking Road, clothing shops on Siccawei Road, and used goods shops on Woosung Road all saw strong buying for various spring season goods. Because it is the prime spring sales season, demand is increasing frequently, and the outbound flow is active, leading to increased trading. In addition to spring goods, even goods for the summer, autumn, and winter seasons are being picked up, so business is becoming more prosperous.

### Securities: Government Bonds Hover and Gain Momentum

The over-the-counter market for government bonds was very quiet and stable yesterday. Market prices hovered in the range of 20-30 cents. Xinfu's buying has not stopped, but because sellers are scarce and buying is also low, all parties are watching and the market is unusually dull. Shunchang and Xinfu bought in the morning, and Xincheng and Runde sold. Most parties stood on the sidelines, and transactions were no more than 100,000-200,000 yuan before noon. Market prices rose and fell by only 5-10 cents. In the afternoon, Xinfu continued to buy, and Renfeng suddenly bought in 200,000-300,000. However, Lianhe and Jiufeng continued to supply, and market prices continued to weaken by 5-10 cents. As a result, Class D and 96 did not open, and although Class E did not rise or fall, the others rose and fell slightly by 10-30 cents. Transactions were only over 700,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Stocks: Easy transactions. The Commercial Press traded 50 shares at a price of 89 yuan.

Public Shares: The stock market opened stable, then gradually softened. Although there were small rebounds, it was ultimately unable to maintain a firm trend due to the large number of sellers. Trading volume was not high throughout the day.

### Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Both Rebound Well

The sugar market resumed its firm trend yesterday. Both raw and refined white sugar rebounded well. The association quoted 24 raw white in the spot market, initially at 79.7 yuan, then rising to 79.8-79.9 yuan. Delivery orders for March 10 were at 80-80.1 yuan, and delivery orders for March 20 were at 80.3 yuan. Dutch raw sugar rose from 61.4 yuan and then strengthened, rising to 62 yuan and 62.5 yuan, up 70 cents. Taikoo refined white B mark was at 80.5-81 yuan, Dongzhan was at 80.8 yuan, DY mark was at 79 yuan, and HX mark was at 78.2 yuan. 360 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Coal: Power Company Purchases Coal; Indian Coal Even More Scarce

The business of bituminous coal has recently seen the power company search for a large quantity, reaching more than 30,000 tons, from fellow traders, resulting in a sudden shortage of spot goods on the market. Stockpilers are also holding out for high prices, and market prices are rising sharply, suddenly increasing by over ten yuan. The rising trend of May last year is reappearing. Indian bituminous coal is being quoted at 255 yuan to 260 yuan at most. Other secondary goods are also rising in unison, it is said.

### Medicinal Materials: Price of Small Gardenia Rises

After the initial rise in the price of small gardenia in the first market, there has been no further opening. Existing stocks are still not thick. According to a letter from the Rongfang district, the number of this year's outputs is not large, so processing prices are tight, and the recent market has risen by another 20 yuan, so market quotations are also high, it is said.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Tangerine Peel Jam Market Firm and Active

Tangerine Peel Jam: Production prices are high, there has been a lack of arrivals, and market stocks have been exhausted. The outbound sales channel will be moving, and market prices are expected to rise. Shenxia should be close, and the companies have already sent letters urging shipment. Arrivals may be soon, it is said.

### Economic Miscellany: Review of the Inflow of Diamonds into China

— Feng Liutang

Since the publication of the article on diamonds, I have received a letter from Mr. Zhang Jingle (January 9), which reads:

"Recalling the spring of the 29th year, I, considering that the measuring instruments used by diamond dealers are all imported products, thought of imitating several kinds in order to reduce losses. So I made two kinds of diamond measuring pliers and balances, and compiled a book of diamond measurement comparison tables, with a short record of diamond knowledge to increase readers' interest. I welcome criticism and supplementation. Unexpectedly, years have passed, and no one in this industry has taught me a single word. I also know that my writing is short and clumsy, and I have not been able to attract jade! Now, reading your macro article, I have benefited a lot. However, I would like to know when and by whom diamonds were first imported into China, and in what year and in what way Carat (the not widely used world metric system) was changed to 200 milligrams and two points. I am emboldened to ask, and I enclose a copy of the diamond measurement comparison table, hoping for your corrections."

In addition to expressing my gratitude to Mr. Zhang for his generous gift, I have recently read history and discovered one of the points that Mr. Zhang wants to ask in his first question. I am taking advantage of today's holiday to answer Mr. Zhang and inform readers:

The term "diamond" is found in the History of the Ming Dynasty, as mentioned in the previous article. As for when and by whom they were imported into China, it is not easy to find in Chinese history books and notes. Chinese literati are skilled at poetry and articles, but things that involve some physics are regarded as craftsmanship, trivial skills, not worth mentioning, let alone recording. The creation of Economic Miscellany is deliberately trying to put effort into this kind of place, so it often costs a lot and achieves little. The completion of an article does not take much effort, but the effort spent on weekdays is not small. Therefore, for the beginning of things, there is only one way to infer from the words and sentences. This is also the only way to do it when there is no other way.

China's communication with foreign countries gradually flourished after the Six Dynasties, but most of them were taken from the land route. Although the sea route was , it was not prosperous. Even the Mongols' attack on Europe and Asia was from land. The benefits of navigation became apparent when Zheng He went to the South Seas seven times during the reign of Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty. Starting from the first voyage in the third year of Yongle (1405 AD) and ending in the fifth year of Xuande (1430 AD), he made a voyage to more than 30 countries and took countless unnamed treasures. In these four words of "unnamed treasures," it is not known how much of the goods from the South Seas and Western Europe were included in the flow of people into China. Not only that, but at that time, tropical animals were offered as tributes to the Ming court, such as Bengal frequently offering unicorns, and countries such as Lumei offering lions and rhinos, which are not uncommon. Unicorns, according to the Ming History, are indeed giraffes produced in Africa today. Lions and rhinos go without saying! By the time of Emperor Zhengde of the Ming Dynasty, the Portuguese had already come to Guangdong. At that time, Western goods were seen in poems, such as Wu Kuan's poem thanking Western Regions glasses. The reporter had questioned the scope of the words "Western Regions" in the glasses test, and now there is also evidence that the existing glasses in the Western Regions are not necessarily from Malacca.

As for the period when pearls, jade, and gems flowed into China from foreign countries, the most prosperous period was during the reign of Emperor Shizong of the Ming Dynasty. (Jiajing 1st year - 45th year, 1522 AD - 1566 AD) After the middle of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Shizong was very fond of Taoist techniques, building fasting and sacrifices, collecting wood, collecting sandalwood, and collecting pearls, jade, and gems, so that officials and people were busy. He used more than 300,000 catties of yellow and white wax, more than 100,000 catties of aloeswood, frankincense, and lacquer, and also purchased ambergris in separate ways, which was not obtained for more than ten years, so he asked foreign ships to enter Macau, which was the beginning of the Portuguese occupation of Macau. He also used red and yellow jade to make Fangze dynasty altars and vessels, which he bought from the borders of Shaanxi and could not get (that is, bought from Western Region merchants), and sent envoys to Atan, two thousand miles southwest of Turpan, to seek them. He used the silver from the Taicang treasury and used people to transport it, handling gold, treasure, and pearls. As a result, cat's eye stones, grandmother's stone, edges of Saxony stone, red thorn stone, Beihe wash stone, and sweet yellow jade were all purchased. Emperor Muzong inherited it, and the purchase of jewels was even more urgent. Emperor Shenzong was greedy, and the price of jewels increased twenty times as much as before. The magistrate of Shuntian Prefecture was punished for buying large beads of crow green for trade, which shows the emperor's eagerness to search for jewels, and the inflow of foreign jewels must be high.

From this, it can be known that there was diamond input in the middle of Shizong, and the mediator of the input was undoubtedly the Portuguese, because the Portuguese had already settled in Macau at that time.

As for when the weight of each carat was changed to 200 milligrams, Mr. Zhang and I are currently both aware of this, but we do not know why. We will introduce it to readers when it is discovered in the future. Fortunately, learning has no end. One person's mind and talent are not used here, but they are used there. What I do not know, others may know. To supplement what is known with what is not known is also the way to learn from each other.

Mr. Sheng Kezhong raised doubts and asked about the method of calculating the price of diamonds according to the size of the carat, but I am not in the industry after all, and I have no way to answer. I am taking this opportunity to ask those who run diamond businesses to give details, which should be disclosed, and I think it will also be welcomed by readers, not just Mr. Sheng.

Regarding diamond weighing methods, the refractive index of diamonds, and the evolution of diamonds, I am introducing Mr. Zhang Jingxuan's "Diamond Measurement Comparison Book" to readers, which can be checked here.

### The City's Fuel Problem: There is Currently No Shortage; Electricity Supply Takes Step-by-Step Reduction; Coal Supply is Continuous and Uninterrupted; The City's Industrial Circle Does Not Overemphasize This Matter

The entire fuel problem in Shanghai is highly valued by all parties. According to investigations, the amount of coal in stock in the city is approximately 150,000 tons, which cannot be said to be small. The committee organized by the Public Works Department to study the electricity supply problem is scheduled to continue its meeting today to discuss the electricity supply problem, and is scheduled to submit a proposal at the Public Works Department's board meeting tomorrow. According to news from authoritative sources, the committee plans to submit the following recommendations: (1) The plan proposed by the Shanghai Electric Power Company to reduce the electricity supply should be implemented gradually, so that the city's industry will not suffer adversely, and the requester itself will not suffer any losses. (2) The Public Works Department should assist the Shanghai Electric Power Company in obtaining ships to transport coal and oil. At the same time, Chinese factories here are now trying to cope with the new situation after the Public Works Department approves the Shanghai Electric Power Company's plan to reduce the electricity supply.

Considering Shortening Working Hours: Yesterday (March 3) morning, after the news that the Shanghai Electric Power Company only had a three-month supply of coal spread, Chinese manufacturers in the city have considered the steps to be taken when the electricity supply is lacking. Now that the City Chamber of Commerce has closed, and the electricity supply may be reduced in the short term, some factories are now considering shortening working hours. At present, most Chinese factories operate day and night, consuming 60% of the total electricity supplied by the Shanghai Electric Power Company.

Some Factories Do Not Emphasize

Also, some Chinese factories have stated that they do not overemphasize this matter, because some factories have already been forced to close due to a lack of raw materials. They deny that coal reserves have decreased, claiming that more coal was imported last month than in the same period last year. In addition, a large batch of coal is on its way to Shanghai, and maritime personnel in the city have not been ordered to stop transporting goods, so the ship problem is not particularly serious.

Coal Sources Increasing Rather Than Decreasing

In recent days, foreign coal sources have been increasing rather than decreasing. However, rumors are rampant in the market, saying that the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly tense and coal sources will be interrupted, or that coal transportation costs are soaring and costs are increasing. However, according to inquiries, orders for shipment to Shanghai are still continuously en route. Yesterday, the Mora wheel loaded 2,700 tons of Hongji white coal and No. 1 small coal from Annam, which has been unloaded onto the stack. The coal is managed by Yitaixing and Nanyang Coal Ball Company. However, all sectors are eager for the two companies to sell the coal immediately and supply it to the market in the short term.

Quantity Shipped to Shanghai in January is Considerable

The quantity of coal shipped to Shanghai in January of this year has been calculated by the Jianghai Customs. The following is a record, totaling 118,319 metric tons, with a value of 950,247 gold units, equivalent to 2,572,319 yuan in national currency. Among them, Japan accounted for the most, with 45,009 metric tons, followed by British India, with 29,165 metric tons, third by Taiwan, with 18,322 metric tons, fourth by Korea, with 14,941 metric tons, and fifth by Annam, with 11,000 metric tons. Re-exports totaled 210 metric tons, so coal from cheap sources was the most abundant in January.

Machine Oil Sold Out; New Goods Have Not Arrived

It was learned yesterday that the machine oil of a certain American oil company here has been used up, and the machine oil currently stored by other oil companies is also low, so there is a shortage of machine oil in Shanghai. It is said that the above-mentioned American oil company had no machine oil to supply to the shop owners yesterday morning, and the reason given was that the inventory had been sold out, and new goods would not arrive in Shanghai until the end of the month. Other oil companies sold a limited amount of machine oil yesterday (March 3), but were unwilling to negotiate large-volume sales transactions, and were only prepared to deliver a small amount of machine oil.

Gasoline Reserves are Still Sufficient

At the same time, some merchants and individuals in the city, fearing that gasoline would also be in short supply soon, added to their purchases yesterday. It was heard that most of those who added to their purchases of gasoline and machine oil yesterday were car and truck rental companies. However, according to calls from gasoline companies in the city, there is currently a sufficient amount of gasoline available, and there will be no shortage for several months. The theory that gasoline will be in short supply is likely to be spread by speculators who intend to hoard gasoline and make profits.

### British Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai Today Aboard the Yushēng Steamer

Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, departed Chongqing by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane on February 25th, stopped in Hong Kong for three days, and was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai by steamer on the first of this month. According to information obtained yesterday from the British Embassy in China, the Ambassador and his party are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today aboard the Yushēng steamer of Jardine Matheson & Co. There have been rumors that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr will travel to Singapore, but the embassy cannot confirm this.

### French Municipal Council Adjusts Economic Contributions and Taxes

In order to adjust economic contributions and tax issues, the French Municipal Council has recently re-established the Economic and Tax Adjustment Committee. The list of committee members, as suggested by the chairman of the board of directors, are as follows: J. Donne, Ed Egle, R. Pontet, Zu Xingrang (the above four are all directors of the board), D. A. Sadoo (Chairman of the French Chamber of Commerce), and D. Martionli (Chief Engineer and Manager of the Qiúxīn Factory), totaling six people. They will conduct research and reforms on various issues related to the administrative economy and taxes of the concession.

### Enthusiastic Donations to the New Public Nursery

The New Public Nursery continued to receive enthusiastic donations from all sectors yesterday, and also received many monthly donations. A summary is as follows: Lù Gēng, 1000 yuan; an anonymous person from Songjiang, 100 yuan; Tóng Jūnmíng, 50 yuan; Chén Hǎilíng, 20 yuan; Huá Shēn Dá, 12 yuan; Zhèng Huái, 5 yuan; Chén Wénxǐng, 3 yuan.

Donation collection points are: (1) Silk Industry Bank Trust, 460 Hankou Road; (2) Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, Sassoon House, The Bund; (3) Jìhuá Táng, 47 Yun Road; (4) Huáměi Pharmacy, 356 Fuzhou Road; (5) Catholic Church, Tiānzhǔtáng Street, Rue Yangtszepoo.

### American Red Cross Relief Rice and Wheat Soon to Arrive in Shanghai

The third batch of rice and wheat from the American Red Cross for Chinese disaster relief is on its way to Shanghai. According to a reporter from the Ping Ming News Agency who interviewed the China branch of the American Red Cross in Shanghai yesterday, the association received a telegram from the American Red Cross stating that the third batch of rice and wheat donated to Chinese disaster victims includes 80,000 bags of American wheat and 8,000 bags of rice, which are already en route to Shanghai. The 8,000 bags of rice are being transported by the American President Lines' President Pierce, which is expected to arrive on the 8th of this month. The 80,000 bags of American wheat are being transported by the American President Lines' President Cleveland, which is sailing to Shanghai for the first time and is expected to arrive on the 9th of this month. The association is currently discussing the distribution plan for these relief rice and wheat. It is also learned that Dr. Baker flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong last month to plan relief efforts and will soon fly back to Chongqing, with no plans to stop in Shanghai.

### Rice Merchants Anxious About People's Food Supply, Requesting Daily Supply of 10,000 Bags, Black Market Prices Rampant, Exceeding Limits Further and Further, Wholesale and Retail Sales Insufficient, Causing Panic

The Shanghai Rice Merchants Association sent a letter to the authorities of the two concessions yesterday, stating: "To Whom It May Concern, Since the soaring rice prices have affected the people's food supply, although foreign sources are smooth and inventories are thick, outbound volume is also robust. However, the market transactions have been misled by rumors for the past ten days. Those with goods are reluctant to sell, resulting in a situation of having a market but no goods. It is rumored that black market transactions are rampant,

especially today,

exceeding the limits further and further. According to the set price limits, there is actually no goods to buy. Our fellow rice merchants engage in wholesale and retail sales, supplying the entire city's food supply, purchasing at any time to meet market needs. Once there is a shortage of goods for sale, it will inevitably cause panic among the people. Our fellow rice merchants are in this environment, wanting to abide by the price limits but having no goods to buy. If we want to meet wholesale needs and purchase exceeding the limits, the sacrifice is too great. Currently, the inventories of each rice merchant

are about to be exhausted.

If this continues without remedy, not only will the people's food supply be in danger and difficult to relieve, but the local public order will also be greatly affected. Therefore, we are writing to humbly request your authorities to consider the importance of the people's livelihood and promptly order those holding goods to supply the market with 10,000 bags of rice daily to meet the people's food needs and avoid causing panic. This is our earnest prayer."

### Japanese Sentries in Western Shanghai Open Fire, Killing a Peddler, More Than One Hundred Arrested Are Sent to Hongkou for Imprisonment

At about 6:00 AM yesterday, more than ten impoverished male and female peddlers from the Hongqiao Town area of Western Shanghai each purchased dozens of kilograms of domestic rice and smuggled it into the concession through the barbed wire, hoping to earn a meager profit. When they reached the barbed wire entrance in front of Shiziwan, east of the Xujiahui Railway Station in Western Shanghai, they were suddenly spotted by Japanese sentries pre-positioned there, who opened fire. One male peddler from Jiangbei, aged about 30, was killed on the spot, and two male and female were injured. The rest scattered and fled. Recently, prices of all goods have been expensive, and the general public cannot maintain their livelihood. Therefore, villagers from the suburbs of Caohejing, Meilong, Hongqiao, and Qibao in Western Shanghai have formed groups to purchase daily necessities such as cigarettes, cloth, sugar, and oil in Xujiahui, transporting them to the inland areas to make a living. However, the above-mentioned goods are all controlled by the Japanese side and are not allowed to be transported to the inland areas. The general impoverished peddlers then smuggle goods through the barbed wire near the Tushanwan area, hoping to get lucky. Recently, this was discovered by the Japanese side. Over the past two days, more than 200 people have been arrested, mostly women and children, and transported to Hongkou for imprisonment in freight trucks.

### If Japan Audaciously Advances South, It Will Inevitably Suffer a Cruel Retaliation, Britain and the United States Have Completed Arrangements and Will Act in a Timely Manner, Economic Blockade and Military Action Proceeding in Tandem

As Japan continues to aggressively pursue its southward advance, the situation in the Far East is deteriorating daily. Britain and the United States, with their traditional and significant interests in the South Sea Islands and their military bases such as Singapore and Manila forming strategic cornerstones, will naturally not allow Japan to advance southward unchallenged. Therefore, they are also actively preparing for retaliation and have plans to jointly implement an economic blockade to sanction Japan. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency, believing that the Anglo-American economic blockade is closely related to the overall situation, visited a foreign observer in Shanghai yesterday to inquire about the possible developments of the Anglo-American economic blockade and Japan's staying power. The observer first stated that Japan's economic strength is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. If Britain and the United States start an economic blockade and China can also take the opportunity to counterattack, then Japan will be defeated within a year. Currently, Britain and the United States have completed their arrangements. If Japan disregards everything and decides to advance southward, it will inevitably suffer a cold retaliation, and its future is worrying and predictable.

Total Blockade of Japanese Trade

From the current situation, it is possible that commercial relations between Britain and the United States and Japan will be severed. If Japan does not stop its military adventures in China and its southward policy, Washington will cut off all commercial ties with it. Britain will definitely agree with this blockade policy and take unified action with the United States, and British and American territories will also respond one after another. In the end, in a war, Britain and the United States would swiftly and unexpectedly blockade the trade between third countries and Japan, which would be a severe blow to the Japanese economy. Although the Japanese military has been making every effort to store military materials such as coal, oil, steel, and iron in the country and in "Manchukuo" in recent years, the Japanese economy will not collapse within a few months due to the Anglo-American blockade. However, this move can at least cause Japan's stored military supplies to decrease day by day and eventually run out. According to accurate estimates, Japan's stockpile, if only decreasing and not increasing, can maintain the current production standards of the military industry for nine to twelve months. In other words, the collapse of the Japanese economy will happen at most a year later, at which time the lack of military raw materials will make it unsustainable and fall into a desperate situation.

Major Raw Materials Rely on Britain and the United States

In the three years of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has relied heavily on Britain and the United States for trade. Most of the iron, steel, tin, manganese, aluminum, tungsten, nickel, rubber, petroleum, cotton, wool, wood fiber (paper-making raw materials), leather, leather products, hemp, soda, and chemical fertilizers are supplied by Britain and the United States. The combined trade between Britain and the United States with Japan accounts for three-quarters of Japan's trade with non-Yen bloc countries. In Japan, imports from Britain and the United States account for 75 percent. Japanese exports to Britain and the United States account for 70 percent. The largest amount of imports comes from the United States, Hawaii, and the Philippines, totaling 552 million yen, equivalent to 48 percent of non-Yen bloc exports to Japan. These statistics show that if the United States implements a full-scale economic blockade against Japan, it will lose half of its imports. Last year, Japan imported goods from Britain worth 625 million yen. If Britain refuses to supply these goods to Japan, then Japan will lose another 28 percent of its imports. With British and American naval bases in Panama, the Falkland Islands, and Singapore, Japan loses 20 percent of its imports. Therefore, when the Pacific War breaks out, Japan will lose 95 percent of its imports from non-Yen bloc countries.

Unimaginable If War Breaks Out

As for exports, last year Japan's trade with non-Yen bloc countries was 1,834 million yen, of which 1,300 million yen were sold to Britain and the United States. Therefore, if Britain and the United States implement a joint blockade, Japan's exports will be reduced by 75 percent. Also, most of Japan's merchant ships operate within the sphere of influence of Britain and the United States. Therefore, once war breaks out, Japan will not be able to continue trading with non-Yen bloc countries. If Britain and the United States terminate commercial relations with Japan, of course both sides will suffer pain, but the pain suffered by Britain and the United States will be much less than that suffered by Japan. Japan only accounts for 5 percent of British and American export commerce. Therefore, the damage suffered by Britain and the United States is negligible, especially since it has no relationship with British and American defense. On the other hand, Japan is completely different. Once war breaks out, it will lose three-quarters of its normal commerce and lose raw materials, machinery, aviation fuel, and cotton and wool textiles. These items cannot be obtained from elsewhere and cannot be produced in Japan proper or in the occupied territories. It can only rely on stored materials, and when they are all used up, it will inevitably suffer a severe panic due to the lack of materials.

Anglo-American Policy is Different Now Than in the Past

At a time when the British and American economic blockade is highly likely, Japan is at a crossroads, whether to surrender to Britain and the United States or to go to war with Britain and the United States. In fact, Japan is unwilling to compromise with Britain and the United States, and going to war with Britain will encounter an economic crisis. What Japan is currently seeking is for Germany to quickly defeat Britain and the United States in the European war, so that Japan can drive Britain and the United States out of the Far East in one fell swoop. However, it is still vague when this "good opportunity" will arrive, and the stockpiled materials will continue to decrease with repeated delays. This is the diplomatic dilemma of Japan today, and its current tough attitude toward Britain and the United States is actually a bluff, nothing more than wanting to use deceptive means to induce Britain and the United States to make concessions and achieve its ambition of southward advance. However, today's Britain and the United States are far from the Britain and the United States of the past. Their attitude is firm and their position is unswerving. If Japan audaciously advances southward, military retaliation and economic blockade can defeat Japan within a year. Conversely, because Britain and the United States have adopted a firm stance in the Far East, it is enough to create a good international situation for China, making every effort to enrich China's capacity and economic reserves, and deepen Japan's quagmire in China. At that time, Japan will be attacked by the three countries of Britain, the United States, and China. The situation in the Far East will be cleared up, and China will appear in a completely new posture. The acquisition of the final victory is a guarantee for China's long-term future.

### The Issue of Tax Collection in Western Shanghai, Rumored to Be Resolved Soon, Both Sides Engage in Discussions on Specific Details, "Special Police" May Be Established Within the Next Week

### American Methodist Missionaries in China Are Not Yet Prepared to Retreat, Discussions Have Taken Place But No Final Decision Has Been Made, Seventeen People in Tokyo Have Returned Home

A senior official of the American Methodist Episcopal Church said to reporters the day before yesterday (the 2nd) that the news reported in Tokyo that the church had decided to withdraw its missionaries in North China and Central China was premature. The issue of withdrawing missionaries from the two regions has been discussed for some time, but this matter requires further study, so no final decision has been reached.

Missionaries in Japan Have No Right to Decide. A Tokyo dispatch from the Domei News Agency stated that missionaries of the American Methodist Episcopal Church in Japan held a meeting and resolved to withdraw all missionaries in Japan, Korea, North China, and Central China. In fact, the missionaries in Japan have no jurisdiction over missionaries in China and therefore have no right to decide on the withdrawal of missionaries in China.

The Methodist Episcopal Church Missionary Area. A Domei News Agency dispatch stated that missionaries of the American Methodist Episcopal Church in Japan gathered and discussed for five hours, resolving to withdraw because they could not obtain funding from the United States. Seventeen missionaries have already boarded the President Coolidge to leave Japan for the United States. According to reports, the Methodist Episcopal Church is engaged in missionary work in the Chinese provinces of Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, Gansu, Shandong, and Sichuan. There are two bishops, one Bishop Grose in Fujian, and one Bishop Wade in Chengdu, Sichuan.

### Funeral for French Police Inspector La Fon Today

He will be buried in the Lujiawan Cemetery. The memorial service will be held at the St. Dominic's Church on Rue Luban at 8:30 AM.

Death Caused by Accidental Discharge of Shotgun

The Shanghai Times reported that La Fon, a French police captain of the Foch Road Police Station in the French Concession, went hunting in the Hongqiao district yesterday (the 2nd). Upon returning, he accidentally discharged his shotgun and was fatally wounded. According to the French Police Department, La Fon went hunting with three friends in the outer district of the French Concession of Bi Lian in Western Shanghai at about 8:00 AM yesterday morning. After finishing, when getting into the car to return, he accidentally discharged the shotgun. A bullet flew out and struck him in the chest. He was rushed to Guangci Hospital but died on the way. It is learned that La Fon had served in the French Police Department for ten years, enjoyed sports, and was an outstanding member of the French Police Department's soccer team. He was 36 years old and left behind a wife and two children.

### Prohibition of Selling Cheap Goods at High Prices for Soap, Matches, etc.

The Ningbo Road Tobacco Exchange Association's trading market is where large and small businesses affiliated with the association participate in buying and selling. The various items bought and sold are mostly necessities for the citizens, such as soap, matches, toilet paper, and various tobaccos. However, since the outbreak of the incident, some businesses have taken the opportunity to hoard existing goods, resulting in market prices rising step by step. The association has resolved that all businesses participating in the market must pay 300 yuan in national currency and deposit it with the association to increase credibility. Otherwise, they will be refused entry to the market, and the sale of cheap goods at high prices is strictly prohibited.

### Interest on Construction and Military Bonds Can Be Entrusted to the Bank of China for Collection

The Central Bank Shanghai Branch will not handle these interest payments, but can be entrusted to the Chongqing branch of the bank to collect the payments.

### The Highest Philosophy Common to the Five Religions

Mr. Yang Zhongyi of the Rong Wu Discourse Society recently spoke on the highest philosophy common to the five religions, saying: "Establishing a sect as religious doctrine is called religion, hence the division of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam. Although the tenets differ, the principles they explain are the same, and although the names and appearances differ, the essence is the same. The five religions each have their own essence, but there are common and interconnected points. The highest philosophical principle is the theory of 'One in Three Persons,' which is known to be the doctrine of Christianity. It should also be known as one of the highest philosophies shared by the five religions. I will briefly cite the teachings of each religion to prove this."

1. Islam: "Al-Tawhid not three," "One in three meanings" in the Hidden Meaning of the Heavenly Method of Nature and Reason. "One Truth evolves" in the Hidden Meaning, that is, the Way of Conduct tracing back to its origin, "The Truth arises as One, the Number One becomes Evolution, the Essence One evolves and evolves," which clearly states the meaning of One in Three Persons.

2. Christianity: The Gospel of Matthew, the First Epistle of John, already contain the meaning of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit being One in Three Persons. In the Gospel of John, chapter 10, Jesus said, "You all are God." In the First Epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 3, Paul said, "You are the temple of God, and God dwells in you." In Colossians chapter 1, Paul said, "This mystery is Christ in your hearts," which is the same meaning as Jesus said, "I and the Father are one." The Holy Trinity states, "Absolutely speaking, God is one; relatively speaking, God is three persons." "To the Father belongs power, to the Son belongs knowledge, to the Spirit belongs goodness." The Father is the original body, the Son is like a clear mirror, and the Spirit is the radiance it emits. Theologians say: "God has a threefold manifestation in different visions," so God is in this person, and also fully in the other person at the same time, which is one and three. It is not to say that God has three persons and the same essence, so it is said that God is one."

3. Buddhism: "The Mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings are three without difference" in the Verse-Speaking Chapter of the Bodhisattvas in the Yama Heaven Palace of the Sixty Hua-yan Sutra. "The True Mind of sentient beings is the body of all Buddhas, without difference" in the Commentary on the Awakening of Faith. "All Buddhas and Tathagatas are the Dharma Realm Body, entering into the minds of all sentient beings. It is the mind that makes a Buddha, it is the mind that is a Buddha" in the Sutra of Contemplation on the Immeasurable Life Buddha. The Three Mysteries of Tiantai, the Three Equal Precepts of Esoteric Buddhism, the "Three Treasures as One Body" of Huineng, and the "Three Bodies as One Body" of Zen Buddhism all fuse the manifested and hidden, provisional and real aspects of the Dharma, Reward, and Response. In the Secret Treasury Record, "The Mind itself is Reality, Reality itself is the Honored One, the Honored One itself is the Mind." The cause and effect are not two, and the knower and known are one, so it is said that "the three are without difference." In the Six Explanations of the Six Kinds of Kinship in the Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra, "Sentient beings are thus, the Buddha is thus, the One Thus is without two thus." "To allow movement is the Son," "The Father of the World-Honored One, the Honored One among all Sages," "This is my son." The "Compassionate Father" and "Buddha Son" of Buddhism can be imprinted with the One in Three Persons.

4. Taoism: "One Qi transforms into the Three Pure Ones" is the most common tenet of Taoism. In the fourteenth chapter of the Tao Te Ching, "These three cannot be interrogated, kneaded into one," it also speaks of the meaning of three in one. Chapter 42, "The Tao gives birth to One, One gives birth to Two, Two gives birth to Three, Three gives birth to all things." Taoists regard the Tao as their doctrine, so they regard the Tao as the essence. The One, Two, and Three that are produced are the Spirit because of One, the Transformation because of Two, and the Way of Heaven, Earth, and Man because of Three. Zhang Zai's One Spirit Two Transformations is the same Origin with Different Names of Lao Tzu, and the Great Ultimate that gives birth to the Two Forms of Confucius. The Beginning of Qian and the Birth of Kun are called the Father and Mother. Therefore, Chapters 21 and 42 speak of the "Father," Chapters 1 and 20 speak of the "Mother," Chapter 4 speaks of the "Son," and Chapter 25, "There is a thing formed chaotically," "call it the Fourth Tao," which corresponds to the theory of One in Three Persons.

5. Confucianism: Liu Xin's Three Unifications Calendar and the Treatise on Pitch-Pipes and Calendrical Astronomy in the Book of Han both say, "The Great Ultimate Original Qi contains Three as One." The Yiwei Qianzaodu, "The Yi begins and ends as One, divides into Two, is capable of Three," Zheng Xuan annotated, "The Great Ultimate contains Three as One, living together in parallel." Therefore, the River Diagram Dynasty Record says, "Take One as the Great Ultimate." Yang Jian of Cihu has changed the Yi, "One is my One, unspeakable, unknowable," "Three is the form, One is the essence." That which cannot be spoken or named is the hidden essence of the Tao. One Yin and One Yang is the manifestation of the Tao as an image, and continuing goodness and fulfilling the essence is the expression of the Tao as a function. The Tao is not far from man and originates from the Great, its essence is not two, so its production is unfathomable, and the unfathomable is called Spirit. Mencius said, "All people can become wise." "The sage is the one who first obtains the same feeling in my heart," so Yangming said, "The streets are full of sages," and Buddhists say, "All sentient beings possess Buddha-nature." How can their sayings be different?

### Fu Rongbing Was Shot at on Nanjing Road, Sichuan Road Yesterday Afternoon; Gunman Lin Guozhen Was Captured on the Spot

### Academic Review of Secondary Schools in This City Will Still Be Handled According to the Original Methods; Add a Register of Withdrawn Students for Verification; Academic Credentials Must Still Be Preserved for One Semester

(Dahua News Agency) In order to organize the academic records of secondary schools in this city, the local education authorities, upon approval from the Ministry of Education, have formulated the "Methods for Organizing Academic Records of Wartime Secondary Schools in Shanghai," which will be implemented from the first semester of the 29th academic year, and have issued a notice to all schools to resume the work of reviewing academic records. It is known that the handling of the upper semester was very satisfactory. It was originally planned to announce the review results by school, but because the number of copies was too large, it was feared that the newspapers would not be able to publish them. Therefore, they were reviewed and ordered separately. As for the academic review work of the current semester, in addition to handling it according to the original methods, each school should first report the registers of new students, transfer students, and continuing old students. In addition, a register of withdrawn students should be added for verification. As for the academic credentials of each student, the school must still preserve them until the end of the semester for dispatching personnel for review. Each school that has not yet approved the academic records of the upper semester is ordered to reply first before reporting the single volumes of this semester, otherwise the academic records of this semester will not be reviewed. Each type of register can still be purchased directly from Zhengzhong Bookstore, but the register of withdrawn students must be prepared by themselves. In addition to publishing in the newspapers, no separate documents will be issued in this case. The items to be listed in the register of withdrawn students are listed below:

Items to be Listed in the Register of Withdrawn Students: 1. Name, 2. Gender, 3. Age, 4. Native Place, 5. Department, 6. Grade in which they studied last semester, 7. Promoted or Retained, 8. Reason for Withdrawal, 9. Transfer Certificate Number, 10. Remarks.

### The Ministry of Education Requests Guangxi, Fujian, and Jiangxi to Increase the Establishment of People's Education Halls and Handle Them According to the Regulations Promulgated by the Ministry

(Chongqing Aviation News) The Ministry of Education believes that the People's Education Hall is a comprehensive social education implementation agency that does not cost much but has great results.

According to a survey, the number of People's Education Halls recorded in Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces has reached more than 1,000.

### Western Writers Win Championship; Army Union Suffers a Miserable 5-1 Defeat

(Hong Kong Dispatch) In the final of the Lihua Cup Football Tournament, the Chinese team was full of regrets and lost the right to the final. The number of Chinese spectators was only half a hundred, and the atmosphere on the field was bleak. Western Writers and Army Union competed for the Lihua Cup. Army Commander-in-Chief Jia Naixi came to the field to receive the award. During the 90-minute process, Western Writers had the advantage, and the front line was active. Hou Lv and Fu La scored five goals. Army Union's Huo Shi and Wei Ya recovered two goals, 5 to 2. No one expected Western Writers to win. Army Union bowed their heads in submission. But in three-quarters of the entire game, the soldiers took the initiative. Although the clerks sought to leave under pressure, they immediately attacked the key parts of the army in retaliation, which made the military union angry. There were very few wonderful scenes in the battle. The two sides lined up as follows:

### Fee Reduction

— Rong Yao

One Thursday afternoon, a letter arrived at home. I opened it and saw only a few words:

"Regarding the tuition fee for the semester, after much effort and enduring countless rebuffs, I finally managed to borrow fifty dollars. It has been sent by mail. Father."

After reading the letter, I felt an extreme sadness in my heart. At the same time, the endless worries that the tuition for the next semester had increased from fifty to seventy dollars welled up in my heart.

The entire night, I was trapped in a city of sorrow, calculating how to obtain the missing twenty dollars.

From the letter from home, I could see how difficult the family's situation was. If I wrote another letter asking for money, it would only increase the suffering of my frail old father, and there would be no hope at all. As for borrowing, a stranger in a strange land with no relatives or friends, on this isolated island shrouded in the groans of the poor, trying to borrow money would truly be a dream.

After thinking all night, I finally decided to request a fee reduction from the school.

The next day, I retrieved the money from the post office and, full of hope, eagerly headed towards the school.

A huge recruitment advertisement at the school entrance caught my eye from afar, especially the red bold words "Our school has many fee reduction and free tuition places," which were particularly eye-catching. I couldn't help but feel fortunate for myself and quickened my pace, stepping into the school gate.

Inside a large office, it was already "water couldn't leak through" with people who came to pay tuition fee. Sure enough, business was booming. The principal sitting at the payment counter was so delighted that his fat face was smiling so much his eyes disappeared. It was with difficulty that I squeezed through the crowd and walked towards the principal at the payment counter.

"Ah! Are you here to pay the fee? Please sit, please sit!" He greeted me with a smiling face.

"Yes, Principal. However, I would like to request a reduction in tuition fee, is that possible?" I replied respectfully.

"What, a fee reduction? Oh! I'm really sorry, our school doesn't have such a rule." He coldly lowered his head to count the banknotes on the table, and I felt greatly disappointed.

However, with a frown, I thought of the large fee reduction words on the advertisement outside the school gate. Always clumsy, I suddenly had a flash of inspiration and decided to use "the spear of the son to attack the shield of the son."

"Huh! Then doesn't the advertisement outside the school gate clearly state that fee reductions are possible?" I said with confidence.

"Well, this..." He was clearly caught off guard by my move.

The fire of hope rekindled in my heart, and I continued to plead without hesitation, "Principal, please help me considering my grades!" I took out the report card from my pocket. "Although, I also know that the school's funding is depleted. If it weren't for you, Principal, doing your best to maintain it, would it even be able to continue operating? I am also doing this because I am forced to." I even put a high hat on him, flattering him.

"Yes, think about it, the school's monthly expenses are so huge. Just the school building alone costs thousands of dollars a month. Recently, the teachers have also been clamoring for a raise. We don't receive subsidies from the Ministry of Education either. Isn't that making things difficult for people?" He complained at length, then picked up my report card and took a look, continuing, "Let's do this. Seeing as your grades are not bad, I'll reduce your fee by ten dollars."

"Sir, can you reduce it by another ten dollars?" Like a customer haggling in a store, I asked again.

"Well, no. This is already the biggest concession. If I reduce it any more, are you telling us to drink the northwest wind? If you're still not satisfied, then you can transfer to another school, but other schools don't accept graduating classes. Haha." He smiled sinisterly and walked towards the registration office.

Alas, it's over. After talking for so long, only ten dollars was reduced. What use is that? Helpless, I hung my head and set off on the way home. Upon arriving, I collapsed and fell asleep.

The first day, seeing that there was really no other way, I hardened my heart, took off my coat, tucked it under my arm, and went to the street. Like a thief, I sneaked into the gate of a pawnshop, closed my eyes, threw the coat upwards, and said, "Fifteen dollars." Fifteen dollars and a contemptuous sneer were thrown down from the high counter. I fled the pawnshop in fear. A northwest wind cutting my face blew my whole body, making me tremble like a leaf. I gritted my teeth, braced against the cold wind, and ran to school at lightning speed.

Stepping into the office, I walked towards the fat principal sitting at the payment desk, smoking a cigarette. Passing the roaring stove, I couldn't help but stand there for a while.

"Are you here to pay the fee?" He still had that smiling face.

"Yes," I handed over the thick stack of tuition fees.

"Huh! Why is there only sixty dollars?" Truly, important people are "forgetful".

"You promised yesterday, a ten-dollar fee reduction."

"Oh, you're a fee reduction student."

His throat was twice as loud, but his eyes were shooting towards the students and parents standing at the registration office, as if afraid they wouldn't hear him. Then he stuffed the banknotes into his leather bag full of banknotes and picked up his pen to write a receipt.

"Please pay a two-dollar handling fee."

"What handling fee, sir?"

"Fee reduction handling fee."

I was stunned.

"Hurry up, this is the school's rule." He said fiercely.

Helpless, I had to pull out the five dollars I had prepared to buy books.

"Here are two dollars in change." The receipt and the banknotes were thrown over together.

"Huh! Why did you only give me two dollars in change?" Looking at the banknotes in my hand, I asked in surprise.

"Well, that's right, because the deadline for paying fees was yesterday. You're one day late today, so there's a one-dollar fine. This is the school's rule." Saying that, he picked up the half-smoked cigar from the table and started smoking with a smile on his face again.

I couldn't help but gasp and cursed inwardly, "What a cunning scoundrel."

Stepping out of the back door, I saw the huge advertisement fluttering in the wind, especially the red bold words, which seemed to emit a strange light, "flattering" the pedestrians.

I sighed deeply and felt in my pocket for the "sole remaining" two dollars and a pawn ticket.

Alas! What books can I buy with this?

Miscellaneous Thoughts

### Difference of a Few Minutes at Birth

— Ren Jiong

People are the same, but there is a difference of a few minutes at birth.

Indeed, this saying seems to be something we are already tired of hearing. However, very few people pay attention to the poison and mysteries in this sentence. Even a surprising number of fools still take it as "golden words" and use it as the only method of self-consolation, which is truly unjust and wrong!

I am not exaggerating. If you don't believe me, just look at every corner of society, where people holding this kind of thought are everywhere. Whether it is housewives, factory workers, or people living in very painful situations, especially widows, nuns, monks, etc., when they feel pain, they curse their fate. The fortune teller says I have a "laborious life," so I have been a beast of burden my whole life, and it is all attributed to the two words "bitter fate," and they never think of turning over. They never even dream of saying that this has a reason. As for what the reason is, they feel even more confused and vague, but it is just a "difference of a few minutes at birth" from rich people!

Therefore, those rulers who specialize in devising ways to make people follow their commands are satisfied. These fools who are willing to obey and accept it have actually fallen into the trap of these guys who enjoy themselves at the expense of others. Thus, these few people can exploit others generation after generation, and the majority of people are attributed to bitter fate and are forever chewed on. This has formed today's society.

Therefore, we must point out that fate is fabricated from the mouths of the blind (people who cannot see things), that it is today's society that makes you suffer, and that it has nothing to do with those fabricated fates. Please don't be deceived any longer and be forever crushed and unable to breathe. It is just like the death of those widows' husbands. The death of the husband has a reason for its death, and it also has little to do with so-called fate.

Please, friends who believe in fate, wake up! Move the time you spend cursing fate and resenting fate, and the pain that is being chewed on in your heart, to the goal of working hard and creating a new society. Although life is still painful today, the amount of pain has a big difference, and the heart is happy instead. At that time, the real world will definitely tell you what fate is all about! Let's all experience it firsthand!

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(IV) Unexpected Encounter

Just at this time, the waiter had brought the noodles and pot stickers. Zhao Si was no longer polite with Begonia, picked up a pair of bamboo chopsticks, and used them with more skill than anything else. In a few moments, only an empty bowl and an empty plate were left on the table.

Zhao Si went out swaggering with a full stomach. Begonia then called Rongkui, selected a lined gown and a twenty-dollar bill, and instructed him to send it to Zhao Yukun. This is where Rongkui's cleverness was revealed. He bought a bottle of Wu Jiapi wine and some dried beef worth a few cents on his own initiative and sent them over. Zhao Yukun was happier than anything else when he received them, and Rongkui himself easily earned more than ten dollars.

When he returned to the Tianjin Hotel, full of pride, Begonia and Ma Jinshou and a group of people were being surrounded in the room by many of Shen Mazi's apprentices, who were using various threats to make them return the advance payment they had received.

When Rongkui saw that the situation was not right, he hid in his room and dared not go up again. Fortunately, Begonia had stayed in this hotel every time he came to Tianjin to perform, and the manager got along well with him and had some influence on the ground, so he did his best to mediate and decided to talk again the next day before sending the group of people away.

"It's okay to return the advance payment, but they have to release our costumes first!" Begonia was not a person without any ideas, so he said this to the manager of the hotel.

"Of course, that's right," the manager groaned, "but if someone hurts Shen Mazi, it will be much more difficult to talk!"

Mentioning this point, Begonia was really at a loss, and the rest of the people certainly couldn't think of any good ideas.

Zhao Si didn't come back until after dinner. (Four five)

### Most Popular Songs in the Midst of the European War

— Shu Jia

Many songs often become popular with wars. The most popular song in this European war is "Beer Barrel Polka". When Canadian troops landed in England, when Australian and New Zealand troops were fighting in the Middle Eastern theater, and when British troops were assisting in France last year, they all sang this light tune as a substitute for marches; even in British air-raid shelters during surprise attacks, people were singing it. This song has sold one million copies of sheet music and is still going strong.

The second best-selling song in the United States is "South of The Border", which is also very popular in England. This song was co-written by the famous British writer and composer Connerty and Carl, and it sold about 500,000 copies of sheet music. The next is "Wish Me Luck as You Wave Me Good-bye," which has sold 450,000 copies of sheet music to date; British actress Grace Fields often sings this song to comfort the British armed forces, which is deeply loved by the soldiers.

The fourth best-selling song is Carl's solo work, "Somewhere in France," with 400,000 copies of sheet music sold. Since the British army withdrew from Dunkirk, this song has gradually been heard less often.

The above four songs are the most popular songs in this European war, but the number of sheet music sold is far less than that of British popular songs during the last World War. For example, the famous song "It's a Long, Long Way to Tipperary" during World War I sold 5 million copies of sheet music, "Roses of Picardy" sold 3 million copies, and "Keep the Home Fire Burning" also sold more than 1 million copies.

Publishers say that the decline in sales of popular song sheet music is due to the development of radio; now, once a song becomes popular, it is repeatedly broadcast on the radio. After about thirteen weeks, people get tired of hearing it, and the "life" of that song gradually comes to an end. But during the World War, the average lifespan of each popular song was about two years.

Songs symbolizing the hope of people all over the world for future happiness also have a very wide sale. A publisher asked the famous composer Irving Berlin to write a song to express this idea, and he wrote "It's a Lovely Day Tomorrow" accordingly, which sold 100,000 copies. Other songs with high sales include "It's a Hap Hap Happy Day" and "We'll Go Smiling Along".

Among the songs with current affairs themes in this European war, "Hang Out the Washing on the Siegfried Line" was the most popular for a while, selling 350,000 copies of sheet music. Publishers admit that the sales of this song have declined recently because the war on the Western Front in Europe has ended, but when British troops one day land in Europe and launch a large-scale land war, this song will definitely become popular again.

In addition, British people often suffer from air raids at night and have to take shelter in air-raid shelters, so there is a "good night" song that is often on their lips. The lyrics of this song are very simple, with the general meaning being, "Please don't think it's impolite of me to yawn, I have to get up tomorrow morning, good night, good night, did you bring the lamp, yes; did you bring the gas mask, yes, very good, good night, good night."

After hearing this, the young man carefully looked at the big man and saw a tall black horse tied under the weeping willow at the entrance. He then opened his mouth and replied, "Where are you from, strong man? It's almost noon now, and my humble abode is about to serve lunch. It's possible for me to offer the strong man a meal, please come in and sit down, what do you think?" The big man said, "Thank you, thank you." He immediately turned around and took a package from the horse, following the young man to where he was studying. The windows were bright and the table was clean, with no dust or noise. The bookshelves were filled with many books. The young man asked the big man to sit down. The big man threw the package aside, took off his hat from behind, and sat down on a chair by the window. The young man shouted into the room, "Liu San, come quickly, there's a guest here." Then a man in the appearance of a hired worker came to serve. The young man said, "Quickly bring a pot of tea, is the stove water boiling?" Liu San agreed and retreated. After a while, he brought a pot of tea and two teacups, pouring two cups of tea. The big man hurriedly drank his cup in one gulp, shouting, "It's not enough to quench my thirst. I won't be polite, please forgive my rudeness." He then took the teapot, put it to his mouth, and drank the entire pot of tea in one breath, saying, "Bring another pot. I want to drink it whether it's cold or hot. But this tea is too hot, it would be better if it were cold." The young man then told Liu San to scoop out a large bowl of spring water from the jar. Liu San agreed and brought a large bowl of clear spring water to the big man. The young man said, "Since you like to drink cold water, strong man, this is clear spring water taken from the mountain. I dare to offer it to you as a guest." The big man nodded and said, "Good." He held the bowl in one hand and drank the entire bowl of water. He laughed loudly, "Are you laughing at me for drinking like a cow?" Liu San took the empty bowl. The young man told him to add some rice and dishes. That guest would be having lunch here. Liu San agreed and left. The big man then said to the young man, "You're really good, you're good enough to be a friend. Didn't you ask me where I came from just now? I'll be honest with you. My surname is Zhang, and my name is Cangqiu, and I am from Nanyang. Since I was young, I was taught by an extraordinary person and learned some martial arts. It's just that my father was framed by an enemy, and my family was confiscated. Fortunately, I escaped with my life. Afterwards, I took advantage of a gap and killed my enemy with my own hands, avenging the irreconcilable hatred. But I have no home to go to, and the country is difficult to surrender to. I passed by Jigong Mountain alone. It happened that a group of bandits came down from the mountain to rob me, not letting me pass. They offended my anger, so I used my skills and killed many of them, breaking into the mountain stronghold. The bandits saw that I was highly skilled and were willing to surrender, pushing me to be the leader. I had nowhere else to go for a while, haha! I became king on that mountain." (Two)
