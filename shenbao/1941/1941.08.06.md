### America Decides to Devote All Its Strength to Crush Axis Powers' Conquest Strategy; Hull Resumes Duties After Sick Leave and Issues Strong Declaration; America Guarantees to Provide Material Assistance to Soviet Union as Much as Possible

United Press, Washington, 5th. Secretary of State Hull, who had been ill for two months, has now resumed his duties at the State Department. International News Service, Washington, 5th. Secretary of State Hull gave his first speech yesterday after resuming his duties, stating that the free people of the world "hold the same goal, exert the greatest strength, and have the determination to win." Hull guaranteed that the United States would do its utmost to help others crush the Axis military forces.

International News Service, Washington, 5th. Secretary of State Hull yesterday called on the entire United States to continuously strive and fight against the "military conquest operations spreading across the world," and predicted that "the victims of barbarism" would surely regain their status. At his first reception for journalists in two months, Hull strongly urged the American countries and other independent nations to "unite as one." Hull stated that "those who call themselves conquerors" can only be defeated by this unity. Hull's resolute remarks were made in response to the general demand for him to announce the international situation. Hull stated, "In the weeks of my absence, what we have firmly believed for several years would happen has now occurred with clear evidence. Reasonable people will understand this without argument, namely, that a military conquest operation has occurred worldwide, with methods to rule over the conquered peoples, most of whom are eliminated through barbarism and cruel means." Hull continued, stating that the current situation requires a continuous increase in national defense, ensuring its maximum efficiency everywhere and at all times.

United Press, Washington, 5th. Undersecretary of State Welles stated yesterday that the United States has formally agreed to provide the Soviet Union with as much assistance as possible. This promise of assistance was expressed in an exchange of notes, which extended the existing trade agreement between the two countries for another year. The notes were signed and exchanged on Saturday by Welles and the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Umansky. The United States has agreed to prioritize assistance to the Soviet Union with essential military supplies and to give the most friendly consideration to Soviet orders. It also plans to expand shipping facilities to transport aid and has agreed to abolish all export restrictions to the Soviet Union, guaranteeing that the Soviet Union can obtain various general permits to transport unlimited quantities of essential goods. The significance of this exchange of notes between the United States and the Soviet Union is that the Soviet Union will receive assistance from the United States in the same way as China and the United Kingdom, but without enjoying the benefits of the Lend-Lease Act. The Soviet Union can purchase American military supplies by paying cash or gold. In return, the Soviet Union guarantees to resist Germany to reciprocate the economic assistance received. Welles stated that the determination of the United States is to provide the Soviet Union with all possible economic assistance to strengthen its ability to resist aggression. The United States made this rapid decision because it believes that strengthening the Soviet Union's ability to resist such aggression, which not only endangers the security and independence of the Soviet Union but also threatens the security and independence of other countries, is of utmost importance to the national defense of the United States. Welles also pointed out that the requests from the Soviet Union and the orders placed with the United States, as well as the prompt delivery, will be given the most friendly consideration. Welles further stated that the United States will give priority to Soviet orders when implementing all applicable principles for orders from anti-aggression nations.

### Soviet Naval Commander-in-Chief Transferred to Vladivostok; Rumor Has It That President Roosevelt Will Meet With the British Prime Minister

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 5th. According to news from Moscow yesterday, Soviet Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Kuznetsov has been ordered to transfer to Vladivostok. The vacant position will be filled by Vice Admiral Orlov, who has been promoted to Admiral.

Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, 5th. According to British and American sources here, British Prime Minister Churchill will soon meet with US President Roosevelt. The meeting place will not be announced, but it will be somewhere in the Western Hemisphere.

Singapore Prepares to Cope With Emergencies; British Side Denies Stationing Troops on Thai Border

Reuters, Singapore, 5th. Singapore is prepared to cope with any emergency. All aspects of passive defense are undergoing extensive training. Large-scale exercises are conducted throughout the island day and night. Air defense teams, auxiliary fire brigades, and medical rescue teams are also participating.

United Press, Singapore, 5th. A large number of Indian and British troops arrived here yesterday, including Royal Air Force personnel. Also arriving was the Prince of Patiala, who is here to inspect the Indian troops in Malaya. According to the newly arrived soldiers, no incidents occurred along the way.

Reuters, Singapore, 5th. Today's editorial in the "Free Press" solemnly warns the civilians of Singapore not to assume that the current crisis in the Far East can be peacefully resolved just because other recent crises in the Far East have been resolved. It also states that while there is no need to panic about the future, it would be dangerous to ignore the signs. Studying these signs can reassure us about the current situation, especially regarding the weakness of Japan's domestic front, which cannot withstand a war with Britain, the Dutch East Indies, or even the United States. However, apart from extreme fanatics, Japanese leaders may feel that attacking Malaya and the Dutch East Indies may not make Japan's situation worse than it is today. While the success or failure of this move is uncertain, it could provide a pretext for Japan to shirk responsibility for the unpleasant state of affairs that exists today. Therefore, the current policy of stability is based on the assumption that Japan is insatiable and will make our very solid defenses and economic preparations as perfect as possible, leaving nothing to regret.

Reuters, London, 5th. Reuters has learned that the rumor that Britain has sent 100,000 troops to the Thai border is not true. The deployment of British troops in Singapore is purely defensive and there has been no large-scale troop movement as rumored.

United Press, Saigon, 5th. The French authorities acknowledged today that they knew of reports from the Japanese side that a British fleet had appeared in the Gulf of Siam. A representative of the Japanese acquisition delegation stated that this news was highly likely, but the rumor of the discovery of a British fleet spread rapidly here last night, but even semi-official confirmation could not be obtained.

Australia and New Zealand Appoint Defense Commanders, Determined to Defend Their Territory

Havas News Agency, Melbourne, 4th. It has been officially announced that General Mackay, formerly commander of the Australian forces on the North African Libyan front, has been transferred to be the commander of the Australian Home Guard. According to well-informed sources, federal defense is becoming increasingly important and must be presided over by someone who has experienced modern warfare to be effective. General Mackay's assumption of this new post is truly a perfect match of person and position.

Reuters, Sydney, 5th. Australian Army Minister Spender said yesterday that Australia is now watching the increasingly tense situation in the Far East with a calm and determined gaze. What we earnestly desire is to maintain peace in the Pacific, but we are not prepared to abandon the interests and territories of the British Empire under the threat of guns. We all bear the responsibility of defending these interests and territories and will not allow them to be destroyed by secret erosion. Vietnam, Malaya, and Thailand are close neighbors to Australia, just as they are to Japan. We are concerned to see Japanese troops arrive in Vietnam and there is no shortage of signs that Japan intends to go further. Japan's talk of protection is nothing more than a pretext for shameless aggression. If necessary, Australia will demonstrate its determination to decide its own destiny. The 90,000 Australian troops already deployed overseas will be greatly increased. More than 160,000 people have already enlisted in the Australian army, and there are 250,000 militiamen responsible for domestic defense.

Reuters, Melbourne, 5th. The Australian Army Minister announced on the radio last night that a total of 160,000 people have joined the Australian Imperial Forces, of whom 90,000 have been sent overseas. This is the first announcement of the number of Australian troops. Today, according to official sources, in proportion to the population, Australia's troop numbers seem to exceed even Canada's 576,000. Australia currently has 200,000 people for domestic defense, and a large number of personnel serve in the Australian Navy and Air Force.

Japan Forces Thailand to Embrace Them, Saying They Will Not Hesitate to Fight If Necessary

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told reporters today that the rumors that Japan is about to invade Thailand are untrue. This can be seen from the Vietnam joint defense treaty. Japan is only considering joint defense of Vietnam with France, and is only conducting economic negotiations with Thailand.

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. This morning, several newspapers here carried editorials with the same tone, saying that Thailand must learn a lesson from the fate of Vietnam and trust Japan as its protector to remove the pressure from Britain and the United States.

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. "Kokumin Shimbun" published an editorial stating that the Dutch East Indies cannot escape Japan's co-prosperity sphere. However, Japan is now paying attention to Thailand first. Thailand is now under pressure from China, Britain, and the United States, and its security is threatened. Thailand announced on July 28 that it was prepared to resist aggression and did not recognize any country that had threatened or oppressed it. This statement was made under duress. The article cited Thailand's recent cooperation with Japan, but stated that Thailand's actions were not entirely clear, and hoped that it would take Vietnam as a model.

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. Waseda University's Nakano published an article in "Yomiuri Shimbun" yesterday, stating that Japan has made a great determination. The Japanese people do not want war, but if necessary, they will not hesitate to shed blood like rivers and pile up corpses like mountains to defend themselves and protect the nation's honor. The landing of Japanese troops in Vietnam has strengthened the southern defenses, but the pressure from Britain and the United States in East Asia is no different from war. Japan should fight to the last person to break the blockade that Britain and the United States are currently imposing on Japan.

### All of Vietnam Occupied; Japanese Troops Gather in Saigon; Riverside Houses Requisitioned; Large Numbers of Aircraft Gather in Nha Trang

Reuters, Saigon, 5th. The Japanese military headquarters here stated that the Japanese army has now occupied all the bases in Vietnam granted to Japan by the Vichy government under the Vietnam Joint Defense Agreement, so the Japanese landing has now been completed.

Reuters, Saigon, 5th. The landing of Japanese troops in Saigon is still in full swing. The general truth of the actions of the past six days is now gradually becoming clear. Japanese troops began landing in Nha Trang on July 28, and entered the Saigon area on the 30th. General Sumita and his entourage had already arrived here on the 26th in several trucks. The port of Saigon is filled with Japanese troop transports, freighters, and warships. Twenty-five troop transports have already arrived, unloading troops and war materials. There are still thirty ships outside Cape Saint Jacques. It is said that most of the occupying forces must land in Saigon. The war materials seem to be in order and the soldiers are mostly young, with no signs of battle experience. Houses are currently being occupied. Warehouses, chambers of commerce, large hotels, large commercial firms, and riverside houses and large private residences stretching half a mile in Saigon have been requisitioned, but British commercial premises have not been affected. The French shipping company's ship "Chaffee" is currently docked on the river, where the Europeans evicted from the Grande Hotel and other places can temporarily reside on board. On the surface, Saigon is still quiet, and the Japanese soldiers are not acting out of line. As for the French troops and war materials, they are moving north. All vehicles are now concentrated in the south, causing normal train services to be suspended. French aviation services have now been cancelled because the airport is occupied by Japanese fighters and trucks, leaving French aircraft with nowhere to take off or land. Most of the Japanese aircraft are temporarily gathered in Nha Trang, estimated at 250 aircraft, or said to be two squadrons of fighters and one squadron of bombers. Japanese truck transport teams are now heading to Cambodia one after another. Two teams of anti-aircraft guns and field guns have been seen heading north.

### Two American Warships Arrive in Australia; This Trip Is a Training Cruise

Reuters, Washington, 5th. The U.S. Navy Department announced that the heavy cruisers "Northampton" and "Salt Lake City" have arrived in Brisbane, Australia. It is said that this trip is a training cruise. The commander of the two ships is Rear Admiral Tinfett. This decision to enter Brisbane is to refuel and give the crew a few days of rest.

### Dutch East Indies Issues Order Requisitioning Horses; Preliminary Step in Mobilization Plan

Reuters, Batavia, 5th. The Dutch East Indies has issued an order to requisition horses. This is a preliminary step in the mobilization plan. However, military authorities say that this move is just a test to ensure the smooth implementation of future mobilization laws.

### United States Prepares to Send Ship to Japan to Evacuate All Nationals

United Press, Washington, 5th. The Maritime Commission said yesterday that the emergency fleet under its jurisdiction could carry all the stranded American nationals in Japan back to their home country when the State Department deems it feasible. Since Japanese ships cancelled voyages to the United States, many American nationals have been stranded in Japan. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull said that he was studying this issue, but he pointed out at a reception for reporters that he had previously advised American nationals to leave the Far East as early as possible while transportation was still available.

### Japanese Spokesman Discusses Soviet-Japanese Relations

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. An Information Bureau spokesman told reporters today that negotiations with the Soviet Union regarding the Fisheries Bureau boundary issue and various other negotiations are still in progress. As for commercial matters, they must be submitted to the Privy Council for approval. Asked about commercial talks between the United States and the Soviet Union, the spokesman replied that Japan did not want to interfere in the United States' policy towards the Soviet Union. Someone asked whether Japan would take the same attitude towards the United States' policy towards Europe. The spokesman replied in the affirmative, but with reservations, namely, that the United States' activities are limited to Europe and do not extend to the Far East. If it involves us, we will consider it.

### Japan and Dutch East Indies Adjust Trade; Understanding Said to Have Been Reached

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. A "Yomiuri Shimbun" reporter in Batavia reported that, according to some sources, Japan and the Dutch East Indies have apparently reached an understanding on adjusting trade relations and may transport goods through ports of both countries on a mutual assistance basis according to temporary measures.

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told reporters today that when asked about the Batavia news carried by "Yomiuri Shimbun" that Japan and the Dutch East Indies have apparently reached an understanding, Ishii replied that Japan and the Dutch East Indies do not want to stop trade with each other and are willing to continue operating in accordance with the agreement. This method must be discussed. Although the Dutch East Indies has frozen the assets of the Japanese following the footsteps of Britain and the United States, according to observers unrelated to both parties, the Dutch East Indies has demanded independent action. Although the volume of trade cannot be expected to remain the same as in the past, the Japanese Consul General in Batavia is currently discussing trade issues with the Dutch East Indies authorities, including the oil issue.

United Press, Batavia, 5th. It has been learned today that Japanese ships loaded goods in the Dutch East Indies today that had been paid for before the freezing order, including oil, but in very small quantities. It is said that special notices have not yet been issued, but the Ministry of Economic Affairs is expected to take measures soon.

### Japanese Ship Tatsuta Maru Leaves America to Return Home; All Cargo Seized

United Press, San Francisco, 5th. The repeatedly delayed Japanese mail ship "Tatsuta Maru" left here yesterday with 350 passengers, mostly Japanese nationals, but no cargo. The ship was loaded with 1,577 barrels of machine oil, for which the Washington Export Control Committee issued export licenses.

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. Information Bureau spokesman Ishii stated today that if it is deemed beneficial from a commercial point of view, Japan may resume shipping to the United States. The Japan Mail Ship Company's "Tatsuta Maru" has been released, but the cargo it carried has been seized by the US authorities. Now, other ships will wait for the outcome of this case to determine their actions. Asked about future commercial relations between Japan and the United States, the spokesman replied that we are not optimistic. Although freezing assets does not completely stop trade, if the situation worsens, there will be no trade to speak of. Asked whether Japan would take retaliatory action against the United States regarding the "Tatsuta Maru" case, the spokesman replied that we will consider this point if necessary.

### United States Actively Proceeding with Ship Building Program; Thirty-Four Ships Completed Last Month

United Press, Washington, 5th. The Navy Department announced yesterday that 34 warships were launched last month, and 63 keels were laid down. The warships launched included one cruiser, three destroyers, and five minesweepers.

Editorial

### From Conquest to Breakthrough

The German-Soviet war has been going on for six weeks. The boast made by Germany beforehand that it would resolve all Soviet military organizations in six weeks has now become a shattered illusion. Moreover, judging from the situation, not only is it impossible for Germany to defeat the Soviet Union fundamentally, but even if it wants to turn to another path, break out of a bloody road, or retreat to a defensive position, and maintain some of the war results that the Nazis have gained in Europe in the past two years, it has become a big problem.

Hitler's ambition to control the world is unprecedented, and his blind faith in the omnipotence of force is also unprecedented. Because of this, he invented the so-called "blitzkrieg," appearing everywhere with a do-or-die attitude. If he cannot win thoroughly, he will only suffer a complete defeat from the root. In the past two years, the German army has created many brilliant achievements in Europe, each of which is a concrete explanation of a thorough victory and a rapid victory. However, in this German-Soviet war, the situation it has encountered is not only different from the several major wars in Poland, Northern Europe, and the Balkans, but is also completely different from the major war against Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands in Western Europe. In the past, it almost always won in one battle, and it had never heard of so-called "first offensives" and "second offensives." However, in this war against the Soviet Union, even the first large-scale offensive was completely thwarted, and it is said that a third massive offensive is currently being prepared. What is noteworthy now is that its attacking power is obviously weakening with each offensive. And what is questionable is, how many more major offensives can its resources and total strength still allow it to launch? Once Germany realizes and admits that the offensive is futile, and once its resources and total strength do not allow it to continue the offensive, inevitably, it will only retreat and take a defensive position, or turn to another path, and concentrate its efforts to attack one or two military and economic key points, trying to break through the encirclement.

Therefore, if the news circulating in the past two days that the German attack has focused on the southern route to Ukraine is not too early, then the German authorities may have reached the point of admitting that resolving the entire Soviet army is impossible, and are trying to break out, which is not impossible. Moreover, the so-called third full-line offensive that is said to be in preparation may not appear immediately. This will form a large-scale breakthrough battle that has never occurred in history.

The significance of Germany and Italy choosing Ukraine as the path to break through, economically, is of course to seize all the abundant resources such as local agricultural products and oil, and to further plot the Middle East and India. Strategically, it is to break out of a bloody road, hoping to pass through the relatively weak corner of the British, American, and Soviet fronts, and reach the goal of joining hands with their Eastern ally Japan through the Middle East and India, cutting off the land connection between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, thereby encircling the Soviet Union. The overall goal, of course, is to try to break through the layers of economic and military blockade and encirclement laid down by the three countries of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, hoping to save their inevitable fate of defeat. Correspondingly with Germany and Italy attacking Ukraine, Japan also launched an offensive against Southeast Asia in the East, and after occupying all of Vietnam, it is actively pressing on Thailand. Although the distance between the eastern and western invaders is still very far, now that they realize that it is hopeless to defeat and conquer the anti-aggression front of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union individually, it is inevitable that they will jointly carry out a final breakthrough. And the relatively empty zone from Vietnam all the way to the Middle East is of course where the coveted goals of the invaders lie.

Until now, although the British, American, and Soviet responses to the eastern and western aggressive forces inevitably have different degrees of importance, the encirclement and blockade circle against Germany and Italy, economically, has reached a point of complete tightening and is very tight. Militarily, it has also reached the point of not hesitating to use all its strength and advancing towards the goal of thoroughly defeating Germany and Italy. As for Japan, economically, it is now only limited to partial actions such as freezing funds and stopping cargo transportation. Militarily, all arrangements are still focused on defense, and temporarily there may not be an active offensive. However, in terms of nature, military and economic aspects are equally important, and justice and aggression absolutely cannot coexist. In both the East and the West, there is no difference at all. Even if the Pacific War does not break out, once the Western invaders are defeated and the just forces jointly build the world, the fate of the Eastern invaders will be self-evident. Faced with these two encirclement circles, if the invaders want to save their common demise, of course, they can only attack Ukraine and threaten Turkey separately, as well as invade Vietnam and oppress Thailand.

However, the possibility of the invaders' breakthrough and the success of their attempt to actually merge is very small. As for the West, how will Germany and Italy succeed or fail in attacking Ukraine and threatening Turkey? Even if they concentrate their forces to attack this corner, the Soviet Union can of course take the opportunity to launch a major counter-offensive all the way from Minsk. Britain and the Soviet Union can cooperate in attacking the Baltic Sea and the Nordic countries. Britain can begin a counter-offensive on the European continent, or even Britain and the Soviet Union can jointly attack the Balkans and cut off the road from Germany and Italy to Ukraine. All these can turn Germany and Italy's dreams of entering the Middle East into dust. As for the weakness of the military power of the Eastern invaders and the depth of their economic dependence on foreign countries, it determines that any adventurous attempts of theirs are bound to fail.

In short, the external conquest and expansion of the aggressive forces has completely become a thing of the past. In the future, there will only be breakthroughs or retreats, and the result will be failure. Now that the anti-aggression front has been formed, any selfish or destructive actions have now disappeared forever.

### England and America Continue to Pressure Japan, Strengthening Their Position in the Pacific, Forcing Japan to Fight to the Finish, Various Dangers Can Be Cleared Away, Victory in the War Against Japan is Closer

Chongqing – The optimistic sentiment among Chinese regarding the early conclusion of the Sino-Japanese war has been growing in tandem with the increasing pressure exerted on Japan by England and America, and the continuous flow of supplies from the United States and the Soviet Union into China. It is generally acknowledged that the Soviet Union’s resistance against Germany has been crucial in strengthening England and America’s position in the Pacific. Since Germany’s military and political victories in France, the Balkans, and the Near East, England and America have had to focus their full efforts on dealing with the European situation, forcing London and Washington to adopt a policy of appeasement to avoid immediate conflicts in the Pacific. Many people frankly expressed concern in the early stages of the German invasion of the Soviet Union about the Soviet Union's ability to contain the German forces. The collapse of Soviet resistance would have strengthened Germany's position in Europe and Japan's position in the Pacific. England and America, in this situation, would concentrate their efforts on defending the British Isles, hoping the war would prolong. However, the success of Soviet resistance has changed the situation in the Pacific. Now that Germany is mired in the war, this is a golden opportunity for England and America to shift their focus to the Far East and eliminate all sources of danger in the Pacific in one fell swoop. Many signs indicate that England and America are now forcing Japan to fight to the finish in the Pacific, such as the freezing of Japanese assets, the abrogation of commercial agreements, the American oil embargo against Japan, the arrival of large numbers of British land and air forces in Malaya and Burma, and the strengthening of Philippine defenses by the United States. These are recent developments that demonstrate a new trend in England and America's Far Eastern policy. Chinese officials believe that whether Japan attacks the north or advances south, it will risk war with major powers. The final outcome may be determined within a year. At the same time, China's military position has been greatly strengthened by the continued arrival of supplies from the United States and the Soviet Union. Although government officials have so far refused to comment, according to reliable sources, not only are American planes transporting supplies to China, but also a large number of volunteer pilots are coming to China.

### The Ministry of Finance Unified Tax Collection Agencies, Determined to Extend to All Cities and Counties, Each County and City Established a Tax Bureau to Collect All Kinds of Local Taxes

Chongqing – The Ministry of Finance has unified the tax collection agencies this year, and each province has achieved one bureau per province. It has now been decided to extend this to all cities and counties, with the central government establishing a tax bureau in each county and city to collect all kinds of local taxes. However, land tax and deed tax will be temporarily collected by the Land Tax Administration established by the central government. After the consolidation is completed, it will be handed over to the tax bureau. The same is true for other national taxes. When people pay taxes, they pay into the national treasury or the county and city treasury according to the nature of the tax. If the tax is jointly owned by the national and local governments, it will be paid to the national treasury, and then the national treasury will allocate the stipulated portion to the county and city treasury. According to financial circles, this move is not only intended to unify tax collection agencies, but the central government can also control all tax revenues from now on. (Fifth dispatch, Havas)

### Chen Jie Talks to Reporters, Staff of the Embassy in Berlin Have All Been Evacuated, More Than a Hundred Students Remain in Germany, German Cultural Institutions Promise Economic Assistance

New York – Chen Jie, former ambassador to Germany, recently met with a reporter from the Central News Agency and said that the Chinese government's swift decision to sever diplomatic relations with Germany because Germany recognized the Nanjing organization greatly shocked German officials. In general, people from all walks of life in the German military, political, and financial circles expressed regret over the severance of relations between the two countries. The general public was even more surprised and deeply saddened by Germany's recognition of the Nanjing organization. Chinese people are still respected by Germans. Many families of high-ranking German officials, including those in the financial world, invited Chinese diplomats to farewell banquets, indicating that there are currently strong pro-China elements in the German government. Japan spent a lot of effort in asking Germany to recognize the Nanjing organization. Germany's recognition of the Nanjing organization was not out of special love for Japan or hatred for China. It was a temporary expedient because Japan's ambiguous attitude had caused anxiety in Germany. When asked about the internal situation in Germany, Chen said that Germans are confident that they will win, and as long as the German army wins, the people's will can be maintained. The military supplies and food that Germany takes from various occupied countries are not enough to meet Germany's needs, and it is now encountering a financial crisis. Chen also said that the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Berlin and the consulates in Hamburg, Vienna, and other places have now all been evacuated. At present, there are still 1,150 overseas Chinese living in Germany, including 150 students. German cultural institutions have promised to provide economic assistance to this group of students. When the staff of the Chinese Consulate in Vienna were evacuated via Lisbon, Striese, a member of the former German military advisory group to China, helped a lot with transportation. The consulate staff praised Striese very much. Chen expressed his gratitude to the American government for providing the "West Point" ship for use by Chinese diplomats. Regarding the diplomats in Italy, only the staff of the Embassy in Rome and the Consulate in Milan were evacuated. The exact date of the diplomats' departure from the United States to return to China has not yet been determined. (Third dispatch)

Vichy, United Press, May 5 – The Vichy government yesterday assured the United States that it would refuse to cede French military bases to Germany or other powers. Vichy also said that Dakar "is in a state of full defense." Newspapers in Paris under German control warned Vichy that unless Vichy agrees to "political and economic cooperation to defend French colonial territories, as in the Far East," Vichy will face "tragic consequences." The Paris newspaper said that there should be "rapid changes in personnel and methods" in the Pétain government. "Paris Works" reported that when U.S. Ambassador Leahy spoke with Pétain and Darlan last Friday, he "suggested that the United States help France resist Germany and defend the African empire."

However, there was indeed a plan to visit the wartime capital of China, but the trip was canceled due to important matters elsewhere. (Fifth dispatch, Reuters)

### Germany Replenishes Military Supplies, Prepares to Launch New Offensive; Soviet Resistance Strengthens, Progress Difficult; Finnish Troops Also Fail in the Ladoga Sector

Reuters, London, 5th. A dispatch from the Swedish capital states that German sources continue to report that German forces are destroying the resistance of surrounded Soviet troops on the two major fronts of Smolensk and Kiev, and are continuing to advance eastward at different speeds. The purpose of the German message is clearly to give the impression that the German army is now holding its acquired positions, or is advancing, and has not been forced to retreat. The German side also stated that the surrounded Soviet troops must be dealt with, and that the slow advance of the German army allows the lagging infantry to catch up. A military correspondent for a newspaper in the Swedish capital stated that the German side has now completed its arrangements in the rear areas, allowing the exhausted troops to rest slightly, reorganize the damaged units, repair mechanized combat equipment, and mobilize fresh troops, preparing to resume the offensive. However, this pause will also benefit the Soviet army. According to a dispatch from the newspaper's Berlin correspondent, the German side said that the quality of the Soviet reinforcements is inferior to that of the Soviet troops who fought in the initial battles. Military experts predict that the German army will soon launch a large-scale new attack, aiming for Leningrad, Moscow, Kiev, and Odessa. Currently, Finnish troops are still trying to break through the area between Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega. If successful, they could cut off the Soviet Union's transportation route to Murmansk. If Finnish troops make progress in this area, they can put pressure on Leningrad from the east. However, the Soviet army has not carried out any destructive actions in Sortavala, which proves their determination to hold the city and prevent the Finns. Only artillery activity continues on the island of Hango. It is reported that Soviet troops are constantly arriving on the island of Hango, indicating that the Finnish attempt to starve the Soviet garrison has failed. According to a report from Sulik, the German Frankfurter Zeitung reported that Moscow has begun evacuating men, women, and children who are unsuitable for work, and is strictly prohibiting refugees from using railways and main roads, using the experience gained in the French war, in order to avoid hindering military operations. Also, the Soviet newspaper Pravda stated that the German army attacking the Soviet Union is two to three times larger than the Red Army stationed on the border. It is estimated that the German side has mobilized 30 divisions (approximately 500,000 people), 10,000 first-line aircraft, and 15,000 tanks. However, facing fierce Soviet resistance, the talk of the German army achieving amazing victories on the front line is now unheard of. Instead, the excuse is only that annihilating the Soviet army is more important than occupying land. The newspaper continued that the German side failed to destroy the Soviet air force first, and the German mechanized forces failed to achieve their goals. This was the German side's biggest miscalculation. The German army has suffered heavy losses, and morale has inevitably declined. The German advance eastward has not only failed to advance directly but has instead encountered death and destruction. Although the final outcome cannot yet be determined, fierce fighting is still ongoing. However, the Soviet army's resistance and counter-offensive power are indeed becoming stronger day by day. According to Finnish news received in Vyborg, fierce fighting continues around Sortavala at the northern end of Lake Ladoga. The Soviet troops in the area continue to contain the Finnish army's resolute attacks, and Soviet tanks are constantly counter-attacking. The city of Sortavala is a strong stronghold on the flanks of the Finnish army attacking along both sides of Lake Ladoga. The Soviet garrison in the area has received reinforcements. The network of fortresses built by the Soviet Union in the area ceded by Finland last year is centered on Sortavala. The excellent artillery of the defenders and the dangerous terrain are also of great help. Moscow Radio stated that large numbers of wounded German soldiers are currently being sent to the occupied areas for treatment. There are 18 to 20 trains a day carrying wounded soldiers arriving in Germany.

United Press, Moscow, 5th. The pressure of the German offensive towards central Ukraine along Korosten, Belaya Tserkov, and in various directions north and south of Kiev, continued for the third day of major fighting yesterday. Marshal Timoshenko, who commands the entire western front of the Red Army south of Estonia, is putting up a strong resistance with his troops. At the same time, in the fighting around Smolensk for the past 18 days, the Soviet army has launched repeated counter-attacks, attempting to destroy the German army's salient positions. Fierce fighting continues and has yet to stop. Only minor skirmishes have occurred on the Finnish and Bessarabian fronts.

### Soviet Garrison in the Karelian Isthmus Prepares to Launch Offensive Against Finnish Troops

United Press, London, 5th. News arriving here today states that Soviet troops, under the command of General Stern, former commander of the Far Eastern Army, are preparing to attack the Karelian Isthmus between Keksholm and Raasuli on the southern shore of Lake Ladoga. The news also stated that according to air force reconnaissance reports, multiple trains carrying military supplies are traveling between Leningrad and Finland, and large Soviet forces are concentrated behind the old Murmansk front line. It is reported that Finnish troops have moved to the front line and are proceeding towards the defenses of the isthmus to deal with a possible Soviet attack. According to news arriving here, at the beginning of the war, it was generally estimated that the Soviet army had gathered a million troops on the northern front, while the Finnish army had 300,000 and the German army had 100,000. It is reported that half of the Soviet troops in this area will face the threat of 200,000 Finnish troops in the Karelian Isthmus. The news further stated that General Stern's offensive will determine the outcome of the battle for Leningrad. The news also stated that the Soviet army is prepared to attack the northern shore of Lake Ladoga, indicating a desire to defend the Murmansk Railway and the Stalin Canal.

### British Military Observers Believe Actual War Has Just Begun

United Press, London, 5th. Some well-informed British army observers believe today that the real Soviet war is now beginning, and that the operations of the past six weeks were only the opening of a large-scale war. At the same time, according to information from this source, the Soviet Union may have transferred its second-line troops to the areas of the Polish Corridor and Bessarabia, and deployed its well-trained and equipped Red Army to defend its initial defenses along the old border. This superior army is currently fighting the German army in Smolensk, Leningrad, and other places. However, as both sides are currently deploying fresh troops, there may be even more fierce fighting in the next six or eight weeks. No one can know the outcome of this battle, as no one knows how the heavy losses on both sides can be replenished, and no one knows what kind of stockpiles both sides will use in this war.

### Mussolini Makes Grandiose Claims, Says Victory in Anti-Soviet War is Inevitable

Reuters, Rome, 5th. The Italian official news agency stated that Mussolini gave a speech yesterday in the Mantua area to a regiment of Italian Blackshirts sent to assist on the Eastern Front. The struggle between Fascism and Bolshevism has finally arrived. You are honored to participate in this great battle. The people of the world have been approaching this severe test for twenty years. Will the victor be Fascism or Bolshevism? This will be decided here. The struggle for which we have prepared for many years has now entered its final stage, and this great drama has now reached its fifth act. The division between the two sides is now complete. On one side are Weimar, Berlin, and Tokyo, and on the other side are London, Washington, and Moscow. We will surely win, because history shows that all people who represent past ideas will fail, while those who represent future ideas will win. Those who will fight alongside you on the Soviet front are not only German comrades, but also Finns, Romanians, Slovaks, and volunteers from other countries. I believe that you will fight with determination and courage. Remember this saying: anyone who hesitates in war will fail.

### German Planes Raid Suez Area; Malta Also Attacked

Reuters, Berlin, 5th. The German official news agency stated that on Sunday night, German planes attacked the Suez Canal area, and one 10,000-ton merchant ship and one 8,000-ton cargo ship were hit and sunk. In addition, at least one passenger ship of 20,000 tons was hit and severely damaged.

Reuters, Malta. The official report stated that Malta issued alarms twice on Sunday night. A small number of enemy planes flew in and dropped bombs. One plane was caught in a searchlight and hurriedly dropped its bombs, causing slight damage to civilian houses, but no damage to military buildings. There were also no casualties among the soldiers. Furthermore, enemy patrol fighters flew near Malta yesterday morning. Seeing British fighters taking off to intercept them, they immediately fled. A large church in a densely populated area was recently indiscriminately bombed by enemy planes and damaged by bombs.

### British Troops in Tobruk Attack Enemy Forces

United Press, Cairo, 5th. Yesterday's general headquarters communique stated that the British vanguard troops in Tobruk were very active. The communique stated that the British vanguard in Tobruk continues to advance and attack. Although they have achieved some important victories and destroyed enemy minefields, the enemy forces have apparently refused to make contact and have retreated in the night.

Reuters, Cairo, 5th. A communique from the British Middle East Air Force Command stated that South African Air Force bombers fiercely attacked enemy positions in Tobruk on Sunday, with dozens of heavy bombs hitting enemy artillery positions. British Air Force and South African Air Force fighters carried out offensive patrols in the skies over enemy-occupied areas. On Saturday night, a large British Air Force heavy bomber force fiercely attacked the port of Benghazi, causing a large fire, and one bomb hit an enemy anti-aircraft gun crew. Anti-aircraft guns and searchlights at the Berka airfield were also strafed by low-flying British planes. On the same night, British naval aircraft bombed the enemy airfield at Gambut. On Sunday, British planes attacked several Italian fighters at the Italian airfield of Riccio. Where the bombs landed, fragments of Italian aircraft flew high into the sky. Many Italian aircraft were destroyed. All British planes returned safely.

### A Visit to Chongqing, the Mountain City, by Mr. and Mrs. Luce, Authorities in the American Publishing World (Part Two)

Two

I slept very comfortably in the Kong residence, and had coffee and milk for breakfast. At ten o'clock, Weddy White and I went to Foreign Minister Wang's residence for a purely introductory visit. We returned at half-past ten, and as the car was driving on the bustling street, Weddy suddenly said: "There's an air raid." I didn't feel anything, but he had noticed that people on the sidewalk were starting to run away. I immediately noticed that everyone was running very fast, and the shopkeepers were rushing to close their doors. We all went into the room, and everything was very quiet, but the servants were already packing our luggage in our room. We immediately rushed to the street as quickly as possible. At this time, the whole city was evacuating. The street in front of the Kong residence was crowded with people from the civilian areas. Everyone was carrying suitcases and belongings, and even more people were carrying babies and fleeing the alarm. The older children walked on the road more calmly. As we turned a corner, we saw a very orderly stream of people gradually pouring down the mountain. When we reached the main street, traffic was terribly congested. Car horns beeped intermittently. Trucks and crowded cars kicked up dust.

At this time, the first alarm had already sounded, meaning that Japanese planes had left Hankou an hour ago and were now flying into Sichuan. The planes might not go directly to Chongqing; we would have to wait for the second alarm in half an hour to be sure. The American embassy across the river was about to host a banquet for us. Dr. Kong specially sent a secretary to take care of us and asked us to hide in the air-raid shelter. But Weddy knew there was still plenty of time, so we took a detour to the riverbank dock.

A steamboat that didn't look very big agreed to take us across the Yangtze River, but after reaching the other side, the steamboat didn't take us to the embassy, which was another mile downstream. The steamboat went straight to the shore and left us on the wide sandy riverbank. A very polite guard asked us to run a little further away from the sandy shore. Another guard told us to go even further. Weddy then said, "Ah," and the guard said to us with joy, "The Chairman is coming soon."

Sure enough, two steamboats approached the dock—the first one was larger, and twenty people in plain blue-gray clothes jumped off the boat and stood on both sides of the path. A dazzling car was waiting there. Then, from the small steamboat that had just taken us across the river, came a slender figure, wearing a felt hat and a black semi-uniform outfit. He walked with a light, orderly pace, tapping his black cane with each step. As he walked, he slightly raised his hat. We saw him nod his head, and he immediately got into the car. A minute later, we were riding the steamboat of Asia's greatest leader since Kangxi 250 years ago, heading downstream.

As we traveled in the river between the towering mountains, we could see many people on the Chongqing side going to the caves to take shelter. At the embassy dock, Major McHugh met us, and he was surprised by the steamboat we were riding and the direction we came from. We got into sedan chairs and immediately noticed an American gunboat docked in a rocky harbor. The size of the harbor was just enough to accommodate the gunboat. (To be continued)

### The Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks Entrusted to Manage Foreign Exchange

American Government Issues Notes to the Four Banks Limited to Unfrozen Portion of Exchange

Since the US and UK successively issued orders to freeze Chinese and Japanese funds, American and British banks in Shanghai have been instructed to implement the freeze. In order to maintain legitimate trade, special notes have been granted to fourteen banks, including Citibank and HSBC, to sell foreign exchange to meet the needs of importers and exporters. A reporter from the New Voice Press learned yesterday from the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks that the US government has recently issued special notes to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, allowing them to buy and sell foreign exchange on the same basis as the fourteen friendly banks. The British method has already been sent to the Shanghai branches of the four banks at 2 pm yesterday by the US Consul General in Shanghai, based on the consultation to the four banks' head offices. The provisions of this consultation are the same as the general notes No. 58 and No. 59 previously issued by the US government, but its scope is limited to the unfrozen portion of foreign exchange receipts. As for other Chinese merchant banks engaged in foreign exchange, they are also included. Chinese funds in the United States that have been specially approved by the Chinese government are not subject to this restriction. The detailed contents of the four banks' entrusted foreign exchange management measures by the US government will be officially announced at a later date.

Continued Supply for Legitimate Needs

The Russian New Life Newspaper reports that since Japanese funds were frozen, the UK and the US, at the request of the Chinese government, also froze Chinese funds. Chinese and foreign people in this city are still closely watching its development. Our reporter visited Mr. Kann, a famous economist and monetary expert here, to ask for his opinion on the future of Shanghai's finances. The reporter first asked what impact the freezing of Chinese funds would have on the Chinese economy. According to Mr. Kann's reply, due to the short time, it is still impossible to observe the results of the implementation of the freeze in the future. The reporter then asked what new measures the banks in this city would adopt to implement this order. According to the reply, the banks are strictly implementing the new regulations, but it seems that the supply to the legitimate needs of the business community in this city will not be suspended at this time. As of now, US dollars deposited in banks by private individuals can still be withdrawn, but the US dollars are paid at the market price converted into legal tender.

Living Expenses Are Also No Problem

As for how to handle the issue of "reciprocal" British pounds, some banks have asked London for instructions on how to prevent capital flight. Detailed instructions were received the day before yesterday (the 4th). According to these instructions: (1) those who can prove their use for legitimate import purposes; (2) those who have documents proving that they are being shipped to China, can apply to the bank for approval to supply foreign exchange, and there is no reason to refuse. In addition, if they rely solely on this foreign exchange deposit to maintain their livelihood, they can be satisfied to some extent. It is also not difficult to obtain foreign exchange for gold pounds to pay insurance premiums and remit them abroad for education expenses. This method is also applicable to US dollars.

The Status of Legal Tender is Increasingly Consolidated

Speaking of this, the reporter continued to ask about the impact of the freezing order. He said that this move is particularly beneficial to legal tender, because US dollar depositors in various banks are rushing to sell US dollars and easily obtain legal tender. However, due to the unstable international situation and the increase in "embargoed" items abroad, the import side of this city has fallen sharply. In conclusion, Mr. Kann mentioned the future of legal tender. It is said that the status of legal tender will remain as solid as ever, and there are various signs that it can be asserted that it will be further improved.

### Taikoo's Northern Shipping Line, S/S Shuntien, Requisitioned by Government Order

Only S/S New Peking Remains on That Route; Fewer British Ships, American Ships Continue to Pass

Foreign shipping on the Yangtze River route has been suspended for more than four years due to the impact of the Sino-Japanese War. British ships on the northern and southern shipping lines still maintain normal operations, but British ships sailing to ports in North China are often harassed by the Japanese.

Quarantine Suspension

Recently, the S/S Shuntien, the regular ship on Taikoo's northern shipping line, was originally scheduled to load passengers and cargo in Shanghai at noon on Saturday (the 2nd) and sail to Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Tianjin. Before leaving, it suddenly received a notice from the Customs Quarantine Office that passengers traveling to North China must be examined by the ambassador. The ship then suspended its export and went through quarantine procedures, with the top fixed departure at noon on Monday (the 4th).

Requisitioned by Telegram

Unexpectedly, the doctor's certificate was not issued at that time, so it was changed to leave port at 5 pm. At that time, the doctor's certificate was not issued again, so the company reported that it would be changed to start at 10 am yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, a telegram was suddenly received from Hong Kong yesterday morning ordering the requisition of the ship, and the ship was declared to have suspended its sailing to North China. More than 600 passengers were notified to register and refund their tickets. This time, the ship was loaded with tea, corn, native paper, piece goods, cotton yarn, etc., which will be taken out within a few days. Once the goods are unloaded, it will sail south to Singapore in response to the call.

Only One Ship Remains

The Taikoo company's northern shipping line originally had the S/S Shengking and the S/S Shuntien operating on the route. The S/S Shengking was requisitioned to Singapore in March of this year, and the S/S New Peking was transferred to replace the S/S Shengking to operate on the northern shipping line. Now the S/S Shuntien has been requisitioned again. Afterwards, the Taikoo company's northern shipping line only has one ship, the S/S New Peking, operating on the route. Whether the company will transfer another ship to take over has not yet been indicated. The S/S New Peking can return to Shanghai from North China today and is scheduled to sail to Tianjin on the 9th, also calling at Weihaiwei and Yantai.

Baohe Shipping

Also, due to the European war, the ships belonging to the British Baohe Shipping Company's Far East line only go as far as Hong Kong, and no longer come to this city. Mr. N.H. Lacey, the manager of the company, will also be leaving Shanghai soon to return to England to serve in the military. The day before yesterday (the 4th), he issued a notice to the relevant business firms, stating that the company's office will continue to operate as usual, but the duties of the manager will be entrusted to Mr. S.C. Smith, manager of the Poulson & Davis firm at Beijing Road, to act as agent. The firm has accepted the invitation, so a joint notice was issued the day before yesterday regarding the above. British ships in the Far East are gradually decreasing, while American ships on the Pacific line are still maintained, and cargo ships continue to arrive in Shanghai. There is a mail ship from the United States arriving in Shanghai about every eleven days, and the next day it goes to Hong Kong and Luzon. Another ship, the President Coolidge, goes from San Francisco to Hong Kong, and then directly to Luzon. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Luzon via Hong Kong next Tuesday, and return to the United States the next day. Japan is not clear.

### Jurisdiction over Route Bay Sz Chung, etc. Transferred to Foch Police Station

Effective August 3rd of this year, the segments of Route Bay Sz Chung, Route Mai Chi, and Road Geh Loh within the jurisdiction of the Betong Police Station of the French Concession are transferred to the jurisdiction of the Foch Police Station. Therefore, if residents in the above segments have any incidents in the future and need to contact the French Police Station, please contact the Foch Police Station at 307 Road Geh Loh (Telephone 70160).

### Japan Seeks to Seize Mineral Resources in Central China

Due to the lack of domestic resources, the Japanese are attempting to seize various military raw materials in various parts of Central China to prolong their war machine. Recently, Tai Tian Quai, director of the Central China Liaison Office of the East Asia Institute, went to inspect the Lei Ye, Ma'anshan, and other mining areas for "development." He was accompanied by Bun Do Ching Hsiung, director of the Technology Department of the East Asia Institute. According to the Japanese Xinlu News, Bun Du has recently returned to Nanjing and made a statement. According to the investigation, "The iron ore at Daye, Ma'anshan, Tao Chong, and Phoenix Mountain is of extremely good quality, exceeding general expectations. Among them, the iron ore at Ma'anshan in particular, has an iron content of 60%, which is truly the world's unparalleled high-quality ore. If it can be electrically extracted, then the coal and iron in Central China can be self-sufficient. The East Asia Institute will implement technical improvements and step up mining based on the results of this inspection in order to achieve mass production."

### Mobil Oil Tanker Detained by Japanese

Sailing to Shiyi Xu in Jiangbei, Detained by Japanese Warship and Escorted Back

British ships sailing along the Chinese coast are often discriminated against by the Japanese and subjected to inspections, detentions, and various kinds of harassment. Even American ships are afraid of the difficulties. Recently, the American Mobile Oil Company's small tanker, the Mayao, loaded oil in Shanghai on the 19th of last month and went to Shiyi Xu in Jiangbei, downstream of the Yangtze River, to unload. It arrived at its destination that day. There was fighting in the area, so it could not unload the goods and immediately returned to Shanghai. On the way, it encountered a Japanese warship, underwent inspection, and was escorted to the outer reaches of the Wusongkou for surveillance. It entered the port in the morning on Saturday (the 2nd) and docked at the Mobil dock, but was still under surveillance by Japanese soldiers.

### French Concession Public Transportation Resumes Two Routes Yesterday

Armed police escorts protect the vehicles; Further negotiations by the authorities are expected to resolve the issue.

Following a labor strike by workers of the French Power and Water Company demanding subsidies, which began the day before yesterday, the company, in order to maintain transportation within the concession, resumed service yesterday on Routes 1 and 7 tram lines, with armed police escorts provided by the French police. The political department of the French police and other departments have taken measures to mediate further and have advised workers to resume work first, pending a reasonable solution. The details are as follows:

Forced Resumption of Service

After the work stoppage by workers in the Vehicle and Machine Departments, all tram and trolleybus lines and public buses within the French Concession were completely suspended. At the same time, the vehicles of the British tram company in the Public Concession temporarily suspended entering the French Concession. In order to maintain transportation within the concession, the company authority first resumed service yesterday on Route 1, from the Sixteen Pups to Route Ferguson, and Route 7, from the Sixteen Pups to Avenue Haig at Route Tenant de la Tour, with two armed police escorts assigned to each vehicle by the police. As for the remaining tram lines and trolleybuses, and public buses on Routes 21 and 22, the company also plans to selectively restore service on important routes.

Efforts to Mediate

The political department of the French police and other departments advised workers to resume work first, pending a reasonable solution. Yesterday, the authorities held talks with representatives of the workers to negotiate a solution. After reaching an agreement with the workers, they will then negotiate with the company's director. It is reported that the point of contention in this labor dispute is the issue of subsidies and is not particularly serious. The workers believe that if the company agrees to increase subsidies, they will resume work. Since the company has accepted the principle of increasing subsidies, this work stoppage is not expected to escalate and can be resolved.

A Genuine Misunderstanding

Recently, newspapers reported that the Shanghai French Tram Company had increased the salaries of its Chinese employees by 15% in July, while the salaries of its French employees had increased by 50%. This difference in treatment seems to be the main reason for the workers' dissatisfaction, leading to this strike. In fact, this is due to a misunderstanding. For the benefit of the public, it seems necessary to clarify the truth, as this will be beneficial to the efforts to resume work. The resumption of work should be supported by all three parties involved: the public, the workers, and the company.

Salary Increase Percentage

The salary increases for French and Chinese employees in July were based on different items. In terms of temporary proportional subsidies, it could be said that one side was increased by 50% of the base salary, while the other side was increased by 15% of the base salary. However, it should be noted that when comparing the total amounts added to the salaries of Chinese and French employees, the total amount of salary increases for both sides was actually 10%.

Sympathetic Consideration

Furthermore, when the workers decided to strike, the company authority had already declared to the labor union that it was willing to give sympathetic consideration to another salary increase for Chinese employees. The company authority has not changed its position on this point. As such, since this strike is detrimental to the prosperity of Shanghai, it should be resolved immediately.

Police Escorts

The French Power and Water Company includes tap water, electricity, trams, and public buses. Although all workers in the Vehicle and Machine Departments are on strike, causing trams and public buses to stop running, there is no fear of interruption in the supply of tap water and electricity generation because foreign workers are still working. The French power plant in Zikawei has been heavily guarded by a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives and French troops to protect it. Substations along the roads are also guarded by armed police. Detectives are also stationed in front of the company on Route Cardinal Mercier to provide protection.

### Yang Mei-nan's Funeral Held Yesterday

Mr. Mei-nan Yang, former Chinese General Manager of the British Swire Company, passed away at his Shanghai residence on the 3rd of this month. His funeral was held at the Chinese Funeral Home yesterday, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has now been learned that Mr. Yang only recently converted to Christianity. Therefore, the funeral yesterday was conducted with Christian rites and was exceptionally solemn. Mr. Yang had a wide circle of friends during his lifetime, and hundreds of people attended to pay their respects. Mr. An Xianjin, the director of Swire Company, also came to offer condolences. Swire Company and all its ships continued to fly flags at half-mast yesterday in mourning.

### Ministry Order: Special Reserves to Be Implemented for All Industrial and Commercial Sectors

Special reserves to be set aside in addition to public reserve funds to protect and consolidate all sectors during extraordinary times.

In order to protect and consolidate industry and commerce, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has formulated the "Measures for Special Reserves for Industry and Commerce in Extraordinary Times," and has issued orders to chambers of commerce in various places to instruct all trade associations to comply with them.

### Bloody Incident Occurs in the HSBC Building This Morning. Japanese Insurance Company Tea Boy Forms a Gang to Commit Murder. Accountancy Intern One Killed and One Injured.

This morning, a major bloody incident occurred suddenly in Room 144 of the HSBC Building at No. 12 The Bund. Room 144 of the building is the Kobe Shanghai Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., a Japanese company. It employed Mr. Qian Defeng, a Ningbo native, as an accountant. Mr. Qian lived in Nanshi, but recently, due to the closure of the iron gate in the French Concession, Mr. Qian temporarily lived in the company and shared a bed with Mr. Cao Wenfei (18 years old), a local intern. At 3:30 this morning, when Mr. Qian was still fast asleep, Mr. Ding Changrong (24 years old), a Yangzhou native who worked as a tea boy in the company, and his elder brother, Mr. Ding Changqing (26 years old), carried sharp knives and iron bars, sneaked into Mr. Qian and Mr. Cao's bedroom, and without asking any questions, stabbed wildly at the bed in the darkness. Mr. Qian and Mr. Cao could not avoid the attacks. Mr. Qian was stabbed seven times in the head and once in the abdomen, while Mr. Cao was stabbed twice in the chest and abdomen. Blood flowed all over the bed.

After Mr. Qian was seriously wounded, he still forcefully grabbed Mr. Ding Changrong and shouted for help. Although he managed to struggle free, neighbors in the building heard the screams from the room and, knowing that a tragedy had occurred, got up and went to investigate. They also turned on the lights and realized that there had been a murder. At that time, Mr. Qian and Mr. Cao were unconscious on the bed due to their serious injuries. The neighbors and the building watchman saw that the Ding brothers were stained with blood.

They were suspicious of their appearance. They went forward to inquire. At that time, Mr. Ding Changrong alone claimed that a thief had broken in to rob, but everyone had doubts and knew that the two must be the murderers. They reported the matter to the police station in charge, and detectives arrived to send Mr. Qian and Mr. Cao to the Renji Hospital for treatment and rescue. They also found bloody knives and iron bars in the room, as well as carefully observing that Mr. Ding Changrong and Mr. Ding Changqing were also slightly injured. The Ding brothers and Mr. Sun Sheng, a Jiangbei native who worked as a servant in the company, were taken to the

Police station for investigation. Regarding the bloody incident, it was heard that Mr. Ding had previously stolen items from the company and was reprimanded by Mr. Qian. Mr. Ding then conspired with his elder brother to commit murder. (Mr. Ding Changqing had recently come to Shanghai from Pukou and was staying at his brother's place.) In the dark, they could not recognize the target clearly, causing Mr. Cao to suffer an innocent disaster. It is said that the police station is currently investigating the case. Mr. Cao Wenfei died at 4:00 PM due to his serious injuries.

### Finance: The Freezing of Foreign Exchange Was a Big Deal, But In Reality It Was Underhanded: Speculation Was Still Possible, But General Prices Rose Significantly Because of It

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC list all exchange rates as stable. The black market rates for US and British currencies gradually returned to their pre-January 26 levels, before the US and UK simultaneously froze Chinese and Japanese funds. Chinese and foreign speculators only needed to borrow the name of a certain foreign firm or company to continue their activities. New transactions were opened for the September British and US currencies. The freezing of foreign exchange, which was originally a big deal, allowed buying and selling on credit to continue in secret. The general price level, however, rose significantly because of it. Mobil Oil also had buy-ins. Although foreign banks had supplies for sale, they inevitably raised prices, resulting in the US dollar opening at $5.21875 in the morning. It soon became difficult to close, trending towards weakening. Chinese speculators and importers intensified their activities, tending towards buying, causing HSBC's small counter US dollar rate to shrink to $5.125. The US dollar was supplied at $5 for larger settlements. Therefore, there was talk that foreign banks would maintain the above price in the future. The price gradually tightened until the market closed, a significant squeeze compared to the previous day. Trading became more active.

Speculators are Unusually Active

Since the foreign telegrams indicated that silver had shrunk and that the US and UK were stable, the exchange rates of various countries remained unchanged. The central listing of various exchange rates remained stable. At the start of the domestic market, banks were selling spot British currency at a flat 3/8d per 1.09375 and the US dollar at $5.21875. Mobil Oil was reported to have come to settle for the August US dollar at $5.21875, and it immediately became difficult to close, trending towards weakening. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was still at 24.25%. HSBC's small counter US dollar rate remained at $5.1875. Chinese speculators were even more active, using the names of importing merchants to buy British gold at 3/8d per 1.09375 and the August and September US dollar at $5.1875. There were quite a few new transactions. Robbie was also reported to have bought in. Most foreign British and American banks sold out. The situation stabilized at midday, with British gold closing at 3/8d per 1.09375 and the US dollar at $5.1875.

British and American Currencies Both See Tightening as a Result

In the afternoon, importers bought even more aggressively, causing HSBC's small counter US dollar rate to shrink by .0625 to $5.125. Speculators were also buying in secretly. Later, it was reported that HSBC had shrunk the rate for larger settlements to $5, and the market tightened even further until the 3:30 PM close. Spot to September futures were British currency at 3/8d per 1.0625 and the US dollar at $5.125, which was tighter than the previous day's closing price by 0.046875 for British currency and 0.09375 for the US dollar.  Inclined toward Gold, Competing for the Throne; Highest Price Seen Was $8,550

Yesterday, the black market for bullion was quiet, but the situation suddenly became active because there were new transactions being made for the current September foreign exchange, and because speculators were buying due to the tightening trend. It was also rumored that Hong Kong telegrams were maintaining the local US dollar rate at only $5. People from all sides suddenly felt excited. Exchange houses and securities firms were actively buying, followed by gold firms. Therefore, the price rose from $6,696, gradually reaching $6,770. Later, Xinfeng Yongfu and Xiangxing Yong sold out, and the rising trend subsided, eventually seeing an increase of $67. The whole day's trading became active, totaling 50,000 to 60,000 taels. Spot soared again. In the morning, the silver house sold 50 taels to the securities house, priced at $8,400. Yuhao sold another 30 taels for $8,430. A certain silver house and Dafeng each sold 30 taels of Xinfeng Yong for $8,450. At noon, Chengji sold 50 taels of silver houses, priced at $8,430. In the afternoon, Chengji sold another 100 taels to Yida and 40 taels to Hesheng, priced at $8,430. Later, there were fewer sellers, and the price soared again. Tong Kang Yong Jin Chi Da sold 10 taels for $8,550, an unprecedented peak. Later, there were buyers at $8,500, an increase of $140. Jewelry also rose by $15, totaling $870.

Futures Soared by $67

Since the opening of the market for each bar (10 taels) at 9:15 AM was $6,700, $9 higher than the previous day's closing price, Xinfeng Yong, Dafeng, Yida, and Defu bought in due to the tightening of foreign exchange, and it immediately rose by more than $20 on the market. At around 10 o'clock, it rose to $6,726, as Xinyuan and Chengji sold out. It immediately fell back to around $6,715. Around 11 o'clock, Litai, Yida, and retail investors came to sell, falling another $20, entering the $6,700 range, falling to $6,696. However, because foreign exchange was slightly loose, Dingsheng, Dafeng, and Tong Kang Yong absorbed, and retail investors dragged in, rising more than $20 to $6,720. There were many floating positions selling out. At noon, the market closed at $6,712. The market opened at $6,715 at 2 PM in the afternoon, which was $3 higher. It then fell slightly back to $6,705. Suddenly, Yili, Xianghe, Yida, and Decheng were inclined to push aggressively, and it was heard that foreign exchange was tightening, with rumors that the local US dollar rate would be maintained at $5 in the future. People's hearts were greatly encouraged, and the price rose by more than $60 in a consistent buying trend, reaching $6,770. Afterwards, Dingsheng, Xinfeng Yong, and Xiangxing Yong vigorously sold, and the rise stopped a little, falling back by $20 to $6,750. The market closed at $6,758 at 3:30 PM, a sharp increase of $67 compared to the previous day. Based on the settlement price of the August US dollar at $5.12, it was $6,795, with a spread of $3-$7. Gold from the company's own brand and retail prices were $8,550, with the purchase price being $200 lower than the selling price.

Jewelry Listed at $870

The selling price of jewelry silver per tael was initially listed at $55 by Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang. It rose by $10 at 11 o'clock and by another $5 at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, totaling $870, an increase of $15. The purchase price was reduced by $40, it was said.

### Most Foreign Currencies Rose, Few Fell

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw both spot and futures for bullion rise. British and American gold pounds also rose by $5 each. The trend of British gold notes was stable, and the market price remained stable. US dollar notes opened at $1,924. After the opening, Yintai and Xiangxing bought, raising it to $30. Rentai and Yongxing sold out, falling to $23. At noon, the market closed at $67. The market opened at $26 in the afternoon. After the opening, Tongxing, Dongsheng, Hengxiangyuan, Yongshunfeng and others bought, raising it to $41. Rentai Yong sold out, falling back to $1,938 at the close, an increase of $18 compared to the previous day. Spot also rose to $19.25. Hong Kong notes were trending firm and the market was steady. Canadian and Australian gold notes were both trending upwards. Japanese and Korean gold notes both fell slightly. The former retreated to $2.18, while the latter fell to $1.74.

### Securities: Many Short Covering in Public Bonds, with a Rebound of Around $1

In the unofficial market for public bonds, the market continued to trend upwards yesterday, with the momentum increasing. In reality, most were short covering transactions. Very few were new longs, and there was almost no activity. As the market price rose due to short covering, floating longs took the opportunity to cash out. The market price had risen by two dollars and several cents in three consecutive days, and short covering transactions were gradually feeling satisfied, especially in the afternoon. The price continued to rise by around $1 in one day. Be careful of the reversal. In the morning, Dafeng, Yizhong, and Fengji were short covering in the front, and Pinhe, Jiufeng, and Gongmao continued to cover in the back. Lianyi also bought in slightly. Dechang, Dazhong, Jiucheng, and Xiexingyuan sold out at high prices. Hongda, Yichang, Runde, and Yitai also sold out. The market closed well at 67 cents. In the afternoon, Lianhe and Jiufeng continued to cover short positions, while Tongkang, Xieda, Runde, and Tiansheng absorbed accordingly. Grade C even raised the $68 barrier. Yiji, Renfeng, Tongxing, and Xiexingyuan sold out at high prices. Jiucheng also continued to sell out. Originally a short position on the table, it has turned into a long position on the table in three days. As a result, the market price continued to rise by 7 cents to $1.20. The turnover was $2.34 million. A brief table is listed below.

In stock trading, 50 shares of the Commercial Press were traded, priced at $95.

Also, the opening of the stock market in the Public Industry Institute was stable, but then it fell back again due to rumors, and the closing was still firm. There were quite a few transactions throughout the day. The Xiangtai stock fell back from $93.5 to $90.5. Rubber stocks remained stagnant.

### Yarn and Cotton: Long and Short Positions Abound in the Industry; Yarn Market is Expensive and Soft; Actual Sales Do Not Seem to Be Thriving

The yarn market is rising after hovering, but the trend is wavering again. In reality, the current yarn sales are not strong. The Hong Kong gangs only handled 60 bales of 32-count, 40-count, and 42-count yarn and thread. Only 20 count yarns were packed, so the price of Shuangma Factory's single is quite high. Those selling short are not very active, but securities gangs are slightly dragging in to see the rise. As for the industry, both long and short positions abound, so the market is expensive and soft. Some people also say that if the Shuangma Factory's single is around 1,600 yuan, those selling short will be more active. Therefore, there may be a struggle at the 600 yuan mark. However, the price of yarn and cloth at the current exchange is very firm due to more buyers than sellers, which affects the Shuangma Factory's single. The high price of 20-count Shuangma was $1,590, and the low price was $1,560. The initial transaction in the afternoon was $1,572, gradually falling to $1,564. Afterwards, the bid was good, and it immediately rose to $1,585. The final price was $1,580.

Shuangma's opening in the morning was well received, with many buyers. The first lot price was $1,580. It soon rose to $1,584.5. The market stood at this level for a long time, but sales for the Guangdong gang were sluggish. There were no transactions for 20-count yarn, and only a few bales of 32-count and 40-count yarn were handled. However, the long position on the table was quite strong, gradually rising to $1,590. Unexpectedly, as soon as the high price appeared, rumors resurfaced, and the exchange price fell by more than $10 at the same time. The market was filled with selling voices at once, falling by 20 to 30 yuan, and the low price saw $1,560. However, those who profited took the opportunity to buy in, and it rebounded to $1,572 at the close. The statistics for the transaction volume in half a day totaled 7,560 bales. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below:

Hong Kong 60, counterparts 7,500

Statistics 7,560

The situation of the futures yarn market for Jinshuangma: The market opened in the morning, continuing the rising trend of the previous day. Gold firms and securities firms unanimously bought in, with each of the August and September contracts rising by $4 and $2 respectively. After the opening, there were still many new buyers and short covering, with August once reaching as high as $1,460, September at $1,534.5, and October at $1,512. After the entry, there was a widespread rumor of a conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union, and many longs began to sell. August fell to $1,448 again, September at $1,518, and October at $1,526. Gradually recovering slightly, the midday close saw August fall by half a yuan, September fall by $5, and October fall by $5.5. The transaction volume was 12,090 bales. The market was still weak in the afternoon. After the entry, new buyers and short covering were eager again, and the price rose again, with the rebound in August being the largest and the remaining months slightly easing. The evening close saw August rise by $7 from the previous day, September rise by half a yuan, and October fall by half a yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 18,000 bales, an increase of 5,850 bales compared to the previous day. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the day are recorded on the left (nominal bid prices).

### Cotton Market Remains Good

The current cotton situation still has a firm appearance, but factory demand is not very developed. Cotton merchants are unanimously upward-minded, so the situation is relatively good.

Another message: Although the international situation is still quite tense, the foreign cotton order transactions in Shanghai are somewhat enthusiastic due to the scarcity of cotton from the United States and India and the overseas cotton market being very firm. Apart from the relatively weak orders for Brazilian cotton yesterday, the purchase of Indian cotton was very enthusiastic.

The New York cotton market rose first due to industry buying, but then fell back due to selling by the Southern gang and profit-taking by longs. As a result, the closing price was down 11-12 pounds compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market fell first due to selling by cotton merchants and profit-taking by longs, but then rebounded due to short covering and buying by spot merchants. As a result, yesterday's closing prices rose by 5-6 robis for most months, except for White Locke, which fell by 1 robi for the July-August period. The opening market is predicted to be down 2.25 robis today.

### Piece Goods: Large Quantities of Cloth are Shipped to Hong Kong; Sales Prices are Raised Again

Factory cloth: The market rose because large quantities of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong, and purchasing by dyeing factories and customer gangs increased. Factory hands were very tight, so the sales prices of spot goods were raised again. White fine cloth and twill rose by about 50 cents per bolt, coarse cloth rose by 25 cents per bolt, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 50 cents. More than 800 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled more than 600 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth. Nanyang gangs handled more than 300 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, twill, bleached cloth, and other items. Beilu Yanjin gangs handled more than 200 pieces of woolen cloth, coarse and fine cloth, and other items.

Eastern cloth: The exchange first weakened and then rose yesterday, with a firm trend, while the spot market continued to rely on real demand, with prices continuing to rise. White fine twill rose by 15 cents to 50 cents per bolt. Longtou fine cloth rose by 15 cents, closing at $52.75. The popular coloured goods, Four Gentlemen Serge, saw a particularly strong rising trend due to scavenging by the Tianjin gang and this street. New tax new bill has gradually risen to $1.74, new bill old tax $1.7275, old bill old tax $1.6775.

### Grains: Government-Sold Rice Enters the Market; Rice Prices are Difficult to Raise

Yesterday, foreign rice gradually trended downwards, with both futures and spot goods declining, down by a small amount of $2-3 compared to the previous market. The current inventory is sufficient, and new arrivals are constant. All of the Java, Kofu, Burmese, and Siamese rice that was previously ordered in June and July will be arriving in Shanghai. It is difficult for floating longs and retail investors to store large quantities, so they are continuously selling out in the market. New hoarding is stagnant, and actual sales are weak. There is Hong Kong-Vietnamese government-sold rice on the market on this street, lacking appetite. The ball-rolling gangs also lack the opportunity to manipulate the market, so the market price cannot be supported and is falling. Yinghua’s broken rice has declined from $104 to $103. Grade 2 Siamese rice is currently $136, with futures at $137-138. Xiaojiao spot is $146.5, with futures falling from $146 to $145.5. The close was $2-3 lower than the previous market. Grade 1 Saigon Gao ranged from $131 to $129, Grade 2 $120, old $124, Grade 1 Siamese $126.5, Chong-1 $120, Grade 2 $117-118, Min Dang Gao $130.05, Jue $122, $120, Kofu rice $126-127, Xiaojiao Bank Wharf initially $120, then only $118, outside wharf from $119.5, then to $117, Jue $115-116, broken tip $91, $90. More than 7,000 bags of spot rice were traded, with 700 tons from Yinghua.

Thick and thin japonica rice is also experiencing sluggish sales due to high prices and continued strong supply. The selling intention is soft, and a declining trend continues. Early and late rice from Nan Gang opened at $150 to $147, a huge drop of $3. The Wuxi original package white japonica rice, however, is holding up better due to scarcity, only depreciating by $1. It opened at $145. Glutinous rice is also softened by the impact of various goods. Hong Kong white opened high from $124-125 to $120, national glutinous rice $125-126, glutinous green beans not opened.

Pudong's new japonica rice has already been launched, totaling seven stone. It is sold by Wufengtai Factory after milling. It opened at $156. However, the rice sample was first released to promote sales in advance. Yesterday can be called the true market. Although there was a lack of water this year due to the Geng year rains, the quality is still not bad, similar to last year. It is said to be 80% of the normal year's yield.

### Flour Prices Decline Slightly; 6,000 Bags of Foreign Flour Continue to Arrive

Yesterday, the flour market continued to decline because the customer appetite remained quiet and hoarding households were not interested. However, the Jinlong flour was more active in trading, opening at $31.5 and then sharply declining to $31.1. Therefore, hoarding households came to ask about prices and took advantage of the low price to absorb, gradually recovering to $31.5, still a small amount of 10 cents lower than the previous day. This flour was $34, with no other transactions.

In addition, foreign flour continues to be shipped in. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang ship docked at our wharf on the Bund of the French Concession yesterday afternoon, bringing 6,000 bags of flour shipped from Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Rebounds

Yesterday, coarse white rebounded because it had fallen for several consecutive days, with the drop reaching $4-5, and the price position was gradually suitable. It is normal for the price to rebound after extreme fatigue. The company's futures for 24 coarse white with a maturity date of August 10 was initially $100.009, then rose to $101.5, and then returned to $100.05, eventually rising to $101.2, $102, $102.2, $101.8, $102.3, an increase of $1.55. The maturity date of August 20 at $101.9, $102.9, $101.9, $102.9, and then rising to $104.45, and then slightly loosened to $103.5 and $103.65, an increase of $1.15. The public association spot 24 coarse white for July arrivals at $101.8 and $103.5, an increase of $2.5, June at $100.3 to $101.5, corrected $103, May at $100.005, $101.3, and $102.5, all rising by $2.

In addition, 300 bags of sugar were imported on the 5th, shipped from Hong Kong.

### Silk and Tea: Japan Freezes Raw Silk in the Occupied Areas; The Silk Industry is Dying Out

Since the freezing of funds, the overseas market for raw silk has stopped trading. Although there have still been sporadic transactions in the Shanghai silk market this week, the question of whether this raw silk can be exported is still a problem. According to a telegram from Tokyo yesterday, raw silk in Central China was also frozen and not allowed to be exported. According to reliable sources, small silk mills in the Hangjiahu area of the interior have now been closed, and Central China has also stopped buying local silk. This news may confirm that the above telegram will become a reality. Therefore, the hope for raw silk exports from Shanghai is currently slim. Some wise people have developed in the free areas of the interior, so the silk industry in Shanghai and the occupied areas is hopeless, but the silk industry in the vast interior is thriving.

### Sugarcane and Cane Sugar (3) (China Section)

— Gao Jiannong

When did the Chinese people learn to make cane sugar themselves? According to the French Encyclopedia, "In ancient times, the Chinese also knew—previously India was mentioned, hence the addition of 'also'—how to extract the sugar content from sugarcane: because on very ancient ceramics, one can find traces of their syrup-making techniques." However, can we definitively say that these traces are from "sugarcane"? Or are they from the "Yi Tang" (饴餳), the maltose that the Chinese have known how to make since ancient times? It is difficult for us to determine. Moreover, the authenticity and dating of ceramics are highly debatable, so this passage is not credible. To be realistic: the era when the Chinese began to learn how to make cane sugar is recorded in authentic national history books. According to the "Tang Shu Xiyu Zhuan" (History of the Tang Dynasty, Records of the Western Regions), "Magadha (India), in the 21st year of Zhenguan—647 AD—first sent envoys to communicate with the Emperor. Emperor Taizong sent envoys to obtain the method of boiling sugar; and ordered Yangzhou to present various sugarcane, and the squeezed juice was processed according to the method, and the color was far better than that of the Western Regions." The Song Dynasty poet Lu You supplemented this memorable event in his "Lao Xue An Bi Ji" (Notes from the Old Learning Hut), saying, "Wen Renmaode said: Granulated sugar originally did not exist in China. During the reign of Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, it was presented as tribute from a foreign country. When asked of its envoys, 'What is this?' they said, 'It is made by boiling sugarcane juice.' Using their method, it was boiled and made, and it was equal to that of the foreign country." Therefore, the middle of the seventh century AD—around 650—is the true beginning of when the Chinese truly learned to make cane sugar themselves. However, what was made at that time was naturally the primitive, reddish-brown, coarse granulated sugar. (To be continued)

### The Problem of Student Conduct

— Qin Shouou

My writing relationship with Shen Bao has lasted for nearly a dozen years, so I often feel very concerned about everything about Shen Bao, especially its vigorous and energetic spirit, which makes me feel very happy when I think of it. This launch of the Shen Bao Student Aid Fund, its design is extremely thorough, and the measures are also very reasonable. Seeing the enthusiastic donations from all parties in the past half month is even more exciting.

My old friend Dr. Ding Huikang has no connection with Shen Bao, but he is naturally warm-hearted and willing to contribute money and effort to everything, so he has donated the most (including fundraising on his behalf). This matter has powerfully moved me. Although I am a destitute literary beggar with little strength, I can only allocate 30 yuan from the稿费 fees I wrote for "Autumn Begonia" last month as a donation, but my heart is equally boiling.

The income of writers is very meager, so I absolutely do not want other writers to follow suit; because relying on us to donate this little money is really too little! I only ask the speculators and wealth-makers to touch their consciences when they send stacks of new banknotes to singing and dancing halls, and donate half of it to the Shen Bao Student Aid Fund; given the number of people in Shanghai who are profiting from the national crisis, I dare bet my head that if they are all willing to "generously donate," 100,000 or 200,000 would not be a problem!

At the same time, I would also like to contribute an extremely important point to the gentlemen in charge of organizing: when approving student aid, student conduct must be listed as the first requirement. We see those male students dressed like foreign hooligans and female students dressed like dance hostesses in front of cinemas and dance halls, and we feel very sad in our hearts; and like a few days ago in the newspaper, there was a news story about three young students harassing a woman on the road and also injuring her husband, which is really too absurd! I dare not say that the conduct of every student in Shanghai is bad, but those who are both morally and academically excellent are truly rare – the schools do not pay attention at all – but we know that knowledge is like wings to a tiger for a person with bad character. If the money that everyone has worked so hard to donate is used to help young people with bad character to go to school, it would be too regrettable! Therefore, I sincerely hope that those in charge of this newspaper can pay special attention to this point! Of course, it is not enough to just pay attention to the individual actions of young people. On the one hand, we must urge schools to improve moral education.

Editor's Note: Mr. Qin Shouou generously helps students with his writing income, which is the best nutrient for cultivating students. We express our gratitude on behalf of the students. His opinion on student conduct can be said to be incisive and thought-provoking. This newspaper keeps in contact in many ways during the "academic" and "conduct" investigation of young people applying for student aid, and is not afraid to ask for details, so as to explore its depths; this is exactly in line with Mr. Qin's idea and can be used to question readers.

### Observations at a Teahouse

— Jue Hui

Thanks to a few self-proclaimed "progressive youth" friends, I "progressed" to a teahouse yesterday.

Not to brag, I have indeed been to a teahouse before; but because the previous time was "for business," I had never observed it. This time, since it was a "casual visit," I naturally put on the air of Ah Q admiring the little nun.

First of all, I noticed the people. It seems that the entire 20th century belongs to the youth. Usually, old men should go to teahouses, but regrettably, there wasn't even a slightly longer beard!

Secondly, I noticed the conversation. Forgive me, have mercy on me, I couldn't understand a single word! Some were not Chinese, I didn't understand; some were jargon, I didn't understand; some were "specialized names," and I still didn't understand...

Third? One of my "progressive youth" friends was furiously shouting "Stan Kang": "Little × is really not pretty, ××'s × sister is monopolizing one person to dance!"

The above three observations are all facts, I dare not fabricate rumors to "confuse the public." I hereby declare.

### How to Manage Fluorescent Lights

— Zhong Han

Fluorescent lights are not as simple and easy to manage as tungsten filament lamps. Careful switching is essential, otherwise the bulbs are easily damaged and expensive to replace. The following points are for users to pay special attention to:

(1) If both ends or one end of the bulb turn deep black, and sometimes many blackish-purple circles are found near both ends, the bulb is no longer usable.

(2) Sudden flickering of an old lamp is also a sign that the bulb is about to fail. For new or recently used bulbs, the problem must be in the starting mechanism, and a new switch should be used to replace it.

(3) After turning on the power, if the lamp does not light up or lights up slowly, the reason is that the lamp holder is loose, the contact point is not good, and the current cannot easily pass through. The lamp holder should be tightened.

(4) If the middle of the lamp is dark and only the ends are lit, the problem is that the starting small cylinder has lost its adjustment function.

(5) After prolonged use, thin, straight lines often appear on the bulb. This is because the mercury inside condenses when cold. Sometimes, when the bulb is emitting light, it encounters cold objects outside, and the mercury will condense. Black spots may also be found on any part of the bulb. The method is to turn the bulb 180 degrees and install it, so that the mercury can be heated and re-evaporated.

(6) If a half-inch-wide black circle suddenly surrounds half of the bulb at both ends or one end of the bulb, replace the starter quickly, otherwise the bulb will be damaged, because the starting current is too high.

Autumn Begonia's body swayed a few times suddenly, as if about to faint, panicking Mei Bao quickly climbed up from the ground and used all her strength to support him.

"Let go, let's talk while sitting down!" Autumn Begonia calmed down, and his anger subsided much more than before. But he did not dare to let go, and still supported him forcefully, helping him walk to a bamboo chair to sit down. She was busy squatting down to clean up the tile shards scattered all over the ground.

"Thank goodness you haven't written that IOU to him yet!" After the anger subsided, he seemed very tired and could only speak slowly in a very low voice, "Mei Bao, acting is not an easy way to make money. You are too young, you almost fell into their trap, don't go there again! You can eat any kind of food, but never eat the food of acting!"

He said the last two sentences almost word by word. Although his voice was very low, it was not difficult for Mei Bao to hear the pity in his heart.

"Now that my illness is cured, the younger brother of Little Dog is still helping in the theater, I can take care of myself at home..." He sighed deeply and paused for two or three minutes before he could continue: "Regardless of whether you can graduate next year or not, there are at least two more months left for this semester, you should go back to the city as soon as possible!"

After Mei Bao picked up the larger pieces, because there were still many brick chips and tea leaves scattered on the ground, she grabbed a broom and started sweeping. (177)

Here and Now

### First Day Selling Newspapers

— Xinghua

"Studying, what's the use of studying! I told you a long time ago to go to a foreign cloth store to learn business, but you refused. Now what! After graduating from high school, you can't find a job anywhere. If you do find one, it requires a deposit of one thousand yuan. If you had learned business back then, you could have earned some wages, and you could be a boss now. Hey! Ah Xing, don't think it's bad, you can only sell newspapers now to supplement the household."

I also felt ashamed when I thought about it. I had eaten white rice at home for more than ten years, and now that I had graduated from high school, I couldn't even find a small job. No wonder Dad was angry. However, I really didn't want to sell newspapers.

"Hey! Ah Xing, don't think that the occupation of selling newspapers is lowly. Haven't you heard of college students pulling rickshaws? I think you should listen to me. If there is a noble occupation in the future, you can still change careers. It's not good to eat your parents' rice for the rest of your life."

The next day, I took off my long gown, received dozens of newspapers, and ran around on the street. I hung my head, and my heart felt like it was pierced with swords. Glancing sideways, it seemed that everyone around was mocking me. My throat felt like it was blocked with a wooden block, and I couldn't shout. Other newspaper vendors were straining their vocal cords: "Old Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Zhongmei Ribao... Want to see the Soviet counter-offensive victory!" Business was naturally booming.

Suddenly, a streamlined car stopped beside me, and two people jumped out – a man and a woman. Alas! The man was my classmate Mr. Li, dressed in Western clothes. I hurriedly lowered my head, pretending to read the news in the newspaper.

"Hey! Do you have the桃紅色 "Peach Red" News?" It was his voice.

"Uh! No, no--" My heart was anxious, and my face was flushed.

"Then, do you have the ×× Movie News?"

"No, neither, neither--"

He said to the woman:

"This newspaper vendor looks strangely familiar. Where have I seen him before? Oh! I remember...."

If there was a hole in the road at that time, I was afraid I would have burrowed down.

"Hmph! Could this poor kid be your classmate? Don't daydream. Hurry up to ×××, I'm afraid we won't make it to the first show of ××× this afternoon!" The woman said. They got in the car and left.

Great benefactor! Great benefactor. If it weren't for this lady at that time, I don't know where my face would have been lost. I won't be able to repay this great kindness even if I am a cow or a horse in the next life.

I held a stack of newspapers and stood blankly on the street. I thought of the grand occasion at graduation. "Today is the fragrance of peaches and plums, tomorrow is the pillar of society."

Alas! Pillar?

### Returning Lost Items

— Yaoyao

A little urchin was using a key to open the back door of a family at the entrance of the alley.

"What are you doing furtively?" A policeman walked over and shouted loudly.

The little urchin said tremblingly, "Sir, I found a key here, and I don't know which family lost it, so I wanted to try it on the locks of each family so that I could return it to its original owner." After saying that, he gave a wry smile.

The policeman listened and said with a smile, "In that case, you still have the virtue of returning lost items!"

### Anecdotes

— Junjun

To be merely a clothes rack in front of a clothing store, there is no value to life. (George Bernard Shaw)

Walking through an open door is nothing extraordinary; breaking open a closed door is what is difficult and valuable. (Jean Racine)

### Nervous Breakdown

— Zhang Genyuan

My brain is sick, probably some kind of nervous breakdown.

All day long, I am using my brain, I am thinking, my brain often goes from slight flashes of pain to almost cracking open. I think too hard, that's for sure. It's only when you think too hard that it hurts like this. What am I thinking about all day long! It's all vague, empty. I don't know what kind of results I will think of. The result is just a severe headache. This is a nervous breakdown! For sure, otherwise, I'm being foolish. Why should I make my brain suffer like this?

I don't want to think, but I can't help but think. The price of rice and the price of coal have risen to eat people. In the past, I rarely bothered to use my brain, but now I want to think more to make it worthwhile, otherwise I'll be sorry for the expensive rice, coal, and everything else that has risen in price.

But a nervous breakdown is definitely a nervous breakdown, right? The sky won't fall, what's the use of thinking?

I am not as good as others, I only know how to worry about things. In this day and age, trying to make a living, it's no wonder I'm developing a nervous breakdown!

Daydreaming and nervous breakdown got married, alas!

Arts and Entertainment

### Liu School Laosheng Chen Hongsheng Comes to Shanghai to Perform

— Muyun

Today, when talking about Laosheng, almost all of them follow the Yu, Ma, and Tan schools, and the strengths of the three schools are almost the same in different ways, all of which are decadent and soft sounds. The tunes they sing are mostly modified based on their innate talents. However, recently, the situation has changed slightly, because decadent sounds imply signs of national demise, which are not as good as the majestic sounds of Huangzhong Dalu (Yellow Bell Great Lyu), which are enough to inspire people to reflect deeply. Most people who practice Yu do not have a good voice, so they use the sound of their dantian to devote themselves to unrestrained ups and downs. There is no one more skilled and extensive in this art, but there is no Bole in the world. How can a thousand-mile horse not be buried in the wilderness! My friends Yang Baosen and Tao Weichu are both the most diligent in learning Yu. What Yu sings is not only the rough outline, but almost every word of the Gongche, inside and outside the string, is also required to be accurate. Otherwise, they regard it as an insult to Yu. Their superstition is so deep. Until today, Weichu is still destitute, and Baosen's situation is not much better. It is not as good as Baozhong's knowing the difficulty and retreating, and using the Qin to live a comfortable and leisurely life.

In summary, it is not that Tan, Yu, and Ma are not worth learning, nor that learning them will ruin the voice. In fact, if one has talent, there is no need to be particular about Yu, Ma, and Tan. Gao Qingkui was known as a great hodgepodge. After Gao lost his voice, people realized the value of a voice. Song Baoluo performed at the Tianchan Theater, and the reason why he was popular was his voice. Song's voice is not complete in five tones. The high notes are more than enough, but the low notes are not round enough. What is even more Song's big problem is that he is not good at singing. When singing, he often has a feminine sound. Therefore, when Song performs, it is inseparable from his brother's Qin. Song's skills are not worth mentioning, but why is he popular? Are all the Zhou Langs in Shanghai laymen? No, that's not it. Song is popular because of his voice. The people of Shanghai have long heard the decadent sounds of Tan and Ma, and suddenly changing to Song's high-pitched voice, they feel a different flavor, so they all flock to it. Recently, I heard that the owner of Tianchan hired a Laosheng from the south. Who is this person? It is Chen Hongsheng, a giant in the Liu school. Chen is a second-generation disciple of Liu Hongsheng. His voice is even better than Song's, and his ups and downs are like Tan and Yu, but he does not lose the charm of Huangzhong Dalu. His style is close to Ma. All the dramas he can perform are the complete Liu's Three Chops and One Bump, which is completely different from Song. He has already led his sister Chen Guilan to the south. He arrived in Tanggu on the 4th, and will arrive in Shanghai tonight (6th). The date of his debut is probably not more than ten days.

### I Love "Border Town Story"

— Sha Fei

After watching "Border Town Story," what has been lingering in my mind are some floating shadows of the masses. The whole play is divided into five acts. The story is about a remote county town in the southwest border area. There are very rich gold mines there. Most of the local people use traditional methods to pan for gold to maintain their lives. The government wants to use machines to mine in large quantities. After many difficulties, they finally achieve their goal. In the middle, there are naturally clowns drilling and sabotaging. However, the influence of justice finally makes the masses take on their responsibilities and move towards the vast wilderness.

The first act is a scene of towering mountains and ridges. There are more than a dozen actors on the stage. Er Niuwa (Bai Chen), who is holding an axe, is standing on the top of the mountain, looking around. Tian Zhendong plays Wan Zhidada, and his makeup is the most fascinating to the audience. His face is majestic, his eyes are divine, and his chest is covered with black hair. His silly appearance is performed to the extreme. The villain Yin Xiaoshan (Han Fei) suddenly staggers out from backstage, shaking a cattail fan. His front teeth are protruding, and his speech is strangely sinister and interesting, especially the jump he takes before leaving, like a living monkey. The end of this scene is that Commissioner Yang (Chang Jun) brings Lao Gou (Shi Yuan) to the top of the mountain and is ambushed by the miners. He fights with Wan Zhidada, and as a result, Wan Zhidada suffers a little loss, thus sowing the seeds of enmity.

The second act is a bedroom scene. Yin Xiaoshan introduces Wan Zhidada's daughter Fengwa (Yingzi) to be an inside line. This scene is full of interconnected laughs. Shi Yuan's Shandong Mandarin is relaxed and funny, and Yingzi's teasing of Commissioner Yang shows the loveliness of a foreign girl everywhere.

The third act is a forest. Lao Gou gives Fengwa a photo. Later, Technician Zhang (Shen Cao) comes, and Wang Yiqing (Zhang Fa) also comes. The director's driving away of Shi Yuan and Ying is clever. With a "bang," the mine explodes. Commissioner Yang risks his life to rescue them. This scene is full of Yan Jun's enthusiasm, natural and lively, which is indeed commendable. The fifth act is on a wasteland. Dadouwai gathers the masses, and Yin Xiaoshan stands on a high tree, singing and playing by himself. Han Fei's every move is realistic, portraying the outline of a traitor, making people fascinated. The masses are deceived by Yin Xiaoshan and prepare to follow him. However, Er Niuwa rushes in with the murder weapon that Old Master Ba was secretly attacked with, and as a result, Wang Yiqing is tied up. Yin Xiaoshan walks to the door triumphantly. Commissioner Yang and Wan Zhidada rush back from the province. Yan Jun exposes the true face of the traitor, which makes the masses understand. So Yin Xiaoshan opens fire to demonstrate, and Fengwa shields Commissioner Yang with her body and is seriously injured. Wan Zhidada chases out and is also seriously injured, but Yin Xiaoshan cannot escape the circle of death. When Fengwa closes her eyes, she takes out a photo that Lao Gou gave her from her chest and hands it to Commissioner Yang, which means, "You must not forget that there is such an extraordinary woman in the world."

I love "Border Town Story" very much, and I would like to recommend this play to young men and women on the isolated island.

### A Record of Famous Amateur Performers' Charity Performance in Hong Kong

— Choucheng

There are more and more famous amateur performers from Shanghai in Hong Kong, including Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yuanlong, Xu Qinfang, Qian Liying, etc., more than a dozen people in total, both men and women, with Jing, Dan, Sheng, and Chou all available. Recently, initiated by Mr. Shen Qiuyan, in conjunction with Southern China movie stars Xue Juexian and Tang Xueqing and other famous amateur performers such as Yang Yihua and Cheng Jianxia, a charity performance of Peking Opera was held for two days. All ticket revenue was donated to the country for relief and disaster assistance. A preparatory committee was first formed, with Wang Xiaolai as chairman, and Wu Jiangfeng and Guo Yunfeng arranged the repertoire. Mr. Shen is skilled in Xiaosheng, and his wife is skilled in Qingyi, studying the Cheng School, which is absolutely divine-like. The husband and wife sing together, which is admired by everyone. At the opening of the night show on the first day, Mei Lanfang was invited to reveal the curtain, adding a lot of color. The performances included Lin Daji's "Bie Yao," Zai Huazhen's "Xue Li Saves the Emperor," Zhang Hua Jin Chongtao's "Empty City Stratagem," Ye Shun'sheng Qian Liying's "Hitting the Fisherman and Killing the Family," Chen Yousheng Zhang Yingming's "Pearl Curtain Village," Li Yunchu's "Cosmic Wind," Xue Juexian's "Chasing Han Xin," Xu Qinfang Tang Xueqing's "Fourth Son Visits His Mother," and Shao Dabao (playing Su San) and Shen Qiuyan (playing the prison guard)'s "Su San Qijie," which attracted the most attention. Coupled with Cao Zhigong's Chong Gongdao, it was even more hilarious. The next day, at the daytime performance, Zhang Yizhai and Ge Futian performed "Cutting the Yellow Robe," with equal skill and strength. Wu Jiangfeng, Zhong Qiying, and Lu Zhiqing's "Yellow Crane Tower" was also quite hard-working. Sun Wanpu and Chen Xiangtan performed "Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao," which was激昂慷慨 and exciting. The final show, Xue Juexian (playing Zhang Jiaxiang) and Wang Yuanlong (playing Xiang Daren)'s "Three Versions of Iron Rooster," were giants from the north and south film circles, with great differences in their styles, and the applause was thunderous. At the night show, Shen Beiping and Jin Chongtao's "Golden Terrace," Wu Hesheng and Zhong Gen's "First Righteous Deed Treasure," and Wang Yuanlong and Zhong Qiying's "Jizhou City" were all flawless. However, Li Shengsheng and Xu Qinfang's "Catching and Releasing Cao" were the most popular. It is said that Mr. Li has lived in Beiping for a long time and is friends with Hou Xirui, Liu Yanting, Jiang Shaoqiu, Liu Lianrong, etc., so he knows many plays. Ms. Xu has received careful teaching from a certain famous actor, and she is proficient in all Laosheng plays, with a reputation for correct pronunciation, clean voice, and clean movements. Two difficulties were combined, complementing each other, and the final show, Xue Juexian (playing Guan Gong)'s "Ancient City Meeting," was both singing and acting, perfect in every way, so the overseas Chinese were all very happy after reading it.

Twenty-seventh Xiao Changhua

Xiao Changhua, nicknamed Ershun, is a clown. In recent years, clown talents have declined, and Changhua has accumulated capital and prestige, so he is regarded as the spiritual light of the Lu Temple in this field. Changhua's plays are humorous and joking, not as good as the late Zhang Wenbin, but more broad and profound. He has been a teacher at the Fu Liancheng Peking Opera school for a long time. Today, most of the disciples who graduated from Fu Liancheng are his students. Although Changhua practices the clown role, in the school, Sheng and Dan also receive his teaching. Changhua's square-hat clown is quite famous. Tang Qin in "Stabbing Tang" and Jiang Gan in "Stealing the Book" are especially famous at the time. However, listening to his plays, there is no scholarly air and little restraint. It is only slightly better than Wang Changlin's vulgar crudeness. Where there is a lack of cinnabar, red soil is precious. Those who talk about clowns still have to mention Xiao Ershun first, which is also a little bit of the rise and fall of the past and present!

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 14: Yuan Yuan's Delicate Handwriting on Exquisite Silk

It was the weather of late spring, the third month, when the grasses of Jiangnan grew lush, and various flowers blossomed into trees. The gentle, bright sunshine illuminated the fields, which were wrapped in green, red, yellow, and purple hues, resembling a colorful carpet of brocade and clouds. The orioles in the sky flew and sang with melodious delight, chanting the spring of the earth. On a stretch of clear water in Hengtang outside Suzhou City, with fragrant orchids lining the banks for ten miles, a scholar's boat glided leisurely amidst the green mountains and clear waters, heading towards Yin Yan. In the front cabin of the boat, there was a Wu Palace beauty of seventeen or eighteen years old, with her hair styled in a swirling cloud, dressed in exquisite silk and jade sleeves. Her figure was exceedingly graceful and alluring. She peered out from the window, gazing at the opposite Lion Mountain. Her face was like an egg, neither too fat nor too thin, but plump, fair, and radiant. Her delicate eyebrows, melting autumn waters, a nose like fine jade, cheeks like peach blossoms, complementing a small, round mouth—truly, adding an inch would be too long, subtracting an inch would be too short. It was as if Heaven had deliberately used its ingenious craftsmanship to create this charming and beautiful girl from the spiritual essence of mountains and rivers. In this era of war and chaos, she would enact some soul-stirring, bone-consuming, sorrowful deeds, adorning a page in the history of the rise and fall of the nation, as it is said, "The bones of the entire family have turned to ashes, but the beauty of a generation shines upon the historical record." Beside her, standing shoulder to shoulder, was a handsome young man of about twenty, pointing out the nearby mountains and waters, laughing and talking. This pair of human lovebirds was no different from celestial immortals. Who exactly were they? At this time, although the beauties of the north were handsome, they could never match the alluring charm of the beauties of Jiangnan. Although the times were filled with turmoil and unrest, the pear garden opera troupes still performed with stringed instruments and clamorous music, pretending to be at peace. Allowing them to indulge in extreme luxury by the Qinhuai River and the Suzhou Terrace, with lit pavilions and boats filled with flutes and drums. (134)
