### Japan's Southward Ambitions Remain Unchecked; US Prepares to Send Fleet to Far East: The So-Called New Order Runs Counter to US Policy; British, American, Australian, and Dutch Cooperation Sufficient to Shatter Japan's Delusions

Washington: US Undersecretary of State Welles, when asked about reports that the US plans to move its fleet to the Philippines if Japan proceeds with its southward advance, declined to comment, saying only that such questions should be directed to the Navy Department. (United Press dispatch, 18th)

Washington: According to several newspapers here today, Washington officials are now considering not the European war, but the possibility of the US fleet appearing in the Far East to deter Japanese aggression. The "Washington Times" and the "Herald" both report that President Roosevelt is prepared to order the fleet to the Far East should Japan attack Singapore or attempt to occupy the Dutch East Indies. The tension in the Far East has relegated news of Germany's invasion of Britain to a less prominent position. Editorials also express the seriousness of the war spreading to the East. Although the outbreak of war seems to have been delayed, the crisis still exists and will continue to exist as long as the fundamental conflict of interests between Japan and the Western powers is not resolved.

The "Washington Star" commented on the situation in detail, stating that British Ambassador to the US, Halifax, said that the goal is to maintain the situation and prevent it from collapsing completely. But if Japan maintains its aggressive policies, which are detrimental to powers with firm stances, how can this goal be achieved? Unless one side concedes, conflict cannot be avoided. Currently, there are no signs of concession from either side, and the situation is undoubtedly extremely serious. No foreign ambassador has faced such a serious situation upon taking office in Washington as Ambassador Nomura does today. Does Nomura also realize this? US-Japan relations have become strained due to Japan's three-and-a-half-year attempt to conquer China, and further deteriorated due to Japan's open affiliation with the Axis powers and its desire to exploit the Tripartite Pact to advance its so-called "New Order." If Nomura comes to the US to promote a "New Order," he cannot hope to gain American sympathy, as Japan's aggressive policies are diametrically opposed to the principles upheld by the US. These principles include China's right to manage its own affairs, and the sacred right of equal opportunity, previously guaranteed by Japanese commitments and treaties. Japan must understand that only facts, not empty promises, can improve its relationship with the US.

The "Washington Post" also published an editorial stating that the Secretary of State's talks with the British, Australian, and Dutch ambassadors should serve as a warning to Japan, and make it realize that its dream of establishing an empire in Southeast Asia will be shattered. The alignment of interests expressed by the US, Britain, and the Netherlands will inevitably lead to unified action, the possibility of which is not welcome to Japan. The fact that Tokyo expressed great alarm at the end of this week is significant. Although the sudden specter of war with the US has crystallized anti-southward advance sentiment among the Japanese people, their desire for peace with the US is unreliable because the power to decide war or peace with the US does not rest with the Japanese people, but with the Japanese military clique. The only thing that can make the Japanese military hesitate is the reality that aggression in Southeast Asia will inevitably provoke strong resistance from all countries concerned. The US, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands should quickly reach a complete understanding to determine how to respond to Japan's southward advance threat. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Sino-Japanese War Related to Overall Situation: US Should Fully Support China; US Government Official Broadcasts Yesterday

Washington: Federal Security Administrator McNutt (former Governor-General of the Philippines) stated in a broadcast yesterday that the Sino-Japanese War has become a "preliminary action" for the defense of the Philippines' outer perimeter. McNutt stated that, given the nature of the Sino-Japanese conflict, China's victory is "inseparable from our hope for peace." He urged further economic aid to China to strengthen the US's own outer defense line. Colonel Roosevelt and author Chamberlain also broadcasted messages. During the broadcast, McNutt expressed regret that the Philippines had not yet been armed, while Colonel Roosevelt called on the government to declare its Far East policy. (United Press dispatch, 18th)

After a slight easing of the situation in Chongqing, the British suddenly advised their nationals to withdraw from the Japanese-occupied areas of China, without making any distinctions, and also laid mines near Singapore, which is quite unexpected. Although the situation remains serious, it is not too bold to speculate that Japan will not take irreparable actions before Germany achieves significant victories over the British Isles. In short, China does not fear any losses from Japan's various adventurous actions and is now quietly waiting for opportunities to respond to changes. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

### Soviet-Japanese Business Negotiations Reopen

Moscow: The Soviet-Japanese trade negotiations, which had been suspended since April last year, officially reopened yesterday at the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Moscow, Miyakawa, Chairman of the Soviet Foreign Trade Committee, Mikoyan, and Deputy Chairman Gaonovitz, held talks for an hour and a half. (Reuters)

Moscow: Soviet-Japanese business negotiations reopened here yesterday as a result of long-term efforts by Japanese diplomatic representative Tatekawa and others. Tatekawa submitted a plan for the exchange of goods, which the Soviet government will respond to tomorrow. The Japanese side here is very optimistic about the progress of the meeting. (United Press dispatch, 18th)

### Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Even Declares: Relying on Military Force as a Backing for Diplomacy; Aiming to Realize the Co-Prosperity Sphere Program

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, speaking before the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives yesterday, strongly urged the Japanese people to demonstrate their determination to establish a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and rebuked those within Japan who oppose the Tripartite Pact and those who belittle this determination and consider its declaration to be empty threats. Matsuoka also refuted the notion that Japan is exhausted from the war against China, and said that if the Japanese people do not express this determination abroad, he will not be able to conduct strong diplomacy. He is making every effort to use all peaceful means while preparing for the worst-case scenario, and the foundation of peaceful means is the establishment of a perfect national defense system. Diplomacy is ultimately military force, and diplomacy cannot achieve anything without military backing. The establishment of the "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is our belief, and we will never give it up no matter what. The entire Japanese nation should resolutely hold this belief, which is not based on empty hopes, but on the national strength to realize this great cause. This is the foundation of the diplomacy upon which the "Co-Prosperity Sphere Program" is based. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Japan Ultimately Unable to Conceal Fear: Accuses Britain of Creating Crisis in the Far East; Singapore Completes Defense Preparations

Tokyo: This morning's editorial in the "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that Japan is still calm as the midnight sea, but Britain is loudly clamoring about the seriousness of the Far East situation. The reason for this is puzzling. London has repeatedly warned that war in the Far East is about to break out, and Washington has reported that the US, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands are holding a joint Pacific defense conference. Although the contents of the meeting are unknown, it can be imagined that they are discussing concrete measures to deal with a Pacific war. The Singapore area is a major international trade route, and now Britain has laid mines here. Who, then, is responsible for creating the crisis in the Far East? (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Tokyo: According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the laying of mines near Singapore is sufficient to hinder Japanese shipping, and the impact on Japanese routes to India and Africa is particularly significant. Moreover, the area of these mines may be expanded, which can be regarded as a measure to blockade Japan. The "Hochi Shimbun" stated that Britain's defense preparations in Malaya should be regarded as a provocative act. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 18th)

Tokyo: The "Asahi Shimbun" recently reported that Ota, an employee of Mitsui & Co., has returned from Singapore. According to his account, the British authorities in Singapore are managing Japanese residents in an increasingly strict manner. Mines have been laid around the port, and forts and bunkers have been built along the coast. Each time troops are transferred, there is a blackout exercise for three or four days. After Japanese residents leave, they are not allowed to return. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

Tokyo: The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" stated today that Japan is willing to hold a world conference to end the current war. The newspaper criticizes Britain and the US for their unwarranted fear of the situation in the Far East and said that if the world's powers could come together, they would be able to solve all kinds of difficulties. (United Press dispatch, 18th)

### Philippines Determined to Resist Aggression; Governor of Burma Expresses: Sufficient Strength to Deal with Incidents

Washington: Eliserte, a Philippine expert in Washington, told a United Press reporter today that the Philippines will exhaust all of its resources to resist the Axis powers' New Order. (United Press dispatch, 18th)

Rangoon: Governor of Burma, Cochrane, stated in a speech today that Burma is confident that its own preparations, backed by the power of the Empire, are sufficient to deal with any attack. An attack on Burma would be an attack on the Empire, its full strength, and its allies. We in Burma are currently contributing to increasing the Empire's manpower. This work is quite significant, and progress has been made. The date of completion is not far off, which is something I find deeply gratifying. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Manchuria Implements Conscription System

Tokyo: Japanese Army Minister Lieutenant General Tojo announced to the Diet today that "Manchukuo" has implemented a national conscription system. The country's newly established military schools are developing rapidly, but the country's army is still unable to break away from Japan's leadership and become independent.

### Explosive Factors in the Pacific

Japan has now become the only disturbing factor in the Pacific, drawing global attention. However, according to Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi's explanation in Parliament the day before yesterday, this phenomenon is due to "excessive fear of Japan by the relevant powers; " and the source of this fear is entirely due to Britain "spreading false information, saying that Japan is preparing to advance south immediately." Therefore, he went on to advise the powers not to "overly fear" Japan, because Japan's southward advance emphasizes peaceful means, not the use of force, so as not to bring self-destruction, and so on. According to the London Sunday Times of the 16th, what Britain is currently most worried about is Japan being driven by Germany to form a strategic wing of the German-Italian-Japanese group, just like Italy did in the Mediterranean last year, and soon set off huge waves in the Pacific, coordinating with Germany's spring offensive, attacking Britain and the United States, in an attempt to reverse the common decline of this group. The newspaper then issued a warning: "If Japan wants to imitate Mussolini, it is best to carefully consider its own future destiny!" Therefore, the unrest caused by the Japanese factor in the Pacific today can actually be analyzed into three points: First, it is not because it immediately and actively attacks south, but because the German-Italian-Japanese group has become an unstoppable force, and it has no choice but to be carried along. Second, it is not because it has sufficient military resources and leisure to take risks while waging war against China, but because it has to make the greatest struggle to save its own and its allies' fundamental defeat. Third, the powers are not currently "afraid" of Japan, but merely worry about the further disruption of the entire Pacific situation caused by it.

From the first point of view, within the German-Italian-Japanese group, Germany undoubtedly occupies the leading position in terms of strength. Italy has long been unable to resist because of its geographical location directly under Germany's sphere of influence; even Japan in the Far East has to gradually follow Germany's lead; this is a natural law, the weak will eventually follow the strong. Moreover, since the announcement of the Tripartite Pact, the resources and markets of Britain, the United States and their colonies have mostly been blockaded against Japan; in the future, what it relies on, apart from raw materials, a part of which can be obtained from the Dutch East Indies, the rest of what it needs, assuming that Germany and Italy can find a way to supply, can only be maintained through land through the Soviet Union and the European continent. However, Germany and Italy can only supply very little, so Japan will eventually be unable to resist the economic pressure and naval blockade of Britain and the United States very quickly. Even in terms of Soviet-Japanese relations, Japan's only reliance now is Germany's mediation with the Soviet Union; recently, the Japanese authorities have repeatedly emphasized the necessity of adjusting Soviet-Japanese relations, attempting to ease the tension between Japan and the Soviet Union through Germany, in order to eliminate worries for the future and concentrate on advancing south; if this move does not succeed, then Japan still needs Germany to contain the Soviet Union from the west. Therefore, in terms of the situation, Japan is now absolutely unable not to closely follow Germany and Italy. London and Washington have recently telegraphed repeatedly that Hitler is exerting pressure, forcing Japan to attack British Far Eastern territories, coordinating with his own large-scale offensive, in order to disperse the strength and attention of Britain and the United States. What the powers are most worried about at the moment is mainly this, and not simply afraid of Japan taking risks automatically.

Second, Japan's "southward advance" has been a dream for many years. Before the outbreak of this European war, its greatest obstacle was the strict surveillance of European powers and the United States, which forced it to put it aside and first take risks against China. With the outbreak of the European war, it thought a great opportunity had arrived; but after self-reflection, it also realized that in the long-term war with China, its national strength had been greatly weakened, and all southward advance demands had become empty threats, with no strength to back them up. For example, last year's demands on Vietnam, although France had already been defeated at the time, openly resisted them, and the final acceptance was due to Germany's exertion of pressure after Japan joined the Tripartite Pact. For another example, Japan's current raw material panic has greatly increased its dependence on the Dutch East Indies. Thinking for it, it absolutely does not want war to break out in this area, leading to damage to materials. What Vice Minister Ohashi said is indeed from the heart. Therefore, in terms of national strength, Japan is currently only weakening day by day, and has never improved since any time after the outbreak of the European war, so why is the Pacific particularly tense now? The most important source of this is that Germany, Italy, and Japan, aiming at the United States' greatest possible assistance to various democracies, have no choice but to hope to defeat the various democracies first. Japan certainly has no choice but to start taking action in the East, but even thinking for itself, with US-Japan relations having completely no hope of improvement today, even if it dares not directly attack the United States, it is bound to attempt to preemptively cut off China's southwestern international transportation routes, so that all material assistance based on the "Lease-Lend Act" will not be able to reach China in the future. The best way to realize this attempt is, of course, to invade Thailand and threaten British Burma and India: thus stirring up the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, taking it as an opportunity to take advantage of. However, the attitude of Thailand in the end, and whether Thailand can refuse when Japan makes a request, are still questions. And once Japan rashly invades Thailand, and Britain and the United States react immediately, then the entire Pacific will immediately be engulfed in war.

Third, thinking for Germany and Italy, it is best for Japan to attack the British and American colonies; for Japan's own war against China, it should of course focus on the southwest of Asia. But no matter what, it has no way to directly attack the United States or attack the heart of Britain. At the same time, the fatal parts of Japan's own core are exposed to the possible attacks of the joint British and American naval and air forces. And in terms of the comparison of military strength, the combined naval, land, and air forces of China, Britain, and the United States can certainly hold a winning ticket against Japan, there is no doubt about this. So if someone is "afraid" of launching a large-scale war in the Pacific, then rather than saying it is Britain and the United States, it is better to say it is Japan itself. However, Britain and the United States are unwilling to see another war in the Pacific within the realm of possibility, so they certainly will not take action first; but if Japan takes action first, then the war cannot be delayed or avoided. Will war break out in the Pacific? Will it not break out? Everything hinges on Japan's future actions?

### Sino-US Stabilization Fund Agreement to be Signed Soon: Legal Tender Credit to be Further Consolidated; Currie to Fly to Chengdu Today: Inspection in Chongqing Comes to an End

Washington: Officials formally announced that the Sino-US Stabilization Fund Agreement is still under negotiation and will be concluded soon. (United Press dispatch, 18th)

Washington: The Sino-US loan and stabilization fund were handled by Song Ziwen and Hu Shi. President Roosevelt first announced a loan of US$50 million to China last year, and later approved the official advance of US$50 million for the stabilization fund. US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau immediately began meeting with key figures in the House and Senate to obtain their approval. Financial experts have been continuously researching the stabilization issue, believing that it can greatly restore the Chinese people's confidence in the legal tender and eliminate speculation in foreign exchange. Officials have also stated that new loans to China can enable China to purchase materials without using foreign exchange. Presidential advisor Dr. Currie is an economic expert and is currently in Chongqing studying China's economic and financial problems. (United Press dispatch, 18th)

Chongqing: Currie, Tibor Reese, and other members of the US economic delegation, who were scheduled to fly to Chengdu this morning, were unable to depart due to bad weather, as the plane they intended to take was grounded in Chengdu. They are expected to depart tomorrow instead. US Ambassador Johnson, Deputy Naval Attaché Major Burke, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Mo, and Deputy Minister of Propaganda Dong Xian Guang will also travel with them. They will stay in Chengdu for one or two days before returning to Chongqing. The members of the US economic delegation are scheduled to return to Washington around March 1. It is expected that the delegation will depart for Hong Kong immediately after returning to Chongqing from Chengdu. It is reported that during their stay in Chongqing, the US economic delegation studied more than 20 kinds of materials provided by various Chinese government organizations regarding economy, finance, currency, prices, food, transportation, and production. The delegation's talks with the Chinese authorities began on February 10 and ended yesterday. Chairman Lin hosted Currie, Tibor Reese, and outgoing Ambassador Johnson yesterday afternoon. The Sino-American Cultural Association is scheduled to host a banquet for the US economic delegation on February 20. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Seventh Anniversary of the New Life Movement: President Chiang's Broadcast Speech: Reviewing the Achievements of Past New Life Movement Work; Indicating the Key Points and Significance of Future Promotion

Chongqing: President Chiang of the New Life Movement Promotion Association delivered a radio speech to compatriots at home and abroad at 8 p.m. on the 18th, the seventh anniversary of the New Life Movement. The main points are as follows: Compatriots across the country, as we enter the fifth year of our sacred War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, we also encounter the seventh anniversary of the New Life Movement. The main purpose of the New Life Movement is to "know shame and teach war." The intention of the New Life Movement is to create a wartime life for our people that is able to endure hardship and pain, is not afraid of hunger and cold, is not afraid of violence, is disciplined and solemn, and is diligent and thrifty, so that our

entire nation

can strive and sacrifice in the era of survival of the fittest, and seek progress and development, so that our country can obtain permanent independence and freedom. Our War of Resistance and National Reconstruction has become stronger as we fight. In fact, although the effect of the New Life Movement in the past seven years has been significant, what should we do today and in the future to make persistent efforts and strengthen ourselves to complete the victory of revenge and reach

national reconstruction success.

This task is of paramount importance. Therefore, on this anniversary, I must conduct a review of the achievements of past New Life Movement work and earnestly explain to all my compatriots the key points and significance of promoting the New Life Movement in the future, and urge the reflection and self-awareness of the military and civilians across the country. Since I launched the New Life Movement in Nanchang in the spring of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, it has been seven years to this day. During these

seven years,

our country's politics, military affairs, economy, education, and other aspects have gradually transformed and improved. Many of these steps have been influenced by the New Life Movement, although it is invisible, it is actually very profound. Before the New Life Movement was launched in the 23rd year, the unification of our country had not been fully realized, and local autonomy had no foundation. In the military, the spirit of combat was still lacking training, and civilian organizations could not keep pace with

wartime needs. In the economy, national industries were immature, and national production was insufficient. In education, thoughts were mixed, and educators rarely understood the importance of personality guidance and enhancing national spirit. Our entire life was filled with old habits such as corruption, extravagance, cowardice, and procrastination, and there was no new atmosphere of national reconstruction that was noble, simple, courageous, and lively. Now, we dare not be complacent or complacent, nor do we deny that the elimination of evil

is not yet complete. However, all aspects of our national, social, and personal lives are different from the past. Our country has achieved true unification, and our politics, under this unified leadership, are moving towards improving efficiency. Our military and civilians have a strong and courageous fighting spirit and a disciplined and solemn fighting discipline. Whether it is the front line or the rear, men, women, old, and young,

are united, fighting bravely and unyielding under the sacred will of resisting the enemy and defending the country. Our economy has a continuous supply of new and reconstructed construction, and the combination of national enterprises and private production is even more active. Our education has been extended to the guidance of morality and personality and the enhancement of national spirit. Our society has produced many new spirits that meet the

standards of the New Life Movement. Especially, the thoughts of our people have been able to eliminate many mixed and confusing concepts and shallow and complicated psychology. All patriotic compatriots have unanimously accepted the Three People's Principles as the highest principles of national founding, becoming our common belief. (To be continued) (Dispatch, 18th)

Washington: Yesterday, when the Senate began debating the Lend-Lease Act to aid democratic countries, a fierce debate arose over whether the United States should enter the war. Democratic leader and Senator from Kentucky, Barkley, opened the meeting with a request for the speedy passage of the bill. Former Republican presidential supporter and Senator Taft strongly opposed the bill, calling Barkley's request "a powerful excuse for war." Barkley denied Taft's interpretation, saying, "I am not in favor of war. I oppose the United States entering the war and want to defeat Hitler overseas by helping England so that we do not have to fight here." Barkley continued, "Upon reaching the bridgehead, it will be necessary to cross the bridge, but at present, I do not wish to endorse the war. As to whether this time will necessarily come, I cannot know in advance." Prominent Republican Senator from Vermont, Austin, also exclaimed, "The world is facing a war that is even worse, a slavery that is worse than death. When the time for us to fight arrives, we must fight!"

After the debate ended, Barkley stated that he was confident that the bill would pass within two weeks by approximately seventy votes to twenty-five. (International News Service report from the 18th)

### Turkey and Bulgaria Sign Non-Aggression Pact; Both Countries Declare Maintenance of Friendly Relations to Prevent War from Spreading to the Balkans

London: Radio Rome claimed that Turkey and Bulgaria signed a non-aggression pact yesterday afternoon at the Turkish Foreign Ministry. The Turkish representative was Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu, and the Bulgarian representative was the Bulgarian envoy to Turkey. According to a joint statement issued by the Turkish and Bulgarian governments, the two sides concluded this treaty after a renewed exchange of views on the situation. It is divided into the following four points: (1) Turkey and Bulgaria recognize the non-use of any aggression as the immutable basis of their foreign policy; (2) Moved by the spirit of mutual friendship, the two governments are determined to maintain and develop their confidence in good-neighborly relations; (3) The two governments declare their readiness to seek appropriate means to develop trade relations between the two countries to the greatest extent suitable to the economic structures of both countries; (4) The two governments hope that the newspapers of both countries will be motivated by the mutual friendship and confidence reaffirmed in this declaration to express their opinions. (Reuters report from the 18th)

Vichy: After the joint declaration issued by the governments of Bulgaria and Turkey today, observers here believe that this is another new factor in preserving peace in the Balkan Peninsula. The issuance of this declaration, following the important military talks between the staff officers of the British and Turkish armed forces, is of particular significance. Since the outbreak of the current European war, Turkey and Bulgaria have not been able to trust each other without reservation, and have therefore repeatedly taken military measures on their respective sides of the border. Turkish President İsmet also visited the Dardanelles area to inspect defenses. Regarding Bulgaria's request for an outlet on the Aegean Sea, namely the "Alexandroupolis Port issue," Turkey has consistently supported Greece and expressed its opposition. Given the past state of relations between the two countries, the fact that they were able to issue a joint communiqué this time, reaffirming friendship, could prevent Bulgaria from taking any action against Greece using the Italian-Greek war. At the same time, it is rumored in the Bulgarian capital that important figures in the country will soon follow the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia to Berlin. In recent days, rumors about the situation in the Balkan Peninsula have been rife, causing great anxiety in all quarters. However, after hearing the aforementioned news, it should be possible to feel relieved. (Havas News Agency report from the 17th)

Turkish Foreign Minister Issues Statement: Anglo-Turkish Treaty Still Valid

Ankara: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu commented last night on the recently signed Turco-Bulgarian non-aggression pact, stating, "A very small cause may sometimes have a major effect. This very small document may prevent the war from spreading to the Balkans." Authoritative sources here said last night that the Anglo-Turkish military treaty remains valid, as this new pact states that it does not affect obligations to other countries. (International News Service report from the 18th)

Sofia: Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov issued a statement last night, stating that after an exchange of views between Turkey and Bulgaria, the Turco-Bulgarian Friendship and Non-Aggression Treaty has been signed, and Turco-Bulgarian relations will become even more consolidated. This treaty is also a testament to the desire of both countries to maintain peace and mutual respect. (Haitong News Agency report from the 18th)

New York: Regarding the signing of the non-aggression pact between Bulgaria and Turkey, political figures here admit that it is a political event that is unfavorable to Britain. Newspapers pointed out that when Turkey and Bulgaria were conducting negotiations, London was deeply uneasy and had instructed its ambassador to Turkey, Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen, to strongly advise the Turkish government, attempting to obstruct it. Therefore, Hugessen was extremely active in Ankara, the Turkish capital, in the middle of last week. (Haitong News Agency report from the 18th)

London: Responsible figures here made the following comments today on the Turco-Bulgarian agreement: To understand the true nature of the Turco-Bulgarian agreement, we should recall that these negotiations were initiated by Turkey in an attempt to unite the Balkans, which Britain greatly approved of, as Britain has repeatedly stated that the unity of the Balkans is the best way to counter the threat of Nazi aggression. After German forces infiltrated Bulgaria, the value of this agreement was greatly diminished. Under the current circumstances, we cannot be without doubt as to Bulgaria's ability to maintain its neutrality. As for Turkey, it has consistently informed Britain of the progress of the negotiations. (Reuters report from the 18th)

London: The News Chronicle published an article by Bartlett, stating that the timely conclusion of the agreement between Turkey and Bulgaria will provide the Nazis with an opportunity for propaganda. The Nazis are now fully exploiting this kind of propaganda. Therefore, it is particularly important that Turkey has clearly stated that the agreement does not affect its obligations to Britain. The Turkish army does not want to enter Bulgaria to resist the German army in that country, but will station troops in places of its own choosing to protect its national interests. This has long been clear, so the new agreement has not in fact changed the existing situation. I believe that the negotiations for the agreement were initiated by Turkey. At that time, the Turks seemed to think that it might encourage the Bulgarians to stop the entry of German troops. However, the times changed faster than the negotiations. Although the environment has changed, if the Bulgarians had refused to negotiate, it would have increased the panic among certain parties in Bulgaria that Turkey would launch a preemptive attack. In one clause of the agreement, Turkey stated its close understanding with Britain. London has expressed full satisfaction with this, which must be reiterated. (Reuters report from the 18th)

London: According to British envoy to Bulgaria Rendel, Britain's policy is aimed at maintaining Bulgaria's neutrality and independence and preventing the spread of war to Bulgaria. (Reuters report from the 18th)

Sofia: Diplomatic circles here today believe that after the signing of the Turco-Bulgarian non-aggression pact, Greece will not succumb to a peace manipulated by the Axis powers, and will soon suffer a German group invasion through Bulgaria. At the same time, it is generally believed that the Turco-Bulgarian agreement can eliminate the possibility of a German attack on the Dardanelles. People here believe that the Soviet Union has taken on the task of guaranteeing the Bulgarians under the agreement, assuming the position of protector of Turkey that Britain held in the past. British envoy to Bulgaria Rendel issued a warning today that Britain will be prepared to deal with any eventuality. "We do not want to violate Bulgaria's neutrality first, but if the war spreads to Bulgaria, the first to arrive will be Germany." (International News Service report from the 18th)

Sofia: The sudden signing of the Turco-Bulgarian non-aggression pact yesterday clearly eliminated the last obstacle for Hitler to pass through Bulgaria to Salonica, unless Greece immediately submits to Axis-controlled peace. This significant treaty was signed yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in Ankara, the Turkish capital, largely due to secret mediation by the Soviet Union. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union has obtained a promise from Germany to Turkey not to attack, and that the Soviet Union has notified Bulgaria that if King Boris of Bulgaria decides to resist German action, Bulgaria should not expect aid from Soviet Russia. Although the non-aggression pact stipulates that Turco-Bulgarian current obligations to other countries are not changed, it is generally believed that this agreement is a fatal blow to the Anglo-Turkish military alliance, as this move will deprive Britain of its last ally in the southeast. It is expected that Bulgaria and Hungary will immediately sign a similar treaty. It is understood that this treaty was discussed when the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia were recently hosted by Hitler in Germany. It is believed that the signing of the non-aggression treaty is a prelude to Germany's demand that Greece accept the Axis-controlled Greco-Italian peace.

### Greek Forces Launch Local Offensive; Capture Important Mountain Peak

Athens: Continuous reports of Greek victories on the Albanian front continue to arrive. A Greek communiqué stated that Greek forces have launched a local offensive, driving enemy troops out of several areas. The vanguard captured 250 enemy soldiers and seized some war material. In addition, an enemy aircraft was shot down. Italian troops between Moscopole and Tepelene have been routed, abandoning a considerable amount of war material and supplies. Greek forces have also attacked the Italian lines between Chrisoula and Tepelene. (Reuters report from the 18th)

Athens: An official war report was released, stating, "Yesterday, fierce fighting occurred in several locations between our forces and the enemy. Our forces captured several new Italian positions and captured approximately 10,000 enemy officers and soldiers. British aircraft also flew to the front to assist in the battle, dropping bombs and strafing enemy positions with machine guns, which was extremely effective. All British aircraft safely returned to their bases after the operation. In addition, our Northern Route Army continued to advance along several routes. Only the Pogradec area was calm and uneventful. At noon, an enemy unit launched an attack on the area near Tevole, but was repelled by our air force. In addition, after defeating the enemy's 11th Army, our Southern Route Army has taken control of the Tepelene area." (Havas News Agency report from the 18th)

Athens: The Greek radio station announced this morning that fierce fighting occurred all day yesterday along the Albanian front. It was reported that Greek forces captured a 6,000-foot mountain peak in the Tepelene area overlooking Italian positions. At the same time, a new offensive near Erbasan has also reached its intended target. Military experts point out that the Greek strategy is to concentrate attacks on certain targets rather than launch a broad offensive on the front line.

### Million Sanusi Tribe Members Help British in War

Cairo: The Free French News Agency announced that, according to Sanusi leader Idris, speaking to a reporter from the Egyptian newspaper, Al-Ahram, one million Sanusi tribesmen from Tripolitania, Egypt, Sudan, Hejaz, Palestine, Syria, and the Sahara are currently fighting on the British side. It is said that the Sanusi tribe has been fighting Italy for freedom for more than twenty years. The abuse suffered by Muslims in Italy compared to the peace enjoyed in the British Empire is like heaven and earth. Therefore, Britain's war against dictatorship is in the interest of Islam as much as it is in the interest of Christianity. (Reuters report from the 18th)

### Italy Appoints Undersecretaries for Various Ministries

### Japan Acts as if It Wishes to Be a Mediator to Resolve All International Disputes; British and Japanese Hold Talks in London

Tokyo: This morning, Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told foreign reporters that if Japan is invited and if the situation appears favorable, Japan is very willing to mediate any war. Ishii read a pre-prepared statement, expressing deep regret over various alarming reports that the situation in East Asia is becoming increasingly tense, and said that Japan sincerely desires peace, which is contrary to the state of military preparations being made by the United Kingdom and the United States to respond to unforeseen events in the Pacific and South China Sea. When asked whether the German official news agency reported that British Ambassador Sir Craigie had expressed the opinion of mediation when visiting the Foreign Ministry at the end of last week, Ishii did not acknowledge this statement, and said that Japan has received various alarming reports that give people the impression that the situation in East Asia is extremely tense. The unwarranted concern of certain countries over the tension in East Asia is truly surprising. We would like to state firmly that, in our eyes, there is no reason to panic about the situation in East Asia. We would like to firmly state that the aim of the Tripartite Pact is peace, so we cannot help but feel some anxiety about the military preparations made by the British government to respond to unforeseen events in the Pacific and South China Sea, even if we do not fear them. Reports about this kind of action by Britain and Italy, originating from the British and American sides, etc., are causing increasing anxiety, the result of which is that Japanese figures have suggested that Japan should immediately take necessary steps to respond to the worst-case scenario in those two areas without delay. If the U.S. government could be persuaded to limit its war preparations to the Western Hemisphere and not cause unnecessary anxiety in the hearts of the Japanese people, then the situation would definitely be greatly eased. Regardless of the motive, we really cannot see any benefit in prolonging the war. The current situation requires a lofty statesman-like demeanor, and we believe that there is no shortage of this kind of statesman-like demeanor in places such as the British Empire. Ishii concluded by saying, "We now wish to state that Japan is very willing to be a mediator, or to restore a normal state of affairs in any part of the world that is sufficient to restore a normal state of affairs. The leading powers bear a great responsibility for restoring world peace and civilization. This kind of responsibility can only be fulfilled by wise and magnanimous politicians who are willing to listen to the demands and advice of others." A reporter asked whether Japan would be willing to initiate mediation in the European war. Ishii replied that it would be willing to, as long as the relevant powers invite Japan to do so and the situation is suitable for this. Japan is currently only acting as a mediator in the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute, and if the relevant powers invite it, it would also be willing to act as a mediator in other parts of the world. Ishii declined to reveal the contents of the recent talks between the British ambassador and Foreign Minister Matsuoka. When asked to provide evidence to show that Britain and the United States are making military preparations in the Pacific and South China Sea, Ishii replied that this includes stationing troops in Malaya and considering building defenses on the Samoan Islands. (Reuters report from the 18th)

London: Japanese diplomatic circles today said that tension between the United Kingdom and Japan has eased noticeably after Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Shigemitsu met with British Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler yesterday. Shigemitsu and Butler talked for an hour at the British Foreign Office. Japanese diplomatic circles believe that the talks provided Butler with an opportunity to reiterate Britain's concerns about Japan's southward advance, and gave Shigemitsu an opportunity to assure Britain that Japan's current policy is not directed against Britain. It is rumored here that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Craigie strongly expressed Britain's concern about Japan's actions in the south and Japan's current policy during his meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka in Tokyo last Saturday. (United Press report from the 18th)

### Axis Powers Sleep in the Same Bed but Dream Different Dreams; Matsuoka Claims He Has Not Heard Anything About the Nazi Plan to Invade Britain

Tokyo: Foreign Minister Matsuoka said today in his speech to the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives that he guaranteed that the Japanese government had absolutely no knowledge of the German plan to invade Britain, but said that the U.S. Lend-Lease Act could not be implemented within six months after its passage to prevent Germany's possible invasion of Britain. (Reuters report from the 18th)

### Maintaining Friendly Relations Between Britain and Thailand

Bangkok - British Minister to Thailand, Sir Josiah Crosby, stated to guests yesterday that British-Thai relations are extremely harmonious. Any contrary news circulating is utterly ridiculous and not worth refuting. It is noted that a foreign radio station broadcasted claims of a British intention to invade Thailand, which drew Mr. Crosby's attention, leading him to issue the above statement. (Reuters, 18th)

Bangkok - The Thai government has launched an investigation into rumors of Thai citizens in southern provinces being greatly disturbed by British warships patrolling near Songkhla in Thai territorial waters, and British troops gathering at the Thai border.

There are no special issues between Australia and Japan that cannot be resolved through peaceful negotiations. (Reuters, 18th)

### No Plans to Withdraw US Troops from North China - Reports in Eastern Newspapers Untrue

Local News - Officials of the Fourth Marine Regiment here declared today that the US Navy currently has no plans to withdraw from North China. The US Navy authorities criticized the Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun" report claiming that the US Navy is withdrawing from North China. US Navy personnel who left North China yesterday did so because they had completed their mission there, and new troops have been dispatched for reassignment. (Associated Press, 18th)

Tokyo - The "Asahi Shimbun" today prominently published a report from Tianjin stating that US Marines have withdrawn from North China. It claimed that the first batch of withdrawing troops, 30 from Tianjin and 27 from Beiping, departed by train yesterday for Qinhuangdao, to board American ships bound for Shanghai and Manila. The "Asahi Shimbun" noted that British troops withdrew from North China last year. This withdrawal of US troops has caused great unease among British and American residents in Beiping and Tianjin. (Associated Press, 18th)

Manila - The Manila "Bulletin" reports that British women previously evacuated from Hong Kong to Baguio in the Philippines have now been ordered to evacuate to Australia. The reason is unclear, but it may be due to high living costs. (Associated Press, 18th)

### Japanese Official Discusses Dutch East Indies' Status, Linking it to Vietnam

Tokyo - Foreign Vice-Minister Ohashi stated in the Diet today that Japan is currently negotiating with the Dutch government in exile in Britain, recognizing them as the governing authority of the Dutch East Indies. The status of the Dutch government in exile is unprecedented. Therefore, Japan is currently negotiating with the Dutch East Indies authorities, who are taking orders from the Dutch government in London. Answering questions, Ohashi explained in detail the relationship between the Dutch government in London and the Dutch East Indies, and the Vichy government and Vietnam. The Dutch East Indies are part of Dutch territory, while Vietnam is a French colony. Ohashi also expressed his opinion that, normally, the Dutch government would seek refuge in the Dutch East Indies, its own territory, but currently, the unnatural situation is that the government is in London while its territory is in the East Indies. Ohashi further compared this to France. A member of the Diet asked what impact Article 2 of the Tripartite Pact, which stipulates that Germany and Italy agree to recognize and respect Japan's leadership in building a new order in East Asia, would have on this situation. Ohashi replied that Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute is an example of this leadership. This demonstrates that Japan will take responsibility to prevent disputes between various races in East Asia, to ensure their happiness and prosperity. Its meaning is not that Japan will occupy or conquer by force. He believes that Japan will revise its proposed southward advance policy, according to local needs. Ohashi declined to predict the situation in the event of British defeat, stating that he believes the Dutch government might then withdraw to the Dutch East Indies. Japan will take appropriate measures, based on the actions taken by the Dutch government in London in this established situation. Even if the above situation comes to pass, the target of Japan's negotiations, the Dutch East Indies government, will still exist. He believes that Japan's relationship with them will not be truly affected, as it is a matter separate from European issues. Therefore, he believes that as long as the Dutch East Indies government exists, no difficulties will arise, regardless of what happens to the Dutch government in London. (Reuters, 18th)

Berlin - The new Japanese Ambassador to Germany, General Oshima, arrived here yesterday afternoon. Speaking to a reporter from the "Berlin Financial Times", he stated that his mission upon returning to Germany is to further strengthen German-Japanese relations and work together to build a new world order. As for Japan's diplomatic policy towards the United States, he hopes that the United States can accurately understand Japan's goals. Considering the United States' own living space and raw material resources, it is inappropriate to interfere in the living space of other countries. (Haitong Press, 18th)

### Ending US Dollar Checking Accounts, Franc Exchange Rate Becomes Stronger, Speculators Hit By US Dollar Release, New Measures to be Implemented in March

The New Voice Press reports that four American banks in Shanghai - Citibank, Chase, National City Bank, and American Express - have jointly decided to close US dollar checking accounts and cease opening new US dollar checking accounts starting March 1. Existing US dollar checking account holders will be allowed to remit funds to New York or transfer them to savings accounts, where they can still be withdrawn directly from the bank counters upon presentation of a savings passbook, but checks cannot be used. This does not apply to Chinese yuan accounts. It is understood that these measures are preventative in nature, aimed at preventing the abuse of US dollar checking accounts. The banks solemnly declare that these measures will not affect the interests of account holders or the overall financial situation in Shanghai. They hope that account holders will not believe rumors circulating outside.

Franc Exchange Rate Soars Yesterday

Since American banks here announced that they would abolish all US dollar checking accounts starting March 1, the exchange rate of the Chinese yuan (franc) has become stronger, reaching a new high for the year. At closing, one hundred yuan rose to a high of US$5.87. According to business circles, American banks have taken the initial steps to prepare for a possible withdrawal from the Far East in the event of war in the Pacific. This move not only protects the interests of the banks but also the interests of account holders. They also pointed out that if the American banks did not make these new preparations in advance, difficulties would arise if war broke out. Now that these preparations have been made, they should be able to cope with ease. Since the announcement of the new measures, a large number of US dollars have been released into the foreign exchange market in this city, in stark contrast to the situation of the past few days. It is reported that the Japanese are also releasing US dollars in large quantities. At the same time, the Chinese government banks are not actively buying up the US dollars released into the market. In addition, stock prices have fallen due to the strong yuan, returning to the low prices of last week.

Profound Analysis by Economic Commentator

The famous economic commentator Arus published an article in the English-language "China Press" yesterday, commenting on the American banks' move to stop US dollar checking accounts in the city. Financial circles here have offered conflicting comments on the recent measures taken by American banks. This move is undoubtedly a very important action and will inevitably have some impact on the financial circles of this city. However, it is extremely thoughtless to believe that this move indicates that the general situation in Shanghai will turn for the worse in a few days.

This Move Protects the Interests of Account Holders

American banks have been considering implementing this measure for some time, and there is more than one motivation. The most important thing is that the American banks plan to provide account holders with the greatest possible protection. Tensions between Japan and the United States have been high for months. Since October of last year, people in Shanghai have been deeply fearful that war will break out soon. Once war in the Pacific truly breaks out, banks in Shanghai, including American banks, will not be able to conduct business as usual.

Switching to Savings Passbooks Has Other Advantages

Savings account holders with current deposits have a savings passbook, which is sufficient to prove the amount of money they have deposited, which is more than what they have withdrawn. However, the situation is different for checking account holders. They have no documents to prove their initial deposit amount, as they receive a transaction statement once a month. American banks also report these transactions to their home country daily by mail. Knowing this situation, one can understand the advantages of converting US dollar checking accounts to savings accounts.

Accumulation of US Dollars Too High

Another reason why American banks are implementing new measures is that they feel that their accumulation of US dollars is too high and has exceeded reasonable standards, which is not appropriate even from a business perspective. The American banks in this city believe that their accumulated US dollars should be transferred to the New York headquarters of the two banks and their branches throughout the United States. They encourage the direct opening of US dollar checking accounts in the United States to reduce their burden. Another purpose of the American banks' new measures may be to frustrate foreign exchange speculators in Shanghai and provide new assistance to the Chinese yuan. However, American banks guarantee that their cessation of US dollar checking accounts should not be regarded as a type of monetary policy, as transactions with yuan account holders will continue uninterrupted.

### Rampant Rumors in the Market, Foreign Rice Breaks Price Limit, Thoroughly Investigate Rice Stocks, Severely Punish Speculation, Do Not Hesitate Any Longer

Yesterday, the rice market saw the highest price of foreign rice exceed the limit of 85 yuan per stone due to speculators continuing to spread rumors in the market and black market dealings reappearing. The city's food situation is once again becoming serious. If this is not stopped immediately, there could be dire consequences. The details are recorded below:

Rice-Producing Areas See Shuttle Shipping

The rumors spread by speculators in the rice market yesterday were that the shipping of Hong Kong rice would soon be banned, and that the evolution of the situation in the Far East would hinder the transport of foreign rice to Shanghai. However, according to actual facts, 12,000 bags of Hong Kong rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Furthermore, shipping in Southeast Asia is being maintained as usual. The Norwegian ship Sal and the French ship Los have successively sailed to Saigon, and the ships sailing to Hong Kong today include the Guangdong, Suzhou, Taiyuan, Hubei, and Mingsheng, a total of five ships. The Guangdong will also travel to Siam, and the Langli is scheduled to sail to Rangoon tomorrow. Since shipping in rice-producing areas is smooth, there should be no problem with the source of foreign rice. The so-called ban on the export of Hong Kong foreign rice is also a baseless rumor. Furthermore, Hong Kong is only a transit port for foreign rice, and a ban would not greatly affect our port's rice market, as rice merchants in this city can directly order from foreign production areas. However, speculators, seeing that the rice stocks in this port are abundant and the source is abundant, and that rice prices will gradually fall, are deliberately creating unfounded rumors to disrupt the market and raise prices, simply to satisfy their private desires for profit.

Thoroughly Investigate Rice Stocks Without Tolerance

High food prices make it increasingly difficult for residents to make a living. However, the step-by-step increase in rice prices is due to the manipulation and monopoly of speculative rice profiteers. The amount of rice being hoarded is very substantial, and the source remains unobstructed. It is hoped that the authorities of the two settlements will conduct a secret investigation of the rice warehouse stocks as soon as possible. If it is found that there are long-term hoards that are not intended to be released on schedule, their real owners' names, the date of entry into the warehouse, and the purchase price of the rice should be recorded, and they should be urged to supply the market immediately. Otherwise, the rice will be confiscated and used for price stabilization to relieve civilians, and the amount of rice accumulated in the investigation should be made public in the newspapers so that the public can know. If the matter is handled vaguely and they are allowed to go with the flow, rice prices will inevitably rise again, and it may be difficult to maintain the price limit. At that time, what would happen to social order is unimaginable. It is said that the Shanghai Municipal Council's investigation of food rice last week showed a large increase. The food rice stocks of the bean rice firms in the Bean Rice Industry Association alone totaled 811,076 bags, an increase of 145,403 bags compared to the previous period. In addition, rice shops, warehouses, and storehouses also have large stocks, and the number of rice stocks accumulated by private individuals such as manufacturers is also large.

### Municipal Council Elections Rushing Forward, British and American Candidates to be Selected by End of Month, Five Japanese Candidates to be Introduced Next Week

The English-language "China Press" reports that the Japanese community in Shanghai began preparing yesterday for the Shanghai Municipal Council annual elections on April 2 and 3. It is widely believed that the Japanese side will nominate five candidates as in the past to participate in the election. It is expected that the Japanese candidates will be formally selected within a week after the re-election of the Executive Committee of the Japanese Residents Association on Saturday and Sunday this week. It is understood that there are already 42 candidates, only half of whom will be formally elected as members of the Executive Committee.

British and American Candidates to be Recommended

Although the American community has already nominated two candidates, the American Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to the community yesterday, stating that candidates can still be nominated, but the deadline is strictly set at the 27th of this month, and no more will be added. Therefore, a second round of voting will not be held, and Mr. Allman and Mr. Mills will formally be the candidates for the next Municipal Council election. The British Association is responsible for recommending British candidate directors and will recommend candidates in the near future and will decide on countermeasures, as the competition between Britain and Japan is extremely fierce. As for the number of candidates, it will be the same as in the past, a total of five.

### British and American Organizations in Shanghai Assist in Evacuation Matters, Citizens of Both Countries are Willing to Follow Advice, Timely Evacuation to Meet Government Expectations

The British authorities reiterated the evacuation advice on the evening of the 16th. This advice is most applicable to British women and children in the occupied areas. Even for citizens in non-occupied areas, the authorities strongly support and will provide considerable convenience if they feel there is no need to stay in China and intend to evacuate. In recent days, British community organizations such as the British Association of Shanghai, the British Women's Association, the Veterans Association, and the Royal Air Force Association have all been concerned about this matter and are striving to cooperate with the authorities to promote the evacuation of citizens for the safety of individuals and the country. Although this is only advice in nature and has absolutely no mandatory meaning, citizens are generally able to consider the overall situation and the government's painstaking efforts to take precautionary measures and prevent problems before they occur, and are also willing to evacuate in a timely manner. Yesterday, a British woman told a reporter, "As a British person, I should follow any form of well-intentioned advice from the government."

British Citizens in Tianjin and Beiping Gather in Shanghai

British citizens are concentrated in Tianjin and Beiping, totaling five to six hundred people. After receiving the consulate's evacuation advice, they, realizing that the situation may indeed change, intend to pack their bags and concentrate in Shanghai in the short term to wait for ships to go to the future. According to transportation circles, there are two routes for the evacuation of British citizens: first, to take ships of the American President Lines to the United States and then transfer to Canada; second, to take British merchant ships such as Jardine Matheson, Butterfield & Swire to British territories such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Rangoon, and then transfer to Australia or the British mainland. However, it is feared that not many will return to their home country, and Australia and Rangoon are the most ideal places to settle down.

The Coolidge Carries Citizens in Evacuation

It is learned that the largest ship of the company, the President Coolidge, is the most recent to sail from Shanghai to the United States. It is expected to return to Shanghai from Manila on the 25th of this month, and will cross the Pacific Ocean and sail to the United States the next day. The ship can originally carry 900 passengers. Recently, due to the large number of citizens evacuated from Manila and Shanghai, small beds have been temporarily added, bringing the total number of berths to over 1,200. The ship's berths are almost sold out, and some of the American citizens in Japan will also board the ship in Yokohama and Kobe to return to their home country.

Evacuation Committee Handles Relief

The evacuation committee formed by the US Consulate General, the American Chamber of Commerce, and the American Association has resumed its work due to the authorities reiterating the evacuation order. The main responsibilities of the committee are investigation, registration, and subsidy. It is learned that 16 people have requested subsidies for travel expenses from the committee. In order to seriously handle the matter and prevent fraud and fraudulent claims, the committee is conducting a strict investigation. Once the investigation is conclusive, a corresponding subsidy will be provided, and they will be designated to board the American President Lines mail ships that regularly depart for their home country. It is estimated that the total number of American citizens in this port who should be evacuated is around 1,500, and one-third of them can return to their home country within an appropriate period.

### "Ziba De" Ship Sails Out Today, Dutch Ship Resumes Voyage

The Dutch ship operating on the Far East route was ordered to suspend its voyage by the Dutch government last Thursday, causing the "Ziz Sujia" mail ship of the Java Company, which had arrived in the Philippines, to be ordered to anchor in Little Luzon and stop its northward journey. After arriving in Shanghai on the evening of the 14th, the "Ziba De" ship originally planned to return south that night, but received a telegram from the head office, allowing it to unload arriving goods in Shanghai and load exports. Now it is known that the suspension order has been lifted, so the "Ziz Lianjia" ship, which was anchored in the Philippines, has also set sail north and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong today and in Shanghai within this week. The "Ziba De" ship in Shanghai will load all export goods today and return to Java along its original route. The Royal Company's "Tegel Berg" ship, which was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, failed to arrive on time due to the above-mentioned impact. It has now resumed its voyage and should arrive in port within a few days. The American President Lines' "President Coolidge" mail ship passed through Shanghai on the 12th of this month to go to Southeast Asia and will return north from the Philippines today, arriving in Shanghai on the 25th and departing for Japan and the United States on the 26th, one day later than the scheduled sailing date.

It is also reported that one hundred and fifty U.S. military personnel who have completed their travels in China from Beijing and Tianjin will also be transported back to the United States.

### Chinese Directors Give Farewell Dinner for Colonel Xiang Pei

Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Guo Shun, Xi Yuhua, Chen Tingrui and other Chinese directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the fact that the Commander's term of office coincided with a turbulent period in the city and that he had made significant contributions to local security and planning and commanding, held a farewell dinner at the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Club at noon yesterday (the 18th) on behalf of the Chinese merchants and residents to express their gratitude.

### Rescuing People from Hardship is a Great Act of Righteousness – May All Readers of This Newspaper Rise Up Together

Since the outbreak of the war, people from various places have come to Shanghai to seek refuge. Initially, it was thought that the situation could be quickly resolved and they could return to their hometowns to resume their businesses. However, year after year, their travel funds have dwindled and they have nowhere to turn. This kind of predicament is unimaginable to those who have not experienced it firsthand. This newspaper has received a large number of letters from refugees stranded in Shanghai. In addition to providing possible assistance whenever possible, there is no way to arrange for each of them one by one. Drawing on others' strengths to make up for one's own weaknesses is an endless lament. Thinking that there must be many enthusiastic people among the readers of this newspaper, if they can provide active assistance to people in need, then not only will those who benefit be grateful beyond measure, but it will also be a great act of righteousness that benefits society and the country. Now, Mr. Zhong Daohua has submitted a letter to this newspaper.

### Actively Helping People

Gaining the sympathetic help of all sectors of society. The words are sincere and touching, and the reasoning is clear. Readers, if you have the spare capacity to help others, please communicate directly with Mr. Zhong, or send it through this newspaper. However, this newspaper advocates actively helping people. If there is a suitable position, it is best to employ them. Giving money is only saving people temporarily.

### Zhong Daohua's Letter

Editor:

I, Zhong Daohua, am from Zhenhai, Ningbo. Since the Zhenhai Incident last year, after taking refuge in Shanghai, I originally hoped for an early resolution of the situation so that I could solve my family's livelihood. However, since arriving in Shanghai, I have been carrying more than I can bear. Unexpectedly, nothing has worked out, and my family's livelihood is extremely worrying. For this reason, I have no choice but to write to you, sir, and beg you to consider me with a kind heart, and use a corner of your newspaper to publish this and appeal on my behalf. There is no shortage of warm-hearted people in the world, with compassionate and kind hearts, who may be able to introduce me to a job or provide financial assistance. If I can get any of these, I will be grateful to you, sir, without end. I sincerely ask, and wish you good health.

Zhong Daohua, February 17.

"Attached Resume": Zhong Daohua, from Ningbo, 37 years old, graduated from Zhenhai County Middle School, and has served as a lawyer's clerk for five years, an elementary school principal for five years, and a secretary for three years.

### Check on Gambling Dens in the Chinese Quarter, Lu Ding Shot and Killed, One Assailant Shot and Captured, Stray Bullets Injure Two Passersby, Lu Was Previously Attacked Three Months Ago

At nine o'clock yesterday morning, a shooting assassination case suddenly occurred on Rue des Soeurs, French Concession. The victim, Lu Ding, was shot twice and died soon after. One of the shooters was shot and captured while trying to escape. Stray bullets injured one man and one woman. The details of the case are as follows: Lu Ding, a native of Changshu, 26 years old, resides at No. 6 Defeng Lane, Rue du Cercle, French Concession. He previously opened Wanli Rice Store on Fangxie Road in the Chinese Quarter and was a shareholder in the former Huili gambling den in the Four Roads area. Now he is in charge of checking gambling dens at Huale Hotel at 792 Yu Garden Road.

### Gambling Den Inspector

At 9:05 yesterday morning, Lu left his home due to the rain, wearing a gray raincoat. Unexpectedly, when he passed the intersection of Rue des Soeurs and Avenue du Lieutenant Petiot, a man wearing a coarse woolen robe suddenly pulled out a gun and fired two shots at Lu, both hitting his waist. He fell wounded in a pool of blood at the entrance of No. 4, Laoda Fang Teashop, No. 27 Rue des Soeurs. Seeing that he had achieved his goal, the shooter ran towards the Xiaocaichang area on Avenue du Lieutenant Petiot. The constable on duty at post number 847 nearby, having heard the alarm, rushed to the scene. At the same time, a patrol team from the French police station was searching pedestrians. The shooter took the initiative to fire and resist arrest. The police also attacked from the front and back, firing shots. For a time, gunshots rang out, and pedestrians fled in panic. The two sides fired a total of

### More Than Forty Shots

As a result, the shooter was shot twice in the leg and fell to the ground, surrendering. A pistol was seized from him, and the bullets in the chamber had been used up. By this time, the French police station had dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene, and urgently summoned a car to take Lu Ding and the shooter to the hospital. Lu died soon after due to his serious injuries. According to the shooter's confession, his name is Feng Shude, a native of Ningbo, 26 years old. When the shooter opened fire to resist arrest, the bullets were like a string of pearls, injuring an old man, Zhang Heming (a local, 61 years old), in the left leg, and a woman, Chen Li (from Jiangbei, 32 years old), in the right leg. They were also taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment by car afterwards. The police station is investigating the case. As for Lu's assassination, this is the second time. The first was on the evening of November 21 last year, when Lu held a wedding at the Dasanxing Restaurant on Fuzhou Road.

### Held Wedding Ceremony

He was shot from the side of the stairs, and the bullet missed. Because the shooter was being pursued, he fired shots along the way, fatally wounding Chen Jinsheng (25 years old), a carter from Chongming, who drove a Phoenix Guide Agency chartered car at the roadside. Unexpectedly, after three months, he was shot again and finally died. The French police station has ordered a strict investigation into the cause of the bloody case. Lu's body has been transferred to the Taillacherie Road morgue for autopsy.

### Japanese Secret Agent Disguised as Chinese Arrested on Avenue Foch, Concealed a Pistol Found by Detectives, Released After Being Identified as Japanese

According to the Continental Press, yesterday (the 17th) at around 9:30 a.m., an officer from the Japanese military intelligence team, disguised as Chinese, wearing a long gown and carrying a pistol, was riding on a Route 2 bus when he was arrested on Avenue Foch, Rue Paul Beau when police detectives were inspecting passengers. They found a pistol near him and took him to the Chengdu Road Police Station. The Japanese immediately declared that he was not Chinese, but a Japanese military intelligence agent. After the police station confirmed this with the Japanese Military Police Headquarters on North Sichuan Road, the Japanese was released. It was reported that when the police officers boarded the Route 2 bus to inspect, they finally inspected the Japanese.

### Large and Small Gambling Dens in the Chinese Quarter Suddenly All Closed Yesterday, Strict Prohibition of Opium and Gambling When Special Police Force Established in Western District

It is estimated that there are currently forty to fifty gambling dens in the Chinese Quarter, with the sound of gambling everywhere, which is deeply regrettable. However, good times do not last. Starting from dawn yesterday, some party suddenly ordered all large and small gambling dens in the Chinese Quarter to be closed and took back their licenses. Therefore, from yesterday, the gambling dens have been heavily locked, with no sign of anyone. However, according to another source, although the gambling dens in the Chinese Quarter have been ordered to close, they will be revived in a few days.

### Gambling Places in the Chinese Quarter All Closed

Gambling dens in the Chinese Quarter were all closed yesterday. It is said that the reason is that Lu Ying issued a notice in January ordering all gambling dens to change their licenses, but they have not complied to this day. Therefore, Lu Ying ordered them to stop operating today. It is also said that the Sixth Country Hotel will also be closed today. Whether this is reliable remains to be confirmed. As for the previous rumor that the Sixth Country Hotel would move to Xiaoshijie, it is said that the Xiaoshijie building has not yet been renovated, so the Sixth Country Hotel's move is probably still early.

### Opium and Gambling in the Western District Also Rumored to Close

The Pingming Agency reported that the "special police force" in the Western District's extra-settlement road area will soon be established, and all opium dens and gambling dens are facing their last days. Recently, several have closed or moved to the Nanshi Chinese Quarter every day.

According to well-informed sources, some of the larger gambling dens may temporarily suspend business for a few days, waiting to obtain "understanding" and then plan to revive and return to life.

The afternoon opening reached 5,940 yuan, but Tong Kang Yong, Yi Yuan, and Xin Da Yong jointly sold, causing a sharp drop to 5,775 yuan. At 3:15 PM, a foreign wire reported that the Japanese side, in talks with British and American reporters, aimed to avoid joining the war in the Pacific, which boosted the market. He Sheng, Xin Feng, Yong Ren, and Cheng Yong bought, gradually pushing the price back up to 5,990 yuan. The closing price was 5,950 yuan, a slight decrease of 110 yuan compared to the previous day's closing. After the close, the off-exchange market was already trading at 6,000 yuan. The spot market still saw prices about 300 yuan higher than futures, with limited trading volume. The total volume of futures trading was over 40,000 taels. For swaps, the premium for buying March instead of February narrowed to a maximum of 30 yuan, eventually settling around 10 yuan. Silver shop jewelry gold briefly dropped to 640 yuan per tael, eventually closing flat. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.

Cash Settlement Falls by 110 Yuan

From the beginning of the morning, the off-exchange decline that started after the previous day's close had already intensified. Public confidence was unsteady, and the short side's momentum was overwhelming. All parties opened by suppressing the price to 5,980 yuan, 80 yuan lower than the previous day's low. After the opening, the Shanghai West group, including Xin Yuan, bought in, causing a rebound past the 6,000 yuan mark, rising to 6,070 yuan. Upon hearing reports that foreign exchange rates were expected to remain firm, selling suddenly increased sharply, pushing the price back down into the 6,000 yuan range and breaking below 5,900 yuan. It was estimated that Tian Yi Yuan, Shi He, and securities firms followed suit, selling, driving the price to a low of 5,865 yuan. Subsequently, relying on the persistent buying by Da Feng, Cheng Ji, Heng Ji, and others, the price gradually rose to 5,935 yuan. After this, the market fluctuated within a very narrow range. The noon close was reported at 5,905 yuan. The afternoon opening was relatively stable at 5,910 yuan, and bill traders slightly absorbed supply up to 5,940 yuan. However, Tong Kang Yong and Yi Yuan remained determined to sell, breaking into the 5,900 yuan level after a long period of hovering, and eventually pushing down into the 5,800 yuan level, with a low of 5,775 yuan. The stay within the 5,800 yuan range was brief, and the price rebounded above 5,800 yuan, due to aggressive buying by He Pan, Xin Feng, Yong Ren, Cheng Yong, and others, slowly rising. Before the close, it had risen to 5,950 yuan, but the closing price dropped to 5,950 yuan, a decrease of 110 yuan compared to the previous day's settlement. The off-exchange market was quite high after the close, with reports of trades at 6,000 yuan. The daily range was 295 yuan. The spot price of the cash house's main brand gold was more than 10 yuan higher than the cash settlement price (spot), and 20 yuan lower for purchases. The current benchmark gold price remains unavailable and without a market.

Jewelry Gold Prices Fluctuate

The selling price of silver shop jewelry gold fluctuated. The asking price was lowered by 10 yuan in the morning, rebounded by 10 yuan at 2:45 PM, decreased by 10 yuan again at 3:00 PM, and recovered by 10 yuan after 4:00 PM. As a result, Da Tong Hang still quoted 650 yuan, and the new businesses quoted similar prices to the above, but purchases were reduced by 40 yuan.

### Headline: Grain Market, Rice Market Thrives Extravagantly, Spot Prices Rise Before Futures, People's Food is All Wasted

Imported rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taiyuan ship of the Da Gu Company arrived yesterday morning from Hong Kong with 6,000 bags. The Jiangsu ship also arrived yesterday afternoon from the port, carrying 2,936 bags. The Yisheng ship of the Jardine Matheson & Co. arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, also from Hong Kong, carrying 3,244 bags. A total of 12,180 bags of imported rice arrived yesterday. (Ancestor)

Yesterday, the rising trend of imported rice intensified, due to speculators hoarding and actually selling all their supplies under the influence of a speculative atmosphere. Regardless of ample supply and crowded arrivals, pricing was uniform, only knowing how to aggressively buy, with profits immediately realized after purchase, and ignoring future reversals. Generally, manipulators took advantage of this opportunity to promote aggressively, with the encouraging force increasing as the smell of gunpowder intensified. The more intense the buying, the higher the selling price. Spot rice was pushed up first, followed by futures, each responding to the other, driving prices higher and higher. Both spot and futures rice were driven up by more than a yuan. After the limit price was reached, high-priced goods were often not displayed, leading to rumors of off-exchange trades at a premium of one or two yuan. Although confirmation was sought, public sentiment was further disturbed. There were six or seven new futures transactions involving ships under negotiation, as the current exchange-rate-based pricing was already low, and large volumes could be transacted as soon as ships became available. Call futures were lively, with over 2,000 tons sold, prices rising from 5 or 6 jiao to one yuan. Saigon Road cargo No. 1 and February futures were both at 97 yuan, spot cargo No. 2 at 94 yuan, broken rice for the end of the month at 75 yuan and 1 jiao, February at 76 yuan, March at 76 yuan and 5 jiao, small mixed rice spot at 90 yuan and 91 yuan, cargo loaded on the 15th of January and cargo en route loaded in January both at 90 yuan, and February from 87 yuan and 89 yuan and 3 jiao to 5 jiao. Spot prices were softer at closing, but the high and low prices were confusing, effectively raising prices. The closing price for No. 1 new Saigon was 85 yuan to 84 yuan, No. 2 at 80 yuan, 79 yuan, Siam No. 1 at 85 yuan, closing at 82 yuan and a half, Huowen at 84 yuan, then at 82 yuan and 5 jiao, Xiaowen Pudong warehouse at 76 yuan, 75 yuan and 8 jiao, Guangdong rice at 86 yuan, Milu at 73 yuan, broken tip at 67 yuan, closing at broken rice No. 3 at 82 yuan and 8 jiao.

Thick and Thin Geng and other domestic rice varieties were still sold out upon arrival. Some remaining stocks were treated as rare commodities, so sellers became outrageous when asked, quoting prices as high as three or four yuan. However, buyers, lacking goods to use, tried to depress prices, but found it difficult to resist. As a result, opening prices were more than two yuan higher than the previous market. Kunshan Yuanbai Geng sold for 110 yuan to 108 yuan, sold by the bucket for 106 yuan to 102.1 yuan, and Qingjiao Baodao sold by the bucket for 101 and a half yuan to 100 yuan.

The actual sale of glutinous rice continues without any alleviation. However, major players continued to absorb cheap grain, causing sellers to also raise prices significantly, increasing prices by one and a half yuan. Hong Kong special white rice opened at 83 and a half yuan, ordinary at 82 yuan, glutinous rice at 75 yuan and 7 jiao, 75 yuan and 2 jiao.

### Headline: Flour Supply Suddenly Stops, Large Quantities of Imported Flour Expected at the End of the Month, Wheat Stocks in the Concessions Reach 40 Yuan

The flour market is quite tight, mainly because the Chinese factories' low-priced flour has suddenly suspended supply due to a shortage of raw materials, causing immediate public anxiety. New arrivals of imported flour are only over 30,000 bags, reportedly Canadian flour of the Golden Dragon brand, unsuitable for local customers, and priced at 24 yuan. Large quantities of new supplies are expected at the end of the month. In the current tense atmosphere between Japan and the United States, holders are seizing the opportunity to speculate and raise prices, and local customers are becoming more active in hoarding. The overall market is selling Clock Tower brand Australian flour for over 3,000 bags, with prices already rising to 24 yuan and 9 jiao. Prices for cargo en route have reached over 25 yuan, and cargo with delivery at the end of the month is priced at 24 yuan and 7 jiao, an increase of 4 or 5 jiao compared to the previous day. Currently, Australian and American flours are arriving one after another, and there is no concern of a flour shortage in the local market. However, there is concern that the supply may be interrupted at any time, and the future market is affected by international tensions.

The wheat market is also quietly rising, mainly because the domestic supply has almost been cut off, and stocks in the Shanghai market have long been depleted. Recently, the price of wheat in Wuxi has risen by a considerable 10 yuan per bag. Local wheat in Shanghai is difficult to purchase. The supply of imported wheat is also limited due to a lack of ship space, making it impossible to replenish. As a result, public confidence is growing, and wheat stored in concessions was even quoted at 40 yuan yesterday. Dozens of bags were traded on this street. The purchase price of Japanese factories is still limited to the original price, but there is no more stock available.

### Headline: Oil Cakes Cover Shorts Turn Long, All At Once

Actual sales of oil cakes remain sluggish, with the overall situation completely dominated by speculation. Therefore, the market is constantly changing. Yesterday, although the closing price the previous day was suppressed to flat, the market believed that the bulls were in control, leading to a reversal from covering shorts to turning long, with frequent buying. The highest price of soybean oil rose by three or four yuan, and soybean cake rose by three or four jiao. However, the closing price saw a slight retracement.

### Headline: Cotton Yarn, Cotton Yarn Bulls and Bears Have Different Views, Double Horse Fluctuates by Fifty or Sixty Yuan

The yarn market fluctuates greatly, and the trend is sudden and uncertain. This is because public sentiment is confused. However, actual sales are gradually becoming more active. The Hong Kong group has a growing need for 10-count yarn. It is reported that there is a small dock at the arched bridge that can be used for transportation, so those in the industry have good intentions. However, speculators continue to sell and take a negative view, showing that both sides have different opinions. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,233 yuan, the low price was 1,175 yuan, the price at the start of the afternoon trading session was 1,206 yuan, later falling to 1,181 yuan, and the final price was 1,215 yuan. Some want to buy, and 215 bales of cotton yarn are being shipped to Hong Kong today.

The morning opening for Double Horse saw the market selling in unison due to the poor sentiment in the afternoon of the previous day. The opening price was 1,209 yuan, and the price fell by two hundred yuan in an instant to 1,175 yuan. Then, the shorts took profits and covered their positions, and the price rose again. At the same time, the Hong Kong group had an actual need for around 2,000 bales, and public sentiment was rebuilt, driving the price up to 1,233 yuan. After 11:00 AM, news of falling prices caused sellers to become active again, and the price fell again to 1,181 yuan. The closing price was slightly better at 1,192 yuan. The total number of bales traded during the half-day session was 9,355. The amount bought by each group is listed on the right: Hong Kong: 1,855, Other businesses: 7,500, Total: 9,355.

### Headline: The Cotton Market Remains Stagnant

The spot cotton situation is as sluggish as ever. Because foreign exchange is being loosened and gold prices are fluctuating, public sentiment is confused, so business has entered a state of stagnation.

The New York cotton market first fell due to selling by foreign merchants, and then rose again due to buying by the same industry and spot merchants. As a result, the closing price was up one or two pound notes compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market continued to fall sharply due to heavy selling pressure and selling by all parties. Yesterday, daily forecasts predicted another small three rupees.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trade has declined as spot yarn prices continue to worsen, and international events are increasingly confusing. Therefore, foreign cotton trading has also declined and no one cares about it.

### Headline: Securities, Bond Market Uncertain

Yesterday, the gray market for public bonds saw short covering on one side and continued selling on the other. The bulls believed that the rights and interest combined were very high, while the shorts believed that in the current turbulent situation, the more time that passed, the more problems would arise. Each side had its own reasonable justification, so opinions differed and bulls and bears were evenly matched, with drastic changes possible in the future. Foreign banks are gradually seeing more withdrawals of deposits, and the situation in Shanghai is becoming more troubled. Prices rose several times, but high prices failed to hold. The market opened several jiao higher yesterday morning, and Class C even broke out of four yuan. Xin Fu, Yi Tai, Ren Chang bought in, while Po Chang Lian, Hong Da sold heavily. The noon close was up several jiao. In the afternoon, Class C was as high as nearly five yuan, more than five yuan higher than the lowest price, so sellers rushed in again. Lian Yi and Hong Da continued to sell, and bulls such as Xin Chang and Yi Chang also cut their positions. Xin Fu sold on one side and bought on the other. Lian He, Xin Hua, Hu He Ji, Zhong Fu, and others were still driving the price up, slightly better than the morning. The result was another increase of eight jiao to one yuan and six jiao, with a total turnover of two million yuan. A simple table is shown below:

Stock trading: Fifty shares of Bank of China were traded at a price of 91.5 yuan.

The situation in the public utility stock market remains uncertain. In the afternoon, the selling pressure increased as the foreign exchange market eased, and many stocks reached new lows. Jardine Matheson fell the most sharply, with a high of 86.5 yuan and a closing price down to 78.5 yuan. The volume of trading in each stock was extremely large, and rubber stocks were also suppressed.

### Headline: Piece Goods, Cloth Also Changes Greatly

The factory cloth market fell sharply yesterday with minor rebounds. The market was unsettled. The morning opening saw sharp drops in cotton yarn, and cloth selling also changed greatly. Fine Fugui cloth fell from 38 yuan 7 jiao and a half on the previous day to 36 yuan. Fine Fugui twill fell from 32 yuan and 5 jiao to 30 yuan and 5 jiao. The afternoon market rebounded five jiao to one yuan. As a result, the price of fine cloth and twill was still down one to two yuan per bolt, and the price of coarse cloth was down five jiao per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloth fell by about one yuan per bolt. More than 200 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. The Zhejiang Road, Wenzhou, and Ningbo merchants traded more than 100 pieces of fine cloth and colored cloth, the Fujian and Guangdong merchants traded 100+ pieces of bleached and dyed cloths, and twill cloths, and the Northern Road, Yanjing merchants traded 50-60 pieces of coarse and colored cloth. On the 19th, 585 packages of piece goods were transported to Hong Kong.

Essays

### Environment

— Jue Hui

Environment—everyone's "amulet," to manage things by environment; to handle things by environment; to conduct things by environment... It's not just about "protecting oneself by being wise," but also getting a "grand and upright" reputation. If one can have both fish and bear paws, who would be so foolish as to "stand firm"?

Originally, Shanghai was the place where everything "became popular" the fastest: red socks turned into bare feet, long cheongsams turned into short cheongsams, and "nail polish" moved from fingers to toes... Now that the "environment has deteriorated," it is no wonder that there is a chorus of talk about "environment."

Drinking champagne and playing with women are all for the sake of the "environment"; running to gambling dens and going to dance halls are for the sake of the "environment"; hoarding, manipulating, and profiteering are also for the sake of the "environment"...

These are all "small things" and "not worth mentioning"; what we cannot but say is something else.

What is that "something else"?... (Due to the "environment," excuse me for not speaking plainly!)

However, one may as well say something that probably does not involve the "environment": "Don't use the environment as a band-aid or a rope!"

### Records of Examinations Available at Any Time

— Chun Xiao

My younger cousin just arrived in Shanghai from the countryside, wanting to apply for school because he couldn't focus on studying in the village. He doesn't have any other relatives or friends in Shanghai, and even if he did, they wouldn't know how to apply for school, so I'm temporarily acting as his representative with full authority.

But he arrived a bit late. Almost all the schools have already held their entrance exams, and some have even started classes. Looking through the newspapers, there are still a few schools advertising for enrollment, even saying examinations were available at any time. This seems like a special consideration for students coming from afar. Isn't this my cousin's lucky break?

I rushed to a school with him, asked the doorman for a prospectus, and saw that the subjects to be tested were quite easy. The tuition wasn't particularly cheap, but because it was relatively close to home, we registered. I casually asked, "Can certificates exempt him from the exam?"

"That won't work. Here, everyone, whether they have certificates or not, must pass the entrance exam to avoid uneven levels in the future," said a gentleman whose position I couldn't quite discern. I thought, "Fortunately, the education in any school here is better than in the countryside. My cousin should be able to handle it."

The next morning, I accompanied my cousin to the exam. We first went to the academic affairs office, presented the admission ticket, and received the test paper. A tea boy led us to the examination hall, where many people were already ahead of us. At first, I thought they were all students taking the exam, but to my surprise, they were all "proctors." Counting the number of actual students, there were only six of us, including my cousin. Nobody knew who the proctor was.

They were quite clever. One person taking the exam was accompanied by four or five proctors. For example, during the English exam, someone good at English would help; during the arithmetic exam, someone good at arithmetic would help. They were truly a pool of talent. Passing was naturally within expectations. You could say it was the result of their total mobilization.

One of the older ones even complained that being in the same place with so many eyes and ears was a bit inconvenient. Unable to "pass" answers smoothly, he actually slipped the paper into his sleeve and went outside. In reality, there was no need to go to such lengths. We were all in the same "boat." Everyone understood tacitly.

Those without proctors were extremely unlucky. When they couldn't figure out the answers, they could only bite their penholders, erase with their erasers, and stare blankly, hoping someone would pass them an answer, but nobody paid them any attention. Luckily, my cousin had a flash of inspiration and pulled someone else's paper in front of him, starting to act like "Teng Wengong."

Originally, a middle school entrance exam should take a whole day, with lunch provided. Now, with examinations available at any time, the exam was over as soon as it was finished. The two-dollar registration fee, was it cheap, or was it expensive?

Since it was still early when the exam ended, we took a stroll around the school. We ran into my cousin's classmate who came to pay the fees. He said someone inside introduced him, so he didn't have to take the entrance exam.

As we slowly walked out of the school gate, we happened to run into my old classmate. After exchanging greetings, I learned that he worked at the school, so I asked him to help my cousin. He patted me on the shoulder and laughed, "You're too honest. Everything in Shanghai is like this. What does the entrance exam matter? It's just for show, to fool the simple-minded. In front of strangers, who would reveal their secrets? Everyone is on the inside, and we all understand. If you don't believe me, check the list tomorrow, and you'll see. See you tomorrow, see you tomorrow." After saying that, he went into the school gate.

The next morning, I rushed over to take a look. Sure enough, there were names on the list, everyone was accepted. So that's what "examinations available at any time" meant. It's a pity that my cousin can only put up with it there for one semester!

Secondly, her father thought of a classmate's kindness, wanting to introduce her to his older brother, promising to provide financial support for her education and cover the family's living expenses as conditions. At that time, she felt it was a significant insult, or at the very least, a ridiculous joke. But now, looking at the family's situation and the suffering of her father and mother, she couldn't help but feel a little regretful. Women were meant to marry anyway. If she could benefit her whole family through her marriage, then even if it came with some passive nature, there was no reason to curse it.

"If your brother's illness isn't treated quickly, there will be no hope!" Her mother's words kept ringing in her ears.

Her brother was her father's only son and the best companion she had from childhood to now. The day he went to Hangzhou to recuperate, Xiangqi cried for three or four hours straight and didn't even eat dinner. If this only sibling of hers were to leave and never return, there would be an eternal, unfillable scar in her heart!

"If only Principal Hou could find a position for me, then I could get an advance on half a year's salary and send it to my brother for medical expenses... I wonder how the talks with Dad went today...?" Xiangqi thought to herself incessantly.

Her father finally returned, covered in sweat, looking very excited. But within that excitement, there was also a very peculiar expression.

"Dad, did the principal find a job for me?" Before Mr. Luo even entered the house, she couldn't wait to ask. But strangely, she asked three times, and her father still didn't answer. Finally, he said vaguely,

"I'll tell you later!"

Then, Mr. Luo used some excuse to send Xiangqi back to her room and then had a secret conversation with his wife, as if discussing important military matters. (34)

### Inside the Small Vegetable Market

— Mang Bei

It's drizzling, and the weather has turned cold again.

As someone who's always busy with something, I stepped onto the muddy stone road early in the morning to go to the "wild chicken small vegetable market" behind the back door, aiming to snag some "cheap deals."

The clamor of the small vegetable market won't quiet down just because of the gloomy weather; on the contrary, the noise on a rainy day is especially disturbing.

"Thief! Catch the thief!" Suddenly, a sharp and urgent cry from a woman broke through the noise not far away!

As a result, people all cast horrified glances in that direction, with at least a hint of schadenfreude in their eyes.

Following the sound, a thirteen- or fourteen-year-old "little rascal" was running over here, still constantly chewing on a fried dough stick in his mouth…

"So that's what happened!"

As if seeing just another very ordinary thing, everyone's face was piled with a peaceful smile, and some even cast a glance of sympathy at the "little rascal"!

"In these times, things are so expensive, if you don't eat, aren't you just waiting to die? When you're starving, you naturally have to steal!" A middle-aged man who seemed "worldly wise" mumbled this way.

The market sounds clamored again…

Splashing in the muddy water, I wandered… and stopped by a beef stall.

One dollar and thirty cents a pound. An elderly lady was counting the change she received; a large chunk of bright red beef lay in her vegetable basket. The vegetable basket was hanging on her arm…

Suddenly, I was attracted by the furtive expression of someone standing behind her (also a "rascal"). Sure enough, as expected, like a cat catching a mouse, in a few seconds, that piece of beef was in his hand, and he ran off!

I didn't shout; because it was "someone else's business." Moreover, what does it matter if someone who can afford beef steals it?

But in order to "avoid suspicion," I also made a quick exit.

Further down, it was all vegetables and the like… Another dispute arose.

"Green vegetables! One and a half yuan per jin? I've never eaten them so expensive!"

Really, I've never even heard of it.

"Do you know how much rice sells for per dan now?"

Also true, the price of rice exceeded one hundred yuan!

"Humph! If rice is expensive, vegetables should be even cheaper."

I don't know what the reasoning is; but thinking about it, it's quite right.

"If vegetables are cheap, are we not supposed to eat rice?"

All true! But I didn't interrupt; because this was "someone else's business" again.

Wandering… The raindrops got bigger. The result was that I didn't manage to snag any "cheap deals"!

Those buying vegetables hurriedly set off on their way home: some had fish and meat in their baskets, and they were also carrying a chicken; but some had only a lonely bunch of "snow cabbage" lying in their baskets!

The small vegetable market – a microcosm of the city!

New Film Introduction

### "That Uncertain Feeling"

— Deng Shiying

Last year, Hollywood frantically produced a large number of so-called "screwball comedies." Among the ones we have seen and can still remember, there are "The Awful Truth" and "My Favorite Wife," etc. "That Uncertain Feeling," which is now being shown at the Dahua Theater, also belongs to this category.

The production time of "That Uncertain Feeling" was roughly also during this "frenzy," but its achievements are far inferior to "The Awful Truth." These so-called "screwball comedies" don't even talk about "consciousness," and maybe we went to see them without that intention in the first place, just to kill two hours. — So, how is "That Uncertain Feeling?"

Looking at the "cast list," this is Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas' "first collaboration." Myrna Loy is William Powell's "old partner," and for acting in comedies, if we don't say she's "good at it," we can at least say she's "experienced." Douglas, on the other hand, seems to be quite popular among Chinese audiences recently. The "The Awful Truth" mentioned above has his participation.

However, their "first collaboration," "That Uncertain Feeling," is not satisfactory. The responsibility should not be borne by them, and most of the reason lies in the script and the director.

I'm not saying that the plot of this "screwball comedy" is too "serious" and "arbitrary," because this is the "consistent style" of American comedies. Without this, there is no way to "be happy." If you want to be satisfied from this, it is your own hopes that are too high, and it also goes against your original intention of "killing time." What you may not be satisfied with is that the "happiness" in this "screwball comedy" is mostly in the dialogue and not "visualized" enough, so you feel it's not exciting enough. Of course, if you have a better understanding of the dialogue, then you will like it comparatively more.

The director's failure to develop the play and make it "happy" may be due to the limitations of the script, but the lack of brisk melody and the lack of strong climax (that is, the scene where Jeff returns home and Margie's attitude changes) is still due to the director. Among the three films that Dahua has shown consecutively recently ("New Moon," "Arise, My Love," and this "That Uncertain Feeling" all come from the same director), the best one should be "Arise, My Love." I think directing this kind of play is more in line with his style.

### Theater News

— He Tu

Gai Jiaotian's entry into the Golden Grand Theater has become a reality. In addition to performing several of his signature plays one by one, he also intends to rehearse the entire "Water Margin." This is one of his plans for coming out of retirement.

The drama group of the New Art Troupe held a round table meeting the day before yesterday at 3:00 PM, preparing to perform in the near future. The play has not yet been decided, and the location is also yet to be negotiated.

Li Wen, a young actor who went to Ningbo with Sui Yulian's troupe, is still singing at the Minguang Theater. He wrote to the reporter to report that the business performance is very good, so he does not want to return to Shanghai for the time being.
