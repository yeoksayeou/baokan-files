### US Colonel Lindbergh - Writes to the President - Resigns from Air Force Reserve - After Being Called a "Copperhead"

New York - President Roosevelt recently referred to Colonel Lindbergh as a copperhead when meeting with reporters. Copperhead is the name of an American poisonous snake. During the American Civil War, this name was given to those who advocated appeasement. The President criticized Lindbergh as a copperhead because Lindbergh made anti-British remarks, saying that Britain had already failed. The President also said that because Lindbergh had different views on the international situation, the government did not call him into service. Lindbergh, therefore, recently wrote to the President, resigning from the US Air Force Reserve. He wrote, "The remarks made by the President on April 25 at the White House press conference, concerning my reserve position, greatly disturbed me. I had hoped that I could exercise my right as an American citizen to express my opinions publicly in peacetime without giving up my position in the Air Force Reserve during wartime. However, since Your Excellency, in your capacity as President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, has clearly stated that I can no longer be used by the country, and has doubts about my loyalty and motives, I feel that there is no honorable way to resign from the position of Air Force Colonel. I take this action with great regret, as my relationship with the Air Force is one of the most important things in my life. However, I consider the civil right of my countrymen to freely discuss the current issues of war and peace to be even more important than this relationship. I will continue to serve the country to the best of my ability as a citizen." (29th Reuters Dispatch)

### America Prepares for War - Escort Operations Will Be Implemented Soon - Otherwise, the Lend-Lease Act Cannot Take Effect - Congressional Opposition Will Be Defeated

Washington - War to escort Britain is being prepared. Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast speech is generally regarded as having changed the concept of "supplying us with war materials" to a call for "delivering war materials to us." At the same time, oil tycoon Rockefeller's advocacy of escort operations and former Ambassador to France Bullitt's warning that even at the risk of war, Britain should be given full support are all powerful voices in favor of escort operations. Pro-British committees across the country have also responded to this call and have formed a new organization called "Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies." Its founders are writers, journalists, lawyers, advertising agents, and celebrities. They plan to petition Congress to patrol the Atlantic with a fleet and escort food and war materials, as the Lend-Lease Act cannot take effect otherwise. The attitude of Congress will be revealed when the anti-escort bill is submitted to the Senate committee tomorrow. It is expected that the anti-escort bill will be defeated. Although the decision to defeat it is still passive, it can help create public opinion for escort operations. According to informed sources, escort operations will be implemented soon. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

Washington - A congressional source said yesterday that it is heard that the United States' recent Atlantic northern neutrality patrol will extend to within five hundred miles of Britain. This source and other congressional sources reserved their criticism on whether this move would reduce the loss of dangerous ships. One source said that this is at most an incomplete method. The results of this patrol will seem to be reflected in the British Admiralty's ship loss reports. Some observers believe that if there is no significant reduction in ship losses, then only direct escort will do. Congressional sources said that they understand that US warships will patrol within the routes traveled by Allied ships. (29th United Press Dispatch)

Tokyo - Both the Sino-Foreign Business News and the National News claim that the United States' adoption of a patrol system to clear the sea lanes so that ships carrying ... and military supplies can travel from the US to Britain is the first step for the United States to move towards true participation in the war. Both newspapers believe that this patrol system is indeed no different from escorting, and they anticipate that US warships will inevitably clash with the German and Italian navies, especially submarines. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

New York - The Force Protection Freedom Society stated that the number of supporters of the society's proposal that the United States fully join the total war is increasing daily. The letters and telegrams of support received include those from former Ambassador to Germany Gerard, Groton School Principal Dr. Peabody, Motion Picture Association Secretary Thompson, actress Ethel Barrymore, celebrity Melville, and Douglass, among others. Louis, a member of the society's national policy discussion, Douglass declared and advocated that the United States escort in the Atlantic immediately. (29th United Press Dispatch)

Washington - The House Naval Affairs Committee yesterday approved the request of the Production Management Office, granting the Office broad powers to control all military raw materials for the British and American military supplies.

Editorial

### An Analysis of the European Struggle

The Balkan war has ended. In the overall war situation, this does not have a final decisive effect; in Britain, it is not the final moment of victory or defeat; but we cannot therefore ignore the importance of this war. Obviously, as long as the Balkan war continues for one day, Germany and Italy will be forced to fight on two fronts, east and west; the flank of Italy will be under serious threat for one day; and the situation in the British Isles, the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, and Africa can be temporarily eased; so the failure of Britain in the Balkans has a very significant impact on future strategies. However, the Balkan war is not enough to judge the superiority or inferiority of the two sides. The three-week process and outcome only proved two things: first, the German-Italian joint land and air forces have an advantage in the corner of the Balkans, and second, Britain currently does not have the intention and preparation to concentrate its forces and immediately engage in a decisive battle with Germany and Italy. The contrast in the superior and inferior situation between the two sides on land and sea is an unshakeable fact, and of course, any competition in any aspect is subject to this basic situation. Germany and Italy were able to defeat the British and French allied forces on the Western Front last year, and of course, it is not difficult to defeat the Anglo-Greek forces in the Balkans now; but further, if Germany and Italy cannot find a land route and rashly expand the war in Africa, or disregard everything and provoke a major Mediterranean war and attack the British Isles now, then their fate ofÊÉ®Ë¥• is of course destined long ago, needless to say.

In such a land and sea confrontation situation, the British Navy now almost completely controls all the sea surfaces surrounding Europe and Africa, and the only areas that can be further controlled by it are the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, and the Adriatic Sea. On the other hand, the German and Italian armies in continental Europe have now reached their highest peak of glory. If they do not rush into Soviet Ukraine and Turkey, then the only targets for their power to be exerted are the Iberian Peninsula's Spain and Portugal. Moreover, even in these land and sea areas, any possible developments and advances and retreats in the present and near future still cannot determine the success or failure of the two sides. Therefore, a stalemate will soon appear between the land and sea main forces of the two sides, and the final showdown will not be held immediately; but of course, air combat and the competition for military equipment will be intensified many times more than before. The recent major air raids by Britain and Germany against each other, as well as the British Prime Minister's emphasis on US air machinery supply, are meaningful in this.

Of course, stalemate does not mean stagnation. Although Britain and Germany cannot fight a decisive battle with each other for a while, they will certainly accelerate the expansion of their respective land and sea military equipment in preparation for the date of that great decisive battle; and at the same time, Britain, with its overwhelming naval superiority, can probably engage in the following tasks: (1) intensifying the blockade of continental Europe, attempting to gradually paralyze the German and Italian war mechanisms under the pressure of shortages of important raw materials and food, (2) ensuring its own maritime transport lines, so that the resources of all its colonies can be continuously organized and incorporated into its war mechanisms, especially important is to ensure the safety of maritime transport with the United States in the Atlantic. As for the German and Italian side, it is also bound to make full use of all its advantages to carry out: (1) slowly sneaking into Africa or the Near East with the army, attempting to gradually disintegrate the British Empire from the land, (2) taking advantage of the current slight superiority of the air force and submarines, desperately hammering British maritime shipping, (3) using all means to destroy the arrival of US supplies to the British Isles.

Although the success or failure of the two sides must be left to the overall results of the actual struggle in the future to answer, there is no need to predict now. But it is worth pointing out the importance of the role played by the United States and the Soviet Union in this great struggle. Leaving aside the role of American aid to Britain in the past, from now on, its role will of course become more and more important day by day, and it can even be said to hold the key to Britain's overall victory or defeat. In terms of materials, the United States is almost stronger than the sum of Germany and Italy. In terms of population, it is also roughly equivalent to the total number of Germany and Italy, even if limited to non-participation in the war, its 17 million enlistment-age youths can also be used as volunteers and in various other ways to join the British army to remedy one of Britain's greatest weaknesses against Germany and Italy. And in the current struggle between Britain and Germany for control of the Atlantic, the United States is in a very important position. Recently, all parties in the United States have clearly stated that the United States' contribution to Britain is not limited to manufacturing war equipment, but will also take responsibility for ensuring that it can safely reach the British Isles. With close cooperation between the British and American navies, the possibility of Germany and Italy succeeding in destroying their maritime transport in the Atlantic is very small. Looking at the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany and Italy, even if we put aside all future political developments, the mere economic and material cooperation has already made the British put unlimited hope in the decisive effect of the blockade against Germany and Italy, which has become a pie in the sky, assuming that this situation continues, then the date when Germany and Italy feel fatal pressure is very distant.

In short, although both Britain and Germany are intensifying their efforts to cultivate their own strength and search for the weaknesses of the other side in order to make a final strike; but if the attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union remain unchanged for a long time, then before the great reckoning, the whole world is probably destined to suffer prolonged pain and struggle.

(29th Haitong News Agency) Dr. V√©drine's Miraculous Medical Skills - The renowned French neurologist, Dr. V√©drine, has recently arrived in Shanghai and is residing at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund, where he is practicing medicine and restoring health. His miraculous skills are widely praised, creating a sensation throughout Shanghai. Dr. V√©drine is the inventor of a new therapy, truly a revolutionary pioneer in medicine. He treats patients without the aid of drugs; instead, by simply contacting the end of the sympathetic nervous system within the nasal mucus, he can cure diseases. This is because this major nerve controls the functions of all our organs. When this nerve is in good condition, we are healthy; when it is not, we are ill; when it ceases to function, we die. - Dr. V√©drine uses extremely simple medical instruments, only a few small metal rods. During diagnosis and treatment, he first asks the patient to sit before him, uses a light to examine the nostrils, and touches various points inside the nose with the small rods. The patient experiences no pain, only slight moisture in the eyes and a slightly red face, sometimes sneezing, which indicates a good response to the treatment. This novel medical technique achieves astonishing results, especially for chronic illnesses that were previously considered incurable, such as asthma, chronic rheumatism, and epilepsy, all of which can be miraculously cured. - Asthma is the condition most frequently and effectively treated by Dr. V√©drine. Patients often experience immediate relief or significant reduction in breathing difficulties after his treatment. According to statistics Dr. V√©drine gathered during his practice in Paris, 80 out of every 100 patients were either cured or had their suffering greatly reduced. Other ailments, such as asthmatic cough, chronic nasal catarrh, and hay fever, can also be cured by this new therapy. - Furthermore, Dr. V√©drine's miraculous skills are effective for various neurological disorders. New and old headaches disappear after a few treatments. Insomnia and nightmares are resolved with diagnosis and treatment, leading to restful sleep. Fainting, tremors, and palpitations can all be cured. Even nervous weakness can be treated to restore peace of mind, confidence, and normalcy. Dr. V√©drine declares, "Over the past ten years, I have treated thousands of patients with a wide range of complex ailments. Generally, patients tend to exaggerate their conditions, distrusting others and themselves, causing them to laugh or get angry for no reason. They often experience headaches, stomach aches, indigestion, insomnia, and even fear riding in cars or crossing the street. Some are prone to panic attacks, confusion, and depression. All these conditions are caused by weakness and dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system, which my technique can restore to normalcy within days." Dr. V√©drine is also capable of correcting physical weakness and mental retardation in children. Therefore, laziness in children is a symptom of illness and should be treated early rather than scolded. - The new "nasal membrane contact" therapy can also alleviate pain, such as rheumatic bone pain, back pain, and nerve pain inside and out. - It is also remarkably effective for treating indigestion. Patients suffering from stomach pain or drowsiness after meals often endure strict diets, which they find distressing. After Dr. V√©drine's treatment, they can eat normally without suffering. - Problems with blood circulation, such as high blood pressure and menstrual issues, can also be resolved after a few treatments. Moreover, Dr. V√©drine's miraculous skills have achieved astonishing results in treating paralysis, especially hemiplegia and Parkinson's disease. Patients with Parkinson's disease suffer from stiff bodies, slow movements, and tremors. These conditions are often considered incurable by other physicians but can be improved with Dr. V√©drine's "nasal membrane contact" technique, thereby improving their health. As for premature aging and sexually transmitted diseases, this technique is remarkably effective, with the potential to rejuvenate the body. - Epilepsy is also considered an incurable disease, but Dr. V√©drine has cured many people in recent months. After treatment, patients experience reduced seizures, gradually decreasing the frequency of epileptic episodes until they disappear completely. - In conclusion, the "nasal membrane contact" therapy is powerful, treating a wide range of ailments, and providing hope for those suffering from previously incurable conditions. With Dr. V√©drine's treatment, they can turn danger into safety, grief into joy, and transform disappointment and despair into a life of happiness and self-assurance, enjoying the pleasures of life. - However, Dr. V√©drine takes a cautious approach and does not proceed with treatment recklessly. He first examines the patient to assess the reactivity of their nervous system before deciding on a course of action. Those treated by Dr. V√©drine can be assured of complete or significant relief, as he understands the importance of thorough preparation and successful completion. - Dr. V√©drine is a scientific expert, a graduate of the University of Paris School of Medicine, and has served as a physician in major hospitals. His renowned new technique is based on scientific principles, allowing patients to feel secure and comfortable under his care. Since arriving in Shanghai, he has enabled countless disappointed and despairing individuals to regain their original state and thrive once more. - Patients wishing to seek treatment from Dr. V√©drine can visit Room 707 at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM or 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM daily (excluding Saturday afternoons and Sundays). - Dr. V√©drine will deliver a lecture in English on asthma and respiratory diseases on Friday at 8:05 PM on the Great American Evening Post Radio Station (XMHC, 700 kHz), which is expected to draw a large audience interested in his medical insights.

US-UK-Dutch Cooperation to Protect Shipping Routes - More US Bombers Arrive in the Philippines - Plans to Utilize Dutch East Indies Submarines - Manila - Eight U.S. aviators and four light bombers assigned to the U.S. Army in the Philippines have arrived aboard the cruiser "Mariana." These bombers have been assigned to the first detachment of new aircraft, and it is rumored that even more will arrive within the next three months. According to reliable sources, several long-range patrol bombers have been deployed to Singapore via Manila, Guam and the Dutch East Indies, Canton Island, New Caledonia, Australia, and the Dutch East Indies. The Navy has refused to disclose the number of aircraft that have arrived in Singapore, but has said that the number has doubled, since three Consolidated bombers arrived in Singapore last week. These bombers will be used by British and Dutch authorities to patrol the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, protecting against Axis raids, as it is widely believed that the Axis powers will soon launch a new attack in this vast area. Authorities also state that many German ships have been used for this attack, some of which are currently docked in Japanese ports, while others are said to have been hidden in Japanese-mandated islands since November and December of last year. It is also believed that this Axis attack will coincide with the African war. With the United States expanding its patrol range around the Philippines and the British and Dutch authorities acquiring long-range patrol aircraft, naval officials believe that these three countries are cooperating to protect new shipping routes from Asia to the Red Sea and defend against German raiding ships, thus securing the passage of U.S. vessels. However, it is not yet known whether U.S. supply ships are currently using this route. The recent arrival in Manila of two U.S. military equipment experts is indicative of U.S., British, and Dutch cooperation. These two experts had previously spent three months in the Dutch East Indies planning military equipment matters, with a particular focus on submarine issues, as both the U.S. and the Dutch have strong submarine forces in the Far East. It is also reported that these two experts have instructed Dutch East Indies merchant seamen on how to use magnetic mine defense equipment, as several magnetic mines have been discovered in the South Pacific. It is believed that these mines were dropped by German aircraft.

Afterwards Curtin stated that they had a detailed and frank discussion on international affairs, and that he would pay a return visit to Kawai. (29th Reuters Dispatch) - Sydney - Australian Foreign Secretary Sir Frederick Stewart said today that Australia is very pleased to accept the friendly assurances expressed yesterday in Melbourne by the Japanese Minister Kawai, saying that Japan has no intention of taking action against Australia, and that mutual guarantees were given. However, Australia cannot ignore the important fact that Japan is an allied nation of Germany and Italy, with which it is at war alongside Britain. (29th Reuters Dispatch) Malaya Facing Threat of Invasion, Defenses Greatly Strengthened - Singapore - The Commander of the British Forces in Malaya, General Pownall, told reporters yesterday that Malaya is definitely in danger of being invaded, and that it would be foolish to think otherwise. Malayan defenses have greatly strengthened since he took office in July 1939. When reporters asked for comparative figures, Pownall smiled and did not answer, only saying that two years ago there were only garrisons defending Singapore, but now garrisons are spread throughout the Malay Peninsula. "We no longer only think of defending Singapore," he said. When asked about the continuing arrival of reinforcements, he said that it is well known that there are a large number of fresh troops available and that virtually every ship brings new troops. When asked about U.S. assistance, he replied that U.S. planes, machine guns, and transport vehicles have been received, but no other military supplies. The Malayan Air Force has been greatly strengthened and is essential to defense because any invading force must rely on nearby bases to launch air strikes. (29th United Press Dispatch) British Plymouth Continues to Suffer Brutal Air Raids - Dover Strait Long-Range Guns Roar - London - Plymouth, which was bombed for three consecutive nights last week, was attacked again last night by German planes. Multiple incendiary bombs were dropped within the first fifteen minutes, followed by oil bombs and high explosives. Anti-aircraft fire was intense. The air raid lasted for several hours. Although the situation was quite intense, there have been no reports of casualties so far. It is believed that two German planes were shot down. It is reported that a city on the south coast was also attacked. (29th Reuters Dispatch) - Plymouth - The people of Plymouth are searching through the rubble of buildings for the bodies of relatives and salvaged items. In the evening, hundreds of survivors fled the burning city to spend the night in schools, warehouses, and homes in the hills outside the city. Some even slept outdoors. The air raids on Sunday night and Monday morning were shorter than usual, but in half an hour, high-explosive bombs rained down every few seconds. Dozens of streets in one area of the city were completely destroyed, and countless people were killed. A hotel was bombed, and many guests were buried inside. Rescue teams are still searching for bodies, but another bomb fell, killing seven rescuers. Three hospitals were destroyed. One German plane was shot down at sea, and another was also destroyed. (29th United Press Dispatch) - London - Today, Dover was bombarded by enemy long-range guns, the intensity of which was the most severe since last autumn. After three hours of bombardment, the Germans switched from single-gun shelling to simultaneous firing of four to six guns, once every three minutes. British long-range guns also returned fire several times towards the French coast. (29th Reuters Dispatch) Greek Funds in the US Frozen - Washington - Roosevelt yesterday signed an order freezing all Greek funds in the United States. Greek funds in the United States total $40 million, bringing the total foreign funds frozen by the United States to $45 million. (29th United Press Dispatch) Random Notes on the European War (49) The Hardships and Joys of Desert Warfare - The battlefields of North and East Africa are approximately the size of the European continent. The British army currently operates in at least four areas: Libya, Eritrea, Abyssinia, and Somaliland. Because of their differing longitudes and latitudes, each area has a different climate. For example, Libya is extremely cold, while Somaliland is scorching. Therefore, the equipment brought by the British forces reinforcing the Mediterranean coast is entirely unsuitable. This is true not only for the infantry, but also for the mechanized units and transport corps, which are significantly affected by the terrain. Vehicles suitable for use in Libya are not suitable for the rugged terrain of Abyssinia. In such places, the only way to transport supplies is by using camels or mules. - Libya is unbearably cold, with temperatures often below freezing. The southeasterly winds blowing from the desert plateau are as scorching as a furnace in the summer, but piercingly cold in the winter. - It is extremely difficult to fire a gun at any time in the desert. Rifles and machine gun barrels are often filled with sand. The Arabs are accustomed to wrapping the gun barrels in rags and plugging the muzzles to prevent sand from entering. However, if ambushed by enemy reconnaissance teams while marching, they would be caught off guard and suffer at their hands. - In addition, there is no shelter in the cold desert nights except for the cisterns dug out of gray stone in ancient Roman times. During the day, the wind whips up sand and hundreds of vehicles drive through the sandstorms, making it impossible to distinguish directions within a few feet, as if one were in a dense forest. After walking only a few hundred yards, the eyes, nostrils, and throat are filled with sand, causing suffocation. - Desert warfare is also different from land warfare, with only naval warfare being comparable. In naval battles, the location of the battle is irrelevant, and even crossing borders is not a major concern. As long as the enemy ship is defeated, it does not matter how far they advance. The only strategy in desert warfare is to inflict heavy damage on the enemy forces, causing the greatest possible loss of manpower and resources, with the ultimate goal of exhausting and defeating the enemy. - There is far less to say about desert warfare than about warfare on fertile land. Soldiers fighting in the desert must endure every kind of suffering that humans can encounter and have only emotional or aesthetic consolation. - Despite its many difficulties, desert warfare also has its fascinating aspects. Many of the greatest contributions to the history of human struggle have come from warriors who have undergone rigorous training in the desert. - The beauty and abhorrence of the desert are unparalleled. A reporter who has inspected the desert regions of western Egypt, where General Wavell's troops of the British Middle East Command are operating, feels that although it is desolate, the beautiful scenery gives one the feeling that living there for the rest of one's life would be infinitely enjoyable. However, upon revisiting the same place a few hours later, it feels no different than a wasteland of rubble, with dark, stunted trees resembling stone cats crouching and waiting to be fed. - The above recollections are not entirely without purpose; they can explain why even the most insensitive person in the desert will complain about the discomfort they suffer, but is unwilling to be transferred to fight elsewhere, because desert warfare relies on a passion, a fighting spirit that is sometimes unseen in other theaters of war. Of course, desert warfare is often nothing more than a solace for boredom and loneliness, but sometimes desert life makes people feel small, thus making their innate abilities more acute. - Even the desert traversed by the British forces along the Nile is not as grand as the Arabian Desert, but the hardships it imposes on humans are no different. Extreme heat, extreme cold‚Äîalthough the temperature in the sandy oases rarely drops below forty degrees, it often feels like forty degrees below freezing‚Äîlack of drinking water, lack of shade, and the scorching sun and torrential rains are extremely dangerous for those who do not take care of themselves. - The most dangerous thing in the desert is the wind. When the "Khamsin" wind blows from the equatorial region, carrying sand, the air is filled with a thick orange haze, making it impossible to see beyond fifteen feet. At this time, only by wearing a mask can one breathe air that is not contaminated with dust. - The wind is so strong that it can blow military vehicles off course as easily as it knocks down tents. However, it is a great messenger of peace; as soon as the wind rises, the fighting between the two armies will immediately stop, and at this time people think only of avoiding suffocation. - At this time, the temperature rises sharply, the terrestrial landscape gradually disappears, dust and sand obscure the sky, and the raging waves of the Mediterranean Sea strike the cliffs and coasts like cannons, forcing even naval warfare to stop. - Although the Khamsin comes suddenly, it also goes quickly. In an instant, the yellow haze that covers the sky returns to the earth, and the battle resumes. - In the winter, the surface of the desert is sometimes frozen, and the north wind howls, blowing along the dry riverbeds, past the tops of cliffs and precipices, and striking the face like a knife. These are the two major disasters of the desert. Although human ingenuity has overcome countless difficulties, it has so far been unable to cope with these two.

Amidst Solemn Atmosphere, General Xie Jinyuan Laid to Rest - Mourners Extended Dozens of Zhang - Regimental Commander Shangguan, Ill, Returned to Camp to Pay Respects - The remains of the national hero General Xie Jinyuan were laid to rest yesterday. At noon yesterday, the Lone Army Camp held the coffin-closing ceremony for General Xie, forever ending the chance to see his heroic demeanor and sincere personality, which can now only linger in the memories of everyone. The number of people from all walks of life who went to the Lone Army Camp yesterday to pay their respects to his remains and attend the ceremony was even more crowded, with people lining up to enter and exit continuously for as long as five hours, totaling more than 60,000 people. The tragic situation was unprecedented, demonstrating the indomitable spirit of the Chinese nation. The details are as follows: - 60,000 Mourners in an Endless Line - Starting early yesterday morning, crowds surged along Singapore Road, coming from all directions. From Xiaoshadu Road to the front of the Lone Army Camp, a line of people stretched for dozens of zhang, mostly students, workers, and office staff, with a very large number. The mourners held banners and floral tributes high in the air. To maintain order, the police authorities completely sealed off Jiaozhou Road Changping Road, Jiaozhou Road Singapore Road, and the western side of Singapore Road near the Lone Army Camp with iron nets, opening only Singapore Road for the public to enter and exit, with more than a dozen police officers stationed along the road. The crowds entered the camp hall to pay their respects to the remains. Because the number of people was over 60,000, entry and exit were difficult. The bamboo fence of the Shanghai Municipal Council Primary School next to the Lone Army Camp was dismantled to create an open path as an exit. - The Camp Inside and Out Was a Sea of White - Yesterday, the Lone Army Camp received a large number of elegiac couplets and banners from all walks of life, which were hung all over the inside and outside of the camp, creating a white, solemn atmosphere. Wreaths and flowers were piled up like mountains. Above the hall hung a painted oil portrait of General Xie in military uniform, donated by Ms. Yang Huimin (who sent the national flag to the Sihang Warehouse during the August 13th War), nearly a zhang in size, imposing respect. Yesterday, due to the excessive number of people and the limited size of the hall, many visitors left the camp after paying their respects to the remains, leaving only about 10,000 people to attend the coffin-closing ceremony, which was originally scheduled for 11:00 AM but was delayed until 12:00 PM due to the overwhelming number of people paying their respects. - The Coffin-Closing Ceremony Was Solemn and Tragic - At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Regimental Commander Shangguan Zhibiao, who was injured while pursuing the murderer and was recuperating in the hospital, was assisted back to the camp to pay his respects. He cried bitterly before General Xie's coffin and then bid farewell and returned to the hospital. When the coffin-closing ceremony began, all the Lone Army soldiers and guests gathered in the hall. After everyone stood in silence, the band played mournful music, and the presiding officer, Regimental Commander Lei, took his place, sang the national anthem, and bowed three times to the Party and national flag and General Xie's portrait. After a three-minute silence, flowers and fruits were offered, followed by a viewing of the remains. All the Lone Army soldiers and guests circled the coffin in turn. At this time, mournful music was played again, the tone of which was mournful. Many people, whether they knew him or not, wept bitterly. Amid this sea of crying, the coffin was closed, and many of General Xie's friends prostrated themselves before the coffin, unable to rise, and some wept loudly on the coffin. The scene was extremely tragic. The ceremony ended at 2:00 PM. General Xie's coffin will remain temporarily in the hall, covered with the national flag, until preparations are complete and the burial site is selected. - The Memorial Service Will Limit the Number of Attendees - The Lone Army Camp is scheduled to hold a memorial service for Regimental Commander Xie on May 3rd. The funeral committee, in order to maintain order, has decided to limit the number of attendees, stipulating that each organization can send four representatives to participate. A registration office has been established, and organizations can go to the camp starting immediately to obtain admission passes. News reporters will be issued separate press passes. The memorial service will be held at 11:00 AM that morning. In the afternoon, there will be a group memorial service by various organizations, with no limit on the number of attendees. Several memorial songs for Regimental Commander Xie have been received, and it has now been decided to adopt one composed by a certain gentleman. A music instructor is currently training soldiers in the camp to sing it on the 3rd. - Western Newspapers Comment with Admiration - The "Continental Daily News" commented that when the body of Xie Jinyuan, the Lone Army Commander who was murdered last week by four rebel soldiers, was laid to rest, nearly 20,000 Chinese people went to pay their respects, demonstrating the admiration for him. Chairman Chiang has ordered the remittance of 50,000 yuan to provide for General Xie's family, and General Xie's children will be educated by the government, demonstrating the government's generous treatment. Why is this? In late October 1937, when Chinese troops were withdrawing from the west, General Xie led the Lone Army in a final, strong resistance in the Sihang Warehouse. General Xie had intended to sacrifice himself for his country, but the authorities in the International Settlement requested Chairman Chiang to consider the safety of the settlement and ordered General Xie to lead his troops to withdraw. General Xie obeyed the order and reluctantly entered the International Settlement from the Sihang Warehouse. His subordinates were trapped in the Lone Army Camp on Singapore Road. Now, General Xie has been killed by rebel soldiers, ending the life of this outstanding hero of the Sino-Japanese War. It is a tragedy. However, it is important to emphasize that the heroic deeds of the Lone Army are enough to inspire the spirit of the Chinese nation and arouse the feelings of foreigners, and can serve as a model of the Chinese spirit of sacrifice. - Our Readers Contribute from Their Salaries to Express Condolences - The workers of a certain iron factory, readers of this newspaper, contributed 97 yuan from one day's wages yesterday and sent it to this newspaper to be forwarded to the Lone Army Camp as condolences. Their original letter stated: "To the esteemed Editor, we were shocked and saddened to read the report that Regimental Commander Xie was assassinated and suddenly passed away. We deeply mourn his loss. We, the undersigned, remember the bravery of the Regimental Commander in defending the Sihang Warehouse in those difficult years, which was a model for our country's soldiers. Now, to be harmed by his subordinates, we are very angry and saddened. We have contributed one day's wages, totaling 97 yuan and 5 jiao, and send it to your newspaper, hoping that you will forward it on our behalf. Although the amount is small, it is a small token of our deep respect." Coal Prices Rise Again - Yesterday, after the coal market opened, the market situation was quite tight, and major hoarders still insisted on hoarding large quantities, waiting for high prices to sell. As a result, the black market continued to rise, and the highest grade of Deli white coal was quoted at 444 yuan per ton, reaching a peak. The black market price of coal briquettes also continued to rise, once quoted at 310 yuan per ton. However, major coal briquette companies still maintained the original price of 296 yuan, and the retail price was 16 yuan per dan (100 market catties). Charity Shelter for the Poor Will Close Today - The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, which established a shelter for the poor last winter in Yanjiazhai, Difeng Road, Hongqiao, has been operating for nearly five months. It was originally scheduled to close at the end of last month, but due to the uncertain climate in the city, it was extended for one month. It will be closed at the end of this month (today). The poor people who are generally housed will be given some funds and dismissed to seek their own livelihoods. May Day Tomorrow - All Workers in the City Celebrate - Joint Defense of the Two Settlements Begins Simultaneously in May - Tomorrow is International Labor Day. Workers in all industries in the city have decided to take a day off to celebrate this great, glorious, and sacred festival, as per tradition. Due to the limitations of the environment, no rallies will be held. With unwavering, solemn, and enthusiastic emotions and intentions, they will support resistance and construction, and be loyal to the Party and the country. They have decided to jointly send a telegram to Chairman Chiang to pay their respects and to comfort the front lines. All factories will be closed for one day, as per tradition, and all wages will be paid to show cooperation between labor and capital. All major Chinese and foreign newspapers in the city will also take a day off. Joint Defense of the Settlements Begins Tomorrow Morning - The police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, because tomorrow is the first day of the May Revolution and also International Labor Day, and workers in all industries will take a day off as per tradition, and because there are many labor strikes in Shanghai and rumors that unscrupulous elements will take advantage of this day to commit excesses in the settlement areas, have decided to begin "May Joint Defense" at 5:00 AM tomorrow. The two settlements will take simultaneous steps to prevent illegal activities, dispatching all police personnel, national defense forces, and the International Settlement Volunteer Corps to carry out necessary preventive work during the commemorative festival (including blocking roads, alleys, and bridges, searching pedestrians and vehicles, and public places). Tomorrow morning at 5:00 AM, some unnecessary roads will be blocked, and barbed wire obstacles will be added, until midnight of the same day, and the measures will continue on the dawn of the 3rd (because the 3rd is the anniversary of the Jinan Massacre). On the other hand, during this month, (1) the curfew law will be strictly enforced (between 12:30 AM and 5:00 AM, no one is allowed to walk on the road without a curfew pass, and violators will be detained at the police station), (2) no organization is allowed to hold meetings, form associations, parade, or demonstrate without the permission of the settlement authorities, and (3) undercover police will be stationed in all public places to monitor. Tuberculosis Prevention Campaign Scheduled to End Today - The second tuberculosis prevention campaign in the city, which began on the 16th of this month, with the cooperation of 18 hospitals including Hongqiao and China-Belgium, is holding free X-ray examinations for half a month, and has also obtained the support of the city's Western medicine industry, setting preferential measures to benefit patients. This measure is to eradicate the great enemy of human diseases, improve the health of citizens, and benefit the public. It is reported that since the campaign began, many citizens have been going to hospitals in the city every day to register for examinations. However, because each hospital limits the number of examinations each day, many people are unable to get them. Today is the last day of the free X-ray examinations. A reporter from Pingming News visited the person in charge of the Tuberculosis Prevention Association yesterday and learned that this tuberculosis prevention campaign has been held with the assistance of major hospitals and pharmacies in the city, and the results are commendable. The exact statistics on the number of people who have participated in the examination in the past fourteen days and the tuberculosis situation are not yet available, but according to the reports of various hospitals, it is estimated that about 8,000 people have participated in the examination, of which 30% are confirmed to have tuberculosis, half of whom have severe symptoms. If they can be properly treated, there is hope for recovery. As for those whose conditions are too severe and there is no possibility of medical recovery, they account for about one-fifth of the total. The person in charge added that this expanded tuberculosis prevention campaign has not yet aroused the attention of all citizens. It is hoped that all sectors can do their best to promote it when the third campaign begins next year. Maiden Voyage of the USS President Hayes - The U.S. President Lines Company's six newly built world-class mail ships, the Jackson and Monroe, have already set sail, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the third new mail ship, the President Hayes, has also been completed. At the beginning of last month, the maiden voyage was to the east, departing from Boston, via New York, Havana, Cristobal, Balboa, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Honolulu, and to Kobe, Japan, and is scheduled to arrive in port today at 3:30 PM, berthing at buoys 11 and 12. Passengers will be transferred to the company's prepared small launches and land at the New Customs Wharf at about 4:30 PM today. The new ship will stay in Shanghai overnight and set sail tomorrow at 11:30 AM (i.e., the evening of May 1st) to Hong Kong, Little Luzon, via Singapore, Penang, Colombo, Bombay, Cape Town, Trinidad, and return to New York and Boston, following the original planned global voyage. Due to the outbreak of the European war and the closure of the Suez Canal, it will return to the United States via Bombay. The launch for passengers will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 10:00 PM tomorrow night. The new mail ships have the same tonnage and style, with only first-class cabins and a total of 77 passengers, of which 24 will disembark in Shanghai and 53 will continue on to Nanyang and around the world. The company originally planned to invite all sectors to visit the new ship, but due to these extraordinary times, it has cancelled the visit, as it did with the previous two new ships. Sentinel Shot by Gunfire - Seriously Injured - The English "Great American Evening Post" reported that the Japanese authorities are investigating a case in which a Japanese Marine Corps sentry was shot at around 8:20 PM last night (28th) at the New Gate Bridge. At the time, the sentry was on duty near the bridgehead when a lone assailant approached and fired several shots. The Japanese sentry was shot in the upper abdomen and injured. The assailant is believed to have fled into the Public Concession. Moments later, a large number of Japanese military police rushed to the scene, cordoned off the area around the incident, and, together with the Marine Corps soldiers patrolling the New Gate area, closed off the bridges and conducted a thorough search, but did not capture the assailant. The "North China Daily News" also reported that the Japanese sentry was shot six times by the assailant, with at least one bullet hitting him in the abdomen. He staggered for a few steps, intending to take refuge in the guardhouse, but collapsed after only a few steps. He was then taken to a Japanese hospital, where he is in serious condition. Coffin-Closing Ceremony for Commander Xie - The coffin-closing ceremony for Commander Xie Jinyuan was held at noon yesterday. 60,000 mourners lined up for dozens of zhang (top picture) is the scene of mourners entering the camp and walking into the hall (bottom picture) many of the onlookers cried bitterly during the coffin-closing ceremony. The picture shows one moment during the coffin closing. (Kang Zuyi Photography) Rice Prices Soar Daily - The Seriousness Reaches Its Peak - If Not Stopped, It Will Shake People's Hearts - Can the City's Safety Be Allowed to Be Ignored? - Since the authorities ordered the removal of price limits on domestic and foreign rice, there are no restrictions on the buying and selling of rice in the rice market. Rice merchants can freely set prices when releasing rice, resulting in domestic and foreign rice prices continuing to rise, and the market situation is chaotic and the public is nervous, which can be described as unprecedented. The authorities' removal of price limits has failed to achieve the original intention of regulating food supply. After the rice market opened yesterday, the market situation became increasingly chaotic. - Rice prices were raised higher and higher by rice brokers, and rice shops hoarded goods, resulting in a shortage of spot goods in the market. At the beginning of the market, high-grade tribute rice was fiercely raised by 150 yuan per shi, reaching a peak, and second-grade goods were also priced as high as 145-6 yuan per shi. Later, due to a slight reduction in demand, high-grade goods fell back by two yuan. However, this rapid advance in rice prices was purely due to rice brokers' manipulation. Brokers also resumed their intermediary role yesterday. In addition, - Thailand Shipping - The first trial voyage of the Shanghai-bound Xisheng Tong, belonging to the company, carried 40,000 bags of Thai rice to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 27th, but due to severe weather encountered during the voyage, the journey was delayed. It is now learned that the ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on Thursday morning and berth at the Longmao Foreign Firm's Pudong Wharf, where it will berth until the next morning before unloading. According to the company's news, Thai ships will henceforth be dedicated to sailing between Shanghai and Bangkok, Thailand, mainly transporting rice. Its sister ship, Xilica, will follow in mid-May, carrying a large amount of rice. U.S. Chamber of Commerce - Entertains Business Corps Members - More Than 400 Participants - The "North China Daily News" reported that the Shanghai U.S. Chamber of Commerce held a banquet at the U.S. General Assembly on Friday evening to entertain the U.S. team of the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps, and specially screened war films to entertain the guests. More than 400 people, including members of the U.S. business corps and guests, attended the banquet. Chamber of Commerce Acting President Nichols delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the directors and members, first apologizing for the limited space and inability to entertain all members of the business corps, and then praising the members of the business corps for serving the community and maintaining the security of the Public Concession, and thanking them on behalf of U.S. businessmen and all U.S. citizens. Business Strike - Talks Will Resume Today - Regarding the business strike, Ms. Xingde of the Industrial Section and Mr. Lu Gaoyi convened a formal conversation with the labor representatives at the Municipal Council the day before yesterday. The results of the discussion determined that the

### Thai Soldiers Fight, Relying on Divine Protection; Soldiers Wear Red Clothes, Said to be Bulletproof

Bangkok: According to investigations by this reporter, Buddhism played a very important role in the Thai-Vietnamese War, which recently concluded with a conference in Tokyo. Many Thai soldiers believe they will not be killed by the enemy because they have divine protection to defend against enemy guns and cannons. During the war, Buddhist monks were very busy manufacturing so-called "red clothes." It is said that wearing the "red clothes" makes one bulletproof. These red clothes all have Buddha images on them and, after being made, are prayed over by monks in a special ceremony. It is said that the Bangkok infantry battalion, which occupied Champasak and participated in the first un-and war, had these clothes as protective amulets. It is also said that because they had this treasure, the number of deaths and injuries was almost non-existent. Soldiers returning from the front admit that some soldiers wearing these red clothes were injured, but they believe that this was only because the French bullets were too tightly compressed and did not penetrate the red clothes. However, it has also been heard that many soldiers were killed by French machine-gun fire. Many Thai doctors who returned to Bangkok after being at the front for some time expressed doubts about this divine art. After the ceasefire, according to news reported here, a Japanese officer dispatched from a Japanese warship stationed here conducted experiments on these talismanic clothes. A Thai soldier wearing red clothes allowed him to experiment on him. The Japanese man fired a pistol at the Thai soldier from a very short distance. However, when the gun was fired, the bullet jammed in the gun and could not come out. So the Japanese officer pointed the gun at the sky and fired, and with a bang, the bullet left the gun and soared into the sky. However, some people say that when the Japanese officer was about to shoot the Thai soldier in red clothes, he had already put the safety on the gun, and later he took off the safety and fired it into the sky. It is also heard that Thai soldiers who could not get the red clothes would nail a Buddha image on their clothes to avoid disasters. It is said that this kind of Buddha image has been used by Thai soldiers and civilians for more than a hundred years, and most of the ones used by soldiers now are from a hundred years ago, and were unearthed from the ancient ruins of Ayutthaya. Therefore, during the recent Thai-Vietnamese War, many of the protective items worn by Thai soldiers may have been taken from the necks of Thai soldiers who resisted the Burmese troops who destroyed the capital Ayutthaya in 1767. Even the supreme Thai commander recognizes that the "Three Jewels" of Buddhism have great power. The so-called "Three Jewels" are "Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha," that is, the trinity of Buddhism. In the recent Thai-Vietnamese War, the final words of each communique issued by the Supreme Command of Thailand were "By the power of the Three Jewels, there will be no casualties among the Thai army."

### County Councilors and Township Representatives: Examination Committee Begins Selection; Expected to Need to Select Approximately Five Million Candidates; Examination Method Divided into Two Types: Examination and Review

Chongqing: The Examination Yuan's Examination and Selection Committee has begun conducting the review of candidates for county councilors and township representatives, as previously reported. This reporter believes that this matter is still an innovation in the history of China's examination system. In order to understand the significance and methods of implementing the examination of candidates for county councilors and township representatives, a special visit was made to the person in charge of the Examination Committee to inquire about various matters. I received a detailed reply, which can be summarized as follows: The system of examination for candidates for public office was originally created by the Founding Father. Following the will of the Founding Father, it is clear that administering examinations to candidates for public office not only does not restrict the right of citizens to be elected, but also compensates for the shortcomings of the election system and promotes the spirit of true equality. It is a prerequisite for promoting democracy. The laws and regulations for the election of county councilors are being actively discussed by the legislative body and will soon be promulgated and implemented. Provinces under the new county system that are still seeking to establish local public opinion organs are waiting to plan and establish them. County councilors and township representatives are representatives of the people. The significance of requiring these candidates to pass examinations and obtain qualifications is, of course, as important as mentioned above. Considering that the country is vast and the number of county councilors and township representatives is large, the government has set particularly lenient qualifications and simplified procedures in order to give the general public an opportunity to participate in government. It is expected that approximately five million candidates will need to be examined. The Examination Committee is determined to complete this public office candidate examination system with its greatest efforts. The examination method is divided into two types: examination and review. The examination is not limited to examinations, and the review is not a procedure prior to the examination. The two run in parallel, with different approaches but the same goal. According to regulations, examinations are conducted in writing and can be entrusted to the provincial governments. Recently, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hubei, Henan, and other provinces have successively sent telegrams to discuss examination methods, and examinations will soon be held. For the review, it is only necessary to review qualification documents, and tests or oral examinations will be conducted if necessary. If the review is passed, the candidate can obtain the qualifications for that position and does not need to take the examination again. During the election, they can be elected as county councilors or township representatives. The review is handled by the Qualification Review Committee and has long been approved to begin. Letters from all parties requesting to obtain the application review guidelines and forms have been very enthusiastic and have been sent out separately. Those who aspire to be county councilors or township representatives but have not yet obtained the forms can still write directly to the Chongqing Examination and Selection Committee to obtain them, or go to the local county government or designated district office or township office to obtain samples and copy them in the same format. They can apply for review at any time. (29th Dispatch)

### North African Sandstorms Rage; Allied Offensive on Egyptian Border Stalled; Fall of Fort Sollum Confirmed; Italian Resistance in East Africa Approaching Collapse

London: According to the latest news received here this afternoon, the enemy forces attacking Egypt across the border have now been halted by severe sandstorms. It is reported that in some places, it is impossible to see beyond fifty yards, and the situation is likely to worsen. People in Cairo generally say that these sandstorms are extremely beneficial to the British army, as the British army currently has far more experience in desert warfare than the German and Italian armies. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

Cairo: The fall of Sollum was acknowledged yesterday by the British side here. The battle for Alexandria and the Suez Canal appears to be about to unfold with full force. The main objective of the Axis forces in occupying Sollum is to advance to Musa Mandra, which is 130 miles east of Sollum and the starting point of the railway to Alexandria and the Suez Canal. According to military sources here, two columns of Axis armored forces used a large encirclement maneuver to break through Sollum and defeat its defenders. It is reported that the British Air Force in the Middle East has stepped up its bombing and strafing of Axis warships, aircraft, and troop transports carrying troops to land in Panina. According to official reports, one troop transport suffered heavy casualties, and other ships were severely damaged. The British occupation of the stage suggests that the resistance of the Italian army in East Africa will collapse. People here do not deny the serious situation of defending the Suez Canal, and if the Axis powers occupy the canal, it will be a major blow to the European war. However, it is said that the military situation is not necessarily more serious than what the British army has already experienced. The battle of Egypt will be beneficial to the British army and the imperial army. (29th International Dispatch)

Cairo: The British headquarters issued a public statement this afternoon: (1) The British army in Greece continues to retreat. (2) No important events to report in Tobruk. (3) Since crossing the border, the enemy forces in Sollum have been stalled and are often harassed by British reconnaissance teams. (4) In Abyssinia, the British army is making satisfactory progress on all fronts. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

Cairo: Responsible officials in Cairo stated that after the enemy forces crossed the Egyptian border from Libya at the end of the week, the border outpost of Sollum is thought to have fallen into enemy hands. Military sources in Cairo are very pleased with the capture of Taiz in northern Abyssinia. Taiz is located at the intersection of the roads leading from Addis Ababa and northwest to Gondar. Gondar is still being held by Italian forces, and the road from there leads northeast to the port of Asab on the Red Sea. Taiz fell to the British army after the Italian troops stationed there were defeated at the Kampo Erchia Pass, fourteen miles south of the city. Part of the Italian garrison may have retreated to Gondar, north of Lake Tana. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

### First Batch of Australian Troops Arrive Safely in Egypt; Greek Air Force Determined to Continue Fighting

London: Since Australian Secretary of War Spender announced that the British Imperial Army in Greece had begun its withdrawal, there has been no official news about the situation in Greece. According to Vichy, citing a dispatch from Rome, Roman newspapers reported that the first batch of the British Expeditionary Force in Greece had landed in Alexandria. At the same time, Greek officials announced that the Greek Air Force was determined to continue fighting against the Axis powers, and all Greek merchant ships, approximately one million tons, have now been placed under the control of the British government. The British Air Force continues to carry out extensive activities. A British Air Force communique in the Middle East stated that several German troop transport planes carrying troops landed in Chinina and were strafed by British fighters. One German plane caught fire and crashed, and the remaining planes were also severely damaged. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

Sydney: Greek workers, represented by the Minister of Labor, sent a telegram to Australia expressing their gratitude for the heroic achievements of the Australian army in Greece. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

### Southern Border of French Somaliland: Rumors of Tegore's Troops Concentrating

Vichy: According to a dispatch from the port of Djibouti in French East Africa, Tegore's troops, covered by British motorized units, have indeed concentrated near the southern border of French Somaliland, with their main force gathered near the town of Dao'an and the town of Chailah in British Somaliland, near the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway. These troops are preparing to contact the French border guards in Somaliland and are using an airplane to distribute leaflets, inciting French troops to defect to Dao'an and Chailah with their weapons. These leaflets are signed by General Le Gentilehomme, the former commander of the French forces in East Africa. The Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway, which is now a vital passage for preventing famine in Abyssinia and evacuating wounded and sick soldiers, is very important. France will naturally negotiate with the shipowners to prevent the war from spreading to this railway. However, the French Somaliland authorities will never contact the Tegore rebels. The French government has issued instructions to the governor of French Somaliland on this matter in order to act accordingly. (28th Havas News Agency Dispatch)

London: The Free French Headquarters in London stated that the Vichy government is spreading rumors that the Free French, with the help of the British army, are gathered near the border of French Somaliland. This kind of news should not be easily believed. However, this news clearly reports that there is a spontaneous movement among the French troops stationed in Djibouti, French Somaliland. It has long been known that the French troops and the people in that area support the Free French, and Djibouti was one of the first French territories to advocate continuing resistance after the Franco-German armistice. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

Vichy: The Vichy government announced yesterday that two columns of Free French troops had stormed into French Somaliland, which is loyal to Vichy. The government issued a communique here stating, "We will fight the Tegore troops who landed on the coast." It is believed that the Free French troops landed in Chailah, and another landed near Djibouti. Another Free French force is attacking along the Addis Ababa railway. The Free French troops were forced to retreat when they landed on the coast because they encountered superior French forces loyal to the Vichy government. However, it is believed that this preparation is more complete than the Dakar affair. Vichy government officials believe that the Free French invasion of Somaliland is the prelude to the struggle between Vichy and General Tegore for the African empire, but they firmly believe that the officials and people of the French colony will be loyal to Vichy, and the Free French movement will eventually fail. However, neutral observers believe that the outcome of the struggle between Vichy and the Free French movement in Africa largely depends on the fate of the Axis and British armies in battle. If the Axis powers attack the Suez Canal and fail, or even retreat, the Free French movement will immediately have the opportunity to attack the Vichy forces from within and without. But if the Suez Canal falls and the British Empire in Africa begins to collapse, the Free French movement in "Black Africa" will have no chance. (29th International News Agency Dispatch)

### Australia and New Zealand Determined to Back Britain; Inspired by British Prime Minister's Speech; Single-Minded Effort to Win Final Victory

Sydney: Australian Acting Prime Minister Fadden recently telegraphed British Prime Minister Churchill, stating, "Your work has the full support of Australia." Labor Party member Watkins said yesterday, "The Labor Party should attempt to govern or join a national government." Many Labor Party members hold this view. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

Sydney: Australian Prime Minister Fadden recently declared that the recently transmitted Australian news is mostly erroneous in its description of the attitude of the Australian government, parliament, and people. The government has obtained evidence of this kind of attempt and will take strong steps to deal with it. He also said that the War Cabinet has discussed this matter and ordered the leaders of the publicity and censorship agencies to intercept and break these rumors. (29th United Press Dispatch)

Wellington: British Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast speech has had an inspiring effect in New Zealand. Newspapers, the public, and politicians are all firmly supporting the Prime Minister's determination to achieve final victory. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

(29th Reuters Dispatch)

### War Spreads to the Near East; Britain Makes Necessary Preparations; Reinforces Iraq to Secure Communication Lines; Turkey's Future Attitude is Particularly Noteworthy

Vichy: Military observers here recently stated that British Prime Minister Churchill mentioned the possibility of military action occurring in the Near East during his broadcast speech yesterday. Judging from the fact that 10,000 British troops have landed in Iraq, it can be seen that the British General Staff believes that the current European war is likely to expand to the Near East, and therefore has made the necessary preparations. Up to now, the Tigris and Euphrates valleys in Iraq have been defended by British troops coming from the Persian Gulf. According to news from the Egyptian capital, as soon as the British army retreats from Egypt to India, it will be responsible for securing communication lines. At the same time, Britain is also deploying forces in the Near East and maintaining contact with Turkey in order to resist the threat posed by the German and Italian forces to the islands of the Aegean Sea. In addition, Syria is also related to the Near East issue. If foreign troops enter Syria in the future to seek refuge due to defeat, they will naturally be dealt with in accordance with international law, that is, disarming them and confining them, just as the French army retreated into Switzerland in June last year. However, whether the current European war can expand to the Near East depends entirely on Turkey's attitude, because Turkey is the hub of Asia and Europe and the bridge between the Balkan War and the Eastern War. Therefore, before the outbreak of war in the East, both sides will demand that the Turkish government clarify its position. Recently, Axis newspapers have criticized Soviet policy, and the Italian "Oggi" even condemned the Soviet Union for encouraging Turkey to reject the conditions that the Axis powers should have proposed. All these points are noteworthy. (28th Havas Dispatch)

New York: American military experts said last night that Germany's military victory in the Balkans has enabled the Axis powers to launch an invasion of the Near East oil fields, as the Near East oil fields are the world's main source of fuel. American experts believe that various military obstacles, such as Turkey's neutrality and the Soviet Union's ambiguous response, may in fact delay Germany's advance into the Near East, but they admit that Germany's position has been greatly enhanced by the Balkan war. It is pointed out that the output of the Near East oil fields in Iran, Iraq, and Soviet Arabia is approximately 300,000 barrels per day, but their reserves of 20,000,000,000 barrels are almost equal to those of the United States, the world's largest oil producer. (29th International Dispatch)

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that Iraq and Iran have close relations under the Sa'dabad Pact, so the arrival of British troops in Iraq has the effect of calming the hearts of the Iranian people. However, according to reliable news received in London, some Iranian newspapers have been paying close attention to the news of German gains in Greece and advances in Libya. The newspapers speculate a lot about German plans and pay close attention to Turkey's attitude. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

Vichy: Iraqi Foreign Minister Hissan da stated that the change of cabinet does not affect foreign policy. Iraq always maintains friendly relations with all countries and strives to avoid participating in the war. The agreement between Britain and Iraq must be strictly implemented. The passage of British troops is in accordance with the Anglo-Iraqi agreement. (29th Haitong Dispatch)
