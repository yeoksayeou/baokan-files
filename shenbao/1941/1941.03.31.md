### Great Victory of Chinese Troops on the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Border: Recovery of Liyang City and Zhangzhu Town; Sian, Lincheng Bridge, and Huaihua Kan Also Recaptured One After Another; Japanese Retreat to Changxing, Chinese Pursuit Forces Advance to Suburbs

Shangrao - The Japanese army's recent rampant harassment on the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border was met with fierce resistance from Chinese troops everywhere. They finally crushed the invading Japanese forces, achieving a great victory. The battle unfolded as follows: On the 20th, the Japanese army increased reinforcements from Hangzhou to Changxing by three to four thousand. Japanese reinforcements from Yixing exceeded five thousand. The Japanese from Shangxingbu also sent over four thousand troops from Tianwangsi, Lishui, and other places, totaling more than ten thousand troops. Starting from the 20th, they launched an offensive on Changxing in three routes. One route, on the 20th, advanced from Hongxi Bridge southwest of Changxing to attack Lincheng Bridge. On the afternoon of the 21st, they attacked Sian west of Lincheng Bridge. A bloody battle took place in the mountainous area east of Sian, with numerous Japanese soldiers killed. On the afternoon of the 22nd, Japanese reinforcements launched a fierce attack and captured Sian. After a pincer attack by the Chinese army, Sian was recovered on the 23rd. The remaining Japanese troops retreated northward to Huaihua Kan. Simultaneously, the Japanese army advancing south from Yixing captured Zhangzhu Town on the afternoon of the 21st and then divided into two groups to wreak havoc. On the 24th, the Chinese army bravely launched a fierce attack on the Japanese at Huaihua Kan. On the morning of the 25th, the Chinese army captured Huaihua Kan, and the remaining Japanese troops retreated to Hexi, where they were surrounded and severely annihilated by the Chinese army. At the same time, a unit of the Chinese army, maneuvering behind the Japanese, launched a fierce attack on Lincheng Bridge, capturing it on the 25th. The Japanese urgently retreated towards Changxing. After capturing Lincheng Bridge, the Chinese army took advantage of the momentum and advanced, reaching the outskirts of Changxing. The Japanese army advancing east from Shangxingbu on the 20th captured Liyang City on the 22nd and continued their southward advance. The Chinese army in Daibu launched a rear attack, capturing multiple strongholds such as Nanduzhen. On the 24th, the Japanese troops in Liyang advanced south to Tongguanli, converging with the Japanese advancing west from Zhangzhu Town to attack Shanya Bridge. The Chinese army inflicted heavy blows everywhere, causing numerous casualties along the way. The Chinese army southwest of Guanxing also launched a strong attack on Zhangzhu Town, killing many. The remaining Japanese troops who attacked Shanya Bridge, Tongguanli, and other places retreated to Zhangzhu and Liyang. Starting from the 25th, the Chinese army launched a full-scale counterattack, recovering Liyang City at 8:00 AM on the 25th and then capturing Zhangzhu Town. By this point, the invading Japanese army had completely collapsed, and the Chinese troops from all routes were pursuing them in victory. (Dispatch of the 29th)

Amidst the Great Victory in Northern Jiangxi: Death of a Japanese Division Commander

Chongqing According to Frontline Reports from Jiangxi, the Japanese army attacking northern Jiangxi has suffered heavy losses and retreated after two weeks of fierce fighting with the Chinese army. Chinese sources describe the situation in Jiangxi, stating that the Japanese army launched a three-pronged westward offensive on February 15th. One crossed the Jin River, probing Duchen (transliteration), while the other two departed from Fengxin and Nanrixing, probing Gaoan. After occupying Gaoan, the Japanese army advanced towards Shanggao, reaching the outskirts of Shanggao on March 22nd. The Chinese army then launched a counteroffensive. The battles in the mountains northeast of Shanggao were particularly intense from March 22nd to 28th, as the Japanese army, under the cover of aerial bombardment, fiercely attacked the Chinese positions on the 23rd. By the 28th, all the attacking Japanese forces had been repelled, and they began a general retreat eastward. On the afternoon of the 28th, 1,600 Chinese soldiers, braving heavy rain, charged with bayonets, fiercely attacking the Japanese headquarters at Dongguang Bridge east of Shanggao. The Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, retreated eastward. Of the main Japanese forces attacking Shanggao, 70% were either killed or wounded, with only over a thousand remaining, divided into two teams retreating eastward. The great battle in Jiangxi was divided into three areas: northeast of Shanggao, southwest of Gaoan, and on both banks of the Jin River.

Soviet Red Star Newspaper Publishes Article Examining the Sino-Japanese War Situation

Moscow - The Soviet Red Star newspaper recently published an article examining the Sino-Japanese War situation, stating that the Japanese army's attention this year seems to have shifted to the southern China theater. The recent Japanese landing in Guangdong is more important than previous landings, but the Chinese army has been able to put up strong resistance, preventing them from advancing north. The Chinese army's counteroffensive is proceeding smoothly. The newspaper further pointed out the Japanese army's defeats in central China, stating that the Japanese army's attempt to use surprise tactics to open up the Pinghan Railway has also failed.

Chongqing - According to the Ta Kung Pao, the Direct Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance is said to be gradually implementing strong measures to streamline the collection of various direct taxes to meet expected standards.

Everglades - President Roosevelt, in a nationwide radio broadcast from his yacht last night, denounced the Nazi and Communist parties and the tripartite alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, referring to them as enemies of the democratic system. "Their hawks and conspiracies are now doing their best to undermine America's confidence in its government." All American people must rise up together to defend the American way of life, but this requires sacrifice. People will work longer and the hardships of work will be greater than usual. "If our civilization is trampled, the peaceful way we seek cannot exist. Although this week is relatively quiet, there is a greater need for our courage, determination, and practical action. The threats of the Axis are directly aimed at America's various fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion. These permanent basic avenues are now threatened by dictatorships." "In view of the lessons of the countries that were reduced last year, the countries that have not yet perished in the world can understand what it is like to live under the Nazi secret police." Speaking of the Communist Party, he said that they harmed the workers in France before and during the war, leading to its destruction. (Dispatch of the 30th, Associated Press)

### Guo Taiqi's Speech in England

London - Chinese Ambassador to England Guo Taiqi, in a speech to the Chinese War Commission here, said that the Lend-Lease Act recently signed by President Roosevelt will have a decisive effect on the wars in Asia and Europe. President Roosevelt's recent broadcast speech mentioning China has given the Chinese government and people great spiritual satisfaction, which is no less important than the material assistance promised. We have been fighting hard in a state of near isolation for several years, and now we know that we are no longer isolated. China takes a calm approach to Matsuoka's trip to Berlin and is not alarmed at all. We believe that this move is both sufficient to show Japan's eagerness to consolidate the relationship between the three countries and to expose the weakness of the Axis forces in Asia. Japan's repeated peaceful offensives are also sufficient to show that Japan's war against China is increasingly failing. Furthermore, China has no intention of making a make-shift solution.

Editorial

### Japan in the Axis's Decline

In the past week, the changes in the international situation have been quite rapid and unpredictable. The evolution of the situation in the Balkans is like a dreamlike drama, and the Italian forces in East Africa and the Mediterranean have been severely damaged one after another, which also indicates the fate of Italy's possessions and its fleet. At the same time, there are various rumors, such as Romania's cession of land, Bulgaria's revolution, and even news of Italy's internal strife and the assassination of the Italian prime minister, interspersed among them. Although some of them are pure rumors and some remain to be confirmed, they also show the small degree of stability of the so-called "New European Order", which has caused various forms of fluctuations in people's minds. This spring season is the time when the Axis is preparing for a major offensive, but the adverse factors that have come from many sources have undoubtedly caused the Nazi leaders to face unprecedented difficulties. How to reverse the decline in the Balkans, how to resist the American aid to Britain and Greece, and how Yugoslavia dares to provoke the tiger in front of a strategically unfavorable position, there may be people in the vast European Nazi-controlled or occupied areas who are preparing to follow suit. Hitler, who used to be unstoppable and successful in everything, can hardly imagine what good strategies he will use to overcome this difficult situation. His impending attack on England, even if it does not stop as a result, cannot but be diverted some energy and troops, further reducing the chances of success. All of these things, happening neither sooner nor later, just when Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka visited and asked, caused him to be ridiculed as an "inauspicious bird". It is as if someone had arranged in advance to expose their own weaknesses when the Axis was putting on a showy feast for the VIP, so that they could no longer boast and flaunt in front of this VIP. This is a coincidence, but it also has its natural cause and effect.

Recently, the voices of the Japanese government and the public regarding the southward advance have become quieter. On the one hand, this is naturally the nearing of the action phase, and oral and written rhetoric can no longer exert greater power. On the other hand, it is waiting for the launch of the Axis offensive in Europe, so as to seize the most favorable moment. When the former Yugoslavia had just joined the Axis and the Germans boasted of victory, the Japanese public opinion issued praise, implicitly indicating that the move had brought Japan closer to the fulfillment of its illusions. But in the blink of an eye, the situation was completely different, which was probably not something that the so-called reformist politicians in Japan could have expected. The newspaper's editorial pointed out that if the Japanese Foreign Minister had visited Germany and Italy before September of last year, the international excitement it would have caused would have been several times higher than it is now. But if Matsuoka had started his journey half a month later this time, he might have delayed his journey again to observe the winds and determine his next move, when the Axis was in unprecedented distress. Now that Matsuoka's visit to Germany and Italy is about to be completed, everything he has witnessed and experienced will not only fail to strengthen his blind faith but will only reduce his original courage. Of course, what the Axis needs from Japan at this moment is both urgent and imperative, which is not difficult to see from the grand and enthusiastic welcome of Matsuoka in Berlin. If the Three-Power Alliance is a matter of morality, now is the time for Japan to stand up and rescue its allies from danger. But looking at Matsuoka's speeches, at best, they are still the familiar clichés, repeated again and again, and have not gained any new and more positive inspiration from this trip. Matsuoka is in Berlin, because the Nazi authorities are still in high spirits, and the wartime situation in Germany is not too bad, and his impression may still have some active elements in it. However, this time, going from Germany to Italy, meeting with that country and authority that has been defeated in three battles and lost three times, it is expected that he will hear many complaints and annoyance, and see wartime life and emotions that are far worse than those in his own country. I don't know what his feelings will be, and how to comfort the hopes of his allies in adversity. The defeat of Italy is pointing to the fate of a person who is ambitious but whose strength is not commensurate. The two serious injuries to its navy further illustrate that merely possessing powerful ships cannot guarantee the acquisition of maritime hegemony. Resources, morale, and experience, together with the righteousness of the war, are all factors that have a more decisive effect than the amount of tonnage. These real-world lessons, Matsuoka may not be completely unmoved by them?

In fact, the goal of Matsuoka's trip is still a matter of great controversy. In short, it is nothing more than trying to strengthen collusion with the Axis in order to obtain conditions that are beneficial to oneself. In other words, Japan naturally has its own basic foreign policy, which was decided long before Matsuoka proposed going to Europe, but the harsh objective conditions for realizing its basic policy need Matsuoka's trip to Europe to find possible cooperation from Germany and Italy to remedy its harsh conditions. But at this moment, it is precisely when the Axis is in unprecedented hardship, and the support it can provide to Japan is far less than the assistance it needs from Japan. Moreover, what the Nazis can support Japan is all in the future after the war is won, as can be seen from the meeting between Matsuoka and Funk. As for real assistance, even if the German side has this surplus, it must go through close cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union before Japan can receive its real benefits, which is not something that can be imagined at this moment. Therefore, even if Matsuoka himself does not suddenly change his confidence due to the recent events in Europe, he will have completely different feelings and thoughts on his way home than he did before visiting Europe. In Japan, support for the Three-Power Alliance has always been mixed. The recent succession of events has further proved that it is not easy to restore the Axis's prestige and achieve victory, and at present, it is only the beginning of its decline. In the democratic camp, however, the path of justice is aided by many, and it is making rapid progress on the path of extreme joy and prosperity. How this will affect Japan's future movements is a question that deserves great attention.

### British and Indian Army and Air Force Continue to Reinforce Singapore, U.S. Warships to Remain Stationed in the South Pacific, Japan Dares Not Repeat Italy's Mistake

Singapore – According to official announcements, British forces, the Royal Air Force, and the Indian Army continue to arrive with reinforcements. (Reuters, 30th)

Washington – The U.S. naval mission to New Zealand and Australia has concluded. The Navy Department declined to comment on the current location or future assignments of the ships. This has led to various speculations. Informed sources suggest that the authorities may order the ships to remain stationed in the South Pacific for an extended period, thereby exerting pressure on Japan. A total of sixteen warships visited New Zealand and Australia, marking the largest U.S. naval presence in the region in sixteen years. The Navy Department previously stated that the visit was a goodwill tour. However, the ships' stay was extended by a week, and the number of ports visited exceeded expectations. Some sources believe the U.S. aims to compel Japan to continue speculating on the increased U.S. attention to anti-Axis defenses in the South Pacific. Recently, Berlin reported that Germany advised Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka that Japan must decide whether to attack Singapore and actively engage in war against Britain, or prefer future isolation against Britain and America. Therefore, the strict secrecy surrounding the U.S. warships' movements is noteworthy. (29th dispatch)

Washington – Senator George, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated yesterday that Yugoslavia's resistance to Germany would make Japan even more reluctant to attack Singapore. He said, "Based on observations of events in the last thirty days, Japan will not repeat Italy's mistake of presuming that Germany's victory in the war is imminent." George has closely monitored events in the Balkans since Matsuoka's arrival in Berlin. He stated that Japan has apparently been repeatedly urged to attack Singapore. If they were to do so, they would have done it long ago, before British forces were strengthened there. George declined to comment on how the U.S. would react if Japan attacked Singapore. However, according to another official, the U.S. might provide Britain with "unprecedented" massive assistance. According to George, "Japan cannot disregard the Soviet Union. If Japan is induced to attack Singapore and cannot guarantee a quick end to military operations, the Soviet Union may intervene. Naturally, while Matsuoka is currently in Berlin, European events are insufficient to provide Japan with renewed assurances." (United Press, 30th)

### U.S. Newspapers Discuss Japan's Southern Advance

Washington Dispatch – One of the major newspapers here, the Washington Times-Herald, recently published an article discussing Japan's southward advance. The content is divided into arguments for and against. The pro-advance arguments are: (1) Britain is currently entangled in wars in Europe and Africa and cannot fully focus on defending the Far East, while the U.S. position in the Far East is growing stronger, making this the best time for Japan to advance south. (2) The gains from a southern advance are enormous. After occupying the Dutch East Indies, Japan would become the master of the Western Pacific. At the same time, raw materials such as rubber, oil, and tin would be readily available, and the Dutch East Indies would become an excellent market for Japanese goods. (3) Japan has made all necessary preparations for war. In fact, it is questionable whether Japan will ever be as strong as it is today. Japan's domestic production has reached its peak due to the China Incident, but this level of production is unlikely to be sustainable. Without initiating new events, Japan's production enterprises will be unable to continue. (4) The Soviet Union's current attitude towards Japan is friendly. Commercial negotiations between the two countries are ongoing. With no worries about the Soviet Union, now is the best opportunity for Japan to advance south. The anti-advance arguments are: (1) Major Japanese cities are constructed of wood and paper. Once war breaks out, a few aircraft carrying incendiary bombs could set the cities ablaze. Major cities are within range of Soviet and American air forces, making a Japanese advance unwise. (2) Japan's trade routes are easily cut off. Britain can cut off Japan's raw material transport routes in Europe and Africa, and the U.S. can use Honolulu as a base to cut off Japan's routes to North and South America. (3) Japan cannot use surprise attack strategies. Japan has made necessary preparations in Vietnam, making it difficult for Japan to achieve its goals. (4) If Japan advances south, its forces will be greatly divided. If Japan begins large-scale warfare against Britain, China will seize the opportunity to counterattack. At the same time, the U.S., given Japan's ambition towards the Philippines, may also be drawn into the war. Therefore, Japan should not advance south at this time.

Because of the changes in Yugoslavia, the Danube's position is tantamount to falling into enemy hands. (Editor's note: The Danube is the lifeblood of Central Europe, with 200 miles flowing through Yugoslav territory). Germany's cargo shipments from Southeastern Europe, such as Romanian oil and Balkan grains, and the military materials that Germany supplies to Romania and Bulgaria will be greatly affected because Yugoslavia controls a section of the Danube. Experts agree that even if Germany can defeat Yugoslavia within a month, it will be where "the hills and rivers of Yugoslavia will be piled high with the bones of Prussian generals." Germany, considering the attitudes of Turkey and Yugoslavia, will likely delay attacking Greece. Both Germany and Italy are well aware that if Yugoslavia participates in the war, the Italian forces in Albania will immediately be driven into the sea. However, Germany should also note that Yugoslavia's involvement in the war would allow Britain to obtain air and naval bases in the Adriatic Sea. (Editor's note: The shortest distance from northern Yugoslavia to Vienna is only 100 miles). (United Press, 30th)

### Yugoslav Authorities Urge People to Remain Calm, Rumors and Slander Will Be Crushed

Yugoslav Capital – The police department here issued a notice yesterday, asking the public not to engage in demonstrations against warring nations. It stated that those who express hostility towards warring nations through excessive behavior in recent demonstrations will be dealt with according to the law. Officials in Berlin are concerned about the growing strength of anti-German forces in Yugoslavia. Propaganda Minister Goebbels is promoting the issue to create discord within Yugoslavia. The German side is spreading news of discontent among the people of Croatia, and Radio Rome is broadcasting that armed soldiers are among the crowds destroying German and Italian shops in the Yugoslav capital. Therefore, Radio Belgrade warned foreign journalists not to spread false information that could harm Yugoslavia's relations with neighboring countries, lest it be used by foreign radio stations. (Reuters, 30th)

Yugoslav Capital – It is rumored in Budapest that the Yugoslav government has issued a general mobilization order and declared martial law.

Only telephone traffic has been interrupted, and all taverns have been ordered to close by midnight. There has been no consideration of martial law or mobilization. However, for national security, the movement of troops is a reality. Regarding this matter, foreign radio stations have issued various rumors. The official radio station here issued a statement to set the record straight. It stated, "Some foreign radio stations are engaged in alarmist statements, and even maliciously spreading various messages, either baseless or intended to damage our country's relations with neighboring countries. We are now authorized by the government to deny this. The position adopted by our country has been clarified in a statement issued by Prime Minister General Simović. In the future, measures will be taken to punish those who spread rumors. However, most of these people are foreigners who fail to understand our country's generosity towards them. If they do not change their ways, they will be deported once identified." (Havas, 3rd)

### Of Italy's Giant Battleships, Only One Remains After Sea Battle in Eastern Mediterranean, British Fleet Shows Might

London – The British fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean, led by General Cunningham, clashed with the Italian fleet yesterday. While the fierce battle was underway, General Cunningham reported the situation to the Admiralty. According to the Admiralty's communiqué, after the British fleet encountered the Italian fleet, composed of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, the enemy fleet immediately dispersed. Several ships engaged with the central ships. At the same time, British naval aircraft, the British Air Force, and Greek warships also participated in the battle. At least three Italian ships, one a 35,000-ton battleship and two cruisers, were damaged. The rest scattered. Further details are awaited. The damaged Italian battleship was of the "Littorio" class. Italy has three battleships of this class. One of them was destroyed by British aircraft in Taranto harbor last November. The two Italian cruisers damaged yesterday were both heavily damaged. The communiqué did not mention the fate of the Italian destroyers, but when Naval Minister Alexander spoke about the battle yesterday afternoon, he said that he thought few Italian destroyers escaped. British aircraft saw rafts crowded with people on the sea, indicating that at least one Italian ship must have been sunk. It is reported that the Italian fleet has always been deeply hidden in southern Italy or the Sardinian Sea. Today was the first time they set out as a group, and they were forced to engage when spotted by the British fleet.

### Italian Sailors Attempt Sabotage, U.S. Coast Guard Deploys Troops to Guard Seized Italian Ships

Washington – Italian ships in U.S. ports were suddenly guarded by U.S. Coast Guard troops this morning. The Coast Guard had previously received intelligence that the sailors on seventeen Italian ships in the U.S. and one Italian ship in the Panama Canal Zone had determined to destroy the ships' engines. It is reported that the Italian ships in the U.S. are currently berthed in fourteen locations including Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. They are all cargo ships, mostly of the 6,000-ton class. The Coast Guard relayed information that the sailors on the 23,000-ton Italian mail ship Conte Biancamano, berthed in the Panama Canal Zone, were already destroying the ship. After receiving the report, the Coast Guard relayed it to the Department of the Army, because the Canal Zone is under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army. Department of the Army personnel did not comment yesterday. The Coast Guard said that the initial news of Italian sailors destroying ships came simultaneously from Baltimore, Maryland, and the Canal Zone, so they immediately sent troops to board the ships and monitor them. A Coast Guard spokesman said, "This action is based on the Espionage Act and should not be considered seizure. The ships' officers and sailors have not been detained. The Coast Guard is only deploying troops to prevent further destruction. After the ships are damaged, it hinders navigation. All countries can do the same in this situation." The motive of the Italian sailors is still unclear today. (International News Service, 30th)

New York – This morning, the Coast Guard boarded five Italian cargo ships in New York Harbor and found that important parts of the ships had been damaged. These ships are the Brillarello, San Lionardo, Alberto, Ossa Asa. Most of these ships have been detained here since Italy entered the war. The engines of each ship had been damaged, and flammable materials had been piled up in the cargo holds in preparation for arson. Fully armed soldiers are now stationed at the ships' berths, while other soldiers are conducting thorough inspections. The sailors on each ship looked somber but did not resist the search. (International News Service, 30th)

### Rapid Progress of British Forces in East Africa, Occupation of Dire Dawa, Highway to Abyssinian Capital Cut Off, Asmara About to Fall

London – According to sources here, the capture of Dire Dawa has given British forces control of the railway line from the Abyssinian capital to the French Somaliland port of Djibouti. The railway's main material and repair factories are in Dire Dawa, which has been repeatedly bombed by British aircraft before falling. Harar, the second largest city in Abyssinia, which was captured by British forces on Thursday, is also connected by a 25-mile branch line. (Reuters, 30th)

Rome – An Italian General Headquarters communiqué announced today that Dire Dawa, an important town on the railway line from Addis Ababa to Djibouti, has now been abandoned. Italian troops have moved to a new position west of the town, maintaining good order. (Reuters, 30th)

Cairo – It is reported that British forces are currently pursuing the retreating Italian army from Keren. This morning, they were less than forty miles from Asmara. British infantry and artillery are advancing on Asmara. It is predicted that the city may be captured within a few days. It is reported that Italian survivors are fleeing blindly, abandoning their equipment and mules, and fleeing on foot into the mountains. According to unofficial estimates, 10,000 Italian soldiers were killed or wounded in the Battle of Keren. Italian troops retreating from Keren and Harar were heavily bombed by the British Air Force. Artillery positions outside of Al-Kahmara were also destroyed by British bombs. (International News Service, 30th)

### The Morale of the Righteous Army Declines; The Fate of East Africa is Decided

London, Reuters Military Commentator states that the British army's victory at Keren, while not yet fully recovering Abyssinia or conquering Eritrea, has certainly opened wider the door to final victory. The British army is apparently hampered by its small numbers and lack of transport, preventing it from outflanking the Italian army's positions. However, according to news from the front lines, the Italian army's already revitalized morale has now declined. This decisive collapse will not only affect morale, but also throw command into a panic. Without a plan to fight a rearguard action, the British army is now advancing with vigor. The British army's capture of Asmara is highly likely within days. Once that city falls, Massawa will be within reach. At the same time, the British army's capture of Harar on the opposite front is a decisive and important step towards the complete recovery of Abyssinia. The Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway is now in immediate danger. The British army may have already crossed it, or may do so soon. With the Italian army unable to stop the British advance on Harar, its strength to resist the other two British forces advancing north from Kenya will be even weaker. In addition, there are three more routes proceeding smoothly towards Aksum, so Aksum will soon be cut off from other areas and fall into isolation. Once Aksum falls, Italian control of East Africa will completely collapse. Then the British army and air force can divert a large number of troops north to solidify the new British front line. Therefore, this move is of utmost importance. It is now hoped that a resolute stance from Southern countries can give the Greek army and the British air force the idea to promptly destroy the Italian forces in northern Albania, before German forces can come to their aid. Even if they cannot immediately expel all the Italian forces from the entire territory, it is sufficient to occupy the important ports of Vlorë and Durazzo. This is not only of great military importance in the present, but also can be used as a base for future attacks against that dictatorship. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)

### South African Air Force Active; Heavy Attacks on Italian Transportation Lines

Another train had a fire start nearby from a bomb landing close, and the Mieso train station was also bombed with a large fire spreading to other buildings. A large warehouse and the El Bahri train station were also hit by bombs. Italian motor transport convoys were also heavily bombed. Furthermore, on Friday, the British Air Force continued operations south of Keren, bombing and strafing enemy forces and motor transports on the road to Asmara. At least fifty enemy vehicles were heavily damaged, and enemy soldiers also suffered many casualties and deaths. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)

### Changes to the Board of Directors; Number of Seats to be Decided by the Consular Body. Potential for US and Japanese Representation to Each Increase by One Seat; Decision for Five Chinese Directors to Remain in Office Already Made

Today is the last day to determine the candidates for the next term of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors, as the list of candidates is due to be submitted to the General Office of the Municipal Council by 12:00 noon tomorrow. Yesterday, being Sunday, the negotiations between the British, American, and Japanese sides did not take place. However, some understanding has been reached between the ratepayers of the three countries, and this understanding may be finalized by the Consular Body today or tomorrow. Although the content of the negotiations has been refused to be disclosed by the officials of each country and the Municipal Council, there is little doubt that the number of members of the Board of Directors will change. Yesterday, this reporter visited the American ratepayers' representatives to inquire about this matter, and was told, "Please be patient, you will know the outcome tomorrow."

Rumors Vary Regarding Increase in Board Seats

Regarding the method for changing the number of Board of Directors seats, outside speculation varies. Some say that the British, American, Chinese, and Japanese directors will each have four seats, with the addition of one German and one from a neutral nationality. Others say that the British and Chinese directors will remain the same, with the American and Japanese directors each increasing by one seat. The latter possibility is more likely, as the current five British directors are expected to be re-elected, and the Chinese directors are still expected to be Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Chen Tingrui, Guo Shun, and Xi Yushu, so the only possible change would be in the American and Japanese directors. The American Chamber of Commerce has already nominated A.O. Fuller and Minsde, and will nominate one more person. The Japanese side will have current directors Okamoto and Takaoka re-elected, and the Residents' Association will nominate one more person. Watanabe, Chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association, is expected to be elected.

Final Decision to be Made by the Consular Body

The "North China Daily News" stated that concerning the determination of the seats on the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors, various speculations abound. However, after the nomination period for the Board of Directors ends at noon on Tuesday, all speculations should come to an end. The British community has already nominated at least four, if not five, British directors. The American directors have already been nominated as A.O. Fuller and Minsde. It is heard that various proposals regarding the future Board of Directors seats have been discussed. The final decision will be made by the Consular Body, and the Consular Body is expected to make a final decision soon. However, before this decision is announced, the number of directors from each community is subject to much speculation, as the Municipal Council will not announce the names of the new directors until the nomination period has ended.

Motions Must be Notified by Deadline

The Ratepayers' Annual Meeting has been scheduled for April 17th, and the motions have already been announced by the Municipal Council. Yesterday, according to a public announcement by the Municipal Council: (1) Ratepayers who intend to add or amend motions six and seven may, in accordance with the Ratepayers' Annual Meeting Rules, notify the General Office of the Municipal Council before 5:00 PM on April 9th for publication. (2) Ratepayers who have any questions regarding the accounts or budget, as well as other motions related to the Annual Meeting, must submit their opinions in writing to the General Office of the Municipal Council at least twenty-four hours before the Annual Meeting in order to receive a response.

Election Rules Revised and Published

Once the issue of the Board of Directors has been resolved by the three Consuls and community representatives, the election will be a mere formality, with the date likely to be April 10th and 11th. The polling places will be none other than the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Parade Ground on Foochow Road. As for the election rules, they have been approved by the Municipal Council Board of Directors and will be re-revised. The original rules formulated by the Municipal Council on March 17, 1938, shall be repealed immediately. The new rules are divided into three chapters. The first chapter concerns the appointment of staff, with a total of two articles. The second chapter concerns the rules for conducting the election, with a total of eighteen articles, all of which are detailed procedures for ratepayers to vote and elect. The third chapter concerns the duties of inspectors and the rules for counting votes, with a total of fourteen articles. The full text of the election rules has been published in the Municipal Council Gazette so that all ratepayers are fully informed.

The Chinese Side Remains Silent

Since the British and Japanese Residents' Associations negotiated in January, leading to the Consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan discussing the distribution of seats on the Board of Directors, the Chinese side has always maintained a silent attitude, refusing to make any relevant criticisms. Yesterday, this reporter inquired with a relevant party, who stated that they are currently unwilling to comment on the increase or decrease in the number of Board of Directors members, the simultaneous convening of the Ratepayers' Annual Meeting and special meetings, and various tax system matters, and will wait for the situation to develop before deciding on an attitude. Before everything comes to light, silence is the best policy. Yesterday, the British, American, and Japanese ratepayers also maintained their usual silence. This reporter met with Mr. Minsde yesterday and attempted to gauge his attitude on this matter. Mr. Minsde smiled without answering.

The Four Banks Raise Savings Deposit Rates

Current account deposits earn 5% interest; deposits not withdrawn earn an additional 2%; fixed-term deposits earn 8% for six months, and 10% for five years.

Following the Ministry of Finance's raising of savings deposit rates, the "New Voice" reporter inquired with the four major banks—Bank of China, Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China—yesterday, and learned that the Chungking headquarters of the Four Banks and their branches in the Free Areas (excluding the Shanghai Concession areas) have revised their savings deposit interest rates as follows: (1) Current account savings deposits earn 5% interest; deposits not withdrawn earn an additional 2%, totaling 7%. (2) Fixed-term savings deposits earn an annual interest rate of 8% for six months, 8.5% for one year, 9% for two years, 9.5% for three and four years, and 10% for five years. Deposits for more than five years will continue to earn 10% interest, with a maximum term of ten years. To give preferential treatment to depositors, all current account savings deposits from January 1, 1941, will be calculated at the new interest rate.

### Shanghai's Wealthy Families Donate Money; A Single Donation of 200,000 Yuan Sets a New Record for Individual Donations in Shanghai

Chungking, 30th—Since the fundraising campaign began in Shanghai, the results have been remarkable. The National Comfort Corps previously felt some concerns about the Shanghai wealthy merchants and dignitaries being hesitant to donate generously due to the special environment. Recently, they have been deeply gratified by the continuous stream of donations from Shanghai. It was learned yesterday that Chengxintang, a large household in Shanghai, has donated a huge sum of 200,000 yuan, which has been wired to Chongqing. This enthusiastic and righteous act is truly admirable. In the past half month, the General Assembly has received more than 600,000 yuan in donations from Shanghai. This amount has become the highest record for individual donations in Shanghai. However, inspired by patriotic enthusiasm, all circles in Shanghai will certainly follow suit one after another, and it will not be difficult to exceed this record in the near future.

Patrol teams of five people each patrolled back and forth everywhere within the Concessions, extremely busy. Armored vehicles were also deployed to patrol, to enhance the police force everywhere. The order throughout the day was very good.

Increased Police Patrols Along Border Regions

Yesterday, the British and American troops of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were dispatched to defend District B as usual, but the number of people was greatly increased. In addition to leaving two people stationed at each important passage, three-person teams patrolled each area. The remaining teams, such as the Chinese troops, traveled within the Concessions by car. Yesterday, the American and Italian troops were deployed in their respective defense zones, and the French army and navy were also fully mobilized and cooperated with the police patrols, so the precautions taken in the French Concession were unprecedentedly strict. Yesterday, police forces were increased and barbed wire was added at the entrances and exits of the borders of the two Concessions. The entrances to the Shanghai Southwest City were searched with strictness for pedestrians. The New Zha Bridge, Jiangxi Road Bridge, and Pentanglong Bridge on Suzhou Creek were all sealed off. For the remaining bridges, multiple police officers were stationed separately to maintain strict vigilance.

All Entertainment Venues Closed Down

Public entertainment venues within the two concessions, such as the Great World, Yong'an Tianyunlou, Sincere Amusement Park, New World Amusement Park, and Great New World Amusement Park, all announced their closure for one day to prevent undesirable elements from easily sneaking in and causing trouble.

In an instant, black smoke filled the air and the flames soared into the sky. When the Shanghai Fire Brigade of the Shanghai Municipal Council received the news, they rushed three pump trucks to the scene, but the fire was already raging and had burned through the roof. After the firefighters worked hard to extinguish the fire, it was finally put out after about two hours. As a result, the building was completely burned down.

### Tailors Strike; Tailoring Industry Closed Down Yesterday; Workers Request New Wage Negotiations Due to Soaring Rice Prices; Political Department of Shanghai Municipal Council Has Tried To Mediate

The tailoring industry is located in the area around Hubei Road, Szechuan Road, and Avenue Joffre. Due to the soaring rice prices and the difficulties in life, all the workers followed the labor-capital contract and requested the employers to renegotiate wages. After unsuccessful mediation by the Political Department of the Public Settlement Warehouse, they went on strike unanimously the day before yesterday. All the tailoring shops, due to the workers' strike, announced that "Workmen have gone on strike and been forced to close the market." The workers have issued an official statement, appealing to all walks of life for assistance. The details are recorded as follows:

Workers Request New Wage Negotiations

In the December 17th, 1910 labor capital pact between all tailor companies, wages had been agreed by the Political Department of the Public Settlement Warehouse. Section 7 of the agreement stated "the duration of this contract is one year, but if commodity prices plummet, or if rice prices, with No. 2 Xian rice as the standard, exceed 100 yuan per stone, then wages will be renegotiated. Now, workers, in view of the fact that rice prices have exceeded 100 yuan, are compelled to ask the capital side to renegotiate wages, according to the contract." Immediately, the Political Department of the Public Settlement Warehouse sought to mediate. As the capital side did not allow any party to be present, workers' requests were denied, and negotiations could not take place. The spirit of the entire work force was extremely high, and almost went on strike. Fortunately, they were persuaded by the Political Department to allow mediation and await just laws and resolutions.

After the Strike, Closing Down Was Announced

The conditions put forward by the workers are based on the price of No. 2 Xian rice at 60 yuan per stone at the time of the contract, while the current price of No. 2 Xian rice is 110 yuan per stone. Based on this calculation, wages should be increased by 60% to comply with the spirit of the contract. The capital side did not agree to increase wages by 60%, but agreed to increase wages appropriately, so that the labor and capital sides each maintained their reasons and refused to yield to each other. Until the second negotiation on the 28th of this month, there were no results, which led to a breakdown. All workers went on strike on the day before yesterday. It is heard that after the workers' strike, the capital side announced the closure of the market, and convened a joint meeting of three roads, appointing representatives to be responsible for handling the matter, and decided that the market shall not be opened for business until a compromise is reached, and the workers' meals shall be stopped.

Political Department Has Tried To Mediate

The Political Department of the Public Settlement Warehouse has made a second effort to mediate the strike in the tailoring industry, in order to resolve the strike as soon as possible, and hopes that the labor and capital sides will each make concessions. The capital side regretted their refusal to attend the mediation at 10 AM on the 29th of this month. Workers' representatives gathered at the Political Department, quietly waiting for good news. As capital side representatives would not attend, no talks could be made. On the same day, capital side representatives held a summit of the three roads and resolved that the shops must adhere to the end, and cannot compromise privately. All package meals to work sites are to be cut off, those who violate this will be fined 1000 National currency dollars. If any of the shops on the three roads suffer damage, the expenses will be borne jointly by all the shops. If a representative of the store unfortunately encounters misfortune, the sum of 10,000 National currency dollars will be paid for bereavement. The three road shops have been closed since 8 PM on March 29th, and must await the resolution of the labor dispute before being able to resume operations.

### Bloodshed Occurs on Avenue Joffre Yesterday; Sheng Zhiren Is Assassinated; Suffers Two Gunshot Wounds; Life Is In Great Danger; The Gunman Appears to Have Been Well-Acquainted With Sheng

Yesterday, the two Concessions were under strict police alert. However, in the midst of this major alert, it was generally believed that there would be quiet and tranquility. Unexpectedly, an assassination occurred in the French Concession. The protagonist of the bloodshed was Sheng Zhiren of Jingjiang, the "Chairman of the Shanghai West District Businessmen's Association." The details of the incident are recorded below.

Served as a Committee Member for Road Trade Associations

Sheng Zhiren, a native of Jingjiang, is 60 years old and resides at No. 8 Dingji Lane, 116 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Sheng formerly served as a committee member of the French Concession Road Business Association, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, and the Fourth District Branch of the Citizens' Association. After the Shanghai War, Sheng was unemployed for a time and is said to be the current "Chairman of the Shanghai West District Businessmen's Association." However, Sheng is fond of women and has three concubines.

A Man Arrives Suddenly and Fires Two Shots

Yesterday afternoon at 3:45 PM, a man named Jia, wearing a yellow robe, a black felt hat, and black-rimmed glasses, in his thirties, who appeared to be acquainted with Sheng, barged into the eastern wing of Sheng's residence. After exchanging pleasantries with Sheng, Sheng suddenly felt hot and took off his woolen waistcoat. Unexpectedly, Jia pulled out a pistol from his sleeve and fired two shots at his chest. Both shots hit, and Sheng collapsed on the spot. The assassin, with his purpose achieved, fled with the weapon.

Wounds in Vital Areas; Life Is In Great Danger

After the incident, the Sungshan Road police station received a report and quickly dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the scene, searching in all directions. However, the assassin had already disappeared. The injured person was then rushed by car to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Because Sheng was wounded in vital areas and was old, his life was in great danger. The police are now investigating the cause of the case to determine whether it was due to political reasons or a vendetta.

### The Third Anniversary of the Great Victory of Taierzhuang Was Yesterday

Yesterday was the third anniversary of the unprecedented great victory of Taierzhuang. People from all walks of life in this city, due to the special environment, did not hold a grand commemorative ceremony, but instead commemorated the meaning of the great victory in an atmosphere of solemnity, perseverance, and fortitude. On the one hand, they emulated the will of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country and completed the great task of resistance and reconstruction. On the other hand, in order to express their loyalty to the party and the country, they continued to promote frugal donations, vowed allegiance, strengthened their confidence, and were not shaken by any environment.

Boston Radio Station of the United States Broadcasts to Shanghai

Daily broadcasts with regulation are made and listening hours are at 10 AM

The latest shortwave radio station, WRUL, Boston, USA, has now decided to make special daily broadcasts to the Far East. Shanghai and other places can listen in. This news was announced by Ms. Smith of the China Trade Registration Office of the US Consulate. The broadcast time is said to be 8am-8:30am Far East Standard Time, Shanghai Daylight Savings Time 10am-10:30am. The frequency of the Boston Radio Station, the shortwave wavelength, is 11.79 and 15.35 meters. The station to broadcast to Shanghai a year ago was the shortwave radio station, Pearl Island of the United States.

### Departing Coal Freighter: Citywide Coal Ball Production Fully Resumes

Recently, due to the tense situation in the Far East, speculators, using the excuse of reduced coal shipments, and hoarders manipulating existing supplies, coal prices have repeatedly soared. Besides under-the-table transactions, the coal market is in a state of having prices but no sales. However, the city's coal reserves are still around 400,000 tons, while monthly sales are only about 170,000 tons. Logically, there should be no cause for panic in the short term. But after speculators spread rumors and fueled the flames, the current tense situation was created.

Special Freighter Sails

It is learned that the authorities of the two concessions and relevant parties are currently planning sound measures to find dedicated coal freighters in this port to alleviate the city's coal shortage. Yesterday, reporters learned that a Norwegian merchant ship, "Liang He Xing" (transliteration), has been chartered specifically for transporting coal. The ship has a deadweight of 5,000 tons, and to avoid delays, it sailed from Shanghai without any cargo. The ship set sail yesterday morning, heading directly to Hong Gai, Vietnam. It is also learned that several other ships are being negotiated after this one, and once agreed upon, they will also be dedicated to transporting coal.

Suspension of Warehouse Receipts

Major coal dealers in the city have announced to holders of warehouse receipts that they must clear them within a limited time. Several coal dealers have also suspended issuing new warehouse receipts starting in March. Although this move may strike a blow to speculators, holders of warehouse receipts are delaying the date of delivery, preventing the increase of spot goods in the market. Furthermore, the suspension of issuing warehouse receipts in January may be used by opportunistic elements as an excuse to raise prices. Therefore, it is hoped that relevant parties will consider this point and seek improvement measures.

Workers Resume Work

After labor and management reached a resolution through direct negotiations the night before regarding the strike at the city's mechanized coal ball factories, workers at over ten factories including Yi Tai Xing, Nanyang, Dongfang, and Huatong resumed work across the board yesterday morning. Coal shops throughout the city also resumed business yesterday due to the resolution of the labor dispute at the coal ball factories.

Negotiating Price Reduction

Recently, the price of machine-made coal balls has been raised crazily, reaching over twelve yuan per load, leaving residents in this port with no breathing room. The increase in shipping costs is a recent event. After the rise in water transport costs, no overseas orders have been placed. The coal currently sold on the market is all that was imported and stockpiled when water transport costs were low. Therefore, this kind of excuse is ignorant and laughable, serving the same purpose as the warehouse receipt smokescreen. It is also learned that coal ball merchants are aware that this price increase has angered residents throughout the city and are negotiating a price reduction to appease public anger.

### U.S.-Japan Relations Not Optimistic: Crisis Lurks, U.S. Policy Strong, Supported by People; U.S. Will Step in to Help if Japan Advances Southward

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* reports from Chicago that the recent crisis in the Far East and its aftermath have clarified the situation in the Far East in the minds of the general public in the United States. Now that the crisis has passed, people are generally relieved, but during the tense situation, people here expressed a firm belief that the United States must adopt a tough policy in the Far East. To this day, this belief is growing stronger.

The U.S. Will Take Action in the Far East

Chicago is located in the central United States, and its people have traditionally held isolationist sentiments, mainly because it is furthest from the European and Far Eastern battlefields. However, with the unrest in the Pacific brewing into a crisis, public opinion here has gradually taken the attitude that the United States must take action in the Far East. The Axis powers' hope that the United States would be deterred by the difficulty of fighting on both oceans must have been shattered.

Firm Policy Receives Widespread Support

Generally speaking, in the central United States, it takes a long time to reach a decision on an opinion, but once a decision is made, it is unshakable. And the Axis diplomats must not be fools and must be aware of the situation here. In the past, the American people did not seem to pay much attention to developments in the Far East, but recently they have become increasingly concerned. The increased understanding between the United States and Australia reflects the firm policy that the U.S. government is now adopting in the East, and there is no doubt that the public widely supports this policy.

Will Not Stand Idly By if Japan Advances Southward

Mr. Pinte, a former Far East correspondent for the conservative *Chicago Daily Tribune*, wrote that when he traveled to Australia in mid-month, he did not hear any news that would lead him to believe that the United States had signed an agreement with Australia to defend the southwestern Pacific. However, Pinte also said, "If Japan were to attack the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, or any part of Australia, the United States may well help the Dutch East Indies and other places defend themselves for its own interests. The United States has received notifications regarding the convenience of ports and bases available in that part of the Pacific, just as the United States has received notifications regarding the convenience of the North Pacific. I believe the United States will be able to use the convenience of any port and base in Australia." These words come from a reliable newspaper such as the *Chicago Daily Tribune*'s foreign news editor and can be trusted.

Strengthen Defenses of U.S.-Held Islands

It is worth mentioning that the U.S. Navy has stationed naval observers in both Australia and New Zealand. Although Australia seems to be accommodating to maintain friendly relations with Japan, New Zealand has remained silent and calm in its approach to Japan. Cities across the United States, even those with a strong isolationist stance like Chicago, are demanding that the authorities make greater preparations in the Far East, strengthen military power in the Philippines, and implement the government's program to strengthen Samoa, Guam, and other U.S.-held islands in the Pacific more quickly. This matter must also be of great interest to people in Shanghai.

Anticipating Another Crisis in April

The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Nomura, is quite optimistic about U.S.-Japan relations. Everyone hopes that he has grounds for his optimism. However, the U.S. State Department in Washington, while not despairing, is not optimistic. This statement can summarize everything, that is, the United States very much wants to be optimistic and hopeful, but it has made a careful decision. It is expected that if the U.S. and Japan do not take decisive action to avoid the breakdown of peace in the Pacific in the spring, there may be another crisis in the Pacific in late April.

### Robbery on Guangxi Road: Stray Bullet Injures Person

A robbery occurred at 80 Lane, Guangxi Road, i.e., inside Jingqin Fang Lane, at 11 PM last night. After the victim shouted for help, the robbers fled together, rushing towards Beihai Road. Nearby police officers, having heard the alarm, gathered and gave chase. When the robbers reached the entrance of Gezhi Public School, the police opened fire. The robbers also returned fire, resisting arrest. Both sides exchanged fire four or five times. As a result, a secondhand goods dealer named Wang Jiulin, 43 years old, from Jiangbei, living at 69 Beihai Road, was shot in the buttocks and collapsed. The robbers escaped without a trace. The injured man was transported by ambulance to Renji Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the wound was not fatal, and his life is not in danger.

### British and American Chambers of Commerce Eagerly Hope for Return to Normalcy, Express Regret Over Terrorist Activities

The *Shanghai Times* reports that at a recent meeting, the British and American Chambers of Commerce in this city passed a resolution expressing regret over the recent terrorist activities in the city and hoping that such activities can be stopped immediately so that society can return to normal life and commerce can thus be stabilized. Wang Fuyou (60 years old) from Shaoxing, who made a living as a boatman, loaded firewood and charcoal from his hometown to Shanghai on the 27th of this month with his sons Jinquan and Sanbao. When approaching the North Fujian Road pier, he accidentally

Damaged a Bamboo Pole

on a cotton boat moored at the pier. The boatman, Yang Apan from Wuxi, argued with Wang Fuyou. As a result, Shen Yougui, a foreman from Jiangbei at the pier, intervened, leading to a quarrel and then a fight. More than ten hooligans who helped Foreman Shen held firewood and beat Wang Fuyou to the ground, injuring a vital part of his body. When those people saw that they had caused a major disaster, they fled in different directions. Later, Wang Jinrong, the victim's brother, arrived after hearing the alarm and handed Shen and Yang over to the guard, who took them to the police station. At the same time, the injured Wang Fuyou was hired a car to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he

Died En Route

The body was taken to the Jiaozhou Road morgue. Yesterday, the police sent the two suspects, Shen Yougui and Yang Apan, to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian described the case and requested a postponement of the examination of Shen's body. Then, the deceased's brother, Wang Jinrong, and son, Wang Sanbao, testified about what happened and questioned the two defendants, whose statements were evasive and pleaded for leniency. Judge Huang Risheng ordered them to remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing after Shen's body was examined.

### Undercover Detective Captures Extortionist

Yang Genrong, a local resident living in a bungalow without a number on Bailinan Road, 21 years old, used the name "Chinese Iron Blood Squad" on the 13th of this month to write a letter to He Taiyong Rice Store at 520 Hede Road, extorting 50,000 national currency from the store owner, Gan Xijia from Wuxi. Gan ignored the letter. At 9 AM on the 18th, Yang called Gan Xijia and told him to meet him at the entrance of Yuguang Village in Yuyuan Road, or else "be careful of getting shot." Gan was frightened and reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station under its jurisdiction. The police then ordered Chinese detective Zhao Yongji to disguise himself as a fruit vendor and wait at the entrance of Yuguang Village. Gan Xijia also arrived later. When Yang saw Gan, he stepped forward and abducted Gan. Detective Zhao immediately abandoned his fruit stand, caught up, arrested the robber Yang, and handed him over to the First Special District Court to apply for detention in accordance with the law. Yesterday, he was sent to the court's Third Criminal Division. The police prosecuted him for attempted extortion. Judge Huang presided over the trial. The defendant admitted that he had no means of making a living due to unemployment and wrote the threatening letter and begged for leniency in accordance with the law. The court, based on the circumstances of the case, concluded the trial and sentenced Yang Genrong to six months in prison for attempted extortion, and the threatening letter was confiscated.

### Du Hongbin's Body Collected by His Teacher

Du Hongbin, a young Shenqu artist, 25 years old, fell in love with a female performer, Wang Yanqin, but learned that Wang's love was not exclusive and that she liked the new and tired of the old. This caused Du to lose love and harbor resentment. On the evening of the 13th, he lured Wang to the Great World and killed her with a knife, shocking Shanghai. Afterwards, Du fled east and west, and knowing that he could not escape the law, he had the idea of committing suicide out of fear of punishment. On the afternoon of the 27th, he committed suicide by taking poison at the Ronghua Hotel. The waiter discovered this and sent him to the hospital, but he died. The body was sent back to the Renfu Wufen Hall morgue to await examination. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that Du's hometown is Wuxi, and his parents died early, leaving no family. It is said that his remains will be examined today and then collected by his teacher, Liu Ziyun, and transported to the Leyuan Funeral Home on Da'xi Road, where colleagues will raise funds to prepare the body for burial.

### Two Suicides

Chen Kaomei: Chen Kaomei, a young student from Shanghai, 17 years old, living at 40 Fulili Road, was studying at the Aurora University Affiliated High School. He went out at 3 PM on the 18th and did not return all night. When he returned home at 8 AM the next morning, he went straight into the room to sleep. Soon, he groaned incessantly. His father, Chen Shaowu, discovered that he had taken poison, and his complexion was pale and he could not speak. He was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital, but he died at 10 AM without rescue. The hospital reported this to the police, who sent the body to the morgue to await collection by family members. Bao Manqing: Bao Manqing, a native of Ningbo, 31 years old, living at 5, Lane 128, Jubolai Road, was formerly a ticket seller at the Aresby Road Jai Alai Stadium. He was dismissed due to illness and suffered economic hardship and was unable to afford treatment. He committed suicide by taking poison at 9 AM yesterday. His brother, Bao Liangqing, discovered this and sent him to the Red Cross First Hospital on Haige Road, but he died at noon without success. After the police received the report, they transported the body to the morgue to await examination and collection by family members.

### Sudden Cold Weather Leads to Sharp Increase in Deaths from Freezing and Illness

Recently, the weather suddenly turned cold, as if it were winter. As a result, among the homeless poor and opium addicts on the roads of the French Concession, the number of men, women, old, and young who died from the cold reached as many as 40. The number of children who died from measles and the changing weather has also increased sharply. All were collected by the Tongren Fuwu Fen Hall and provided with coffins for burial.

### Memorable Wedding of the Meng and Xue Families

Yesterday was the wedding of Meng Shifang, the son of Meng Jiale, a prominent entrepreneur in Shanghai, and Miss Xue Juzhen, the daughter of Xue Weizhan, at the Dahongyun Restaurant on Fourth Malu. Qian Woshi was invited to officiate the wedding. Guests from all walks of life gathered in the hall. Cai, a Chinese employee of the Municipal Council, participated in the event, making it a grand occasion for a time.

### Hua Yunlong's Bone-Touching Physiognomy

The famous elder Hua Yunlong studied poetry and books in his youth and entered school as a boy. Later, he lost his sight but was fortunate to be taught bone-touching physiognomy by a master. He meticulously studied numerology, received the inheritance, practiced the art for decades, and spoke frankly about fortune and misfortune without concealment. He is currently setting up his inkstone at the Asia Hotel, Room 437, Sanmaoge Bridge, Aiduya Road. It is said that those who come to consult him recently are almost limited by the threshold.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Tianjin and Shandong were clear and cool, with strong southwesterly and northwesterly winds and blowing dust. Here, it would change from clear to cloudy and cold with northwesterly winds. In the coastal areas south of Ma'an Island and around Dongsha Island, there would be northerly to northeasterly winds.

### Authorities in Academic Circles in This City Launch Academic Lectures

Zhang Shouyong, Feng Bingnan, Tang Wenzhi, Jiang Weiqiao, Nie Yuntai, Li Denghui, Zhao Zhiyou, Ding Fubao, and other authorities in academic circles in this city have launched academic lectures in order to promote academic studies and engage in psychological construction, inviting Chinese and foreign experts to hold public academic lectures. This is indeed an excellent opportunity for generally studious young people. The origins and regulations are recorded below:

(1) Origins: I think that the Chinese nation has been established in East Asia for more than 5,000 years. Whenever the Way is lost and the culture is corrupt, there must be pioneers who promote lecturing in order to save the declining customs and correct people's hearts. Judging from the history of the Han, Sui, Song, and Ming dynasties, the deeds are obvious. I and others tremble at the crisis of the country and mourn the plight of the people, thinking that psychological construction is the most urgent task, and academic prosperity is the foundation of cultivating people. Without flattery, we have launched academic lectures, inviting Chinese and foreign eminent scholars to take charge of lecturing according to their expertise, standing on the Chinese cultural base, and adopting the essence of world theories, hoping to form a trend over time to save the country and the people. May all my comrades be excited to come!

(2) Regulations: 1. This lecture focuses purely on academics, making specialized systematic lectures, and never involves politics. 2. Each lecture in this series is two hours long, and each lecture is an elaboration of a specific topic. If the content of the lecture is too long to be completed at once, it can be continued. 3. Each lecture in this series asks a stenographer to record the lecture and sends the stenographic manuscript to the lecturer for correction in order to prepare for the publication of a special book. If the lecturer writes a manuscript for publication, it is especially welcome. 4. The location and time of the lectures will be announced temporarily before the lectures begin.

### A Study of the Relationship Between Exchange Rates and Gold Prices: The Period When Exchange Rates and Gold Prices Were Unrelated

— Gu Kezi

In the past, Shanghai gold prices were converted according to the ratio of gold to silver. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, they have been calculated by converting the London gold price at the exchange rate. Although our country's exchange rate against the British pound is pegged at one shilling and two and a half pence, the London gold price fluctuates constantly. Therefore, the gold price in Shanghai also fluctuates accordingly. It can be seen that the rise and fall of the Shanghai gold price at that time was affected by the London gold price and had nothing to do with the exchange rate. Therefore, the theoretical formula at that time was:

9.82607 is a fixed number that converts the weight and fineness of pure gold in London into the equivalent amount and color of standard gold. 14.5 is the statutory rate of exchange against the British pound, which can also be regarded as a fixed number. Therefore, only the London gold price changes, and the change in the gold price cannot affect the exchange rate.

In terms of the nature of legal tender, it is a managed currency, which is completely different from the close relationship between the value of general metallic currency and the value of surplus silver. Before the legal tender policy, our country's currency value was often affected by the adverse effects of expensive gold and cheap silver or expensive silver and cheap surplus, resulting in unpredictable changes, and the social economy was often affected. However, under the legal tender system, since gold is not used as the standard and silver is not used as the standard, the exchange rate against foreign currencies is based solely on the nationally determined exchange rate. Therefore, no matter how the price of gold and silver changes, it has nothing to do with the exchange rate. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that our country's legal tender policy is the most ideal currency system of the time.

The Recombination of Exchange Rates and Gold Prices

However, today, the link between exchange rates and gold prices is once again being emphasized. The theory it relies on:

(1) Gold is an international clearing tool, and on the freely fluctuating black market, the black exchange rate is naturally affected by the gold price.

(2) Since changes in gold prices affect exchange rates, changes in exchange rates naturally affect gold prices.

Therefore, changes in foreign exchange rates can affect gold prices, and changes in foreign gold prices can also affect our country's foreign exchange rates. As a result, the Shanghai gold price fluctuates wildly, and the black market exchange rate also fluctuates wildly. Speculators are also justified in stirring up trouble: whenever the gold price rises, the black market exchange rate shrinks proportionally; conversely, it extends proportionally, without exception.

Trying to trace the waxing and waning process of exchange rates and gold prices in recent years, there is one fact that is particularly noteworthy. That is, at the beginning of the emergence of the black market for foreign exchange, the change in the Shanghai gold price was often affected by the exchange rate. At the beginning of the escalation of the European war and even the outbreak of the war, the Shanghai gold price changed from a passive position affected by the exchange rate to an active position dominating the exchange rate. However, as of today, either the change in the exchange rate is the cause of the change in the gold price, or the change in the gold price results in the change in the exchange rate. There seems to be a reason for this change in relationship. In short:

(1) In the early days of the black market for foreign exchange, the black exchange rate fluctuated extremely sharply. At that time, the foreign gold price and the exchange rate between the United Kingdom and the United States were still relatively stable. Therefore, gold speculators had no excuse to raise the gold price, and could only use the shrinking exchange rate as the basis for the gold price to rise. Because the exchange rate has shrunk, the foreign gold price calculated by converting it may not rise, but the Shanghai gold price can rise independently. This created the era of exchange rates dominating gold prices.

(2) Around the time when the war clouds in Europe were escalating, there was a large-scale flight of capital from London, and the exchange rate between the United Kingdom and the United States shrank repeatedly. Therefore, although the New York gold price remained fixed, the London gold price, which was calculated by converting the New York gold price due to the repeated shrinkage of the exchange rate between the United Kingdom and the United States, rose sharply. At that time, our country's exchange rate was still stable and had many relaxing factors. However, foreign exchange speculators suppressed our country's foreign exchange rate due to the decline in the exchange rate between the United Kingdom and the United States, believing that it was the relationship that should exist in the Sino-British monetary alliance. In addition, the London gold price rose sharply, and the Shanghai gold price, which was converted from it, also rose accordingly. At this time, the rise in the gold price was extremely rapid, so the impact on our country's exchange rate was also extremely significant. This is the reason why the phenomenon of the gold price dominating the exchange rate was created for a while.

(3) The sea gold price is transferred along with the foreign gold price. In the past, it was calculated based on the New York gold price. However, since the United States controlled the gold price at US$35 per ounce, it was changed to calculation based on the London gold price. However, since the outbreak of the European war, the United Kingdom has also begun to control the gold bullion market and has also fixed the official price at £8 and 8 shillings per ounce. Therefore, the Shanghai gold price has lost its calculation basis. If our country's exchange rate does not change, the Shanghai gold price can also be fixed and slightly changed. However, foreign exchange speculators are constantly agitating, so the Shanghai gold price is still changing constantly by converting the unchanged foreign gold price at the fluctuating exchange rate. The constant change in the gold price also affects the black market exchange rate. This has created the situation today where exchange rates and gold prices are mutually causal.

The Relationship Between Subject and Object Changes

Today, the traded item in the Shanghai gold market is not standard gold but pure gold with a fineness of 997. Therefore, to convert the New York gold price into the Shanghai gold price, the formula is:

35.1648 is a fixed number, which is the result of converting the official price of one ounce of pure gold in New York at US$35 into ten Shanghai taels with a fineness of 997.

Judging from the recent trends in the Shanghai gold price and the black exchange rate, the two do seem to be following each other, with proportional advances and retreats. If we look at the market since August of last year: the day when the exchange rate is the tightest is always the time when the gold price is the most expensive; conversely, the gold price on that day is also the smallest. However, since January of this year, although the trend is roughly the same, the breadth of the change seems to have been greatly different.

Is the gold price dominating the exchange rate? Or is the exchange rate dominating the gold price? The following table can give a general idea.

Based on this: when the US dollar exchange rate was loose to US$5.4375 and US$5.625 on January 20 of this year, the surplus price was 6930 and 6600 yuan. When the exchange rate was tight to US$5.125 and US$5.28125 on March 25, the gold price was only 6725 and 6568 yuan, and its pace and breadth are particularly inconsistent. What caused this inconsistent breadth? In a word, it is purely caused by the internal long and short sides of the market competing with each other, pulling hard and pressing hard. In essence: the former is the hard pull of the gold bulls, so regardless of whether the exchange rate is loose to 5.625 yuan, the gold price can be as expensive as more than 6,900 yuan (according to the above formula, the gold price should be only 6,322 yuan). Now, under the strong pressure of the shorts, the purpose is different. (According to the above formula, when the exchange rate is 5.28125, the gold price should reach more than 6,668 yuan) Is today's black market for foreign exchange entering the era dominated by the gold price again?

Mr. Lu Dingcheng: The formula for calculating the price of the alloy of US dollar exchange is requested. You can read this article instead of replying separately.

### Seeing! Hearing! Thinking!

Professor Warren of the United States and others once suggested to President Roosevelt that he advocate a currency revolution and implement a commodity standard currency system. In the end, it was dismissed as a fantasy and not adopted. In recent days, "Joint Notes" and "Japanese Military Tickets" have risen in price relative to the legal currency: it is said that a large amount of opium is being shipped from North China to Shanghai for smooth sales, which has led to the situation of increased water in the Shanghai-Tianjin exchange rate. This statement may be true. Therefore, Chengzhe Nai said: In the occupied areas of North China, it is possible to implement a kind of "opium standard" currency system to save the currency without reserve. Although this statement is a bit abusive, Professor Warren's proposal is not subject to the criticism of fantasy.

After seeing the prosperity in the barbed wire fence, read the book "The Adventurer's Paradise", and its taste is endless!

### Observing Shanghai's Prices from Statistical Figures

Liu Tiesun

Introduction

The rise in prices during wartime is an inevitable phenomenon. However, rising prices directly affect the people's living standards and indirectly affect the country's combat capability. Therefore, various countries in wartime economic organizations attach equal importance to stabilizing currency values and controlling prices. Since the outbreak of the war in our country, the rise in prices in various places has been on a scale of great increase. In the free areas of the mainland, prices have soared because the government has not yet strictly enforced controls. In Shanghai, due to the special environment, the soaring prices are like unbridled horses, with no end in sight. Regarding the issue of prices in the mainland, it is difficult to discuss for the time being due to incomplete data. As for the issue of prices in Shanghai, newspapers and magazines have already been common, so there is no need to continue to add to the story. However, this article collects various statistical figures related to the issue of prices, so as to observe the dynamics of prices. The materials used are all based on 1936 as the base period, in order to represent the normal state of the city. Now, the worker's living cost index compiled by the Public Concession Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Council is listed as follows:

From the above table, the annual average of the total index did not increase much during the Shanghai War in 1937, only an increase of 18.15 compared to 1936. In 1938, it increased by 34.75 compared to 1937, and only 52.90 compared to 1936. In 1939, it increased by 50.35 compared to 1938, and has increased by 103.25 compared to 1936. The price of that year showed a sharp increase. In 1940, it increased sharply by 234.97 compared to 1939, and by 338.22 compared to 1936. The total index in December 1940 was 579.70, and its increase was the highest peak after the war. At the same time, the purchasing power of currency dropped from 84.64 in 1937 to 65.40 in 1938, which was half of that before the war. The annual average in 1940 was 22.82, and 17.25 in December. That is to say, a person with a monthly income of 100 yuan only has 17 yuan and 25 cents before the war, and the difficulty of life can be imagined. Furthermore, in terms of the classification index of the annual average, compared to the end of 1940 and 1936: food increased by 561 points; rent increased by 248 points; clothing increased by 319 points; fuel increased by 451 points; miscellaneous items increased by 373 points. In terms of the order of the magnitude of increase in each year: in 1938, rent (the Public Concession Bureau conducted surveys in January and July of each year, and the figures for February to June and August to December were still used in January and July, so there was no increase or decrease, but it does not mean that the rent did not change at that time.) was the first, followed by fuel, clothing, food, and miscellaneous items; in 1939, it was rent, fuel, food, clothing, and miscellaneous items; the trends in these two years did not change much in general. As for the order in 1940, it was food, fuel, miscellaneous items, clothing, and rent. The order in December was also the same. From this, it can be seen that the increase in prices in 1940 was different from before; that is, it was concentrated on the essential food and fuel. This threat is more serious than in 1938 and 1939.

The worker's living cost index compiled by the Public Concession Bureau includes 31 kinds of food, such as rice, flour, fish, meat, vegetables, and oil, salt, sugar, sauce, etc. There are three kinds of rice and one kind of flour. However, the increase in the number of times of the other 27 kinds of food is not as good as the sum of the four kinds of rice and flour. In recent years, the sharp increase in rice and flour can be seen from the rice and flour market price index compiled by the China Economic Statistics Research Institute:

(Note) From 1936 to July 1937, the average market price of the current month of the flour exchange was used for Changhe machine rice. After August 13, the exchange was closed, and the current price of green soldier ship brand in the open market was used instead, but the factory price was still lower than the repurchase powder market price. From 1936 to 1939, the market price on the 15th of each month was used for Changhe machine rice. From January 1940, the average price of three days, the 5th, 15th, and 25th of each month, was used.

The average price of rice in 1936 was only ten yuan and zero per stone, and it was only between 12.3 yuan in 1937 and 1938. By 1939, it had risen to more than 24 yuan, and the average in 1940 had reached more than 67 yuan. The percentage of the increase was from 2.30 percent to 136 percent, and 545 percent. In terms of monthly figures, it gradually increased from 44 yuan in January 1940. Although there were small returns in the middle, it had reached a high of 107 yuan by the end of the year, which was more than nine times higher than in 1936, and (more than one time) 252 percent higher than in December 1939. The average price of flour was only between 3 yuan and 30 cents and 3 yuan and 60 cents in 1936 and 1937, and more than 4 yuan in 1938. The 5 yuan and 70 cents in 1939 was a gradual increase, but it was not very fierce. The annual average in 1940 had reached more than 14 yuan and 20 cents, which was more than three times higher. The monthly average increased from 9.73 yuan in January 1940 to 18 yuan at the end of the year. Comparing December 1940 with the annual average of 1936, the increase was 438 percent, and comparing it with December 1939, the increase was more than twice as strong as 122 percent. Southerners mainly eat rice, so the increase in flour is more moderate than that of rice.

According to the reasons for the rise in prices, people generally refer to the obstruction of sources, the increase in demand, currency inflation, and the contraction of foreign exchange. Now, they are described separately.

Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, transportation has been greatly hindered. Although transportation has recovered a part after the westward shift of the war, it still cannot be compared with that before the war. The obstruction of sources is indeed a fact, but the extent of the obstruction can be observed from the tonnage of merchant ships entering and leaving the port published by the customs and the freight volume of the two railways, Jinghu and Huhangyong. (Editor's note: attached table omitted)

In 1936, the volume of goods imported and exported by water and land was about 40 million tons. After the war, the railway was opened to traffic by the Japanese, and although the freight volume could not be compared with that before the war, the number should also be quite large. Now, let's ignore it for the time being. Just talking about waterway (numbers see the attached table in the conclusion), 1936 represents the normal state, 21 percent less than that in 1937, 48 percent less than that in 1938, 36 percent less than that in 1939, and 50 percent less than that in 1940. From this, it can be seen that the extent of the so-called obstruction of sources is definitely not more than doubled compared to before the war.

Furthermore, according to the customs records, the quantity and value of imported miscellaneous grains and miscellaneous grain flour and coal are listed as follows: (to be continued)

### U.S. and Indian Cotton Prices Surge

New York U.S. Cotton Telegram: First, it was firm due to purchases by speculators. Then, it rose further due to purchases by spot merchants and short covering. The closing price rose sharply by 23 to 26 points per pound compared to the previous day.

Bombay Indian Cotton Telegram: First, it was tired due to the settlement of long positions. Then, it rose due to purchases of the April-May period and short covering in the July-August period. The closing price of white cotton rose the most, rising 10 rupees, while the rest rose by 1 to 4 rupees. Also, the opening price tomorrow is forecast to rise by another 3 and a half rupees.

### Diaoqing Not Easy to Align

Zhangzhou Diaoqing Sugar: Since Dengxin in Xiang District last winter, the price has been relatively high due to domestic sales activities. The application for alignment is not in line with the situation, and it has not been shipped. Recently, a customer letter reported that the production price needs 60 yuan, plus all external expenses, it must exceed the price of white sugar in Shanghai. Therefore, it is very difficult to approach, and it is difficult to ship to Shanghai in a short time. If there is no special change in the production price in the future, it seems difficult to approach. The prices made open yesterday are listed on the left.

### Maize

— Gao Jiannong

So this kind of plant, maize, has been cultivated and planted by the Indians in the New World for an unknown number of years. Although there are said to be many variations, people have never found a "wild state" that can be regarded as the ancestor of the various maize now. According to De Candolle, a famous plant geographer who has studied the origin of cultivated plants, the method of spreading seeds of maize is extremely clumsy, which is not suitable for survival in the fiercely competitive natural world. Therefore, if it were not for someone among the Indians who accidentally favored and protected it, the disaster of its extinction would probably be difficult to avoid! However, where should the origin of maize in the New World be? De Candolle believes that it is probably in the Andes Mountains in Colombia. From here, the ancient Incas broadcast it to the south, and the Aztecs transported it to the north. In any case, these ancient traces are not easy to trace after Columbus.

Although maize has now been broadcast all over the world, when it leaves its motherland, the New World, it is inevitably affected by "homesickness" and becomes tired and unable to fully develop. It can still thrive to the most ideal level in its native land! For example, take the maize in America now. No other place can grow as tall as fifteen feet there! No other place can live in areas four thousand meters above sea level like there! No other place can have as many varieties as there! — According to varieties: not only are there various colors of yellow, white, red, and light and dark, it is truly jewel-like and worthy of the name "jade" maize. There is a kind of slender and round grain, Ying Jinglang Yao, which the French call Ie muis perle, which is also an excellent footnote to "pearl" rice. There is a kind that contains a lot of sugar, which is widely cultivated in the southern United States and the West Indies, such as sugarcane. There are also dent corn and Cuzco (the capital of the ancient Inca Empire) maize, with huge and slightly curved grains. There is also a peculiar maize in Argentina, where each seed is surrounded by small leaflets: — the name bract should really refer to this kind.

Speaking of the benefits of maize: it is an indispensable item for the Indians to support their lives, so there is no need to say more. Even in the Old World, its power is expanding! Its starch occupies an important position in food and industry. When the stems and leaves are tender, they can be used as hay for cattle and horses. When they are old, they can be used as raw materials for papermaking. As for being used as fuel or padding for sofas and mattresses, it goes without saying. The four large bracts on its ears can wrap miscellaneous items, just like people use cattail leaves or lotus leaves. Even its drooping white beard is a good medicine for urination! — Li Shizhen said: "Boiling the juice from the roots and leaves to drink, it is good for urination." — To say the position occupied by maize in northern China: it and sorghum are already the basic food for the middle and lower classes for three meals a day! As for the way to eat it, in addition to the usual steaming into steamed buns, or frying with soybean oil, the method and flavor are exactly like Shanghai's "fried dough sticks". The most interesting way to eat it is to grind the flour into a paste that is slightly thicker than soy milk, beautifully called "muddy!" — Living in the world now, how can you live without relying on being confused? — A kind of pearl rice that Americans love to eat is called "Pop corn": it is to choose fat and starchy grains, and slightly bake them with fire to make them burst into small white flowers; this is what Li Shizhen said earlier, "can... fry and fold white flowers, like the way to fry glutinous rice."

Finally, let's talk about the history of maize's transmission to the Old World. According to the Seville City Government archives in southern Spain, in 1500 AD, eight years after the discovery of the New World, a batch of maize seeds for planting had already been obtained. The first planting of maize in France was in 1560, and at this time, botanists had records describing and depicting it. As for Asia, we only know that four years after the discovery of the New World, — 1496 — the Portuguese had already arrived in Java. Magellan had already sailed to the Philippine Islands in 1512 AD. Who brought the precious seeds of maize to the above-mentioned places and then to our country? I can't guess this mystery now. I'll wait to discover it and then reveal it!

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### Infant Clothing, Food, Shelter, and Transportation

— Sun Choucheng

This year, April 4th marks the 10th Children's Day. The Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association has joined with sixteen groups, including the Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Protection Section, the Shanghai Parental Education Research Association, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Education Office, the Shanghai Poor Children's Relief Center, the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association, the Shanghai Street Children's Education Association, the Shanghai Children's Hospital, and the China Relief Society for Women and Children, to organize the Shanghai 10th Anniversary Children's Day Preparatory Committee. Its purpose is to encourage children's interests, inspire their love for the community, the country, and their families, and to awaken society to the cause of children's welfare, with the ultimate goal of establishing a children's library in Shanghai. Therefore, various schools are scheduled to hold entertainment programs, host tea parties for refugee children, visit parks, distribute gifts, and watch movies on that day. Children are the future masters of our country and should not be regarded as personal possessions to be abused at will. Therefore, the methods concerning the health care of infants in terms of clothing, food, shelter, and transportation are recorded below, hoping that parents will pay special attention.

"Clothing": Infants have incomplete development, so the clothes they wear should be soft in texture and appropriate in style. They should not be too warm or too cold. Therefore, those made of cotton and flannel are the most suitable, and comfort should be the main consideration. If they are too tight, the lungs will be obstructed when crying, which will hinder development. If they are too loose, they are prone to catch colds and get sick. Inner and outer clothing should be washed and changed frequently, and the undershirt is best white. After undressing before bathing and going to bed, let them play and jump around, so that the muscles and bones of the whole body can take advantage of this activity. "Food": Breastfeeding should be scheduled, once every four hours. It is forbidden to breastfeed every time they cry, because crying is exercise for infants and will not cause illness. Breastfeeding at night should only be done twice, and weaning should be done after one year old. If it is summer, it can be postponed until autumn. Weaning should be done gradually, not abruptly. At five months, you can drink rice soup, and after seven months, you can eat porridge, but not too much. After one year old, you can eat soft rice, millet porridge, wheat paste, etc., and eat more vitamin A and vitamin D to prevent xerophthalmia and rickets (osteomalacia). "Shelter": It is best for infants to sleep alone in a bed, and not be exposed to cold or overheating. The indoor temperature is best at 70-80 degrees Fahrenheit, and doors and windows should be opened frequently to ventilate. Before six months, they should sleep for 18 hours a day. At one year old, it can be reduced to 15 hours. Do not hold them or shake their bodies when sleeping. Bathe once a day. Develop good bowel habits from a young age to ensure regularity. It is advisable to hold them on time every morning. Yellow color and soft texture are the norm. If it turns green and thin, or with mucus, and the number of times increases, the amount of food should be reduced and a doctor should be consulted. "Transportation": Although infants cannot walk alone, crying, kicking, and stretching their upper limbs, gradually learning to crawl, are all natural movements and should not be restricted. They should be taken advantage of and guided. If it is not winter, if the weather is fine, they should be taken out and exposed to sunlight to strengthen their bones, but their faces should not face the sun, and they should not be allowed to approach people with tears, tuberculosis, or coughs. Do not take them to crowded places or the homes of sick relatives and friends. Weight and height are also fixed. One month old weighs 8.5 pounds and is 21 inches long. They grow month by month. Two months old weigh 27 pounds and are 23 inches long. Regular measurements should be taken every month. If they are too light, a doctor should be consulted immediately for examination.

### Talking About Wearing Shoes and Socks

— Plum Blossom

With the soaring prices of goods, shoes and socks have also risen alarmingly. An ordinary pair of socks costs at least one yuan or more, still the same quality as two or three jiao before. As for linen and silk socks, they are even more expensive. As for shoes, a pair of straight tribute cloth shoes currently costs seventeen or eighteen yuan. Even a pair of cloth shoes costs six or seven yuan. Leather shoes are even more outrageous, costing forty or fifty yuan a pair. Therefore, in today's life, in addition to being threatened by food and housing, clothing, shoes, and socks are also difficult to afford. Among them, shoes and socks are considered the cheapest. In the past, the so-called shoe and sock money for an apprentice during the apprenticeship period was only one or two yuan. It can be seen that in the past, this expenditure was not much considered. However, now it is difficult. On average, it costs at least ten yuan or more per month, and it is still considered a small shoe and sock expense.

Therefore, we must also change our thinking in this regard and try our best to tighten our belts to reduce the burden on life. The methods that I have implemented are written below:

All socks are fitted with sock bottoms. Fitting a sock bottom makes them more durable, and the durability can be increased by more than double. Secondly, wash them more often. When washing, be gentle. Also, do not use too much force when wearing them. Often some people wear socks and pull them up forcefully, so that they are straight and wrinkle-free. How can they not be easily damaged? As the weather gradually gets hotter, we can advocate changing to short socks, because the price is relatively cheaper. As for some people who do not like to fit sock bottoms, it is said to be shabby. In fact, this is really thinking too much. Think about it, who would pay attention to your sock bottoms when you wear them in your shoes?

Speaking of wearing shoes, you can keep a pair of old shoes. During the day, we wear very neat shoes outside, because they look presentable. However, when we get home, we can take off our shoes, dust them off, and put them in the shoe box, and change into old shoes. Fortunately, it doesn't matter at home. Take them out and put them on again the next morning. In this way, a pair of shoes will not break down easily. Secondly, practice wearing cloth shoes, which is much more economical, and they are much more durable than bought ones. Although it looks a bit ugly to walk out, we should think that we are in a very difficult time now.

Tianchu Recipe

### (87) Celtuce

— Draft by Yao Mingjiong

Celtuce, also known as stem lettuce, its leaves and stems (i.e., shoots), are rich in nutrition. The stems can be eaten raw, and the leaves should be cooked before eating. Now, its preparation method is listed below:

(A) Raw Marinated Fragrant Celtuce Stems

Preparation: Celtuce stems, salt, sesame oil, Tianchu soy sauce essence

Preparation: Peel off the outer skin of the celtuce stems, wash them, and cut them into diamond-shaped pieces. Then marinate them with salt. After marinating for several hours, take them out. When eating, drip an appropriate amount of Tianchu soy sauce essence and sesame oil. The taste will be refreshing and delicious. It is even better if it is served with porridge. This is truly a hygienic delicacy for meals in spring and summer.

(B) Fragrant Celtuce Leaf Stewed Tofu

Preparation: Slightly tender fragrant celtuce leaves, bamboo shoots, tender tofu, sugar, soybean oil, soy sauce, MSG, salt

Preparation: Wash the fragrant celtuce leaves and cut them into pieces about an inch long. Peel off the bamboo shoots and cut them into slices or pieces. First, fry the tender tofu in an oil pot for a while, then pour the celtuce leaves and bamboo shoot slices or pieces in at the same time and stir-fry them. Then add an appropriate amount of soy sauce, sugar, salt, MSG, etc. and cook them. Wait until the bamboo shoots are cooked and it is done.

### One Week's Home-Style Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Recently, the price of eggs has become cheaper. One yuan of legal tender can buy six or seven. Regarding dishes made with eggs, I like "cold mixed" the most. That is, after mixing the yolk and white of the eggs, spread them into egg skin, cut them into thick strips, add shredded pork steamed over water and chive sprouts soaked in boiling water, and then mix them with good vinegar. This is called "cold mixed", and it is most suitable for serving with porridge or drinking wine. If you want something simpler, then just mix chive sprouts with egg skin. When lice crabs (a kind of small crab about the size of a fingernail) are on the market, you can also mix them with egg skin and spread them together, called crab paste skin, which is very delicious and also a wonderful product for drinking wine.

Monday: Shredded pork mixed with egg skin, scallion baked crucian carp, braised cabbage, jellyfish radish shreds

Tuesday: Beef stewed with broad beans, sweet and sour yellow croaker, stir-fried oil vegetables with vermicelli, pickled vegetables, bean sprouts

Wednesday: Cauliflower stir-fried with sliced pork, braised carp, stir-fried bamboo shoots with wolfberries, preserved bamboo shoots with tofu flower

Thursday: Curry shredded beef, chive sprouts mixed with egg skin, braised vegetarian assorted delicacies, sesame sauce mixed with horse-tooth amaranth

Friday: Shredded pork stewed with tofu, braised fresh fish, dried tofu shreds with alfalfa, pickled vegetables with mung bean sprouts

Saturday: Cauliflower stir-fried with diced chicken, stir-fried eel paste with bamboo shoots, spinach vermicelli soup, braised radish slices

Sunday: Duck giblet soup, steamed knife fish, stir-fried shepherd's purse, mixed lettuce

### Soy Sauce and Stomach Diseases

— Qing Cong

Opening the door to seven things: oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, firewood, rice, and tea; it is well known that soy sauce is indeed one of the main daily necessities for the family. When distinguishing soy sauce, people only seek its color and taste, and few can reach the quality of its quality. What few know is that soy sauce of poor quality, although dark in color and fresh in taste, is harmful to health and is even more harmful. This is something that housewives must pay attention to. According to Mr. Li Youfang of Hengshun Sauce and Vinegar Factory, soy sauce sold in the market is nothing more than two types: one is brewed by ancient methods, and the other is refined chemically. The former is made of soybeans, with pure materials and rich in nutrition. Not only is the taste fresh and suitable, but it can also help cooking. However, the manufacturing method is slow and the procedures are cumbersome. Therefore, most of what is sold in the market is chemical soy sauce, which is made with hydrochloric acid instead of soybean cake, or by taking the discarded residue from seasoning powder and refining it. Therefore, eating it for a long time is enough to cause disease and damage the stomach. The number of people in Shanghai who suffer from stomach diseases has increased significantly in recent years, and this is indeed a major reason. Hengshun Factory is located in Zhenjiang and has a history of nearly a hundred years. The Shanghai general distributor is located on Avenue Road. The soy sauce produced is brewed in accordance with ancient methods and produced using scientific procedures. The color, aroma, and taste are all excellent, and it is especially clean and hygienic. It is truly the authentic soy sauce and a blessing for the family. Mr. Li also presented the family knowledge about soy sauce formerly written by Mr. Tianxu Wosheng to prove that his words were not wrong. Tianxu Wosheng said: If chemical soy sauce is not properly formulated, resulting in excessive acid and failing to change its neutral nature, it is easy to cause stomach diseases, or even the hydrochloric acid itself contains arsenic, which is even more dangerous. If the amount of alkali used to neutralize it is excessive, then the gastric acid in the stomach will be inhibited and neutralized, so that the protein in the food cannot be digested, causing chest congestion, weakness, and other symptoms. Seeing this, the use of soy sauce must be carefully considered.

### A Method to Eradicate All Rats

— Kaiyang

There are many rats in my house, and they disturb me at night, making it impossible to sleep peacefully. Clothes and objects are often damaged. Although I try my best to catch them, I cannot control their violence. While I was worried and resentful, I happened to read in the Compendium of Materia Medica: "If you mix crab shells with raw lacquer and burn the smoke, all the rats will come." I was surprised and tried it. In a moment, five rats came, followed by eight small rats. I quickly caught them and put them in a cage. After that, the night was silent. It can truly be said to be a wonderful method for catching rats.

Currently, the population of the isolated island is increasing, and often three or four families live in one house, making it very easy for plague to occur, causing tragedy. Therefore, I specifically reveal this to newspapers, hoping that readers who have rats in their homes will try it to prevent the disease. (Repay the kindness)

### Visiting Jiying Cottage

— Zheng Yimei

Mr. Xu Chengbo of Shugang, formerly my neighbor, his Qinglai Pavilion's pen bed, inkstone box, painting case, and book bag, occasionally recalled, are still in my mind. Since the incident occurred, you moved to Shanhai Pass Road, named it Jiying Cottage, and invited me to read books. Last night, I went to visit. Your painting studio is on the top floor. The desk is filled with ink and paper. You looked at your wife to the left and played with your young children to the right, while the creation was under your pen, painting clouds and smoke. The joy you have cannot be compared to that of lonely artists. The wall is Zhang Nongran's couplet: "Discussing Xuan He with you in detail, taking the time to occasionally imitate the official books." You are happy to copy the Song people, and to touch Zhang Heinu. Qi Baishi's peony frame, national beauty and heavenly fragrance, portrays the spirit perfectly, and the inscription says: "It is best to paint peonies richly, if compared to chrysanthemums, they are thin and cold, it loses the peony's posture, and it is not a good work." It is also very gratifying. You have newly mounted hundreds of standing scrolls, all requested by friends. You spent half a year's effort, burning the midnight oil to complete them, naming them ink-green paintings, which will be displayed at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to satisfy the eyes of the society, and I was the first to see them, making this trip worthwhile. Most of the paintings depict Mount Huang, using the real scenery and integrating it with the hills and valleys in your heart, with the intention of being similar but not similar. Therefore, you surpass the common and vulgar, and are not comparable to ordinary products. Others, such as the charming ladies, the lofty figures, the ancient and gorgeous flowers, the sparse bamboo and rocks, each frame has a different style, each painting has a different appearance, yin and yang open and close, and the changes are endless, and I walked around and looked at the flowers, and my eyes were dazzled with colors. At that time, the crowd had rested, and the demolition sound gradually rose, so I hired a streetcar and returned.

Spring and Autumn

### Strolling the Streets When I Have Nothing to Do

— Little Woodwind

(1) Flourishing Incense Fire

Running past Situ Temple, I took a look inside. The incense smoke was swirling and the people were crowded. I thought to myself - anyway, I have nothing to do now, I might as well run in and take a look around, broaden my horizons. So, I stepped in.

Sure enough, it was filled with "good men and women," everyone desperately taking out money to buy incense candles and paper ingots, lighting them, burning them. A large vat was filled with tin foil ash, but there were still people throwing piles of paper ingots into it. The incense candle racks were full, and those who came later couldn't wait, pulled out the incense candles that had just been lit, threw them into the prepared dustpan next to them, and inserted their own, without any consideration. It is said that these do not count as sacrifices, as long as they express a little "sincerity" in front of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas!

Piles of "good men and women" squeezed together to bow directly to the plaque of "Compassionate Navigation to Universal Salvation" and the mud statues, looking very "devout"!

I was staring in a daze when I was suddenly stepped on. "There are so many people!" I thought to myself: This is a bottomless pit, tens of thousands of dollars are flowing away here for nothing, and a lot of time is wasted. (The good men and women must say: Amitabha! You are a sinner!)

But, someone next to me was answering me, or reminding me, saying:

"Today is July 15th!"

I quickly pulled out my foot and walked out, walking towards the door. I saw a ragged "believer" crawling on the ground, biting a string of long ingots in her mouth, and also incense and candles, crawling straight in. It is said that this is the most devout, and the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will definitely "bless" her!

I ran out and took a breath. I was thinking again - I'm afraid that ragged "believer" can't even afford rice, it's really: the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas bless!

(2) Thriving Business

Leaving Situ Temple, running west, I arrived at the silk and satin shop of a newly opened store. The entrance was crowded with people. It is said that it just opened today, and there are "cheap goods" to "grab"!

Looking over from the crowd, I saw three or four patrol officers and four or five members of the International Settlement Corps maintaining order.

Taking a closer look, I saw that there was also a long line set up at the entrance, like the entrance of a rice shop with price controls. It turned out that the store was already "full" and several people had to come out before a few people could go in. It was a chaotic mess and hindered traffic, so the patrol officers "took it upon themselves" and came up with a solution - a long line.

But, outside the long line, there were still idlers standing, piles on the east, piles on the west, craning their necks to look inside. As a result, they were dispersed!

It's really "thriving business"! But... never mind, take another look around the streets!

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(5) The Dividing Line Between Love and Desire

But the night before, he still couldn't make himself sit peacefully in the Tianjin Hotel. He hesitated for a long time, and as a result, he still went to Luo's house at No. 34 Liangmi Street for dinner; and because he was about to part ways tomorrow, he couldn't help but linger a little longer.

"It's funny to say," the power of the wine had added a layer of redder than rouge to Xiangqi's face, "you are also a popular actor after all, but I have never heard you sing a single line..."

"Why didn't you say so earlier? Otherwise, I would have brought the huqin!" Begonia, after drinking, couldn't help but be much more excited than usual. "How about I sing a passage for you now?"

"Of course it's good," Xiangqi said, looking at Begonia.

Begonia immediately stood up from the side of the dining table, so excited that he forgot all his worries, and immediately wanted to face the wall and sing a passage from his most skilled play for Xiangqi.

"Slow down!" Xiangqi picked up a chopstick and pointed it at Begonia. "Don't sing those Qingyi Huadan plays, I don't like to listen to those!"

"What should I sing then?"

"Can you also sing Xiaosheng plays?"

"Why not!" Begonia tilted his face, staring at Xiangqi with eyes that were already seven or eight points drunk. Xiangqi couldn't help but smile at him very coquettishly. The clock on the wall was striking nine, the sounds of dong... dong... dong... swaying in the air, not disappearing for a long time, but both of them seemed not to have heard it.

"There is a passage where Luo Cheng shouts at Guan Dao, which is quite impassioned, would you like to hear it?" From the frank conversations of the past three or four days, Begonia had fully recognized Xiangqi's personality, knowing that only this type of play was what she loved to hear.

"Sing it lower!" Xiangqi said softly. (68)
