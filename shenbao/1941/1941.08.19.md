### Roosevelt and Hull Hold Extensive Talks: Meticulous Review of the International Situation; Washington Focuses on the Far East; US and UK Determined to Jointly Prevent Further Japanese Advancement

Washington, 17th – Since Roosevelt's return to Washington, all eyes here have been fixed on the Far East. The President and Secretary of State Hull conferred for two hours. Well-informed sources believe that the discussions largely centered on how to halt Japan's expansionist ambitions, the UK, US, and Soviet Union, and the upcoming Moscow conference. Although London has reported that the Soviet Union is willing to actively participate in the "anti-Japanese movement," the US delegation to Moscow will still explore to what extent Stalin is willing to cooperate with the UK and US in jointly resisting Japan's southward expansion. It is widely believed in Washington diplomatic circles that Japan will not immediately invade Thailand or Siberia, extending the European war to the Pacific. However, various circles here believe that the development of events is prompting Japan to make a decision on peace sooner rather than later, so the final juncture is not far off. Since 31 British transport ships arrived last week carrying troops to reinforce Singapore, completing the joint defense of the South Pacific, and since Roosevelt and Churchill announced the eight-point declaration of war aims and plans for rebuilding peace, Japan's actions have undoubtedly become more cautious. The official details of Roosevelt and Churchill's talks at sea have not been released, but according to well-informed sources, one of their most important decisions is that they believe the Soviet Union will survive this winter's fighting. Therefore, the democratic nations should now concentrate their efforts on the Far East, using peaceful or military means to detach Japan from the Axis. It is also said that Churchill has allowed Roosevelt to use the Singapore base at any time should war with Japan break out.

United Press, Washington, 18th – President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull held a two-and-a-half-hour talk on Far Eastern and European issues. Well-informed sources indicated that the meeting focused more on Far Eastern events. It was also said that the Japanese situation was reviewed with a very serious attitude, and even the plight of Americans trapped in Japan was discussed. Some sources even said that economic pressure on Japan was discussed at the time. Hull later told reporters that the talks were merely an exchange of general information. "We simply informed each other of the latest international situation. We also discussed various situations that interested us." Hull declined to offer any specific criticism. However, the fact that President Roosevelt was met at the train station by Hull upon his return to Washington and that such a long meeting took place immediately afterward could not but impress people, leading them to believe that a major development in the Far East, if not imminent, has already occurred, necessitating an immediate review by the two men. President Roosevelt's remarks to reporters last Saturday that he had reached an understanding with British Prime Minister Churchill on various diplomatic policies further strengthened the general belief that the President's long talk with Hull was to convey the British decision to participate in the Far Eastern process and the British readiness to support the United States in resisting further Japanese advances. At the same time, Lord Beaverbrook, the British Minister of Supply who attended the maritime conference, had lunch yesterday with Harry Hopkins, the American coordinator of aid to Britain, at the White House. They were clearly discussing the supply of military goods for the UK, US, and Soviet Union. It is reported that President Roosevelt arrived in Washington at 10:30 AM, and Hull personally greeted him at the station before heading to the White House for talks. The President plans to meet with congressional leaders, Vice President Wallace, Senate Majority Leader Barkley, Speaker of the House Rayburn, and House Majority Leader McCormack on Monday.

Reuters, Washington, 18th – It is reported that President Roosevelt discussed the international situation with Secretary of State Hull at the White House yesterday, focusing on the Far Eastern crisis and Vichy's relationship with Germany. Congressional leaders will meet with the President today to discuss another Lend-Lease appropriation of over $1 billion. It is widely believed that the President and Secretary of State also discussed developments in the Far East, such as Japan's various restrictions on the voyage of the President Coolidge. When the President's yacht returned to Rockland on Saturday, a single anti-aircraft gun was seen mounted on the deck. During a press conference held on board, the President was asked if he would broadcast a fireside chat about the maritime conference. The President replied, "That depends on you. If you provide the nation with accurate information, I will not need to broadcast."

### Vichy Orders Ban on Vietnam Rubber Trade

International News Service, Vichy, 18th – The Vichy government yesterday ordered the cancellation of all contracts for Vietnamese rubber. The aim of this move is to cut off the flow of rubber to the UK and US, which the government does not deny. An official statement announced the order, saying it was done in the interests of the people. It is said that both futures and spot transactions are prohibited. No remedies were mentioned for companies holding contracts. Although the new regulations have no exceptions, it is widely believed that Germany and Japan will easily obtain rubber in Vietnam and will benefit from the end of competition from democratic countries. Observers say that Vichy's submission to Axis pressure has reached its peak with this order, following the freezing of Axis funds by the UK and US. This is France's only move to deal with the UK and US economically.

### Japan to Decide on War or Peace Within Ten Days: Anglo-American Pressure Sufficient to Make Japan Consider; Araki Says Should Not Rely on Foreign Countries

Havas, Washington, 17th – Diplomatic circles here say that Japan will decide on the issue of war or peace within ten days. If Japan maintains the status quo, this is peace. Conversely, if it seeks to advance south into Thailand or north into Siberia, war will inevitably break out and spread throughout the Pacific. However, it is believed that Japan does not want to expand the war to the Pacific. The recent meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill clearly devoted considerable time to discussing the Far East. However, President Roosevelt declared that he did not believe the US was now close to war, which is significant. It is implied that the pressure from the UK and US is sufficient to make Japan carefully consider its actions. Other factors include: first, the UK, US, and Soviet Union will hold a conference in Moscow; second, the US is stepping up aid to the UK and Soviet Union in all aspects, especially aircraft; third, Thailand is firmly resisting Japanese pressure; fourth, China's war against Japan is becoming increasingly active; fifth, French forces have arrived in Malaya and Burma for reinforcement; and sixth, the UK, US, and Netherlands are implementing economic sanctions against Japan. All these factors are important for maintaining peace in the Pacific.

Havas, Tokyo, 17th – Former Army Minister Araki recently told a reporter from the Hochi Shimbun that when Imperial Russia collapsed in 1918, Japan occupied Siberia. At this time, this historical fact will be re-enacted before our eyes. The Siberian incident can truly be called the beginning of our country's continental policy. Unfortunately, at this time, people from all walks of life in the country are obstructing the government from making bold decisions to promote its established national policy. Although our goals are very correct, we failed to make decisive decisions. Also, because we are deeply afraid of provoking the United States, we do not know how to adopt a clear policy. This is completely different in Germany, which is admirable. But Japan should not rely on foreign countries but should rely only on its own strength. In short, if we want to implement national policy and achieve success, then we must take clear and unchanging measures. Therefore, our country should first clarify the national policy to the whole country and then work hard to move forward.

Japanese Newspapers Monitor Moscow Conference

Reuters, Tokyo, 18th

Japanese sources state that Tokyo newspapers view the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration as a smokescreen for a military alliance between the UK, US, and Soviet Union. The proposed Moscow three-nation conference and the UK-Soviet consultations are all factors contributing to this trend. The Asahi Shimbun warned the public to pay attention to the direction the Moscow talks will take, saying that the UK and US may have already agreed on the pressure to be applied to Japan. It also said that according to news from New York, there is talk of the danger that now exists in the Vladivostok area. That port is currently the only route for British and American aid to the Soviet Union. Almost all the newspapers consider the eight-point declaration as a de facto military alliance of the three countries. The Miyako Shimbun said that the declaration shows that the UK and US are now trying to use the pretext of struggling to defend world peace and human freedom to maintain their world hegemony. The keen desire of the UK and US is for Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan to exhaust their military strength in a war of attrition. The UK and US also entice the Soviet Union to openly oppose Japan in order to achieve their shameful conspiracy to curb Japan's southward advance.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 18th – The Nichi Nichi Shimbun yesterday published an article warning the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Union's rejection of the UK and US sending permanent observers to Moscow is the most significant thing from the Kremlin. If the Soviet Union accepts this proposal, Japan will regard it as a measure to encircle Japan. The Hochi Shimbun yesterday commented on the Soviet Union's exchange of raw materials and other goods with the UK and US, saying that if the Soviet Union's cooperation with the UK and US makes Soviet-Japanese relations worse, this is Moscow's own fault. The newspaper pointed out that this agreement will inevitably affect Japanese-Soviet relations.

### US Ambassador Grew Visited Japanese Foreign Minister Yesterday Afternoon: Discussed Important Pending Issues, Including Shipping and Evacuation of Nationals

United Press, Tokyo, 18th – US Ambassador to Japan Grew visited Foreign Minister Toyoda this afternoon. The purpose of the visit was not announced, but the most important pending issues between the US and Japan are the shipping issue, the unfreezing of diplomatic funds, and the permission for Americans wishing to leave Japan and general American nationals to withdraw. Some observers here believe that Japan is delaying resolving the shipping and unfreezing issues in order to further study the attitude of the UK and US, to see whether the UK and US will only threaten with measures short of war or whether there will be the most unfortunate consequences. It is noteworthy that Japanese newspapers carry news from London and Washington saying that the UK and US have even hinted that if Japan takes no further action, the UK and US are willing to explore whether it is possible to restore trade. However, the Asahi Shimbun suspects that this news is merely clever propaganda from the UK and US. The exact reason why Japan has not accepted the American proposal to unfreeze the funds of diplomatic personnel has not been known, but observers speculate that Japan wants to obtain a broader unfreezing agreement before Japan can implement any unfreezing. Currently, the obstacle to shipping negotiations is Washington's failure to ensure favorable terms, and the US's current concern seems to be to obtain a way to evacuate American nationals. A survey of one hundred Americans by the United Press found that they have all reached the Japanese side's freezing limit because the Japanese side restricts American nationals' monthly expenses to no more than 500 yen, which is only one-third of the average monthly expenditure of ordinary Americans in Tokyo. Although it has only been half a month since the freezing restrictions were implemented, those surveyed all said that their expenses for this month have already exceeded 500 yen. For example, the United Press correspondent has not yet received any remittance and relies only on the cash he had before the implementation of the freezing order to maintain himself. The penalty for monthly expenses exceeding 500 yen is imprisonment for six months, and may be commuted or combined with a fine of 5,000 yen. At the same time, the American Embassy here has implemented a twenty-hour shift system due to the tension in Japanese-American relations and the heavy workload. The number of embassy telegrams last month was unprecedented. The embassy usually has no lights on at night, but recently it has been brightly lit every night.

Reuters, Tokyo, 18th – The Japanese government is now intensifying its control over foreigners, especially British and American nationals. The Foreign Ministry has recently notified all embassies, legations, and consulates that all foreigners in Japan who wish to leave the country must obtain permission. Traditionally, only the police authorities need to be notified, but since the new regulations came into effect on August 15, such actions must be approved by the prefectural governor. This request to leave the country must be submitted at least three days before departure, but it is reported that the Japanese government does not intend to create too many difficulties.

### US Congressman Dingell Writes to the President, Advocating Swift Retaliation Against Japan's Refusal to Allow US Evacuation

United Press, Washington, 18th – Michigan Democratic Congressman Dingell said yesterday that he had written to President Roosevelt, requesting that the United States immediately intern 10,000 Japanese nationals in Hawaii in concentration camps. He said, "In this way, the American nationals held hostage by Japan will be on a one-to-one basis." Dingell said that he was not overly sympathetic to the personal situation of the American nationals lingering on, as he had previously ordered them to return home. He said Japan should be given the impression that the United States is determined to protect its interests. He said that if Japan takes retaliatory measures, the United States still has 150,000 Japanese nationals in Hawaii and elsewhere who can serve as "backup personnel for retaliation."

United Press, Washington, 18th – Counselor Ida of the Japanese Embassy here said yesterday that there is currently no consideration of withdrawing Japanese nationals in the United States. It is reported that Consul General Muto of San Francisco has been summoned to Washington to discuss ship issues.

### Thai Government Formally Denies UK Request to Manage Railways; Japanese Entering Thailand Gradually Increasing; Scattered Parks and Cinemas Everywhere

Reuters, Bangkok, 18th – The government gazette formally denies reports that "Britain has requested the Thai government for the management rights of the Aranyaprathet railway, and will use force if not complied with," dismissing it as unfounded. The terminus of this railway is located 150 miles directly east of Bangkok, on the old Thai-Vietnamese border.

Reuters, Bangkok, 18th – A newspaper published an article entitled "Europeans Go, Japanese Come," saying that the number of Japanese flocking to Thailand is gradually increasing. Japanese can be seen everywhere from Bangkok to Songkhla. The upper seats of Bangkok cinemas, which used to be exclusively occupied by Europeans, are now all Japanese audiences. Every weekend, Japanese people are seen frequently in parks and restaurants. Many houses whose rents Thais cannot afford are now rented by Japanese. Japanese have opened shops near government offices.

Reuters, Tokyo, 18th – Thai Ambassador to Japan Sena discussed various issues arising from the current situation with Foreign Minister Toyoda today.

### Japanese Government Plans to Establish New Post

United Press, Tokyo, 18th – The Kokumin Shimbun carried a report today saying that the government is currently planning to establish a "Centralized Affairs Office" in the Cabinet. The head of the office will effectively be the Deputy Prime Minister, and will have the power to supervise various other administrative provinces. Its purpose is to promote and improve plans to establish the country on the basis of total war. The newspaper also said that the Army Minister and Navy Minister both support this proposal.

### Vietnam Organizes Federal Assembly; Governor General Decoux Appoints Deputies

They include officials, lawyers, doctors, teachers, landlords, industrialists, and merchants. This conference is purely a consultative body, similar to France's National Council of State, and may offer opinions on matters the Governor General wishes to consult on for his reference. The term of office for deputies is two years.

Editorial

### An Analysis of the Economic Smokescreen

The essence of economic problems is mostly simple and straightforward, but they are often adorned with titles, which make them seem strange and abstruse, blurring the distinction. Some even cling to stale ideas, flaunting appearances, making it easy for those who manage finances and politics to take things lightly or heavily, and to gain opportunities to act, thus taking advantage of situations without considering the suffering of the people. As the times evolve, economics is of utmost importance. Since the pain is felt deeply, how can we not seek self-healing and self-rescue, but allow a small number of officials to blindly control it? This is why the economic smokescreen must be shattered.

The most historically enduring and emotionally compelling smokescreen is the law of supply and demand and free competition. Abundant supply leads to low prices, high demand leads to high prices, and scarce supply also leads to high prices, while low demand leads to low prices. Merchants therefore weigh surpluses and deficits to balance supply and demand and seek maximum profits. Free competition allows each to display their strengths, promote efficiency, reduce costs, increase production, and lower prices. The superior survive and the inferior are eliminated, evolving naturally. This allows merchants to both secure profits and increase the efficiency of technology. For consumers, it allows them to enjoy affordable goods and the results of the evolution of the times. This is why the law of supply and demand and free competition complement each other, rely on each other for survival, and become the fundamental institutions in traditional economics.

Who can deny the benefits of the law of supply and demand and free competition to the economic development of various countries in the past? But to assert that without this system, today's civilizational progress could not have been achieved is an overstatement. In recent times, restricting free competition and the application of the law of supply and demand has generally maintained past prosperity and progress without any signs of decline. Even in the past, when this system prevailed, there were often many restrictive measures, and the complete system was not absolutely enforced. In Western countries, food, other daily necessities, and medicines have always been subject to strict control under the "Food Hygiene Regulations." What can be sold in stores, what is subject to ban, what is permitted for export, and what is for domestic use only are adjusted according to circumstances. Banks, railways, and all public utilities are subject to the supervision of public management regulations. Not only are the profits of shareholders restricted, but the amount of fees charged and all operating policies are subject to the supervision of special officials. Any violation of the regulations is punished accordingly. Where is the natural supply and demand! Where is the free competition!

During wartime, when control is emphasized, the old order is completely changed. Production, consumption, quality, and prices are all stipulated by the government as a whole, with no room for freedom or autonomy. During the First World War, the American arms industry initially benefited from the law of supply and demand to raise prices due to the competitive purchases of various countries; but it was never heard of that food was allowed to be manipulated by private individuals, allowing them to use the law of supply and demand to achieve their own interests. Milk was only five cents a bottle, salt was only a few cents a pound, and public trams, even for distances as far as ten or twenty miles, only cost five cents. All of these are readily verifiable, and prices were never increased due to the increase in wartime costs to burden the people. The situation in the UK and US today is still the same, which is vastly different from our country. If it is said that the skyrocketing prices in Germany and Russia during the First World War were due to the imbalance of the law of supply and demand and the meddling of control policies, then it would be more accurate to say that it was due to the collapse of the entire economic structure. In other words, when the promotion of control fails to be effective, it proves that the chaos is irrepressible, and the disease has entered the bone marrow.

In short, although various countries have achieved remarkable results after implementing free competition and natural supply and demand systems, this does not mean that the same results cannot be achieved after implementing control. On the contrary, the past experience of abolishing free competition and natural supply and demand shows the benefits of control policies without drawbacks. The future direction of the world economic system is still unpredictable, but the control policy will become the linchpin of the system, and the die is cast. Our country has historically promoted control policies, especially for rice, and therefore has the saying that high grain prices harm the people and low grain prices harm the farmers, and the provinces often use this as a basis for adjusting the people's food supply. Although the food problem has not been solved in the past with the implementation of control, the implementation of free competition in the past thirty years has not seen any certainty in solving the problem. When things reach an extreme, they change, and change leads to progress. Weighing the pros and cons and adapting to the times depends on the authorities' ability to use them well.

### Government Spokesman Chiang Ting-fu Issues Statement: Highly Praises the Joint Anglo-American Declaration; Reports on the Harvest Situation in Various Provinces This Year

Chongqing – Government spokesman Secretary General Chiang Ting-fu commented on the joint declaration of the US President and British Prime Minister at a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters on the 18th and reported on the harvest situation in various provinces this year. The following is a record of Chiang's remarks. Chiang first stated that the declaration of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill is the basic guideline for the world's post-war transformation. Although only the sixth principle listed in the declaration mentions Nazi tyranny, a careful reading of the entire text reveals that this statement is indeed applicable to the entire world. The current war, although seemingly regional, is in fact one, so the post-war transformation of the world must have a unified guideline, and two sets of solutions cannot be used. The items mentioned in the eight principles, such as all countries having territorial integrity, administrative freedom, and enjoying equal treatment in trade and access to raw materials, are worthy of our attention. If they can be realized one by one, although the lands of various countries may differ in size, the opportunities for economic, cultural, political, and social life within their territories will be equal and unrestricted. In short, in order to realize the declaration of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, all peace-loving democratic countries must make greater sacrifices. Our Foreign Ministry has declared that it will fight to the end in order to continue to contribute to the creation of a new world. Regarding the bumper harvest in various provinces, Chiang said that in Sichuan Province, except for more than a dozen counties, the harvests in all counties have doubled compared to last year. Statistics show that the total rice production in Sichuan Province this year has increased by 15% compared to last year. The amount remaining after farmers pay their land tax (in kind) has exceeded last year's total harvest. In particular, the harvest of miscellaneous grains and sweet potatoes has been especially abundant. Other rice-producing provinces in Jiangnan, except for Hubei, are also showing signs of a bumper harvest. As for the wheat-producing provinces in the north, such as Gansu, Shaanxi, and Henan, the harvest is slightly inferior to previous years. Finally, Chiang reported that the Foreign Exchange Management Committee was established some days ago with 15 members: Kong Xiangxi, Chen Guangfu, Yu Hongjun, Chen Hang, Bei Songsun, Xi Demao, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Xu Kan, Zhang Boling, He Yaozu, Chiang Tingfu, Gu Yiqun, Li Yuannan, and Guo Jinkun. Kong Xiangxi is the chairman, and Chen Guangfu, Yu Hongjun, Chen Hang, Bei Songsun, and Xi Demao are the standing committee members. A plenary committee meeting is held once a month, and a standing committee meeting is held once a week.

### "Inside Asia" Has Been Banned

### Britain and the Soviet Union Warn Iran Again to Remove German Threat

Reuters dispatch from the Iranian capital on the 18th: Rumors spread that some Iranians colluded with "foreign agents" in a conspiracy to overthrow the government in August, but it was discovered and some of the ringleaders were arrested and executed.

Foreign rumors have no effect on the unity and patriotism of the Iranian people.

### German Army's Main Offensive Still Focused on Ukraine; Soviets Admit Loss of Kryvyi Rih and Nikolayev Shipyard Has Been Destroyed

Associated Press dispatch from Moscow on the 18th: Although Soviet troops withdrew from the two major Ukrainian cities of Kryvyi Rih and Nikolayev yesterday, the Soviet army facing the approaching German army is still fighting bravely on all fronts today. The German army's main offensive seems to be still focused on Ukraine. Other German troops have reached the railway between Odessa and the Dnieper River and are currently threatening the important iron and coal-producing areas in the southern section of the Dnieper River. Military personnel have recently confirmed the remarks of a certain official spokesperson yesterday, who stated that the southern army led by Butny has not been cut off and is currently fighting bloodily to defend its rear. This morning's communique also stated that the Soviet army had defeated the German 162nd Division, and two other German divisions also suffered heavy casualties and were disorganized. It also stated that before withdrawing from Nikolayev, the Soviet army had destroyed the city's grain cranes and manufacturing plants, making them unusable by the Germans. News from the front lines described the Soviet army's counterattacks in various places. These dispatches stated that the German 90th Infantry Division had lost 70% of its troops, and the German 99th Light Division, mostly cavalry and motorized units, had reportedly lost more than half of its personnel. The German 218th Regiment was reportedly completely annihilated, and the 279th Infantry Regiment suffered 600 deaths and many injuries while besieging a certain Soviet village. It was also stated that the Germans lost 19 aircraft on Saturday, while the Soviets lost 12 aircraft. Furthermore, Soviet submarines reportedly sank two large ships in the Black Sea. News from the Finnish front stated that the Soviet army had destroyed eight bridges, eleven trains, thirty-five aircraft, eighteen tanks, seventy-two transport vehicles, and four armored vehicles in recent days, and killed 480 German and Finnish soldiers and 25 officers.

Reuters dispatch from Moscow on the 18th: The latest Soviet communique admits that Nikolayev on the Black Sea coast and Kryvyi Rih, a major iron ore center, have been lost. The communique stated that after fierce fighting, the Soviet army had withdrawn from these two cities and that the Nikolayev shipyard had been destroyed. There was fierce fighting throughout the line yesterday. On August 16th, a total of 17 enemy aircraft were shot down, and the Soviets also lost 12 aircraft. Soviet submarines in the Black Sea sank two Romanian giant transport ships. The Red Army's organ, Red Star, commented on the telegram from US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill to Stalin, stating that the united alliance of anti-Hitler peoples is a guarantee of victory over fascism. This alliance was formed in the first few days of the German attack on the Soviet Union, and the Red Army's courageous fighting contributed to and strengthened this alliance. The Red Army is currently carrying out its great and glorious mission of destroying fascist barbarism. We are fully satisfied with the assurances provided by Roosevelt and Churchill to Stalin, the head of the Soviet government and People's Commissar for Defense. At a time when the Soviet people and army are doing their best to strike a greater blow against the cunning enemy, the issuance of this telegram is of great significance. The assistance that the United States and Britain plan to provide to the Soviet Union will help this joint effort to defeat Hitlerism. The people currently fighting against fascist savagery still face many difficulties, so it is even more important to ensure the timely and accurate coordination of all efforts in this struggle.

Associated Press dispatch from Berlin on the 18th: German and Hungarian troops, who occupied Nikolayev yesterday, reportedly advanced eastward to the lower reaches of the Dnieper River, constantly pursuing and suppressing the Soviet army. Odessa has reportedly been cut off and is being constantly bombed by the German air force. It is reported that the German army is advancing through the fertile land and mining areas between the Bug and Dnieper Rivers, and the retreating Soviet army is gradually retreating. The number of prisoners and war materials has greatly increased.

TASS dispatch from Moscow on the 18th: The Red Army on the western front achieved an important victory yesterday. The Red Army, led by civilian staff Chai Luofu, surrounded and annihilated a battalion each of German infantry, artillery, and motorized units. 730 German officers and soldiers were killed and 103 were captured. Soviet troops also captured several cannons, three anti-aircraft guns, and twelve machine guns.

Associated Press dispatch from Moscow on the 18th: Last night, an air raid alarm was issued in Moscow for four and a half hours due to a German air raid. However, the official communique stated that small groups of German aircraft were scattered outside the city and none were able to penetrate the defense line. Several aircraft were destroyed. The alarm was issued at 11:30 PM. It was reported that on Saturday night, a German aircraft attempted to fly over Moscow, but was shot down.

Havas dispatch from Moscow on the 18th: This morning, the Information Bureau issued a battle report stating, "Fierce fighting occurred in all areas of the front line last night." This is the briefest communique issued by the Information Bureau since the start of the German-Soviet war.

Associated Press dispatch from London on the 18th: Authoritative sources in Britain stated today that the German army seems to have relaunched its attack on Leningrad in the Estonian area. The extent of the German army's advance and the intensity of the offensive are currently unknown.

Britain Believes Loss of Nikolayev Has No Particular Significance

Reuters dispatch from London on the 18th: War critics stated that after the Soviet Union and Germany mobilized millions of troops, thousands of tanks, aircraft, and cannons and fought bloodily for eight weeks, the German army has only now won its first major victory, namely the occupation of the city of Nikolayev on the Black Sea coast. Although this city is not a very large spoil of war and is not as strategically important as Odessa, its loss confirms that the German army has ravaged the southernmost part of Ukraine as far as the mouth of the Dnieper River. However, the port of Odessa is still in Soviet hands, and the German army will inevitably suffer heavy losses if it tries to capture the port by force. In practical terms, the German occupation of Nikolayev can be regarded as a small victory. However, when compared with the previous statements made by the German side, it is not worth mentioning. Four weeks ago, the German radio station broadcast to the world that the Soviet army's resistance had collapsed and the roads to Leningrad, Moscow, and Kiev had indeed been opened, and that the vast majority of the Soviet army had been captured or destroyed. However, the three fronts of Leningrad, Moscow, and Kiev are still intact, and the German army was forced to continue its attack south in order to find a weak point and flank the Soviet defenses. The German advance to the southeast ended with the occupation of Nikolayev. However, the Soviet army led by General Butny in that area was still able to avoid encirclement and retreat into the Dnieper Bay, and the crossing was not met with significant losses or disruption. Well-informed sources in London believe that the loss of Nikolayev has no particular significance. The materials left behind by the Soviet army in that port for the German army to use must be minimal, and all ships have been either sailed away or sunk. The situation on the remaining fronts remains unchanged, but there are signs of renewed fighting north of Leningrad in the areas of Keksholm and Smolensk.

Reuters dispatch from Moscow on the 18th: The general impression in Moscow today is that the German army's major offensive in Ukraine is now gradually stalling due to strong Soviet resistance.

Germany Claims Ukrainian Soviet Army Failed to Take Away Large Amounts of Food

Associated Press dispatch from Vichy on the 18th: German sources here declared yesterday that Germany's offensive into Ukraine and the Dnieper River region has obtained large quantities of food for the Axis countries' warehouse. The main items looted by the Germans were cattle, sheep, pigs, and unharvested and harvested wheat. German sources claimed that these items were not quickly taken away due to the Soviet Union's lack of transportation. They also claimed that large quantities of food were stored along the river, ready to be transported. They further claimed that the German army had five hundred harvesters and countless agricultural experts when entering Ukraine, and immediately harvested wheat several miles behind the front lines. They also said that the retreating Soviet army in Ukraine did not cause destruction, unlike in Poland and the Belarus region.

### Anti-Fascist Surge Spreads Across Europe

Reuters dispatch from Moscow on the 18th: According to Zens News Agency, the great wave of anti-fascist activity is now spreading across Europe. Fierce struggles are currently taking place in Yugoslavia and Croatia. In some places, anti-fascist factions have open conflicts with local garrisons, fascist youth parties, and police. Prisoners in the Travnik concentration camp in Bosnia rebelled, disarmed the guards, and escaped. The authorities immediately sent troops to the camp and opened fire on the prisoners with machine guns, and 42 people were sentenced to death by a military court. In recent days, a large number of people have been executed. In Travnik alone, there have been as many as 100 people. There have also been large numbers of executions in central Serbia. Two anti-fascists in Sarajevo were executed for distributing pamphlets issued by the Moscow Pan-Slavic Conference calling on the Slavic people to attack fascism. Poles are secretly listening to the broadcasts of this conference and appeals with great ingenuity, so they are now widely circulating throughout Poland.

### Exchange of Goods Agreement Signed; Britain to Supply Soviet Union with £10 Million Worth of Goods; US-Soviet Trade Agreement Extended

Reuters dispatch from London on the 18th: The agreement between the Soviet and British governments for the exchange of goods based on credit loans was signed in Moscow on Saturday. The agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union and Britain will provide each other with a large number of goods, and the British government will provide the Soviet Union with a three percent credit loan of £10 million in British gold, with a term of five years.

Taiwan Public News Agency dispatch from Moscow on the 18th: Moscow published yesterday an important resolution of the Supreme Soviet, approving the extension of the British-Soviet commercial agreement to August 6, 1942.

### United States Plans to Select Harriman to Attend Tripartite Conference

Taiwan Public News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 18th: President Roosevelt has returned to his desk in the White House today. He will implement the recent agreement with Britain and the assurances to the Soviet Union to increase American aid. It is believed that the President's first step will focus on the strained US-Japan relations and the need to accelerate the delivery of supplies to the Soviet Union. Some observers believe that the government's announcement that a tanker carrying aviation gasoline has set sail for Vladivostok is intended to test Japan's reaction to the transportation of aid supplies to the Soviet Union via the Pacific. The matters currently awaiting the President's handling are as follows: (1) Japan refuses to allow the US ship President Coolidge to transport American expatriates stranded in Japan; (2) Select a representative to attend the conference on British and American aid to the Soviet Union to be held in Moscow. It is believed that the US representative will be Lend-Lease Coordinator Harriman, stationed in London; (3) Decide whether to take over the Kearny Shipyard, which has been hit by a strike, halting the Navy's shipbuilding program; (4) Plan to accelerate defense production to meet the Soviet Union's new needs, eliminate friction, and centralize management; (5) Request additional funds from Congress to aid democratic countries, estimated to be between US$60 billion and US$120 billion; (6) Sign various important bills, including the bill extending the service period of conscripted National Guard and Reserve troops by 18 months; (7) Review the relationship between the United States and Vichy after Petain announced a closer relationship between France and Germany.

### Hopkins to Manage the Transportation of Military Supplies to the Soviet Union

Washington, 18th (Associated Press) - Reliable sources have revealed that President Roosevelt's pledge to aid the Soviet Union by accelerating the shipment of American military supplies may be managed by Hopkins. However, this aid will not be implemented under the Lend-Lease Act. It is now beyond doubt that the executive branch intends to put into action the promises made in the letter from Roosevelt and Churchill to Stalin. Informed sources say that aircraft, artillery, and other military equipment will be shipped to the Soviet Union as quickly as possible. It is widely believed that the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting's decision to provide greater and faster aid to Britain and the Soviet Union has prompted the United States to reconsider its entire military production program. The British Minister of Supply, Lord Beaverbrook, is currently in Washington providing American officials with a new list of British needs for military equipment and food. With the needs of Britain and the Soviet Union being so vast, the existing production facilities will inevitably need to be expanded further. Government officials suggest that the new Lend-Lease program will require at least one trillion US dollars. It is said that the Army and Navy Departments have been ordered to prepare to provide all available materials to the Soviet military delegation currently in Washington. It is also reported that government officials, given the vastness and resources of the Soviet Union, have not yet considered applying the Lend-Lease Act to the Soviet Union. President Roosevelt is believed to believe that a steady flow of American goods is necessary to encourage Soviet resistance. The President also believes that if the Soviet Union can defeat the German army, the end of the war will come several years earlier than if the Soviet Union were to be defeated. Preparations are reportedly underway to send high-ranking military and supply representatives to Moscow. It is widely believed that individuals with cabinet-level positions may also be sent. The shipment of gasoline, aircraft, and other supplies to the Soviet Union will be handled immediately and will not await the conclusion of this meeting.

### British Prime Minister Churchill Returns Home Safely by Ship, Landed in Iceland on the Way Back, Inspecting British and American Troops

London, 18th (Reuters) - It was officially announced this morning that Prime Minister Churchill and his entourage, after meeting with the US President at sea last week, safely returned to Britain this morning aboard the battleship Prince of Wales. It is reported that Churchill landed in Iceland on his way back and inspected British and American troops.

London, 18th (Reuters) - Details of Prime Minister Churchill's departure from Britain have now been released. It is said that the Prime Minister departed from London by train and boarded a destroyer at a certain British port. Naval personnel and others at the port were sworn to secrecy regarding the Prime Minister's trip and were unaware of his destination. As the destroyer set sail, the Prime Minister stood on the bridge, with a cigar in his mouth, appearing very pleased. After the Prime Minister reached the sea on the destroyer, he transferred to the flagship HMS King George V, met with Admiral Tovey, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, and had lunch. He then transferred to the Prince of Wales and set off on a journey across the Atlantic. It is now known that several destroyers from the Home Fleet also set sail to escort him.

### Partial Changes to the Cabinet of Southern Ireland

Dublin, 18th (Reuters) - It was announced last night that there have been slight changes to the Southern Irish cabinet.

Dublin, 18th (Haitong News Agency) - Following the resignation of the Irish Minister of Public Health, Rutledge, he has been succeeded by McGinty, the former Minister of Industry and Commerce. The post of Minister of Industry and Commerce will be held concurrently by the Minister of Supply, Lemass. Rutledge joined the Irish cabinet as a minister in 1932.

London, 18th (Reuters) - The film of Roosevelt and Churchill's meeting at sea has now been flown to London. A preview was shown to journalists last night, but many important parts were not shown. The first scene showed Churchill's initial meeting with the US President. Churchill boarded the American ship wearing a travel hat and with a cigar in his mouth. Upon seeing the US President, he shook hands in greeting. Churchill's first words were, "Good morning, how are you?" He then handed a letter from the King to the US President. The film also showed the two men sitting in the cabin of the British ship Prince of Wales holding prayers. In addition, there were scenes of 200 American sailors being invited to board the British ship, bringing gifts prepared by the President, such as cigarettes, fruits, and cheese, to distribute to the British sailors, showing mutual friendship. However, the actual meetings were not shown on screen. According to a naval officer who accompanied them, the two men spent most of their time in private talks in the President's office on the deck of the American ship.

### American Writer Hemingway and His Wife Travel Freely on the Mountain Defense Line (Part Two)

Boat Trip on the North River

The military arranged for us a truck, which drove to the Shaoguan Hotel. This car needed two people to drive, a driver and a mechanic. The mechanic's job was to crank the engine, jump off the car when it went downhill, and put wooden blocks behind the rear wheels, and to negotiate with people if there were obstacles in the road. The mechanic had tuberculosis, and his coughing corresponded to the driver's mucus membrane cough. The back of the vehicle was piled with luggage, as well as three accompanying military officers and four guards, all of whom were thin, silent, and wore faded cotton uniforms.

Our guards carried rifles, grenades, box cannons, etc. Although they were only about nineteen years old, they looked eleven or twelve years older. They were all very kind and humble and borrowed our thermos twice to get hot water.

The mud road was light yellow in the foggy and rainy weather. We passed through villages and saw square stone forts, where farmers had taken refuge from bandits, but under bombing, this place was no longer a place to hide. We passed rice fields with gray mud, and barefoot farmers tilled the land behind a bald-haired water buffalo. The trees here were lush, the mountain peaks were sharp, and there were shrubs that blossomed like honeysuckle. After driving for two hours, we had reached a section of the road that was not very smooth. The driver hunched over the steering wheel, suffering from coughing. We used all our strength, holding onto the car window with one hand and bracing ourselves against the roof with the other. The vehicle drove through the mud, with many mud holes on the road. The car jumped, and the shaking was extremely violent. The driver and mechanic coughed, spat, and talked to each other in murmurs.

We drove to the top of a mountain and stopped at the edge of a village. We had traveled thirty-five miles in three hours, and after that, there was no road to be found. A group of people followed the porters carrying luggage to the mud bank. We comfortably boarded the deck of a gasoline boat and sat on the boat hooks and ropes. This boat had to be pumped every two hours to avoid sinking. The hull was extremely rotten and could be broken with a fist. The cabin was dirty and smelly, as expected. This was the only gasoline boat on the North River.

Everyone and everything was on board, and we sailed into the river, towing a civilian boat behind us, twice the size of the gasoline boat. This civilian boat was divided into several sections with bamboo mats. In the boat were our guards, three military officers, and the boat owner's family—two men, two children, two women, and a newborn baby, who cried very loudly. The mother tied the baby to her back to cook, which made the crying a little better.

Many civilian boats with broken brown sails were sailing downstream, and heavily loaded boats sailing upstream were using poles or ropes to pull themselves along. The Chinese method of boating was either to bend over and brace the bamboo pole with their shoulders or to pull the heavy boats with ropes. A line of men, women, and children slowly moved the heavy cargo ship forward with ropes. They sang and shouted as they pulled hard, and the sound waves floated across the water like undulating wails.

Arrival at Destination

There are three waterways leading to this front line where there is no road to choose, and the North River is one of them. The helmsman on the gasoline boat was an old man with sparse white hair, a few yellow teeth, a small black velvet rope hat, and a long tobacco pipe. He sat cross-legged on a high chair next to the steering wheel and grabbed a bowl of white rice with chopsticks and stuffed it into his mouth. Then he sipped a spoonful of soup, breathed a sigh of satisfaction, and spat out a mouthful of phlegm out the window. His little grandson handed him the tobacco pipe. His grandson was a very interesting fellow, also wearing the same velvet rope hat and the same contemplative face. The grandson slept on the smelly toilet at the front and spent most of his time using a pump to pump water out of the boat.

At this time, the rope towing the civilian boat, which was thick enough to tie a package, suddenly broke. It was now four thirty in the afternoon, time for dinner, so the civilian boat used bamboo poles to pull alongside, and we crossed over to that boat, sat on the deck, swished our chopsticks in the boiling water for a while, and began our first meal of the day. At six o'clock, it was dark, the guards had fallen asleep, and the officers were wearing long robes, curled up on the civilian boat's deck. We returned to the fresh air of the deck.

We traveled in the lightless night, and as dawn approached, the steamboat was about to run aground. The helmsman's son stood at the bow, using a boat hook to measure the depth of the water. He sang to the helmsman in a melodic voice: "Two feet, two and a half feet, two feet," reporting slowly, until he encountered the second sandbar. We ran aground five times, and eventually everyone got confused. The civilian boat overtook us and went ahead. The helmsman admitted that there was nothing he could do, so he steered us close to the shore, where there were at least forty civilian boats docked. As we approached, we immediately heard their voices, smelled a breath, and had a lot of mosquitoes. Hemingway found these houseboat dwellers very interesting.

### Stabilization Fund Announces Measures to Manage Shanghai Foreign Exchange Market; Exchange Rates for British and US Currencies Have Been Set at Levels; Applications for Supply Can Be Made for Legitimate Needs

The United States and Britain announced the freezing of Japanese assets. At the same time, at the request of the Chinese government, the freezing of Chinese assets aims to assist the Chinese government, control foreign exchange, manage trade, and extend its powers to Shanghai and other occupied areas to prevent funds from falling into Japanese hands, eliminate foreign exchange speculation, and stabilize the status of the legal tender. However, since the announcement of the freeze order, everything has failed to achieve the expected ideals. The Chinese government authorized the Stabilization Fund to take appropriate steps. The fund, with extreme caution, sent Chang to conduct on-the-spot investigations and thoroughly study the foreign exchange situation in Chongqing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai to determine countermeasures. Recently, due to the mischief of speculators, the Shanghai black market has shrunk sharply, and unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to raise prices, which has greatly threatened people's livelihoods. Dr. Taylor, the assistant of the American member of the Stabilization Fund, Mr. Fox, witnessed this situation in Shanghai and could not allow it to continue. After repeated consultations with the Stabilization Fund, the fund began to implement its stabilization work yesterday. According to reports from the Da Zhong News Agency, importers engaged in legitimate trade are allowed to supply at the level of US$5.3125 and £3 1/5625 pence. Since the announcement of this measure at around 9:00 am yesterday, importers have suddenly obtained more favorable exchange rates for settlement, and people's hearts have been greatly encouraged. Affected by this, the price of gold closed at 6,795 yuan yesterday, a decrease of 453 yuan compared to last week. It is expected that prices will inevitably fall as a result, and speculative behavior will also tend to disappear.

Stabilization Committee Revises Exchange Rates

Before taking this step yesterday, the Stabilization Fund sent a message to the branches of 14 foreign banks in the city, specially approving the supply of foreign exchange according to the new exchange rate. The original text reads: "From August 18, 1941 (ie, Monday), the Stabilization Fund Committee will supply spot US dollars at an exchange rate of 5.34375 yuan to banks approved under Notes 59 and 61 of the US Treasury Department to engage in legitimate import trade with China. The settlement and sale of this foreign exchange must be in accordance with the provisions of General Note 58 of the United States.

Detailed Regulations for Application

If the above-mentioned banks need to replenish the foreign exchange sold, the Hong Kong office or agency of each bank should submit an application to the temporary office of the fund at Nos. 104, 105, and 106, HSBC Building, Hong Kong, and submit a document containing the following conditions: This bank or agency, on behalf of the applicant, hereby undertakes to provide your committee with three copies of the application form signed by Andang within two weeks. If your committee subsequently discovers that the settled foreign exchange is used for various import businesses not specified in the first paragraph, or for the import of goods listed in the embargo regulations promulgated by the Chinese Customs Authority on July 4, 1939, and subsequently revised and added, we also agree to sell the settled foreign exchange again. The replenishment of US dollar sales can be handled by the applicant's branch or agency in Hong Kong. If we receive notification from your committee stating that the amount applied for has been prepared, this branch or agency will immediately issue a certificate to your committee in the usual verified manner, stating that the equivalent amount of legal tender has been..." The message has been sent to the Shanghai offices of Citibank and Chase Bank.

Market Morale Greatly Encouraged

According to the above announcement, it is only known that the Stabilization Fund has stipulated that the US dollar exchange rate for importers engaged in legitimate trade is 5.34375 yuan. However, the level set for the British pound exchange rate has not been stated in writing. However, according to reports from Da Zhong News Agency, the Stabilization Fund has also stipulated that the British pound exchange rate is 3 1/5625 pence at the same time. This was told by a senior staff member of Mercantile Bank and should not be regarded as a false rumor. It is said that the purpose of this move by the Stabilization Fund is to stabilize the foreign exchange market, consolidate the status of the legal tender, and maintain the import of essential goods in the city according to this official standard. However, it does not provide for speculative transactions and restricts them from engaging in trade with Japanese merchants in the city or the Japanese headquarters according to this new exchange rate. In the past few weeks, the market's required positions have been mainly importers engaged in legitimate business. However, due to speculators vying for purchases and Japanese banks secretly covering short positions, the British and American exchange rates have shrunk sharply, and there have been losses. Today, after the Stabilization Fund announced the official US dollar standard, they were suddenly able to settle foreign exchange at a more favorable exchange rate. As a result, the morale of the entire market has been greatly encouraged. (According to the new exchange rate, one US dollar is equivalent to 18.82 yuan in legal tender.)

Supply of Foreign Exchange Limited to Essential Goods

The Stabilization Fund Committee's announcement yesterday did not mention the goods for which foreign exchange should be settled. We must limit ourselves to non-luxury goods. However, according to the Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods During Extraordinary Times announced by the Ministry of Finance on July 1, 1939, the customs tariff numbers for 18 groups and 234 tax rules are listed, such as foreign wine, canned fruits, vegetables, and luxury wool goods, cotton goods, wood, paper, bamboo, rattan ware, stone products, and liquid fuels with available substitutes are all prohibited from import and transshipment, or import via parcel post from overseas. The Shanghai Customs has not complied due to the special environment. However, if the above-mentioned prohibited goods are imported by Shanghai Customs in the future, the supply of foreign exchange will be suspended. In other words, foreign exchange can be applied for for imported goods, but only for essential goods. Speculators who pretend to be importers will be strictly rejected.

### Recruitment of Accounting Households; Overwhelming Response

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's Department of Industry and Social Affairs began recruiting accounting households to prepare a cost-of-living index for salaried classes, applicants have been flocking to apply, and the demand for accounting ledgers shows that members of society are deeply interested in this statistic. It is reported that after the department receives the application notices, it must go through procedures such as numbering. The ledgers and accounting instructions will be mailed to each family individually by the end of September to start accounting on October 1st. The recruitment period is very short and will end on September 5th. Applicants should send a letter to the Department of Industry and Social Affairs, Jiangxi Road, as soon as possible, so as not to miss the opportunity.

### Coal Ball Costs are Limited; Price Increases Should Be Prevented; Disputes Among Coal Ball Companies Occur Frequently; Sales Prices Vary; Users Suffer

Coal ball prices have been particularly chaotic in recent days. The French Concession authorities assessed a price of 16 yuan per dan (unit of weight) in the previous week. After being broken by six jiao (1/10 of a yuan) recently, there are rumors that the price will increase by another 12 yuan per ton and 6 jiao per dan starting today. Residents of the city deeply hope that the authorities of both concessions, for the sake of the welfare of the people, should pay close attention and prevent this trend.

Large Factories Withdraw from the Association Without Legal Basis

The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association held an executive supervisory meeting at its meeting place on Tianjin Road at 4:00 pm yesterday to discuss various issues. Those present were Chen Cuifang, Mao Chunpu, and all executive supervisory committee members. Chairman Chen Cuifang then discussed: (1) The case of seven coal ball factories, including Yitaixing, withdrawing from the association. It was resolved that there was no legal basis for this and that it was difficult to approve. They were asked to maintain the association and pay the arrears. (2) A statement was published in the newspaper stating the association's position and requesting that every effort be made to supply the association's small factories with raw materials so that production could be increased and prices would not be raised due to panic. (3) The two concession authorities were requested to be notified by the association's official letter of the wholesale price of coal balls from each factory in the future and not to raise prices without authorization. (4) The holding of flat-price coal balls was resolved to be discussed after the disputes between the factories were resolved. (5) Meetings will be convened once every two weeks, and temporary meetings may be convened when necessary.

Manufacturing Costs of Large and Small Coal Ball Factories

In order to make it clear to the outside world the manufacturing costs of coal balls for large and small coal ball factories, the Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association estimated the manufacturing costs of coal balls for each factory yesterday as follows: Water feet vary, 13 yuan, mine price, 2 yuan, total 15 yuan (US dollars), equivalent to 285 yuan in national currency, plus outside expenses of 20 yuan in national currency, which is 305 yuan. Ordinary coal balls use 70% Hongji coal fines, valued at 213.5 yuan, and 30% Hailing fines, valued at 51 yuan, totaling 264.5 yuan in national currency. Calculated at a discount of 96%, it only equals 253.5 yuan in national currency, plus a yellow mud fee of 2.5 yuan, which is 256 yuan. Plus manufacturing costs: (1) Those who have a contract with the Kailuan Mining Bureau pay only 15 yuan per ton for manufacturing costs, for a total cost of 281 yuan per ton. (2) Those who do not have a contract with the Kailuan Mining Bureau (small factories) pay 45 yuan per ton for manufacturing costs, for a total cost of 301 yuan per ton. However, based on yesterday's exchange rate, this number is not needed.

### A Glimpse of Japan's Attitude Towards the Thai Issue

Tokyo, 13th (Special Cable from Whitene, Japan Correspondent for the North China Daily News) - It is claimed that a senior official of the Japanese government once told him that Japan's attitude towards Southeast Asia can be symbolized by the joint defense agreement signed with French Indochina. The so-called defense will continue to be maintained unless Japan is forced to choose another attitude. It was also stated that if British Foreign Secretary Eden had stated that Thailand had a deep interest in British affairs, Japan also recognizes that Thailand's position is equally important to Japan and will not allow various schemes to make Thailand a pawn against Japan. Japan's intention in Southeast Asia is entirely peaceful, except for planning a final battle with Chongqing. However, it continued to say that Japan could not ignore Britain's recent provocative military preparations, as these preparations began long before Japan signed the joint defense agreement with Vietnam.

### Affected by the International Situation, Some Japanese Merchants Suspend Business; A Total of 53 Cases Last Month, But Waitresses and Geishas Are Still Flourishing

Recently, many small and medium-sized Japanese merchants in Shanghai have mostly become partners of large capital operators and employees of salaried classes. Those who remain have also voluntarily suspended business due to operational difficulties. According to statistics from the Japanese Consulate Police Department, a total of 53 businesses were suspended in July, including cafes, tea shops, restaurants, grocery stores, trading companies, etc. As for female occupations, such as waitresses and geishas, they are still flourishing. Currently, Japanese shops in Hongkou have reached an important fork in the road, and all parties are discussing countermeasures. It is said that the Economic Department of the Japanese Consulate Police Department is actively eliminating bad businesses and cracking down on unscrupulous merchants.

### General Joffre Steamer Sails North from Saigon; Japanese Expatriates Withdraw from Shanghai in Southeast Asia; US-French Relations Have Not Reached the Brink of Rupture; French Steamer Still Sails to Manila Port

With the tense situation in the Pacific, there is talk of Japanese expatriates in Southeast Asia starting to withdraw. According to foreign merchants and shipping circles, a small number of Japanese expatriates have indeed set off to return to their country. It is reported that the French company's General Joffre steamer is coming to Shanghai from Saigon, and after these Japanese expatriates arrive in Shanghai, whether they will transfer to a ship to return to their country or stay in the city has not been confirmed. The General Joffre steamer also brought 5,000 bags of Saigon rice to Shanghai, and the ship is berthed at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf. The previous rumor that the General Joffre Road was detained by the Dutch East Indies authorities has been proven to be untrue. Before US-French relations completely break down, French postal vessels will not stop at Manila port.

### American Missionary in Huai'an Detained: Japanese Claim Leakage of Military Intelligence, Shanghai American Presbyterian Church Does Not Believe It; Japanese Deny Rumors of Wells' Murder

The "China Press" reports that, according to Tong Meng News Agency, the Japanese Army Information Bureau in Shanghai yesterday afternoon (17th) firmly denied the news that an American female missionary was strangled to death by the Japanese army in Huai'an, northern Jiangsu. They claimed that the Japanese Army authorities here, after receiving a detailed report from the commander of the Japanese troops fighting in the Huai'an area, stated that the rumors of a beautiful female missionary being strangled to death or other American missionaries being detained were

Absolutely Untrue

According to official information from Huai'an, when the Japanese army was fighting the New Fourth Army in that area, they suspected that military intelligence of value was being transmitted through the American Presbyterian Church in Huai'an. Therefore, on July 31st, the Japanese army dispatched a lieutenant colonel to begin an investigation. They discovered that the church's hospital was being used by the New Fourth Army at will to collect intelligence on Japanese military operations. They also learned that 19 wounded soldiers of the New Fourth Army being treated in the hospital, except for three, had left before the Japanese army captured the city. Furthermore, they discovered that among the hospital staff was the daughter of a certain New Fourth Army officer who was constantly

Supplying Information

to the Chinese army. After the Japanese lieutenant colonel completed his investigation, he met with a representative of the American Presbyterian Church in Huai'an on August 14th. The representative then handed a letter to the Japanese army, acknowledging the points raised by the Japanese and apologizing on behalf of the church. The Japanese Army authorities warned them not to repeat such incidents, and the matter was dropped. Last night, members of the American Presbyterian Church in Shanghai stated that they did not believe the Japanese claims that the church's staff in Huai'an were supplying military intelligence to the Chinese army. There was only one female staff member in the Huai'an church, and the recent rumors of her being harmed were not true, but the woman had been

Confined to Her Home

by the military. People from Shanghai recently went to Huai'an to meet with the woman and have since returned to Shanghai. The Japanese reported to the American Consul General in Shanghai yesterday that the staff of the American Church in Qingjiangpu, northern Jiangsu, had been released on Saturday. The American consulate then informed the American Church in Shanghai that the staff of the Jiangpu American Church had been detained since July 31st and were not allowed to meet with any outsiders and had insufficient food. The Japanese army also posted notices in front of the hospital where these missionaries served, stating that the Japanese army was closing the hospital as retaliation for American policies. The English-language "China Press" also reported that eight American missionaries and one child from the American Presbyterian Church in Qingjiangpu were confined by the Japanese army on the upper floor of a house for

Sixteen Days

and were reportedly released and were relatively free. However, the American Presbyterian Church in Shanghai had not yet received confirmation of the release of these missionaries. The news of the release was only the notification from the American consulate after receiving a report from the Japanese authorities yesterday. It was also heard that Ms. Wells, the beautiful female missionary in Huai'an, was still safe and sound and was only confined to her home. The previous rumors that she had been strangled to death were inaccurate, but it was still unknown whether Ms. Wells was still under detention.

### Children Without Fathers: Living on Pensions - Ten Interviews for Scholarship Assistance

The young man surnamed Chen is already ten years old and will only be in the first year of high school next semester. He dropped out of school for a considerable period to escape the war. His father, who worked at the National Bank of Nanjing, unfortunately passed away after the war. His mother received a pension of 5,000 yuan. His mother, maternal grandparents, and two younger brothers and sisters barely survive on this pension. The money will be used up in a few years. Now, a manager of a local bank, a good friend of his father during his lifetime, is helping him. The situation is quite tragic.

A Miss Shui's father was an employee of a certain bank's Zhejiang branch and unfortunately passed away three years ago. He left behind six or seven children. Now they rely on a monthly pension of 100 yuan (minus 4 yuan for income tax) from the bank to maintain their lives. This Miss Shui is now a senior in the kindergarten normal school. The school waived her tuition fee of 20 yuan in the first half of the year. One younger brother is in a vocational school, and another is in elementary school. The difficulty of their lives can be imagined.

Pitiable Children

The thirteen-year-old child surnamed Qiao was in the first year of junior high school at Zhaoguang Middle School last school year. During the summer, he was admitted to the Civil Engineering Department of the second year of junior high school at the China Vocational School. Although the application form stated that there were three people in the family, mother and son, in fact, his older brother was far away in Chongqing, working as an electrical technician, which was only enough to maintain his personal life. He and his mother lived in the stairwell of a relative's house, which was dark and sunless. He couldn't help but cry when he told his story. His grades were not satisfactory because he couldn't study in the stairwell, and he had to work for others after school, so he had very little opportunity to study on his own. If this poor child is not helped, he will not have the opportunity to acquire better living knowledge and skills.

A seventeen-year-old child, you cannot see anything special about him on his application form, only that his relationship with his parent or guardian is uncle-nephew. It turns out that he is an orphan. His parents passed away a long time ago, and four brothers also died one after another. This is truly a tragic event! He now relies on his uncle for a living. His uncle works as a receptionist in a private hospital. It is certainly difficult for this kind of occupation's salary to support his nephew's tuition. This child is now in the second year of vocational high school in the mechanical engineering department. Studying specialized technology is the most suitable for him in terms of survival. (T)

Diligent Female Student

A female student in the high school department, she has excellent grades, but she does not relax because of her good grades, but continues to study diligently. When I went to visit, she was in the living room working on her summer homework, which further confirmed that her usual excellent grades were not accidental. She was originally a boarding student, and her family lived in her hometown. Because it was summer vacation, she temporarily lived in the home of a fairly wealthy relative, accompanying the two children in the relative's home to tutor them in summer studies.

She wore simple clothes. She had a modest attitude and spoke elegantly. She had a ten-minute conversation with me. During the conversation, I learned about her family's situation: she was originally an "only daughter" without brothers or sisters, and her family had lived in the countryside of Guo County for generations. They had more than ten acres of land and several rural houses. Her father was able to manage the family diligently and frugally, so they could be considered a well-off family before the war. Since the outbreak of the war, her hometown was occupied, the area was not peaceful, and the family's economy was severely hit. She could not stand the false alarms, panic, and the blow of being out of school, so she fled to Shanghai alone to study, boarding at the school. On holidays, she occasionally lived in the home of a relatively close relative. However, the cost of her studying in Shanghai was a major expense, but she was unwilling to drop out of school and did not want to add to the worries of her elderly parents. She could not live in her relative's house permanently, so she decided to apply to this newspaper for part of the tuition. Finally, I asked her if that relative could help, but she did not answer and showed an embarrassed expression.

I obtained the above results and wrote a report truthfully. As for whether to give assistance to that young woman who is not poor but very studious, that is beyond my responsibility. (C)

### Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund: Committee to Meet Today; Review of Scholarship Quota for College and Middle School Students; Application Deadline for Free Quota at Four Middle Schools is This Afternoon

The investigation of applicants for the two groups of the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund, college and middle school students, has been completed long ago. The review team carefully studied it yesterday based on the investigation report. It has also been finalized after three hours and submitted to the committee for final review and decision at 4 pm today. It will be announced successively from tomorrow. I hope all applicants will pay special attention. As for the free places specially set up by this newspaper for Yu Hua, Jing Zhi, Zheng Zhong, and Xin Jian four middle schools, the number of applicants was extremely enthusiastic until yesterday. The registration will be closed at noon today, and there will be no further accommodations for latecomers. Yesterday, Tongde Middle School sent a letter to set up a free place for this newspaper, and their enthusiasm is commendable, but this newspaper believes that the scholarship work for this semester is coming to an end, and it is planned to handle it next semester.

Enthusiastic People Show Old-Fashioned Generosity

Yesterday, donations reached more than a thousand yuan. Among them, there are three good intentions that can be described: (1) Mr. Mao Aitang of Dasheng Silk Village wrote in a letter, "Every time I read newspapers and periodicals, they carry the righteous deeds of scholarship funds, loan funds, etc. Although the methods are different, the main purpose is to benefit children from poor families. They are truly different paths to the same goal. I privately admire the good measures of the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund. It is the height of summer, and it is the 50th birthday of Mrs. Shen, the mother of the late King. I have the honor to be half a son, so I have proposed to raise a glass to wish her a long life. However, the birthday mother has always been kind and compassionate. In view of the national crisis and the people's suffering, she resolutely rejected all unnecessary extravagance and wished to do things that would benefit the people. I obeyed my mother's instructions and responded to my heart, so I transferred my personal birthday gift of 500 yuan to the Jinbao Readers' Scholarship Fund to inspire outstanding students from poor families and to create happiness for my birthday mother." (2) In addition to Mr. Shen Baoqi's generous donation of 200 yuan, Wang Yueming of Yihua Foreign Company's import department, his daughter, little sister Wang Ronghua, is one year old, and her relatives and friends gave her many gifts. Mr. Wang did not dare to spend too much because the world is in turmoil, so he specially saved 200 yuan for the scholarship fund and named it "Wang Ronghua's First Birthday Commemoration." (3) On the anniversary of "August 13th", Mr. Cao Zhiyu of Lixin Hardware Store on Zhejiang Road explained the meaning of the Shenbao Scholarship Fund to colleagues in the hardware and iron trade contact office in Tongle Garden Teahouse on Xiamen Road, and then donated 30 yuan himself and raised 120 yuan. The enthusiasm of people from all walks of life to help students is admirable.

Donations Were Very Enthusiastic Yesterday

The titles of the gentlemen who donated yesterday are recorded as follows: Mr. Mao Aitang's birthday gift to Mrs. Shen, mother of the late King, 500 yuan, Mr. Shen Baoqi 200 yuan, Wang Ronghua's first birthday commemoration 200 yuan, Lichang Company colleagues 50 yuan, Lixin Hardware Store Cao Zhiyu 30 yuan, Cao raised 120 yuan from his colleagues (including Li Rujin 30 yuan, Zhang Yisheng 30 yuan, Shi Jiuxiang 10 yuan, Zhang Mingshui 5 yuan, Qian Genchun 5 yuan, Zhu Ruichu 5 yuan, Wu Caizhang 5 yuan, Yang Yuchun 5 yuan, Chen Xianshun 5 yuan, Tang Xingsheng 5 yuan, Wu Hanqing 5 yuan, Luo Maoliang 5 yuan, Lou Yunzhou 5 yuan), Zhuan Jiaowan 16 yuan, Xi Nan (manuscript fee) 9 yuan, anonymous 2 yuan and 1 jiao, Tang Youmei (manuscript fee) 1 yuan, the above totals 1,128 yuan and 1 jiao, previous balance 51,729 yuan, 4 jiao and 1 fen, total 52,857 yuan, 5 jiao and 1 fen

### American Court to Appoint Temporary Commissioner to Try the Tedelpon Case

The English-language "China Press" reports that Tedelpon, the former executive officer of the U.S. Court in Shanghai, was arrested nine days ago for the crime of stealing public property and was imprisoned in the Ward Road Western Prison because he could not afford the bail of US$5,000. Currently, U.S. Commissioner Helmick is on a trip to the United States and has not yet returned to Shanghai. Therefore, Court Prosecutor Hiltz has commissioned lawyer Nelson or Commissioner Ruden of the American Consulate as temporary commissioner to try Tedelpon. It is currently awaiting approval from President Roosevelt and the consent of Commissioner Helmick. According to Hiltz, President Roosevelt has just returned to the White House after meeting with British Prime Minister Churchill at sea, so the appointment of the temporary commissioner is expected to receive President Roosevelt's reply in three days. If approved, the trial can be opened, but the date of the trial cannot be predicted. Tedelpon requested the court to appoint a lawyer to defend him, but the court consulted with many lawyers in the city, and none of them agreed to take on the case. The court will appoint another lawyer to defend Tedelpon when preparing for the formal trial.

### Buying Vegetables Leads to Death by Beating

Zhang Liangdi, a local resident, 47 years old, lived at 22 Hejiajiao, West Shanghai. Yesterday at 6:30 am, Zhang Liangdi and his wife, Ms. Wang, went out to buy vegetables. A dispute arose with Xu Deyuan over a discrepancy in the wholesale price. The dispute escalated into a physical confrontation. Zhang Liangdi and his wife, Ms. Wang, were outnumbered.

Yulong Store at 1559 Jiaozhou Road, West Shanghai, was suddenly broken into by several robbers at 10:45 pm last night. They threatened with guns and robbed more than 200 yuan in legal tender before fleeing outside with the loot. Wang Yurui, the owner of the store, 29 years old, from Shaoxing, pursued them, shouting for help. The robbers immediately pulled out their guns and opened fire, hitting Wang in the right chest. The bullet did not penetrate. He fell to the ground injured. The robbers escaped into the darkness without a trace. Wang Yurui was taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. It is reported that he was seriously injured and his life was in danger.

### Robbers on North Sichuan Road Last Night Open Fire with Japanese Troops, Resulting in the Arrest of Seven Robbers

The English-language "China Press" reports that seven armed robbers in the Hongkou district last night (17th) planned to rob a Japanese shop on Bazilu Road near North Sichuan Road and were captured by the Japanese Naval Authorities and the Military Police. They are still in detention. It is reported that the Japanese authorities

Received a Tip-Off in Advance

and were prepared at the scene. After a while, seven robbers arrived in a car and broke into the Japanese shop. The Japanese Navy and Military Police immediately surrounded them. The robbers, realizing that the situation was hopeless, opened fire. The Japanese soldiers returned fire. More than fifteen shots were exchanged. The robbers were eventually captured. Bridges over the Suzhou River were blocked at the time. It was rumored that a Chinese man was stabbed with a bayonet during the arrest, but this was reportedly untrue. Another report states that at 8:20 pm last night (17th),

During a Heavy Rain

seven men carrying weapons were riding in rickshaws when they were encountered by a Japanese Marine patrol on Bazilu Road. The patrol attempted to search them, but the men got out of the rickshaws and fled towards Hesketh Road. The Japanese soldiers pursued them, and the men fired at the Japanese soldiers while fleeing. The Japanese soldiers also opened fire. The sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls. Nearby residents were

Shocked and Fearful

As a result, the Japanese soldiers chased and captured four people in front of the China Iron Club, two people at the entrance of Anqing Lane, and one person at the corner of Anfu Lane. Two pistols were confiscated and taken to the Japanese military headquarters. According to the Japanese Continental News yesterday, the arrested men were planning to attack a Taiwanese businessman at 2 Anqing Lane, Bazilu Road.

### Christian Orphanage Expands Capacity: Children Sheltered by the Bao Ke are Now Being Sent to the Orphanage

The Christian Orphanage, located on Columbia Road, was originally run by American church members, with Mrs. Maine as the person in charge. It currently houses 50 children and occupies several acres of land with many self-built houses. Since the intensification of the international situation, American expatriates in Shanghai have been withdrawing one after another. The orphanage is now run by a board of directors organized by Chinese church members. The current people in charge are Chairman Li Baiqiang, Vice Chairman Huang Lanyu, Secretary Xu Shaoshan, Accountant Gao Junzhe, Inspectors Jiang Lisheng and Lin Yuqiong. A manager is also hired to reside in the orphanage and be responsible for management. Currently, the orphanage's children are provided with rice and wheat by the American Red Cross. In addition to the church's allocation, the monthly expenses are raised by the directors. Because a large number of orphans and refugees are being sent from all sides, such as the poor children sheltered by the Public Works Department's Child Protection Section, who are now also being sent to the orphanage, the dormitory space is becoming crowded. There are recent plans to raise funds for additional construction to expand capacity and benefit the children. If anyone has any suggestions or would like to send refugee children, please contact Li Baiqiang at 117B, Securities Building, 422 Hankou Road at any time.

Recently, due to traffic obstruction in various places and the customs and Japanese restrictions on the transportation of machinery and goods to the interior, the business has suffered a major blow. Therefore, it was decided to close down. This was suddenly implemented on the 11th of this month, but the issue of the workers' welfare was ignored. On the 10th, all the workers went to the factory to petition the factory manager, requesting to continue operations in order to maintain the workers' livelihood, or to pay severance pay for dismissal in order to seek other employment. However, the company made no specific statement on this. The workers had no choice but to request again the next day, but they still did not get results. After a full assembly, the workers elected Ji Ziqing, Wang Ailai, Yang Liangchen, Li Guanglin, and Zhang Jiantang as general representatives, responsible for negotiating with the factory, and decided to start a hunger strike today to urge the factory to realize the situation. At the same time, they appealed to all sectors for sympathy and assistance.

### Yang Weiquan's Book News

Yang Weiquan, a famous painter from ancient Fujian, is a veteran modern Chinese painter. His masterpiece, "Ashes of Brocade," melts all things into one furnace, showing different colors and unique features, exquisite and unparalleled, forming its own mechanism. Since Qian Shunju of the Yuan Dynasty spread the "Ashes of Brocade," there are almost no comparable works in the modern world. Chinese and foreign people who obtain even a small piece of his work regard it as a treasure. Recently, due to old age and illness, he only limits himself to making one fan painting per day and one scroll painting per ten days. It is said that this spring there is a new rule of doubling the price, probably to slightly reduce the amount of painting in the midst of endless requests. However, those who seek his work still come endlessly. Therefore, he has newly established a limit on the number of pieces accepted, in order of arrival, without accepting any that require immediate completion, hoping to be understood. He also plans to increase the price again during the Mid-Autumn Festival of the old lunar calendar.

### Finance: It Was Truly Unexpected for Speculation: A Bolt from the Blue in the Foreign Exchange Market: The HSBC Listing Suddenly Saw a Sharp Increase, But It Lacked Momentum and the Dark Market Even Loosened by Eighteen Notches: Anglo-American Re-emerged, Exceeding the Three-Office and Five-Yuan Thresholds

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: At 9:30 a.m. HSBC, because the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee had notified the British HSBC, McGarrett, and Youli, the American Citibank Datong, and the four banks of Zhongzhong Jiaonong to earnestly cooperate in stabilizing the black market exchange rate and provide foreign exchange as much as possible for the legitimate needs of various industries, the listing suddenly rose unexpectedly. The British exchange rose by 18125, equivalent to three offices and 15625, and the US exchange rose by half a yuan, equivalent to five yuan 3125. There was no market for French, German, and Japanese currencies, and the remaining exchanges also rose in unison, causing the dark market for Anglo-American exchanges to also show a surprising loosening trend. Speculative bulls were stunned and found it difficult to find opponents for selling. The US dollar went from four yuan seventy-five and hardened to five yuan eighteen seventy-five, and the British gold went to three offices and zero six twenty-five (both non-official market prices). Legitimate importers were able to settle the US dollar at five yuan thirty-one twenty-five, which is an increase of eighteen notches, and both British and American banks provided it. However, the black market settlement was only five yuan, and it was difficult to obtain British gold at three offices. In the afternoon, speculators still had no inflow or outflow, and foreign firms' settlement was also minimal. Ultimately, the two factions had a huge squeeze and the transaction was not strong.

Bulls Were Stunned

Since the morning, there was no market for British and American silver in foreign telegrams, the spot price of Indian silver was flat, the futures price fell, and the exchange rate of Yinghua against Shanghai in various countries narrowed by 03125, the US dollar against Shanghai narrowed by three points, and the rest were flat. The central listing price of each exchange remained the same. The opening price of the interbank market in the early morning was the selling price of spot British gold at two offices and eight four three seven five, and the US dollar at four yuan seventy-five, which was flat for the British and tight for the US by zero three one two five compared to Saturday's afternoon closing. After the opening, speculators once again bought in according to the previous uptrend, and importing firms also purchased for settlement. Before the 9:30 a.m. HSBC listing, there was an unexpected and sudden increase, and small counters also increased the US exchange to five yuan thirty-one twenty-five, a bolt from the blue, starting a cheap sale. At the same time, HSBC and American banks moderately supplied the US exchange at five yuan thirty-one twenty-five for legitimate commercial settlements. Speculators and new bulls were stunned. The loosest black market price was British gold at three offices and zero six twenty-five, and the US dollar rose to five yuan eighteen seventy-five, but both were quoted prices in the chaos. At noon closing, British gold was two offices and nine six eight seven five, and the US exchange was lacking momentum and could be settled at five yuan. The buying price of banks must be five yuan thirty-one twenty-five.

Importers' Willingness to Negotiate

In the afternoon, speculators still had no supply or demand, and importers' willingness to settle was also weak. HSBC still supplied and sold the US exchange at five yuan thirty-one twenty-five to legitimate commercial foreign firms. Youli McGarrett Datong had a worse intention to supply. At the 3:30 p.m. closing, the spot price to the September futures price was British exchange at three offices and zero one five six two five, and the US dollar at five yuan zero three one two five, which was up one seven one eight seven five for the British and fifteen for the US compared to Saturday's noon closing.

### The Gold Market Suffers an Unprecedented Change: Bills Dramatically Loosen...Bulls Suffer a Huge Blow: There is Supply but No Demand...Futures Fall More Severely than Spot Prices

Yesterday, in the volatile dark market for gold, a huge change occurred suddenly in the futures gold market, with a sharp and tragic drop in price. Prices have fallen below the 7,000 yuan mark, and all parties are unusually frightened. The HSBC listing of foreign exchange suddenly jumped, and the black market followed suit, greatly easing. The bulls were panic-stricken. In the chaotic situation of abundant supply and no demand at Cheng Ji, Yi Da, Xinfeng Yong, Heng Ji, and Xiang Xing Yong, the price plummeted from 7,265 yuan to a low of 6,750 yuan. After 10:30 a.m., it was heard that the black market US exchange was settling at only five yuan, and the Shanghai West gang took advantage of the low price to make up for the losses, and the price recovered by 150 yuan. However, people's hearts were already panicked, and the price was difficult to sustain for a long time. In the afternoon, gold dealers sold bills of exchange to offset the US dollar bulls, pushing the price down to around 6,800 yuan. Ultimately, there was a sharp drop of 453 yuan. It is said that since the release of the foreign exchange freeze order, the long and short sides of the gold market have been fiercely contested. After a certain giant bull suffered an unexpected blow last Saturday, yesterday's father had to release a huge amount of bull chips due to the easing of foreign exchange. The shorts can finally take a breather, and it is said that they have leveled a lot yesterday. The total transaction was more than 100,000 taels. Because the gold price has been raised by more than 200 yuan according to the HSBC small counter US exchange, the swap (August to September) was posted by the bulls Yi Da Xiang He to the shorts Tong Kang Yong for 100 yuan to 120 yuan, with more than 1,000 taels traded. The cash price also fell sharply. Xin Yuan sold 120 taels to Xiang He at a price of 8,920 yuan, which retreated to 8,850 yuan at noon and 8,800 yuan in the afternoon. There was a supply but no demand, with a small squeeze of 190 yuan. The price of gold jewelry was also 10 yuan lower, calculated at 910 yuan.

Futures Fall 453 Yuan

Since the morning, each tael (10 taels) opened at 7,260 yuan at 9:15 a.m., which was 12 yuan higher than the closing price on Saturday afternoon. Next, it saw 7,265 yuan. When the amount of gold pouring from Jin Hao Cheng Ji was huge, the market price was suppressed. When the HSBC listing of foreign exchange was suddenly eased and the black market also eased dramatically, buyers in the market disappeared. In the astonishing selling trend of Xiang Xing Yong, Heng Ji, Xinfeng Yong, Dingsheng, Meifeng, Yi Da, and Xiang He, the market price fell sharply. In the sparse transaction volume, the price fell by a total of 465 yuan, retreating to the 6,800 yuan mark. Sometimes Xiang Xing Yong entered again, and Tian Yuan and Li Tai also bought, and the market situation was raised to 7,008 yuan in chaos. Later, it was heard that commercial import foreign firms had settled at 5 yuan 3125 for the US dollar, and the selling trend rose again. In the selling trend of Heng Ji, Tian Yuan, Cheng Ji, He Sheng and various households, it fell by more than 250 yuan again, dropping to 6,750 yuan. This was strongly bought by Xinfeng Yong, Yi Feng, and Yi Yuan. Scattered shorts took profits to cover their positions, and they immediately hoarded up to 6,900 yuan. Defu, Tian Yuan, Yong An, and others sold a small amount of 100 yuan again, to 6,800 yuan. At noon closing, 6,840 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 p.m. and fell by 40 yuan in the selling trend, calculated at 6,800 yuan. Later, it fell to 6,780 yuan again. Xiang Xing Yong, Yi Yuan, and Xin Feng Yong entered vigorously, and the price suddenly soared by 80 yuan, reaching 6,860 yuan. It was heard that banks were supplying and selling the US dollar at 5 yuan 03125, and Cheng Ji sold more than 10,000 taels, and Yi Da, Da Feng, and Gong He sold vigorously, and the price gradually fell by 100 yuan, retreating to 6,760 yuan. This was strongly bought by Xiang He, and it immediately saw a rise to 6,830 yuan, and then fell again. At the 3:30 p.m. closing, the price was 6,795 yuan, a sharp drop of 453 yuan compared to the noon closing price on Saturday. According to the September US dollar settlement price of 5 yuan 03125, the 6,921 yuan was calculated to be pressed by 126 yuan. According to the small counter US exchange settlement price, it has created a 240 yuan premium. After the closing, 6,800 yuan, there was a difference of 515 yuan on the same day. Jin Hao's own brand gold, the retail price at the store was 8,850 yuan, with a 200 yuan deduction for purchases. There was no price and no market for the current standard gold.

Jewelry Gold and Silver Show Different Trends

The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael at Da Tong Heng and Xin Tong Heng at noon was 10 yuan, calculated at 910 yuan, with a 40 yuan deduction for purchases. The price of silver rose by five cents, and the exchange price was eight yuan and five corners per tael.

### Foreign Currencies All Plunge Sharply

Yesterday's foreign currency market was volatile, and the market price fell sharply, causing the British and American gold pounds to also fall by 10 yuan. The British gold ticket also fell by 3 yuan. The US dollar ticket opened at 2,093 yuan. After the opening, Xiang Yuan Yong and others purchased it, raising it to 96 yuan. Zhi Cheng, United Xie Feng, and others sold it, retreating to 1,950 yuan. Tong Xing, Ren Tai Yong, Da Lai, and others bought it again, raising it to 95 yuan. At noon closing, it retreated to 1,969 yuan again. The market opened at 72 yuan in the afternoon. After the opening, Da Gong, United, Dong Sheng Heng, and others sold it, retreating to 55 yuan. Da Gong transferred to buy, and retail investors followed, raising it to 75 yuan. Tong Yi sold it, retreating to 50 yuan. The evening closing was 1,960 yuan, a drop of 118 yuan compared to last week. The transaction volume was 2 million yuan. The spot price also retreated to 20 yuan and five corners. The trend of the Hong Kong ticket was weak, and the market price fell by three corners. The Japanese gold ticket and the Korean ticket also tended to fall. The former retreated to 2 yuan, 3 corners, and 9 points, and the latter fell to 1 yuan, 8 corners, and 9 points. In addition, such as Singapore, Robbie, Canada, Philippine tickets, etc., all tended to fall.

### Gauze Flower: Gold Market Storm Affects Gauze Market Severely; Fluctuations of Two Horses Amount to a Huge Sum of One Hundred Yuan

The ups and downs of the gauze market are like a wild storm, with a difference of nearly a hundred yuan between rises and falls. Today, the exchange officially opened, and the business market was moved to the second floor. The opening was enthusiastically promoted, pushing it upwards, reaching a new peak of 1,700 yuan, specifically 1,708 yuan. At this time, speculators took profits cautiously, but as the saying goes, things will revert after reaching their extreme. After the foreign exchange rate narrowed, it suddenly surged. It was reported that HSBC's quotation reached 5.3125 yuan, and in an instant, the price of gold plummeted by three hundred yuan. Speculators suffered a great blow, like a bolt from the blue. In an instant, they switched from buying to selling. Unexpectedly, the market was hit by this setback and gradually fell to a low price of 1,625 yuan. Subsequently, there were rumors in the market, saying that although HSBC's quotation was firm, the settlement price was still low. For a time, the market was still chaotic. As for a group of short sellers, they took advantage of the wind to make a quick buck. The situation rebounded to 1,675 yuan. The closing price was 1,670 yuan. Currently, the gauze market is deeply afraid of remaining volatile, because people's minds are in chaos. However, if the foreign exchange rate can be quoted above five yuan, prices can be stabilized, and those who hoard goods will also lack enthusiasm. The transaction volume for half a day was 8,605 bales. There was no market in the afternoon. Yesterday, 1,650 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each trading group is listed as follows: Hong Kong 305, peers 8,500, total 8,805.

The futures market situation of Gold Double Horses turned from firm and rising to sharply falling, with extremely violent reactions. At the opening in the morning, the sentiment was mostly excited due to the slight increase in American cotton. Bull positions followed the surge of factory orders, absorbing the momentum after the weekend. The market price continued to rise. The August contract opened at 1,515 yuan, a sudden increase of 12 yuan. Afterwards, the gold market suddenly plummeted by more than 400 yuan due to the rise in foreign exchange. HSBC's commercial exchange rate was quoted at 5.3125 yuan. Therefore, people were uneasy and panicked. Factory orders fell sharply, as much as 70 or 80 yuan. Long positions in futures gauze fluctuated, and a large number of positions were liquidated, resulting in a rapid decline of 50 or 60 yuan in an instant. The September contract opened at 1,590 yuan, and the October contract at 1,605 yuan. Afterwards, the August contract fell to a low of 1,460 yuan, the September contract fell to 1,552 yuan, and the October contract fell to 1,580 yuan. The difference between the high and low prices reached more than 20 yuan to 50 or 60 yuan. Subsequently, short positions were covered at lower prices, and the market rebounded. The morning close for the August contract was 1,485 yuan, the September contract was 1,579 yuan, and the October contract was 1,580 yuan. The transaction volume in the morning was 15,600 yuan. There was no market for factory orders in the afternoon, and trading seemed relatively blind. In addition, the gold market fluctuated, and people's minds were initially difficult to grasp. Afterwards, the trend reversed, suddenly rising in the midst of the softening gold market. The August contract rose to a high of 1,489 yuan, the September contract rose to 1,582 yuan, and the October contract rose to 1,600 yuan. The foundation was solid, and long positions remained firm. As a result, the August contract was 1,489 yuan, closing down 14 yuan. The September contract was 1,576 yuan, down 13 yuan. The October contract was 1,599 yuan, closing down 8 yuan. The closing prices for near and distant months differed by a huge sum of 110 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 22,030 bales, an increase of 9,340 bales compared to the previous day. Considering the huge plunge in the gold market, the foundation of the gauze market can be said to be extremely solid. However, if the exchange rate continues to rise, those engaged in the industry should be cautious about being hit and moving downstream. The daily price table is listed below:

### Sudden Increase in US Exchange Rate; Futures for Cotton Increase Sharply; Over 4,000 Pieces of Indian Cotton Arrive

Orders: Due to enthusiastic buying by the public, the spot market for foreign cotton in Shanghai is thriving. At the same time, due to the sudden drop in the price of gold at the opening yesterday morning and the sudden increase in the US exchange rate, factories and cotton dealers took the opportunity to buy US exchange and vigorously purchase foreign cotton. This is because obtaining a longer-term foreign exchange rate enables them to purchase spot goods that will arrive in Shanghai in the near future, which is more profitable than purchasing spot goods in the local market. Therefore, in addition to a small number of spot transactions of American cotton and Brazilian cotton in recent days, the total amount of Brazilian cotton futures sold by various foreign cotton trading firms has reached about 2,000 bales. Moreover, if its selling price is compared with the spot price of Shanghai cotton, the difference is nearly 70 or 80 yuan, which is undoubtedly a good opportunity for all parties to actively place orders.

Arrivals: A large batch of Indian cotton was transshipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan vessel arrived at the port the day before yesterday (the 17th). In addition to transporting foreign rice, it also carried 2,134 pieces of cotton. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying 2,104 pieces of cotton from Hong Kong. The cotton carried by the two vessels is all produced in India. It is reported that a certain Japanese merchant in the city purchased it. It was originally intended to be transported by Japanese vessels, but due to the suspension of Japanese vessels to India, it was transported to Hong Kong by British vessels and then transshipped to Shanghai. In the future, it is feared that this cotton will arrive from time to time.

Spot Goods: The spot cotton situation is very firm. Although the foreign exchange rate has surged and the gauze market is chaotic, and speculators have been greatly hit, prices are still not constrained by changes in other prices due to enthusiastic current demand. The opening quotes are recorded again as follows: Middling 714, Yufeng 200 pieces sent to the factory; Middling 717, Yufeng 100 pieces sent to the factory; Middling 720, Yufeng 200 pieces sent to the factory; Middling 688, House Brand 100 pieces delivered ex-warehouse; Middling 710, House Brand 100 pieces delivered ex-warehouse; Middling 690, House Brand 100 pieces delivered ex-warehouse; Brazilian Cotton 610, House Brand 123 pieces delivered ex-warehouse; Brazilian Cotton 683, House Brand 200 pieces delivered ex-warehouse; Brazilian Cotton 690, House Brand 160 pieces delivered ex-warehouse.

### Food: Entirely Reliant on the Rise of Foreign Exchange to Allow People's Food Supply to Have a Breather; Fortunately, There are 50,000 Bags of Newly Ordered and Arriving Rice, Otherwise, It Would Suffer from an Endless Surge of Eight Yuan

After the holiday yesterday, foreign rice sellers generally cited the rise in the previous week, and their sentiments remained firm. At the opening of the morning market, they all held goods and tried hard to raise prices, thinking that the Public Works Department's rice had suddenly increased by eight yuan. Scattered retail sellers, etc., were quite active. The Small Grain Bank Warehouse once again opened at 127 yuan, and the Foreign Warehouse at 126 yuan. Just as they were excited, the foreign exchange rate suddenly surged, and all foreign rice orders were approved. As a result, new transactions involved 2,500 tons of small grain, including 1,000 tons of small grain (some say it was Min Dang) thrown out by Shen Ji, priced at 152 yuan, and 1,500 tons of small grain loaded in early August and early September, priced at 151 yuan. Other foreign firms and Chinese merchants also had multiple negotiations underway. The atmosphere in the market suddenly changed. Long speculators were timid and sought to sell, and retailers turned from buying to selling. The market price repeatedly fell in the heavy selling atmosphere. For example, Small Grain East Warehouse was as high as 126.5 yuan in the early morning market, but closed as low as 124 yuan. Yinghua Company's Small Grain initially opened at 154 yuan, then successively fell from 153.5 yuan, 3 yuan, 2.5 yuan, and 2 yuan to as low as 151.5 yuan. Second-grade rice fell from 147 yuan to as low as 146 yuan and was still subject to buyers. Other types of rice all rose first and then fell, and the final closing prices were all 1.5 yuan to 2 yuan lower than last Saturday. The total market turnover of spot rice was 7,000 bags, Yinghua Company 560 tons.

Foreign rice arriving at the port yesterday: The Zhishali ship of the Java Company arrived in Shanghai on Saturday evening last week, carrying 10,000 bags of foreign rice from Java, berthing at the Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading; The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan ship arrived at the port at noon on the 17th, carrying 3,039 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, berthing at Pudong, and will be moved to the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession within days; The Ganzhou ship arrived at the port yesterday morning, also carrying 5,290 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, berthing at Pudong when entering the port, and will be moved to the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession within days; Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying 6,480 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, berthing at the Rochefort Wharf for unloading. The above four ships carried a total of more than 24,800 bags of foreign rice, all of which were passenger and cargo ships. (Zu)

Due to the accumulation of arrivals, thick and thin japonica rice markets also became fatigued, and local stores were all sluggish, so the market prices were difficult to support and fell. Early indica rice from South Harbor opened at 154 yuan, then 152.5 yuan; Wuxi Special Japonica at 155 yuan, Zhongguan at 147 yuan, and Sujia at 144.2 yuan. Newly harvested japonica rice was difficult to stand firm and depreciated by one or two yuan. Fourteen loads were sold, priced at 158 yuan and 156 yuan.

Yesterday, glutinous rice had a good appetite at local shops and food stalls, so the sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, and the price alone remained strong. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened at 130 yuan, then fell to 126 yuan; Special glutinous tea opened at 118 yuan, then fell to 115 yuan; Broken glutinous rice at 103 yuan; National glutinous rice at 130 yuan.

### Relentless Rise in Oil Beans Causes Hardship for General Living

The price of soybeans continued to rise. Yesterday, sellers still used the excuse of a shortage of sources to hoard goods and push up prices, and the market was moving towards a new peak. It is estimated that 300 bags of Jiaozhou soybeans were sold, priced at 63 yuan; 200 bags of Qingkou soybeans were priced at 62.5 yuan; 600 bags of Guide soybeans were priced at 59.2 to 61 yuan, a sharp increase of two or three yuan compared to the previous day. Yesterday, 240 bags of soybeans and 1,240 pieces of bean cakes were shipped to Hong Kong. Tofu shops and dried tofu curd sheets are at least five cents, causing great hardship for general living.

The prices of edible oils rose and fell. Raw soybean oil was still selling well due to a shortage of goods. It was reported that the off-market price of Qingdao raw soybean oil had reached 310 yuan, and Dayou factory soybean oil was at 226 yuan. However, the prices of vegetable oil and cottonseed oil were affected by the loosening of gold exchange rates, and the thoughts of scattered hoarding were quite shaken, resulting in prices being lowered by 5, 6, or 7 yuan. A total of 700 dan of Qingyou oil from Dayou Factory were sold, as well as 100 dan of vegetable oil, more than 2,000 dan of vegetable oil from Rihua Factory, 100 dan of vegetable oil from Lide Factory, and 50 barrels each of vegetable oil from Yoshida and Taishan Factories. Although the door-to-door sales price of raw soybean oil on the market is still 2.16 yuan per catty, the quality of the oil is quite uneven, and the profit margins are very high. Generally, the more expensive the price, the more you spend, and the worse the quality of the materials you get.

### Securities: Strong Support from Multiple Parties for Domestic Debt; China Electric and Ye Guang Stocks All See High Prices

Over-the-counter trading of government bonds was increasingly deserted yesterday. Therefore, multiple parties boldly raised prices, because there were very few opponents and the opportunity was excellent. Even multiple parties were making prices for each other. For example, the quoted high price for Class C yesterday was 7.8 yuan, which was not a formal market price. Therefore, after 8.8 yuan, it immediately fell to 6.5 yuan. The authenticity of the market price was immediately apparent. Yesterday, due to the manipulation of gold prices, there was a sudden drop of 500 yuan, which caused speculation in the government bond market and slightly improved the situation. Although the market price rebounded by three to five cents, Lianyi Dingkang bought in, and Runli Hongda Renfeng Tongkang sold out in the morning. The closing price in the afternoon was slightly better by about three cents. In the afternoon, Hongda covered, Yichang Shengchang bought in, and Runli continued to sell. Xinhua Yongkang sold out 90% of their holdings. Class C once saw a high price of 7.8 yuan, but immediately fell. As a result, except for Class D, which did not open, all other classes rebounded by 1.5 to 5.5 cents. The transaction volume was only 800,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

In stock trading, 200 shares of China Merchants Electric Company were traded at a price of 9.5 yuan.

The Ye Guang Real Estate stock market opened strong and then softened, but the underlying trend was still good. The volume of Ye Guang Real Estate stock was extremely high, reaching as high as 21.75 yuan, and closed at 21 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Japanese Merchants' Monopoly; Large-Volume Shanghai Silk; Extremely Prosperous Transactions by Third-Country Exporters; A Total of Five or Six Thousand Bales of Raw Silk Shipped to the United States

With the freezing of Japanese funds by Britain and the United States, raw silk was also included. Although it has not been fully implemented, Japan has adopted the same policy. Two weeks ago, it was rumored in Shanghai that an order had come from Tokyo, prohibiting the export of raw silk from Central China and stopping the supply to the United States. At that time, the Japanese silk industry, after receiving this news, was worried that a large number of stored silk would have no way to sell, and the market price would inevitably fall. Therefore, they urgently sold a large amount of raw silk to third-country export companies. As a result, silk companies such as Jardine Matheson Dachang, which had been depressed for a long time, have seen unprecedented prosperity in transactions in the past half month. This month, various third-country exporters in Shanghai will ship a total of five or six thousand bales of raw silk to the United States on the Coolidge vessel.

### Piece Goods: Cloth Factories Limited by Electricity; Reduced Output; Easily Exploited by Speculators

Factory Cloth: The market fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon. Colored goods and fine yarn goods have been sharply raised in price because silk factories are limited by electricity, the output has decreased, spot goods are in short supply, and it is easy for speculators to take advantage. Therefore, cloth prices rebounded rapidly. As a result, white goods, coarse and fine cloth, twill flannelette, and part of the cloth increased by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. Colored cloth, bleached cloth, line wool, and poplin increased by 5 cents to 1.5 yuan. The Nanyang gang had the strongest demand, with transactions of more than 500 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, colored cloth, group cloth, khaki, etc. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs transacted more than 300 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, etc. The wholesale transactions in the local market were low. Dyeing factories bought more than 500 pieces of gray cloth, etc. On the 18th, a total of 150 pieces of piece goods were exported to Hong Kong.

### Coal: Sudden Drop of Fifty Yuan in Indian Coal

Indian bituminous coal has recently become a scarce commodity due to the lack of old orders in the market, which has attracted attention from insiders. A small number of transactions were made by a certain household a few days ago, with prices as high as 550 yuan, asking for sky-high prices without any standard. Yesterday, since the sharp fall in the foreign exchange market, people's sentiments have become equal. A large number of hoarders liquidated, and the market price suddenly dropped. It was reported that a certain firm opened with a bid of only 500 yuan, and some transactions were also made. In short, in the recent coal market, insiders have stopped selling, and the market is manipulated by hoarders, with huge fluctuations.

### Metals: Soaring American Tinplate

American tinplate circulating on the market is in short supply due to no overseas arrivals and limited inventories. Therefore, although the customs prohibits its export, the market atmosphere is still booming. It is found that the current market price, regardless of thickness, is shouted at 600 yuan per dan (i.e., 24, 26, and 28 gauge are all sold at this price), a huge increase of 20 to 30 yuan compared to the previous market.

Life

### Beyond Adequate Clothing and Food

— Xiao Yun

In this era of suffering, lack of clothing and food is a common occurrence. Clothing and food are the foundation of life, so they are naturally important. However, among the fortunate ones who have adequate clothing and food, we can find some regrettable phenomena.

"My dad is a typical stern father, constantly thinking about economics all day long, as if he wants to swallow the newspaper every day. The children haven't seen a smile on his face for ten years. He doesn't seem to know that exquisite clothing and food cannot satisfy the inner needs of the children. I would rather not ride in a car or live in a foreign-style building, but for Dad to be able to talk and laugh with us. I hope he is a rickshaw puller, not a banker. There seems to be a layer of separation between me and him. I can't get close to him, and he can't understand me." This is from a letter from a fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl, the inner pain of an unfortunate fortunate one.

Humans certainly rely on material things and money to maintain life, but life is by no means something that can be solved solely by material things and money. In addition to material enjoyment, we also need spiritual love and understanding.

Whether life is happy or not depends on whether the way of life is reasonable. A person who is overly focused on material enjoyment often does not know how to achieve a reasonable life. They do not know that beyond adequate clothing and food, there are other needs.

Please think about it, what else do your children need besides clothing and food?

### The Demise of Little Mussolini

— Hua Zhi

The black-shirted Prime Minister Mussolini, who was a hero of his time, can be said to have had "multiple misfortunes" this year. Not only have his troops suffered repeated defeats in East Africa and Greece, but his position in the country also relies entirely on German secret agents to support him. His daughter, the wife of Foreign Minister Ciano, once fell into the water and nearly drowned. Not many days ago, his second son, Bruno, was reported to have died in a plane crash.

Among Mussolini's sons, the two eldest, Soluno and Vittorio, have both joined the air force and serve as junior officers. Bruno, who was about twenty-four years old, had already obtained a pilot's license at the age of seventeen. When the Abyssinian War broke out, he was only eighteen years old and served as an air force combatant. Later, he joined the Italian Volunteer Corps and went to Spain to help the Nationalist Army fight. When the Italian army attacked Greece, Bruno and his brother Vittorio flew bombers to bomb Athens and other places.

In his private capacity, Bruno served as the manager of the Latin American Airlines. The airline operated a very long route, from Rome to Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, and from there to the capitals of Argentina and Chile.

Bruno's flying record reached about two thousand hours. He had extensive experience in flying civil and military aircraft. He claimed that he liked aerial combat the most, his reason being: "Because aerial combat inspires people, increases the tension of life, and also makes people have a more practical feeling about life. A novice civilian pilot can never imagine the many techniques he needs to learn in aerial combat. Only after encountering enemy aircraft, passing through enemy fire, or witnessing anti-aircraft shells exploding around him, can he truly understand the conditions necessary for a true aerial warrior. War makes him a pilot and a hero. So this is a way to make a name for oneself."

Mussolini's sons were all strong, active, thrifty, and hardworking. Bruno was especially impressive. He did not put on the airs of the Prime Minister's son in the army. The people in his team called him by his first name and joked with him. But he was not without a sense of majesty. He often twirled his short, unkempt mustache to show his inviolability, but this only added to the laughter of others.

As for whether Bruno was a war fanatic who wanted to become a bloodthirsty demon? Not so. He told people that he hoped the war would end sooner so that he could work hard to develop his civilian airline.

This time, he was test-flying a new long-range bomber near Pisa when he crashed while attempting a safe landing, which can be said to be an unexpected disaster.

Hitler, upon hearing of his ally Mussolini's grief over the loss of his son, immediately sent a telegram to comfort him. In fact, in this European war led by Germany, Little Mussolini can be said to have died an unjust death.

Psychology

### Are Old People Forgetful?

— Xin Liang

We probably all agree that older people are forgetful compared to young people. According to psychology experts, a person's memory slowly begins to decline when they reach nearly forty years old. From this time on, learning new things seems much more difficult. But memorizing poems and remembering numbers are not affected. Therefore, the so-called decline in memory cannot be generalized.

Recently, a psychology expert used eleven different methods to test the strength of memory, including memorizing sentences, remembering three-digit numbers, paragraph recitation, silent writing, silent drawing, and other tests. Paragraph recitation is certainly more difficult than remembering numbers and silent writing. As for silent drawing, it requires not only good memory but also drawing ability.

Memory is often only one-sided. For example, many people can only remember different faces and cannot remember their names. Everyone's memory is also not the same. Generally, smart people's memory declines slightly slower than that of foolish people.

The expert mentioned above said that older people cannot integrate well with new things, resulting in forgetfulness.

To remedy the shortcoming of forgetfulness, psychologists have come up with many methods for us. They tell us to record important things in a memo book at any time and place so that we can browse them at will in our spare time and avoid forgetting. Secondly, do not rely solely on young people because you are old. We know that the more you rely on others, the greater the forgetfulness. If we want to remember, then we should memorize it ourselves; those elderly people who are sensitive and able to adapt to new environments must have a relatively strong memory.

Finally, reading can also help us remember. Many people say before they are old, "It's useless, now is not the time to read!" In fact, they are all wrong. Reading will exercise our thinking ability and thus enhance memory.

### Selling Cartilage

— Shen Xiong

Normally, we only hear about blood donation societies, but now there are companies that sell cartilage. But, does this represent the progress of modern science, or is it an irony of this society where money is omnipotent?

If a person's nose is accidentally broken, he can consult a plastic surgeon. The doctor can find a way to take a small piece of cartilage from his ribs and graft it onto his nose. However, this requires two surgeries.

But if the patient has money, he can buy a piece of someone else's cartilage. Currently, there are more than a hundred men and women registered with a certain company in New York to sell cartilage. The cost is approximately one hundred to five hundred US dollars.

There are five places in the human body where cartilage can be extracted: the nose, both ears, and both sides of the ribs. The ribs usually removed are about half an inch wide and a quarter of an inch long. The highest record is half an inch wide and two inches long.

When transplanting cartilage from another person, two plastic surgeons are also needed. One performs surgery on the "seller," and the other performs surgery on the "buyer."

11 The Serenade at Midnight

Suddenly, she saw that there was a huqin hanging below the frame on the wall.

"Mom, don't be angry, I've already learned how to sing opera!" She said, leaning on her mother's knees, "As long as I can become famous in the future, you and Dad will be able to eat well for the rest of your lives!"

"Sing opera? Can you even sing opera?" Mom asked with a doubtful expression.

At this moment, her teacher Shang Laoer had already walked in very amusingly. Even Mei Bao didn't know where he came from. Shang Laoer's face, as usual, was piled with a very special smile. He seemed to know Mei Bao's mother too. As soon as he came in, he greeted her and then immediately took down the huqin from the wall and played a passage of Erhuang music.

"Mom, don't you believe me? I'll sing a section for you right away!" Mei Bao said excitedly.

She didn't say anything, just smiled and nodded.

"I... here, brother, lazily open my eyes..." Mei Bao then used all her strength to sing loudly on the pit. "Shake, shake, twist and move forward... I have to..."

Before she could sing three or four sentences, she startled the begonia on the opposite couch.

When he first woke up, he didn't know that the opera singer was in the room. He thought that Yu was drunk and yelling outside. Later, when he calmed down, he realized that the opera singer was actually Mei Bao.

"What are you doing? Mei Bao!" He yelled and jumped off the pit.

"...Red Luo tent, inverted phoenix head..." Mei Bao didn't wake up and was still singing on. (188)

### Cloud Observation Machine

— Ke Zhong

Dr. Niu Bojie, a professor at the Provincial University of Pan Province in the United States, has recently invented a cloud observation machine that can predict the shape and changes of clouds in the sky within two to four hours on a clear day. Dr. Niu discovered that whenever there is a sudden increase in the concentration of microparticles in the air, clouds are bound to appear in the sky within four hours. These so-called concentration microparticles are coal smoke and dust in the air, which usually maintain a balance with the temperature in the air. However, if the temperature suddenly increases, this equilibrium will be disrupted, and the humidity in the microparticles will increase rapidly, creating water droplets. These water droplets then gather to form clouds. Although this type of observation machine can only be used when there are no clouds in the sky, it is indeed a great contribution to meteorology.

### On Chen Hongsheng’s “Playing Repertoire”

— Mu Yun

Tianchan has hired Mr. Chen Hongsheng and his sister to come south, which is considered appropriate by commentators. I have previously written an article in this publication to introduce them. Now, the repertoire of "playing repertoire" that the Chen siblings will perform has been announced, and those in Shanghai who are confused about Chen's school of performance should be able to find an answer. Chen Hongsheng initially studied under Xiao Hongsheng, mastering all the strengths of the Liu school. Before long, his voice gave out, and he gradually drew from the styles of Tan, Yu, and even Ma. The other night, I and others discussed the "playing repertoire" with Chen. Chen cited what he could do, each drawing on the strengths of various schools, no longer restricting his free style with the style of a single school. Chen’s three-day “playing repertoire” was originally intended to draw from Tan, Liu, and Ma, each exhausting the strengths of one school each day, but Mr. Chen feared that this would confuse the audience, as if they were lost. Therefore, based on the current environment, three plays were chosen. The first night will be the complete "Qin Huan's Exile and Night Attack on Dengzhou," with Hongsheng playing the complete role of Qin Huan, wearing black third-class official attire and a cyan arrow jacket, displaying an air of heroic spirit amidst elegance. Today's performing old male roles often prefer "Questioning the Woodcutter and Ruckus at the Mansion," but in fact, "Night Attack on Dengzhou" has frequent movements, which is quite different from "Hong Men Banquet". "Questioning the Woodcutter" has little singing, while in "Night Attack on Dengzhou", starting from Sanjiadian, several sections of flowing water melodies require strict rhythm and full expression. Without a good voice, it is not easy to please the audience. The second day will be "Su Wu Herding Sheep." Many who study Ma's style can perform this, but this play is not Ma's creation; it was Ma who promoted and glorified it. Lao Lu's "Su Wu Herding Sheep" has a completely different appearance from that of Lian Liang. Chen aims to emulate Wen Ru in his acting, seeking expressiveness in his singing, and incorporating his own strengths, making it another masterpiece. The third night will be the complete "White Python Terrace," starting from taking Luoyang and ending at the White Python Terrace in Yuntai Temple. Taking Luoyang will be performed by Tang Songqiao as Ma Wu, while Xue Qiao will play Cen Peng, Yang Bao will play Deng Yu, and Chen Ling will play the complete role of Wang Mang. It is well known that this play requires extraordinary singing skills. Prefacing it with "Taking Luoyang" makes it even more brilliant. It is said that the date of Chen's performance has been set for the twentieth of this month, and a grand occasion is expected at that time.

### After Seeing “Grape Wine”

— Hui Feng

“Grape Wine” was originally named "Luminous Cup." After the war, it was very popular in various parts of the mainland. It was banned in Shanghai for a period and not allowed to be performed. Not long ago, the Tianfeng Drama Society rehearsed it for several weeks, renaming it "Gratitude and Revenge," starring Murong Wan'er, and received considerable praise. Now, China Travel has renamed it "Grape Wine" again and added a first act to the original four acts, making it a total of five acts. The dialogue and plot in the middle have also been slightly changed, but the general plot and theme remain the same.

The story takes place a little over ten years ago, during the era of warlord rule. A dancer, Chen Fengyun, was entrusted by revolutionaries to assassinate the wicked warlord Huang Boren in Hankou, due to both personal vendettas and public outrage. Huang was originally a patron who pursued her, so it was easy to approach him, but because of the tight security, she struggled to find a way to strike. She had to seduce Huang's trusted adjutant, Yu Zhong, explain the greater good, and persuade him to assassinate Boren together. Yu Zhong was an upright young man who immediately realized Huang's wickedness and his own responsibility, and he made up his mind to eliminate the scourge. Unexpectedly, Yu's mother found out about this. She was originally Huang's wet nurse, and due to a kind of ignorant feeling and to save Yu Zhong's life, she told Huang about it. Huang immediately arrested the two, first executing Yu Zhong and then forcing Fengyun to confess. Fengyun knew that her lover had also been killed, and in deep hatred, she decided to sacrifice herself to get revenge. She managed to put poison in the grape wine and die with Huang.

The main point of this play is not to expose the sins of the warlords, but to awaken those who act as lackeys for evil demons, and to condemn their ignorance. Yu Zhong was originally an upright and promising young man, but because he lacked clear understanding, he became a henchman for a warlord and forgot his responsibility to the country and nation. Later, he realized his mistake, and although his plan failed and he died, his death was glorious, far better than his previous foolish loyalty to Huang. Also, Yu's mother's ignorance was the biggest factor in causing the tragedy. She was unaware of the consequences, blindly ignorant, only concerned with the favors the master gave them. In order to save her son's life and position, she ruined the important matter and cost her son's life. People with such a dim awareness do not deserve sympathy and should be eliminated.

### Miscellaneous Drama Notes

— Fen Yu

The playwriting committee formed by the merger of the old and new stages will hold its sixth theater affairs meeting at the Daya Building tomorrow at noon to discuss the rehearsal of the opera "Magpie Bridge Meeting" and the six-part "New Journey to the West."

The ceremony for Wensheng and martial arts performer Li Ruchun to recognize Zhao Ruquan as his adoptive father was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at Tian Shuilu. Famous actors present included Zhou Xinfang, Gai Jiaotian, Lin Shusen, and Liu Hanchen. The ceremony was quite grand.

The Shanghai Drama School originally planned to perform twelve consecutive days of daytime performances at the Tianchan Theater, but because of an agreement with Huang Jin, it has been cancelled. The school will wait until Ji Yuliang's term is over and then follow up with performances in the evening.

The martial arts star Gai Jiaotian has recovered from his illness, and the blood tonic injections have also been stopped. According to the doctor, he can resume training in a month and officially return to the stage by the end of the year.

### Chrysanthemum Kingdom Spring and Autumn

— Xiao Xian

(3) Storms Arise from Huang Guiqiu's Apprenticeship (Part 1)

In the northern opera world, in addition to the Four Famous Dan performers, there are also the Four Unlucky Dan performers. The so-called Four Unlucky Dan performers refer to Xu Biyun, Zhu Qinxin, Huang Guiqiu, and Wang Youqing. Because these four female roles all possess superb artistry but have always been extremely unlucky, they are called the Four Unlucky Dan performers. Speaking of the Four Unlucky Dan performers, Xu, Zhu, and Wang have long been silent, only Huang Guiqiu is still struggling with the environment, continuing his stage life. Although Guiqiu does not perform often in the north now, he is striving to make progress in his art. Recently, he has the motivation to study under Wang Yaoqing to seek further advancement. Because he knows that if he can get Yaoqing's guidance, he will definitely be able to get unlimited help in the field of art. Therefore, a month ago, he entrusted his friend Zhang Xiaoshan (one of the earliest famous amateur performers in the former capital who studied Wang Yaoqing and had a deep friendship with Yaoqing, also a disciple of Wang) to seek Yaoqing's consent. Unexpectedly, this Master of All Trades who specializes in accepting disciples expressed absolute refusal to accept Huang Guiqiu, introduced by Zhang Xiaoshan, and even launched into a fit of complaining. Why did Yaoqing complain? This is a long story.

It turns out that twenty years ago, Huang Guiqiu once wanted to study under Wang Yaoqing. At that time, Yaoqing readily agreed and even set a date to hold the apprenticeship ceremony. Unexpectedly, at this time, someone suggested to Huang Guiqiu that it would be better to study under Chen Delin than under Wang Yaoqing, because Yaoqing was Delin's disciple. Studying under Delin would allow him to be called teacher-brothers with Yaoqing, which seemed to increase his status invisibly. Huang Guiqiu was greatly moved upon hearing this, and so, in the very short process that Wang Yaoqing had prepared to accept Huang Guiqiu as a disciple, this Mr. Huang went back on his word and joined the ranks of Chen "Stone" Delin's disciples. Naturally, Wang Yaoqing was very dissatisfied with Huang Guiqiu at the time, but because the other party was his teacher, he had to swallow his anger, but this breath has remained in his stomach ever since.

### Jade Blossoms in a Sea of Blood

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 14: Round Round, Little Words, Delicate Silk

So she said to him, "I'm afraid this humble servant doesn't have such fortune. I imagine there must be many beautiful women in the residence. How can my willow-like appearance be worthy of being among them?" Tian Hongyu smiled again and said, "Oh, don't be so modest. Although my home has many beauties, how can they compare to you? If you don't believe me, come with me to my house and you will naturally know. I will call you the most beautiful woman in the world." Round Round heard him getting closer with his words, and dared not say anything more. She went to fetch a small knife and peeled a pair of snow pears for him to eat. Unexpectedly, at this time, the flower butterfly came again. The more Round Round didn't welcome him, the more he wanted to come. Round Round secretly cursed him. Tian Hongyu said to him with a smile, "Why are you so late?" The flower butterfly said, "This young one has been here for some time." As he spoke, he whispered a few words into Tian Hongyu's ear. Tian Hongyu nodded and said, "Very good, very good, I understand." Tian Hongyu understood, but Round Round understood even less. She didn't know what the flower butterfly was up to, but she guessed that he must be plotting something in front of her, so she had to be wary. She hated the flower butterfly even more, only hoping that tomorrow night would come quickly so she could fly away with the jade-cherishing poet, and then she could escape this predicament. When the flower butterfly saw Round Round, he still chatted with her as "Miss" this and "Miss" that. Round Round thought that one could only treat such people like a Buddha and guard against them like a thief, so she had to put on a slight false face. Tian Hongyu sat in Round Round's dressing room, happy and reluctant to leave, as if he had entered Mount Tian Tai with Liu Lang. In the evening, he set up a banquet upstairs, ordering Round Round to pour wine and sing songs. Other guests who came were politely rejected by the foster mother. Everyone heard that the Father-in-law of the Nation was here, so they had to retreat three times. Round Round was afraid that Tian Hongyu would come again tomorrow night, and she and the poet would not be able to leave, so she deliberately invited Tian Hongyu to come again for a happy drink the day after tomorrow. She also said that she would go to Qionglong Mountain to burn incense tomorrow afternoon, and she might not be able to return, and she might have to spend the night on the mountain. (145)
