### Key Leader of Japanese Extremists, Hideki Tojo, Ordered to Form Cabinet

Known for Endorsing Tanaka's Policy of Aggression, Future Actions Attract Widespread Attention

Tokyo, 17th (United Press) - The Japanese Emperor today, in the afternoon, ordered Lieutenant General Hideki Tojo, the Minister of War of the Third Konoe Cabinet, to form a new cabinet. Before ordering Tojo to form a new cabinet, the Emperor consulted with Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kido and senior statesmen to select a leader for the new cabinet.

Tokyo, 17th (Reuters) - Tojo, who served as Minister of War in both the Second and Third Konoe Cabinets, has been ordered to form a new cabinet. Previously, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kido held a meeting with senior statesmen, including Privy Council President Hara Yoshimichi, former Prime Ministers Baron Wakatsuki Reijiro, Hirota Koki, Admiral Okada Keisuke, General Hayashi Senjuro, General Abe Nobuyuki, and General Yonai Mitsumasa. Following the meeting, they recommended Tojo to the Emperor for the position of Prime Minister. Tojo was summoned to the palace at 4:35 PM and received the order to form a cabinet. After leaving the palace, former Navy Minister Oikawa was immediately summoned to the palace in succession. It is said that the Emperor personally informed Oikawa about the appointment of Tojo to form a cabinet. This kind of action is not unprecedented. When Admiral Yonai was appointed Prime Minister on January 16, 1940, the Emperor also personally summoned General Hata Shunroku to the palace. Tojo was born in 1884 into a military family. He graduated from the Army Staff College in 1915. In 1919, he served as a military attaché in Germany. In 1922, he was an instructor at the Staff College. In 1934, he was the commander of the 24th Brigade. In 1935, he was the commander of the Kempeitai. In 1937, he was the chief of staff of the Kwantung Army. Later, he was transferred to the post of Director of Army Aviation. In July 1940, he was appointed Minister of War in the Second Konoe Cabinet.

London, 17th (Reuters) - Reuters' Far East expert stated that Lieutenant General Tojo, who was ordered to form a cabinet today, has long been regarded as one of the most ardent leaders of Japanese imperialist aggressors. Since the cabinet of General Tanaka in 1928, Tojo is the first army general to become prime minister, with the exception of General Abe, who briefly served as prime minister in the autumn of 1939. Judging from Tojo's experience, it can be said that he fully agrees with the Tanaka Memorial. Tojo is upright and honest, with an extremely loyal attitude, but he is one of the main leaders of the extremists. This order to form a cabinet proves the general opinion regarding Konoe's resignation, that extremism has now triumphed. As for whether this will lead to action and in which direction it will develop, these are all separate questions.

Tokyo, 17th (Reuters) - It is generally expected here that the new cabinet will be clearly under military influence, but there is no reliable information about the possible candidates for the new cabinet.

Tokyo, 17th (Reuters) - The fact that former Navy Minister Oikawa was summoned to the palace after Tojo has aroused speculation among some people here. It is generally believed that it is related to guaranteeing the Navy's support for the Army's cabinet.

Tokyo, 17th (United Press) - The Domei News Agency, the official Japanese news agency, said that well-informed Japanese sources believe today that the new cabinet will not adopt any drastic new policies, but will concentrate on promoting the basic policies of the Japanese Empire with greater determination. They said that they expect the new cabinet to achieve complete unity on national policy, as the collapse of the Third Konoe Cabinet was due to a lack of unity. They pointed out that Japan's fixed policies are to resolve the China Incident, build a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and adhere to the spirit of the Anti-Comintern Pact. They further emphasized that the new cabinet will strive to achieve Japan's main goals, namely, not only to maintain peace in East Asia, but also to maintain peace throughout the world. At the same time, former Minister of War Tojo has established a headquarters in the Ministry of War and is actively working to form a new cabinet in accordance with the Emperor's order.

Japan Leans Again Towards Axis Powers, Flames of War Spread Across the Pacific

Washington, 17th (United Press) - Well-informed circles believed yesterday that the general resignation of the Konoe Cabinet was a victory for pro-Axis elements in Japan. At the same time, it was reported here that Konoe tied the future of his government to negotiations with the United States. Therefore, Konoe's resignation may indicate that the talks have been unsuccessful. Well-informed circles said that if the new Japanese cabinet is composed of military personnel and neo-Nazis, it will indicate that Japan is prepared to launch hostilities against the Soviet Union, taking advantage of the latter's struggle against Germany on its western border. Well-informed circles said that they were well aware that during the two months of US-Japan negotiations, the Japanese resolutely refused to consider withdrawing from the German-Italian-Japanese Axis, believing that this would not hinder understanding with the United States. Informed sources are closely watching the selection of the Foreign Minister, as the failure of the US-Japan talks was due to Japan's inability to resolve the dispute between the domestic hawks and the liberals, and American diplomats did not know which group in Japan to consult in order to obtain a guarantee that Japan would abide by the agreement.

London, 17th (Reuters) - This morning, British newspapers did not ignore the Japanese cabinet crisis due to the severe situation in Moscow. The Times editorial said that Tojo's appointment can be regarded as the harbinger of Japan's return to the Axis and the virtual termination of talks with Washington. The German advance towards Moscow and the Don River must have induced the extremists to believe that the time has come to advance further, which is why the Konoe Cabinet collapsed. Informed sources here predict that the new Japanese government led by Tojo may either attack the north or advance south, which may lead to the flames of war in the Pacific.

Singapore, 17th (Reuters) - Responsible officials here are not prepared to express any opinions on the great significance of the Japanese cabinet crisis, but they cannot help but recall that the Japanese army entered Vietnam less than a week after the previous Konoe cabinet resigned three months ago. Qualified observers believe that regardless of the outcome of this cabinet crisis, there are now clear signs that Japan's radical patriots are prepared to place the nation's fate in the hands of Nazi extremists. Their patience has been exhausted by the progress of the Washington talks, and their usual alarmist words may have frightened the Japanese into believing that even a sacrificial war is better than revolution. Singapore Radio commented on the Japanese cabinet crisis tonight, saying that the Japanese are prepared to attack the Soviet Union in the north or Thailand in the south, or even advance on both sides at the same time. Tension in the Far East has never been closer to the breaking point. What will follow Japan's future actions is beyond doubt.

Rise of Radical Faction of Japanese Military, May Start War with Soviet Union

Singapore, 17th (Reuters) - The news of the Japanese cabinet's resignation was not considered surprising here. For several weeks, there have been clear signs that the radical faction of the Japanese military was becoming increasingly restless and wanted to stage a coup to restore its prestige. At the same time, non-military elements also wanted to seize some real power from the military after the military temporarily lost its prestige. The Konoe Cabinet was composed of both military and civilian factions, and tried hard to delay the situation with the possibility of a settlement with the United States. Now that the delay has been long, and the much-touted settlement with the United States has not materialized under conditions acceptable to the Konoe Cabinet, it is even more difficult for the Konoe Cabinet to maintain its position. In the past week, it would be more accurate to say that it was not that the Konoe Cabinet was about to resign, but rather that the cabinet could not confront the military. Therefore, the general feeling is that there is nothing that can be avoided. This resignation of the cabinet is a real decision as to who is in the dominant position, which is very different from the previous cabinet resignations. The atmosphere in Japan is extremely tense and cannot tolerate further hesitation. The fact that the Japanese cabinet crisis broke out as German troops approached the outskirts of Moscow shows that the military demanded that troops be stationed in the Soviet Union when Moscow fell, while the non-military faction was not prepared to agree. Informed sources here predict that there will be much discussion before the new cabinet is formed. At that time, it will be clearly indicated whether the military clique will seize power or whether the civilian faction can reduce and eliminate the power of the military clique as it had intended. The position of the Emperor, which is still highly valued in Japan, is currently ambiguous. Some time ago, it was generally felt that the Emperor also wanted to restrain the military clique, so there was an organization of the National General Headquarters in the hope of curbing extremist elements. However, it is said that the army has since strongly advised the Emperor. What can be predicted at present depends on the discussions that will be held in Tokyo in the next few days or perhaps ten hours, which will determine not only the future of the Japanese military clique in its own country, but also the entire issue of Japan's dispatch of troops to attack the Soviet Union and war and peace in the Far East.

Far Eastern Red Army Has Strong Strength, Japan Will Suffer a Severe Blow if It Invades the North

London, 16th (Havas) - According to Soviet sources here, no matter what happens in the Far East after the Japanese cabinet change, the Red Army in Siberia has sufficient strength to cope with it easily. The reserve troops from the eastern part of the Soviet Union who are going to the Western Front are all newly enlisted soldiers and do not weaken the original strength of the garrison in Siberia. In short, the Red Army in Siberia is well-equipped and engaged in mechanized warfare, which is superior to the Japanese army.

### White House Holds Special Meeting to Discuss How to Deal with the Far East Crisis, Important Military and Political Leaders Attend

Washington, 17th (Reuters) - President Roosevelt suddenly convened a special meeting yesterday, attended by Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Secretary of War Stimson, Army Chief of Staff Marshall, Navy Chief of Staff Stark, and presidential personal representative Hopkins, who had gone to Europe for inspection, to discuss the Far East situation and the Lend-Lease Act. The meeting lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. After the meeting, Hull told reporters that he was ordered not to make any comments and that he did not know whether the White House would issue a statement. When reporters asked if there would be another meeting, Hull replied that there should be another meeting soon. Other attendees were also ordered not to make any comments.

### East Daily Continues to Attack the United States

Wakasugi Revisits Welles, No Progress in US-Japan Talks

Tokyo, 17th (Reuters) - The Asahi Shimbun, the mouthpiece of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, today published an article attacking the United States' Far East policy, saying that Japan's efforts to improve US-Japan relations are merely one-sided goodwill. The article first described the US's meddling in Far Eastern affairs, the most egregious of which is aiding Chongqing, so that Chongqing is now using American weapons, American bullets, and American technology to confront Japan. The United States is also providing Chongqing with military and financial planning. It then said that if the American people could compare the two sides, they would know that Japan has legitimate reasons to complain and that it is justified in implementing its self-defense plans. The Japanese people will still insist that the United States drastically change its policy and first stop being a partner in Chongqing's war.

Washington, 17th (Havas) - Wakasugi, an advisor to the Japanese Embassy in the United States, met with Under Secretary of State Welles today for discussions, which lasted for forty-five minutes.

Tokyo, 17th (Haitong News Agency) - Ishii, a spokesperson for the Japanese government, said yesterday that he does not believe that the US-Japan talks in Washington have made any progress, but the talks have not been suspended and are still continuing. The Domei News Agency protested yesterday against the United States' delaying tactics, which can represent the attitude of most people in Japan. It is still unknown whether Wakasugi has met with US Under Secretary of State Welles.

### Far East Situation Becoming Serious, Observations of Grady

San Francisco, 17th (Reuters) - Roosevelt's Far East economic investigator, Grady, recently returned here from the Far East. According to him, the resignation of the Japanese cabinet has created a very dangerous situation. He believes that the next Japanese cabinet will be strictly militaristic, and it should be known that any cabinet with a special tendency is always dangerous. Grady also said that when he visited the Dutch East Indies, the Dutch East Indies government showed him everything and that they were fully prepared for any emergency.

### American Merchant Ships Ordered to Withdraw from Coastal Waters of China and Japan, American Warship Torpedoed Near Iceland

Washington, 17th (Reuters Urgent) - Responsible authorities stated that all American merchant ships have now been ordered to withdraw from Chinese and Japanese territorial waters due to what the Navy calls the "Pacific situation."

Manila, 17th (Reuters) - According to unconfirmed rumors, all American ships sailing in the Pacific have been ordered to immediately sail to the nearest British or American port. Senior naval officers did not comment on this rumor, but according to a leader in the shipping industry, the Panama cargo ship "Pili Reida" of the US Maritime Commission has been ordered by the Navy to return to Manila.

Washington, 17th (Reuters Urgent)

According to an official announcement, the US destroyer "Kearny" was hit by a torpedo this morning 350 miles southwest of Iceland, in the same area as the US warship "Greer" that was attacked last time. The "Kearny" is one of the latest American destroyers, built just last year, with a displacement of 1,630 tons and equipped with five-inch guns. The captain is Colonel Tai Dennis. The ship has only two funnels, which is clearly different from the four funnels of the destroyers transferred to the United Kingdom. According to naval officers, this point reduces the possibility of being mistaken for a British ship. The US Navy Department has not yet received reports mentioning casualties. Although the ship was damaged, it is still able to proceed on its own power.

### Brief Biography of Tojo

Tokyo, 17th (United Press) - Lieutenant General Hideki Tojo, known for his mental acuity and seemingly inclined towards moderate nationalism rather than extremism, has been ordered to form a cabinet. Tojo's proposal to simultaneously confront the Soviet Union and China is only a matter of time. Tojo served as Minister of War in both the second and third Konoe cabinets and is one of the most famous figures in the Japanese army. The fact that Japanese officers all call him Kamisori, meaning "razor," shows what kind of person he is. "Razor" is a Japanese metaphor for someone who is mentally sharp. Tojo's temperament is entirely inherited from his father. The saying "like father, like son" is truly not false. Tojo's father was a great military strategist who assisted General Kawakami in planning military affairs during the Russo-Japanese War from 1904 to 1905. This Minister of War, who resigned yesterday, became a national hero after delivering a sensational speech in 1939. In 1939, he was the Vice Minister of War in the Hiranuma Cabinet. At that time, there was a Japanese munitions manufacturers association, and Tojo attended the meeting and delivered a speech, arguing that Japan must simultaneously fight on the front lines and in China and predicted that Japan would win. In August 1939, the position of the Hiranuma Cabinet was shaken when Germany and the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression pact after Japan refused to conclude a military alliance with the Axis powers, and it finally resigned. At that time, Tojo served as the Director of the Army Aviation Department and the Commander-in-Chief of Military Aviation. From then on, Tojo's resignation was directly related to his position as Minister of War. Later, Yamada, the successor in military training, recommended him to Konoe as the Minister of War. Tojo graduated from the military academy in 1915. In 1919, he went to Germany to serve as a military attaché and study, learning about the general situation in Europe at that time. After returning to China in 1922, he served as a professor at the military academy. In addition to being the Minister of War, he held various positions in the Ministry of War. Tojo worked hard to expand and transform the Japanese army aviation. After becoming the Minister of War, he told the press, "I know nothing about politics. If you ask me about aviation affairs, I can tell you everything, Yomiuri Shimbun." Tojo has no hobbies other than drinking. Once he starts drinking, he can drink for two or three days without stopping. "Hochi Shimbun" said that Tojo is a teetotaler. The newspaper said that according to Tojo's wife, her husband only drinks one or two glasses of beer when drinking. Tojo's wife also described her husband's daily life, saying, "He gets up very early every day, and his only hobby is reading biographies of world greats. Sometimes I even see him reading economic books. My husband and I have three sons and three daughters, and he never interferes with their aspirations. He is very kind to the weak and never scolds servants. He eats very little at each meal, but he is very healthy." General Tojo was born in December 1884. His hometown is Iwate Prefecture in northern Japan.

### Britain and the United States Support China with All Their Strength, Solving Various Economic Problems

Sir Niemeyer Receives Representatives of Chongqing Press, Governments of Two Democratic Countries Fully Cooperate Sincerely

Chongqing - When Sir Niemeyer, the head of the British economic delegation, received representatives of Chinese and foreign newspapers here for the first time today, he said, "I have come here to seek everything and have no preconceived ideas. Therefore, I cannot currently comment on China's financial and economic situation. The purpose of this trip is to consult with the Chinese authorities to find out the characteristics of China's situation and to use the knowledge and experience I have gained in my work in other countries to help China solve various problems. You should know that I was ordered to come here from another part of the world, and my country is currently engaged in a bitter struggle in that part and has its own financial and economic problems. The United Kingdom is extremely sincere and willing to do its best to contribute to the maintenance and development of China's economy." At that time, Cochran, a representative of the US Department of the Treasury, was also present. According to Cochran, Sir Niemeyer has spoken in detail about the purpose of his visit, and there is no need to repeat it. His stay in China may not be as long as that of Sir Niemeyer, but the US government already has several economists in Chongqing, including Coes, a member of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. (Reuters, 17th)

Chongqing - Sir Niemeyer, head of the British financial and economic delegation, and Mr. Cochran, a special commissioner of the US Department of the Treasury, received Chinese and foreign journalists in the accompanying capital at 11:00 am on the 17th and issued talks to explain the mission of the delegation. Mr. Niemeyer first said, "We have just come to China, and everything

is yet to be studied

, so there are no preconceived ideas. We hope to provide the experience we have gained in Europe and other places to help solve China's problems. We will first discuss specific issues with the Chinese authorities. I was sent to China from the other side of the world when my country was engaged in a major war and had its own difficulties, which is sufficient to show the United Kingdom's

sincere sympathy

for China. We hope to do our best to contribute to China's economy in order to achieve the purpose of solving specific problems. Mr. Cochran and I are here in accordance with the British and American policy of supporting China." Mr. Niemeyer continued, "The Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund is only one aspect of the exchange rate problem." Mr. Niemeyer repeatedly stated that providing our opinions as much as possible to solve these problems is

the sole purpose

of our coming to China. I am very pleased that Mr. Cochran can come with me, which is sufficient to show the determination of the governments of China, Britain, and the United States to fully cooperate and resolve difficult issues, and these problems can only be solved through cooperative efforts. Cochran is an expert assistant to US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. Mr. Cochran told reporters that he was sent to China and worked with Sir Niemeyer, which was

very gratifying

. Sir Niemeyer and I have jointly engaged in various affairs in Europe and the United States. Mr. Cochran also said that Sir Niemeyer personally saw the US government promoting the policy of assisting democratic countries when he was in Washington. Mr. Cochran said that my stay in China will not be as long as that of Sir Niemeyer, but Committee member Forks and Taylor of the Exchange Stabilization Fund are still here. Mr. Forks and others have obtained

a large amount of cooperation

from the Chinese side. We are willing to do our best to help China. " Mr. Cochran also came to China for the first time. He said that the delegation was warmly received by China, and it is expected that the stay in Chongqing will be very pleasant. Mr. Niemeyer also said that he was very pleased to have Baxter to assist him. Mr. Baxter was formerly a financial advisor to Thailand and is currently a financial advisor to Myanmar. Sir Niemeyer

highly praised

Mr. Baxter and said that Mr. Baxter's arrival is sufficient to show the cooperation between the two neighboring countries of China and Myanmar. The working time of the delegation will mostly be in Chongqing, but the exact length of stay in China is not yet determined. When a reporter asked Sir Niemeyer for his opinion on the Japanese cabinet crisis, Mr. Niemeyer declined to answer, but said that this should not

surprise

us very much. Later, when asked about his observations on China's economic situation, Mr. Niemeyer said that the situation is changing very quickly, and I am ashamed that I do not know much, which is why I came to China. What is admirable is that China has experienced difficult times for many years, but the economic situation is not as difficult as imagined. Mr. Niemeyer remained silent on the question of what is the best way to maintain China's currency value, but he spoke a lot about the Exchange Stabilization Fund. He said that the Exchange Stabilization Fund has not been

implemented for long

, and the US freezing of funds is also a recent matter, but these are all tools to support China. The balance of the Exchange Stabilization Fund is still sufficient, but we cannot expect immediate results. When asked about his impression of Chongqing, Mr. Niemeyer replied that he had visited the city many times and learned about Chongqing's past experiences, but the material damage was not very serious, which was surprising.

"Rebuild as soon as it is bombed"

is a description of Sir Niemeyer's visit to the bombed area of Chongqing. Mr. Niemeyer's impression of the citizens of Chongqing is that the people he met were all happy. Regarding the effectiveness of the bombing, Mr. Niemeyer said that the destructive power of the bombing was not as great as we had imagined before experiencing it. (17th dispatch)

### Brooke Popham Warns Japan: Ready to Accept the Challenge

Far East Allied Forces' Position is Now Different from the Past, Recognizes the Great Significance of Japan's Expanding Aviation Routes

Reuters, London, 17th: British newspapers report the words of General Brooke Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Far East, from Melbourne, stating that in recent months, the military and political position of the Allies in the Far East has greatly improved, and the possibility of being attacked has greatly decreased. We do not want to fight Japan, but if Japan insists on a war, then we are ready to deal with it. War equipment is now being transported eastward continuously. The expansion of Japanese aviation routes to Timor Island is of great significance, but if the British side pays close attention, it is not a cause for concern. If we do nothing, Japan will continue to invade, but if we make them understand that we are now awake, then the situation will not develop. Australia is now supplying the equipment needed by the British forces in the East. Anything needed must first be sought from Australia. Brooke Popham has held a meeting with the Australian War Cabinet to discuss maintaining and strengthening the solid defense links from India through northern Australia to New Zealand. Non-Labor Party members of the War Advisory Council also attended the meeting. Representatives of the New Zealand government will participate in the talks next week, and then Brooke Popham will tour New Zealand for staff talks. After returning to Singapore, he will also travel to India within the year. One of the purposes of Brooke Popham's trip is to supply the air force concentrated in Singapore with Beaufort bombers made in Australia.

Editorial

### Factors Hindering Price Stability

Since the recent surge in prices, those with capital have believed that the legal currency will be impossible to manage, and they only know how to hoard and speculate, regardless of the quality of the goods. Speculators believe that the opportunity is not to be missed, and the futures market is turbulent, with prices soaring. As a result, all essential commodities for life, such as rice, coal, oil, flour, clothing, and rent, have all raised their prices. Public opinion is focused on how to curb the malignant inflation of prices and maintain the public's right to life. The Director-General of the Municipal Council has formally stated that he will take appropriate measures to adjust the situation and seek to establish an organization to manage retail prices, and will soon issue an important announcement. Therefore, I do not want to comment on it for now, but I hope that it will be implemented as soon as possible in this increasingly urgent Far East situation.

It is important to know that today's prices are driven by various factors. If the production and trade of goods were not blockaded and controlled, and they could still circulate freely, domestic goods would definitely not be so expensive. Shanghai has always been a port for the concentration of foreign goods and the region with the largest consumption. However, as the European war intensifies, the supply of foreign goods is becoming increasingly scarce, while the general consumption remains unchanged. The gap between supply and demand is widening, and the trend of hoarding is deepening, resulting in unbelievably high prices, which is also something that cannot be helped. However, while this is a reason for the rise in prices, it cannot be said that today's extraordinary prices are entirely due to this reason. The futures market has indeed contributed to the rise in prices. Since the outbreak of the war, there have only been spot transactions, so although there have been ups and downs, they have been somewhat constrained and the changes have been slow. Since the creation of futures, cotton yarn and cotton cloth have futures, oil cakes have futures, US dollars have futures, and even sugar has futures. With a small amount of margin money, large-scale transactions are made, and speculative elements who gamble to win money are like tigers with wings, and they cannot be contained once they start. As a result, futures drive spot prices, causing the prices of spot goods to rise continuously. Even the value of the currency seen today is due to speculators manipulating prices to an infinitely large extent, which reflects the currency value to an infinitely small extent. Is this just an illusion, or should it be regarded as a reality?

Some say that this is not the case. Regardless of the purchasing power of the currency, what represents the currency value is the foreign exchange rate! What is the current exchange rate of the legal currency against foreign currencies? If you still think that this is not the fault of the legal currency itself, who will believe it? Indeed, I do not want to talk about the central government's quoted price. Even the gradual decline of the exchange rate in the past black market was a kind of passive resistance to protect the legal currency. Otherwise, if the legal exchange rate were still maintained, would the legal currency still have its current position? Even the work of today's Exchange Stabilization Fund is for the sake of protecting the legal currency. This has long been implemented in various countries in the East and West, but China is only now learning to walk. Still, there are frequent attacks from internal and external troubles. The people of the country do not know how to support it, but instead destroy it. Exported foreign exchange should be settled according to regulations, but it is not settled. Imports of non-essential goods can be saved, but they are not saved. The black market should not be allowed to occur, but it is still heard of every day. Capital has nowhere to be used, so it escapes. It insists on using goods and foreign currency as a protective talisman for concealment, creating an endless high price. It does not realize that the repeatedly raised prices actually reduce the effectiveness of its capital. It clings to this and does not understand, still thinking that it has succeeded. Its stupidity is truly unmatched. As for those who fail due to speculation, it goes without saying. Therefore, if the public wants the legal currency to become waste paper, then so be it. Otherwise, they can only support national policies and cooperate with the Exchange Stabilization Fund to achieve fulfillment without overflowing.

However, the work of the Exchange Stabilization Fund is widely discussed, and people are wondering how it is being carried out. There is no lack of doubt. How much is being supplied, and which industries are being supplied? Based on what we have heard, if tobacco leaves still have foreign exchange that can be supplied, then the nature of necessities that are more important than tobacco leaves, such as food and clothing, is even easier to obtain foreign exchange. Previously, it was heard that a movie theater that only shows foreign films would not be able to continue to operate normally without the supply of foreign exchange. Now, it is still showing movies as usual. If it did not obtain a guarantee of supply, I am afraid it would not be so peaceful. Therefore, the rumors from the outside that the Exchange Stabilization Fund will supply a certain amount of foreign exchange to Shanghai in a certain month, gradually decreasing until it will no longer be supplied in a certain month, are unfounded and unbelievable. The foreign exchange for luxury businesses is still being supplied, so how can the foreign exchange needed for other daily necessities be withheld and not given? It can be concluded that there is no such fact. As for the foreign exchange needed for rice, there is no problem because the Municipal Council has public sales of rice. As for coal, there are rumors from the outside that it is not easy to apply for foreign exchange, although I do not know how true it is. However, how can the coal purchased by coal companies be guaranteed not to flow out? This is the same nature as cotton mills applying to purchase cotton foreign exchange. The only thing that can be said is that the coal used by power companies should be able to obtain a supply of foreign exchange, so electricity bills should be flat. As for the cotton used by spinning mills, it should be handled in the same way, but in today's society where people's hearts are not as they used to be, who can guarantee that the cotton they purchase will not be replaced? Sugar is inherently a luxury item, but its degree is less than that of tobacco leaves. However, Shanghai imports sugar with foreign exchange, and the sugar in Shanghai is then transported away by people. This means that the foreign exchange for sugar in Shanghai will be consumed without end. Who has such a large amount of supply to maintain the consumption of sugar? It can be seen that the difficulty in obtaining approval for foreign exchange applications is also the fault of the merchants themselves, and it drags down the public! If the industrial and commercial sectors can always prioritize national interests and the well-being of the people, and their will is pure, then all difficulties can be solved easily. The foreign exchange that Shanghai should get will not be without a solution, and the prices in Shanghai will not be difficult to stabilize to a considerable extent. However, the Exchange Stabilization Fund should also announce its approval of the foreign exchange supply to Shanghai, or perhaps there are places where it is inconvenient to announce, so as not to shake the market. I think that there is no need to worry about this. Light will drive away ghosts and monsters, and openness will prevent rumors from spreading. Only by being open can the public understand that this is where foreign exchange is supplied, and this is where there is no supply, so that there will be no confusion. Prices will also have standards for comparison. Why keep it secret and not announce it? Is it to create a hidden place for industrial and commercial sectors that obtain foreign exchange to make unexpected fortunes!

What I don't understand is that since the supply of foreign exchange is limited to fourteen banks, then trade between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands is all within it. Exported foreign exchange in the four countries and their territories should not be difficult to control. Even the transfer of foreign exchange should be on the list of those not allowed. Today, the black market is still allowed, so that goods that are not allowed to be supplied with foreign exchange can still be moved and used elsewhere. This is like criticizing a wise person, and it cannot be said that there is no intention of knowingly letting it happen! Even if there is a small amount of foreign exchange floating outside, it is not difficult to control under the current situation of American control. However, using US dollars to replace US exchange is used to promote speculation and hoarding, disrupt the market, and raise prices. Why is it not prohibited? Is it because the freezing order leaves room for a workaround?

Random Talks on the European War

### A True Account of the Moscow Air Raid

On the fourth night, I decided to sleep in the basement of the American Ambassador's residence, and in the evening, I went to visit a friend nearby. The alarm sounded, and I immediately ran out of the room as usual and into the street. The distance between the two houses was always very close, but that night, the more anxious I was to run there before the alarm stopped, the more the street seemed to be endless. I was afraid I was going the wrong way. Later, I finally ran to the Spaba River Building Square, and I finally felt relieved. I rushed past the militia at the gate and entered the basement just before the anti-aircraft guns opened fire.

That night was very quiet. I sat on a hammock in the basement and chatted with Father White. He was an American missionary and had a church in Moscow. That night, he and I were the only two people seeking refuge in the basement! At 2:20, a servant came in and said that the alarm had been lifted. I parted ways with him. I wanted to take a bus, tram, or subway home, but since the air raid began, all vehicles had stopped, and it was already close to curfew time, so I couldn't delay any longer. I knew it was too late to go home before midnight, and I didn't want to risk being detained again, so I went to the British Consulate and called friends who had cars to ask them to take me back. But I was out of luck and had to use a sofa in a French priest's living room as a bed.

At two o'clock, the alarm sounded again, and we ran out again, carefully waiting near the air-raid shelter in the garden. This air raid was not very fierce, and at three o'clock, we returned to the sofa to sleep.

Until now, Moscow has not suffered major damage from the bombing. Although bombs have been dropped on the streets, squares, and apartment buildings, according to official sources, no military targets have been hit.

The more frequent the bombings, the less the fear of bombing. At first, as soon as I heard the alarm, I felt paralyzed all over, but now I can remain calm when I hear the alarm and forget the terror because of emotional excitement. Everyone has also become increasingly accustomed to the blackout and can gradually distinguish the night like a cat. Bombing has become a part of my life.

Most of the main foods have been issued with ration coupons, but the restrictions are very broad. I live in a hotel and don't feel any inconvenience. Before it was bombed, I held several dinner parties in the room. The menu started with caviar and ended with cranberries. Dutch wine, whiskey, brandy, wine, and champagne were all supplied by friends in the foreign delegation. Because they were unwilling to suffer losses, they would rather eat it all.

If someone told me that such a capital city would still have the time to make menus, sell decorations, clothing, and other irrelevant things during the war, I would not believe it. But some people are doing just that. But we will not easily forget the war. Several places in the city have changed. Two wrecks of German planes—a Junkers 88 and a Heinkel—are exhibited in the public square, which are concrete reminders. Soldiers often march in formation on the streets, singing loudly. Sometimes, soldiers are transported by vehicles and wave to the people. They are young and strong, and their faces are happy, which makes people feel sad and unhappy when they see them.

Several days ago, I went to buy flowers and asked an old clerk about the price of flowers, but he ignored me. It turned out that he was staring at the soldiers passing by outside the window, completely forgetting me. My face showed resentment. These people see their brothers, sons, and nephews sacrificed for the ambition of the invaders. Their anger and depression are naturally beyond my comparison as an outsider. (The End)

### Former French Military and Political Figures Imprisoned in Different Places

Reuters, Vichy, 17th: French leader Pétain, at the suggestion of the Political and Judicial Council, has ordered Daladier (former wartime Prime Minister), Blum (Socialist Prime Minister), and Gamellin (former Commander-in-Chief) to be imprisoned in a fortress. Renaud (Prime Minister at the time of the French collapse) and Colonial Minister Mandel will also be imprisoned in a fortified area. Former Air Minister La Chambre and former Armaments Director Jacqueme are still detained in Bourassol.

### Thailand Urges Readiness to Deal with Any Eventuality

Havas, Bangkok, 10th: The local radio station recently appealed to the people of the country, asking them to sacrifice their personal freedom to protect the country's freedom. It also instructed that after the German army wins in the Soviet Union, there will be heavy developments in the international community. In short, a storm is about to occur in the Far East. Our country must be prepared so that it can deal with any crisis in the future.

### German Forces Massing 20 to 30 Divisions, Attempting a Direct Assault on Moscow; Soviet Morale High, Showing No Signs of Weakening; Every Step Forward by Germans Exacts a Heavy Price

Reuter's, London, 17th - Reuter's military commentator states that the general accounts in Soviet communiqués are quite reliable. Therefore, the communiqué's acknowledgement of the deteriorating situation on the western front and the breakthrough of German tanks and mechanized infantry in a certain area has caused some anxiety. The Soviets did not disclose the name of the area, but it most likely refers to the Vyazma to Mozhaisk highway, west of Moscow, where the German offensive is the fiercest. It is noteworthy that the German command only claims that the battle is taking place 100 kilometers from Moscow, which proves that the German advance has only reached Mozhaisk, as this place is indeed 100 kilometers from Moscow. Even in modern mechanized warfare, this distance is still considerable, and the shorter the distance, the greater the resistance and obstacles. It is undeniable that the German army, relying on its superior numbers and equipment, is forcing the defenders southwest of Moscow to retreat. However, every inch the Germans advance will come at a greater price. Soviet morale shows no signs of weakening, and they are prepared to make enormous sacrifices, fighting for every house and every street in Moscow. Even if Moscow falls, it will only be one episode in the overall war. The current German offensive seems to be a direct assault on Moscow, but the Germans may gradually attempt to encircle the city to cut off reinforcements and supply lines from the east. The relative quiet on other fronts indicates that the Germans have concentrated all their forces on the attack on Moscow, which is significant as it may indicate the limits of German manpower and resources. The Soviet strength is limitless, and it is backed by a steady stream of supplies from Britain and America. The increasing flow of British and American supplies to the Soviets proves that these two democratic nations trust the unshakable determination of the Soviet people to resist.

TASS, Moscow, 17th - A strong defensive line is being built around Moscow. The Red Star newspaper states that Moscow must become an impregnable fortress. We will make Moscow indestructible.

Havas World News Agency, Berlin, 16th - A German Foreign Ministry spokesman recently told the press that the German government will issue a communiqué within days to explain the details of the German-Soviet war, particularly the battle for Moscow. When a reporter asked if the German war reports claiming that German troops had reached the outer defenses of Moscow referred to the vanguard, the spokesman replied that German troops had reached the outskirts of the Soviet capital and were engaged in a desperate battle with the Red Army. Although there are no fortresses or reinforced concrete defenses like the Maginot Line, there are still considerable fortifications around the city. Furthermore, the population of Moscow is still large and can be used to build defensive works. Therefore, Moscow cannot be considered an undefended city.

Havas, Stockholm, 17th - According to Swedish military observers, the ferocity of the battle for Moscow exceeds all previous battles on the Eastern Front. The left flank of General von Bock's Central Army Group is attempting to encircle Moscow. After capturing Kalinin, they may besiege Moscow along the Kaluga-Orel-Tula line from the north. It is said that no fewer than 20 to 30 German divisions are concentrated there. However, the Moscow railway and highway network is extensive, making it very convenient to mobilize reinforcements, and it is easy to defend. Although the German forces are superior, it may be difficult to capture the city in one fell swoop.

Moscow Highway Bordering Lines. Increasingly Fierce Struggle Between Sides

TASS, Moscow, 17th - A special correspondent for Pravda reported from the Vyazma area that on the 15th and 16th, the fighting was extremely fierce along the highway lines. The enemy attempted to seize key highway points. The enemy used more tanks and motorized units in the battle. They possessed an advantage in numbers, and broke into our defense lines. The Red Army bravely repelled the enemy. Our artillery also used fierce artillery fire to prevent the enemy from advancing. In addition to suffering attacks on the front lines, the enemy was also attacked in the rear by the Red Army. (This is because some Red Army units were cut off from communication by the German advance, and therefore remained behind German lines.) In short, the situation in the Vyazma area remains serious, but after our army took active measures, it has stopped the enemy's advance.

Odessa Still in Soviet Hands; Soviet Government Moves Capital to Kazan

Reuter's, London, 17th - Moscow Radio reports that Odessa is still holding out. Soviet forces are currently resisting the advance of German and Romanian troops. The Odessa garrison has crushed a regiment of Romanian cavalry and the 13th and 15th Infantry Divisions in a certain front line.

Reuter's, Washington, 17th - There has been no news here regarding the whereabouts of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt, who was previously in Moscow. Last night, a Reuters reporter learned from the State Department that there have been rumors that Steinhardt will move from Moscow to a location further inland. Another report said that Kazan, a city on the Volga River 400 miles east of Moscow, may become the temporary capital of the Soviet Union, and that important personnel from the U.S. Embassy have already arrived there. According to diplomatic circles, all foreign envoys and embassies in Moscow are either leaving or preparing to leave.

### Shanghai Municipal Council to Announce Price Controls on Daily Necessities; Establishing a New Agency to Seek Effective Measures; Setting Retail Profit Margins to Prevent Profiteering; Direct Procurement from Overseas if Necessary

The Shanghai Municipal Council has completed a comprehensive study of the price issue and will control prices and speculators to stabilize the lives of citizens. The various actions of speculators in the city have prompted the Municipal Council to take new measures. According to Mr. Fessenden, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, the results of the study will be announced next week. According to a Municipal Council official, the actual completion of these measures will take some time. At the next meeting of the Municipal Council, a final decision will be made on whether it is possible to adopt new measures to control prices. According to the English-language China Press, taxpayers in the International Settlement will soon pass a new ordinance authorizing the Municipal Council to control prices and speculators.

Establishing a New Agency to Combat Price Increases

The Shanghai Times reports that Mr. Fessenden, Secretary-General and Director-General of the Municipal Council, told reporters yesterday (16th) that the Council is thoroughly studying the possibility of establishing a municipal agency to effectively address the soaring prices of food and essential commodities. An announcement on this matter is expected no later than early next week. As for the continuous increase in rents, the Council does not intend to take measures to address them for the time being, as the Council has conducted a thorough investigation and has not yet found any way to deal with this "difficult" problem. However, the Council's policy for dealing with any event is not immutable and may be changed depending on developments. When reporters asked about the Municipal Council's position on various aspects of the current economic crisis, Mr. Fessenden answered some questions without hesitation, while others he answered after consideration.

Lack of Controls Led to Today's Situation

The reporter asked, "Is the Municipal Council also responsible for the soaring prices due to the lack of sufficient controls on manipulation and hoarding?" Mr. Fessenden replied, "Yes." He also stated that it is not beneficial in principle for the Municipal Council to interfere with legitimate private trade. The Council has thoroughly and sincerely considered the problem of rising prices in Shanghai and is now studying new ways to deal with the problem. He hopes to announce the Council's policy on this issue before the beginning of next week. The reporter asked whether the Municipal Council would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with the Japanese authorities in the city to allow food from the interior to enter the International Settlement more freely.

Focusing on Imports from Overseas

Mr. Fessenden replied that the Japanese authorities are well aware of the importance of supplying Shanghai. However, the Council is now focusing its attention on importing food from overseas. At present, the Council does not intend to extend its price control policy for rice to other foods, as it believes that the operations of importers of other essential foods are quite satisfactory and that their wholesale prices only obtain fair profits. The activities of retailers are a completely different issue. The steps that the Council will take to address hoarding and profiteering by retailers are included in the plan currently under consideration and are expected to be announced soon. If the Municipal Council feels that importers are not doing their best for the public good in the future,

Direct Procurement by Council if Necessary

then it will procure other foods to Shanghai itself, just as it does with rice. Regarding the rice issue, he believes that the Council has already taken the greatest possible measures to control rice prices. The reporter also asked whether the Municipal Council could investigate and set maximum selling prices for goods already stored in warehouses in the city, as it is well known that various commodities and foods are piled up like mountains. Mr. Fessenden replied that he is satisfied that the Municipal Council has sufficient and accurate information on the goods currently in Shanghai. If the Council can establish an agency to control retail prices, then the control measures will be applied to both goods already in Shanghai and goods about to arrive. Regarding the issue of whether the cost-of-living allowances given to employees by general stores in Shanghai can maintain the same ratio as the cost-of-living allowances given to Municipal Council employees, Mr. Fessenden stated that the Municipal Council is well aware that it is a public municipal body and must reconcile its responsibilities to both its employees and its taxpayers. Consideration of employees' cost-of-living allowances should be carried out simultaneously with price controls.

Retail Prices Must Be Set

According to the North-China Daily News, the situation in Shanghai is more complicated than elsewhere due to the overlapping of legal and political organs. It has been suggested that import merchants and the Municipal Council cooperate to report the wholesale prices sold to retailers to the Municipal Council, which would then formulate regulations to set the selling prices of various items, giving retailers a reasonable profit. It is believed that solving the price problem with more reason would be more beneficial to the city. According to sources, if the Municipal Council could come forward to manage the direct sale and control of daily necessities needed by residents within the Settlement, the Exchange Stabilization Fund would provide as much foreign exchange as possible for these necessities.

### Gasoline Expected to Arrive at the End of the Month; American Vessel Carrying Fuel Oil Arrives in Shanghai; Oil Rationing System Unlikely to Be Abolished for Now

An American oil tanker has arrived in the city. According to the Socony Oil Company, the ship is not carrying gasoline but fuel oil. It is currently docked at the Socony pier in Pudong unloading oil. When reporters asked a Socony official whether a tanker carrying gasoline would arrive in Shanghai within the month, he said, "We hope the ship can reach Shanghai." However, it is generally believed that even if the tanker arrives this month, it will not cause the oil companies to abandon their current oil rationing system. This system may continue to be implemented until the situation is very satisfactory.

### President Lines Far East General Office Moves to Manila; Rumors of U.S. Ships Avoiding Direct Routes Unconfirmed

The Far East General Office of the American President Lines, originally located at 51 Wuma Road, Shanghai, has, in view of the uncertain situation in the Far East, planned ahead and sent its Far East General Manager Mr. MacGowan by ship to the Philippines on September 3 to prepare for moving the Far East office from Shanghai to Manila. According to company sources, the company no longer denies this and admits that the preparations for the Manila General Office have been completed. The General Office will be located in the Philippines in the future, and Shanghai will only be a branch office. A number of important employees have also gone to the Philippines to assist in everything.

Direct U.S. Shipping Routes Unchanged

The President Coolidge and President Van Buren, which completed its maiden voyage to the Pacific, have recently returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. The above two ships will arrive here before the 27th of this month and have ample cabin space. As for the President Pierce, President Cleveland, and President Taft, the General Office has decided to rename them as General ships. However, rumors that American mail ships are avoiding direct routes from Shanghai to the U.S. are unfounded. The cause may be that the President Pierce was originally scheduled to sail from Hong Kong to Shanghai and then to the U.S. on September 27, but was ordered to stop sailing directly from Shanghai to the U.S. and only returned to Hong Kong after arriving in Shanghai to return to the U.S. The Shanghai office has not heard of this.

Hong Kong-Manila Flights Twice Weekly

Since the customs were closed, direct flights between Hong Kong and Manila have been convenient. United Air Lines has dispatched Sikorsky S-42 flying boats to fly between Hong Kong and Manila. The aircraft had already flown from San Francisco to Manila on September 23, once the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration approves, it can be implemented. Thereafter, the Hong Kong-Manila flights will be increased to two round trips per week to replace the Boeing aircraft that changed its route to Singapore.

### Coal Briquette Prices Set

Seventeen Dollars and Twenty Cents per Dan

The selling price of coal briquettes will remain based on the market price on the 16th of this month, that is, seventeen dollars and twenty cents per dan (50 kilograms). It must not be raised without the approval of the Price Evaluation Committee. The French Concession authorities have decided that the price of coal briquettes cannot be raised unless valid documents are provided to prove the reason for the price increase.

### Japanese Troops Increase Patrols at Hongkou Bridges

Since the Japanese army in the Hongkou district adopted special security measures, added steel reinforcements to the Sichuan Road Bridge, and set up fortresses in important places, they have also increased patrols at the Hengbang Bridge, Shikaizi Bridge, Zhonghong Bridge, Guo Hong Bridge, Waihong Bridge, Jiaxing Road Bridge, Tilan Bridge, and various bridges along Fearon Road, as well as at various wharves along the Huangpu River. In addition to Japanese soldiers armed with guns stationed there (originally there were two posts at each bridge, but they have been abandoned for a long time, and now they have been restored due to the implementation of special precautions), the patrol teams of the Japanese military police patrol back and forth from morning to night. Sometimes they also search vehicles and pedestrians. The purpose of the unprecedented precautions taken by the Japanese is difficult to fathom. The Japanese have also implemented the same measures in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Southern Shanghai.

### Hong Kong Post Office Expands Mail Inspection to Prevent Illegal Communications and Capital Flight

According to the Shanghai Postal Administration, the Hong Kong Post Office has recently actively strengthened the inspection of letters sent from Hong Kong. Therefore, mail sent from Hong Kong to various places is often received later than the date it should have arrived. A reporter from the New Courier learned from another source that mail sent from Hong Kong has recently been found to violate wartime regulations, involving economic, political, and financial matters, as well as using the postal service to attempt capital flight and communications that violate financial laws. There are also cases of privately sending banknotes abroad. The Hong Kong Post Office has increased its inspection staff and expanded its inspection work in order to achieve strict inspection.

### Meat Prices Fall, But Supply Remains Insufficient

The Continental Daily News reports that well-informed sources claim that meat prices fell sharply yesterday (16th), and the market situation has improved. However, the supply of livestock that can be obtained here has not increased or decreased. It was reported last week that frequent movements of Japanese troops in the suburbs of Shanghai hindered the transportation of livestock to Shanghai, causing meat prices to skyrocket to six yuan per catty. It has now fallen back to about three yuan. Well-informed sources also said that at the beginning of July, the Municipal Council's slaughterhouse, which was leased to the Japanese, retained only the right to inspect the slaughterhouse.

### Commemoration of Muhammad's Ascension; Muslims to Pray Tonight

Tonight is the night of the spiritual ascension of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. More than 100,000 Muslims in the city, in addition to their regular prayers during Ramadan, will gather in various mosques tonight to hold the "Qadr" evening service to commemorate the military. After Muslims in the city began fasting on the 11th of last month, they will break the fast on the 22nd of this month. Various mosques in the city are scheduled to hold breaking-of-the-fast ceremonies at 8:00 a.m. on that morning and will publish special editions of the breaking-of-the-fast ceremony. The Zhejiang Road Mosque will also hold a gathering of Arab friends with Hafiz Ahmed on that day. Mr. Ahmed has been engaged in business in Japan and has returned to China via Shanghai due to the freezing of funds. Muslims in the city have invited him to lead the prayers and recite a book of the Quran every night so that he can complete all 30 books of the Quran during the month of Ramadan. Because few Chinese Muslims can recite the entire Quran, this is an innovation in the city.

### Catholic Priests in China Must Strictly Abide by Chinese Laws; Changsha Diocese Authorities Issue Solemn Statement; Claims of Forcing Refugees to Wave at the Sky Are Untrue

The general representative office of the Franciscan Order of the Catholic Church in this port is shocked by the Changsha incident. Regarding the Reuters dispatches published in Shanghai on October 11 and 13, which stated that when the situation in Changsha was tense, most residents took refuge in the empty courtyards of German and Italian churches, and German and Italian priests organized these refugees and made them gather in the square. When a group of news reporters flew overhead that day, the priests ordered the people to wave at the sky. Twelve priests have now been expelled for malicious activities, and the status of other German and Italian priests in Free China may be adversely affected.

Diocese Authorities Issue Solemn Statement

The authorities of this diocese solemnly declare that Catholic missionaries must strictly abide by the laws of the country in which they are located and are prohibited from participating in political issues. Their work is limited to evangelism and charitable work. There are missionaries of 24 nationalities in China, and in addition to German and Italian priests, there are also British and French priests in the Changsha Catholic Diocese, and the representative of the association in Free China is an American priest. The alleged malicious activities are a misrepresentation. Moreover, foreign reporters flying over Changsha have never reported that Catholic refugees waved. According to Reuters, the Japanese forced refugees to move out regardless of the priests' protests.

Missionary Status Seriously Affected

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, Catholic priests in Changsha have worked hard in their positions, establishing Catholic hospitals and orphanages to serve refugees. All middle school buildings have been requisitioned for refugee use every day for the past four years. During the Changsha fire two years ago, the relief work of the missionaries was recognized by the public. On August 3 this year, the Catholic Church suffered a bombing, resulting in one death and huge losses to several church properties and hospitals. The nuns serving in the Changsha Hospital and the Sacred Heart Hospital of the Public Charity Hospital in this city, as well as the nuns who previously served in the refugee area of Nanshi, are all Sisters of the Franciscan Order. Their charity and amiability are admired by the general public. Now that the French, German, and Italian male and female priests in Changsha have been forced to withdraw, the charitable work of the schools, orphanages, and refugee shelters in the district is unfortunately affected. As described by Reuters, if the situation is serious, the future will endanger the status of other missionaries in Free China.

### U.S. Does Not Intend to Publish a Blacklist of Axis-Controlled Businesses; Shanghai Merchants Must Obtain U.S. Consular Approval for Orders; and Control Usage to the Greatest Possible Extent

The China Press reports that, according to information received by the British Ministry of Economic Warfare in London yesterday (16th), the German government has formally warned Nanjing that the United States intends to publish a list of businesses in China that trade with the Axis powers and prohibit American businesses from dealing with them. Therefore, the German side suggested methods such as prohibiting the dissemination of this "economic sanction" by using a blacklist of businesses.

No Dealings with Unfriendly Countries

Regarding this news in the area, a reporter asked an official at the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai yesterday. He stated that the U.S. government has not published a blacklist of businesses in China, but it is generally known that the United States has controlled the use of goods shipped to the Far East or other parts of the world, especially war materiel. The purpose of this move is, of course, to prevent these goods from reaching unfriendly countries. This measure is now being applied to Shanghai, just as it is being applied to other parts of the world that have trade with the U.S.

Shanghai Merchants Must Obtain Approval

As far as Shanghai merchants ordering American goods is concerned, the orderer must first apply for the approval of the U.S. Consulate, and the application must state the details of the name and use of the goods. This method applies to American goods that require an export license, and most of America's exported goods are already on the license list. The U.S. Consulate must investigate licensed export goods in order to determine their final use. The various sections of the Reuters dispatch may refer to this. Although there are no plans to create a blacklist now, there are some businesses that American businesses will obviously not trade with.

Cautious Transactions Based on Experience

The reporter further asked whether there was a possibility of issuing this blacklist in the future. The official replied that there is no difference between issuing a blacklist and American businesses knowing from experience that they cannot trade with certain businesses. The United States has issued a blacklist of German businesses in South America that are prohibited from trading. For the Far East, it controls the use of American goods to the greatest possible extent. This cannot be compared to the South American blacklist method. The U.S. Consulate is well acquainted with the businesses here, and all those who import American goods must guarantee that their disposal of American goods will be in line with current American policies.

### Japanese Residents Retreating from Little Luzon Arrive in Shanghai

Japanese residents from various parts of Southeast Asia, concentrating in Little Luzon to retreat to Shanghai to await ships to return to their country, have already passed through Shanghai in several batches. The details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that the French mail ship D'Artagnan, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, had 100 Japanese residents on board who were retreating from Little Luzon. The ship departed from Saigon this time, passing through Little Luzon to Shanghai, loaded with more than 8,000 packages of corn, and also loaded 1.18 million feet of lumber from Little Luzon. There were a total of 133 passengers. In addition to the 27 passengers who boarded the ship in Saigon, the remaining 106 passengers boarded the ship in Little Luzon. Some of them were not Japanese. Approximately 100 of the retreating Japanese residents. After the ship entered the port, it berthed at buoys 11 and 12. The Japanese residents disembarked in Hongkou, and the rest disembarked at the Customs pier. The ship will spend four or five days in Shanghai and return to Saigon on the 22nd.

### Bund Ferry Resumes Service

Since the Bund-Former Municipal Ferry was occupied by the Japanese, the staff suddenly went on strike a few days ago, causing the ferry to stop running. After a stalemate for many days, it was resolved after a 20% salary increase.

### Plumbing and Carpentry Strike

Workers in the plumbing and carpentry industries in this city have recently found life increasingly difficult and have elected representatives to negotiate with employers to moderately increase wages. After nearly a month of negotiations, the two sides failed to reach an agreement due to differing opinions, and a joint strike was launched yesterday. It is estimated that there are more than 20,000 workers in the industry. If the strike is allowed to continue for a long time, it will have a significant impact on society. It is hoped that the responsible authorities will mediate.

### Drainage Equipment Funds; New Bonds to Be Issued; Approved for Four Million Yuan as Temporary Expenses

The Municipal Council, in view of the fact that low-lying areas on various roads are flooded by rising tides or sudden rainstorms, obstructing traffic, has decided to allocate 4 million yuan for drainage equipment. Work has recently begun. However, given the Municipal Council's current financial situation, it seems quite difficult to pay the temporary expenses of 4 million yuan. The Council's Finance Committee has held several meetings to plan this huge sum and has decided to recommend that the Council issue bonds. The committee is currently planning in detail and will convene another meeting next week to make a final decision. If the committee decides to issue bonds, this will be the second time the Municipal Council has issued debt this year. It previously issued 9 million yuan in debt to make up for this year's financial deficit, and now it intends to issue another 4 million yuan in debt. Various parties have expressed great concern about the Council's move.

### Human Living Hell (Continued) By Bai Min

Within the Hongkou district, the increasingly degenerate foreigners are mostly Russians and refugees from Germany, including several hundred stranded sailors from various countries.

In a fourth-class tavern, this reporter encountered two American sailors stranded in Shanghai. Both were addicted to drugs. At the time, the reporter was sitting in a corner of the tavern, drinking beer, and upon hearing the voices of the two sailors during a few seconds of musical interlude, recognized that they were Americans. A moment later, the German refugee playing the piano energetically began a song again, making it difficult to hear what the two were saying. All that was visible was one of them calling a waiter and whispering something. The waiter went outside and returned a moment later, approaching their table and handing over two small paper packets. The two sailors took out some paper money, gave it to the waiter, and then ordered a glass of vodka. They poured the powder from one of the paper packets into the glass, and drank it down in one gulp.

Stepping into an alley, the reporter was grabbed by the arm by a Scandinavian sailor, begging for a dollar. The man was sallow and emaciated. Though standing he swayed a bit, he showed no sign of alcohol, so he was certainly addicted to drugs.

The reporter has encountered many Scandinavian sailors stranded in the area for over a year. All of them were addicted to alcohol as if their lives depended on it, and few were addicted to drugs. Just a few days ago, they had received their weekly allowance from their consulates in Shanghai, and they still had some money in their pockets. They all said, "Here, we can only have fun by drinking. Why not drink to our heart's content?"

There are reportedly over eighty Danish sailors living in Hongkou, receiving a weekly allowance of only sixty-five yuan from the Danish consulate. If they weren't sailors, or if someone took care of them, they might be able to make ends meet with this allowance. But they are all sailors, stranded in this foreign city with nothing to do. With money in their pockets, they only care about getting drunk, living one day at a time. Who can blame them for this? One Danish sailor asked the reporter, "Can you help us go to Hong Kong? Maybe we can serve on British ships. We all want to go, but the consulate has already taken our passports. Do you know any British people who can help us go to Hong Kong?"

There are very few Norwegian sailors in the drug district because whenever a Norwegian sailor finishes a stint in Shanghai, the Norwegian consulate finds a way to send him to Hong Kong to serve the British. Before their departure, the consulate provides for all their expenses, including food, clothing, lodging, and pocket money. They only linger in Hongkou for a few days and are eager to leave.

He bled profusely and collapsed on the spot. Nearby police officers, hearing the blast, rushed to the scene and reported to the Gordon Road police station in charge of the area. A large number of detectives were dispatched to the scene, and the nearby traffic was cut off for a thorough search, but to no avail. The Japanese bus had also sped off. The shrapnel was collected and taken back to the police station for investigation. An ambulance was urgently called to take Zhu to Baolong Hospital for treatment, and he was later transferred to Renji Hospital. It is reported that his injuries are very serious.

### Students of the Dago Vocational School Arrested

At 5 AM yesterday, four Japanese personnel, accompanied by police detectives, went to the Dago Vocational School at the intersection of Hankou Road and Jiangxi Road. They knocked on the door to enter the school. At that time, only six students were in the dormitory and had not yet gotten up. The Japanese personnel immediately instructed the tea boy to wake all six students and bring them out of the dormitory. The students were told to stand still. The Japanese personnel took out a photograph and, stepping in front of the students, compared their faces with the photograph. As a result, one of the six students' faces matched the photograph. That student was arrested and taken away in a car. As for the student's name and origin, the police authorities are maintaining strict secrecy and will not announce it.

### Student of the Lester School Kidnapped

At around 8:30 AM yesterday, Ye was on his way to school as usual when, upon reaching the front of the school, four kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the side of the road. Three of them brandished pistols and threatened Ye. They forced him into a bandit vehicle parked nearby and sped away, kidnapping him. After the police received the news, they quickly dispatched detectives to investigate. According to witnesses in the vicinity, the vehicle was a black-plated car and seemed to be heading towards Jiangwan. After obtaining the clues, the police are now ordering a thorough investigation. Around 10 AM, the bandit vehicle was found on Tao Peng Road, but there was still no trace of Ye.

### Drug Trafficker, Scared and Fleeing, Shot Dead

At 10:15 AM yesterday, a patrol vehicle of the Public Concession's reserve team was searching pedestrians and vehicles at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Mei Baige Road when a Korean drug trafficker, carrying drugs, arrived in a rickshaw. Upon seeing the detectives conducting the inspection, he became frightened and jumped out of the rickshaw, turning around and fleeing wildly. He was spotted by the detectives, who suspected that he must be a criminal and pursued him closely. Unexpectedly, the Korean man, while fleeing, took out the drugs from his bag and threw them away. The pursuing detectives, suspecting that he was taking out a weapon, opened fire. At the same time, another patrol team from the police station was also patrolling the area and opened fire from the front to stop the Korean man from fleeing. As a result, the Korean man was shot five times and collapsed to the ground. He was sent to Fumin Hospital for treatment but died soon after due to his serious injuries. It is reported that the deceased was named Aoyama, 25 years old.

In recent years, Mr. Chen has devoted himself to this art form, adhering to the principle of "not belittling the ancients, not clinging to the ancients." He integrates the strengths of ancient masters' brushwork, incorporates his own ideas, and emphasizes both form and content. His emotional expression is profound, his landscape painting is full of reclusive interest, and his techniques are refined and mature. Whether meticulous or freehand, his works are exquisite and masterful.

### The Enthusiasm of Fellow Students: Saving Pocket Money to Donate to Student Aid

To the Editor:

Currently, in any university, there are organizations of student associations from various provinces. Of course, we are no exception. We are a group of twenty-odd Minnan students from Soochow University. Three-quarters of us are from poor families, relying on the support of friends. Some of us even have to work after class. Therefore, we have held over a dozen meetings but have never enjoyed a "delicious snack" or "delicious feast." However, our enthusiasm for attending meetings has not diminished as a result. Everyone attends every meeting.

Because we are all young people far away from our hometowns, we inevitably feel "doubly homesick during festivals." Therefore, we take advantage of festivals to hold meetings. Each time, we save snack money and usual pocket money to make donations to help poor students or children. This year, we were very lucky. Relatives of a classmate invited us to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival with them and treated us very well, which made us even more touched. We proposed that, as in previous meetings, the transportation money that the classmates brought, the pocket money that was usually saved, and the snack money should all be pooled together as a donation. The classmate's relatives and the children in his family also agreed. We raised a total of one hundred yuan.

We have decided to donate this meager one hundred yuan to the Shen Bao Student Aid Fund for the Poor. At the same time, we hope that the hometown associations of students in various universities and middle schools can also contribute a portion or all of their social funds as donations. Then, that kind of strength will definitely be great, and the meaning will be very far-reaching.

Respectfully,

The Minnan Students Association of Soochow University

October 15th.

### Yarn and Cotton: The Japanese Cabinet's Resignation Deters Bullish Sentiment; Double Horse Yarn Declares Another Limit Down; General Observation Is That It Will Approach the 2,000 Yuan Mark

The yarn market has turned downward, and the situation is sluggish. This is because of the Japanese Cabinet's resignation, which has caused fears of changes in the international situation. In addition, the sharp decline in American cotton has dampened bullish sentiment, and the market is loosening. The market has turned downward. However, this time, from 1,750 yuan, it skyrocketed to 2,228 yuan, a huge increase of 478 yuan. Currently, the pullback could fall by half, estimated at 239 yuan, or even fall below the 2,000 yuan mark, which would not be surprising. As for current yarn transactions, they are as quiet as usual, so the prices of miscellaneous brand yarns are quite depressed, and even cheaper than Double Horse factory orders. The market price for 20-count Double Horse is 2,154 yuan, with a low price of 2,083 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, because of the cluster of sellers, the market declared a limit down, at 2,080 yuan. Outside the market, it was initially traded at 2,070 yuan, and then at 2,081 or 2,082 yuan. In the afternoon, the spot market fell by 20 to 30 yuan, and cloth was sluggish, dropping by 3 to 9.5 jiao.

Double Horse opened in the morning, and because of reports of changes in the Japanese Cabinet, sentiment suddenly softened, falling by 40 yuan. The first trade was at 2,145 yuan. Because those with profits were covering their positions, it briefly rose to 2,155 yuan. Subsequently, sellers were active, falling to 2,100 yuan. However, speculators re-entered, causing it to rise to 2,135 yuan. But the spot market price was not good, and it also showed weakness. By the time the market closed, it had fallen to 2,093 yuan. It is estimated that 15,000 bales were traded in half a day, still involving peer-to-peer transactions.

The futures market for Golden Double Horse sharply declined because of the reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet and the unpredictable changes in the international situation. The yarn market suffered an unexpected blow, and speculators were panicking. In the morning, American cotton plummeted by 70 to 80 points. The sharp tailwind from the previous night diminished. Therefore, the factory order market opened lower. Although it briefly rebounded, it ultimately resulted in a limit-down situation. However, the futures prices were more stable than the spot prices. In the morning, the near-term contract was at 1,910, the November contract was at 1,925, and the December contract was at 1,965. It briefly rebounded by 5 to 10 yuan due to the slightly firmer exchange and factory order markets. Ultimately, due to the unloading by retail investors and short sellers, the afternoon closing was down 30 to 50 yuan. In the afternoon, because the spot price fell to the limit down, sentiment was unsettled. Some powerful players took advantage of the low prices to buy the deferred contract and stabilize it. As a result, the near-term contract closed at 1,850 yuan, a fall of 73 yuan, the November contract closed at 1,892 yuan, a fall of only 53 yuan, and the December contract closed at 1,950 yuan, a slight fall of 43 yuan. Therefore, judging from its trend, it was entirely affected by the international situation, and the unloading by speculators and the manipulation of speculators. If the situation eases one day, those engaged in the market should pay attention to the intensity of the rebound. The following table is listed below.

### Indian and Vietnamese Cotton Arriving in Shanghai at the Same Time; Transactions Shift to Discussions Due to High Cotton Prices

The current cotton situation is that it has become sluggish due to excessive price increases in recent days. All parties are not as healthy as in the past. At the same time, American cotton has fallen sharply, and the yarn market has declined, which has inevitably affected raw cotton to some extent. The current cotton prices are listed on the left:

American Pungapore Cotton 100 bales 700.0 Haojiajin

Langong Flower 100 bales 535.0 Also

Also 100 bales 534.0 Also

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai: Lately, various parties have been eager to directly order foreign cotton, although the current inventory in Shanghai is scarce and the opportunity is very good. However, it is not easy to approve applications for foreign exchange. Therefore, only a few factories that hold foreign currency deposited in foreign banks can use it to offset the purchase of foreign cotton in small amounts, such as 100 to 300 bales of American cotton or Brazilian cotton. Otherwise, it is futile to call for help without a definite payment. As for the current cotton situation, it remains firm. Although the factory's appetite is not rising, the sellers' prices are too high, resulting in slightly fewer transactions. However, the transaction prices of Brazilian cotton between various colleagues for the 2-strand raw materials are all above 800 yuan.

Also, the selling price of fire machine cotton has initially increased significantly due to the increase in coarse lint raw materials. However, in the past two or three days, the market has slightly fallen due to the lack of broad demand from factories and the ample inventory in this city. In the past two days, the transaction prices between colleagues have been around 470 yuan.

The New York cotton market fell due to unfavorable European war news and the re-emergence of tension in the Far East. Large numbers of speculators were selling off and limiting prices, which were very intense. In recent days, Wall Street stocks have been falling frequently, and the closing prices of the cotton market have plummeted by 72 to 73 points compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to speculators buying and short covering, but subsequently slightly fell due to cotton merchants hedging sales. Finally, the market rose again due to purchases by colleagues and European exporters. Yesterday's closing prices rose by about 7 to 8 robis each.

Also, it is predicted that the market will open lower by about 10 robis today due to poor international news and a sharp fall in cotton.

The Taikoo Company's Hunan transport arrived in port yesterday afternoon, carrying 2,815 bales of cotton from Xianggang. The cotton is Indian cotton, transported from India to the port and then transshipped. Also, the French Company's Dadenan mail ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. In addition to a large shipment of corn from Saigon, there were also 3,517 bales of cotton, which were produced in Vietnam. The ship is currently berthed at buoys 11 and 12 and will move to the Shuntai Wharf to unload after the timber is cleared. (Zu)

### Finance: Futures Weak, Cash Rises

Yesterday, the gold market was mixed, with spot prices rising and futures falling, showing a diverging trend. Although there were reports of the resignation of the Japanese Cabinet, which was about to invade, cash dealers and certain banks, such as Xianghe Mingfeng Tianyuan Shihe, repeatedly entered the market. Hong Kong dealers continued to sell, so the price opened lower in the morning at 10,650 yuan, but soon began to rise. In the afternoon, it rose to a high of 11,020 yuan, but was suppressed by the heavy selling by Shunyuan. Ultimately, it was forcefully bought up by bill traders, and the price rose again, closing up 190 yuan. The October gold contract fell from 8,350 yuan to 8,130 yuan at noon due to the fact that there was a one-week cash delivery next Monday. Big players were busy closing out their positions. Only Dinglun increased its positions and Hengji competed to sell. In the afternoon, it recovered by 120 yuan in sparse trading, ultimately closing down slightly by 100 yuan. More than 1,000 taels were traded. Jewelry gold was initially priced down to 1,100 yuan, and then rose to 1,130 yuan, up 20 yuan.

### Black Market Foreign Exchange Transactions Turn Quiet

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw the Central Bank and HSBC both posting the same prices. The US and British exchange rates were flat at the small counters of HSBC and other banks. Black market trading of US and British exchange rates turned quiet, but the market remained relatively stable. Importers were hesitant, while Chinese merchants and private individuals were secretly still selling off their positions. After the market opened in the morning, the initial asking price for the US dollar was 3.625 yuan for sale, but at 10 o'clock, there were no buyers even at 3.75 yuan. In the afternoon, 3.875 yuan was a difficult to sell price, slightly firmer than the previous day. 2/125 (presumably 2 shillings and 1.25 pence) for the British pound still saw some buyers, the same as the closing price on the previous day, but no transactions were heard of throughout the day.

### Securities: The Rumor of the Collapse of the Cabinet Affects Securities; Domestic Bonds and Foreign Stocks Both Fall

The unofficial market for public bonds yesterday was affected by the deterioration of Japanese-American relations and the collapse of the Japanese Cabinet. Various markets in Shanghai were slightly affected. Public bonds were greatly affected, and people became more fearful. In addition, the "Chuan Gang" (Sichuan clique) also sold off, and Category C bonds even broke through 70 yuan to a low of 69.2 yuan. Fortunately, short covering was still lively, allowing it to be maintained. However, the foundation has become weak, and there are many changes in the future environment. It cannot be measured by common sense. Yesterday morning, Tongkang Xinhua Xinfu bought Category C bonds, opening at 70.02 yuan, rising to 70.04 yuan, and then Hongda Bao lowered the price to sell, and the 70 yuan mark was broken, seeing a low price of 9.6 yuan, and closing slightly at 35 jiao at noon. In the afternoon, the situation was still oversupplied, and Lianhe Shengda sold off consistently. Fortunately, Xie Xingyuan and Tongkang short covering were also very lively, and Zhongzi also had some buying, with a small price of 9.2 yuan, closing at 1.35 yuan. As a result, there was a uniform fall of 67 jiao to a force of 5.5 jiao, with transactions of approximately 1.78 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

Stock trading: 200 shares of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory stock were traded, with a price of 50.05 yuan per share.

The stock market for public companies suddenly fell sharply due to the resignation of the Japanese cabinet. In the terrible selling pressure, general speculative investors were mostly selling without price limits. In addition, with the weekend approaching, the evolution of the situation was difficult to predict, and buyers were wary, so the price fell as soon as it rebounded, ultimately closing at a level close to the low price.

### Food: Using Pretexts to Exaggerate, Rice Prices Rise Again

The imported rice market fluctuated. The early morning opening was affected by the deterioration of US-Japan relations, which was used as a pretext to hype up the market. Buying was strong, and both futures and spot prices of rice rose uniformly. Saigon No. 1 reached 147-148 yuan, No. 2 reached 135 yuan, and small rice flour reached 133 yuan, all rising by 2-3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. However, at that time, the Shanghai Municipal Council ordered a public sale of 2,000 tons of small rice flour, with the price up to 139.75 yuan. Sentiment softened, and the market price also fell. Small rice flour fell back to around 131 yuan. In the afternoon, there was still a meandering situation, and the small texture closed again between 132 and 133 yuan. It is estimated that the customer's hoarding of South stocks asked about it, Yinghua Si was loading 161 yuan to 162 yuan for small rice flour, the spot price was 156-158 yuan, which was more station and outer than the previous day, the volume of transactions was 15,600 packages and 400 tons. The inventory of foreign rice in the stacks was 1,054,026 packages.

### New Hoarding of Foreign Flour Rises, Market Wants to Stabilize, but Prices Rise Again

The actual sales of foreign flour from the North group have been sluggish, and the market could have gradually returned to normal. However, due to the worsening of US-Japan relations and fears that transportation routes would be blocked and that later arrivals would not be possible, a new wave of large-scale hoarders rose up to absorb the market, and speculative investors also took the opportunity to buy. However, those who profited also sold off, so the price increase remained stable amidst the rise, gradually progressing by steps. Fortune and Longevity brand was sold at 40.03 yuan, the God of Wealth brand at 39.5 yuan, and the Fortress brand at 41.45 yuan in the early morning and 41.67 yuan in the afternoon. The Golden Dragon West Stack was at 39.5 yuan to 40 yuan in the early morning and from 39.95 yuan to 40.13 yuan in the afternoon, all up by 67 jiao from the previous market. 40,000 packages were traded. Wheat bran, after profits were returned, rose to 42.6 yuan in small packages, falling back to 41.5 yuan, and closing at 42 yuan in the evening. Wheat had little buying or selling, and sentiment remained good.

### Oil Market: Selling Sentiment Declines, Oil Merchants Still Firmly Raise Prices, Resulting in a Rebound of 1-2 Yuan

The actual sales of edible oil yesterday remained sluggish and uninspired. Selling sentiment declined at the beginning of the early morning market, and many retail investors reduced prices to seek sales, so the market saw a fall of 3-5 yuan. Subsequently, due to many parties coming to raise prices at the bottom, the latter market regained momentum, and the results were largely the same as the previous day, rebounding by 1-2 yuan. Tongs Market sold 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 200 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 400 loads of Dayou Factory's clear oil, 300 loads of vegetable oil from the paint factory, 100 barrels of vegetable oil from the Ri Hua factory, and 500 loads of vegetable oil from the Lide factory.

### Sugar Market: Futures Prices for Coarse White Sugar Hit the Limit Up Again

The sugar market continued to rise yesterday. The Public Association set the plate. The spot prices for the February's import of coarse white sugar were 209 yuan to 208 yuan, 15 yuan and 13.5 yuan, 15 yuan and 16 yuan in the afternoon, then slightly returned to 10 yuan and 5 jiao, 12.5 yuan in the middle, rising by 6 yuan. August: 207 yuan to 12 yuan, in the afternoon, 214.15 yuan, from zero eight yuan to ten yuan, and rising six yuan, July: 205 yuan, 10 yuan, 212.5 in the afternoon.

### Piece Goods: Eastern Piece Goods Futures Very Weak

Eastern Cloth: Due to the deterioration of US-Japan relations, there were many rumors in the market, and people's hearts were very weak. Futures cloth followed the yarn market and fell. This month, the leading fine cloth fell by a huge 1.7 yuan per piece in the afternoon. However, the spot market price remained relatively firm. The closing price for the new Longtou factory order was 67.1 yuan, a fall of 1 yuan. The new order for Four Gentlemen's Serge was 2.43 yuan, also a fall of 0.035 yuan.

### Zhenhua Girls' School 35th Anniversary

Suzhou Zhenhua Girls' Middle School was founded six years before the Republic of China by Wang Xie Changda, a respected figure in Suzhou's women's circles. His daughters, Wang Jizhao and Wang Jiyu, returned from studying in the United States and continued the enterprise, making continuous progress over the years and earning a reputation in Suzhou. Before the war, they built school buildings at the former Suzhou Weaving Office, with all facilities such as libraries, gymnasiums, sports grounds, and science laboratories, making it the leading private school in Suzhou, with a student population of over 800. After the war, the school buildings were completely destroyed and the teachers and students scattered. In the autumn of the 28th year, the board of directors hired a new principal to re-establish the school in Shanghai, currently using the building at 1510 Aiwenyi Road as the school's location. Since its re-establishment, the school has already held two graduation ceremonies, and all graduating high school students have been able to pursue further education and employment with outstanding results. October 19th of this year marks the 35th anniversary of the school's founding. Although in extraordinary circumstances, the alumni, teachers, and students cherish the school's history and have decided to hold a simple commemorative ceremony on that day, with performances by students from all grades. In addition, letters have been sent to all alumni in Shanghai, inviting them to attend the celebration and discuss all matters related to the alma mater.

### Zhu Yuxiang Writes Zhu Zi's Family Instructions

The Haizhou calligrapher Zhu Yuxiang has been imitating the calligraphy of Jin and Tang dynasty figures for decades. He is devoted to the style of Yan Zhenqing, with strict structure and meticulous strokes. He is able to achieve a harmonious and peaceful style within the ancient strength. Because he laments the declining social customs, he has made a grand wish to write Zhu Zi's Family Instructions in regular script to indirectly assist social education and to have a subtle and transformative effect on social morality and people's hearts. The price is low. It is said that people have been flocking to Zhu's residence at No. 5 Jinchun Lane, at the intersection of Aiwenyi Road and Meibaige Road, to request his calligraphy.

### Unprecedented盛況 for Charity Basketball for Scholarship Aid: Blue and White Teams Battle at Paramount Today

Four Major Stars to Toss Opening Ball at 3 PM. Interlude: Movie Stars vs. Opera Performers. Hua Nan vs. Nanyang

The Paramount Sports Association of this city, to raise funds for scholarships for needy students in Shanghai, is holding a charity basketball tournament. Today will usher in another act of the tournament. The Blue and White teams, which won the champion title for this year's charity basketball for disaster-stricken children, will compete against the Paramount team in three major battles. The tournament dates are set for today, and next Wednesday (20th) and Saturday (25th). For today's preliminary round, to add to the grand occasion, in addition to the original Hua Nan vs. Nanyang exhibition performance, the Movie Star team organized by movie figures in this city, and the Opera Performers team comprised of professional and amateur opera members, will perform three special interlude performances. Today, Cheng Yanqiu, Tan Fuying, Yang Baosen, and Zhang Junqiu, the four major opera stars, have been invited to the venue to preside over the opening ball ceremony to highlight the grand event. Such an unprecedented event is not only rare in the past isolated basketball scene, but also a distinguished masterpiece for the currently deserted basketball world. The famous "three obsessions of Shanghai," basketball fans, movie fans, and opera fans, will all come together.

Special Performance

Movie Stars vs. Opera Performers: The movie stars are all movie figures engaged in work under the silver screen, and they are willing to contribute to public welfare and social welfare endeavors. The Opera Performers team is organized by professional and amateur opera members in this city and has accomplished players such as Xu Zhaoxiong, Lu Dazhen, Sun Junqing, and "Little Mengchang" Cheng Yize, etc., making them evenly matched. It is worth reporting that today, both sides will field a team consisting entirely of movie figures and opera performers, without "drafting" players from outside. In addition, with the four major opera stars personally tossing the opening ball for this event, it adds a great deal of luster.

Main Battle

Blue and White vs. Paramount are well-known teams to women and children. For this tournament, Feng Nianhua of the Paramount team has recovered from his arm injury and is determined to play today. The lineup of the Blue and White team for this match is well-organized. In addition to Wang Nanqun already returning to the team, Chen Bangzhen has also rushed back from Hankou. With Zhang Jinxuan still playing for the Blue and White team, it feels like adding wings to a tiger. The tension and excitement of this battle will be unprecedented.

Ticket Prices

Divided into three types: 100 yuan special honorary seat, 10 yuan honorary seat, and 5 yuan ordinary seat. After two days of pre-ordering and promotion, there are few remaining tickets. To avoid disappointment and temporary crowding, please pre-purchase tickets at the Paramount Hotel front desk.

### In Memory of Mr. Luo Wengan

— Ping Ye

Mr. Luo Wengan was a senior figure in diplomacy and a scholar of profound legal knowledge. His service as an official and lecturer moved both the North and the South. Upon reading the telegram and learning of Mr. Luo's passing in the ministry, I deeply mourn his loss.

Mr. Luo was known for his integrity, purity, and unwavering righteousness. During the early years of the Republic of China, when Yuan Shikai was attempting to restore the monarchy, Mr. Luo, as a law enforcement official in Beiping, issued an arrest warrant against Yuan for betraying the Republic. Due to the circumstances, he was forced to leave the capital. Such a spirit of integrity and determination should be admired by the people of the nation forever. After the success of the Northern Expedition, Mr. Luo served as Minister of Justice Administration and Minister of Foreign Affairs. During his tenure as Foreign Minister, there were many changes in the East, and there were many disputes over the Luo Wenyu region. At that time, Mr. Luo's younger brother sent a letter to Mr. Luo, asking for a position. Mr. Luo never wanted to employ relatives. Even for his younger brother, he would not make any exceptions. He immediately replied in a letter, which included the words "The Luo Wenyu incident is of national concern. Public matters take precedence, how can I attend to private matters?" Throughout his life, Mr. Luo never sought personal gain for his brother due to his own prominence. His impartiality can be seen from this.

As Foreign Minister, Mr. Luo wore the same long robe throughout the year. Someone asked him why he didn't change to a Western suit. Mr. Luo smiled and replied, "I studied at Oxford in England in my early years, and later traveled to France and Belgium. I considered myself a fine gentleman in a troubled world. Now, I have returned from brilliance to simplicity." Mr. Luo liked to drink alcohol. In his office, besides documents, he was accompanied by Shaoxing wine bottles and cigars. He often drank until his eyes were red and swollen like walnuts, but he would not restrain his drinking. His heroic spirit did not diminish with age. Mr. Luo held important positions several times and never misused a single penny of public funds. Mr. Luo's family was wealthy, and because of his involvement in politics, he often used his family property to make up for the inadequacy of his salary. Years ago, he once said to the writer that unless he was well-known, who would believe that he held an important position but still had to supplement his livelihood with his own property? We both laughed together. Later, Mr. Luo taught in the Southwest, and I did not know his recent situation. With regret, I suddenly heard of his passing. I have described his usual words and deeds as follows.

Unveiling of Trivial Essays, Number Four

### Little Pickpocket

— You Zuoxun

I Learned a Lesson

Before the war, Yangtze River steamships were extremely free. There were no registration procedures, let alone the trouble of searches. Therefore, in addition to genuine passengers, there were also a group of bad people such as petty thieves and pickpockets who specialized in stealing the belongings of "those traveling away from home."

I was returning to Shanghai from Hankou on a Taikoo Company passenger ship. The rapidly flowing river water pushed the ship forward like it was flying. It was an early morning, and the sun had gilded the water surface with a layer of gold. The light breeze stirred up the light waves, with glittering flashes. The smoke from the farmhouses on both sides of the river was curling up into the blue sky. I stood on the deck, gazing at the rising sun on the distant hillside. The rumbling sound of the "engine" controlled this quiet morning dawn.

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the ship's cabin. I hurriedly ran to the scene of the incident. It was a thirteen- or fourteen-year-old pickpocket who had been caught stealing things from a passenger's suitcase. He was grabbed like a chick and was about to be beaten. People around were persuading not to hit him, saying that the child was too young. Amidst the noise, the "deputy officer" came. He recognized this little pickpocket, because several months earlier, the same thing had happened, and he had been forgiven because of his young age. This time, the deputy officer was not willing to let him go so easily. He wanted to find a way to warn him. So, several servants used ropes to suspend the little pickpocket into the empty cargo hold. But the little pickpocket's expression did not change. He listened to them without concern. Soon, a little tune came from the bottom of the hold, "Sister, in the room..." This shattered the "deputy officer's" warning plan.

"Inspiration strikes, a plan comes to mind." The deputy officer went to light a "storm lantern" and tied it with lead wire to lower it into the hold. This time, the little pickpocket hurriedly cried out, hoarsely begging for help. The light illuminated his pitiful face, and two lines of tears kept flowing.

This is because the cargo hold, which had never let in sunlight, had long become a world of rats, centipedes, lizards, and poisonous insects. The little pickpocket, although in such a dangerous situation, was not unafraid, but the darkness around him had obscured everything. What was he afraid of? When the light came, it broke the confinement and illuminated every corner. He began to see the poisonous insects crawling. They were getting closer! Closer! Therefore, he shouted and screamed, hoping to escape danger immediately.

This is a good lesson.

People who are in a dangerous situation filled with poisonous insects, it is not that they do not know the danger, or do not think of escaping, it is just that the darkness around them obscures everything. If a ray of light is cast upon them, allowing them to catch a glimpse of the terrifying situation, then they will surely struggle to break free.

Military Equipment

### Battlefield X-Ray Machine

— Yong Yun

The most portable X-ray machine is the type specifically designed for battlefield use. It is now equipped in the American army. It only takes ten minutes to install, and it takes only one minute to examine a soldier. Its main use is to diagnose the location of bullets and shrapnel inside the body of wounded soldiers, because battlefield hospitals have simple equipment and no X-ray machines. More importantly, this type of X-ray machine does not require developing film. The location of the bullet can be seen immediately after the X-ray is taken. Of course, taking pictures is also possible. The stretcher in the army can be used as an operating table. The stretcher can be placed directly on the frame, and it can be removed immediately after the examination, which is extremely convenient for the wounded soldiers and without any trouble. (Editor's note: Please refer to Mr. Ke's article in this journal on September 20th.)

13. Drifting to Shanghai

Along the way, because the army was already being mobilized, the trains and buses were extremely crowded. In their small group, apart from Lin Sheng, a young man, there were two women and a middle-aged man who looked older than his years. They were carrying very little luggage, so the journey was very difficult. As soon as they arrived in Xuzhou, Qiu Haitang was the first to fall ill.

"Brother, Sister-in-law, it seems that you can only go first!" Mei Bao urged them automatically, because her father had been ill for four or five days and had not recovered. Lin Sheng and his wife had been accompanying them and were already showing a lot of anxiety. Looking at the news in the newspaper, the war in Shanghai had also started. She did not want them to be delayed any longer. "I heard that our army is fighting very well in Shanghai. You should go to Nanjing as soon as possible! As soon as Dad gets better, we will follow you to find you."

Lin Sheng frowned and did not answer immediately. "Okay, since my sister says so, then we can only take one step ahead." Meng Da Sao said with a flushed fat face: "It's not that I can't wait, but I'm really afraid that my parents at home will be anxious. I think they must have received Dad's letter. If we don't go again, the two old people will be uneasy. Sister, then we'll see you in Nanjing...!"

Qiu Haitang and Mei Bao really didn't want to burden them anymore, so they let Lin Sheng settle the bill at the hotel and leave first.

After the Mengs left, Qiu Haitang's luck was not too bad. She continued to lie in bed for only three days, and her illness went away by eighty or ninety percent. (239)

### New Organization in Shanghai: 9:15 Club

— Xuan

Membership Limited to Allied Nationals

When American new movies arrive in Shanghai, some of the best films are banned from being shown in the two settlements for political and other reasons, and movie fans are not able to see them, which is a pity. Now, the "9:15 Club" (Nine fifteen Club), organized by British expatriates in Shanghai, specializes in showing these banned films. The banned film "Escape," which was changed on the 16th of this month, stars eleven big names such as Norma Shearer and Robert Taylor. The wonder of the film is easily imaginable. I will briefly introduce the organization of the club below:

The 9:15 Club was only established on September 1st of this year, and a new film is changed every half month. All the proceeds, after expenses, are donated to the British War Fund. The club is not a for-profit private organization. People from Allied nations are welcome to join as members. There are currently 2,200 members of more than ten nationalities, and a campaign to recruit members is underway, aiming for a total of 4,500 people. However, the number of members is not limited to this number, and even if it increases to 10,000 people, it can be accommodated. Because currently, only one show is screened every night at 9:15 (an additional show is screened at 5:30 PM on Fridays for children to watch). If the number of members increases sharply, three shows can be screened every day at 2:30 PM, 5:30 PM, and 9:15.

Members are divided into three types: Basic Members, Associate Members, and "Guest Members." The entrance fee for Associate Members is 50 yuan, and the monthly fee is 10 yuan. The monthly fee for "Guest Members" is 15 yuan, of which 5 yuan is deducted each month and accumulated as membership fees. After ten months, they automatically become Associate Members. Both have the right to watch two films per month. In addition, starting from the first of next month, a "Tourist Member" program will be implemented. Basic Members or Associate Members are allowed to bring one guest to watch the film for a fee of 7.5 yuan per show. The show at 5:30 PM on Friday afternoons is for members' children to watch and is limited to children aged 14 to 16. The monthly fee per child is 6 yuan. Those who wish to join can obtain detailed rules and membership application forms from the East Building, 2nd Floor, 83 Beijing Road (telephone number 19212).

The films are screened on the 9th floor of the Cathay Hotel. The seats are comfortable, and the projector and screen are excellent. It is worth mentioning that Charlie Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" may also be released.

### International Chess

— Wei Han

Around 1918 or 1919, this newspaper published an article by Lao Pu discussing chess, elaborating in great detail on international chess. In the winter of 1927, Xie Bian published the second collection of the "Complete Chess Manual," praising this chess greatly, including diagrams and instructions for fellow enthusiasts. Furthermore, the "Great Beauty Weekly" once featured an international chess column, selecting chess problems from Western newspapers and promoting it. Recently, there are many who love international chess in Shanghai, but also quite a few who haven't grasped the basics. Therefore, I have gathered some information to provide a brief introduction:

International chess is divided into black and white, with each side having sixteen pieces—one King, one Queen, two Bishops, two Knights, two Rooks (or Castles), and eight Pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's King. The chess pieces are shaped realistically, and the chessboard is drawn with black and white squares, making it very aesthetically pleasing. This chess is roughly similar to Chinese chess, but the differences lie in the fact that the King and Rook can castle, and a Pawn can be promoted when it reaches the opponent's back rank. Also, the rule in Chinese chess where the generals cannot face each other and knights cannot be blocked does not exist in international chess. This art is popular worldwide, and the top player is Alekhine. He performed in Madrid, the capital of Spain, last month, and has now flown to Munich to participate in the all-European international chess competition, competing against sixteen international players.

Readers who are interested can send letters to this newspaper, which will forward them, to facilitate communication and research.

Brief News: (1) The Wenyi Society's box office is scheduled to hold the final dress rehearsal for the fourth performance at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association today, with programs including "White Peony," "Luoma Lake," "Female Escort," and "Jade Hall Spring," among others. (2) The Xiaolin Drama Society will perform the three one-act plays "Father Returns," "Female Ghost," and "Wen Tianxiang" at the Xuan Yi Palace on the morning of the 26th. It is reported that the performance will generate a surplus, which will still be donated to charity.

### Snippets of Opera Personalities

— Biography by Zheng Guoyi, Illustrations by Zhang Yizhang

(5) Hua Huilin - Hua Huilin was originally a female amateur opera singer in Shanghai. Her first teachers were Feng Zihe and Li Qin Xian. Li Qin Xian specialized in Qingyi roles, while Feng Zihe was known for her talents in Hua Dan roles. Therefore, during her amateur days, in addition to Qingyi roles, she already had a considerable foundation in Hua Dan plays. Hua Huilin's stage appearance at that time was charming and beautiful, with an enchanting smile, making her very endearing. Furthermore, when she performed as a guest performer, she often only used the name "Ms. Hua" without specifying her full name, which made her even more unique. As a result, the name "Ms. Hua" was quite well-known in Shanghai at the time and was often talked about. Later, she went to Beiping and became a disciple of Wang Yaoqing, officially starting her professional career. Hua Huilin can be considered a "pioneer" among female actors who went professional from being amateur opera singers from the South and gained fame in the capital. Hua Huilin could perform both Qingyi and Hua Dan roles, in the same style as Zhang Eyun, and her acting was pure, natural, and unforced. This lighthearted and casual demeanor was also similar to Zhang Eyun. They were also both from the South. Although there were still differences in their skills, Hua Huilin was indeed a shadow of Zhang Eyun. Since she forgot her lines while singing "Fen He Wan" with Ma Lianliang at the New Light Grand Theatre, and suffered a setback, her presence has been absent from the Shanghai stage for a long time now.

Chapter 18: Vow to Sweep Away the Huns, Regardless of Personal Safety

As soon as Ma Bao saw the two men arrive, he knew they were valiant warriors. Without waiting for them to speak, he asked, "General Wu has ordered us to quickly retreat the vanguard to Shanhaiguan and then defend the pass to repel the enemy, which may give us a chance to win. Therefore, we must withdraw the entire army tonight. You two go and prepare quickly." Zhang Cangqiu couldn't help but say, "We have already prepared for battle to kill as many rebels as possible. Now that the rebels are here, we are retreating instead. When will we be able to attack Beijing and drive out the rebel Li Zicheng? Aren't we disheartening the troops and demoralizing the patriots?" Ma Bao said, "Officer Zhang, what you said is true, but this is a military order and cannot be disobeyed. If there is a loss in battle, who can bear the responsibility? Therefore, we can only obey the order to retreat. I cannot say more." Zhang Cangqiu became even angrier upon hearing this and said loudly, "The garrison commander is acting on orders, and we cannot blame him. But we two must fight the rebels before we retreat. The ancients said, 'Vow to sweep away the Huns, regardless of personal safety.' We came here to join the army to sacrifice ourselves for our country and eliminate the enemy, not to live. If we lose soldiers or generals, we two are willing to be punished and will not regret even death." Chen Fei also said, "Retreating without fighting greatly discourages the morale of the soldiers. If the garrison commander does not intend to fight, we two will lead a small number of troops and imitate Gan Ning's white cavalry to raid the enemy camp. If we win, we will return. If we lose, we will fight to the death and never let the rebels gain an advantage. If General Wu blames us, we two will bear the responsibility." Ma Bao saw that the two men were so determined that he could not stop them with words. (195)
