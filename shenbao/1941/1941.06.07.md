### Japanese Army Plans Another Attack on Hunan; Chinese Forces Prepare to Inflict Heavy Losses; Battle in Zhongtiao Mountain in Southern Shanxi Temporarily Concludes; Chinese Army Shifts to Outer Lines, Utilizing Superior Terrain for Combat

Chongqing. The Chinese military spokesperson announced last night that the Japanese high command has rapidly concentrated its troops in Central China, possibly aiming to launch another attack on Hunan after the conclusion of the battle in Zhongtiao Mountain in Southern Shanxi. The spokesperson stated that two Japanese divisions have arrived in the area near 口, with others en route. These troops are partly transferred from North China and partly dispatched from South China via Shanghai. The spokesperson also said that minor clashes have occurred in the areas of Yuezhou, Nanchang, and Yichang, but the Chinese army is prepared for any offensive. The Japanese units that participated in the Zhongtiao Mountain battle have returned to their original defense positions, leaving only a garrison in Xuzhou Prefecture to protect the mountains and prevent Chinese attacks. The spokesperson added that the Chinese forces that have entered the interior of Shanxi Province have been engaging with the enemy since late May. The Chinese 27th Army and 98th Army achieved victories west of Changzi on May 27th and 28th, killing 1,300 Japanese soldiers. When asked about reports that the 18th Group Army had fought with the Japanese army near Beiping and in other parts of North China, the spokesperson declared that the Military Affairs Commission had not yet received any information about this matter, but he promised to issue a statement in two or three days outlining the government's orders regarding the Communist army's actions against the Japanese army.

Chongqing. Military news: (1) Several Japanese warships, carrying part of the Japanese army, forcibly landed at Sandu (east of Ningde) and Bahangyuan under cover of artillery fire on the night of the 31st. After a valiant resistance by the Chinese army, the Japanese were repelled, with hundreds killed. (2) The Chinese army fiercely attacked the Tailiang troops, inflicting losses on the Japanese. Subsequently, the Japanese reinforcements arrived continuously from Baotou and Guyang. The Chinese army retreated to a certain location on the 2nd and continued to fight. (Dispatch of the 6th)

Enshi. Since May 15th, the Chinese army has attacked Jiangjiawan, Ma'anshan, Xinjiayan, and Jigongling in Yidangwen, injuring or killing over 300 Japanese soldiers and seizing more than 80 machine guns, rifles, and pistols. Around that time, they destroyed 10 Japanese vehicles, 5 bridges, and hundreds of electric poles, damaged several sections of highways, and cut countless electric wires. They are currently continuing to intensify their attacks. (Dispatch of the 5th)

Luoyang. Although the battle in Zhongtiao Mountain has temporarily concluded, it has not ended. Those who do not understand the truth claim that the Chinese army in Zhongtiao Mountain has completely withdrawn, which is inaccurate. The Chinese army has shifted to the outer lines, and a large number still control the area behind the Japanese forces. Future combat strategies will utilize superior terrain and facilitate supply lines, with new measures being taken. Currently, the Japanese army in Zhongtiao Mountain is engaged in construction and road repair, with no other movements. Although the Japanese have occupied several strongholds in this battle, the cost they paid was very high. It is reported that recently a freight car, fully loaded with Japanese helmets, was transported north via the Tongpu Railway. These are all the belongings of their fallen officers and soldiers, from which one can infer the severity of their casualties. (Dispatch of the 5th)

Luoyang. On the night of the 29th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Hongfan, northwest of Xinxiang. They entered the village and killed over 20 Japanese soldiers, capturing over 10 rifles. (Dispatch of the 5th)

Somewhere in Southern Anhui. At 8 PM on the 29th of last month, Chinese forces launched an attack on the Japanese entrenched at Xiaomei Mountain, southwest of Dongliu. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties and retreated to the north of the mountain. The Chinese army took advantage of the situation to pursue and expand the battle results. At midnight, Japanese reinforcements launched a counterattack against the Chinese forces, but they were repelled after two hours of fierce fighting, suffering further losses. The Chinese army seized many spoils of war. (Dispatch of the 5th)

### Sino-British Credit Loan Agreement Signed: British £5 Million for Chinese Purchases

London. The Sino-British £5 million export credit loan agreement was signed on the 5th. In December of last year, the British government announced in the House of Commons that the British government, in consultation with the governments of related autonomous territories, had decided in principle to grant China a credit loan for China to purchase goods within the pound sterling area. People here believe that the conclusion of the above agreement is another expression of Britain's continued assistance to China and a testament to its confidence in China's ultimate victory in the war of resistance.

### Japanese Planes Raid Chongqing at Night; Urban and Suburban Areas Bombed; Several Fires Erupted

Chongqing. Last night, 72 Japanese bombers, divided into eight teams of nine each, raided Chongqing. The bombed area was very large, the damage was very heavy, and several fires broke out. This was the hundredth night raid of the year. Bombs fell in modern suburbs and urban areas. The vicinity of the Foreign Correspondents' Club was heavily bombed, with at least twelve bombs falling within 150 yards of the club, but the club itself was not damaged. The extent of the bombed area last night was unprecedented in previous night raids. Air raid shelters built on the mountainside were also hit by bombs, causing some civilians sheltering inside to suffocate to death. This morning, reporters from this agency visited the site and saw members of the Chinese relief team carrying corpses. The air raid alarm in Chongqing lasted for five hours, and the Japanese planes remained over Chongqing for about three hours and twenty minutes. The Japanese planes concentrated on Chongqing at 7:20 PM, 8:50 PM, 10:30 PM, and 10:40 PM. The first batch of Japanese planes dropped flares, seemingly to scout their targets, but the subsequent bombers used the fires that had already been ignited to find their targets. Residents of Chongqing were surprised by the attack because the sky was very cloudy when the alarm was issued at 7 PM. Half an hour later, the clouds cleared, and the Japanese planes flew over Chongqing under the moonlight. When the third batch of Japanese planes arrived at 10:30 PM, the anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, but the Japanese planes bombed quickly and left, returning a few minutes later. It is said that many bombs fell on the south bank of the Yangtze River, in a small village a quarter of a mile from the US Embassy. (United Press dispatch of the 6th)

Chongqing. At 7:20 PM, 9:15 PM, and 10:30 PM last night, Japanese planes bombed the countryside and western suburbs of Chongqing three times. This was the first night raid of the year. The first team of Japanese planes dropped bombs on the countryside, while the second and third teams dropped flares and then bombed the western suburbs, dropping many incendiary bombs. An office building was hit by a bomb. A bomb fell five yards from the Reuters office, heavily damaging the office building. (Reuters dispatch of the 6th)

Chongqing. Seventy-two Japanese planes raided Chongqing in batches yesterday afternoon at 6 PM. Residents of the city had received the air raid alarm in advance and had all taken shelter in air raid shelters in time. For five hours, the Japanese planes dropped many heavy bombs and incendiary bombs, and several houses caught fire and burned. The fire was the most intense near the Jialing Hotel, but the Jialing Hotel itself was not affected. Firefighters bravely fought the fire everywhere, and several died in the line of duty. (Havas dispatch of the 6th)

### More Than 700 People Tragically Buried Alive

Chongqing. Following last night's four heavy air raids on Chongqing by Japanese planes, it was discovered today that 700 civilians, mostly women, had suffocated to death in an air raid shelter. This shocking number of deaths was due to the ineffective ventilation equipment in the air raid shelter. Since Japanese planes began bombing Chongqing in 1939, this is the first time that so many deaths have occurred in this air raid shelter. When the United Press reporter inspected the air raid shelter today, he found the deaths in the trenches extremely horrific. The interior of the trenches were filled with corpses, resembling canned sardines. Several groups were families that were tragically killed. Their faces were twisted, and they were still tightly hugging each other. The entrance to the air raid shelter could only accommodate a person of average build. The blockage of the entrance and the ineffective ventilation equipment were the causes of death for the people in the trench. Rescue workers continuously carried the corpses out of the trench and lined them up to be claimed. This scene was truly shocking, and because of the hot weather, all the bodies had to be buried in the suburbs immediately, without waiting for their relatives to claim them. Rescue vehicles and transport vehicles loaded corpses to public cemeteries. As of tonight, officials have formally announced that 700 people died, 60 percent of whom were women and 12 percent of whom were children. (United Press dispatch of the 6th)

### Homes of the Poor Burned to the Ground

Chongqing. As a result of last night's first night raid of the year by Japanese planes, thousands of people were left homeless and slept on the sidewalks. The homes of the poor and small shops in the valleys near the west gate of Chongqing, an area of about one square mile, were burned to the ground. The scene was extremely tragic. In addition to bombs falling in the downtown area and western suburbs last night, several bombs also fell on the south bank of the Yangtze River. Both the American and Italian embassies were almost hit. Bombs fell in the valleys below the embassy buildings. About 700 men, women, and children, mostly from the poor, sought refuge in a large tunnel in a certain district of the lower city during last night's night raid, which lasted for several hours. Due to poor ventilation, they all suffocated to death by dawn today. The Japanese air raid last night was in three waves. The Reuters office was among the buildings destroyed by the Japanese planes. (Reuters dispatch of the 6th)

### China Urgently Needs Giant American Planes

Hong Kong. According to sources in Chongqing, China urgently needs American-made long-range bombers "to clear the sky of Japanese planes." Although the Japanese air raids on China may not be of much use militarily, they are quite detrimental because they can cause casualties among Chinese soldiers and civilians. A Chongqing newspaper suggested that the only way is to "fight poison with poison," which is a Chinese idiom. However, China cannot retaliate without bombers, because Chinese aviation personnel can only fly to various parts of Japan and carry out air raids if they have aircraft. The newspaper also quoted Senator Pepper of Florida as saying, "The United States should supply China with long-range bombers. These bombers, flown by American volunteer experts, will turn Tokyo into a Shura field." The newspaper, in view of the increasingly dangerous world situation and Japan's blatant threat to the United States, believes that the US government must adopt Pepper's suggestion without further hesitation. The newspaper continued, "The United States is currently promoting a five million dollar fundraising campaign, and the Chinese people are very grateful. However, if Japan is allowed to continue its war of aggression against China indefinitely, the need to aid China will never end. The only best way for the United States to help China reduce Japan's aggression against China and expel the Japanese army from China is to supply China with sufficient bombers as soon as possible. We hope that when Mr. Luce returns to the United States, he will make the US government deeply aware of the importance of this assistance." It is reported that Luce is the publisher of Time Life Fortune, and he recently brought his wife, Ms. Booth, to Chongqing. (International News Service dispatch of the 6th)

Editorial

### The Artificial Famine

It has been four years since the war moved away from Shanghai, but the general public's life in Shanghai is becoming more and more uneasy and difficult. Some people think that it is obvious that this is the effect of the depreciation of the legal tender. However, the facts are all there and cannot be explained so simply. At first, it was the wealthy who feared that the legal tender was worthless, so they feared that they would not escape quickly enough. Such as the initial foreign exchange squandering, the later gauze, rice, coal, and various hoarding, are reflections of this centrifugal effect. Generally, when there are many people seeking something, its value will naturally be high, and the amount of currency used will naturally be large. At first glance, it seems that the currency value is lower, but in fact, this relatively poor phenomenon is that prices and currency are mutually causal. If it is blamed on legal tender, it is either intentional concealment or not from the heart. Moreover, in recent years, the black market exchange rate in Shanghai has not changed much, but prices have risen more than in previous years, which shows that price increases are not entirely due to currency values. The reason for this is human manipulation, hoarding, and cornering the market. Secondly, the expansion of the European War, the requisition of ships, the obstruction of freight transportation, and the soaring water freight rates. Thirdly, the source of goods from various countries in Europe is becoming less and less, or even cut off, and the price increases under the natural principle that things are rare and precious. As for the increase in local goods, its impact on people's livelihood is much more profound and widespread than the increase in foreign goods. But if you want the people's livelihood to be prosperous and prices stable, it is not difficult. As long as the freight transport between Shanghai and other places is smooth and unobstructed, all unreasonable procedures and expenses are eliminated, and the previous state is restored, the supply and demand can be naturally adjusted, and there is no extra burden, and prices will be leveled by themselves. In the end, it will use its own agricultural products to supply its own needs, without any leakage, and there is no need to import high-priced agricultural products from abroad; it can also use the appropriate surplus to transship to foreign countries in exchange for the necessary foreign goods. All the calculation of prices in various places is originally straightforward, and there is no need for any intermediate conversion items. In this way, prices can also be reduced by as much as one time. However, it is easy to say, but under the current situation, what is the benefit of just saying it again? Because of this, speculative hoarders dare to be rampant without restraint, because they can use it as a trick for speculative hoarding.

If the situation does not become more serious, it can still be barely lived. It is like being squeezed more and more. It is not easy to eat meat, and it is not easy to eat vegetables. The current price of vegetables is far more than the previous price of meat; the current price of meat can be equal to the cost of a table in the past. The heavy burden makes life oppressive and breathless. The artificial famine is getting tighter day by day. It is clear that there is nothing that can be done, but this kind of thing is very tiring.

Although the current situation cannot be compared with ancient times, history shows that the masses automatically seek self-defense and survival, mostly starting from hunger. Qin's troops in the late Qin Dynasty, the Red Eyebrows in the Western Han Dynasty, the Yellow Turbans in the Eastern Han Dynasty, Huang Chao in the late Tang Dynasty, and Li Chuang in the late Ming Dynasty, which one is not like this? However, when we study its distant cause, they are all artificial famines, because of heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies, displacement and顛沛, farmers are not safe in their fields, and industry and commerce lose their jobs. Once there is a famine, how can they not take the risk? Even the foreign troubles suffered by Jin and Song dynasties, the disintegration and separation of more than a hundred years, and the suffering of the people, finally led to the unification of Sui and Tang dynasties, and the imperial cause of the Zhu family. Today, the people in the area known as the richest in the southeast are mostly struggling on the line of hunger. Not to mention other places, it must be even more miserable!

Fortunately, there are two concessions in Shanghai that publicly sell rice, which have been put on the market one after another. Although the people's food has not completely relieved the pain, it has slightly relieved the breath; however, there are many people who stir up trouble and cannot live in peace. Also, the price of briquettes is extremely high today, and there is still no way to equalize it. In addition, things like oil, salt, vegetables, and meat are not only not cheaper, but also more expensive every day. In a word, in the midst of various obstacles, there is only rise and no fall, not due to the abundance or shortage of products, but due to the result of a large amount of manipulation. The artificial famine is unknown to the bottom, and the people's livelihood in the future cannot have any hope of stability!

### Japanese Suggestions to the Netherlands East Indies to be Answered Within 24 Hours; Netherlands East Indies Adheres to Original Position; Negotiations About to be Declared Broken

Batavia. Yoshizawa, the leader of the Japanese delegation to the economic conference here, told reporters yesterday that he hoped that the government of the Netherlands East Indies would reply to Japan's latest proposals within 24 hours. If the reply is not satisfactory, then there is no need for me to stay here. I will pack my bags. At this point, my mission is over, and the Japanese government will not start new negotiations on the current economic issues. The subsequent situation must be decided by the Japanese government. Since I arrived here on December 28 last year, I have been treated with extremely kind and cordial reception everywhere, and have received generous treatment from the Governor-General. I have also had a very close friendship with Mr. Mock. I have tried my best to negotiate a friendly solution within the possible scope, and have discussed all economic issues between the two countries. Now we are on the cliff. Will we fall, or can we still be preserved? It will be decided in the next 24 hours. If the Netherlands East Indies firmly answers "No" to the main questions, the negotiations will end. If the reply from the Netherlands East Indies is unfavorable, it will have a very unfavorable reaction to Japanese public opinion, and the Japanese government is willing to accept the leadership of any other country. (2) Under no circumstances can the Netherlands East Indies directly or indirectly cooperate to supply raw materials to the enemy. The Dutch side has adopted this view from the beginning and has always maintained it. (Reuters dispatch of the 6th)

### Japanese Spokesperson Ishii Claims Negotiations with Netherlands Will Continue

Tokyo. Ishii, the deputy spokesperson of the Cabinet Information Bureau of Japan, announced today that Yoshizawa, the chief representative of Japan in the Dutch-Japanese economic negotiations, is scheduled to hold the final negotiations with the authorities of the Netherlands East Indies today, and said that the Japanese government expects to obtain the final reply from the Netherlands East Indies to the conditions put forward by Japan today. The question remains as to whether or not Japan will send an ultimatum to the Netherlands East Indies. Ishii replied that Japan's final conditions cannot be regarded as an ultimatum. Ishii also said that even if the reply from the Dutch side is not satisfactory, Japan will continue negotiations. The Allied News Agency explained that Ishii's statement meant that if the reply from the Dutch side is not satisfactory, Japan will not use force. Ishii also said that Dutch Ambassador to Japan Pasto did not hold talks with Foreign Ministry official Oohashi last week, and no future talks have been scheduled. (United Press dispatch of the 6th)

London. The Netherlands has officially protested against the statements made by Ishii, the deputy spokesperson of the Japanese government. It was announced in London today that the Dutch envoy to Tokyo has been ordered to make this representation. According to a Japanese news agency, Ishii recently expressed doubt about the integrity of the Dutch side's intentions at the economic conference in Batavia between Japan and the Netherlands East Indies. (Reuters dispatch of the 6th)

Tokyo. Ishii, the spokesperson of the Cabinet Information Bureau of Japan, stated that Axis diplomatic representative Afu and the Japanese Foreign Minister discussed the same issue that Matsuoka and US Ambassador Grew discussed yesterday. When reporters asked Ishii if what the German and Italian ambassadors discussed with Matsuoka was the same as what Matsuoka and Grew discussed, Ishii replied that what they discussed were completely different issues. (United Press dispatch of the 6th)

Tokyo. A Yomiuri Shimbun correspondent in Batavia recently reported that Yoshizawa, the chief representative of the Japanese economic delegation, said that if the Netherlands East Indies' reply to Japan's final proposal is still as unsatisfactory as in the past, the mouth representative will leave Batavia. The Netherlands East Indies has prepared to reply to Japan's proposal today. It was also said that Yoshizawa said with regret that he had asked Yomiuri Shimbun reporters about what he had said to them, Yoshizawa replied that Mock, the chairman of the Dutch delegation, had guaranteed to him that the negotiations would not be affected by British and American interests. Yoshizawa refused to express his opinion on the recent anti-Dutch East Indies remarks in Japanese newspapers, saying that he had not seen such text. He also said that as far as he himself was concerned, this trip was very pleasant. He has tried to improve the relationship between Japan and the Netherlands East Indies. If this mission is not successful, it will be "directly handled by the Japanese and Dutch governments." (Reuters dispatch of the 4th)

Washington. US government officials declined to comment on Japan's demands on the Dutch East Indies. However, there is ample evidence to indicate that the United States will continue to back the Dutch East Indies. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have held meetings with Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens for two days. Kleffens reiterated that the Dutch East Indies is very willing to supply Japan with reasonable amounts of raw materials, but is unwilling to supply excessive amounts. Experts pointed out that the US government has repeatedly issued formal statements on the Dutch incident, stating that American interests must be guaranteed by the Dutch East Indies being able to maintain its political status quo. Political observers believe that what Japan has submitted is actually equivalent to an olive branch, which is a simultaneous response to the Axis powers' attack on Syria, making the United States unable to take care of itself. Many speculate that Berlin has given this opportunity in order to make the United States timid, but in the past, whenever Germany has used this tactic, the result has only increased the determination of Britain, the United States, and the Allied powers. (United Press dispatch of the 6th)

Batavia. At 10 AM this morning, the Dutch delegation delivered its reply to Japan's latest economic proposals to the Japanese delegation in the building dedicated to economic negotiations. This meeting lasted for one and a half hours. After the meeting, Yoshizawa, the chief representative of the Japanese side, told reporters that he felt quite disappointed with the Dutch reply in some respects, but that each point could still be discussed. The Dutch representative said that it was not yet time for him to make an official statement. The general impression is that the Dutch side's views have not changed. Its views are based on two principles: (1) The Dutch East Indies is unwilling to participate in any order, nor does it say that if it leaves the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese government may restart trade negotiations, and said that these negotiations may be held by the Japanese and Dutch governments. (United Press dispatch of the 6th)

### Netherlands East Indies Orders 300 "Lightning Cars" from Ford

### U.S. Appropriations Committee Approves Huge Military Expenditure, Designates Special Funds for Manufacturing Various Munitions, and Authorizes Marshall to Apply Discretion

Washington - To cope with possible foreign aggression, the United States has yesterday entered the first stage of extremely expanding its military strength. The House Appropriations Committee recommended the adoption of the U.S. Army activity budget for the 1941 fiscal year, totaling $9,865,094,492. This unprecedentedly large budget in peacetime includes the purchase of an additional 12,856 aircraft, which will bring the U.S. aircraft production rate to an annual output of 4 by July 1, 1941. In its written report, the committee praised General Marshall's "extraordinary leadership skills" and stated that "it is generally recognized that he is carrying out a great work." General Marshall declared to the Appropriations Committee that the United States would make a major mistake if it did not permanently adopt a mandatory military training system. Knudsen, Director of the Production Management Office, urged a broad military program, saying, "We must never be caught off guard again." Connolly of the Civil Aeronautics Board stated that by July 1, the United States will have 100,000 trained civilian pilots. Peterson stated that by next June, the U.S. Army will have adequate equipment for 105mm howitzers, which are most effective in mobile tactics. General Marshall announced that in mid-April, the value of U.S.-shipped military supplies was $17,808,592, and from the $7,000,000,000 Lend-Lease fund, $1,800,000,000 was used for contract orders. The main provisions passed by the Appropriations Committee yesterday are as follows: $45,000,000 for military balloons; $771,896,000 for accelerating national defense production and canceling previous statutory obligations; $245,000,000 for engine parts and bomber spare parts; $141,249,000 for training pilots and specialized personnel; $65,000,000 for research and improvement of aircraft businesses; $402,400,000 for manufacturing new equipment and arming 1,800,000 people; $276,000,000 for Army and Air Force positions; $43,900,000 for civilian cooks, physicians, and other business staff. It is widely predicted that the resolution can accommodate 119,292 military officers and 1,563,908 personnel, excluding personnel from the Philippines. (United Press, 6th)

### Long-Range Guns Placed on East Coast, Army Rushes to Build New Barracks

Washington - Army Chief of Staff Marshall told the House Appropriations Committee that if the United States decides to send troops overseas to participate in the war, the first U.S. Army troops to be deployed will include a division that is "first to fight." This First Division is an elite force with priority, fully equipped with any new equipment available. Several other teams also have priority because they are also among those selected to be dispatched in the event of an emergency. The number of personnel in the First Division has almost reached its wartime strength and is currently stationed in Massachusetts. (Reuters, 6th)

Washington - General Somervell's statement to a House committee two days ago that the U.S. Army is rapidly undertaking a new barracks construction program has led members of Congress to believe that the Army Department has decided to increase battlefield troops to 2.8 million, doubling the current number. (Reuters, 6th)

Washington - The House Appropriations Committee is advocating for the allocation of $92 million to deploy new long-range guns along the Northeast coast, so that warships and aircraft do not have to undertake harbor defense duties. Coast Artillery Commander Green strongly advocated this approach, wanting to free up the Navy so that it can sail out to search for enemy traces and protect its coastline, while the main task of the Air Force is not to defend harbors but to seek out the enemy. (Reuters, 6th)

Washington - Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently announced that the U.S. Coast Guard has allocated 3,000 soldiers to be dispatched by the Navy Department, mostly to serve on troop transports requisitioned by the Navy Department. The U.S. Coast Guard has always been under the jurisdiction of the Treasury Department. (Havas, 5th)

### Authorizing the President to Requisition Industry, Congress is Engaged in Heated Debate

Washington - The issue of granting President Roosevelt the power to requisition industry is currently under intense debate. Republican Senator Johnson said that if Congress passes this bill, Roosevelt's power in the United States would be no different from Hitler's power in Germany. Colonel Stimson, the Secretary of War, denied that the bill would be used to exercise dictatorial power, and explained that the government, under the bill, would confiscate certain patents held by German companies, and certain important factory machinery and raw material inventories could also be requisitioned. (International News Service, 6th)

### Secretary of War Stimson Urges Congress to Swiftly Pass the Industrial Requisition Bill

Washington - Secretary of War Colonel Stimson yesterday urged Congress to immediately pass the "Industrial Requisition" bill requested by the War Department, considering this bill to be most important in aiding national affairs. Secretary of War pointed out, "On the one hand, we are not proceeding fast enough, and on the other hand, we are suffering from various obstacles." He also said that this move is essential to increase the production rate. He further stated, "The need for this bill is very clear. Under current law, we can only take over a factory if a manufacturer refuses to produce." Colonel Stimson also said that if this bill is implemented, we can requisition a certain factory controlled by the German government. He accused the German side of taking advantage of current laws to control many of our major industries. We can recover them by paying a fair price, but the reason we are not implementing it is because we are being hindered by forces that are desperately delaying our completion of preparations. (United Press, 6th)

### Aircraft Production Expanded as Much as Possible, Civilian Automobile Manufacturing Reduced

Washington - Director of the Production Management Office Knudsen stated yesterday that, given the requested increase in funding for aircraft, the U.S. aircraft industry should be able to reach a production volume of 50,000 aircraft in 194. The last batch of aircraft under the current program must be delivered by next autumn. The United States now plans to produce 160,000,000 pounds of aluminum annually to implement the aircraft manufacturing program. Last year, the production of aluminum was approximately 52,000,000 pounds. (Reuters, 6th)

Washington - The Production Management Office announced that it has ordered a reduction in the use of steel for manufacturing automobiles and civilian goods, so that steel plants can produce more steel for ships and railway vehicles. Knudsen, the director of the agency, had previously ordered automobile factories to reduce the quantity of 194-type automobiles by percent and ordered the steel industry to produce an additional 10 million tons of steel.

(Reuters, 6th)

Tokyo - The attitude of Turkey in the event of an outbreak of the Syrian war is of utmost concern to Nazi diplomatic circles here. Some people in Tokyo claim that Nazi Ambassador von Papen has asked the Turkish side to declare neutrality if war breaks out in Turkey. However, there is also a theory that Papen has not yet made this suggestion but will wait until the matter has indeed broken out before determining measures. Darlan's recent anti-British speech and the German communique mentioning the Vichy government have not been helpful to diplomatic personnel here, as the Turkish people are quite indignant about Darlan and the Turkish Adana affair. Several German business and agricultural experts recently arrived here but have not yet conducted negotiations with the Turkish side. (Reuters, 6th)

### Vichy Adopts Pro-German Policy, Hull Issues Final Warning, Accuses France of Willingly Becoming a Tool of Aggressor Nations, U.S.-French Relations on the Brink of Severance

Washington - U.S. Secretary of State Hull admitted yesterday that the Vichy government shows signs of cooperating with aggressor nations and said that the U.S. government has collected various facts regarding the Petain government's new policies for research. Hull's remarks on the issue of U.S.-French relations are as follows: "We have received several reports from Ambassador Leahy. Frankly speaking, we are very concerned about this situation that seems to be developing. As you know, our country has always been very sympathetic to France's genuine demands since its history. We have fought for France's goals, because France's goals are also our goals, because the principles of free republican government ruled by the people are the foundation of the democratic systems of the United States and France. Out of consideration for the difficulties France faced, for the welfare of the French nation and its empire, we showed France the concrete evidence of our sympathy and friendship. After the French government moved to Vichy, we still maintained full friendly diplomatic relations and accepted the French envoy to the United States. Regarding the economic issues related to maintaining French construction, we have given the fullest and most sympathetic consideration through diplomatic and semi-official channels, not only in the Western Hemisphere but also in the Far East. We have instructed Ambassador Leahy to convey to the French government our understanding of the difficult situation France is in, as well as our determination to do our best to help France solve the problems of its people's welfare. We have stated to the French government that our country's policy is to help Britain defend against the aggressive forces that have already conquered France. We have supplied food to the unoccupied zone of France, and the necessities for children are currently being distributed by the American Red Cross, and we intend to continue to do so. We have granted the convenience of passage to ships traveling from the Western Hemisphere to French colonies. We have cooperated with other countries in the Americas and the French government to defend and maintain the welfare and territorial integrity of French territories in the Western Hemisphere. In cooperating with France, we have tried to maintain the economic stability of French North Africa, such as providing various conveniences to keep trade flowing and allowing the people of North Africa to purchase their urgently needed goods from the United States, so that French North Africa can maintain its status as an integral part of France and its empire. Fortunately, whenever there was a need to implement these actions, Ambassador Leahy has assured the Vichy government, stating that the United States has no other intentions for any land in the French Empire other than to protect the French people. The United States' continued cooperation with France, which is currently in a difficult situation and whose actions are constrained by the armistice agreement signed with Germany and Italy, in a spirit of friendship and in the form of assistance, is indeed the determined policy of the U.S. government, but this policy is conditional on the French government guaranteeing that it has no intentions beyond the strict limits of the so-called armistice conditions. Now, although we have received this initial report, it is still difficult to believe that the French government could adopt a policy of cooperating with other countries whose purpose is aggression and oppression. If France were to take this action, it would not only abandon invaluable rights but would also immediately place France under actual political and military submission, and would further make this country, which has become part of the instrument of aggression, stand in opposition to many other countries and nations. If France were to take this step, it would directly be hostile to the legitimate rights and interests of other countries, not to mention the impact on the freedom, happiness, and genuine interests of the French people. Therefore, we are currently collecting as quickly as possible all the actual facts and circumstances that can provide insight into the actions of the French government for research," he said.

### U.S. Has Seven Possible Steps to Deal with Vichy

Washington - As a result of U.S. Secretary of State Hull's protest yesterday, accusing France of apparently deciding to adopt a policy of cooperation with Germany to harm its former ally Britain, U.S.-French relations have reached the most serious stage in history today. People here are speculating that Washington and Vichy may publicly declare a break in relations. It is said that French Ambassador to the United States Henry-Haye has requested an immediate meeting with Hull to ask Hull to clarify some of the key points in his remarks. The French ambassador is said to have decided not to publicly discuss the matter until after meeting with Hull. However, Hull's remarks have clearly caused great concern among French diplomats here. The U.S. Department of State is maintaining strict silence on the possibility of a break in relations between the U.S. and France, but observers believe that Hull's remarks contain a warning with the possible meaning of a U.S.-French break in relations. Political figures here are currently speculating about whether the U.S. will expand its recognition of General de Gaulle's Free French government in London if the U.S. and France do indeed break off relations. Since Vichy's policy of cooperation with Germany was revealed, the power of de Gaulle's government has clearly been increasing. It is also believed here that the recent surrender of Syrian French troops to the Free French forces is sufficient to show that the de Gaulle movement has at least a considerable playful nature. Well-informed sources believe that if the U.S. and France do break off diplomatic relations, it will give Britain a major encouragement and will be sufficient to stimulate an entire Free French movement, causing some French people who have hitherto been navigating between the Vichy and de Gaulle regimes to tend towards the Free French government. Hull's remarks are sufficient to show that if the degree of Franco-German cooperation reaches a point where France can be regarded as an aggressor nation, the United States will take the following actions: (1) Stop shipping food and relief supplies to the unoccupied zone of France (there have been no such shipments for months, but the shipment of two ships of barley to France per month has recently been under consideration); (2) Stop shipping goods to French Africa (the U.S. has already been implementing this measure); (3) Refuse to release $1,593,000,000 in frozen deposits (this move will cause difficulties for French diplomats around the world, as they now rely on this money for their livelihoods); (4) Requisition 14 French ships, including the giant ocean liner "Normandie"; (5) Recall the U.S. Ambassador to France, Leahy (it is widely believed that this move will cause the French people a very unpleasant psychological impact, as U.S.-French relations have always been friendly); (6) Completely sever U.S.-French diplomatic relations; (7) Take over French territories in the Western Hemisphere, or even launch operations in Dakar on the grounds that important bases have fallen into enemy hands, threatening the security of the Western Hemisphere. Government officials believe that the last three steps are most likely, and it is widely believed that taking over French territories is the most serious of these measures, as this action by the United States may result in war.

### Rumors of Serious Rift Between Weygand and Darlan, French Cabinet Held Important Meeting Yesterday, Governors of African Territories Participated

New York - According to a message from New York Times correspondent Bear, a serious rift has occurred between General Weygand and Admiral Darlan. According to reports previously received by diplomatic circles, Weygand met several times on Wednesday night and Thursday, including a meeting with General Petain, and also met with Darlan, and Liu expressed dissatisfaction with the cowardly and useless policies used in Syria. It is also heard that Weygand once told neutral diplomats that Syria had formed a mistake, but it would not be repeated in Yu's jurisdiction. (Reuters, 6th)

Vichy - The cabinet held an important meeting at 11 o'clock this morning, presided over by Chief of State Petain. All cabinet ministers attended, including General Weygand, commissioner of North African territories, Lieutenant Admiral Abrial, Governor-General of Algeria, Lieutenant Admiral Esteva, Director-General of Tunisia, and Puisson, Governor-General of French West Africa, who also rushed to participate, which shows the seriousness of the meeting. As of the time of sending this telegram, the meeting had not yet ended. (Havas, 6th)

Vichy - Political figures here recently said that government officials still focus on defending the French Empire as the center of their conversations today. General Weygand, commissioner of the French government's African territories, has not yet returned to his post since attending the State Council meeting on the 3rd of this month. Puisson, Governor-General of French West Africa, and Lieutenant Admiral Esteva, Governor-General of Tunisia, are both here. Officials are keeping silent about the content of the exchange of views among the key figures. Although the newspapers in the free zone of France have not mentioned the issue of imperial defense, the newspapers in the occupied zone have unanimously commented on it. For example, the "New Times" stated, "Government officials are now conducting talks separately to establish the position that France should take in military and political terms. In other words, if Syria is attacked by Britain, France must defend it. In June of last year, after its defeat, France did not resist Britain's invasion of French territory, but at this point, it cannot be the same as before. The events that occurred in French Equatorial Africa ten months ago will not recur in Africa or the Near East. In short, what France is currently concerned about is not the situation in Europe but the colonial issue." Those in well-informed circles claim that France's current European policy is to restore its status lost due to the defeat in the war, that is, in terms of the issue of European reorganization, it is currently under consideration, because France is in a special position in Africa, so it must also cooperate closely with Africa. Therefore, France's responsibility must be as one of the European powers, and it must possess colonies. The outline of this policy has recently been discussed during talks between France and Germany. (Havas, 5th)

### France Temporarily Remains Silent on Hull's Remarks

Vichy - Officials here have not yet made any response to U.S. Secretary of State Hull's remarks to the press. Political observers say that France's attitude has been clearly announced by Cabinet Assistant Darlan, that is, in addition to being determined to protect all colonies, it has no intention of aggression or threat against any country, especially respecting the United States. (Havas, 6th)

### Syria Supplied for Nazi Use, British Army Concentrated and Waiting to Attack, Powerful Fleet Forms a Formation off the Coast, Ground Troops Encircle Syria's Borders on Three Sides

London - The British Mediterranean Fleet formed a battle formation off the coast of Syria yesterday. British imperial troops are confronting French troops on the three borders, awaiting orders for a general offensive. British military experts observe that the attack on Syria will be ordered by the British headquarters to cooperate with infantry and cooperate with infantry. General Wavell, commander-in-chief of the British forces in the Middle East, believes that the position of the British forces has been strengthened compared with the past, and is now strong enough to act. Only Turkey is currently able to pass through the Syrian border, and the British military's first decision to attack will largely come from Palestine, but British troops are also stationed in Datan and other places outside Mosul (Iraq), ready to go. (United Press, 6th)

Beirut - According to widespread rumors overseas, in addition to attacking Syria from Datan and Palestine, the British army will also attack by sea, largely the port of Tripoli in Syria, the end point of the Iraqi oil pipeline. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

### Germans Steadily Infiltrate Syrian Territory, Three Important Airfields Occupied

London - According to reliable sources here, evidence of German infiltration into Syria is still increasing every moment. Although General Dentz, the French official in Syria, broadcast on the Beirut radio station last night, the facts are there and cannot be concealed. In his speech last night, the general condemned the rumors that German troops and German aircraft had arrived in Syria as crazy lies and rumors and warned Britain that France would treat force with force. The Free French radio station immediately refuted it, saying that all the hotels in Beirut are now full of German officers. General Dentz has even asked the Vichy government to send French people who sympathize with Germany, or even Germans, to defend Syria. The Syrian authorities have begun to repair and expand the airfields throughout the country under the guidance of German experts. Who is the general deceiving? News from other sources here also states that after the Germans occupied the Damascus airport, the enemy now controls the three largest air force bases in Syria. German aircraft are flying from Rhodes to Syria in a steady stream, and the number of German aircraft at airfields in northern Syria continues to increase. Another 500 tons of aviation fuel has been shipped to Aleppo by Hungarian ships. Several French officers suspected of sympathizing with General de Gaulle have been arrested by order of General Dentz (Reuters, 6th)

### British Strengthen Economic Control, Syria's Situation Worsens

London - According to travelers, the Aleppo and Palmyra airports in Syrian territory are now under German control, and all signs are written in both German and Arabic. London claims that Britain has completely stopped trade with Syria for ten days. It is reported that the governments of Australia and Egypt have declared Syria an enemy territory and banned trade. This will strengthen the economic control over Germans within Syria. Syria's economy relies heavily on trade with Palestine. Although Syria is under Vichy control, Britain had previously allowed some trade with Syria to continue to preserve Syria's economic vitality. Now, this assistance has been completely withdrawn, and Syria will likely face a serious situation. Syria and Lebanon have long been lacking goods and food, and the British Air Force's bombing of oil storage tanks outside Beirut will make Syria's gasoline problem even more severe than it has been for months. (Reuters, 6th)

Beirut - British planes bombed Beirut again yesterday, hitting the Shell Oil Company's oil tanks, which immediately caught fire. The city's fire brigade was immediately dispatched to put out the fire. British planes also dropped leaflets claiming that they had no intention of bombing people, but only wanted to destroy military equipment. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

### Germany and Italy Launch New Offensives in the Mediterranean, Alexandria Suffers Terrible Bombing, Italian Planes Raid Gibraltar at Night

London - Although since the fall of Crete, today's newspapers have ceased to mention the possibility of a British invasion of Syria, Syria remains the focus of public and official attention here. Some commentators believe that the Alexandria air raid on Wednesday is sufficient to indicate the beginning of German Mediterranean operations. They claim that since the Germans entered Cyrenaica, people have expected the Germans to attack Alexandria, and point out that in order to crush the British naval base in Alexandria, the Germans should first occupy Syria or Egypt, or attack both places simultaneously. They also say that General Wavell's Middle East forces may face an attack on Suez from both the east and west, and this has become increasingly clear. (United Press, 6th)

Alexandria - The Egyptian government has donated £3,000 to help the victims of the most severe air raid in Alexandria on Wednesday night. When enemy planes attacked on Wednesday night, they flew low over densely populated Arab areas, dropping high-explosive and incendiary bombs. One hundred and fifty people were killed, more than two hundred were injured, and many were left homeless. At that time, land and Allied warships concentrated their anti-aircraft fire for ninety minutes, and the firepower was extremely fierce. (Reuters, 6th)

Rome - According to an official announcement, a squadron of Italian planes bombed the British naval port of Gibraltar last night. (Havas, 6th)

### Romania Actively Prepares for War, General Mobilization to Be Completed Soon, Merchant Ships Used by Germany for Crossing

Budapest - News received here yesterday from Vienna states that the general mobilization of the Romanian army will be completed on June 16. It is also said that some areas of Romania have begun to evacuate residents, and air defense instructions have also been issued. (United Press, 6th)

Budapest - Hungarian newspapers report that Romanian merchant ships have been handed over to Germany for transporting German troops across the Black Sea. Furthermore, Romanian railway services have been reduced to increase the opportunity for German troops to use the railways. (United Press, 6th)

American Reporter Expelled by Soviets

Moscow - It was announced today that American reporter Scott, who was ordered to leave the Soviet Union yesterday, has been granted an extension of his residence permit until June 11. According to the original order, Scott was required to leave the Soviet Union within three days. (United Press, 6th)

### Standing Committee of the National Political Council Holds Seventh Meeting, Secretariat Reports on Implementation of Proposals, County System Advancement Association Not to Be Organized Separately

Chongqing - The seventeenth meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Political Council was held at 7:00 AM yesterday. Attendees included Chairman Zhang Boling, Zuo Shunsheng, Resident Committee Members Kong Geng, Gao Xibing, Liu Zhe, Shen Junru, Chu Fucheng, Chen Bosheng, Jiang Yiping, Tong Guanxian, Hang Liwu, Li Zhongxiang, Wang Shijie, and others. Regarding reporting matters, the Secretariat reported on the government's implementation of 14 proposals. Foreign Minister Wang reported on recent diplomatic and international situations. Regarding discussion matters, the Secretariat presented a written opinion regarding the proposal to organize a new County System Advancement Association as proposed in the General Assembly's resolutions. The original text is as follows: "During the first session of this General Assembly, there were two proposals regarding the new county system. After the General Assembly combined and resolved them, the resolution stated that the Council should organize a New County System Advancement Association to study the actual situation, provide opinions, contribute to the government for reference, and assist the government in effectively promoting the system. Upon investigation, the fourth group of this Standing Committee originally [unclear code] and other matters, the issue of the new county system should be included in the research. If there are opinions, they can be submitted to the Standing Committee for resolution and suggestions to the government. It seems unnecessary to organize another Advancement Association." It was suggested to hand this case over to the fourth group and not to organize a separate association. After discussions among the committee members, it was decided that all members of the fourth group would be members of the New County System Advancement Association, and other councilors in Chongqing could participate freely. The meeting adjourned at 8:50 AM. (6th Telegram)

### Finance, Tensions Rise in the Pacific, Minor Impact on Foreign Exchange

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed exchange rates remained flat across the board. The black market exchange rates for British and American currencies remained stable with a slight easing, due to foreign news of tensions in the Dutch East Indies and Japan's sudden demand with a 24-hour deadline for response. China Banking Corporation and speculators first sold off, but HSBC and an American bank absorbed the sales, causing the forward July US dollar to firm to 5.40625 at midday. In the afternoon, a speculator made a small purchase during the trading session, so it immediately returned to level. As a result, the closing prices of both exchange rates were the same as the previous day's prices, and trading was quite lively.

Speculators' Supply Slightly Stronger

Since the morning, foreign news indicated that the silver market, large bars, and Indian silver had all decreased, while the American market remained unchanged. Exchange rates for various countries, including British and American currencies, remained consistent and unchanged. The central bank's listed rates remained flat. Domestic banks opened with selling prices, and spot rates remained flat, with the British pound at 3 3/125, and the US dollar at 5.375. Chinese and foreign merchants all took a wait-and-see approach, and the market was stable. HSBC's listed exchange rates remained flat across the board. The silver equalization tax was reduced by half a percent, calculated at 23.75 percent. The July US dollar had softened to 5.375, making it difficult to settle. Around 10 o'clock, it was heard that China Banking Corporation, Mainland Bank, and others were selling July US dollars at 5.375 and 40625 to HSBC, and due to negative rumors, speculators' willingness to supply suddenly improved, selling July at 5.40625. Therefore, by noon, the closing price had firmed to the above-mentioned price for settlement, with the spot rate remaining flat at 5.375, and the British pound at 3 2/125.

Afternoon Situation Turns Stable

In the afternoon, Chinese merchants and speculators made small purchases of July at 5.40625, but immediately returned to level, making it difficult to sell.

### Gold Market Slips Slightly

Yesterday's black market in gold saw weak fluctuations. The underlying trend was first up, then down, due to rumors at midday that Japan had made demands to the Dutch East Indies authorities with a 24-hour response deadline, and the distant month US dollar turned from slightly tight to loose. Everyone was confused and mostly turned tired. After opening in the morning, cash dealers and general scalpers actively pushed up the price, which once rose to 6,457 yuan. Near noon, rumors (one saying Reuters) spread that the distant month US dollar could be settled at 5.40625 yuan, and money changers stopped buying. Securities firms and exchange brokers successively sold off, causing the price to retreat to 6,432 yuan. After Xiangxing Yong made active purchases, the decline stopped. In the afternoon, the price fluctuated around 6,440 yuan, with a difference of only seven yuan. The final net decrease was only five yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 15,600 taels. Cash transactions increased. Fei Wenyuan sold 100 taels at a price 285 yuan higher than the futures price. Decheng sold 70 taels, 280 yuan higher, both purchased by Xianghe. Xinyuan sold 20 taels, and Hesheng sold 30 taels, purchased by Shihe, at 280 yuan higher. The afternoon price was 285 yuan higher, and there was no news of openings. This was a small number of yuan less than the previous day. Jewelry gold and customs gold remained flat.

Futures Fall by Only Five Yuan

Since the opening at 9:15 AM, each bar (ten taels) was priced at 6,448 yuan, higher than the previous day's closing price. Subsequently, different accounts had different entrances and exits, so it rose from 6,445 yuan to 6,450 yuan. Gongda and Dafeng actively sold, retreating to 6,442 yuan. Because the near-month US dollar was difficult to settle at 5.375 yuan, Jufeng Yong, Decheng, Gongda, and Shihe actively purchased, and the price rose 15 yuan to reach 6,457 yuan. The market remained around 6,450 yuan for a long time. As rumors spread, the market situation changed from firm to tired. Decheng came out again, and Xinfeng Yong, Chengji, Tong Kangyong, and Defu all sold, causing the price to retreat to 6,432 yuan. Xiangxing Yong actively purchased to 6,445 yuan. Xinfeng Yong sold again. The midday closing price was 6,437 yuan, and after closing, 6,432 yuan. The opening price at 2:00 PM in the afternoon was 6,425 yuan, a decrease of several yuan. Yili and Chengji bought, rising to 6,440 yuan. Xianghe sold, retreating to 6,427 yuan. Because scattered accounts entered slightly, the price rose again to 6,442 yuan. The closing price at 3:30 PM was 6,441 yuan, five yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. The settlement price based on the June US dollar at 5.375 yuan was 6,479 yuan, a difference of 38 yuan. The difference that day was only 25 yuan. The listed gold price of the cash dealer was 300 yuan higher than the spot futures price, and the purchase price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for the current margin.

No Changes in Jewelry Gold

The selling price of silver building jewelry gold was still listed at 695 yuan per tael by Datongxing and Xintongxing, with a reduction of 40 yuan for purchases and no changes.

Japanese and Korean Ticket Fall Spreads

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a slight decline in both spot and futures for spot gold. The British and American gold pounds also decreased by one yuan each. The British gold ticket remained stagnant and the market price remained flat. The American gold ticket continued to hover within a narrow range and ultimately fell by three cents. Supply and demand for the Hong Kong ticket were even, and the market price remained flat. The drop in Japanese and Korean tickets spread, with the former retreating to 1.91 yuan and the latter falling to 1.61 yuan.

### Securities, Government Bonds Rise

In the government bond black market, the bullish trend intensified yesterday. Various bears rushed to cover their positions and buy. The reasons for the increase pointed out by this newspaper have been tacitly accepted by the general public, and market rumors are all based on these reasons. Looking at the various buyers yesterday, many were absorbed by the financial sector, so there is still a possibility of continued upward trends in the future. In the morning, Defu, Tongshun, Qianyi, and Changkang made purchases. Xinhua and Hengkang added to their positions, and Dingkang bought Class A bonds, which can be said to be a good choice. Tongkang and Lianyi sold their positions, Xie Kang and Yichang sold off, and Jiufeng also sold quite a bit. The midday closing was good by three to five jiao. In the afternoon, sentiment became more excited, and various dealers were absorbing positions on behalf of the financial sector. Changfu, Tongji, and Defu in the northern gang all absorbed positions, and Yuxing and Shengda added to their positions again. Gongmao, Fuxing, and Yongkang also made purchases. Although Tongkang and Xie Da sold off in large quantities, the market price actually rose slowly. Lianyi, Xinhua, Yitai, and Jiufeng still sold, but the price rose even more sharply. Class C bonds even broke through nine yuan, Class B bonds broke through 71 yuan, Class A bonds broke through the eight-yuan mark, Class E bonds also reached over eight yuan, and Class D bonds also traded at seven yuan. The goodness of the market atmosphere can be imagined. As a result, the market continued to rise by 95 cents to 1.3 yuan, with a total transaction volume of three million two hundred thousand yuan. A brief summary is listed below.

In stock trading, 30 shares of Huacheng Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 59.5 yuan.

The stock market of the Public Industry Association was more active. The opening trend was very firm, but it turned soft again until closing. Wheelock Marden opened at 95 yuan, reaching a high of 96 yuan, but quickly fell to 94.5 yuan at closing. Rubber stocks all declined, due to news of the tense situation in the Dutch East Indies.

### Yarn and Cotton, Double Horse Futures and Spot Prices Rise First, Then Fall Back

The yarn market, which had rebounded in the afternoon of the previous day, returned to calm yesterday. However, the factories are still taking in factory orders and rumors are spreading about the release of spot yarn, so the opening momentum was relatively strong. Although there was no development of wholesale transactions in spot yarn trading, sporadic purchases continued. The Hong Kong gang bought 350 bales of coarse and fine yarn, but demand from other gangs remained silent. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,436 yuan, and the low price was 1,427 yuan. The initial opening price in the afternoon was 1,425 yuan, rising to 1,428 yuan, but transactions were very light, so the up-and-down range was narrow. The final price was 1,427 yuan. Currently, the yarn market has not escaped the revolving environment, and there may be no new developments for the time being. Today, 1,655 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened in the morning, continuing the popularity of the afternoon of the previous day, and the price rose. Most were inclined to sell, so the first round opened at 1,435 yuan, and sellers were numerous. After a short while, it rose slightly to 1,436 yuan, but the bulls on the floor struggled very hard. Because the margin was very high, it remained at 1,433-4 yuan for a long time. Afterwards, hearing the market conditions of the exchange, the second round fell back, the margin was average, and customers' actual sales were not smooth. The momentum suddenly softened, closing at 1,426 yuan. A statistical total of 6,350 bales were traded in the morning. The amounts bought by each gang are listed on the left.

Hong Kong 350, Same trade 6,000

Total 6,350

The situation of the Jin Double Horse standard yarn was good in the morning and continued to rise. It then became tired due to some profit-taking, but the momentum was still stable. However, it gradually declined in the afternoon and only became stable at closing. As a result, the July contract fell by 3.5 yuan compared to the previous day, and the August contract fell by 7 yuan. The transaction volume in the morning was 3,000 bales, and in the afternoon more than 2,000 bales. The total daily transaction volume was 5,000 bales. The high and low prices during the day are listed on the left (the prices opened by the exchange are net bid prices, plus unified tax).

Morning Afternoon

July Open 1380.0 1373.0 Close 1378.0 1372.4

Daily High 1380.0 Low 1371.0

August Open 1390.0 1382.0 Close 1383.0 1382.0

Daily High 1390.0 Low 1381.0

### Coarse and Fine Velvet Cotton, Factories' Appetite Is Good

The spot cotton situation is stable as usual. Factories' transactions in fine velvet cotton continue, and the trend is upward. Chinese factories' transactions in raw materials for 10-count coarse yarn are also good, so the cotton market is firm.

Brazilian Cotton 413 No. 22 pieces, delivered at the warehouse

Middling 426 Another 100 pieces, another

Another 428 Another 10 pieces, another

Indian N.T. 389 Another 97 pieces, another

Also, foreign cotton transactions by foreign firms in Shanghai are fairly lively. Both traders and factories have a desire to purchase, because the yarn market is gradually turning around and the international situation is conducive to bulls, so the cotton market may have good development.

The New York cotton market was calm and unchanged in the early morning, but later it suddenly fell due to bull profit-taking and selling by the Southern gang. As a result, the closing price was four or five points lower than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to scattered purchases, then fell due to some bull profit-taking. Yesterday's closing price rose or fell one or two rupees, small difference.

The market is also predicted to open lower by half a rupee today.

### Piece Goods, Cloths Rise

Factory Cloth: The market trend was stable yesterday. The rise in some coarse cloth was especially sharp, because the Nanyang gang continued to search for goods, and the Shandong gang in the northern route also had needs. As a result, light and heavy weight rose by 50 to 75 cents per piece. The rising force of fine cloth and twill was weak, with some increasing by 25 cents. The opening price of bleached and dyed cloth also varied. The street's transaction volume was over 300 pieces of greige, light-colored printed cloths. The Cantonese and Hong Kong gang bought over 200 pieces of blue cloth, color twill, etc. The Nanyang gang bought over 200 pieces of Yizu coarse cloth and bleached and dyed cloth. The Yanjing gang in the northern route bought over 100 pieces of light and heavy weight coarse cloth. Today, 2,410 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, the futures market for fine cloth on the exchange fell back by 40-50 cents per piece, while the spot market saw slightly more movement in actual sales, and morale improved. The factory closing price for longtou fine cloth was 44.9 yuan, a slight decrease of only one cent. The price of the four gentlemen's billis color goods was very tight, revolving around 1.44 yuan, and the market situation remained firm.

### Grains, Overseas Rice Transport and Sales Gradually Become Smooth, Javanese Rice Arrives in Shanghai Again

Although the overseas rice market rises and falls suddenly, it has not been smooth. However, the supply and demand law regarding rises and falls in production and sales seems to have entered the track. The prices had risen after initial weakness, but ultimately fell back. As a result, the prices were similar to the closing prices of the previous day. When the market opened in the morning, as Hong Kong and Vietnamese rice continued to be transported and supplied, and the producing areas also saw lower prices and easier transport, Chinese and foreign merchants were selling off, and market prices followed people's sentiment downward. Subsequently, actual sales were active, especially in Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Pudong in the inland, with each group buying 5,000 to 6,000 bags. The market price immediately rose by two to three yuan. After the rise, hoarders released their goods, and new transactions were also thrown out by Duf. 500 tons of small-grain are about to be loaded, priced at 134 yuan. Xinchang Sheng Cha has 1,000 tons of June small-grain, priced at 133 yuan. Other batches are also being negotiated. Returning Yinhua Company's (one dan, two and a half dou) small-grain is now opening at 135.5 to 135 yuan. Futures have dropped from 135 yuan to 134 yuan and 133.57 yuan. Broken rice has dropped to 102.5 yuan. No. 1 Saigon spot is also opening at 137 yuan, but there are no takers. The total daily transaction volume for Yinhua Company was no less than 1,500 tons, and there were more than 10,000 bags of spot rice. Javanese overseas rice has arrived in Shanghai again, with excellent quality, white color, and large grains, similar to domestic rice. A lot of it has been transported in the past. Yesterday, the Chava Mailboat Company's Zhini Kana arrived in Shanghai, transporting 900 tons of Javanese rice, about 9,000 bags. 350 tons of corn were also transported, totaling about 3,500 bags, and berthed at the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. This corn will be transferred to North China in the future. (Zu)

Although the arrival of thick and thin Japonica domestic rice is sparse, the mold season is approaching, the weather is hot and humid, and rice is prone to spoilage and cannot withstand accumulation. Sellers' intentions are relaxed, and sales are sluggish, so the market has declined by one or two yuan. Fresh early and late rice from Nangang is priced at 135 yuan, secondary rice at 132 yuan, and stale rice at 130 yuan. As for thick Japonica rice, it seems to be out of season, with only some stale and hot goods on the market, resulting in low quality and cheap prices, and the market is out of standard. The original bag only sells for 120 yuan, and a "hu" sells for 118 yuan.

Glutinous rice has not arrived for a long time, and the amount of goods on the market is scarce. Hoarders' minds are firm, and the sporadic sales to rice porters and cake shops have been smooth in recent days, so the selling price continues to be beautiful, rising by one or two yuan. Hong Kong white yuan is priced at 113-4 yuan, special group material is priced at 116 yuan, glutinous mung bean is priced at 105-6 yuan, and domestic glutinous rice is priced at 122 yuan, 120 yuan.

### Flour Market Slightly Firmer in the Afternoon

Overseas flour trading continues to be slack. The market lacks the strength to rise. Jinlong brand Kant powder opened at 28 to 28.3 yuan, and Huaniaopai Australian powder opened at 29.2 yuan. The situation was slightly better in the afternoon, because the oil market reported increases, and people's hearts were firm. Huaniaopai rose back to 29.45 yuan, and Jinlong brand was at 28.5 yuan. However, there were not many transactions, and the market is still brewing.

Wheat has been stagnant for a long time. Although new wheat from the mainland has entered the market, its arrival in Shanghai is still pending. As for the wheat procurement by Chinese factories, Fufeng has stopped, and Fuxin still has pre-ordered overseas wheat that has not arrived, so the development of wheat sales in the future may not be realized in the short term.

### Oilcake, Soybean Cake Replenish Short Positions, Triggering a Surge

Actual sales of soybean cake are still sluggish. Morning futures were weak as usual, and prices fell by one or two cents compared to the previous day's market. In the afternoon, because some shorts covered their profits, the prices slowly rose. At the most firm time, the prices rose by three or four cents compared to the opening market in the morning. As a result, the closing market price was slightly lower by some cents, but still about two cents higher than the previous day's market. The transaction volume was 33-34,000 pieces of various cakes. Development characters were transacted at the March warehouse price of 16.6 yuan, Shenji's April warehouse price was 17.6 yuan, Shenji's May upper warehouse price for June upper delivery was 17.4 to 17.55 yuan, May lower warehouse price for June upper delivery was 18.55 to 75 cents, returning to 17.65 yuan, May lower warehouse price for June lower delivery was 18.75 cents, June upper warehouse price for June lower delivery was 19.1 to 19.5 yuan, then returning to 19.4 yuan.

On the 7th, 260 bags of exported soybeans and 420 bags of sesame were shipped to Hong Kong.

### 400 Tons of Diesel Arrive

Yesterday, 400 tons of diesel arrived in Shanghai. Since oil prices have been frequently expensive, public buses, power companies, and various factories have mostly switched to using diesel. Therefore, the need for diesel has suddenly increased. This import is a small supplement to industry and commerce.

### Sugar Market, 5,000 Tons of Dutch Sugar Arrive

The Chava Mailboat Company's Zhini Kana mail ship arrived yesterday afternoon, transporting 5,000 tons of granulated sugar, totaling 50,000 bags, from Java, and berthed at the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. It is said that some of it will be transferred to North China. (Zu)

### Metals, Double-Linked Plates Eagerly Sought

The 180-pound and 200-pound double-linked American tinplates circulating on the market have been extraordinarily beautiful in recent days. The street's egg factory gangs, kerosene can factories, printing factories, can factories, etc. have been enthusiastically seeking them every day. The market goods are also felt to be in short supply. The Tianjin gang is especially taking in a lot of 180-pound goods. Spot goods are becoming increasingly scarce, and the standard market conditions are rising rapidly. Yesterday, 180-pound was priced at 460 yuan per box, and 200-pound was priced at 480 yuan per box, each rising by more than 20 yuan compared to before. Currently, with overseas sources cut off, the stock in the Shanghai market is increasingly scarce, and it is inevitable that the market will rise again in the coming days.

### Coal, Mentougou Coal Opens — 360 Yuan Per Ton —

Since a large batch of new Mentougou white coal has been loaded, it has been successively put into storage. It was originally managed by a certain firm, but has now been resold to Yitaixing as an agent. The trade has been opened by fellow traders. Lump coal is priced at 360 yuan per ton, 70 yuan cheaper than Hongji. However, the coal quality is hard, and it is slightly explosive when burned. As this is the off-season for white coal sales, there are few customers and transactions are weak.

### Cocoa and Chocolate (Continued)

— Gao Jianchen

The cocoa tree is also a specialty of the New World, needless to say. Where did it originate? The great botanical geographer De Candolle said: "The cocoa tree naturally grows in the forests of the Amazon River basin, the Orinoco River basin, and their tributaries, up to an altitude of 400 meters." Indeed, that is probably where they originated. However, people can also see its traces in Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and neighboring areas. This was probably spread by the Indians a long time ago, before Columbus. In any case, De Candolle also said: "When the New World was discovered, this plant was cultivated in Central America and the Jiatou area. Its seeds were transported far to the Mexican plateau, and people valued them so much that they used them as currency." (To be continued)

### Malayan Federation as a British Fortress: Adopting Wartime Economic Policies, Preserving All to Exchange for Foreign Exchange and Raw Materials, Strictly Controlling Currency to Prevent Evasion, Rotary Club Member Li Yingsheng Speaks on Impressions of Malaya

The Rotary Club held its weekly luncheon at the Du Cheng Hotel, where member Li Yingsheng gave a speech on the situation in Malaya. According to him, Malaya is not only a military fortress for the Central Empire in the current war but also a "mint." The massive amounts of tin and rubber produced in Malaya and exported to the United States are enough to balance the trade of the four countries, helping Britain to purchase aircraft and other war materials from the United States.

Malayan Authorities' Recent Measures

Li mentioned his impressions of Malaya, stating that the Malayan government's wartime policy is to preserve all raw materials that can be exchanged for foreign exchange and to strictly control local currency to prevent capital flight. There are strict restrictions on remittances to other areas, which has inevitably affected the local overseas Chinese. A large number of people in Fujian and Guangdong provinces rely on remittances from Malaya for their livelihoods. Now, each family is only allowed to remit 250 Malayan dollars (approximately 2,000 Chinese legal tender) every two months. The total amount of these remittances is between 4 million and 8 million Malayan dollars per month.

Overseas Chinese Patriotic, Actively Donating

Since the implementation of the restrictions, the patriotic funds that overseas Chinese in Malaya remit back to their homeland have also been affected. Overseas Chinese in Malaya have always been enthusiastic about donating to their homeland. Now, at least only 500,000 Malayan dollars can be remitted out each month, which is far from the amount that overseas Chinese donate each month. Therefore, the accumulated patriotic funds that cannot be remitted out amount to millions of Malayan dollars.

Food and Supplies Abundant

The overseas Chinese in Malaya account for about 70% of the total population and occupy an important position in the business community, including capitalists, miners, farmers, and traders. Every important town has a chamber of commerce. Since the change in the international situation, Malaya will obtain food and manufactured goods, which it previously imported from countries outside the British Empire or the sterling area, from Australia, New Zealand, and India in the future.

Market Prosperity Reaches Its Peak

Li also stated that anyone who travels to Singapore is often entertained by local friends at the New World, Great World, and Happy World amusement parks. This is the central gathering place for urban crowds every night. They praised Chinese dramas and song and dance performances, movies, and various other venues (including restaurants and dance halls). The dance hall in the New World, apart from the Santa Ana dance hall in Manila, can be said to be the greatest in the Far East. It is equipped with air conditioning and has more than 170 dancers who constantly accompany the dancing. Street food stalls are almost everywhere in Singapore. It is not surprising to see commoners, wealthy businessmen, ladies from respectable families, and dancers sitting together to eat.

Medical Treatment Adopts New Equipment

Li further stated that Singapore's taxi drivers and rickshaw pullers are very polite. Singapore has a special court that specializes in local traffic matters. On average, about 60 people are punished every day for violating traffic regulations. Passengers can also file a complaint with the court if taxi drivers and rickshaw pullers behave rudely. Li also cited Malaya's leper hospital, saying that it uses the latest methods to treat leprosy, and about 150 people are cured and discharged from the hospital every year.

### The Tumultuous Struggle for the Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Rights

Datong News Agency reported that since the Japanese company Toa Kaiun Kaisha dispatched the Naruto Maru to operate the Shanghai-Ningbo route unsuccessfully, Chinese parties have been actively involved. The Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the following:

Naruto Maru Has Not Obtained Navigation Rights

The Shanghai-Ningbo route has been suspended since July of last year, after the Japanese expanded the blockade of the coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang. Since the fall of Ningbo, Chinese and Japanese merchants have been actively working to resume navigation for profit. At the end of last month, there was a rumor that the shipping rights had been seized by the Japanese company Toa Kaiun Kaisha, and the company dispatched the Naruto Maru to Ningbo for a time. In fact, the Naruto Maru was carrying Yuan Mou back to Ningbo and had a small amount of rice loaded on board, so it was able to sail, but it did not obtain the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping rights.

Chinese Join the Fray, Contending for the Rights

According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the current contenders for the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping rights include Chinese Lin Yaoqin and Zhang Yebai, each of whom has leased an old and dilapidated small steamer (which can carry about 500-600 tons). They are currently under repair and plan to operate under the name of Ningbo Shipping Company after the repairs are completed. In addition, Chinese Wu Linsheng and others are also planning to organize a shipping company to operate the Shanghai-Ningbo route. There are also Chinese Tang Ruyao and others who intend to lease sailboats for operation.

Japanese Liaison Ships Frequent

As for the Japanese side, they have not given up their attempt to operate the route. Therefore, although there are many contenders, the Japanese are currently using the excuse that the Zhejiang Sea blockade has not been lifted and that there is currently a plague in Ningbo. At the same time, Japanese transport ships and liaison ships are constantly sailing. Therefore, the Chinese merchants' attempt to compete for navigation rights will be difficult to succeed.

### Release of Detained Foreign Vessels: Rumors of Exchange Conditions

The foreign vessels detained in Shanghai, such as the Changde, have not been released because the Japanese have not allowed them to unload their cargo. According to shipping sources, the companies are still in the process of negotiating the matter. There is a rumor that the Japanese have already allowed the unloading of cargo, but there must be exchange conditions. As for what the measures are, it is impossible to know.

### President of the United China Relief Association Calls for Reconstruction of Chongqing

Praises the Perfection of Air Defense in the Joint University Entrance Examination; $5 Million Donation Progressing Smoothly

New York News: Mr. Brownell, President of the United China Relief Association of America, in view of the heavy losses caused by the bombing of Chongqing by a large number of Japanese aircraft, has appealed to the United States to provide relief and reconstruction to Chongqing. According to Brownell, Chongqing is repeatedly bombed by large groups of Japanese aircraft every year after the fog clears in mid-spring. On May 3rd of the year before last, the city was attacked by Japanese planes for the first time, and tens of thousands of residents were killed or injured. On May 3rd of last year, the number of deaths and injuries caused by the bombing had been reduced to about 500. On May 3rd of this year, Japanese aircraft committed crimes again in the capital, but although hundreds of tons of bombs were dropped in a few minutes, only five people were killed or injured. The reduction in the mortality rate is precisely a sign of the thoroughness of the Chinese authorities' defense. The population of Chongqing is now increasing rapidly, and its prosperity has doubled. Therefore, the President of the Association has specifically commended this fact in the progress of the $5 million fundraising campaign, so that Americans will admire the spirit of the Chinese and provide assistance.

### Groups Purchasing Hong Kong Rice Must Fill Out Application Forms; Saigon Broken Rice Pre-Determined Price Remains Unchanged

Recently, there were rumors that groups and factories could directly order cheap Xiaojiao rice from Xiangmao Foreign Company, which caused misunderstanding in all circles. People were sent to negotiate, but Xiangmao politely refused, instructing them to contact nearby rice shops to purchase. Therefore, the number of large-scale sales by retail rice shops in Shanghai has increased dramatically in recent days. According to the reporter of Pingming News Agency, the authorities in charge realized this the other day and were deeply afraid that unscrupulous people would take the opportunity to impersonate groups and purchase in large quantities, thereby reselling for profit. It was specifically stipulated that an application form for the Municipal Council's foreign rice must be obtained. In the future, all groups and companies that purchase in large quantities must contact nearby retail rice shops, and then the rice shop will report to Liji Foreign Company to obtain the application form, which will be filled out and stamped by the purchasing group. After Liji Foreign Company reviews and approves it, the transaction can be completed.

Groups Purchasing Rice Fill Out Items

This kind of application form has now been made. Retail rice shops can obtain it from Chanji Foreign Company when they encounter large-scale sales. The contents of the application form include: (1) Name of applicant, (2) Address, (3) Number of Chinese employees required by the Municipal Council (4) Average monthly consumption in 1940 (calculated as 224 pounds per bag) (5) Amount of rice obtained from the purchasing merchant by the applicant in 1940, or the amount of rice the applicant hopes to obtain in the future (6) Number of bags currently needed per month (calculated as 224 pounds per bag) (7) All of the above are true and reliable. I hereby guarantee that all foreign rice obtained from the Municipal Council will be directly managed and distributed by the applicant to the applicant's employees and will not be provided to other organizations. The representative of the Municipal Council can check the applicant's relevant records at any time (8) Applicant's seal.

More Than Sixty Rice Shops Order Rice

The second batch of cheap Xiaojiao rice has been distributed by Ruichangfa and other grain shops. In recent days, retail rice shops in Shanghai have sold out the cheap rice they purchased before, and they have recently purchased more from more than a dozen grain shops. However, some retail rice shops do not purchase from grain shops but directly order from Liji Foreign Company. There are also many. It is estimated that in the past two days, more than sixty retail rice shops have directly purchased from Liji Foreign Company, totaling more than 3,000 bags. Liji Foreign Company has designated the 3,000 bags of cheap Xiaojiao rice that arrived on the Yuezhou Ship the other day and instructed them to pay and pick up the goods at Xiangmao Foreign Company to meet the market demand.

Xinchangsheng Firm Dumps 1,000 Tons

The rice market, which had been sluggish for two days, seemed to be slightly more active yesterday, but the rice price did not show any signs of rising, and it was still similar to the previous two days. It was found that the number of transactions yesterday was more than the previous two days, but they were all dumped at reduced prices. Xinchangsheng Grain Firm at No. 17 Fuzhou Road sold 1,000 tons of Rangoon Xiaojiao rice for this month's futures, at a price of 133 yuan per bag, which was 50 cents less than the wholesale price of the Municipal Council's cheap Xiaojiao rice.

Saigon Broken Rice Pre-Determined Price

Yesterday, it was rumored that the French Municipal Council's controlled cheap Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 mixed broken rice, which was handled by various foreign companies, was already on its way to Shanghai, and the future public sale price would be 96 yuan and 20 cents per stone. The reporter specifically inquired from Dafoo Foreign Company. According to a senior official, the Saigon broken rice has not yet been shipped to Shanghai. As for the public sale price, there is no change. The weight of each bag is set at 220.46 pounds. The price of wholesale to various grain shops is 98 yuan per bag. The price of each grain shop to sell to rice shops shall not exceed 105 yuan and 84 cents per bag. The retail price of each rice shop is also about 87 yuan per bag, and there is no saying that it is more than 96 yuan per stone. Even the market price yesterday, the price of Saigon broken rice was only about 88-89 yuan per stone.

### Premier's Guangzhou Assassination 19th Anniversary: Commemorate with Silence, Emulate Premier's Efforts in Our Respective Positions

This month's 16th is the 19th anniversary of Premier's assassination in Guangzhou. All circles in Shanghai will commemorate with silence and emulate the Premier's revolutionary spirit, work hard in their respective positions, and continue to promote the austerity and savings and disaster relief movements to fulfill their national responsibilities.

### Women and Children from Ningbo Come to Shanghai to Escape Famine; Thousands of Passengers Crowded on Ships Daily

According to visitors from Ningbo, since the fall of Ningbo, due to the disruption of transportation, various necessities have been lacking supply. Although the population is small, prices are unusually expensive. As for food, it is even more difficult to purchase due to the long-term lack of supply and the thin bottom. This has formed the most serious problem at present. People in the countryside have come to Shanghai to escape famine for these reasons. In recent days, thousands of women and children have come to Shanghai via Dinghai every day. The Shanghai-Dinghai shipping ships are extremely crowded.

### Chasing Thieves on Avenue Joffre: Stray Bullet Shatters Shop Window

At about 3:00 p.m. yesterday, two bandits broke into the residence of a Yang surnamed person from Ningbo at No. 16 Pushi Village, Pushi Road, French Concession. One thief took out a gun to threaten them not to make a sound, rummaged through boxes and cabinets, and looted at will, causing a lot of property loss. The thieves carried the stolen goods and rushed out of the door, fleeing. The victim shouted wildly to catch the thieves. A Chinese constable from nearby No. 172 heard the sound and rushed to chase after them. The bandits opened fire to resist arrest, and the Chinese constable also drew his gun and fired back. For a time, gunshots rang out and bullets flew around. The chase went to the vicinity of Avenue Albert and Avenue Joffre, and finally one thief was captured alive, named Wang Songfa, 27 years old, from Shaoxing. A pistol and five bullets were found on his person. The other thief escaped without a trace. Fortunately, no one was injured when the Chinese constable fought with the bandits. Only a stray bullet shattered a large glass pane in the shop window of Wanxing Foreign Wine and Food Store at the intersection of Avenue Albert and Avenue Joffre. Afterwards, detectives conducted a thorough search of pedestrians in the Avenue Albert area and detained a thief. Together with the pistol and bullets, they were taken to the police station for handling. A special photography reporter from this newspaper happened to be passing by the area, immediately took out his camera and photographed the scene of the shop window being shattered, which is specially printed on the left. The lines in the picture are the cracks.

### Re-Examination of Public Bonds Set to Begin; Shanghai Payments to be Remitted

The National Debt Fund Management Committee, under orders, will handle the eleventh examination for capital repayment of the Re-Examination Public Bonds of the Republic of China, set to begin at 10:00 a.m. on July 10th. All groups have been notified to send representatives to supervise. The Re-Examination Public Bonds were issued in February of the 25th year of the Republic, totaling 40,400,000 national currency. The principal and interest due this time are 2,720,000 yuan for principal repayment and 9,690,000 yuan for matured interest, totaling 12,410,000 yuan for principal and interest. All winning bonds will be paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications, starting from August 11th, in six installments in Shanghai. All payment and discounting methods are the same as those for the Unified Public Bonds. The funds for the principal and interest to be paid were originally allocated from customs revenue. Since customs revenue in the occupied areas was intercepted, the Ministry of Finance announced a change in the repayment method. Therefore, the payment of principal and interest on these public bonds was temporarily suspended. Now, in order to maintain the value of the bonds, the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank will provide discount loans. All bondholders have expressed their admiration for the government's measures.

### Shanghai Hospital's Tuberculosis Prevention Equipment Carried Away Yesterday Morning: Included an X-Ray Machine Worth 200,000 Yuan

At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the Shanghai Hospital at No. 172 Qiqi Road in the French Concession was suddenly stripped of its tuberculosis treatment equipment worth 200,000 yuan. It is heard that this equipment was entrusted to the Shanghai Tuberculosis Prevention Association by the Chinese National Government for safekeeping. Today, it was moved from upstairs to downstairs by association and police personnel, ignoring the protests of the association's foreign staff, and loaded onto a truck hired by Maotai Foreign Company and driven away. It is heard that it included an X-ray machine, a surgical table, and many other valuable instruments. At that time, the hospital's American director, Mr. Haajingge, stated to them that the hospital had not received any notice in advance, so please postpone it for a few days to facilitate negotiations. However, the people who came did not agree, and before leaving, they also said that there were still 60 beds in the hospital, which also belonged to the Shanghai Municipal Government, and they would soon come to take them away. Mr. Haajingge immediately said to them, "If that is the case, then the patients in the hospital will have to sleep on the floor?" His words were very indignant.

### Japanese Side to Try Post Office Robbery Case Under Military Law: Principal Offender Japanese National Once Worked for the Army; Details of the Case Still Under Investigation

According to reliable sources, regarding the 2.5 million yuan robbery case at the Post Office General Bureau last Saturday, although the Japanese authorities have arrested one Japanese and one Chinese offender, they are still investigating the case in detail. Once the investigation is complete, the Japanese side will open a military court to interrogate the Japanese offender, Yoshio Nomura. It is found that the offender is 37 years old and previously worked in a certain department of the Japanese Army. He was recently dismissed from his post.

Liang Convicted Four Times, Sentenced to Death

According to reliable sources, the Chinese principal offender in this case, Liang Zhengguang, real name Liang Senyi (transliteration), is 40 years old and has a long history of crimes. He is the leader of a large kidnapping gang. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he was sentenced to death four times and once sentenced to long-term imprisonment. All were appealed and pardoned. His bandit heart was difficult to change, and he colluded with the Japanese to rob the post office. It is believed that after the Japanese side completes its investigation of this case, the Public Security Bureau of the International Settlement will accuse Liang of the post office robbery case and the number of old cases that he instigated or participated in. All crimes will be investigated and severely punished.

### Rong Wu Society to Hold Sutra Lecture Tomorrow

The Rong Wu Sutra Lecture Society will hold a sutra lecture on the 8th, still at 3:00 p.m. old time and 4:00 p.m. new time, at the Bule Hall on the fourth floor of the Chinese Vocational Education Society on Huanlong Road. Listeners can go on time.

### Japanese Restrictions on British Entry: British Do Not Take Seriously: British-Japanese Tensions Have Entered a New Stage

Reliable sources say that from today onwards, all British nationals applying for visas to Japan must obtain the approval of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs before they can apply to the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai for a certificate. A Pingming News Agency reporter recently learned from the British Consulate General in Shanghai that they have not yet obtained official information, but they say that this method does not seem to have any meaning. Not long ago, the Japanese side restricted all British and American journalists from going to Japan, requiring them to first obtain the approval of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo. This decision only applies to British nationals, which shows that the tension between Britain and Japan has entered a new stage. The reporter asked personnel from the American Consulate about this matter, but they declined to comment. According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, quoting news from the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai, this method is purely a temporary measure. In the future, all those who request to obtain a passport to Japan or have already requested it and have not yet obtained a passport must be approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo on a case-by-case basis.

### Rickshaw Merchants Write to the Municipal Council Requesting an Increase in Rickshaw Rent

The rickshaw merchants in the Public Concession have been suffering heavy losses because the price of rubber, hardware, and vehicle materials has soared, and the current rickshaw rent revenue is not enough to maintain expenses. However, the rickshaw rent is restricted by the Municipal Council and cannot be increased on its own. They have repeatedly submitted requests to the Public Utilities Committee and the Board of Directors for reconsideration and a discretionary increase in rent to help maintain expenses. However, after a long time, the authorities have not approved it. Based on the suggestions and requests of its members, the industry association sent another letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, listing the ratio of commodity prices and rickshaw rent to expenses, and pointing out the price increases in various industries and the industry's encounters. For example, the authorities have given special consideration to public utilities such as automobiles, trams, buses, electricity, and tap water, and have repeatedly allowed price increases, but the industry's request has not been approved, making it impossible for the industry to maintain its operations and leading to bankruptcy. Therefore, it should be approved quickly.

### Colonel Howard Fetes North China US Military Officers: Lieutenant Colonel Ashworth and Ten Others Pass Through Shanghai by Ship and Will Soon Go to Beijing to Take Office

US Newly appointed commander of North China troops Lt. Col. Ashworth, together with nine subordinate officers, arrived in Shanghai this Wednesday via the President Coolidge ship. They are currently residing in the 13-story building in the French Concession, and are being entertained separately by Colonel Howard, and Major Boone of the 4th Marine Regiment of the US stationed in Shanghai. Colonel Howard and Lt. Col. Ashworth originally served in the US Navy Department in San Diego. The fact that the two were ordered to come to China one after another and are living in different places is a great joy. Colonel Howard hosted a welcome dinner for Lt. Col. Ashworth at the US Navy Club at 7:00 p.m. last night, raising glasses to reminisce about the past. The newly appointed commander of North China troops Lt. Col. Ashworth worked in the US 4th Marine Regiment here from 1930 to 1933 and has many friends in Shanghai. He also knows the situation in the Far East well. He will stay in Shanghai for a while before taking a car to Beijing to take office. Those who will go to Beijing with him to take office include Major Quinsin, Major Letcher, Major Blanc, and Captain John Craig, Mark Craig, Ramsay, Wagner, Lieutenant Pickett, and Lieutenant Shauffner, a group of nine people. The US Navy Department's transfer of the commander of the garrison in China is enough to show the strengthening of defenses in the Far East.

### Vegetable Prices Plummet

In recent days, vegetables from various places have been pouring in, which seems to be an oversupply. Also, because the weather is hot, it is not easy to store them for a long time, so market prices are gradually falling. Water chestnuts have fallen from 17-18 yuan per load to 4 yuan, cabbage from 16 yuan to 5 yuan, and mustard greens from 12 yuan to 6 yuan. However, the prices of meat and fish dishes have risen because the yellow croaker and black carp seasons have passed. Other fish, meat, and shrimp are becoming scarce and expensive. Therefore, vegetable vendors are feeling that business is difficult and it is difficult to maintain operations.

### Foreman of Ruirong Iron Factory Cut Down: Six or Seven Axe Wounds to the Head, Seriously Injured

Li Ruigen, a local, 36 years old, is currently a foreman at the British Ruirong Iron Factory in Yangshupu, Shanghai. His home is at a certain number on Yangzhou Road, Pengpeng Road. At 7:05 a.m. yesterday, Li had breakfast as usual and left home to go to the factory to work. Unexpectedly, just as he stepped out of the doorway, a man suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, holding a sharp axe, and lunged forward, wielding the axe to chop at Li fiercely. Li was unable to dodge in time and was chopped six or seven times. One axe struck the top of his head, injuring his brain, which was the most dangerous. He fell to the ground in a pool of blood. The attacker, seeing that he had achieved his goal, quickly fled with the axe without a trace. Afterwards, the police constable who heard the alarm rushed to the scene and immediately called an ambulance to send Li to the Hudong Hospital for treatment. It is heard that his injuries are serious and his life is in danger. It is also heard that the case is a vendetta. The police are secretly arresting the murderer.

### Oil Firm Manager Embezzled and Arrested

The Wanchanghe Oil Firm at No. 98 Henan Road was established by Tang Chengzhang, and Zhou Anbang from Ningbo served as the manager. All personnel and economic matters were handled by Zhou, and Tang did not consult at all. Recently, Tang suddenly discovered that Zhou had embezzled public funds. After checking the accounts, he learned that Zhou had embezzled about 30,000 national currency over the past few years. He reported it to the Central Police Station. Western Detective Jones and Chinese detectives arrested Zhou. He was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, said that the accounts had not been completely verified, so the actual amount of embezzlement could not be determined yet and should be rescheduled for interrogation. Zhou Anbang said that when the Wanchanghe Firm was established, it only had a capital of 10,000 yuan. Through his efforts, the profits over the years had reached 500,000 yuan. If he slightly used public funds, why would he sue to the court? Judge Feng verified the report and ordered Zhou Anbang to be temporarily detained and rescheduled for interrogation after the accounts had been checked.

### Post Office Recruit Letter Carriers: Written Exam Tomorrow at Aurora University Auditorium on Route Tenant de Viliers

The Post Office Administration's physical examination for letter carrier recruitment, which began earlier this month, concluded on the 6th of last month. Only about 1,300 candidates passed the screening. The Bureau originally scheduled the written examination for the 25th of last month at the Bureau of Bridges and Roads on Sichuan Road. However, due to the large number of candidates, the examination rooms were insufficient to accommodate them. Therefore, the exam has been rescheduled to tomorrow, the 8th, at the Aurora University Auditorium on Route Tenant de Viliers in the French Concession.

### Maternal Uncle Plots Against Nephew, Extorting with Threatening Letters Beforehand: Two Letters Demanding 50,000 Yuan, Finally Sending a Hand Grenade

Jin Baoheng, a Ningbo native and employee of the Taitai foreign firm on Sichuan Road, lives at No. 54 Sanyuan Lane, Xinkai Road. His ten-year-old son, Qingchen, and seven-year-old son, Wuchen, both attend a school in the French Concession. Every day, their grandfather, Yu Erkang, accompanies them to school. At around 8 a.m. on the 27th of last month, Yu Erkang, as usual, led his two grandsons out to school. While waiting for the tram at the intersection of Xin Zha Road and Seymour Road,

Suddenly Encountered Kidnappers

Several people forcibly dragged and kidnapped Jin Wuchen. Subsequently, his brother, Qingchen, shouted loudly. Passersby and Western detective Keipu heard the noise and helped to pursue and capture one of the kidnappers, Yu Xuekui, from Jiading. Following this, in Room 15 of the Shanghai New Hotel on Guangdong Road, they continued to capture a local man, Pu Jinlin, and rescued the kidnapped victim. They were all taken to the police station. After questioning, it was learned that the case was initiated by the kidnapped victim's mother's brother, Yuan Jinrong. Thereupon, they

Arrested Yuan

And sent him to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the case was continued in the Second Criminal Court by the judge. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them in court. According to the police lawyer Li Zhishan, during the adjournment, it was found that Yuan Jinrong had sent a threatening letter to Jin Erkang on April 18, attempting to extort 50,000 yuan. Currently, all the threatening letters have been sent for inspection to

Verify Handwriting

Therefore, he requested another adjournment. Following this, Jin Erkang claimed that he had received threatening letters one after another. The first letter demanded 　 yuan, and the second increased to 50,000 yuan. If he did not comply, his life would be in danger. He considered such threatening letters worthless and ignored them. Unexpectedly, the third time someone sent a cloth bag. Fearing that it contained dangerous items, he rushed it to the Gordon Road police station. Upon opening it, it turned out to be

A Grenade

However, who wrote the letters was unknown. Yuan Jinrong was a relative, often visiting my house as a child, etc. After the judge questioned Yu Xuekui and Yuan Jinrong, he ordered them to be detained for another seven days for verification.

### Education News: Guangxi Provincial Government Meeting Passes Student Meal Regulations, Providing Assistance to Publicly Funded Students in Secondary Schools and Above

(Guilin Dispatch) In response to the recent surge in rice prices in various regions, the Guangxi Provincial Government recognized that most publicly funded students in provincial secondary schools and above are impoverished. If the original public funding standards were maintained, it would be difficult for these students to afford meals. Therefore, at the 535th meeting of the Provincial Committee, the "Guangxi Provincial Publicly Funded Student Meal Subsidy Measures" were passed to provide relief. The main points of the measures are as follows: (1) Based on the budget for the 30th year of the Republic, a monthly allowance of 15 National Currency (yuan) will be provided. If the price of rice reaches 30.1 to 40 yuan per 100 catties, each student will receive an additional 5 yuan per month. If it reaches 40.1 to 50 yuan, each student will receive an additional 9 yuan per month, and so on. (2) If the price of rice exceeds 50.1 yuan per 100 catties, the calculation will follow the first clause. The increased meal expenses, except for students in provincial midwifery, nursing, and normal schools, will still be provided by the provincial government. Students in other schools (departments/classes) will be responsible for their own arrangements, but impoverished students may apply to the provincial government for a meal loan equal to the increased amount. This loan should be repaid in equal installments over three years, starting one year after graduation. (3) Each month, the increased meal expenses and meal loans will be based on the previous month's rice prices. Schools will prepare budgets and student rosters separately and submit them to the provincial and county governments for advance disbursement. (4) If students in county normal training classes need assistance with meal expenses, the county may, at its discretion based on its financial resources, provide meal subsidies or loans in accordance with these measures.

### Central Technical College to Recruit New Students in July

(Chongqing Dispatch) The National Central Technical College has five departments: Agricultural Manufacturing, Leather Manufacturing, Papermaking, Dyeing and Weaving, and Sericulture. It is well-equipped and has seven practice factories. The teachers are all experienced experts in both theory and practice. Emphasis is placed on training in advanced theory and practical skills. 164 students have already graduated from the five departments. Before graduation, they are recruited by various public and private factories to serve as engineers, factory directors, managers, technicians, etc., which shows the urgent need for such specialized talents in various fields in our country. Many graduates also raise funds to operate their own factories. It is reported that the school is scheduled to recruit 30 first-year students each in Yueyang, Leshan (where the school is located), Chongqing, Chengdu, Nanchong, Luzhou, and Guiyang in late July. High school graduates are eligible to apply. The course lasts three years. At the same time, the Agriculture, Forestry, Papermaking, and Dyeing and Weaving departments are recruiting 15 first-year, second-semester transfer students. Those who have studied for one semester in a specialized school or university are eligible to apply. Once the examination dates are confirmed, the enrollment prospectus will be announced.

### Dispute Over Distribution of Relief Funds at Guoben Primary School, Entering Administrative Handling Stage

(Guanghua News Agency) The privately run Guoben Primary School on Jiaozhou Road, Yuyuan Road, received a total of 840 yuan in relief funds for teachers and staff. Because eight new teachers did not receive a share, they believed that the school authorities deliberately embezzled the funds. They reported it to the police the other day, and the director, Jin Shiquan, was arrested and questioned. Later, the school hired lawyer Fan Gang to bail him out, and the police ordered an out-of-court settlement. The education authorities are also sending staff to investigate. According to the Guanghua News Agency reporter, the case will soon enter the administrative handling stage and should be resolved fairly and reasonably.

### Guoqiang Middle School Arithmetic Competition

The privately run Guoqiang Middle School is known for its strict teaching and management. Therefore, less than a year after its establishment, it has been approved by the Ministry of Education for registration. The school attaches great importance to basic subjects, so the level of Chinese, English, and arithmetic is higher than that of ordinary middle schools, which has earned the trust of students' parents. Recently, in order to cultivate students' habits of using both hands and brains, the school held an arithmetic competition the other day, with the basic four arithmetic operations as the scope of rapid calculation. The time limit was only eight minutes. All the students were able to concentrate their thoughts and will in the shortest possible time and accelerate their efforts. As a result, the results were exceptionally good. Gu Zhaoqi, a student in the Junior 2A class, accurately answered 123 questions in a very short time, which is truly commendable. All the teachers and students of the school praised him as an "active computer."

### Letter to the Editor

We received a letter from Aiguo No. 2 Primary School yesterday, which reads: Sir, the education news in your newspaper on June 5 (editor's note: the draft was issued by Dahua News Agency) stating that our school's "entire faculty raised demands..." and "teachers and staff were satisfied" are not in accordance with the facts. After investigation, only a portion of the teachers in our school raised demands, not the entire faculty, and there were no staff members involved. We hereby inform you of this. Sincerely, Private Aiguo No. 2 Primary School, June 6, 30th year of the Republic.

### Study Lecture: How to Study Zoology (5)

— Yuan Shanzheng

B. Breeding Research

Everyone knows that studying animals, dead materials are not as good as living things. For experiments and observing life functions and life states, non-living materials are indispensable. As for investigating their habits, development, life phenomena, and reproductive processes, one must breed them oneself. Tadpoles in small bottles, goldfish in large tanks, birds in cages, dogs in kennels, crickets in boxes, and crickets in basins, such as silkworms, are all readily available materials for breeding research.

C. Anatomical Research

To dissect animals and study physiological structure, organs, and tissues, it is of course good to have a complete laboratory with complete equipment. Otherwise, the kitchen at home is a simple laboratory. Slaughtering chickens and ducks, killing fish and shrimp, are all opportunities for experiments. Slaughterhouses and pig slaughterhouses are larger in scale. If one can study carefully, one can gain a lot.

D. Record Research

The most important thing in the study of zoology is reality. Regarding the external morphology, living conditions, developmental process, and physiological structure of animals, without detailed records, one cannot fully remember, and there is no basis for future comparison and review. Therefore, recording is an indispensable part of animal research. The content of the record must be concise, clear, accurate, and precise. The form should be tabular, and diagrams should be used to supplement the deficiencies of the text when necessary. (End)

### Creative Imagination

— Wu Dai

The other day, the Christian East China Six Universities held a joint graduation ceremony, and Bishop Lixuan De gave a speech on "Creative Imagination," which can be said to be very timely.

The graduates of this year's university, just as they were about to enter the gates of the university, coincided with the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, a time of turmoil. A person without creative imagination, seeing the campus fall, the school buildings destroyed, would probably have been pessimistic and depressed long ago, and would not have had the heart to run or attend school. Therefore, the fact that the students of each school were able to graduate smoothly this year can be said to be a manifestation and result of the creative imagination of the school authorities and the students themselves.

War

### War, Pestilence, Famine

— Xinliang

When a country is at war, the mortality rate immediately increases. It is of course not surprising that thousands or hundreds of people die under the latest weapons of modern warfare, but war also bestows upon mankind two threats—famine and pestilence. According to statistics by Professor Lehman of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, 1,221,900 innocent civilians died of disease during the last European war, which is almost as many as the 1,263,700 soldiers who sacrificed in the line of fire. During the American Civil War (1861-1865), a total of 186,000 soldiers died of disease; only 94,000 sacrificed in the line of fire. Someone said that Napoleon's defeat was clearly caused by hunger and disease. "Disease is more deadly than guns!" This sentence is indeed quite meaningful.

In 1918, Germany suffered from malnutrition among its people and soldiers due to a lack of food. At that time, a "contagious edema" was prevalent in continental Europe, the cause of which was a lack of protein. Rickets was very common in the Vienna area, and ordinary children suffered from this disease due to the inability to drink enough milk. Dr. Haileyes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States told us: "Don't just fill your stomach, we should pay attention to nutrition!" Will this war produce a famine like the last one? Of course, it cannot be predicted at present. Although we can now use various chemical raw materials to manufacture food, we also have to ask those arms dealers to show some compassion and not scavenge all the chemical raw materials to manufacture gunpowder! Moreover, people cannot live on vitamins or some inorganic substances alone.

In addition, we are also worried about the current occurrence of various infectious diseases such as pneumonia, dysentery, typhoid fever, and malaria. A few months ago, a yellow fever was discovered in the Niu Bian Mountains of British-Egyptian Sudan. If it has the possibility of spreading to Europe, it must be a disaster for mankind. Last fall, a terrible dysentery also spread in German-occupied France. During the last European war, pneumonia was once rampant, but this time I have not heard of a large number of people dying from pneumonia.

Now many people believe that a "germ warfare" will appear soon. The warring parties are preparing to put infectious disease bacteria in cans, and then use airplanes to drop them into the streets and pools in the enemy's rear to make them all sick and die, so as not to waste ammunition. Future paratroopers may also carry a large group of plague rats to land with them. In fact, the reason why this kind of "living bomb" has not yet been adopted is that once a plague occurs and spreads, it is difficult to eradicate, and it may even infect one's own army.

In the past, the Crusades, the French Revolution, the Crimean War...etc., were all times when pestilence was most rampant. If this war lasts for a long time, it will of course cause many people to die of pestilence even if they do not die under guns.

Education

### He's Back Again

— Binghong

De is an old school janitor who has served our school for five years. So, in our mouths, this name has become quite familiar.

De has a naturally clumsy mind, which can be seen from his coarse and detestable appearance and his dull and foolish behavior. He also has a unique stubborn personality, refusing to admit any mistakes, even if he has no reason to defend himself. He still refuses to restrain his flying spittle, rambling on incoherently in a loud voice. But he is very naive. Although he is over forty years old, he still often argues with elementary school students. I remember once he was pushed down by a first-grade student and burst into tears, lying on the ground, refusing to get up. Large, bean-sized tears kept pouring out. He thought he had suffered a great loss and had to express it to the teachers so they could take revenge for him. Knowing his usual temper, we couldn't help but burst into laughter. A strong man being pushed down by a child under ten years old, wouldn't that be a joke? Seeing that we didn't react, he embarrassedly got up and staggered to the kitchen, muttering incessantly.

Because of his muddleheadedness, the other janitors all bullied him, pushing all the heavy and troublesome tasks onto him alone. The students made fun of him, the teachers often gave him a dressing-down, and he was dismissed several times. Finally, because of his faithfulness and "cheapness"—low salary—he was invited back by the principal. Anyway, everyone treated him like a beast of burden, but I didn't like to order him around, not to show my own humanity, but because he was too prone to making mistakes.

As the cost of living climbed higher and higher, our "benevolent" principal, out of consideration for the hard-working janitors, gave each of them an extra "three silver dollars"; but what about our De? Of course, there was no such "favor" for him.

On the 30th, salaries were paid, and early in the morning of the 1st, De was seen standing blankly at the door of the office, as if waiting for something. His wrinkled face was sallow and lifeless, his brows were tightly furrowed, and the corners of his drooping mouth twitched from time to time. His usually fierce eyes had no sparkle at all. It was the first time I had seen him with such a sad and submissive expression, which couldn't help but arouse sympathy and pity.

Sure enough, he was waiting for someone. As soon as the administrative director ran in, he hurriedly followed him in.

"Mr. ×, did Dasheng get an extra three dollars in salary?" The uncontrollable anger gradually rose to his face.

"Who said that?" came the cold reply.

"Don't hide it from me. I know Ah Jin also got an extra three dollars. Why didn't I?"

"You? You didn't. It's the principal's decision. I don't know!"

"How can you not know? You, you are the accountant of this school! Why can't I get it? Am I not human? Look at my daily life. I do even more than Dasheng. I have to get up at three o'clock every day to boil water, sweep the floor, prepare the meals..."

Veins popped out on his face. He was panting, as if he wanted to devour the administrative director. Although he was stupid, he knew the need for "money" after all. Because I "had no say," I retreated to the side to quietly observe their development. The principal rushed over, using an even fiercer attitude to silence him. After all, the principal had the authority to subdue him.

"What! It's already enough that I haven't fired a fool like you. Ridiculous... Don't be talkative! Shut up or get out!"

"Get out! I'll get out. We won't go without food. At most, I'll go carry stones again..." he said, wiping his tears, and turned to leave.

After De left, we posted advertisements to recruit janitors, but none of them could handle the heavy workload. After trying for three days, they resigned on their own.

About two weeks later, De came back again. This was not unexpected. This time was originally his first return. Whenever he saw someone, he would say, "The principal asked me to come back!" saying it with great pride.

One day I asked him, "De, did your salary get increased?" He coldly shook his head, without any expression.

### Military and Mental Illness

— Wenhe

The United States is now carrying out conscription, and the qualifications for soldiers naturally require physical fitness. However, according to the experience of the last war, a soldier with a sound body may not have a sound mind. Many people suffer from shell shock. After hearing the sound of cannons, their legs become paralyzed, or they become mute or blind. There are also a small number of people who develop various kinds of mental illnesses. The United States government spent one billion gold yuan in fourteen years just to treat these mentally ill soldiers and veterans—this sum of money could be used to build no less than 50,000 military aircraft.

After learning this lesson, the U.S. military authorities certainly cannot repeat the same mistakes this time. Because a soldier with an unsound mind not only cannot fight, but also affects the morale of the entire team. The U.S. Army has now hired 600 psychiatrists in major cities to assist military doctors in dealing with mental health issues. Some soldiers who do not like to make friends, or who make a big deal out of some minor illnesses, are showing signs of mental disorder. Once these people encounter real combat, serious symptoms will appear. However, according to a survey, people with these symptoms account for one-tenth of the total number of soldiers who enlisted in 1940.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(9) An Eccentric Farmer: After drinking a few cups of wine, some quick-tongued people couldn't help but ask:

"Does Third Master Wu have some kind of poisonous sore on his face?"

"No," Old Master Wu told them the explanation he had prepared in advance. "After my niece-in-law died last month, Third Master Wu made offerings to her in the temple. Young people like to be quick about everything, and inevitably they are a little careless. Somehow, he knocked over a candlestick and was burned by the candle wax. Even his left eye was almost lost."

Everyone looked at Wu San's face. Sure enough, there was a very long black mark above and below his left eye, and even a piece of the lower eyelid was broken.

After this very simple introduction, Begonia officially settled down in Li Village. At first, not only did the white cloth wrapped around his face attract everyone's attention, but also the cleanliness of his clothes and shoes, and the whiteness of his complexion, caused many women in the village to discuss it for several months. Of course, Little Plum Blossom's appearance and clothes were also absolutely different from the other children in this village. Even the nanny, because she had been pampered for several years, always seemed too beautiful standing among the women in the neighboring families.

Although life in the countryside gradually calmed Begonia's heart, at the same time, this kind of environment was inevitably too lonely. (126)

### Hollywood Snippets Record

George Raft used to be together with Norma Shearer day and night, going in and out together. At that time, people generally believed that they would get married soon. But after George recently divorced, he declared that his future wife would definitely not be a movie employee, so the matter with Norma Shearer was no longer mentioned.

As the war in Europe continues to expand, the United States has passed a compulsory military training bill to prevent future troubles. Under the premise of national defense first, stars are no exception. All American youths from the age of twenty-one to thirty-five must register with the military training office. Currently, James Stewart, Cary Grant, and Lew Ayres are all on the list to be called up.

The great director Cecil B. DeMille recently said to young people in various places during his travels: "If you have the talent and ambition to act, if you have the courage to work hard, and if you can maintain your own life, then please come to Hollywood and try." These few words of his seem sincere and earnest, but you must know that this is an instruction, not an invitation!

Dorothy Lamour originally had a scene in her new film "The Road to Zanzibar" where she emerged from the water naked, sacrificing her beauty. But she firmly opposed this scene. After much discussion, Lamour finally agreed, but on one condition: that there should be no more sarongs in her new films thereafter.

Hollywood's only beauty authority, Miss Factor, has the most research on the beauty of female stars. Recently, she made a statement saying: A perfect beauty must have Betty Grable's figure, Alice Faye's lips, Hedy Lamarr's eyes, Lana Turner's nose, Greta Garbo's shoulders, Marlene Dietrich's legs, Loretta Young's height, and Linda Darnell's complexion. If a person can have these strengths, then her great success is undoubtedly assured.

The "patriotic actors" Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, after finishing "21 Days Together" and "That Hamilton Woman", abandoned their honor, status, property and security, and returned to bombing Britain together. Laurence will join the Royal Air Force, and Vivien Leigh will take on nursing duties. Such cooperation and courage between the couple are no wonder why the people of Hollywood are looking at them with admiration.

Chapter Ten: The First Public Sun Sword Qi

Xu Jing understood the bizarre story after hearing what the two said. Wang Yongtai sighed, "Zhong Geng's words are unspeakable; what is speakable is ugly! It's all the old man's mistake. Taking that lowly person as a concubine led to today's evil deeds, almost wrongly blaming a good person. Nephew is an ambitious young man, no wonder he must come to expose this secret for me and wash away the injustice. Good, you two are outstanding young talents, and the younger generation is to be feared. The old man is old! He has great expectations for you two. I am pleased that Nephew Xu can get to know this Mr. Liu, with discerning eyes. Mr. Liu is highly skilled and careful, and his swordsmanship is exquisite, which can be called the first in the Public Sun Sword Qi! Let me introduce him to General Zhou, and work together for the country." Liu Yin Ying bowed and thanked him, "Thank you, Hero Wang, for the undeserved praise. If I have the opportunity, I will definitely follow your lead. I hope Hero Wang will be a bulwark for the country and establish outstanding achievements." Wang Yongtai stroked his beard and smiled. "Old but strong, knowing the heart of the white-haired, although the old man does not dare to hope for General Lian Ma Fubo in the front, but if the bandit comes, the old man will also do my best to deal with him, so that the bandit does not laugh at Qin Wu." He said to Xu Jing, "Nephew, our misunderstanding can be completely eliminated in the future. After I deal with those two, I will set up a banquet to apologize to Nephew, and I still invite Nephew to stay at my house. And this Mr. Liu, I am also very willing to talk to him, and it is okay to live here together." Xu Jing repeatedly said that he dared not, and it was a blessing that Uncle did not blame his recklessness. At this time, the drums outside had already struck four times. Liu Yinying stood up and said, "Oh, it's getting late! I have to go back, and I will visit the old hero another day." Wang Yongtai wanted to keep him, but Liu Yinying said, "This is the first time I have come out of the thatched cottage. My aunt at home does not know, so I am anxious to rush back overnight, so as not to be blamed by her. Besides, if my aunt suddenly sees me missing tomorrow morning, if she doesn't know the details, wouldn't it tire her old man to worry? It's better to hurry home and hide it from her old man, which is safer." Xu Jing said, "Since Brother is going back to the mountain, I will go back with you. Otherwise, my aunt will also be suspicious. We will report to your aunt tomorrow and then come to serve you." Wang Yongtai did not want to keep them after hearing them say this. But he repeatedly invited Xu Jing to accompany Liu Yinying to get together. So Liu Yinying and Xu Jing said goodbye to Wang Yongtai and hurried back to the mountain. (83)

(11) Mao Shilai

The so-called Xiaomingdan in Beiping are Mao Shilai, Zhang Junqiu, Song Dezhu, and Li Shifang, and Mao Shilai is the chief. Mao is a disciple of the fifth class of the Fuliancheng Society and is the younger brother of Mao Qinglai. He entered the class at the age of eleven, learning to paint clothes, and then learning Huadan. Fuliancheng teachers Li Lianzhen and Xiao Changhua, etc., seeing his artistic potential, taught him carefully and helped him to succeed. At the beginning of his career, he was known as the best of the fifth class in Fuliancheng. Shilai has a beautiful face, a handsome appearance, and a petite and exquisite figure. His eyebrows are very similar to Shang Xiaoyun, and his work is close to Gou Huisheng. Combining the strengths of the two, he specializes in the Huadan line. The first time he came to Shanghai to belong to Huangjin, he was recognized by those who knew the music. The Huangjin authorities, in order to promote new talents, extended his stay in the south for the past two years, and his art and reputation have improved with each passing day. Furong Cao Yi loved his talent and recorded him as a disciple, teaching him Huadan opera. And the Gou Jianjiang E Lu Gongjun, Yuwei Ji Shang, specially introduced Lie Huisheng Douqiang. He is only twenty-one years old this year. Among the rising Dan roles in the former capital, Shilai can be said to have the most prestigious reputation. (Correction: In the previous issue, Gao Qingkui's tenth was mistakenly ranked seventh, please pay attention.) The souls of the soulful actors are burned with patriotic enthusiasm. Therefore, everyone began to embark on the journey with unified steps, shouldering the mission of cultural propaganda of drama and education.

In this way, Jinshan said goodbye to Shanghai.

For the past three and a half years, we have seen Jinshan's struggling photos, and we have heard Jinshan's struggling news, but we have not seen his face, which makes people miss him so much!

Jinshan and his partner Wangying have traveled all over the motherland, and recently arrived in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is not far from Shanghai, will they return to Shanghai?

That's right, there was a time when it was rumored that they had returned to Shanghai; but when we analyzed it with common sense and reason, how could they return to Shanghai?

There is gratifying news:

Jinshan and Wangying are preparing to make a movie at their own expense in Hong Kong. They are now actively planning the capital. The script has been written by Hu Chunbing, and the title is "Defend the Motherland." What an exciting script!

With the era as the background, reality as the subject matter, and coupled with Jinshan and Wangying's handsome appearance and three years of flesh-and-blood life, we are certain that the performance of "Defend the Motherland" will be excellent. It is a pity that we can only see Cantonese films produced in Hong Kong, but we cannot see this kind of film!
