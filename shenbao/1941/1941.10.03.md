### Great Victory of the Chinese Army's Counteroffensive in Northern Hunan; Japanese Army Retreats on Three Routes; Chinese Forces Intercept Between the Xinqiang and Miluo Rivers; Heavy Casualties Suffered by Japanese Troops in Dongyang, Yong'an, and Other Areas

Changsha – The main force of the Japanese army, numbering over 100,000, which was besieged by the Chinese army in areas such as Dongyang City, Yong'an City, and Huanghua City between the Liuyang River and the Laodao River, suffered heavy casualties after several days of fierce attacks by the Chinese army. Exhausted of ammunition and provisions, the entire front wavered, and they began to flee north in three routes around 2 AM on the 2nd. The Chinese army is currently pursuing them vigorously and has established a strong interception between the Xinqiang and Miluo Rivers. The spoils of war from this battle are numerous and are currently being tallied. (2nd Dispatch)

Chongqing – Although it is currently impossible to report the exact war results obtained by the Chinese army in the major battle in Northern Hunan, it is certain that this campaign has come to an end. The initial assessment here was that approximately 80,000 Japanese troops were fighting on the front lines. However, lacking both ammunition and provisions and unable to withstand the fierce attacks of the Chinese army, they retreated north this morning along their original advance routes, namely Chunhua Mountain, Fulinpu, and the railway line, in three routes. During the retreat, before crossing the Xinqiang River, they were ambushed everywhere by the Chinese army. (2nd Havas News Agency Dispatch)

Chongqing – Chinese military news: The Chinese army in Northern Hunan has achieved a great victory in its counteroffensive. The Japanese army on the south bank of the Miluo River is in full retreat, fleeing north along the entire line. Various units of the Chinese army are currently pursuing and annihilating the enemy within the encirclement, with the force of a wind sweeping away fallen leaves. Huanghua City, Yong'an City, and other places along the Changsha-Liuyang line have been recovered. Corpses are piled up like mountains in the Laodao River area. Strongholds from Jinjing to Chunhua Mountain have also been recovered. The military authorities here believe that although the Japanese army is currently desperately trying to break through and retreat towards Yueyang, most of the strongholds on both banks of the Xinqiang and Miluo Rivers are controlled by the Chinese field army. Whether the Japanese troops retreating north from Changsha can escape the Chinese army's heavy encirclement is still questionable. News from the front this morning stated that there are no traces of the Japanese army around Changsha. According to Japanese prisoners, the most valiant Japanese Third and Fourth Divisions were met with a crushing blow by the Chinese army in the Northern Hunan campaign, and their divisional commanders were killed. (2nd Dispatch)

Changsha – The major battle in Northern Hunan reached a decisive stage on the afternoon of the 1st. The entire Japanese force of approximately five divisions that crossed the Miluo River and invaded the south was gradually drawn into a pre-set trap by the Chinese army. Then, various units of the Chinese army cooperated from all sides, heavily encircling the Japanese troops in the Laodao River and Liuyang River areas northeast of Changsha and launching a fierce encirclement attack on the Japanese army. A magnificent and unparalleled annihilation battle commenced at 3 PM on the 30th. The Japanese army, running out of food and ammunition, initially put up a desperate struggle.

### Military Spokesman Discusses Strategic Observations on the Northern Hunan Campaign

Chongqing – A reporter visited the military spokesman on the evening of the 1st to inquire about his strategic observations on the Northern Hunan campaign. The spokesman replied as follows: Judging from the troop strength and unit designations used by the Japanese in this invasion, their total troop strength has reached 130,000 men. The unit designations are the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 13th, 33rd, and 40th Divisions, and the Independent 14th Brigade, etc., mostly active-duty units of their country. They account for one-fourth of the total number of privately trafficked troops in their country, comprising all of their most elite units on the various battlefields in China. China's operational plan and determination against this Japanese army are to lure the Japanese deep into favorable areas and then encircle and annihilate them. The morale of the people in Hunan has always been high. The units engaging the Japanese army in that area are mostly elite troops of the National Army, so both the morale of the troops and the morale of the people are extremely high. The degree of cooperation between the military and the people has also reached its peak. In the past half month of arduous fighting, the Japanese army has surely tasted the heroic combat of our people and recognized the strong killing power of the National Army. Although the battle is not yet over, it can be predicted that the result of this battle, even if it cannot annihilate the entire Japanese army, will certainly inflict unprecedented punishment on them. This is not only a pivotal point in the transition of victory and defeat in the Sino-Japanese War but also an opportunity to stabilize the overall situation in the Far East and guarantee world peace. Because the Japanese army has long been outwardly strong but inwardly weak after four years of attrition by our war, their recent opportunistic maneuvers in the international arena, after suffering this blow, have completely exposed their weaknesses. It is believed that no one in the world will be deceived by them again. There is no doubt that China will win the war. (1st Dispatch)

### Japanese Have Attacked Changsha Three Times, But Have Never Occupied It

Chongqing – All Chinese newspapers today published articles commenting on the victory of the Chinese army in the Battle of Changsha, unanimously stating that this battle dealt a serious blow to the Japanese army, both spiritually and militarily. This is indeed a turning point in the Sino-Japanese War. The newspapers today published many interesting "inside stories" of the Battle of Changsha. Chinese authorities here stated that the Japanese army had attacked Changsha three times but had never actually occupied it. On the evening of September 27, 200 Japanese soldiers disguised as civilians and paratroopers infiltrated Changsha City through the northeast gate but were wiped out by the Chinese army within 24 hours. On the 30th, several hundred more Japanese soldiers disguised as civilians infiltrated the city through the east gate, setting fires in various locations in an attempt to disrupt the Chinese army's rear. At the same time, the Japanese army fiercely bombarded the city, resulting in much of the city being razed to the ground. However, this civilian team was again annihilated by the Chinese army. Yesterday, a detachment of Japanese cavalry rushed to the south gate of Changsha but was repelled by the Chinese army and failed to enter the city. The great victory of the Chinese army this time relied on the calm command of General Xue Yue, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army on the Hunan Front, and the close coordination of the Chinese armies on the neighboring front lines. According to people from all walks of life in China, General Xue had predetermined the strategy before the Japanese army launched its attack and then proceeded accordingly, calmly and unhurriedly. During the battle, he did not leave his headquarters, which was only two miles from Changsha. His troops completely followed his orders. When the Japanese army crossed the Xinqiang River, the general ordered the troops guarding the Xinqiang River and the Miluo River to move to the flanks and rear of the Japanese army. In the initial stages of the battle, he only slightly engaged the Japanese army, ordering his troops to hold the Laodao River line and fiercely defend against the Japanese army's attacks. At the same time, the large army deployed to the flanks and rear of the Japanese army engaged in encircling the Japanese army from behind. The strength of the Japanese army in this attack was estimated to be approximately 150,000 men. The general feared that the strength of the Hunan Front's garrison was insufficient to carry out an annihilation battle, so he requested the Chinese armies in neighboring war zones to participate in the counteroffensive. The general offensive began at 3 PM on September 30 and lasted for 48 hours. The Chinese army fought more and more bravely, finally repelling the Japanese army yesterday afternoon. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, the Japanese army decided to make a general retreat to the north. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)

### The Gains of China's War Effort

In yesterday's edition, this newspaper commented on the war situation in Northern Hunan, stating that the Japanese army's offensive was gradually reaching its limit and had fallen into an encirclement, predicting that their retreat would not be far off. However, the actual development of events has been even faster than our envisioned imaginings. Since the afternoon of September 30, the Chinese army has launched a fierce encirclement attack on the surrounded Japanese army, which has broken through and retreated towards Yuezhou. As expected, the Japanese authorities have stated that the Japanese army began to "shift its front" from Changsha and its vicinity yesterday, "returning to its original posture," with the reason naturally being that "the operational objectives have already been achieved." What the Japanese army's operational objectives actually are, we outsiders cannot know in detail, but judging from the statements made by the Japanese authorities at the beginning of this campaign, it seems that their objectives are far from being achievable by such hasty advances and retreats. According to the genius theorist of war philosophy, Clausewitz, the purpose of war is to disarm a country and eliminate its possibility of resistance. In order to achieve this purpose, it is necessary to destroy the enemy's military force, occupy its territory, and destroy its will. Which of the aforementioned tasks did the Japanese army's actions in Northern Hunan actually accomplish? This is something that the Japanese side needs to explain specifically. Now, China's territory in Northern Hunan is unharmed, its military force is intact, and its will is even more vigorously developing. This is sufficient to prove that the Chinese side's claim that all of these developments are the result of the predetermined strategic development is indeed an unshakable truth.

In fact, the increased strength of China's war effort is not limited to the Battle of Northern Hunan alone. However, recently, the Chinese people have often been overly concerned about various developments on the international front and have paid less attention to the domestic military situation. As a result, they have become accustomed to not noticing this. It is possible that the Japanese army's sudden offensive at this time was aimed at exploiting this weakness and hoping to achieve the effect of catching us off guard. However, in the past month or so, the Chinese armies on various battlefields have all made some new gains. Therefore, the victory in Northern Hunan this time was expected rather than unexpected. Since the bloody battle of Zhongtiaoshan in May, the international situation has become even more turbulent, and the Japanese side, preoccupied with its own affairs, has been relatively quiet in its military actions against China. However, the Chinese armies on various lines have been continuously engaging in attacks, with the greatest gains being made on the eastern battlefield. In late August, the Chinese armies in Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui all mobilized, capturing Baiguan on the 27th, launching fierce attacks on Xiaoshao and other places, and recovering Fuyang, Yuhang, and Wukang. On the Fujian front, Fuching and Lianjiang were captured one after the other, and the important southeastern town of Fuzhou Mawei was recovered on September 3. On September 15, Tongshan was captured in southern Hubei. According to the Japanese side, they may perhaps believe that these strongholds were all "withdrawn after the objectives were achieved." Regardless of the detailed and specific reports of these battles, even in terms of strategic significance, the gain or loss of places like Tongshan and Fuzhou is by no means a trivial matter. Even if we take a step back and temporarily acknowledge that it is indeed the Japanese army's withdrawal, in fact, it is no different from suffering a defeat. As for the Battle of Dayun Mountain in Northern Hunan in early September, when the fierce battle in Changsha was raging, the Japanese side once stated that it was just a feint to the east while attacking in the west. However, since the Chinese army won that battle, it has maintained control of that mountain, posing a significant threat to Yuezhou and serving as a prelude to the victory in this major battle. From the evolution of these battles, it can be confirmed that the strength of the Chinese army is constantly strengthening and growing. Therefore, it can also be seen that the victory in the Battle of Northern Hunan this time was by no means accidental.

Looking back at the past fifty months of warfare, China has certainly made significant sacrifices, but its gains should not be underestimated. The Japanese side's objectives in the war against China have not only failed to be achieved, but have often been counterproductive. For example, annihilating China's main war force, eliminating China's will to fight, preventing China's foreign aid, and cutting off China's foreign transportation lines are all things that the Japanese side has done its best to achieve. Which of these has achieved definite success? In fact, even when the Chinese army suffered repeated defeats in the past and the policy of international appeasement was prevalent, the Japanese side was still unable to realize its ideals. On the other hand, with the passage of time and the evolution of the international situation, China's military strength has become increasingly stronger, its will has become more firm, and international support has developed by leaps and bounds, even exceeding China's own expectations. The rear's foreign transportation has also achieved significant development and improvement, and the distance to Japan's war objectives against China has become farther and farther. In particular, the past gaps between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the legacy of the policy of appeasement, have all been swept away with the evolution of the international situation in the past year. Today, China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are no different from fighting shoulder to shoulder, and China is also a major power in the anti-aggression front of democratic countries. Its ability and role in stabilizing the Far East will become increasingly apparent with the evolution of the war against Japan and the victory in the war. All of these situations are probably facts that the Japanese side is unwilling to face directly but cannot do anything about.

However, this trend of progress is very encouraging. Vigilance cannot be relaxed in the slightest. Even with regard to the many gains we have made in the past, they are all the result of arduous struggle and are by no means accidental. It must be known that the Japanese side is still racking its brains to try to reverse the decline. While China is constantly making progress, there are still some areas, whether in military, political, or economic terms, that have not fully met our ideals. For example, although the recent battles on the eastern battlefield and in Northern Hunan have both achieved significant victories, they are still not sufficient to speak of launching a nationwide initiative for a counteroffensive. This is certainly a matter of weaponry, but it also shows that there is still a need to continue to inspire and strive. Given the strength of Britain's current position, Churchill's speech in Parliament on September 30 still warned against the danger of being invaded. This attitude of not forgetting danger in times of peace is precisely what people should regard as their guiding principle.

### Geomagnetic Observatory of the Academia Sinica Observes the Impact of the Solar Eclipse on Geomagnetism; Excellent Results Obtained

Chongyang – The Geomagnetic Observatory of the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica came to the southeast this time to observe the total eclipse on September 21. It was responsible for observing the impact of the solar eclipse on geomagnetism. Because it was not hindered by the weather, it obtained excellent results. According to the observation results, the strength of the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field weakened during the total solar eclipse, the amplitude increased, and the declination and inclination also changed significantly. This phenomenon is because the radiation emitted by the sun at that time was blocked by the moon, and the current in the high-altitude ionosphere of the Earth's magnetic field weakened accordingly. This is a powerful proof of the ultraviolet light theory. According to the Geomagnetic Observatory of the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica, it is the only organization in China that studies geomagnetism. The working location this time was in the wilderness four kilometers away from the city of Chong'an. A temporary geomagnetic station was specially built, constructed entirely of non-magnetic materials. There are no traces of iron within a radius of about 400 meters around the station, so the observations are very accurate. The institute has now decided to cooperate with the Meteorological Bureau to continue measuring the geomagnetic elements of Fujian Province. (1st Dispatch)

A communique issued by the Soviet government stated that the tripartite conference was held in an atmosphere of complete mutual understanding, trust, and goodwill, and has now successfully completed its work. The completion of the discussions was two months earlier than scheduled. Stalin's sharp and practical mentality was an important factor in the conference. He was familiar with all the details and possibilities, and all participants were impressed. According to Reuters reporters, the tripartite conference has set a new record for conducting business. The six committees studying the various needs of the Soviet army completed their work in only two days. The tripartite conference held a plenary session yesterday afternoon. These rapid developments can confirm the general view that thorough preparation had been made before the talks. The British military and economic missions here have made valuable contributions to this point. All discussions in the conference were rapid, thorough, and effective. Perhaps no other conference in recent years has achieved such great results in such a short period of time. When Soviet spokesman Lozovsky described the conference, he emphatically stated the importance the Soviets attached to the conference and the satisfactory impression of the results of the conference. After the plenary session, the Soviet side hosted the participating representatives in the Kremlin.

### Full Text of Speech by Soviet Representative

Havas Agency, Moscow, 2nd – The full text of the speech by Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet delegation at the Three-Power Conference, is as follows: "Sir Beaverbrook, Mr. Harriman, and gentlemen of the various delegations, in a few days, this conference has successfully completed its work and unanimously passed resolutions on various issues. In this regard, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, I would like to thank the British and American delegations and experts, and especially Sir Beaverbrook and Mr. Harriman, for promoting the success of this conference. Comrade Stalin has also enthusiastically participated in the various tasks completed by the conference. The decisive interests of our great freedom-loving nation have enabled us to cooperate closely and unanimously wage a historic struggle against the Hitlerite bandits who specialize in enslaving other countries. In this regard, we have fully understood this in the past few days. This conference was initiated by modern great statesmen President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill. As is generally known, the purpose of convening this conference is to provide material aid to the Soviet Union and jointly defeat Hitlerism. In this regard, we should note that not only Britain, which is currently at war, but also the United States, which is not at war, has clearly understood the importance of eliminating Hitlerism and assisting the Soviet Union to achieve this goal. No matter how the enemy exaggerates its temporary achievements, the joint efforts of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States have predetermined our final victory. Judging from the resolutions of this conference, it can be seen that material aid to the Soviet Union will be more frequent and expanded in the future, and the shipment of aircraft and tanks to the Soviet Union will also increase day by day. Hitler's calculations have been completely wrong. Hitler has prompted the democratic countries to unite and fight against Nazi hegemony. This is completely unexpected by Hitler. This point is particularly important, because Nazism has not only enslaved several countries, but has also become a serious threat to the countries that are about to be attacked by Germany. At this conference, the British and American representatives were extremely consistent and rapid in resolving the issue of aiding the Soviet Union. Therefore, we can see that the friendly countries have understood that the Soviet Union is indeed shouldering the most important responsibility for fighting against fascism. At the same time, we deeply know that this kind of assistance must be implemented quickly and must be strengthened according to the needs of the war. No matter how the Hitler aggressors intensify the looting of their own people and the conquered countries (including France, which has been ravaged for a year, and Bulgaria, which has been transformed into a base for attacking the Soviet Union), Hitler's plan will still become a bubble. The looting by the Hitler aggressors cannot be compared with the great strength of the three powers that are destroying the cruel Hitlerism. Hitler is the culprit in killing all mankind. In this glorious struggle aimed at defeating Hitler, this conference will occupy an important page. Our hatred for Hitler and Goering and the hope for their failure are of no help. We must eliminate the power of this common enemy of mankind anytime, anywhere, and forever. In order to achieve this goal, we must crush their attempts one by one. The free countries led by the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States have understood the importance of crushing Nazi attempts. This is the political characteristic of this conference. The arrogant Hitler has never encountered such a huge united force. Our great anti-Hitler front will rapidly strengthen, and no force can destroy this front. At the same time, with the establishment of a large alliance of countries, various methods can be found to eliminate the Nazi cancer in Europe and the threat it poses to all freedom-loving nations. It is unfortunate that the Soviet Union has encountered the heaviest blow from the Hitler aggressors. However, our arduous struggle has been recognized by people all over the world. In this regard, we have understood it. Under the guidance of the great leader Comrade Stalin, the Soviet Union has carried out the task of liberation. Its purpose is not only to liberate the people of all of Europe, but also to strive for freedom for the whole world. In this regard, the world will definitely evaluate it, and it is also deeply understood by the representatives of the friendly countries that are assisting the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has encountered attacks from the cruel Hitler Party in more than one place. In this struggle, we have made great sacrifices. Although, our will has never wavered, and it will inevitably become stronger because of this. Although our country's war against fascism is extremely difficult, our army has become a formidable force that can definitely defend the country and the people. Our country's struggle against Hitler's Germany has won the approval of the people of all countries, because they have confirmed that the Soviet Union is fighting for the freedom and independence of all countries. For this reason, the sympathy and assistance of freedom-loving countries to our country has been rapidly increasing. I hereby, on behalf of the Soviet government and the people of the Soviet Union, make a guarantee to the British and American representatives: "Our will to oppose Hitler's Germany cannot be subdued by any force, and our confidence in obtaining victory over the common enemy of mankind is unshakable."

### Contents of American Representative's Speech

TASS, Moscow, 2nd – At the powerful conference on October 1st, Harriman, representing the United States, and Beaverbrook, spoke as follows: The conference of representatives of the three countries of the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States has come to an end. The purpose of the representatives coming here is to examine the issue of supplies from Britain and the United States to the Soviet Union during the course of the Soviet Union's war against the Axis countries. The conference was chaired by the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and began discussions on Monday. With regard to the conference's review of the issue of the Soviet Union's existing resources and the output of Britain and the United States, it has been decided to supply all the necessities required by the Soviet Union's military and political authorities. On the other hand, the Soviet government will supply the two countries with the raw materials urgently needed by Britain and the United States. The transportation issue has also been reviewed, and a plan has been drafted by the conference to expand transportation routes in all aspects. Stalin has authorized myself and Lord Beaverbrook to express our gratitude for the various forms of assistance from Britain and the United States. This assistance is very extensive and will definitely strengthen the Soviet Union's defense and assist the Red Army in counterattacking the aggressors. I hereby, on behalf of my country's government and Lord Beaverbrook, certify that Britain and the United States have obtained sufficient raw materials from the Soviet government. These raw materials will definitely increase our country's military output. The spirit of this conference was extremely harmonious. Therefore, the conference has successfully concluded in a short period of time. We must also solemnly state Stalin's sympathetic cooperation and understanding in the conference. At the same time, we are deeply grateful for the efforts of Molotov and other Soviet representatives.

Reuters, London, 2nd – Although early winter snow has fallen on both the northern and southern ends of the Soviet Union, the German army still appears to be intensifying its offensives in Leningrad and Ukraine. Recent Soviet communiqués only stated that on the evening of October 1, Soviet troops continued to engage in fierce battles with the enemy along the entire front. After snowfall in the area of Leningrad, there have been reports that Germany is rushing reinforcements. Soviet troops have launched vigorous counterattacks to the east of the city, with considerable success. According to a commander of the Baltic Fleet, Soviet ships are now giving the German army not a moment of peace. Our resistance is growing stronger day by day, and our troops are also increasing day by day. There is no new news today regarding the counteroffensive by General Timoshenko's forces in the central region. However, in Ukraine, it is reported that the German army has used gliders for the first time. According to dispatches from Moscow last night, the Black Sea Fleet has shot down several gliders. In the Crimea, fierce battles continue on the isthmus leading to the peninsula.

### Red Army in Leningrad Breaks Through Enemy Lines in Four Places; German Army Makes Little Progress in Crimea; Finnish Army Reportedly Occupies Capital of Karelia

United Press, London, 2nd – A correspondent in the Swedish capital of Dagens Nyheter reports that Soviet troops in Leningrad have broken through the German lines surrounding the city in four places and have completely repulsed the right wing of General Liep's forces. It is reported that Soviet troops have attacked the German army along a 30-mile front from Koropino to Schlisselburg across the Neva River. Koropino is 20 miles southeast of Leningrad, and Schlisselburg is on the shore of Lake Ladoga.

Reuters, Moscow, 2nd – When answering questions from reporters today, Lord Beaverbrook said that the Soviet people are indeed very happy. I do not want to over-flatter their attitude, but they have indeed understood our problems. He and the chief American representative Harriman both said that they had brought personal letters from British Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt to Stalin, and that the findings of the various committees would be compiled into a final report. Harriman said that Stalin's work had great speed, accuracy, and realism, and was full of patience. He emphasized that all delegations were able to recognize the need for speed, and he hoped that the conference could be shortened even further. The speed at which materials were delivered to the Soviet Union could be seen in the speed of this conference.

Reuters, London, 2nd – German attempts to capture Odessa have so far failed. It is now reported that the German army has used giant aircraft to tow gliders, carrying troops to attempt to recapture Odessa, as was done in Crete. However, the Soviet side said that some of these troop-carrying aircraft have been shot down. In the northern sector, a Soviet officer wrote in the Red Star newspaper that it is estimated that 100,000 German soldiers have been killed or wounded in the two sectors of the Leningrad battlefield, and 400 tanks and over 800 aircraft have been lost. The German blitzkrieg against Leningrad has ended in a miserable defeat, but the city is still in serious danger and a terrible battle will take place. In Ukraine, the German army, advancing from Poltava, is probing the Kharkov industrial area and is believed to have made some progress. In the Crimea, in the great battle on the twelve-mile-wide isthmus, the German army appears to have advanced to within seven miles south of Perekop. The German side claims that German aircraft have again bombed Moscow, but the Soviet side only reports that in the past few months, German aircraft attempting to attack Moscow have lost 170 aircraft. Recent Soviet communiqués still state that Soviet troops engaged the enemy along the entire front yesterday, and that 26 enemy aircraft were destroyed on September 29 and 9 Soviet aircraft were lost. On September 30, a German reconnaissance aircraft was shot down near Moscow.

Reuters, Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd – Reports from Finland state that Soviet troops, who launched a fierce attack near Leningrad yesterday, have occupied a town in the suburbs. It is estimated that one million Soviet troops are surrounded in Leningrad, with a large number of tanks and artillery. After a fierce bombardment by Soviet artillery on Monday night, Soviet armored divisions attempted to break through the German lines to the east of the city, but were hindered by newly laid minefields by the German army. At the same time, Soviet troops attacked in other areas to prevent the German army from advancing. Finnish sources only mentioned their already announced victories and said that they had cut off the connection between the Murmansk and Syvr rivers, leaving only two poor roads still available to supply Soviet troops in the northern sector. Messages from Berlin stated the difficulties of German transportation, but said that these difficulties have now been overcome. It also said that it will now be necessary to engage in a winter war in the Soviet Union, but that the German side has already made special preparations for winter warfare in the autumn.

Havas, Soviet border area, 1st – On the 102nd day of the German-Soviet war, the major trends on the various fronts are as follows: (1) Northern Front: Finnish troops have occupied Petrozavodsk, the capital of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The city has a population of 50,000 and is a station on the railway to the port of Murmansk. Before retreating, the Red Army resisted with all its might and transported away all the machinery from the factories. The battle situation in the far north is now centered on the port of Murmansk. As for the Red Army in Leningrad, it still launches surprise attacks from time to time, despite being heavily besieged. On the night of July 29, the Red Army concentrated hundreds of tanks and broke through the German lines to the east of the city. Tank and air force units from both sides engaged in fierce battles for several days. Generally speaking, the situation in the area has not changed since the 19th of last month. The German army seems to be waiting for the morale of the defenders to be demoralized before launching a final attack. At the same time, the German army has also transported a batch of heavy artillery to the Petrodvorets coast to bombard the Soviet naval base of Kronstadt. (2) Central Front: Under the command of General Timoshenko, the Red Army has launched a counteroffensive, diverting part of the German army's forces. The German army is now welcoming and resisting from different directions. (3) Southern Front: Italian troops are advancing towards Kharkov in Ukraine. The Red Army has dispatched hundreds of tanks in the area, and both sides are engaged in fierce battles.

### Red Army Achieves Another Great Victory in the Central Sector, Defeating a German Infantry Division

TASS, Western Front, 2nd – On September 27, a regiment of the German 292nd Infantry Division and the 268th Infantry Division, which had been reorganized after being defeated in Ilyino, launched an offensive in the S River area. On the 28th, the Red Army, under the command of Bobrov, began a counteroffensive against the enemy. Artillery, aircraft, and tank units assisted the infantry in repeatedly striking the enemy. After three days of fierce fighting, the 268th German Infantry Division was finally defeated. More than 1,800 corpses of Nazi soldiers were left on the battlefield. Our army seized a large number of spoils of war, including eight cannons, fifteen machine guns, five small cannons, more than 600 landmines, four radio stations, countless rifles, bicycles, and other military documents. The total number of spoils of war has not yet been counted. In the pockets of the dead and captured German soldiers, the Red Army found a large number of items looted from peaceful civilians, such as silk stockings, shirts, etc. Everything that could be looted was there. The remnants of the defeated German infantry division were driven back to their original positions.

### Britain to Intensify Air Offensive Against Italy

Reuters, London, 2nd – According to parliamentary members, the British side will intensify its air offensive against Italy. The intensification will be in the general strength of the British air force offensive, and targets may not necessarily be selected for intensified attacks. Various questions were raised in the House of Commons yesterday regarding this matter. The government side answered that questioners could refer to Churchill's remarks on Sunday.

### Britain's Warning to Finland Remains Unanswered

Reuters, London, 2nd – Foreign Secretary Eden said in the House of Commons yesterday that the British government has not yet received a response from the Finnish government after warning it that if Finland persists in invading Soviet territory, Britain will be forced to treat Finland as an open enemy. Liberal MP Mander asked if the British side had a time limit for the Finnish government's response and whether it should not be allowed to delay indefinitely. Eden replied, "I would prefer to handle this kind of negotiation in my own way." (Cheers)

### Cotton Yarn Flower: Cotton Yarn Market Overwhelms, Shorts Lack Resistance, Spot Market Sees 1885 Yuan, Futures Absorption Strong, Jump of 40 Yuan

The yarn market continues to be strong, with an exceptionally high rate of increase. This is because the cost of raw materials is rising steadily, leading to a daily increase in factory costs. Demand from Southeast Asia continues unabated. Factories, due to the high price of raw cotton, find it extremely difficult to sell. As a result, there is a shortage of many spot goods. Actual trading developments involve accepting orders from Southeast Asia and sourcing Double Horse factory orders from the market, transferring the yarn from factories for shipment and export. As a result, warehouse receipts are being collected daily, and the number of chips in the market is becoming increasingly tight. The amount released by shorts is quite substantial. Under such circumstances, near closing time, buyers are trying to borrow warehouse receipts but are unable to obtain enough. Aside from offsetting at market prices, there is no other way, and they lack the ability to resist. On the other hand, they are re-entering the market to roll over positions overnight. Therefore, the premium for shorts is very high. This morning, each package of shorts paid a premium of three to four dimes to the longs. In the afternoon, it increased to one yuan, but it was not enough to roll over the full amount, indicating the scarcity of warehouse receipts. 20-count doubles were priced as high as 1,860 yuan and as low as 1,846 yuan. The off-market price was 1,861-2 yuan. The initial afternoon price was 1,865 yuan, then weakened to 1,860 yuan. News that the exchange's cloth prices were jumping caused excitement and panic, and buyers covered their positions at market prices. The market floor was chaotic, and shouts reverberated, from 60 yuan to 70 yuan, directly reaching 1,885 yuan. However, as some profit-takers sold, it loosened to 1,877 yuan, but at the close, it rebounded to 1,880 yuan. Off-market trading was tight at 1,883 yuan, with speculative trades at 1,881-2 yuan. Today, 850 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened strongly, as last night's prices had already turned upward. The opening price was 1,852 yuan, rising directly to 1,860 yuan. However, profit-takers sold, and shorts became active, causing it to loosen to 1,818 yuan. At this time, the shorts on the floor were under heavy pressure. However, the exchange price initially rose and then weakened. Therefore, the longs were watching, while the sellers were quite active. The market fluctuated between 1,856 yuan and 1,848-9 yuan, within a range of ten yuan. Subsequently, near noon, the shorts felt the pressure of chips was particularly tight and actively covered their positions. The market suddenly turned upward in the last five minutes, and the closing price was 1,858 yuan. However, the off-market price reached 1,862 yuan, with few sellers. The daily transaction statistics showed 15,070 bales traded. The amount bought by each gang is listed below:

Hong Kong 50, Southeast Asia 2, Dealers 15,000, Total 15,070

The Golden Double Horse futures market is trending upwards, and the momentum is expanding. The hearts of all gangs are boiling, and the absorption is lively, setting a record since the market opened. This is due to the sharp rise in US cotton and the strong increase in factory orders. New high prices are emerging one after another. In addition, the violent rise in the exchange has further aroused the excitement of buyers and the panic of shorts. Therefore, futures yarn is soaring on the strength of the market, and new peaks are constantly emerging. The long-held shorts are under intense pressure from all sides and seem unable to support themselves. As a result, the floor is becoming increasingly firm, completely dominated by buying sentiment, leading to a near-high closing price. The morning opening already showed signs of a strong advance. October futures were at 1,732 yuan, up 3 yuan. November was even stronger, at 1,745 yuan, a sudden increase of 2.5 yuan. December futures were at 1,769 yuan, also up 10.05 yuan. Although there was a slight pullback at one point, it was quickly pulled higher. In the afternoon, as spot goods continued to trend upward, shorts increased their efforts to cover, and the market became increasingly firm, surging more than 30 yuan. The firmness of the base is rare. If mixed brands and factory orders do not see a reversal, then futures yarn should also see further gains. However, if it encounters a setback, then a pullback is inevitable. New longs should pay particular attention to this. As a result, near and far-term futures both soared by more than 40 yuan. The market activity is listed below:

### Yarn and Cloth Continue Upward, Cotton Merchants' Expectations Rise, 6,000+ Bales of Indian Cotton Arrive

The current cotton situation is experiencing a sharp rise, resulting in the emergence of new peaks. This is due to the weak inventory of raw cotton spot goods. At the same time, yarn and cloth continue to rise, and expectations are very high. Holders of goods are keeping them tightly held. However, the factory's yarn sales are picking up, and intentions are gradually emerging. As a result, sentiment is improving. The price of 33-count raw material Peng Jia Pu has risen above the 600 yuan mark. Although the market price is high, the desire to sell is quite weak.

A large batch of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng Wheel arrived last night, carrying a large batch of cotton from Hong Kong, totaling 5,636 bales, and was unloaded at the Rochefort Wharf. This cotton was shipped from Bombay to Hong Kong and then transshipped to Shanghai.

The New York cotton market rose due to purchases by peers and New Orleans futures purchases. Furthermore, unfavorable short-term cotton production harvest statistics led to active covering. As a result, closing prices surged by 40 to 50 points per pound.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to profit-taking by longs and selling by speculators. Subsequently, it rebounded due to purchases by European exporters and continuous covering by yarn factories. Yesterday's closing prices rose by 1 to 4 rupees. It is also predicted that today's opening market conditions will rise by 4.75 rupees due to the strong gains in US cotton.

### Grains: The Rice Market Situation, Still Struggling

Yesterday's rice market initially weakened and then rose, with prices continuing to consolidate. The opening price of foreign rice in the morning was still fair, and profit-taking was seen in view of sufficient inventory. Public sales were able to obtain foreign exchange assistance, allowing for a steady stream of arrivals. Furthermore, 58,000 bags of warehouse rice had been sold at a low price. Therefore, initially, sellers were still trying to maintain prices, and scalping was still active. At the time, the situation was quite tight, but because each market had already risen sufficiently, it was not easy to rise further, and they often hovered around the original prices. Banks and warehouses were still offering 118.2 yuan and 118 yuan, while foreign warehouses were offering 118 yuan. At this point, some floating holders took advantage of the flat prices to sell, and the market showed signs of weakness. Small-pattern transactions returned to 117.5 yuan and 117 yuan, but in an instant, large buyers absorbed the supply, and prices returned to their original levels. At this time, spot buyers who had been watching for a long time, seeing that the market was firm and unwavering, also stepped forward to add to their positions. As a result, No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon and Siamese goods, due to the scarcity of market goods, were more concentrated than small-pattern transactions, and prices were strong. The result of the closing price statistics was that No. 1 Saigon high-quality goods reached 134-5 yuan, medium-quality goods were 133.5 yuan, and low-quality goods were 131 yuan. No. 2 goods were 123.5 yuan and 121 yuan. No. 1 Siamese goods were 131 yuan and 129 yuan, and No. 2 goods were 118 yuan, down to 115.5 yuan. Min Dang medium-quality goods were 128 yuan and 125 yuan, and high-quality goods were 133 yuan. Java sharp goods were 120 yuan, and high-quality goods were 133 yuan. Rice tea was 97 yuan, and broken sharp goods were 95 yuan, down to 91.5 yuan.

New domestic rice and new sharp rice have been arriving steadily, and it is expected that the flow will gradually increase in the future. Therefore, they have remained flat amidst the rising prices of old rice and foreign rice. Yesterday, 120 bags of Kunshan new rice arrived, priced at 151 yuan, down to 146 yuan. 124 yuan for new Yang sharp rice, and 130 bags of new Du sharp rice, a total of 6-70 bags, the price is similar to the previous market. However, the inventory of old rice in the north road is exhausted, and only a small batch of more than ten piculs of early thin rice arrived. The owners of the goods are holding out for higher prices, and sentiment is upward. The price has risen sharply to 155-6 yuan, which is 4-5 yuan higher than the previous day. There is a shortage of Du Yuan rice, and foreign yuan rice is being exchanged. 250 bags of domestic rice, 10,000 bags of foreign rice, and another 500 tons arrived.

The former French postal ship General Chaffey brought a large quantity of foreign rice from Saigon. It is now known that the ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. It is now known that it is actually corn, totaling 29,698 bags. (Zu)

### Flour Market Stable, 580 Cases of Tobacco Silk Arrived from Tianjin Yesterday

Yesterday's foreign flour market opened fairly stable in the morning. The selling prices of American and Canadian flours were close to the previous close. The market had no major fluctuations given sufficient inventory and a balance between supply and demand. However, local retail sales have not yet shown signs of decline, and speculators are absorbing the supply and engaging in scalping transactions while prices are flat. Moreover, with rising prices for oil, rice, and all goods, the solid base of flour is particularly favored by those with an eye for business. The market is gradually improving amidst active trade, but there are still profit-takers selling. Large customer orders have not yet been inquired about. As a result, the closing price was up two or three cents from the night before. Battery brand flour opened at 35.15 yuan, rose to 35.25 yuan in the afternoon, and closed at 35.4 yuan. Jinlong West Warehouse was at 33.25 yuan in the morning, rose to 33.45 yuan in the afternoon, and closed at 33.3 yuan. East Warehouse was at 33.78 yuan, Banana at 34.7 yuan, Green Treasure at 34.65 yuan, and Flying Scissors at 32.5 yuan. The after-market also saw bids at higher prices. Wheat shortages are also tight.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Owners Raise Prices, Market Rises Another Five Yuan

Speculation on soybeans has suddenly intensified. This is because, while the arrival of goods is not high, owners are taking advantage of high oil prices to significantly raise prices, forcing spot buyers to raise prices in order to obtain supplies. As a result, the market has risen sharply by three to five yuan. Market transactions included 150 bags of Tianjin Jin Yuan, more than 250 bags of Guide soybeans, more than 200 bags of Qingkou soybeans, and one cart of Changzhou Niupi beans.

In addition, 688 bags of raw peanuts and 200 bags of beans were shipped from Tianjin yesterday. Today, 230 bags of sesame and 1,200 cakes of bean cakes were shipped to Xiamen.

### Oil Cakes: Rice Weevils and Cotton Gangs Wreak Havoc on the Oil Market, Prices Rise Sharply by 10 Yuan, Taking a Hands-Off Approach

Yesterday, speculation in edible oil became increasingly heated. Rice weevils openly displayed their magic, and cotton gangs and brokers also helped each other, causing the oil market regulars to lose control and retreat instead. Cottonseed oil and rapeseed oil surged by as much as ten yuan under the manipulation of outsiders. Raw soybean oil was also in demand. A certain party of the Dada Oil Company, which was in contact for business, also took the opportunity to raise prices and refused to sell cheaply. This kind of futures oil trading is enough to disrupt the official market, and the person in charge is taking a laissez-faire attitude, and it is unknown what the intention is. The total market sold 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil and Yantai soybean oil, and 1,000 cans of Yantai listening soybean oil. Daya Factory has more than 20,000 piculs of clear oil futures, and Rihua Factory has more than 1,000 barrels of rapeseed oil futures. (Prices are detailed in the market price column)

### Finance: Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rate Loosens, Spot and Futures Markets Rise

Yesterday's black market, spot and futures both saw price increases. Because the private regular price of Shanghai exchange was not as loose and cheap as the previous day, the hearts of all parties were inevitably firm. The current exchange rate has not been transmitted on time, causing uneasiness among operators. Spot gold shops and foreign exchange dealers sold, pressing down twice to 7,560 yuan. Soon after, they were absorbed by Xiang Xing Yong, Ming Feng, Heng Ji, Dingsheng and others in succession, rising several times to 7,590 yuan, and finally pushed up 30 yuan. The total daily transaction was about 3,800 taels. Spot transactions were rare. First, He Sheng Jin Yi Da sold ten taels, and the price rose to 9,300 yuan, a high of 20 yuan. Suddenly, Da Feng Lai sold Ming Feng forty taels, and Cheng Ji sold Xiang He sixty taels, both at 9,290 yuan. Da Feng also sold twenty taels, and Xiang Xing Yong sold ten taels, all bought by Shun Yuan, retreating to 9,280 yuan. In the afternoon, Da Feng sold Cheng Ji fifty taels for 9,300 yuan, up 20 yuan from the previous day. The high and low of the day was also 20 yuan, and less than 100 taels were traded. The price of gold from local gold shops was 9,350 yuan, and the purchase price was 300 yuan lower than the selling price. Ornaments remained flat.

Futures gold up 30 yuan

Futures gold opened this morning for each bar (ten taels). Because He Sheng, a spot gold shop, bought first, the market rose to 7,590 yuan at 9:30, an increase of 32 yuan. Yu Xing Yong and Hong Qing Yong sold, and the market retreated to 7,570 yuan. Yi Li bought and lifted the price to 7,580 yuan. Soon after, they sold out. Jin Yuan, Shi He, and Yong Cheng all sold, and the price fell by 10 yuan, retreating to 7,560 yuan. Xiang Xing Yong and Ming Feng bought and sold back and forth, and the price gradually rose. At noon, the price rose again to 7,590 yuan, and Tian Yuan sold. The market closed at noon at 7,585 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon and rose 5 yuan, to a total of 7,590 yuan. Da Lai, Xin Feng, Xiang Xing Yong, and Tong Kang Yong successively sold, and the price fell by 30 yuan, retreating to 7,560 yuan. Because He Sheng, Heng Ji, and Yi Yuan bought in, the price was raised again, and Jin Yuan advanced to 7,590 yuan. The market then retreated slightly to 7,585 yuan, and finally Dingsheng bought in, closing at 7,588 yuan at 4:30, an increase of 30 yuan from the closing price of the previous day. The high and low of the day was also 30 yuan.

Ornamental gold remains unchanged

The selling price of gold ornaments per tael at Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang is still listed at 950 yuan, and the purchase price is reduced by 50 yuan.

### Black Market Returns to Calm

The foreign exchange market yesterday showed that the Central Bank and HSBC both listed the same prices. HSBC's small counter price was unchanged. The black market for British and American exchange rates gradually returned to calm. The British exchange rate was difficult to generate a market price. There were short positions sold at 4.5 yuan for American exchange, and importers who were not allowed to apply for foreign exchange at 4.625 yuan were trying to settle their positions. No transactions were heard all day. The closing price of British exchange was 2/8125, and the American exchange rate was 4.5 yuan, both flat.

Tianjin, 2nd (Thursday) Electric, the exchange market opened this morning announced a flat. The telegraphic transfers of London and New York were still unchanged. The "Joint Notes" dark market also stood at the original level, only the Shanghai exchange rate fell by nine cents to 90 yuan.

### No Major Fluctuations in Foreign Currencies

American gold notes rose slightly by two cents, and rose to 12.52 yuan in the evening market. Hong Kong notes trended steadily, and the market price stood flat. Japanese remittance notes still stood at the original price of 2.36 yuan. Korean remittance notes tended to decline again, and retreated to 1.03 yuan in the evening market.

### Securities: Sichuan Gang's Actions Significantly Affect the Bond Market

The public bond dark market yesterday suddenly saw the Sichuan gang selling a large amount again. The market price, which was originally bullish, was hit hard, which was unexpected. The midday close was down 567 cents. It is unknown where the Sichuan gang's goods came from. Each sale was a spot delivery, with no lending or other conditions. The outflow of spot goods in recent weeks has been quite considerable, and sales have stopped in the last day or two, allowing the market price to recover slowly. A sale yesterday morning caused another decline, and no sales in the afternoon caused a rebound of 345 cents. From this, it can be seen that the potential is still strong with the long positions. The situation in Changsha has turned advantageous, and the future of the bond market is not easy to underestimate. Yesterday morning, Xinfu and Yitai and a group of retail investors bought in, while Houde and Baolong sold out in large numbers. Hengkang and Hongda's sales were also not weak. Class C bonds opened at two yuan and saw a market price of 05 cents. Afterwards, it slowly declined to 1.4 yuan. The closing price of the day was lower. There were fewer transactions in the afternoon. Sichuan gang sales only included Shengda 90% and Xie Xing Yuan. Yitai and Renfeng bought in. Class C bonds returned to two yuan, and the closing price advanced again, closing at 1.75 yuan. As a result, the market price increased by 3 cents, and the rest decreased slightly by about 2 cents. The transaction was about 156 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading, transaction A, 500 shares of underwear company, price 12.75 yuan.

The stock market of various industries is very active, and new high prices have been seen for many stocks. When each stock rises, there is almost no reaction. British Union stock opened at 43 yuan, and after opening, it went straight to 46.5 yuan. Rubber stocks were also quite firm.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday's sugar market continued to trend upward, but Chebai was weaker. The association's closing price for 24 coarse white sugar imported in the previous month was initially 149.5 yuan to 151 yuan, and 150.08 yuan to 151 yuan in the afternoon, up 1.5 yuan. Imports in August were 149.5 yuan to 150.05 yuan, and 150.02 yuan to 150 yuan in the afternoon, up 1.5 yuan. Imports in July were 149 yuan to 150 yuan, and 149.8 yuan to 149 yuan in the afternoon, up 1.4 yuan. Hong Kong coarse was 140.05 yuan to 142 yuan, 141.2 yuan, and 140.5 yuan in the afternoon, and then to 141 yuan, up 5 cents. Taikoo Chebai B mark was 162 yuan, down 1 yuan. The futures price for coarse white company's Double Tenth Festival was 146.5 yuan, a high of 149 yuan to 148.5 yuan, and 148.6 yuan to 148.8 yuan in the afternoon, closing at 148.6 yuan, up 2.8 yuan. The 20th period was 151 yuan to 150 yuan, 149.5 yuan, and 150 yuan, 151.5 yuan to 151.1 yuan in the afternoon, closing still at 151.1 yuan, up 2.3 yuan.

A small amount of granulated sugar also arrived in Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng wheel arrived the night before, and in addition to carrying a large amount of cotton, there were also 500 bags of granulated sugar.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Speculation is Raging, Prices Rise Sharply by 1-2 Yuan

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market continued to trend upward, due to enthusiastic sentiment and rampant speculation. However, retail sales were slightly sluggish, because the purchase of cloths still need to wait for ship reports. The selling price of white coarse cloth rose by 5 cents to 1 yuan per bolt, and the price of fine twill cloth rose by about 1 yuan. The quoted price of bleached and dyed cloth was uneven, and it also rose by about 1 yuan. More than 500 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled more than 300 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill coarse cloth, etc. The Southeast Asian and foreign gangs handled more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, twill cloth, etc. Today, 42 pieces of piece goods are being shipped to Xiamen and 895 pieces are being shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: The rising trend continued fiercely. The Dragon Head futures cloth on the exchange rose continuously in the morning and afternoon, rising by 1.7 yuan to 1.9 yuan per bolt. This is because there is a severe shortage of various mixed-brand fine cloth spot goods on the market, and the grade proportions are too different. Seeing that the situation was not good, shorts scrambled to cover their positions, and new longs increased their bets, so the direct money rose, repeatedly setting new prices. The spot market price of fine cloth rose by about 1.5 yuan per bolt. The Dragon Head New Factory order has been sold for 63.65 yuan, and the accumulated stock of fine twill is becoming increasingly depleted, rising by about 2 yuan. The highest price for colored goods Four Gentlemen Serge New Order was 2.35 yuan, and the closing price was 2.3475 yuan.

### Grass Green Woolen Cloth is Selling Well

Grass green medium-thick serge, thin plain serge, grass green riding breeches, gabardine, and Yizhou have been selling well and actively recently. Customer gangs, such as those in the mainland and guerrilla areas, have needs. Although both sides have strict control, and it is difficult to obtain transportation and sales permits, due to strong retail sales, they are still trying their best to transport and sell.

### Metals: New Bar Yuan Continue to Decline

The market trend of the latest new bar yuan has been sluggish because the customer gangs in other ports are quiet. Furthermore, the nail factories on this street, seeing the leisure of their production of capital nail tongs, naturally lack interest in raw materials. Therefore, the spot sales of new bar yuan have been greatly hit. In addition, there are few scavengers, only the lead wire factories and screw factories on this street. As a result, actual transactions are not as good as before, and the standard market is also gradually declining. The current market is offering to sell at 250 yuan per picul, while the secret price is 247-8 yuan, which is also traded, a drop of 3-5 yuan from the previous market's sales.

In addition, 48 pieces of galvanized iron arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Miscellaneous Items: Matches and Soap are Slightly Tight

The market situation for daily necessities is becoming increasingly tight. This is because the delivery of goods from various factories is nowhere in sight. Hoarders are watching the market and selling, and retail sales are more frequent. New hoarders have begun to absorb the supply again, so the market is quite tense. The opening price of Phoenix brand matches has risen to 1,090 yuan per box, and Beautiful brand is 1,140 yuan, up 80 yuan to 100 yuan from before. The supply of soap is relatively scarce, and the market is slightly tight. Gu Ben soap is 60 yuan, Bai Xiang Mao soap is 50 yuan, and Huang Xiang Mao soap is 47.3 yuan. The opening price has risen by 5 cents to 1 yuan per box. Since the factory stopped issuing warehouse receipts for foreign candles a long time ago, the market has turned around to this day, because spot sales are in season, causing prices to be higher than before. Beli's Sailboat brand is priced at 37.5 yuan per box.

### Industry Representatives Go to Hong Kong to Negotiate Supply of Foreign Exchange, Shanghai Communications and China Banks Cancel Commercial Exchange Rate, Many Export Drafts Not Sold as Ordered

According to reliable news obtained yesterday, the Exchange Stabilization Fund recently sent a telegram to Shanghai, informing each bank authorized to operate foreign exchange that the October exchange settlement method would be handled in accordance with the original regulations without any changes. It was also announced that if various industries believed that it was necessary to raise special issues, the fund was very willing to listen to and accept their opinions. It is now known that in addition to the representatives of the insurance industry, piece goods industry, and film merchants, who have already gone to Hong Kong in recent days, the industries that are preparing to send representatives to the south include the cotton industry, automobile industry, and tobacco industry. The purpose of their trip is nothing more than to explain the difficult situation that each industry cannot develop, hoping that the Exchange Stabilization Fund can increase the supply of a corresponding amount of foreign exchange. At the same time, it is heard that some American merchants will send a telegram to Washington, expressing their support for the Exchange Stabilization Fund's work in stabilizing the currency system and hoping to provide assistance with the restrictions on trade. In short, the focus of the problem has shifted to Hong Kong. After the representatives of the various industries meet with Mr. Fox, the American member of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, and other committees, a decision can be obtained.

Weighing the Importance of Minor Issues

A Western expatriate named Dizzy said, "I recently heard that a large number of merchants went to Hong Kong to negotiate with the Exchange Stabilization Fund. This is really good news, because in the current difficult situation, perhaps some practical solutions can be found. Importers are currently encountering some major difficulties. It should be known that most importers are still trying their best to maintain their business and retain their necessary employees. If the import industry cannot continue, we should be informed as soon as possible so that we can implement layoffs and reduce the scope of business. The merchants who went to Hong Kong this time should ask the Exchange Stabilization Fund authorities to treat goods ordered by legitimate businesses before August 20 and goods ordered after this period separately and specially approve the exchange settlement at a preferential exchange rate." Also, the English-language financial and commercial weekly claimed that eliminating the Shanghai black market is part of the policy of restricting Japanese trade. In fact, Chinese and foreign businesses are inevitably adversely affected by this, but this is only accidental. Regardless of the restriction policy, difficulties are inevitable when it is implemented. The crux of the problem is who suffers the most.

Japanese Export Ban Not Very Important

The report also addressed the issue of the Japanese authorities having banned the export of any goods from Shanghai to Free China, saying that "This order has no major significance at present, because trade between Shanghai and Hong Kong is open as usual, and goods supplied to Free China can of course still be transported to their destination via Hong Kong. However, in general, the flow of goods to Free China is slightly hindered."

Exchange Settlement in Accordance with Exchange Stabilization Fund Rate

In order to unify the foreign exchange management mechanism, the Ministry of Finance specially announced the cancellation of the original commercial exchange rates of 4 1/2 yuan for British exchange and 7.5 yuan for American exchange, and uniformly quoted prices according to the exchange rate set by the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee on August 18. A reporter from Xin Sheng Agency learned from the banking industry yesterday that the China Communications Bank and the China Bank have complied with the ministerial order, but the Central Bank still quotes prices according to the legal exchange rate (British exchange at 1 shilling and 2 1/2 pennies, American exchange at 30 US dollars). Although the application for foreign exchange for imported goods and the sale of foreign exchange for export goods are calculated in accordance with the legal exchange rate in name, in reality, due to the existence of the new exchange rate of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, in order to protect the interests of importers and exporters, they are specially allowed to receive the difference between the legal exchange rate and the Exchange Stabilization Fund rate. Therefore, the result is no different from calculating directly according to the Exchange Stabilization Fund rate. However, it is necessary to always maintain the legal exchange rate and the regulations for receiving the foreign exchange difference.

Export Drafts Must Not Be Concealed

The Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee stipulates that merchants who rely on obtaining foreign exchange from the Exchange Stabilization Fund through authorized or specially licensed banks should sell all export drafts to the banks designated above. If merchants do not comply with this regulation, the Exchange Stabilization Fund will not supply foreign exchange. The Exchange Stabilization Fund will also not supply foreign exchange to importers and exporters who engage in related transactions. The regulations require that they be submitted separately to the Hong Kong office of the Exchange Stabilization Fund for review every week. Since the implementation, the first and second batches have been approved for the supply of foreign exchange. Due to procedural reasons, each batch takes about a week or more. Merchants in the free area have complied with the regulations regarding the sale and settlement of export drafts to banks, but exporters in Shanghai have not yet complied. The Exchange Stabilization Fund has decided to take action in accordance with the established methods.

### Qian's Discussion on Painting By Qin Meng
The painter Qian Ding has been studying oil painting for nearly thirty years, while also working on traditional Chinese painting, watercolor painting, and pencil drawing. He has traveled to almost every famous mountain and great river. He has thoroughly grasped the secrets of both Western and Chinese painting theories. He has a resolute demeanor and a humble and eager-to-learn attitude. One does not see such qualities often in today's artists. Recently, he has been co-hosting an oil painting exhibition with Zhou Bichu and Zhu Qizhan at the Great New World Painting Gallery. Yesterday, a reporter visited his studio. After offering clear tea, they engaged in a pleasant conversation. Qian's opinions are often unprecedented. This reporter is not talented, and also stands outside the world of painting, but since the principles of various art forms are often the same, obtaining his insights from the lonely art world is no different from hearing welcome news in an empty valley. Therefore, I took up my pen to record it.

### Reflecting Life
According to Qian, "The expression of art should be a reflection of one's own life. Paint what you like, paint what you love, paint what you feel. Let your inspiration resonate and interact with nature, and let all the vitality and beauty be present within. Otherwise, it becomes an inorganic painting, lacking a soul, even if it has skillful brushwork. A painter's spirit should be 'what the sword points to, the feet reach, the eyes see, and the brush paints.' Most of us who create traditional Chinese paintings neglect this principle. We imitate the paintings of the ancients, read the paintings of the ancients, and seek the ways of the ancients to use for ourselves. However, times change, environments transform, and if we stick to outdated methods, how many can create era-defining achievements? In my humble opinion, painting methods can be divided into Chinese and Western. Apart from expressing spirituality, the premise should be to reflect the things and scenes of the times as much as possible."

### Expressing Spirituality
"In addition to reviewing the old, we must strive to learn the new. The way to learn the new is to gain experience through personal experience. The ancients said, 'Read ten thousand books and travel ten thousand miles,' and that is what they meant. It is the same for painters. Hear more, see more, experience the situation firsthand, and seek reality widely. In this day and age, the world is interconnected, and traveling ten thousand miles is not difficult. However, one must have a purpose when traveling. From Asia to Europe and America, from Shanghai to Australia and the Philippines, or traveling around the globe, with the convenience of today's transportation, the time taken is short and the distance covered is great. However, this cannot be considered seeing and hearing much, or broadly experiencing space. This is merely traveling ten thousand miles by boat and car, where the phenomena seen are narrow and vague, and what is known is either just the name or the terminology. Therefore, if you want to seek true knowledge and insight, then go back and review the old even more, to verify whether your actions are correct and whether what you know is true. Then, when you express it through brush and ink, your spirit will be concentrated, and our spirituality will also be reflected within."

### Grasping Reality
"When a person is born into the world, they may live to be a hundred years old, but the average person only lives for a few decades. Ordinary people lack the reality of artistic life, no different from the fleeting beauty of the epiphyllum flower. The expression of art lies in grasping the reality of life and beautifying it. By reflecting it in space and time, it becomes painting, sculpture, drama, music, songs, and so on. Because of this constant expression, human life gains the beauty of the artistic spirit. It excites, delights, invigorates, and moves forward endlessly. Therefore, the way of art truly has an educational function and is one of the elements of culture. Painters, like scientists, religious figures, and philosophers, based on what they feel and experience, explain the true interest of nature and life, and promote a magnified and beautified life."

### Absorbing and Creating
"Oil painting can be developed into one of our national paintings for the following reasons: First, the organization of a country can include various ethnic groups and various cultures. With today's scientific progress and material prosperity, whether it is a country, a society, or an individual, after absorbing, we should consider how to improve and create. Only in this way can we stand in the world, not be enslaved by others, and not lag behind. Today, our country only considers ink painting as national painting, which I feel is not enough. Oil painting was invented in the West and is widespread throughout the world, each becoming their national painting. We should also take advantage of the convenience of materials and use them. For example, in addition to ox carts, trains are used; in addition to oil lamps, electric lights are installed. Moreover, oil painting can express feelings to a perfect degree, so it is easy to arouse the interest of the artist and the viewer. As for the expression of meaning or thought, oil painting is even more all-encompassing."

### Guangdong Province Agricultural Science Students Guide Winter Cultivation Work
From January to the End of November

(Shaoguan Correspondent) In order to promote increased grain production in the province, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has consulted with the Ministry of Education to formulate a construction and education movement plan, ordering agricultural education institutions in all provinces to assign students to assist in agricultural construction work in each province. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has received instructions from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and has formulated detailed rules for the implementation of winter cultivation work guided by agricultural students in the province. Starting from October of this year, students from the agricultural colleges of Sun Yat-sen University and Lingnan University, as well as the provincial Meizhou Advanced Agricultural School, Maoming Advanced Agricultural School, Zhongkai School, Hepu School, Gaozhou School, Yude School, and other agricultural colleges, will be selected and assigned to various counties to guide winter cultivation promotion work nearby.

According to statistics, more than 100 students from agricultural schools throughout the province are participating in this work, which will promote winter cultivation on more than 50 acres. Assuming an average harvest of one dan of winter crops per acre, the province can increase its harvest of wheat, millet wheat, barley, rapeseed, beans, and miscellaneous grains by more than 500,000 dan this year, which will significantly benefit the food supply in Guangdong Province.

### Autumn Festival Gathering By Mo Chang
A few days ago, we had a "sun appreciation". The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon, so we inevitably have another "moon appreciation". Observing a solar eclipse is highly suitable for scientific research because it is unprecedented in three hundred years. "Moon appreciation" is the pursuit of poets. Although it happens every year, it is rare in a lifetime. Is it suitable for science? Of course, it is not contrary to logic. Don't you see the big mooncakes on the market? A large airplane is decorated on the cake, titled "Appreciating the Moon by Plane."

This kind of leisurely mood should only exist in Shanghai. People seem to be particularly forgetful and would use airplanes in this way. However, since Chang'e stole the elixir and flew to the moon, we have never forgotten the moon. Mooncakes are indispensable in stores, relying on them for a year's expenses; people never think mooncakes are too many. I waste a year or even a lifetime.

I have this mouth; I eat mooncakes; mooncakes are born for the palate, and the moonlight is provided for the eyelids. Eat and watch frantically.

Enjoying and being nervous at the same time, if this place is compared to that place, there is infinite emotion. "The moon has its phases of waxing, waning, and fullness, and people have their sorrows, joys, partings, and reunions." The Mid-Autumn Festival and the moon are not very closely related to us. The reality of sorrows, joys, partings, and reunions is what life faces. Wandering and displaced because of war, families are scattered, each in a different place, more numerous than the sands of the Ganges. Taking an airplane to the moon is truly the sweet dream of modern Emperor Tang Minghuang.

Okay, a group of people with millions of wealth naturally have a need to escape loneliness. Asking them to eat three yuan mooncakes, it is indeed demanding. But looking at the reality of sorrows, joys, partings, and reunions, please spend less, and it won't be a wrong. For yourself, and for others, you will see it clearly in the future. The whole family is in the west wind, and the September clothes have not been tailored. On a lonely island, bitter things are still indispensable. After the joy of appreciating the scenery, I wonder if there is still a trace of compassion?

The city's National Games is appealing to compatriots to actively promote the winter clothing movement. The Three Religions Daoyi Association is also asking all sectors to save autumn festival expenses to help hidden poor people and street refugees... I guess it won't all be in vain. I think.

### I am an Elastic Daughter in Life's Picture By Qiu Xia
"The city is burning with carnival fire, passion leaps on the toes... Look! Every smiling face contains sorrow, look! Every smiling face contains bitterness. Under heavy oppression, one still has to use sweet words..." This song has truly written out my life nakedly.

In the early morning, I dragged my tired body out of the man-eating maze - the dance hall. Back home, it was a gloomy and damp kitchen. At this time, my mother had quietly gotten up to prepare snacks for me. I took off my coat, cheongsam, leather shoes, and stockings, and put on a simple purple cloth shirt. After eating some porridge, I fell asleep on the bed that my mother gave up. The hard bed was certainly not as soft and comfortable as the sofa, but the air here was free. I finally fell into a deep sleep.

When I woke up, it was already 2:00 PM. I quickly got up, washed, ate, and put on makeup, which took me a full three hours. Looking at myself in the mirror, I became a heavily made-up woman again. I deeply hated this grotesque appearance, but reason told me, "For life, be patient!" So, I gently wiped away the tears from the corners of my eyes, picked up my purse, and prepared to go out. My mother said softly: "A Yuan! The landlady has been here, and the coal briquettes are also running out. Can you think of a way?" I pressed my purse, feeling sad, a burst of soreness welled up from my heart to the tip of my nose.

The melodious music resonated rhythmically. The decadent singing floated in the air. Perfume and alcohol stimulated everyone's sense of smell. Pairs of men and women spun in the dance floor, their faces close, their heads leaning on each other. One side was certainly looking for pleasure, but who knew the inner pain of the other side? I sat in a corner, worrying that the fate of eating Tangyuan yesterday would befall me again today. At the same time, my mother's pleading words when I left home trembled in my ears again.

The music started again, and a fat-headed, big-eared guy stood in front of me: the flesh on his face sneered, and his rat eyes stared intently. I remembered the touching and groping when I danced with him a few days ago, and I couldn't help but shudder. But, for the sake of life, I had to smile and greet him, embracing him and entering the dance floor. After a dance, he put a roll of paper in my hand, and besides the dance tickets, there were also five ten-yuan bills. I wanted to return them to him, but considering that his money was originally made by hoarding and manipulating and scraping the sky over our heads, I accepted it without hesitation. At least, the rent and coal briquettes were settled.

When will my father find a job, and I can jump out of this circle of life?

### Biography of Leeching Figures By Liu Tang
Five, Uncle Li
Emperor Renzong often thought of Lady Li, regretting that she did not enjoy the wealth and honor of the world, so he missed her deeply. Therefore, he treated the Li family with special kindness and married his eldest daughter (the Grand Princess of Zhou and Chen) to Wei, the son of Yonghe. Wei was simple and crude, and could not get along with the princess. The princess once knocked on the imperial city gate in the middle of the night to appeal to the emperor. Wei was demoted because of this, and they never got along well afterward. The princess often stayed in the palace, and when the princess died, Wei was demoted to Chenzhou again because he did not treat the princess well.

I have seen a case in the Bao Gong case called "Mei An," which said that Chen Shimei stopped his wife and married the princess, and was killed by Bao Zheng. According to the records, among the eighty princesses born from Emperor Taizu to Emperor Huizong, the husbands who married the princesses did not include anyone with the surname Chen. Apart from the discord between Li Wei and the Grand Princess of Chen, there were absolutely no facts similar to what is said in the novel.

The person who received the most favor from Empress Liu was Zhang Qi, because he had once lived in his house, and Qi served the empress carefully to repay her kindness. When Empress Liu was in power, she赐 him a mansion of 700 buildings, and he lived in peace and prosperity for more than forty years. He had twenty-four sons, all named with the character "yi," such as Dayi, Keyi, Liyi, and Xiyi. He built winding corridors in his house and accumulated white goods in them, trading with the maids. When a maid was sick, he personally diagnosed and treated her, and paid for the medicine. The family opened a shop, buying and selling among themselves, wanting to keep the wealth in the house and not let the profits flow out. It can be said that the exploitation was meticulous.

### Begonia By Qin Shouou
Twelve Unexpected Troubles

Before he could "but" any further, Meng's daughter-in-law could no longer bear it.

"Alright, Uncle Wu! Around here in Zhangshucun, no one knows that you are a good person. As long as you can figure out who's playing tricks on Linsheng, just say a word, and won't people follow you back?"

After she said this, Autumn Begonia could only laugh it off with Meng's shopkeeper.

The two sides talked a lot afterward, but Meng's shopkeeper always used soft tactics. Even when Autumn Begonia wanted to take out fifty yuan to give him as travel expenses for Mei Bao to return home, he stubbornly refused to accept it. He kept saying:

"This is all Shang Laoer's fault, how can I let you spend money."

In a state of excessive excitement, Autumn Begonia struggled to climb down from the bed and personally sent Meng's in-laws out.

"Now it's all good!" Zhang Laoer helped Autumn Begonia close the door, almost clapping his hands and laughing. "Zhao Erye's plan is really admirable! If we hadn't snatched their Linsheng as a pledge, how could our daughter come back?" (227) (End of Chapter Twelve)

### Arts and Entertainment World After Watching Zhang Wenjuan's Play
The day before yesterday, Zhang Wenjuan performed several plays, "Sang Yuan Hui" and "Er Jin Gong," at the Golden Theater. Before that, Yan Shishan and Xiao San Mazi performed "Cui Ping Shan." There was also "Qiao Lian Huan," Ai Shiju stealing chickens as Shi Qian. I was invited by a friend to watch. I don't often see Xiao San Mazi's plays, so I went early. Xiao San Mazi played Shi Xiu, and his appearance was very heroic, making one feel a murderous aura, very much like a hero from the Water Margin. After the quarrel was over, he asked the bartender to borrow a knife, and after getting drunk, he asked for the knife again. Liu Binkun's performance as the monk Hai was also very good. When Shi Xiu was about to kill Pan Qiaoyun at Cui Ping Shan, Yan Shishan's performance and tumbling skills were excellent. Miao Shengchun's Yang Xiong was too comical. Everyone sang in the Bangzi opera style, and the rapid strings made the drama particularly tense. It has been many years since I heard Bangzi opera. Now, hearing it by chance, I feel refreshed. Xiao San Mazi, originally Wang Hongshou (Lao San Mazi), is from the Guan Gong opera school and is good at plays like "Sweeping the Pine" and "Running the City." Now, playing Shi Xiu, he is completely a martial arts role, which is a different skill. Looking at his gestures and expressions, and the singing of the Bangzi opera, it is surprisingly good. It can be seen that he is versatile.

"Shi Qian Stealing Chickens," also known as "Qiao Lian Huan," was previously headlined by Ye Shengzhang. He often used this play to make money. I have never seen Ai Shiju perform this play before. Ai Shiju's steps are light, his speech is clear, and his martial arts are not bad, not inferior to Ye Shengzhang. When eating chicken, he uses burning paper to replace chicken meat and puts it in his mouth (eating fire is a small trick. People haven't eaten it before, so they treat it as novel, but it's nothing. I played the trick of eating fire in private school when I was a child, so I know.)

Zhang Wenjuan sang "Sang Yuan Hui" in a low key, probably saving her energy to sing "Er Jin Gong." On the other hand, Ma Yanfen sang and acted sincerely, with every stroke meticulously done. Gu Shaoquan's Qiu Mu sang in a low key and couldn't sing well. After "Sang Yuan Hui" finished, there was less than ten minutes of rest. "Er Jin Gong" began, and Ma Yanfen played Empress Li on stage. The new tune of the Erhuang Manban was written by a Qingyi amateur. The rhyme was still "you qiu" unchanged. The words were different from the ordinary ones. There was a good sentence: "He treats me as a widow and orphans as cattle and horses," but the old words had "Before I knew it, I had come to the Mid-Autumn Festival," which pointed out the season. This is the most important sentence in the play. Probably singing new words is for the convenience of arranging new tunes. However, my ears are old, and I always like to listen to old tunes. Let's not talk about this, just say that Zhang Wenjuan, who played Yang Bo, sang the "Your Majesty" section. Wenjuan's voice was very good at this time. The first four sentences were sung well. I don't know what happened, but after the fourth sentence, she began to sing "In the ninth month, on the thirteenth, the snow and frost fall, the world's loyal people cannot live long." I thought maybe she was singing another kind of lyric. Who knew that after these two sentences, she turned back and sang "The courtiers have set up a trap,..."

### Adoption of a Single Shift Work Schedule: British Businesses Convene to Consider; Banks May Face Obstacles; Municipal Council Unlikely to Adopt

The English-language "China Press" reports that, according to inquiries made today (the 2nd) from various sources, the majority of American and British businesses in Shanghai are expected to adopt a single shift work schedule this winter to conserve coal consumption in the area. The American Chamber of Commerce has already approved this new change in work hours, and the British Chamber of Commerce and the Overseas Chinese Association are following suit, holding a meeting yesterday, the 2nd, at 5:00 PM, to

Consider the matter.

The discussion's outcome will significantly impact the change in work hours and may lead some hesitant businesses to decide to switch to a single-shift schedule. The reporter asked Mr. Hawkins, Manager of the Shanghai Mercantile Bank and Chairman of the Foreign Banks' Association, about the foreign banks' stance. He replied that no decision has been made yet, but he believes that this change will not make much difference because the banks' business

Is not busy.

Another British banker stated that if banks change their business hours, customers will not be able to present checks for cash in the afternoon, which is quite inconvenient. Many banks here have business dealings with branches worldwide, receiving telegrams at any time, which must be maintained. Therefore, changes in business hours will affect the handling of business. A spokesperson for the Municipal Council stated this morning that the council has not yet studied the single-shift work schedule and that the important departments of the council are unlikely to adopt this method.

### First-Class Cabin Fares of Two Shipping Companies Increased by 10%

The passenger fares of the North and South China Sea routes of the British Jardine Matheson and Swire shipping companies have been repeatedly increased, as reported in the newspapers. At the beginning of last month, ship ticket prices increased again, but first-class fares were not increased. It is now learned that the two companies have again agreed to increase first-class fares by 10%, effective from the previous day (the 1st). The fares are calculated in Hong Kong dollars, and first-class is divided into three classes: A, B, and economy class. The details are listed below:

North China Route

Shanghai to Qingdao: A class 40 yuan, B class 35 yuan, economy 30 yuan; to Weihaiwei: A class 60 yuan, B class 55 yuan, economy 45 yuan; the fares to Yantai are the same as Weihaiwei; to Tianjin: A class 75 yuan, B class 70 yuan, economy 60 yuan.

South China Route

Shanghai to Fuzhou: A class 95 yuan, B class 85 yuan, economy 75 yuan; to Xiamen: A class 95 yuan, B class 85 yuan, economy 75 yuan; to Shantou: A class 105 yuan, B class 95 yuan, economy 85 yuan; to Hong Kong: A class 110 yuan, B class 100 yuan, economy 90 yuan; to Guangzhou: A class 125 yuan, B class 115 yuan, economy 105 yuan. All are calculated in Hong Kong dollars. As for Fuzhou and Guangzhou, although fares have been set, there are no ships sailing there yet.

### Animal Protection Society Purchases Flags for Fundraising to Protect Animals

The Shanghai Animal Protection Society's "Blue Cross Quarterly" states that the society has obtained permission from the authorities of both concessions to hold a flag sale on October 18th to raise funds to support the society's expenses. They hope for assistance from all sectors of society. The "Blue Cross Quarterly" contains the diary of an animal protection society inspector, describing his investigations of animal cruelty and inspections of slaughterhouses, dark shops, and stables. In June and July, the society retrieved nine dogs and one cat, returning them to their original owners. Twenty-nine dogs, twenty-four cats, and eight rabbits were given to people for adoption. Thirty-three dogs and one hundred and nineteen cats were humanely euthanized by the authorities.

### Relief Film Shown in the United States

In order to promote sympathy for China among the American people, the Northern Baptist Convention has transported a film depicting wartime relief for Chinese refugees to various locations in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, and other cities for continuous screenings, inviting the American people to attend. The number of attendees is quite crowded. Screenings are also held in various schools during the week, exclusively for students to watch, with significant positive effects.

### Impressions of a Japanese-Manchukuo Railway Director After Visiting the United States

The English-language "China Press" reports that the Japanese-language "Continental News" stated today (the 2nd) that among the passengers on the American President Lines' "President Tyler" ship, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 1st), were thirty-eight Japanese people who had withdrawn from Europe and the United States. Mr. Nakanishi, a director of the South Manchuria Railway, was also among them. He told Japanese reporters that he had traveled from Lisbon to the United States, staying for several days, and returned east by ship. His impression was that the United States is now vastly different from what it was before, and it has become a major power. Therefore, the Japanese must change their view of the United States. In the past, the United States followed the lead of public sentiment in governing, but now the government leads the people. Currently, some Japanese expatriates have had to abandon their businesses, which they have been developing for many years, and are hurrying back to their home country, which is quite regrettable.

### Zhang Ruogu Still Detained by the Police

Mr. Zhang Ruogu, an editor at the American-owned "China-America Daily News," was arrested on the 24th of last month in the French Concession by Japanese military police together with French police officers. Yesterday, after inquiry, Dr. Denny, an Italian lawyer hired by Mr. Zhang's relatives, asked what crimes Mr. Zhang had committed and what laws he had violated that led to his arrest. The result of the inquiry was that the police were free to deal with the case or release him. Mr. Zhang was still taken back to the police station for temporary detention. Currently, Dr. Denny is continuing to negotiate with the police, arguing that Mr. Zhang's arrest has no legal basis and no charges have been filed. He is asking the police to uphold justice, protect human rights, and release him immediately to appease public expectations. At the same time, the "China-America Daily News" has also appealed to French Ambassador Cosme to uphold justice and humanity and immediately translate the case of Mr. Zhang Ruogu.

### "President Tyler" Sailed South Last Night

The American President Lines' global mail ship "President Tyler" arrived in Shanghai on the 10th and docked at berths 12 and 13. Among the passengers was a woman, said to be Mrs. White, wife of a lawyer for the Shanghai Municipal Council. She is the first American to be granted a passport and allowed to come to Shanghai. At 6:30 PM yesterday, the ship left Shanghai for Hong Kong, Luzon, and Singapore. It is said that about one hundred passengers were brought from the United States, and about eighty of them were traveling to Southeast Asia on the same ship. More than seventy people from this city also took the ship to Southeast Asia. The ship will not go to India and return to China via another route after reaching Singapore. It will still have to return to Shanghai and then back to the United States, arriving in Shanghai around the end of this month.

### Thai Ship Detained, Forced to Unload Cargo

At the request of the Japanese military police, the Shanghai Customs authorities are still detaining the Thai ship "Suriya Thai Nawa" today (the 2nd). It is said that about 2,000 tons of cotton and cloth carried by the ship must be unloaded, as the Japanese side claims that these goods are intended to be transported to the wartime capital to manufacture military uniforms. According to a statement from the Japanese military this morning, the Thai ship will continue to be detained until all the goods have been unloaded and handed over to the Japanese authorities for safekeeping. It is expected that these goods will be unloaded soon, so the Thai ship may be allowed to leave in a few days. At the same time, the Japanese side recently announced that the British ship "Kinai Maru" was previously found by the Japanese to be carrying a large amount of goods intended to be transferred to the wartime capital, leading to its detention. Now, all the goods have been confiscated, and the ship sailed to Hong Kong last Saturday.

### French Concession Clock Not Set Back; Daylight Saving Time Abolished; Announcement Awaits Agreement Between Two Concessions

To the Editor: I was surprised to read in today's local news section of your esteemed newspaper the statement that "the French Concession Municipal Council announced that it will restore the old time from today, setting the clock back one hour last night." The clock change that the bureau made from today is for the office hours of the bureau's organs (except for Saturday afternoons, from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM, and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day), and not to change the summer time. If it is determined to officially restore the old time, it will be announced separately before being implemented simultaneously with the Public Concession authorities. I am sending this letter specifically, hoping that your esteemed publication will pay attention to it and promptly correct it to avoid confusion and misunderstanding. I am greatly indebted to you. Sincerely, the General Secretariat of the French Municipal Council. October 1, 1941. According to the Municipal Council Information Office, the Bureau currently has no decision on the daylight saving time. As soon as the Board of Directors decides, it will be announced. As for the office hours of this bureau, they have been changed to 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM from yesterday (the 1st), as usual.

### Authorities Intend to Levy Additional Taxes on Exchange Buildings; Business Special Tax Decided to Be Levied Next Year; 8% Levied on All Valuations

According to the Municipal Council, the case of the special tax on business premises that the Bureau intends to levy has been submitted to the Special Advisory Committee for deliberation at two meetings. As a result, the committee approved the case in principle, but advocated that the basic rate of the special tax should be 8% and that the establishment of Category B in the original plan should be cancelled. The securities, gold, and commodity exchange buildings listed in Category B should be merged into Category A to levy the special tax.

This approach

Will only reduce the Bureau's revenue by about 13,000 yuan. The majority of the committee members believe that instead of establishing a separate category for each exchange building and levying a special tax, it is better to collect "taxes" from them in other ways. As for the establishment of Category B, it may be implemented later, and it will be easier to fairly determine which

Special business

Should be included in this category when the "New Tax Source Committee" can suggest other taxes. At the regular meeting held by the Bureau on the 1st of this month, it was resolved to accept the committee's opinion and temporarily abolish Category B. All types of buildings that should be subject to special taxes will be levied at a basic tax rate of 8%. Therefore, the Bureau decided to levy a special tax of 8% per year on all types of buildings used for profit-making businesses, including offices, shops, factories, warehouses, and docks, based on their valuation, from January 1st next year. Also,

Cigarette license

The tax has been decided to be postponed for classification. After investigating the business conditions of each cigarette paper shop, the classification method will be considered. It is reported that the Finance Committee is continuing its investigation, and no decision can be made for the time being.

### Court Full Judgement in Passenger Pushed to Death by Ticket Seller: Death by Pushing Firmly Established; Defendant's Brutal Nature Irreconcilable

Wang Wanxiang from Hai, ticket seller No. 358 of the British Electric Tramway Company, pushed passenger Xiang Dongchuan off the trolleybus on Route 20 on September 13 because he failed to extort money, resulting in Xiang's death. After the arrest, the police attorney Zhang Tianyin prosecuted Wang for intentional injury causing death, requesting the maximum penalty. After this case occurred, the usual attitude of the ticket sellers and their various extortion attempts had left passengers with a deep negative impression. This time, the ticket seller dared to push a passenger to death because he failed to extort money, causing public outrage. After trial judge Shi Meiyu clarified the matter, Wang Wanxiang was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for life. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, Judge Shi has prepared the judgment and delivered it separately yesterday. The main points of the judgment and the reasons for the judgment listed in the judgment are excerpted below.

(Judgment) Wang Wanxiang is sentenced to life imprisonment for intentional injury causing death, and is deprived of his civil rights for life (details omitted).

(Reasons) It has been found that the deceased Xiang Dongchuan had purplish blue and swollen veins, bleeding from the nose and mouth, a superficial abrasion on his left shoulder, and a deep red spot on the back of his head, about the size of a silver dollar. He was injured and died before his death. It has been verified by the prosecutor of this court together with the forensic doctor and a forensic report has been filled out and filed. When questioned, the defendant Wang Wanxiang claimed that the deceased jumped off the bus himself and denied that he had pushed him. It has been verified that the defendant had a dispute with Xiang Dongchuan over

Embezzling bus fare,

And how he became enraged and forcefully pushed Xiang Dongchuan out of the bus, causing him to fall and die. The witnesses Jiang Jing and Xu Shenjin, who witnessed the incident on the scene, have given sworn testimony. After separate questioning by this court, their testimonies were consistent and without any flaws. The said tax decision was suspended, etc., all being young students, and they had no prior grudge against the defendant Wang Wanxiang. Based on their direct observations, they stated the facts truthfully, and what they stated was

Consistent with the facts.

It is sufficient to be adopted as conclusive evidence. Also, according to witness Xu Shenjin, he and the deceased were standing at the door of the car at the time, facing inward and with their backs to the outside. When the deceased was pushed, he reached out and grabbed Xu's left arm, causing him to fall out of the car as well. Furthermore, the forensic report issued by the Procuratorate stated that the deceased's fatal injury was in the head, which shows that Xiang Dongchuan was pushed down facing upwards. The defense that he jumped off the bus himself and died is untenable. As for the witness Yan Defa,

He was not present at the scene

At the time of the incident. He suddenly appeared in court during the trial and made unsubstantiated statements, attacking Jiang Jing's testimony. His testimony is not sufficient to prove the defendant's innocence. According to the witness, Jiang Jing rang the bell twice, and Xiang Dongchuan fell down. This also contradicts Wang Wanxiang's argument that Dongchuan pressed the bell himself and jumped off the bus. His false statement has been exposed. Based on the above analysis, it is

Firmly established

That Xiang Dongchuan was pushed off the tram by Wang Wanxiang before his death, fell and injured the back of his head, and died. Although there is no sufficient evidence to prove that he had the intention to kill, he cannot escape the responsibility for the crime of injuring a person resulting in death. The defendant is brutal in nature and pushed a passenger to death because he failed to embezzle bus fare. Not only the deceased and his family suffered harm, but also the general public felt a considerable danger. Furthermore, the defendant was evasive after the case was solved and had no remorse. Considering his motive, method, and the resulting harm, danger, and attitude after the crime, it is truly

Irreconcilable.

It is not enough to give him a full and severe punishment to serve as a warning. In accordance with Articles 291 and 292 of the Criminal Procedure Law and Article 177, paragraph 2, Article 57 and 37 of the Criminal Law, paragraph 1, the judgment is as stated in the main text. September 26, 30th year of the Republic of China. Judge You Meiyu.

### Kidnapping Incident Occurs on the Bund, Amidst the Noise of Traffic; British Merchant Ha Hui Shipyard Comprador Zhuang Zhicheng Abducted While Crossing the River

The trend of kidnapping has become rampant again. Yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, another kidnapping incident occurred near the Jianghai Customs Wharf on the Bund, amidst the noise of traffic. The victim was Zhuang Zhicheng, a comprador for the British Ha Hui Shipyard in Ningbo Fenghua. Zhuang is 47 years old, married to Qian, and has five sons and six daughters. Recently, Zhuang moved his family to Pudong to facilitate his work. Yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, Zhuang, dressed in a Western suit, went to Pudong from the shipyard's general office at No. 320 Sichuan Road, Puxi. He took the factory's small steamboat Anatai from the Customs Wharf to cross the river. Unexpectedly, four kidnappers were lying in ambush on the wharf. Two kidnappers held pistols and rushed forward, grabbing Zhuang and forcing him into a bandit car No. 3669 parked on the side of the road, and drove away quickly, disappearing without a trace. After the police inquired, a case was filed and detectives were sent to investigate the scene and ordered a thorough investigation.

### Accountant of Xingchang Rice Shop Shot Dead

At 9:15 PM last night, at No. 485, the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Datong Road in the Public Concession, while the Xingchang Rice Shop was closing, a robber broke in, pulled out a Mauser pistol, and threatened them not to make a sound. At that time, all the legal tender in the shop had been put into the safe. The robber forced Zhang Ziliang, the accountant of the shop, to hand over the key, but Zhang Ziliang firmly refused and shouted for help, which angered the robber, who shot him. Zhang was shot four times, one each in the back of the head, top of the head, left chest, and back. Because the injuries were in vital parts of the body, he immediately fell to the ground and died. The robber, seeing that he had caused trouble, fled without robbing anything. Afterwards, the police called an ambulance to send Zhang Ziliang to Baolong Hospital and then to the morgue for autopsy.
