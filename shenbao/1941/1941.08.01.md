### Brief News Hong Kong: Sun Ke and Ye Gongchuo discuss drawing a portrait of the National Father, decide to allocate funds from the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center, and hire Lu Shihou as a full-time painter. (30th Dispatch) Foreign Minister Guo delivers a speech at the Sino-British Cultural Association. Chongqing: Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi delivered a speech at the Sino-British Cultural Association last night, stating that the solid friendship and cultural understanding between China and Britain will not only guarantee close cooperation between the two countries in the current world crisis, but will also occupy an important position in post-war reconstruction. The Chinese government and the public are very grateful for the economic measures taken by the British Empire to deal with Japan. He believes that Japan is the weakest link in the Axis powers, and closer cooperation between the United States, Britain, and China in the Pacific can first defeat Japan, setting an example for other Axis countries. The subsequent worldwide political, military, and spiritual repercussions will be very important and beneficial. Guo also mentioned that before departing from London, Mr. Butler, the former British Foreign Secretary who has now been promoted to Minister of Education, sent a letter urging him to continue to promote Sino-British cultural relations after returning to Chongqing. He believes that the Chinese Art Exhibition in London has contributed more to promoting the British public's closer understanding of China than any other event. (31st Reuters Dispatch)

Editorial: From Blitz to Stalemate When the Soviet-German war broke out, the German military estimated that they would break through the Soviet defense line within three weeks and end the war against the Soviet Union in six weeks. It is unclear whether this assessment was based purely on military considerations or whether it also took into account the already dampening peace offensive against Britain and the possible political struggles within the Soviet Union. However, in reality, the period that the Germans expected to end the war has now arrived, but the German army is still being blocked on the outskirts of Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv. There has been no significant progress or retreat in the past few days. The front line is gradually becoming deadlocked, and the hope of Nazi victory is extremely slim. Unfavorable factors are increasing without end. Since Hitler seized power, this is considered the most serious blow. The era of raising an arm and causing the world to yield has become a thing of the past! Reviewing the past battles, the number of troops mobilized by the Germans and the intensity of the offensive this time have exceeded last year's Western Front campaign. However, the "infiltration tactics" that achieved great success in the past, such as extended encirclement and paratrooper landings, have not been effective this time. Due to the different national conditions of the Soviet Union and the unique performance of Stalin's defense line, a full-line war spanning 2,000 miles formed at the beginning of the war, forcing Germany to disperse its forces across the entire front line from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea. Furthermore, due to the depth deployment of the Soviet army's defense line and its strengths in guerrilla warfare, even if the German army could penetrate deep into Smolensk, Zhytomyr, and the northeast, southwest, and other directions of Leningrad, the three major targets of Moscow, Kyiv, and Leningrad remained out of reach. At the beginning of the war, the focus of the German offensive was clearly on capturing these three major cities, but this attempt soon vanished. Among the three routes, the German army penetrated farthest on the central route. Smolensk happened to be halfway between the old Soviet border and Moscow. The most difficult for the Soviet defense was the northern route, with the German army advancing from Estonia and the north and south banks of Lake Ladoga in three routes. Kyiv, the closest to the front line, is only a few dozen miles from Zhytomyr. However, this seems to be the peak of the German advance, and there is no sign of any significant progress in any aspect. Looking at the course of the war, the German offensive was strongest and progressed fastest in the first two weeks of the war. However, after reaching the old Soviet border, the progress suddenly slowed down, and the first step of the blitzkrieg came to a halt. By mid-July, the Germans adjusted and reinforced again, and continued to attack fiercely, reaching Smolensk and Zhytomyr on the central and southern routes, respectively, at the beginning of the fifth week. The northern route also tried its best to advance from the Karelian Isthmus, attempting to encircle Leningrad. However, under the strong counterattack of the Soviet army, the battle situation quickly stabilized, forming a stalemate. On the central route, although the German army had penetrated deep into Smolensk, Pruzhany, Nevel, and Bobruisk, which were on the left and right wings of the German breakthrough point, were still firmly held by the Soviet army, constantly threatening the rear of the penetrating German army. The German war report recently explained the slow progress in the central area, stating that a large number of Soviet troops remained in the rear. Regardless of whether this is a cover-up or an excuse, it is sufficient to show that the German Panzer troops and their strategies, which are known for their speed, have been unable to maintain their winning record in this battle. Regardless of the Soviet Union's determination and confidence in defending the three major cities such as Moscow, even if the German army could capture one or two of them by chance, it would have no decisive effect on the overall situation of the war, and the price paid by the Germans would certainly be greater than the losses of the past six weeks. Because the current war against the Soviet Union has deeply exposed the German side's miscalculations in both military and political aspects, it is not difficult to imagine the current distress and anxiety of the Nazi authorities. Looking at the German war reports, their inconsistencies, contradictions, and exaggerated defeats are too numerous to count. Although the messages issued by the Soviet side occasionally contain some bizarre propaganda, their war communiques are far more accurate and reliable than those of the German side. From this point of view, the calmness and panic of the two sides are clearly different. After suffering this setback, it is a major mystery whether Hitler will concentrate all his forces to try again against the Soviet Union, or change his strategy and find another way. It is rumored that he will advance to threaten Spain and Portugal, occupy Dakar, and then spy on the Americas, or that he will station a large army on the border of Bulgaria, preparing to invade Turkey. British Prime Minister Churchill even warned the British people on the 29th that the season for the German invasion of Britain has arrived. However, these rumors have not yet been confirmed. According to normal theory, after Hitler's failure to attack the Soviet Union, he may not refrain from seeking achievements in other areas to restore his lost prestige. However, the war against the Soviet Union will ultimately be unresolved, and the losses and failures it has caused cannot be compensated by any other easy achievements. The more favorable way out is to launch another peace offensive against Britain, undermining the cooperation between the Soviet Union and democratic countries, while quickly attacking the Soviet Union with all its strength. In addition, he could incite his Far Eastern allies to attack the Soviet Union, containing Britain and the United States. However, Britain has already warned against the peace offensive and reiterated its determination not to negotiate with the Nazis. After the Soviet Union has stabilized in the first phase of the war, it should be more confident in coping. If the Nazis suffer another defeat, it will inevitably lead to a repeat of Napoleon's debacle. As for the Far East, it is more subtle and complex than Europe. However, even the powerful and invincible Nazis are gradually entering a state of decline. Compared to Germany, the aggressors whose strength and resources are beyond reach will inevitably not escape the judgment of history and justice. Rumor: Japan uses Vietnamese territory as bait to induce Thailand to accept Japanese conditions, transfers exclusive rights to tin and rubber, and allows Japan to use naval and air bases. Reuters, Bangkok, 31st â€“ Responsible parties have denied reports that Japan has proposed to Thailand that if Thailand joins Japan's so-called new order, Japan will reward it with Dongpu and Laos. However, informed sources here believe that Japan will definitely use some kind of proposal to probe Thailand, and it is only a matter of time. According to their opinion, Japan may soon offer Thailand the world-famous Laos province of Burma and Vietnam. It is believed that for emotional and political reasons, Thailand will definitely accept this offer. However, this offer is subject to two important conditions: (1) Japan has de facto exclusive rights to the export of Thai rice, tin, and rubber; (2) Thailand allows Japan the convenience of temporarily using Thai naval and air bases. Thailand's attitude depends on the attitude of the United States and Britain, but whether Thailand will give serious consideration to this conditional offer is another question. Although Japanese troops are approaching Thailand's eastern border, Japan knows that Vichy's concessions may not be seen again in Bangkok. The Thai authorities are now closely watching various developments in the tense situation in the Far East and the reactions of Britain and the United States to these developments. It is clear that if Thailand grants Japan exclusive rights to export tin and rubber, the United States and Britain will actively assist Thailand in opposing Japan's blockade. If Thailand allows Japan to use its naval and air bases, the United States and Britain will definitely consider Thailand to have abandoned its neutrality. Even if Thailand is prepared to discuss a revised form of the first condition, it cannot easily accept the restrictions of the second condition. It is expected that Japan may immediately demand that Thailand recognize Manchukuo and the Nanjing government, using this as a tool to test the extent to which Thailand relies on foreign support to resist Japanese pressure. After rumors of Japanese pressure on Thailand arose, this agency issued a public statement reaffirming Thailand's foreign policy, clarifying that Thailand has not encountered any economic or military pressure and does not fear that any foreign country will target Thailand for aggression. Thailand does not participate in any disputes outside its borders, but hopes to conduct foreign trade relations in order to maintain friendly relations with all countries. United Press, Tokyo, 31st â€“ "Japan Known Times" declared today that as a result of the principles established by the Franco-Vietnamese joint defense agreement, "the Dutch East Indies now has a special opportunity to reconsider its position and pave the way for concluding an agreement with Japan." The newspaper hopes that "the current stability in Vietnam will be extended to Thailand," and asks the Thai Prime Minister to take steps to overcome the country's hostile elements. "Japan Known Times" stated that the Franco-Japanese joint defense agreement proves "a new type of diplomacy that transcends the one-sided system that previously emerged in Far Eastern diplomatic activities," and said that Japanese diplomacy guarantees the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the joint defense countries. The newspaper called the United States' occupation of Iceland "an invasion of a distant place with which the United States has no economic or defense ties," and compared this with the "peaceful" occupation of Vietnam. The U.S. still hopes that Japan will change its course and cooperate with the U.S. The U.S., Britain, the Netherlands, and India may issue notes transporting large quantities of oil to Japan. United Press, Washington, 31st â€“ The U.S. government has taken strict measures against Japan and is prepared to take even sharper actions. However, officials here yesterday still expressed hope that Japan could reformulate its policies and cooperate with the United States. This obvious fact can be seen from President Roosevelt's refusal to explicitly state whether he would impose an oil embargo on Japan, and from Deputy Secretary of State Welles' statement that the United States will now clear Japanese ships within U.S. waters. Other responsible parties stated that the U.S. government would definitely welcome Japan's cooperation and expressed the opinion that it is not too late to avoid a tragic conflict. Tokyo only needs to adopt a cooperative attitude and engage in in-depth and detailed cooperation with the U.S. military. These officials recalled that Japan once adopted this policy, gradually emerging in the world from 1911 until it recently abolished the Washington Naval Treaty. Japan's world status has deteriorated since it abandoned this policy and launched aggression against neighboring countries. Today, although Japan is close to the Axis powers, the land of the Sun Empire is almost isolated from the world. The reason why Japan is in isolation is probably because the Axis countries cannot geographically assist Japan. However, the naval power of the United States and Britain can cooperate when Japan is willing. The authorities said that they currently do not hope that Japan will abandon the Axis powers, but believe that this is the most intelligent path for Japan. They also pointed out that the Axis powers are currently encountering increasingly difficult difficulties in the Soviet Union, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic, so it is widely believed that powerful leaders in Japan are considering Japan's return to traditional policies to cooperate with the world's naval powers. United Press, London, 31st â€“ The latest news obtained here yesterday confirms that the United States and the Dutch East Indies may issue notes transporting large quantities of oil to Japan. The chaotic situation of economic sanctions against Japan by democratic countries has become clearer. Because of various indications, the United States and the Dutch East Indies may continue to transport large quantities of cotton yarn to Japan. The details of the U.S. sanctions are not yet clear. However, the general opinion is that freezing funds has left some major loopholes in the form of lenient issuance of notes for various goods. Because the United States lacks ordinary exchange controls, it is widely believed that the strict implementation of the embargo will fail. It seems very clear that the U.S. government will control imports from Japan subject to notes. Orders in Japan before July 26 will be exempt from note transportation. However, it is widely believed that all imports after this will be controlled by the U.S. government. It has recently been heard that exchange transactions between the U.S. and Japan have been suspended, except for a small amount of funds. Observers believe that the strictness and leniency of the U.S. government's handling of sanctions against Japan will be the determining factor for the British Empire and the Netherlands. Imports of cotton textiles from Japan by the British Empire will be subject to note control. The British Empire's supply of raw materials to Japan, mainly cotton yarn and oil, will be reduced exceptionally. However, whether Japan can obtain a large amount of this depends on the actions of the United States. Observers declared that the possible leniency in the U.S.'s implementation of sanctions will inevitably prompt the Dutch East Indies to lower its strict measures. If the U.S. allows oil and cotton to continue to be transported to Japan, it is believed that the Dutch East Indies will inevitably sell oil, rubber, tin, and other products in the same way. Konoe urges the whole country to respond to the crisis. The Deputy Director-General of the Planning Board says Japan is planning to respond to the British and American alliance. Reuters, Tokyo, 31st â€“ At the 16th Plenary Session of the National Mobilization Survey Committee, Prime Minister Konoe stated that the current war has undoubtedly had a serious impact on Japan, and it is difficult to predict where the European conflict will spread. In view of the rapid changes in the world situation, everyone in Japan must be prepared to cope with a difficult situation. The Japanese government is doing everything within its power to mobilize all the nation's material and human resources to cope with any situation that may arise in the future. Reuters, Tokyo, 31st â€“ The semi-official newspaper "Japan Times" published an article by Takehiko Miyamoto, Deputy Director-General of the Planning Board, stating that the Japanese government is fully prepared to respond to any situation arising from the British and American alliance in the Far East. All aspects of economic warfare have been considered. Japan has arranged its economy for the second half of this year without relying on supplies from Britain and the United States. The supply of materials is based on self-sufficiency resulting from the combination of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, supplemented by the visible directories obtained from the southern countries. However, although Japan is fully prepared to cope with the situation, there is no doubt about the seriousness of the situation and the importance of developing Japan's combat capabilities based on emergency measures. The U.S. Department of War requests to build bases on the Philippines to make it the Gibraltar of the East. The Japanese army has a total of 66 divisions. International News Agency, Washington, 31st â€“ The Department of War will submit a bill yesterday requesting an allocation of $53,000,000 to make the Philippines the "Gibraltar of the East" and serve as the main naval base for the U.S. Navy in the East. The newly appointed commander of the Philippine Army, General MacArthur, submitted this funding request as early as 1934, when he was ordered to build Philippine defenses and the army. Military sources said that if Japan attempts to occupy the Philippines, it will send a large number of Japanese naval and army forces to carry out a large-scale attack. However, they pointed out that Japan must conscript Philippine soldiers before attacking the Dutch East Indies. The same source also said that Japan is reportedly satisfied with its occupation of Vietnam and does not intend to take any further military risks immediately. It is claimed that Japan has a total of 57 divisions in peacetime, of which 30 divisions are stationed in China and must remain there, 10 divisions are stationed in Manchuria, 2 divisions are stationed in Korea, 1 division is stationed in Sakhalin Island, 4 or 5 divisions are stationed in Japan, and 3 or 4 divisions are stationed in Hainan Island. In addition, there are those who have been sent to Vietnam. Washington has received reports that Japan has added 300,000 people in the past ten days. The total number of troops in the army now totals 66 divisions, or 1.8 million people, reaching saturation point. As for the Japanese Air Force, it has a total of 2,600 aircraft, most of which are 1939 models, distributed in the army and the navy. However, the Japanese army has no armored divisions and cannot carry out modern blitzkriegs. If the Russian army in Siberia has 26 infantry divisions and 2,000 aircraft to fight, Japan must have 23 divisions for offensive use. Craigie and Toyoda talk about British-Japanese relations. Reuters, Tokyo â€“ Closure event â€“ British Member of Parliament raises discussion. Reuters, Tokyo, 30th â€“ Official news, British Ambassador to Japan Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Toyoda yesterday afternoon for more than half an hour, reportedly discussing the latest developments in British-Japanese relations. Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 31st â€“ British Foreign Secretary Eden issued a statement in the House of Commons yesterday regarding British-Japanese relations, stating that the measures announced by Britain against Japan are the result of urging those responsible for Japan's destiny to reconsider its policies to avoid regret. Reuters, London, 31st â€“ In the House of Commons yesterday, Member of Parliament Milner asked the Foreign Secretary whether the Japanese authorities instigated the forced closure of Reuters and Chu Bao, the only British news agency in Hankou, and said that as a result, the vast area of Central China would henceforth rely entirely on news provided by the Axis countries. Eden replied that he had instructed local British officials to prepare a report, which had not yet been received. Milner also asked whether the Foreign Secretary would carefully consider whether any measures could be taken to prevent the cessation of British news in China. Eden replied that he thought so, and had instructed them to prepare a report in order to decide what steps could be taken. The U.S. detains Japanese fishing boats. United Press, Washington, 31st â€“ U.S. Treasury Department official Ira yesterday declared that the recent detention of 19 Japanese fishing boats in Hawaiian waters was a very important case. Although many Treasury Department officials refused to comment on reports from other government officials that the detention of Japanese fishing boats was a cleansing of espionage activities in Hawaii, informed sources said that the crew members of the detained fishing boats included several Japanese naval officers. 100,000 Japanese troops transferred to the Northeast, preparing for war against the Soviet Union. United Press, Chongqing, 31st â€“ Official Central News Agency said that 100,000 Japanese troops have been transferred from the Japanese mainland to the Northeast for possible or potential war against the Soviet Union. The Nazi Party's newspaper "Danube" yesterday predicted that the European war would expand to the Far East, and said that Japan would soon go to war against the Soviet Union. The U.S. President asks Congress to authorize price controls, because rising prices endanger national defense efforts. Reuters, Washington, 31st â€“ President Roosevelt sent a message to Congress yesterday, stating that inflationary price increases are now endangering the U.S.'s national defense efforts. He asked Congress to immediately authorize him to set maximum prices and rents, and asked Congress to allow him to purchase raw materials and goods when necessary to ensure price stability. Although the President did not request the power to limit wages, he claimed that he hoped for the voluntary cooperation of labor to avoid sudden increases in labor costs, and said that price stability is more beneficial to labor than wage increases, because wage increases are nominal and will be caught up by the rise in the cost of living, causing labor to suffer. The President mentioned rents, saying that there is a current trend of rent increases similar to that during the last World War. This development must be stopped to avoid increasing the cost of living and disrupting public morals. It is expected that the two houses will soon pass a bill in accordance with the President's request. However, opinions among those in Congress differ on the issue of price limits. Several senators have already declared their opposition to restrictions on agricultural products. The Senate yesterday passed a bill to prohibit the sale of state-owned cotton during the national emergency. Some members advocated managing wages, because the increase in wages increases manufacturing costs, ultimately leading to market price increases. The President also said that the U.S. government is currently spending 30 million yuan on national defense every day, and this still needs to be increased. Reuters, Washington, 31st â€“ U.S. officials have issued a license allowing the Japanese ship "Tatsuta Maru" to withdraw the funds needed to pay for fuel for its return to Japan. However, the Japanese shipping company to which the ship belongs has received notice that the large amount of raw silk carried by the ship is not allowed to be landed. The ship has now obtained special permission to unload passengers. The U.S.'s refusal to allow the ship's cargo to land this time is the first action by the government's Frozen Assets Management Committee to interpret its policy. The Tatsuta Maru is scheduled to depart for its return to Japan tomorrow morning. United Press, Washington, 31st â€“ Defense officials yesterday predicted that the steel industry will be placed under strict control in the next few days in order to avoid shortages of raw materials that would hinder the national defense program. However, defense officials refused to state whether steel factories would be subject to government orders, only stating that the government must ensure that steel is used for national defense. Informed sources said that the new control measures will be implemented from August 1.

Washington Officially Announces Acceleration of Military Supplies to the Soviet Union Hopkins and Stalin Hold Talks to Discuss Methods of Assisting the Soviet Union in Fighting Germany United Press, Washington, 31st â€“ It was officially announced here yesterday that President Roosevelt has sent Hopkins to Moscow to discuss promoting the shipment of U.S. military supplies to the Soviet Union. Hopkins, the co-ordinator of the Aid to Britain program, arrived in Moscow by plane on July 29. Deputy Secretary of State Welles said that Hopkins flew from London to Moscow at the direct request of President Roosevelt, because he knew best the volume of American production and what was most suitable for handling the needs of the Soviet Union and other countries. Welles also said that Hopkins' mission was the same as that of the Soviet delegation that recently arrived here, but that the U.S. had not discussed with the Soviet delegation the possibility of assisting the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease Act. TASS, Moscow, 31st â€“ To immediately hold talks with Soviet officials on the supplies that the United States can provide to the Soviet Union, President Roosevelt sent Hopkins to Moscow. Harry Hopkins, President Roosevelt's personal envoy, has arrived in Moscow, accompanied by aviation experts McNaeny and John Allison. Those who greeted him included Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Lozovsky, U.S. Ambassador Steinhardt, and British Ambassador Cripps. In addition, Molotov, Minister of the Treaties Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, and Lieutenant Colonel Petrushkin, Deputy Chief of the Foreign Affairs Department of the People's Commissariat for National Defense, went to the border to meet Hopkins and escort him back to Moscow. TASS, Moscow, 31st â€“ Stalin met yesterday with Harry Hopkins, President Roosevelt's personal envoy. Those who participated in the talks included U.S. Ambassador Steinhardt and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov. Hopkins Speaks TASS, Moscow, 31st â€“ Hopkins, President Roosevelt's personal envoy, met with foreign reporters and made the following statement: "President Roosevelt instructed me to come to Moscow to meet with Stalin as the President's personal representative. Last night, I met with Stalin and Molotov. I expect to meet with Stalin two or three more times before I leave here. What we are talking about is the issue of the Soviet-German war. Under President Roosevelt's instructions, I have clearly told Stalin that "the U.S. believes that anyone who fights against Hitler is on the right side, and is determined to provide this side with all kinds of assistance. We greatly admire the Soviet Union for fighting for its own defense." I and Stalin have discussed the types and quantities of various items that the U.S. will supply to the Soviet Union. I cannot publish the details at this time. Tonight, I will meet with various members of the Soviet government, and tomorrow afternoon, I will meet with Stalin again. He has given me a special letter to convey to President Roosevelt. In that letter, in addition to expressing gratitude to President Roosevelt for his enthusiasm for assistance, he firmly stated that the U.S. government and people are deeply convinced that the Soviet Union will defeat Hitler, and the Soviet Union will not let the U.S. down in this confidence and expectation." Hopkins then answered questions from the reporters. According to him, there will be no difficulties regarding the delivery of goods and payment. He continued, this visit to Moscow was initiated by President Roosevelt, and authorized by the President to discuss various methods of fighting Hitler. Finally, he said that as a result of his inspection of Moscow, he found that the Russians are extremely confident. The German planes bombed the Soviet capital, and the Soviet losses were very small. The Soviet-Polish Agreement is Concluded in an Atmosphere of Harmony. Reuters, London, 30th â€“ The Soviet-Polish Agreement was signed in the British Foreign Office in a simple ceremony. The Prime Minister presided over the ceremony, with Eden and Polish Prime Minister Sikorski on his right, and Soviet Ambassador Maisky and Soviet Embassy Counselor Novikov on his left. The Polish and Russian texts of the agreement were placed in front of the representatives of the two countries, and each signed their respective texts. After signing, Eden briefly offered his congratulations. Sikorski, Maisky, and Churchill also followed suit. Then, Eden handed a diplomatic note to Sikorski, and the Polish Prime Minister also handed a reply note to Eden. The ceremony ended in an atmosphere of harmony. After shaking hands, Eden went to the House of Commons to announce the signing of the agreement. Diplomatic Notes Exchanged between Britain and Poland Reuters, London, 31st â€“ Foreign Secretary Eden announced the conclusion of the Soviet-Polish agreement in the House of Commons, and everyone greeted it with loud cheers. Eden said that after Poland and the Soviet Union signed the agreement, he sent the following diplomatic note to Polish Prime Minister Sikorski: "I am pleased to take this opportunity to inform Your Excellency that, in accordance with the provisions of the British-Polish Mutual Assistance Agreement of August 29, 1939, the British government has not entered into any commitment with the Soviet Union that could affect Soviet-Polish relations. I also wish to assure Your Excellency that the British government will not recognize any territorial changes within Poland since 1939." The reply note handed to Eden by Sikorski was as follows: "The Polish government has received Your Excellency's letter of July 30 and is pleased to read that the British government will not recognize any territorial changes within Poland since August 1939, which is in line with the views of the Polish government, which has previously informed the British government that it will not recognize any territorial changes within Poland since the outbreak of the current war." Foreign Secretary Eden Delivers a Speech Eden continued, "The Soviet-Polish Agreement states that the Soviet government recognizes that the Soviet-German treaty of 1939 regarding territorial changes in Poland has become invalid. The British government's attitude has been stated by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on September 5, 1940, that the British government does not intend to recognize any changes in land during wartime without the voluntary consent and goodwill of all parties concerned. This also applies to territorial changes in Poland after August 1939, which I have informed the Polish government of accordingly. As for Poland's future borders with other European countries, referring to the words in the aforementioned British speech, Eden concluded, I believe that Members of the House of Commons will agree that the signing of this agreement between the Soviet Union and Poland will be warmly congratulated. This historic event will lay a solid foundation for the mutual cooperation between Poland and the Soviet Union in this war against a common enemy (loud cheers), and will make a valuable contribution to the goals of the Allied countries (loud cheers), which will not only be warmly received throughout the British Empire, but will also be warmly welcomed by all friendly countries (loud cheers). Eden, answering supplementary questions, stated that the exchanged diplomatic notes he had just read did not involve any guarantees of borders by the British government. Members of the House of Commons Extend Their Congratulations Liberal Party Member of Parliament Harris asked whether the conditions of the agreement are our intention and whether the agreement is mutually applicable to the two governments. Eden replied "Yes." He also said, "In view of past history, we should send congratulatory messages to the authorities of the two countries that have signed this agreement." Labour Party Member of Parliament Smith asked, "Since there is a large potential Polish army within the Soviet Union, will the Foreign Secretary do his utmost to equip the troops there as soon as possible?" Eden replied, "This is a matter for the Soviet Union, but we have never forgotten the great value of quickly organizing and equipping the Polish army in the Soviet Union for the purposes of the Allied countries during the negotiations." Member of Parliament Belisha expressed his congratulations to Eden for mediating the conclusion of the Polish-Soviet agreement and for being a good omen for the new order in Europe, and asked Eden to announce this matter so that Hitler would also know that this was the result of his arbitrary attack on the Soviet Union.

Soviet Troops Continue Counterattacks German Troops Repulsed Everywhere "Great Germany" Infantry Regiment Annihilated A Fire Breaks Out at the Tieluo Oil Field After Being Hit by Shells TASS, Moscow, 31st â€“ The Soviet Information Bureau issued a war report for the night of the 20th, stating that during the day, in the areas of Novgorod, Nevel, Zhytomyr, and Smolensk, our troops continued to fight against the enemy. The battles were most intense in the latter two areas. There were no major battles in other areas. Our air force, in conjunction with the army's infantry, continued to strike enemy tank units, infantry units, and air force. Our air force also bombed Proletarsk and Sulin, causing fires. According to preliminary statistics, our air force shot down nine German planes on the 29th. We lost five planes. TASS, Moscow, 31st â€“ The German army suffered extremely heavy losses in the Smolensk area. A few days ago, the Red Army completely annihilated the "Great Germany" Motorized Infantry Regiment. The regiment suffered 2,000 deaths and injuries, and hundreds of people were captured. A large amount of military supplies were also intercepted. Hitler attached great importance to the "Great Germany" infantry. The regiment was established last year, and all officers and soldiers belonged to the guard of the German government agencies, and were all 1.7 meters tall, and absolutely loyal to Fascism. Reuters, Moscow, 31st â€“ The German war report claims that they are being blocked from advancing along the long Soviet front line, and cannot advance. The Soviet public communique reports that the areas around Smolensk in the central district and Zhytomyr in Ukraine are still in war, while no major battles have occurred in other parts of the front line. The communique also said that there are extremely fierce battles around Smolensk. The Soviet army has launched a counterattack, heavily damaging the enemy army. According to Lozovsky of the Soviet Information Bureau, German troops everywhere have been repulsed, and several German teams have been surrounded. In some places, the Soviet army's counterattacks have pushed the enemy back by more than a hundred miles. The Soviet Air Force is also active, bombing Romanian oil fields. Moscow Radio said that according to experts, the output of Romanian oil wells will be reduced by at least half in the coming months, even if they are not subjected to continued bombing. Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 31st â€“ This afternoon's German military report stated that the German army in Ukraine is pursuing the Soviet army, penetrating deep into enemy positions. The German army in Estonia forced the enemy to retreat northward. Last night, the German fighter group and bomber group fiercely bombed Moscow's military facilities and the railway station in Voronezh. Havas News Agency, Moscow, 31st â€“ The Intelligence Department issued a war report this morning stating that a large number of German planes attempted to bomb here again last night, but the German planes did not enter the sky over the capital due to the fierce resistance of our fighter planes and anti-aircraft gun teams. One German plane was shot down. We did not lose any planes. German military circles acknowledge that the Soviet army has good training. Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 31st â€“ German military circles commented that the Eastern Front war has lasted for six weeks so far. The Soviet army is indeed well prepared and trained in modern tactics. The Soviet Union has attempted to resist the German army's advance with all of its experience in cut-off tactics. However, the Soviet Union has not achieved its expected results. Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 31st â€“ The authorities announced last night that northeast of Smolensk, the German army destroyed 230 Soviet tanks in 48 hours. This number is equal to all the vehicles in a Soviet Panzer Division, which is 50% more than what Soviet industry produces in a month. Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 31st â€“ According to sources here this morning, when the German army occupied two Soviet cities in the Upper Dnieper region, they captured more than 10,000 Soviet troops and 106 cannons, equal to the artillery equipment of two Soviet divisions. In addition, they captured 58 flat-fire guns, 392 machine guns, 300 passenger cars and automobiles, 300 other vehicles, 750 horses, and one airplane. Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 31st â€“ Responsible authorities stated that the German-Finnish joint forces continued to win victories in attacking the enemy army. After a fierce battle, the retreating Soviet army poured gasoline on the forest in an attempt to stop the pursuit of the enemy army, but it failed. The joint forces are still driving the fleeing army through the burning forest.

British and American Freezing of Funds Does Not Affect China Applications for foreign exchange can still be made for legitimate purposes. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi declared in Chongqing yesterday. Chongqing â€“ Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi declared today that China has no reason to worry about the freezing of Chinese funds by Britain and the United States. He specified that applications for foreign exchange can still be made for the needs of the Chinese government and other legitimate purposes. Kong Xiangxi also stated that the Chinese authorities and the Bank of China are rapidly issuing general licenses, and other general licenses will be issued successively in order to minimize obstacles to normal commerce. Dr. Kong Xiangxi reiterated President Roosevelt's previous statement that the implementation of the license system will be based on the wishes of the Chongqing government and the continued U.S. aid to China policy in order to strengthen the Chinese government's foreign trade and foreign exchange position. Kong also said that Fox, chairman of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, has now completed his investigation of the economic and financial situation in Hong Kong, Free China, and Shanghai. He has received orders to implement U.S. policy, and the Chinese government has requested to cooperate with him. (United Press Dispatch, 31st) The Japanese Air Force is Declining Central Daily News Commentary Chongqing â€“ The Central Daily News commented on the Japanese Air Force, saying that its army and navy have about 2,000 first-line and reserve aircraft. Its aviation industry can manufacture 1,000 aircraft per year, but it lacks materials, its technology is generally inferior, and its engine production is limited and not advanced. Therefore, it must import a large number of engines and finished aircraft every year. Since the invasion of China, the lack of foreign exchange

With Money Give Money, With Strength Give Strength - Jue Hui

Those young people who lack the means to seek knowledge but possess a high desire for it have had their long-awaited dreams realized - the Shen Bao Scholarship has received widespread sympathy and assistance!

The situation was quite good from the very beginning. We can see the righteous acts of tea servers making monthly donations; but there are already "rich old men" participating in this matter, which is not a "miracle"!

The eight characters "With money give money; with strength give strength" have long been "ringing in our ears," and originally there was no need to elaborate further; however, when we see the fervent emotions of those who barely have enough to maintain the minimum standard of living, and the indifference of some of the leisure class who continue to eat their big meals and sit in their cars, the re-raising of this slogan is not "superfluous."

In short, everyone hopes that those with money will donate as much as possible, those without money will bravely contribute their efforts, and everyone will work hard to solicit donations from relatives and friends!

Offering a "child's heart" to society and the nation is precisely an indirect expression of patriotism; moreover, how deeply the motherland expects studious young students!

### A Husband Who Doesn't Come Home - Zhong Wenling

Better to Remain Still Than to Make a Move
I Don't Want to Lack Anything

Since I moved into the dormitory inside the office, it hasn't been just Little Yang who's been teasing me, but I hate him the most. My usual impression of him is already very bad, because that fellow's head is small, but he has a pair of very large front teeth, so when he smiles, his whole head seems to consist only of two teeth, and that appearance is really annoying, just like a cricket! A cruel creature devoid of all sympathy. Now he's even given me a nickname that I can't wash away for a while! A husband who doesn't come home!

Although I have sacrificed my wife's love and the happiness of my family, and I'm also being ridiculed by my colleagues, these are all just mental pains, they are intangible; in reality, the benefits I receive are tangible, so in the end, I am able to take it in stride.

This is a very special period. Originally, those who take cars can switch to chartered cars, those who take chartered cars can switch to trams or buses, and those who originally took buses can naturally walk. However, the road from Rue Lallot to the Bund is really not short. How can I "take it" in stride? Moreover, I have to cherish my rubber-soled shoes, because now a pair from Great China costs several dollars. So moving into the office saves me a considerable amount of money right off the bat.

Now at home, there is only my wife and a small child - he is too young to be eligible to study, so after they eat dinner and have nothing to do, they can go to bed early. If I were at home, it would be different. I want to read books, I want to write things. After dinner, I would flip through this and look at that, not going to bed until midnight, sometimes even one or two in the morning, and the electric lights would of course be on until then. According to my wife, since I moved to the office, the electric lights at home are almost never turned on, which makes the sub-landlord ecstatic.

The environment at home is really too bad, it's terribly noisy, and it gets even worse at night. The ding-ding-dong-dong of the radio and the clack-clack-clack of mahjong mingle together, and sometimes a drunken Russian suddenly opens his broken bamboo throat and belts out a song, scaring your soul half to heaven. In the office, after dinner, everyone scatters like birds and beasts; some go to the theater, some go for a stroll, and at this time, the dormitory is so quiet that it can't be quieter, so I can write something in peace.

Before moving to the office, I often waited until after dinner before going home, but that was always a little difficult to justify. Now, I don't feel that way anymore.

Of course, there are many other trivial reasons why I don't go home. For example, with rice so expensive, who wants to support another little one? We need spiritual nourishment!

### Chang Min Creates Begonia for "Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship" - Qin Shouou

Eleven. Phantom of the Opera

With Feng Meibao's talent and the fact that she had studied to the point of almost graduating from junior high school, learning opera was as easy as she herself had imagined. The seemingly incoherent phrases that Old Shang uttered, she had the ability to memorize them all. When she came across a word whose meaning she didn't understand, she could even think of a homophone to replace it. Moreover, she had a good ear. The long passages, the short passages, she could remember them after hearing them once. Therefore, in the hall of the Meng family, she studied opera continuously with Old Shang for half a month, and everything went as smoothly as water flowing from a high place to a low place.

But Qiu Haitang's energy gradually recovered. After he got out of bed, he noticed that Meibao's actions were a bit abnormal. In the past, she was most reluctant to go to the homes of her neighbors, but now, she had to go to the Meng family in the north of the street every day. At first, Qiu Haitang thought it was because when he was sick, the Meng family's little shopkeeper came over to take care of him from time to time, and he gradually became familiar with Meibao, and they got along well, so they had to see each other every day. But after observing for a few days, he felt that this guess was a bit wrong. Because Meibao not only had to run over there twice a day, but the times she went were also fixed. The first time was in the morning, the second time was in the afternoon; if she went a little later, the Meng family's little shopkeeper would immediately come over to look for her. It just so happened that Qiu Haitang couldn't go to the fields after his illness, and he sat in the hall picking beans and preparing to grind wheat every day, so he saw everything very clearly every time.

"Meibao, what does Mrs. Meng across the street ask you to do every day?" One morning, he really couldn't bear it anymore, so before Meibao was about to walk out the door, he asked her this question.

Meibao almost got caught off guard by his question. (173)

### A Group Being Teased - Shiyuan

Teasing often visits our group - a group of miserable female workers.

In the early morning and at dusk, this kind of obscene trick is not difficult to discover, whether you are on the road or on the side of the street. A full day's work, a tired body, and an empty stomach are already hard enough, but they are still bumped into, and even their arms and faces are pinched. When crossing the road, they are subjected to coal ash and phlegm from trucks, and leering and foul language. This kind of insult has never been seen to be interfered with, and is even treated as watching a play, with despicable smiles being emitted.

Alas! Aren't we female workers human beings? With weak bodies, enduring the misery of a full day in the factory, regardless of the sweltering heat or severe cold, "they are also teased while working, to get food and lodging, and when they come out, they are treated as teasing targets. Who doesn't have a wife and children, who doesn't have sisters? If you have wives, daughters, and sisters, and you insult others, can you guarantee that they won't receive the same treatment? (It's not necessarily just female workers who get teased) What will you do then?

It is true that most of them are ignorant members of the working class, but are those who stand by and watch also ignorant? Why don't they help us righteously? I don't understand.

In fact, the managers and foremen in the factory should also bear some of this responsibility.

### How to "Rely on Favors"? - Wu Wenbin

Someone sent a "death announcement," and when I looked at it, I only knew the name of the person involved but not his face.

"You're sending an invitation even though you don't know them?" I couldn't help but blurt out. Mr. Zhang was by my side and chimed in:

"If you don't know them, then just ignore it."

"But it's a little too difficult to do!" I said.

"No, anyway, he'll definitely blame the person who delivered the invitation for losing it." Mr. Zhang seemed to be confident.

"So you're someone who's been through this before?" I jokingly said.

"Of course. Not only those I don't know, but even those I do know. Sometimes when my pockets are empty, I just bite the bullet and don't send a gift."

"Isn't that a bit inhumane?" I said.

"No! But if you happen to run into this friend of yours in the future, you must first ask him why he didn't give you a wedding invitation (assuming it's a wedding) and didn't invite you to a wedding feast. If you say that, not only will he not look down on you, but he will respectfully apologize to you!"

"This method is actually good, but it wrongs the person who delivers the invitation. I think if this trend catches on, the person who delivers the invitation will have to bring a 'receipt book' with them to get a receipt."

### Art World Movie History Shanghai's Early Film Industry - Bao Jun

The earliest development of film in Shanghai was as far back as the 25th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, the films were not shown on the silver screen in theaters, but on white cloth screens in the Shengping Tea House on Fuzhou Road. The films shown were all incomplete and old. Later, a Spaniard named Jia Lunbo, who ran the business, replaced them with eight Western short films, which were shown successively at the Hongkou Zapu Road Ice Rink and the Hubei Road Jin Gu Xiang Western Restaurant. At first, this emerging entertainment was able to attract a large audience, but over time, it suffered a disastrous business failure because there were no new films to replace them. Jia Lunbo then transferred the business to his friend Lei Masi (Ramos) to take over. In the 34th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, Lei Masi built the Hongkou Grand Theater on Zapu Road with lead skin. It was Shanghai's first official movie theater. The first official feature film shown publicly in Shanghai was "The Dragon Nest," which was shown at the opening of the theater. Although the facilities of the theater were very simple, because Lei's management was effective, moviegoers flocked to it, and the business was booming. Lei then built the Victoria Grand Theater (later renamed New Central) on North Sichuan Road, with new equipment, luxurious decorations, and magnificent architecture. It seemed to dominate the entire city of Shanghai. At this time, due to the rapid advancement of the times, movie theaters in Shanghai sprung up like mushrooms after rain, and the film industry flourished day by day.

In the first year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty, an American named Sa Fa saw that foreign films were thriving in Shanghai. He believed that filming and showing Chinese films would be even more sensational, so he brought together Zheng Zhengqiu, Zhang Shichuan, Qian Huabao, and others from the New Drama Circle to establish the Asia Film Company at No. 4 Hong Kong Road. This was China's first film company. The company's first productions were four short films, including "Butterfly Dream" and "Big and Small Scams." Subsequently, it filmed several films that were transformed from civilized dramas, such as "Living Monk," "Black Record Wronged Soul," "Zhuangzi Splitting the Coffin," "Empress Dowager Cixi," and "Second Uncle Visiting the City God Temple." After the Asia Film Company closed down, the authorities of the Commercial Press deeply felt the importance of film art in education, so they established a film department in the library to film educational films. China's film industry has made rapid progress and has developed rapidly, reaching the prosperous scene of today. The new face on the silver screen, Zhang Cuiying, is now a new force in Yi Hua.

### About Drama Artists and Dance - Shen

Xia Yuan, a dancer who is as famous as Wu Xiaobang in the art world, has recently established the Drama Artist Dance Institute, specializing in providing drama artists with rigorous training in movement and expression.

According to Xia Yuan, dance is of great help to drama, such as how to move the eyes, how to raise the eyebrows, as well as the posture of walking, the tone of voice, smiling, sneering, laughing, etc. These are all based on the contraction of muscles, and the contraction of muscles can be slowly trained.

The Drama Artist Dance Institute is scheduled to open on August 1, and is divided into three groups: adult men's group, adult women's group, and children's group. The courses include movement exercises and theoretical research. They take two months as a term, and graduate in three terms. The practice place is in the Xuan Palace Theater.

Those who have signed up to join are very enthusiastic, and most of them are artists.

In today's booming spoken drama industry, the contribution of the Drama Artist Dance Institute is very powerful. When Wu Xiaobang was in Shanghai before, he also did this work, and the talents he cultivated are now scattered in various drama troupes and film companies. This time, Xia Yuan is reorganizing his forces, which is naturally something we should be happy about.

The reporter hopes that they will not engage in empty talk, but earnestly bury their heads in hard work. Yes, in this difficult era, what our art circle needs are some young people who are willing to work hard, can endure hardship, and are brave enough to forge ahead, with thoughts and spirit.

### The Flowers and Moon of the Singing Stage - Kou Hong

The Nanjing Book Market is currently the only territory of the Shanghai Puyushe. After Shen Yuying, Zui Yixian, Xie Xiaotian, and others of the Puyushe retired one after another, there has been a feeling of talent being scarce. Recently, Xu Xueyue, Xie Yaotian, and others have also married one after another. After marriage, they no longer hold the pipa and ascend to the singing stage. In the southeast half, only Wang Meiyun, Gu Yanqin, and Xu Xuehua are relied upon to support the remaining situation. There are too few talents, and when you look at them, it's always these few faces. When you listen to them, it's always these few familiar books. This should be the main reason for the Puyushe's decline. Among the Puyushe girls, there is one Yan Songjun who has been leaping on the book stage but has never come to Shanghai; and there is one Tang Yuexian who has been separated from Shanghai people for many years and makes people look forward to her appearance. If the host of Puyushe can find these two beauties to come to Shanghai, they may be able to revitalize the remaining situation, which is not necessarily impossible.

The "Shuoyun Opera Troupe," which performs daily at the Era Theater, is mostly made up of children who are not yet adults, but their performances all follow the "main road," adhere to the rules, do not slack off, do not try to be clever, and do not use "oily accents," which is really commendable. The leading female role, Xiao Meimei, has a handsome appearance and a beautiful stage presence. Commentators say that she can surpass Wu Suqiu. If she can take good care of herself, she will definitely "break out" in the future! The old male role, Xiao Fangshuo, is also a girl. She is not yet fifteen years old, but her kung fu is naturally mature, and she is also a beautiful talent.

### Double Blossoms of Blood - Gu Mingdao

Chapter Thirteen: Refusing to Bow Down in the Wilderness

The next day, the two prepared to set off, and the old monk Zhiyuan came to see them off. Liu Yinying and Xu Jing first led their steeds out the door, then carried their luggage onto the horses, and then closed all the doors and windows and put iron locks on the gate. The lock key was handed over to the old monk Zhiyuan, entrusting him to take care of everything. The two then said goodbye to Zhiyuan, rode their steeds on the road, left Phoenix Ridge, ran down Weifeng Mountain, and headed towards Ningyuan. At first, they encountered refugees fleeing everywhere, displaced and migrating, in a state of misery and suffering. I am afraid that Zheng Xia's Refugee Picture would be hard pressed to depict even a fraction of it. They also heard that General Jiang Rang of Datong had surrendered to the rebels, and that Li Chuang was likely to invade the capital soon. Naturally, the two were also very worried. They traveled by day and rested by night, hurrying on their journey. One day, the two were so eager to get on the road that they missed the lodging and ended up running all night. They ate in the wind and drank in the dew, traversing mountains and rivers. The hardship was extraordinary. When they arrived in Yanjing, they saw that although some people in the capital were secretly discussing the rampage of the rebels and the threat to the capital, most people were still like swallows nesting under a dangerous curtain and fish swimming in a boiling pot, still singing and dancing, and the upper and lower classes were complacent. The two felt that this situation was no different from placing firewood under a house, and that disaster was imminent. The Great Ming Dynasty was truly in imminent danger. Although they had heard that Emperor Chongzhen was a wise ruler, the court officials were all incompetent and mediocre people, complacent and opportunistic, and did not take national affairs to heart, making it difficult for Emperor Chongzhen to have the heart to quell the rebellion, and without capable ministers, what good would it do? The two stayed in Beijing for one day and night, and because they wanted to get to Ningyuan early, they immediately set out and left the pass. They arrived at Ningyuan City early the next day. At that time, Ningyuan was an important town outside the pass. The Ming Dynasty stationed heavy troops here to deal with the invasion of Manchuria. Nurhaci, the Lord of Manchuria, took Shenyang and then led a large army to attack Ningyuan. At first, it was Governor Yuan Chonghuan who was stationed here, resourceful and well-prepared. Nurhaci besieged it for a long time, but in the end, he could not take Ningyuan. Instead, he was wounded by artillery fire and could not help but sigh: "Since I raised troops at the age of twenty-five, I have won every battle and conquered every city. How could I not be able to take this mere city of Ningyuan? Is this not the will of Heaven?" He was very depressed and had no choice but to withdraw his troops, and soon died of illness. Later, the Ming Dynasty believed the words of discord and unjustly killed Yuan Chonghuan, destroying its own Great Wall. Knowing the importance of this place, General Wu Sanzhong was soon stationed there. However, the enemy troops were pressing in, and there was a rebellion of rebels within the pass. General Wu did not make any special achievements in Ningyuan. (130)

### American Gunboat "Tutura" Anchored in Chongqing Bombed by Japanese - Japanese Foreign Minister Toyoda Expresses Apology - U.S. Congress Sternly Condemns Japan as Hostile Action - Demands Immediate Retaliatory Action Against Japan

Chongqing - On the 30th, Japanese planes attacked Chongqing, dropping many bombs near the American warship "Tutura." The canvas awning on the ship's deck was destroyed, and a motorboat at the stern was sunk by a bomb. (30th Telegram)

Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Minister Toyoda met with U.S. Ambassador Grew at the U.S. Embassy today, expressing sincere regret for the damage to the American ship "Tutura" during the Japanese air raid on Chongqing. After apologizing, Toyoda stated that Japan had taken special steps to avoid similar incidents in the future. He also stated that the Japanese government had issued urgent orders to all Japanese military commanders abroad, instructing them not to damage American property. Toyoda met with Grew in the afternoon. Prior to this, Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Yamamoto also went to the U.S. Embassy to apologize to Grew for the incident. (31st Reuters Telegram)

Tokyo - Acting Foreign Minister Yamamoto visited U.S. Ambassador Grew this morning, expressing regret for the bombing of the American gunboat "Tutura" by Japanese planes during yesterday's air raid on Chongqing. (31st Reuters Telegram)

Tokyo - According to reliable sources, the U.S. Embassy is now lodging a protest with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the bombing of the American gunboat "Tutura" by Japanese planes during yesterday's air raid on Chongqing. When U.S. Ambassador Grew met with Foreign Minister Toyoda this afternoon, Toyoda expressed deep regret for the bombing of the American gunboat. The U.S. Ambassador protested the Japanese side's investigation of the news. (31st Reuters Telegram)

Reuters, Washington, 31st - The Navy Department announced that the American gunboat "Tutura" was damaged by Japanese bombs during the air raid on Chongqing, but no one was injured. Several bombs landed on the ship, slightly damaging the stern, deck, structure, and a small motorboat. A Navy spokesman said that the ship was anchored in a safe zone across the river from Chongqing. The U.S. government has lodged a serious protest with Japan. After consulting with President Roosevelt by telephone, Acting Secretary of State Welles visited Japanese Ambassador Nomura and informed him that the U.S. government had received reports that 26 Japanese planes had flown over Chongqing and dropped bombs on the gunboat "Tutura" and other American properties. As the location of the gunboat and other properties was separated from Chongqing city by the Yangtze River, the United States believes that there is no reason for the Japanese bombers to have dropped the bombs by mistake.

Chongqing - Officials of the American gunboat "Tutura" revealed today that Japanese bombers dropped bombs near the ship yesterday, causing damage to the ship. One of the ship's motorboats was destroyed, and another larger launch was damaged. It could not be determined whether the Japanese planes dropped the bombs intentionally, as the Japanese planes were at an altitude of 15,000 feet, making it very difficult to see. However, according to eyewitnesses on the south bank, some Japanese planes were seen breaking away from the formation and flying towards the American ship. When the bombers arrived, the guns of the American ship were ready, but they did not fire. The ship has nine old-fashioned three-inch caliber machine guns for anti-aircraft use, but they probably cannot reach an altitude of 15,000 feet, and the Japanese planes usually attack Chongqing at an altitude of 15,000 feet. (31st Associated Press Telegram)

Reuters, Chongqing, 31st - During yesterday's Japanese air raid, in addition to the American gunboat "Tutura" being damaged by bombs, a Standard Oil station was also hit by a bomb, and a bomb also fell outside an American's house. The estimated loss for the oil station and other properties is 50,000 yuan. Fortunately, the bombs dropped were not large, otherwise the losses would have been even greater.

Associated Press, Washington, 31st - The U.S. government yesterday sent a note to the Japanese government regarding the bombing of the American gunboat "Tutura" by Japanese planes during the air raid on Chongqing. According to reports from Chongqing, bombs fell near the gunboat and exploded near the U.S. Embassy. The American gunboat was anchored in the so-called "safe zone" on the south bank of the Yangtze River, but it was still damaged. Undersecretary of State Welles stated that the note was presented after Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Nomura visited Welles and convened a press conference. The Undersecretary of State refused to call the note a "protest," but it is widely believed that this action indicates that the United States considers the Japanese attack on the American flag to be a serious matter. Welles stated that the U.S. government learned yesterday morning that 26 Japanese bombers dropped bombs near the American gunboat "Tutura" and the U.S. Embassy in Chongqing. He said that he did not wish to criticize the matter at this time, but only wished to point out that the U.S. Embassy and the American gunboat were on the opposite side of the Yangtze River from the main part of Chongqing.

Associated Press, Washington, 31st - Furious members of Congress yesterday sternly condemned the Japanese bombing of the American gunboat "Tutura" and demanded that the United States take immediate retaliatory action against Japan. The U.S. government has also presented a note to the Japanese government regarding this matter. Members of Congress believe that this was an intentional act and should be retaliated against immediately. Congress also called on the United States to express strong dissatisfaction with this. Massachusetts Democratic Congressman and House Majority Leader McCormack called it an "act of hostility," clearly indicating that Japan has now become Hitler's forward outpost for attacking the United States. This is a very serious intentional act, and the government cannot allow this matter to pass lightly without taking action. Congressman Johnson of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said that the actions of "these Japanese" have gone too far. Congressman Coffee said that the government must end its policy of appeasement towards Japan. At the same time, it is said that Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Nomura insisted that this was an accidental event. Reliable sources here believe that Japan is taking an opportunistic approach, observing the weaknesses of democracies in order to attack the Soviet Union, Malaya, or other American territories in the Far East. Observers believe that Japan's strength has been weakened after entering the fifth year of its war against China, but it is still forced to continue the war. Japan's next action will be determined by the outcome of the Soviet-German war or developments in the Dutch East Indies.
