The President's inaugural ceremony will be broadcast throughout Europe and the Americas, and the inaugural address will be translated into at least seven languages for domestic broadcast. President Roosevelt is the first person in American history to be sworn in for a third time as President. (Reuters, 19th)

American Defense Council Leaders Endorse Aid to Britain Bill

America's Safety Would Be Hard to Guarantee if Britain Were to be Defeated; Defense Programs Proceeding Smoothly

Washington - Knudsen, the leader of the Defense Council, testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, urging the swift passage of the bill, stating that its passage is part of America's defense. When the committee asked if he was satisfied with the progress of the defense program, Knudsen replied that he was, and that the defense program is proceeding smoothly, but that a true indication will only be possible when the tools are available. (Reuters, 19th)

Washington - Chairman Knudsen of the Defense Committee testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that if Britain were to fall, America would ultimately have to fight the Axis powers. Therefore, Knudsen strongly urged the committee to pass the Aid to Britain Bill. At that time, Massachusetts Representative Edith Nourse Rogers suggested requiring Britain to relinquish raw materials such as tin, rubber, and aluminum as collateral. Knudsen replied, "Collateral would be a good thing, but wouldn't we be going too far by demanding it?" Mrs. Rogers then asked if the United States would assume the role of world police. Knudsen replied no, and continued, "The progress of the defense program is not entirely satisfactory at present, but I believe that it will achieve everything expected of it in the future." The current delay in military production means that the full equipment for the 2.2 million-man army originally planned last summer, as well as the military equipment for another 800,000 men, will not be completed until the end of 1942. The delay in military equipment is especially severe, including heavy artillery, heavy ammunition, and machine guns. He further stated that the bill must be passed even if Britain's payments are zero, and that aid must be provided now, as time and speed are the most important factors, and it is absolutely essential for the United States to be fully armed and capable of protecting its coast. Even if this bill is passed immediately, the increased price of aid to Britain will not be seen until the end of 1941; otherwise, only existing American military equipment can be given to Britain.

Kennedy Broadcasts; Strongly Advocates Avoiding War

Urges the Nation to Support the President; British Morale is High and They Will Not Fail

New York - Former Ambassador to Britain, Joseph Kennedy, broadcasted a speech to the nation last night, attacking President Roosevelt's Aid to Britain Bill, stating that, according to his belief, the United States is not currently in such great danger that Congress needs to relinquish its authority. After the bill is reviewed by both houses, a more moderate approach will emerge, "to grant the President new powers, but no matter how the new approach appears, the responsibility of every American citizen remains very clear, which is to rise up and support the President." Kennedy advocated directly giving Britain military equipment, arms and aircraft, but insisted that the United States must stay away from war unless attacked, recognizing that war is the bankruptcy of democratic countries. Even if victorious, the United States would have to be on guard in Europe for decades to prevent the defeated countries from becoming communist. If the United States declares war, it will not make Britain win quickly, nor will it increase Britain's strength to match Germany. "A just peace is absolutely impossible to see in Europe at this time, because Hitler has closed this path." Currently, Germany cannot conquer Britain because of the twenty miles of water separating them, so it will not be able to cross the Atlantic to attack the United States in the future, and the United States has no hope of occupying Europe. (United Press, 19th)

New York - Former Ambassador to Britain, Joseph Kennedy, forcefully refuted defamatory messages spread since his return from Britain in a broadcast last night, stating that when he arrived in the United States, he declared that staying out of the war was what the United States could and should do, but that all kinds of aid should be given to Britain. His position was the same then as it is now. However, some people have made various false accusations about his views on foreign policy. Those who question the possibility of British victory are labeled as defeatists. He said that the American people send ambassadors to other countries in the hope that they will report to the nation both the bright and dark sides of the country, that is, their strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, when he reported to the government on the difficulties faced by the British people, he spoke of both the strengths and weaknesses of Britain, because he wanted the government to obtain all possible information so that it could follow it in determining its foreign policy and not be restricted by the results of the war. He did not foresee the failure of Britain. The morale of the British people is indescribable. But what is known of the German war spirit and the German morale? If we do not know this, then the prediction of British failure is completely unconscious. Some people have accused him of being an appeaser, but in fact, the charge that he advocated compromise with the dictatorships is completely fabricated. The words of dictators have long been worthless. Hitler, who has unleashed the tide of war, has closed the door to peace to the world and declared total war in order to create a new world order. If this new order is established, it will be impossible for our just society to exist. Speaking of the possibility of Hitler declaring war on the United States, Kennedy said that in this era of rampant violence, undeclared war is prevalent. However, Hitler will wait until he believes the time is most advantageous before declaring war on the United States. The actions of the United States, in Hitler's view, are a violation of neutrality and sufficient reason to declare war on the United States. (Reuters, 19th)

### Chairman Lin Cables Congratulations

Chongqing - According to diplomatic sources, the 20th is the date of President Roosevelt's third inauguration. Chairman Lin of our country has sent a congratulatory telegram. The telegram reads, "On the joyous occasion of Your Excellency's third inauguration, I extend my sincere congratulations on behalf of the National Government and the people of the nation.

### Willkie Ordered to Britain for Investigation; Will Meet With Roosevelt Before Departure

Washington - The White House announced yesterday that President Roosevelt has instructed Secretary of State Hull to convey all information regarding the European situation and American policy to Wendell Willkie, the former Republican presidential candidate who will be going to Britain to investigate the current situation. Tomorrow, Hull will meet with Willkie to exchange views. At that time, Hull will provide all kinds of information in accordance with the President's instructions. It is reported that Willkie is scheduled to depart for Britain on January 23. Willkie stated today that he intends to meet with President Roosevelt once before his departure. (Reuters, 19th)

Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday instructed Secretary of State Hull to inform Willkie of all the details of the government's foreign policy before Willkie goes to Britain. According to reliable sources, Willkie may be given a position in the government after he returns. On this point, the government side pointed out that former President Wilson appointed Taft as Attorney General after defeating Taft in 1913, which is a precedent. (International News Service, 19th)

### Secretary of the Navy Knox Delivers Speech; America's Aid to Democratic Countries Should Not Be Conditional

New York - Secretary of the Navy Knox delivered a speech last night, stating that if the United States were to quibble about the conditions of aiding China, Britain, and Greece, it would be difficult to maintain its self-respect. The men, women, and children of Britain are all standing on the front lines of war for the principles upon which America's entire system of self-government is based. (Reuters, 19th)

Washington - Virginia Democratic Senator Glass stated yesterday that the United States should now declare war on Germany, and also stated that he personally "would like to see Hitler sink to the bottom of the sea." (19th telegram)

### Japan Feels Apprehensive About America's Uncompromising Attitude

Tokyo - The Japan Times and Guangzhi Report reported that the American people should make greater efforts to understand the position of other countries. An obstinate and uncompromising attitude will only make the already extremely dangerous situation more serious. The newspaper asked Secretary of State Hull that if the United States were in the same situation as Japan, could it have acted differently? It stated that looking at America's own policies is enough to make people surprised that America dares to criticize Japan so much. The newspaper also stated that the basis of the US-Japan conflict is the policy of interventionists. If the United States continues its policy of recognizing China as its first line of defense, there is probably no hope for friendly relations between the United States and Japan. (Reuters, 19th)

### Japanese Parliament Reopens on Tuesday; Military and Political Authorities Met Yesterday to Exchange Views on the Current Situation

Tokyo - After the Diet officially reconvenes on Tuesday, a closed-door meeting will be held. At that time, Prime Minister Konoe, Army Minister Tojo, and Navy Minister Oikawa will secretly report on Japan's preparations in economic and naval and military affairs to cope with the serious international situation. Foreign Minister Matsuoka will present an overview of Japan's foreign relations over the past year at an open meeting. This meeting is the fifth meeting of the Japanese Diet since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, and also the first meeting after the abolition of the Japanese party system. (Reuters, 19th)

Tokyo - Japanese military and political authorities held a meeting today that lasted for two hours. Foreign Minister Matsuoka, Army Minister Tojo, and Navy Minister Yoshida participated. The new ambassador to the United States, Nomura, and the new ambassador to Germany, Oshima, were also invited to attend. They exchanged views on the current situation. (Haitong Telegram, 19th)

Editorial

### Congratulations to Mr. Roosevelt on His Inauguration as President for a Third Term

President Roosevelt was elected to a third consecutive term last winter, and will be sworn in today in Congress. This ceremony, which breaks American historical precedent, is taking place at a time of extreme international turmoil. In addition to expressing our deep congratulations to the United States, we feel immense joy, and we firmly believe that President Roosevelt will be able to further express his ambitions during his next four-year term, and complete his great and immortal mission for the world and humanity.

According to American practice, there are two and a half months between the holding of the general election and the inauguration of the president. This is normally just a short process of transition between the old and the new, with no meaning to speak of. However, in today's desperate fight between aggression and anti-aggression, it has become a time object that both sides must compete for. The winter offensives prepared by the three allied countries in early winter last year were also aimed at the change of American president. However, thanks to the American people's ability to use reason to discern interests, the general election did not give the aggressive countries such an exploitable gap. On the contrary, the US government was able to further develop its established policy more actively because of Roosevelt's re-election. For example, the loan of 100 million yuan to China, the expansion of support for Britain and Greece, the increase of defense facilities in the Philippines and the Pacific, the independent construction of the two-ocean navy, President Roosevelt's fireside chats and congressional messages condemning aggression crimes, and the recent submission and discussion of the Lend-Lease Act, have all been continuously fired at the aggressors like a string of firecrackers during this period, making the aggressive countries feel unprecedentedly overstretched and disadvantaged. For example, France and Spain's refusal to join the Axis, Britain and Greece's great victories on both sides of the Mediterranean, and Japan's hesitation and indecision about advancing south are all directly and indirectly influenced by the firm US foreign policy. And these are all effects of the majority of American voters supporting Roosevelt's re-election. Of course, if the Republican Party had won this time, its future measures might not have differed much from the current policies of the US government. This is especially evident in Willkie's rejection of public opinion and support of Roosevelt's proposal to support China and Britain, which proves that wise men have the same views. However, if Roosevelt had lost, then at least during these two and a half months of transition, not only would there have been no way to prevent the aggressors from making adventurous attempts, but even some of the US's own national defense programs and foreign measures would have been hampered by the change of central leadership. The Japanese army's sudden attack on Shanhaiguan and Rehe at the end of 1932 took advantage of the opportunity of the transition of American heads of state. If this were to be a repeat of history, the upheaval would be even more comparable to Japan's occupation of Rehe and eastern Hebei. Today's various things are not only Roosevelt's success, but also the success of democratic politics.

Roosevelt's reputation and ambitions have undergone a universal and strict test in last winter's election. Although there were restrictions of historical precedent, attacks from enemy party members, and destruction from fifth columns, they did not reduce the American people's support and love for Roosevelt, and finally defeated his political enemies. And in fact, not only in the United States, but also among the talents of the world, Roosevelt is also an outstanding great leader. However, although Roosevelt has achieved these successes, his process of implementing policies is still not enough to cancel out the position adhered to by a small number of isolated individuals: the recent discussions in the US Congress on the Aid Bill are therefore caught in fierce debate. The spirit of holding on to the old and clinging to the outdated by those people can prove that everyone has ample opportunity to express his views under the democratic system, but in a time of crisis and upheaval, excessive adherence to personal prejudices is bound to hinder the smooth implementation of major tasks. Judging from the recent discussions on that bill, there is generally no problem that it will eventually be passed. The dispute is only about the president's authority to execute it and the scope of its application. Recently, Hull, Stimson, and Knox have attended the meetings together, shouting loudly, almost mobilizing the entire lineup of the American central government, and even President Roosevelt himself has had to indirectly engage in defense. This is an unnecessary waste forced by a small number of people. Even the time wasted here inevitably hinders the government's progress in various measures during this time. Our newspaper's editorial yesterday pointed out the possibility of the Axis powers launching an offensive before the American Aid Bill is established. Since the bill was submitted to Congress, the debate has lasted for ten days. Such a major national policy procedure should not be overly hasty, and ten days is not too long, but to be fair, is the spirit of democracy tied to the unnecessary stubbornness of a small number of people? We hope that the US Congress will not repeat the mistakes of causing delays in affairs at a time when the world is looking forward to it. We also sincerely hope that the American people can break various stubborn prejudices with the spirit of breaking historical traditions. All suggestions that limit the president's authority, the advocacy of solely supporting Britain, the fear of war, and the obstruction of transferring warships all contradict the original intention of the majority of American people to support Roosevelt, and should never be allowed to hinder the implementation of the authorities' great policies.

Now, the Far East and Europe are both brewing new turmoil, which will be the first issue that President Roosevelt will encounter after taking office. With his foresight and keen insight, we believe that he will be able to exert unparalleled power and continue and expand the clues that have already begun in the past few months, so that justice can be extended and atrocities can disappear. It is said that President Roosevelt's current physical condition and health are better than before, which is good news for all mankind, and also good news for justice, peace, and order!

### Fierce Fighting Continues Around Yichang; Chinese Army Quite Successful in Preventing Japanese Intrusion; Japanese Army's Southern Offensive in Qixian Repelled by Chinese

Chongqing - According to Chinese sources received here, the military activities that suddenly occurred around Yichang have resulted in fierce fighting, which is still ongoing. The Japanese army seems to have taken the offensive. A few days ago, it sent a team of 5,000 men and more than a dozen aircraft from Longquan Town, east of Yichang, to advance towards Longwangdong and Sanjialing (both transliterated). This Japanese army has been repelled. On January 17, the Japanese army sent a team and more than 20 aircraft to reinforce the attack, and the offensive began again. As a result of the fierce fighting, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses. The battle is still ongoing. (Reuters, 19th)

Zhengzhou - On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese army from Tongxu and Qixian counties gathered a unit, accompanied by 12 tanks and armored vehicles, to invade Nanyuegang, southeast of Tongxu. After Chinese interception, the Japanese suffered many casualties and retreated along the original route. (19th telegram)

Luoyang - On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese army from Fotou and other places southwest of Jincheng invaded Nanling. After the army greeted and attacked, more than a hundred Japanese were killed. (19th telegram)

Nanyang - On the evening of the 9th, the Japanese army that invaded Nanyuan and Zhangdian areas near Luoshan was severely attacked by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese were defeated and retreated. (19th telegram)

### Central Daily News and Sweeping Report Discuss the Dissolution of the New Fourth Army as a Decisive Means to Implement Military Orders; Unrelated to Politics and Other Troops

Chongqing - This morning, the Central Daily News and the Sweeping Report commented on the handling of the New Fourth Army, saying that this was a decisive measure that had to be taken to implement military orders and maintain military discipline, and had nothing to do with politics, and was completely unrelated to other troops. Even in the New Fourth Army, this decision to rebel was only the conspiracy of one or two unscrupulous officers and had nothing to do with all the soldiers. The general public deeply believes that discipline is the guarantee of victory in the War of Resistance, so they all support the authorities' measures. (Havas, 18th)

Chongqing - All newspapers here have published the official announcement of the dissolution of the New Fourth Army in Anhui Province, and all have published this news in an important position. The Social Worker's Newspaper said that from the perspective of unified command and military discipline, this harsh measure is correct. We hope that the Supreme Command will continue to enforce strict discipline in all troops, and other troops should pay attention to this warning. The Central Daily News emphasizes the importance of wartime military discipline, and mentions Han Fuqu and Shi Yousan, who were executed for conspiracy. The newspaper added that Ye Ting has now been arrested, and Xiang Ying will also be hard to escape. This matter seems to have come to an end. This action has nothing to do with politics or other Chinese troops. The entire responsibility rests with Ye Ting and other few people. We deeply appreciate the central government's move, which is fully supported by the people of the country. The Sweeping Report, the mouthpiece of the army, expressed regret for the conspiracy of the New Fourth Army leaders. According to the news of the dissolution of the New Fourth Army, diplomatic figures from various countries had heard about it a few days ago, and originally thought that the opinions of both sides could be resolved without bloodshed, so they were quite disappointed. The Soviet Embassy has been the site of diplomatic activities for the past few days, and it is quite sensitive to the reaction to this unexpected event. The Communist Party's mouthpiece, Xinhua Daily, published two texts written by Zhou Enlai. The first was a notice to commemorate those who died in Jiangnan, and the second was a simple text stating that the New Fourth Army was wrong, but had no intention of rebelling. The newspaper did not publish an editorial or the spokesman of the Military Commission's statement explaining this unexpected event. The government authorities here are certain that the measures taken to deal with the New Fourth Army are purely disciplinary, not political, and have nothing to do with the Communist principles of the army. They also expressed their deep belief that this harsh measure will soon be satisfactorily concluded. (Reuters, 18th)

### Full Text of Hull's Speech (Continued and Completed)

Controlling the Seas, Ensuring Security

Adhering to international law and respecting the freedom of the seas is the way to ensure the security of the Western Hemisphere under the current world situation. If the high seas were controlled by the signatory countries of the Tripartite Pact, the danger to our country would be many times greater than it is today. People often say that the New World is in no danger of aggression, and that the Germans cannot even cross the English Channel, so how could they cross the Atlantic? But if there were no well-equipped Britain, engaged in war every single day to prevent Germany from crossing the English Channel, and if Britain had no precise defense plans to resist a German landing, the Germans could cross the English Channel in an hour. It must be understood that this 20-mile expanse of water between the European continent and Britain is controlled by the British, not by the Germans. If Britain were defeated and lost control of the seas, unless we could do what Britain is currently doing, Germany could cross the Atlantic, especially the South Atlantic. If the Atlantic were controlled by Germany, the Atlantic would no longer provide us with any security. Under such circumstances, to ensure the security of our entire nation, we would need to devote a large part of our efforts and wealth to national defense production, extend universal military service, implement extremely burdensome taxes, maintain constant vigilance on our borders to guard against enemies, and become completely entangled in power diplomacy. If such were the case, all of the above would become necessary. Today, Britain is a true fortress, and when America's armed defense preparations are complete, America will be as well. But in fact, it seems that an ideal aggressor would not adopt a direct frontal attack to conquer America. If such people have an opportunity to invade, we dare say that the aggressor would first invade other countries in the Western Hemisphere that are more vulnerable than America, and then invade America. Destructive forces are currently at work in many American countries, striving to create international disputes and divisions. Such actions are now well-known as the prelude to armed aggression. These forces are now being sanctioned and actively eliminated. However, if control of the high seas falls into the hands of an ideal attacker, the entire situation will change. Under such circumstances, due to the difficulty of continental defense, the effort we expend will be greater than we want to use at this time. The most serious problem facing the United States today is whether the United States will allow control of the high seas to fall into the hands of countries that only seek unlimited conquest. Therefore, we should today correct our concepts and actions regarding the issue of preparing material assistance for Britain.

Material Assistance to Invaded Countries

The public policy issue that is today most unanimously valued and emphasized by the people of our country is none other than the issue of giving the greatest possible material assistance to Britain and other invaded countries within the shortest possible period of time, for our own most important interests. The reason for this is that it is now completely obvious that resisting the aggressor with this assistance is the most important part of our self-defense. At a time when aggressive forces are rampant in the world, if we want to determine a wise and prudent national policy, we must consider self-defense. If we do not provide assistance to the invaded, the result will not be to restore peace, but only to permanently enslave the already invaded countries, and give the aggressor the opportunity to gather strength to attack us. The leaders of the armies we are now confronting with the tools of self-defense have fundamentally abandoned the long-standing peaceful and orderly international relations. They disregard all the rights of neutral countries, even the rights they have personally and solemnly guaranteed not to violate. The tools they often use to rule their unfortunate victims are unreasonable terror, killing, fraud, forced labor, confiscation of property, concentration camps, and various other forms of exploitation. Peaceful countries today have much confidence in the concept of law, protection, and many well-intentioned, law-abiding countries have been destroyed. I am certain that a day will come when countries that themselves despise and disregard the principles of the rule of law will have no opportunity to demand that the countries they want to harm strictly abide by those principles, until the enemy is at the gates of the city. But as long as such countries exist, we must not change our determination due to their threats or protests, but must at any time create various methods and conditions necessary for our own security and self-defense. The current bill will establish an institution that will enable us to most effectively use our resources for our own needs and the needs of those we decide to assist for self-defense. The biggest problem with democracy is to quickly and completely organize and use its power. The bill now proposed is a necessary way to achieve this goal. This bill will enable us to allocate our resources in the most well-calculated way, in order to ensure the safety of the United States and the Americas in the face of the many dangers that lie ahead. Most importantly, it will enable us to accomplish everything in the fastest way. Speed is what we need most today.

Citing Treaties, Answering Inquiries

After the presentation was completed, someone asked Hull how the bill would affect domestic and international law? Hull replied by citing various treaties and laws as follows: (1) The Johnson Act. This law seems unlikely to be affected, as it does not apply to the U.S. government or public corporations established under special authorization from Congress, or companies in which the U.S. government holds significant interests, such as the Export-Import Bank. (2) The Public Law of 1939. Section 7 of this law prohibits loans or credit to belligerent countries, but according to its wording, it does not apply to the U.S. government, but it may apply to companies such as the Export-Import Bank. In any case, this provision will be replaced by the new law regarding the actions of the U.S. government. (2) Section 23 of Title 18 of the Federal Code prohibits ships in the United States from being armed for use by a belligerent country against a country or nation with which the United States is not at war. Section 24 of this law prohibits warships or armed vessels of belligerent countries from increasing or building up their military strength in U.S. ports. Section 33 of this law prohibits the surrender of any military vessel from the United States to a belligerent country during a war in which the United States remains neutral. The above provisions will be replaced by the new law. The Hague Convention of 1907, the 13th Hague Convention of 1907, stipulates in Article 6 that neutral countries are prohibited from directly or indirectly supplying belligerent countries with warships, ordnance or military materials in any way. Article 17 stipulates that warships of belligerent countries may carry out repairs necessary for navigation in neutral ports, but may not increase their combat power in any way. Article 18 stipulates that warships of belligerent countries may not use neutral ports to replenish or increase their military materials or weapons. This convention cannot be applied to the current European war, because Article 28 stipulates, "This convention shall not apply except between contracting powers, and then only if all the belligerents are parties to the convention." Britain and Italy did not participate in this convention, or it is said that the Federal Code and the Hague Convention cited above state the principles of international law regarding the above question. If we do the things imagined by the new law, we will destroy neutrality. This view is largely correct under normal circumstances, but what we are dealing with is not an ordinary situation, but an extraordinary situation.

Neutrality is a Mistake

The rules regarding the rights and obligations of neutral countries, and the rules regarding the rights and obligations of belligerent countries, are reciprocal, that is, the so-called belligerent countries must not engage in certain acts that infringe on the rights of neutral countries, and neutral countries must not engage in certain acts that impede the rights of belligerent countries. For example, Article 1 of the Hague Convention stipulates that belligerent countries must respect the sovereignty of neutral countries, and must not engage in any act within the territory or territorial waters of neutral countries that would constitute a violation of neutrality. Belligerent countries must also not use neutral seaports and territorial waters as bases for warships and submarines to fight against enemies (Article 5). Germany and Italy do not pay attention to these provisions that represent international law, and arbitrarily occupy the territories of neutral countries by force without notice, and after conquering these countries, they use the resources of these conquered countries to attack hostile countries. One of these countries, such as Belgium, concluded a formal treaty with Germany on May 1, 1939, in which both parties agreed never to resort to force in any event. And Norway, like Norway, obtained a guarantee from the German government on September 1, 1939, which stated that Germany would never violate Norway's inviolability and political integrity, and that Germany would respect Norway's territorial integrity. These agreements or neutral laws cannot serve as a guarantee for Norway, Belgium and other countries, but provide belligerent countries with the convenience of invading their land. Apart from force, there is no other way to stop these belligerent countries from conquering other countries by means of aggression. The purpose of these belligerent countries to conquer the world has already been boldly declared. These people have already acknowledged that their philosophy is contrary to the philosophy of democratic countries, and firmly believe that democracy is outdated and must be replaced by these people to fulfill their requirements for organizing international relations. We feel in our hearts that certain facts have occurred, and are continuing to occur, and are continuing to occur before our eyes. If we continue to use neutral laws as the standard, or feel that neutral laws can give us a minimum of security or guarantee, it is a waste of effort. Only by paying attention to the actual concepts of the current situation can we have a sound concept. Therefore, the question of neutrality, I have made it clear, becomes an illusion once it is obstructed by ambitious aggressors. Apart from the question of neutrality, there is a recognized principle that is older than any neutral law, that is, the right of a country to defend itself against threats from within and without. This is an element of national sovereignty, and is also recognized by the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. We may be able to learn that these aggressors have no intention of invading the Western Hemisphere, but some countries that have been occupied by force by these people have been given guarantees by the aggressors. These guarantees are all empty words. Therefore, we cannot rely on these guarantees to delay the completion of our national defense until we can determine what the actual psychology of these aggressors is. Some conquered countries and other unconquered countries all have territories in the Western Hemisphere. Should we not assume that if circumstances permit, these territories could be occupied by these aggressor countries, or be used as bases by these aggressor countries to complete their attempts to conquer the world? We are fully aware that it is legitimate to supply military supplies to countries that are directly defending themselves and indirectly defending us against the invasion of those who are determined to conquer other countries by force. We are now only trying to defend ourselves against a situation that we did not create. What we are doing our best to do is to prevent this situation from happening. (United Press)

### Japan Pays Heavy Price for War of Aggression Against China: Overseas Trade Plummets, Gold Flows Out, Treasury Exhausted

Washington, D.C. According to neutral economists and international affairs experts speaking to a United Press reporter, Japan has paid a heavy price in terms of gold and losses in trade and shipping for its war in China. If the war in the Far East continues for a long time, there may be continuous and significant sacrifices. Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in July 1937, the amount of gold worth US$700,000,000 flowing into the United States from Japan is only one indication of this price. Japan's alliance with the Axis powers has not only failed to reduce its economic burden, but has increased it, because neither Germany nor Italy can maintain a "supply and demand" commercial relationship with this Far Eastern empire, while this Far Eastern empire can provide Germany and Italy with economic assistance in terms of goods or services. Japan has stopped publishing international trade statistics for various countries, perhaps due to military reasons. The overall report of its trade with the mainland can reportedly only be obtained upon special request. Its total amount of monetary reserves was once reported to be 501,000,000 yen. It is widely believed that this is a superficial figure, because part of this amount may have been allocated for domestic affairs. Because there is no count or index of international economic activity to observe, it is difficult to guess how Japan can afford the cost of the war on the Asian continent. Most of Japan's exports must be exported to countries in the so-called yen bloc, and most of Japan's required imports must come from countries outside the yen bloc. This is a definite fact. Japan's abandonment of many sea voyages and transportation in order to carry out its necessary military transportation is also an indirect factor in its significant losses. As a result, Japan had to replace imported goods with domestic goods to the extent possible, and cause the standard of living to generally decline. How long can this situation in Japan last? It will likely depend on its ability to requisition its manpower and financial resources, its ability to organize new industries, and the extent to which it can expand trade to countries where there is no foreign exchange problem. Official statistics in the United States have shown some indicators, although not very accurate, are sufficient to know the terrible economic price that Japan has paid for building its New Order in East Asia. In 1935, Japan's foreign trade reached a high level throughout the year, and its industrial production also reached its peak that year. At that time, Japan purchased raw materials from foreign markets at extremely low prices, produced them at low wages, and used its own shipping to actively move towards the status of an industrially self-sufficient and international commercial country, while the United States at that time was a good market for Japan's silk and manufactured goods. Less than two years later, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred in July 1937. Since then, Japan has purchased countless industrial raw materials and equipment for military purposes, and most of its regular economy has also become to meet the needs of the war. As a result, Japan felt a great deficit in its trade balance with the United States. As a result, a large amount of Japan's gold flowed into the United States. In 1937, the gold flowing into the United States from Japan, calculated at US$35 per ounce of pure gold, totaled US$346,500,000. In 1938, the gold flowing into the United States was worth a total of US$168,700,000. In 1939, the gold flowing into the United States was worth US$169,600,000. In the first eleven months of 1940, the total value of gold flowing into the United States was US$98,400,000. There may be more flowing in the future, because commercial statistics still show that a large amount of American goods are being shipped to Japan, exceeding the amount purchased from Japan. In the first ten months of 1940, the goods shipped from the United States to Japan were worth US$191,413,000, compared to US$179,377,000 in the same period in 1939. This year, the number of American wood fiber raw materials, petroleum, iron blocks, steel, copper, and metal machinery purchased by Japan has increased significantly. In the first ten months of 1940, the goods imported from Japan by the United States were worth US$122,667,000, compared to US$125,312,000 in the previous year. (United Press Dispatch, 19th)

### The Painful History of the European War (8): Recollections of the Disorganized Anglo-French Front

The goal of terrifying civilians through the shelling of Sui-Ji was surprisingly successful. Later, I discovered that in every village, there was a plainclothes agent of German or Belgian origin. As soon as a bomb landed, they would tell people: "Escape while you still can! The village will be razed to the ground, and the German secret police will follow the German planes here. You know how they treat the Poles!"

The residents, believing these falsehoods, fled en masse, including the village head, priests, officials, and ordinary people. The refugees along the road resembled a surging tide, a truly grand spectacle. First came the cars of the wealthy, the chauffeurs wearing gloves and fashionable hats; then the middle class, driving their own cars with bedding tied to the roofs; followed by horse-drawn carts carrying entire families; and finally, groups of pedestrians and cyclists.

No contagion spreads more easily than panic during an evacuation. As the wave of people near the French border passed through each village and town, the residents of those places joined the exodus. Our excellent mechanized units had to struggle to weave their way through the human tide on the first day.

However, there had never been such chaos in the 1914 war, not even when the Amiens front was breached. Why? Because today's terror is far greater than in 1914; because someone is deliberately spreading rumors that penetrate deeply into people's minds, so that even a patriotic person who forgets their family will abandon everything to escape this immense danger; because most farmers were poorly informed in 1914 and remained ignorant, but now they are awakened by the alarming news announced on the radio; and because the German air force has an absolute numerical advantage, making them believe they are completely defenseless.

To prevent them from fleeing, the military and political authorities would need immense resolve to forbid anyone from abandoning their homes and to position machine guns on rooftops to show a defensive posture. Moreover, only sending more fighter planes to patrol the skies over Belgium could stop these people and force them to stay put. Unfortunately, the authorities themselves were swept along by the tide, and there were no machine guns or planes to be seen. Everyone was enveloped in terror and had no avenue for appeal, so they fled aimlessly and without order.

This unprecedented chaos not only made it impossible to execute orders, but also brought misfortune, as the orders were never issued in time. The commander-in-chief and fifteen generals were summarily dismissed. General Weygand came from Syria, far away, but was delayed by wind and rain en route. General Billotte, commanding the northern forces, although facing a formidable enemy, was both courageous and insightful, and tried to hold the line. Unfortunately, he died in a car accident at the critical moment. His successor, General Blanchard, was no less capable than Billotte, but because he took over so hastily, he lacked coordination with his troops and had to command the battle in the most unfavorable circumstances.

As the saying goes, "Good fortune never comes in pairs, but misfortune never comes alone." A series of accidents and failures followed one after another, creating such a massive disaster that every time one thinks of it, one must consider the god of fate, sighing at the cruelty of creation when unexpected tragedies occur.

I was in the British General Staff when they received news that the Germans had broken through at Sedan and that Corap's army had collapsed. However, the British side concealed this information for two days, whether out of caution or cowardice, I do not know. The war reports were still carefully worded and vague, but I could easily see that something was being hidden. They immediately stopped talking when they saw me enter the room. Orders for retreat had also been issued. Only at the very end did the British side tell me what they knew.

The German breakthrough of our lines was swift and thorough, a result of concentrated attacks, surprise, and terror tactics. Thousands of flamethrower tanks and thousands of strangely noisy planes surrounded and attacked Corap's army. Even the bravest men would find it difficult to hold their ground in the face of such an unexpected and unprepared assault.

The most powerful German tanks had thick armor that could not be penetrated by artillery shells, which dismayed the French soldiers. The steel plates made by the Škoda armaments factory were exceptionally strong. Hitting them with our artillery shells was like a dragonfly trying to shake a stone pillar; there was no hope of damaging them. The French artillery was clever enough to discover that their 75mm guns could be used as direct-fire guns if handled properly, but this was only a temporary expedient, not an organized defense method.

In mid-May, the French were asking each other, "How did the Germans cross the Meuse River? Were there no mines buried under the bridges?" At the time, rumors were circulating in the British army that German paratroopers and spies had shot the soldiers responsible for blowing up the bridges, and that the number of mines buried was insufficient. Moreover, the German mechanized units received great help from plainclothes agents when they passed through the Ardennes Forest, which allowed them to advance at a terrifying speed, catching Corap's army by surprise.

A tragic and moving event unfolded on the Meuse River. British and French pilots were ordered to sacrifice themselves to destroy the designated bridges. One squadron each of British and French bombers volunteered to give their lives for their country. The French planes went first, flying lower, followed by the British planes. I never received a report on the number of French losses, but I know that of the sixty British planes, forty were missing.

There are countless other similar stories, showing that the Allied forces were not without courage. It is a great fallacy to say that the Allied forces were demoralized and incapable of fighting from the beginning of the war. But like microorganisms, they are ineffective against a healthy body, but if the body is weakened by fatigue and worry, the microorganisms will seize the opportunity to wreak havoc. The morale of the Allied forces was not very strong to begin with, and once they saw that their equipment was inadequate, they inevitably declined rapidly.

After the defeat at Sedan, the belief that the enemy would win spread everywhere, and retreating troops used this as an excuse. The news of the enemy's mechanized units arriving preceded their actual arrival, clearing the way for them. After the enemy broke through at Sedan, they turned west to attack the Allied forces in the north. At the time, I was in the British General Staff, which moved to Arras to avoid being surrounded. Arras was filled with rumors: "The Germans are already at such-and-such a place..." These rumors, of course, were later proven true, but at the time they were just rumors. However, one person told ten, and ten told a hundred, and in an instant, men, women, old, and young fled in panic. Even the military authorities were alarmed and suspicious, ordering their troops to retreat to the coast, where they were eventually captured by the enemy.

It is true that German paratroopers were active in the Netherlands and Belgium, but the terrifying rumors only served to enhance the enemy's prestige and increase their effectiveness tenfold. Farmers and soldiers suspected everyone of being disguised. Priests were no longer believed to be real priests, and even uniformed officers were suspected of being impostors. Telephones and telegrams were all regarded with suspicion.

These fantastic rumors spread even faster than the German Messerschmitt fighters. This explains why small enemy units were able to occupy important towns without bloodshed. A small number of well-equipped and courageous mechanized units would often rush into train stations, kill a few station staff, and disrupt train traffic. In reality, these station staff were capable of defending themselves and were obligated to do so. I once met a group of British engineers wielding shovels and axes who slaughtered the members of the enemy's motorcycle reconnaissance team, leaving no one alive.

The defense of Arras by the Welsh infantry and a small number of French light infantry also served as a model for covering operations. I saw these soldiers, assisted by the French officer Premier, calmly set up defensive lines. The entrances to the city were barricaded with barbed wire, sandbags, and machine guns and direct-fire guns were placed in ambush. When German tanks came, they destroyed several of them, and the rest caught fire. The enemy was blocked and could not find a gap to exploit around the city. The brave and effective defense of the city lasted for a week, before finally retreating to Dunkirk.

If this kind of excellence could be found in all armies, General Weygand would have been able to launch a counterattack, close the gap between Arras and Bapaume, and cut off the German rear. Unfortunately, the public was fleeing in panic, order was chaotic, reserves were lacking, transportation routes were destroyed, and the Allied General Staff collapsed due to enemy air activity. Even if there had been brilliant plans, they could not be implemented and ultimately came to naught. The speed with which German spies obtained information was truly mysterious and unbelievable. When a commanding general arrived in a village, enemy planes would often come to bomb before he had even settled in. (To be continued)

### German Troops Concentrate in the Balkans to Prevent a New British Offensive; No Incidents Expected Soon; Turkish Government Prepares for Air Defense

Istanbul: The Akşam newspaper here reports that the German troop concentration in the Balkans aims to prevent British forces from transferring large sea, land, and air units from North Africa to Salonica in Greece. Germany believes that if Italy is defeated in Libya, the British will open a new front against Germany in the Balkans. Therefore, the German troops are merely preventing the collapse of Italy and a new British offensive, not any changes regarding the Soviet Union, nor purely to aid Italy, as it is too late for that. (United Press dispatch, 19th)

Budapest: Balkan observers believe that there will be no special activity in the Balkans for at least several weeks. Their belief is based on climatic conditions (yesterday's electrical storm was intense). Secondly, the Balkans are merely one of the European theaters. Hungarian newspapers yesterday prominently published the news that the British sweeper HMS Sambourne was sunk near Sicily by a German ship, and emphasized that the German army had an important air base in the south. (United Press dispatch, 19th)

Istanbul: News here today is that the Turkish government is currently preparing a law that will allow the government to requisition all wooden houses. The purpose of this law is to prevent air raids, but it is not known whether the Turkish government will demolish the houses due to their flammability, or merely evacuate the residents. (United Press dispatch, 19th)

Bern, Switzerland: Diplomatic sources report that Hitler and Mussolini had important talks over the weekend, and considerable large-scale German-Italian actions are expected to arise from these. It is reported that senior officials of both also participated in the meeting. The main issue discussed was the joint Axis actions in the Mediterranean. It is also reported that the two have agreed on a more definite attitude towards the US proposal for "full" aid to Britain. The French issue is also said to be on the agenda. Observers believe that the meeting, held on the eve of President Roosevelt's inauguration, is undoubtedly of great significance. Diplomatic observers predict that Germany and Italy will quickly put pressure on France, with the aim of obtaining French naval bases and warships for Axis use. As for the possibility of attacking Gibraltar via Spain, attacking Greece from the Balkans, or even starting a war with Turkey, these may also materialize in the near future. (International News Service dispatch, 19th)

### North African Dust Storms Hinder Fighting; British Air Force Attacks Italian Bases; Italian Bombers Strike Suez Canal Area

Cairo: It was announced here today that just as strong winds and dust storms have brought land fighting to a standstill, British air force bombers have again launched destructive attacks on the Italian port of Tobruk and other Italian bases in North Africa, causing heavy losses. It is claimed that the British bomber groups flew to their destinations against adverse winds and air currents, launching a long attack on Tobruk, causing two major fires and eleven explosions. Other bombers reportedly raided the heavily defended Italian coastal base of Derna, "with large numbers of bombs hitting army barracks." (International News Service dispatch, 19th)

Cairo: An RAF communique states that on Thursday night, British planes bombed Tobruk, causing two major fires and ten major explosions in the town. That night, they also bombed the airfields of Derna, Martuba, and Rhodes, the Caproni factory in Madagascar, the motor vehicle depot in Assab, a transport ship near Bardia, and the artillery positions in Solum. Italian planes dropped several bombs in the Alexandria and Suez Canal areas on Friday, but damage was minimal and there were no casualties. Also on Thursday night, they raided a British air force camp in Sidi Haneish, dropping many bombs, but there was no major damage. (United Press dispatch, 19th)

Cairo: The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior issued a communique yesterday stating that enemy planes flew to the Suez Canal area at midnight on Friday, dropping a few bombs, causing no damage to life or property. Another communique stated that enemy planes also approached the Alexandria area late on Friday, but there was no damage to life or property. (Reuters and Xinhua dispatch, 19th)

Rome: An Italian communique states that in East Africa, Italian planes bombed British bases in Upper Sudan, the Aroma railway station, and troops and armored units in the Maughers area. The Italian bases of Massawa and Assab were attacked by British planes. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

### Greek Troops Continue to Advance in Albania; Greeks Sink Italian Troop Transport

Athens: According to an official spokesman here, Greek troops continued to advance on the central sector of the Albanian front, occupying important heights and capturing large quantities of military supplies. There were also patrol activities in other areas, and many Italian soldiers were captured. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

London: A Reuters special correspondent reports from the Albanian border that after fierce fighting around Moschopolis in the central sector of the Albanian front, Greek troops have occupied several high points in the Ostravicë mountain range, but their advance has now been checked by Italian troops. There is artillery fire in the Devolli River valley, but no troop movements on either side. In the Qesarakë River valley, Greek troops advanced briefly but were forced to retreat to their original positions by an Italian counterattack. Fighting is continuing in this area. Greek patrols now control the area around Lin on the shores of Lake Ohrid. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Athens: Greek sources announce that on Friday, Greek troops charged into Italian positions, surrounded Italian troops, and captured 1,000 soldiers from the famous "Lupi di Toscana" division. It is also claimed by Italian prisoners that the Italian transport ships Lombardia (20,000 tons) and Liguria (15,354 tons), loaded with reinforcements, were torpedoed in the Adriatic Sea. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Athens: The Greek Navy Department implied last night that the Greek submarine Proteus, which sank an Italian troop transport in the Adriatic Sea 21 days ago, has been lost. An official statement said that the submarine, weighing 700 tons and carrying 41 officers and men, has not returned to its base since sinking the Italian ship. (International News Service dispatch, 19th)

Rome: The Italian High Command announced that heavy snow on the Greek front is hindering military activities. (Transocean News Service dispatch, 19th)

### Malta Attacked Again

Malta: During a German air raid here on Saturday afternoon, five dive bombers were damaged. According to an official statement, all five planes were shot down by British fighters. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Berlin: German dive bombers and ordinary bombers, escorted by German and Italian fighters, flew to Malta yesterday to bomb it for several hours. Hangars, barracks, and warehouses everywhere were bombed and destroyed, with fires breaking out in many places. In the ensuing air battle, one British Hurricane fighter was shot down. Two German planes did not return to their bases. (Transocean News Service dispatch, 19th)

Berlin: German authorities have declared that German planes lost one plane each in attacks on British fleets in the Mediterranean and on Malta. British claims of shooting down 12 and 10 German planes respectively are utterly unfounded. (Transocean News Service dispatch, 19th)

### British Planes Have Raided Germany 900 Times Since the Start of the European War; Industrial Areas and Ports Have Been Heavily Bombed; Germany Also Shells British Escort Convoy

London: A Reuters aviation correspondent reports that the British bombing of German military targets continues unabated. Though the weather is unfavorable for flying, the scope of British air raids this winter has not diminished. According to records released by the Ministry of Information yesterday, British planes raided Germany a total of 900 times from the start of the war to the end of summer. Of these, 700 raids were carried out in the three months of July, August, and September. In the three months from early October to New Year's Day, British planes carried out a total of 500 raids. In the most recent three months, the weather has often limited British planes to bombing German-occupied territories. On January 1 this year, British planes carried out their first daylight raid on the Krupp factory in Cologne. Judging from specially prepared maps, the bombing by British planes was very accurate. In the last quarter of last year, the Ruhr industrial area suffered many air raids. Although the Germans have made every effort to relocate factories in the Ruhr area to the east, the Ruhr remains the center of German war production, with the town of Essen, where the Krupp factory is located, being the most important, followed by the Mannheim and Leipzig areas. All of these areas, which produce the most German military equipment, have been bombed by British planes, with thousands of tons of bombs dropped. Most of the aviation fuel used by the German air force and the machine oil used by German submarines are produced in the Leipzig area. It is estimated that nine-tenths of Germany's oil production has been attacked by British planes. According to statistics, 270 German cities and towns have been attacked. Among them, the hardest hit are the shipping areas of northern Germany. The two largest German ports, Hamburg and Bremen, have each been raided 61 times and 52 times respectively as of January 4. The naval bases of Kiel and Wilhelmshaven and Emden have also been raided 30 to 40 times. Bremen, Germany's best base for submarines and aircraft, was attacked three nights in a row during the first week of this year. British planes have raided Berlin 35 times, but British planes have not attacked since the night of December 20. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

London: Last night, German bombers did not appear over the British Isles, possibly due to winter gales in the English Channel. However, Nazi artillery heavily shelled Dover this morning. As the British retaliated, the German shelling gradually subsided. The artillery battle followed a brief daylight raid on London. Rescue workers in Swansea are taking advantage of a brief lull to rescue victims from the ruins of the fire-bombing blitz on Friday night. The British Isles have also begun to convene more commanders to discuss defense, to conscript service personnel, and to prevent communist activity. Yesterday, King George signed the first Privy Council order in British history, making compulsory defense service for men aged 16 to 60. Home Secretary Morrison said that the order is currently intended to make them serve in extinguishing incendiary bombs. It is claimed that British women will soon be forced to perform this service as well. Everyone will be forced to guard against fire for 48 hours each month, especially in commercial organizations and factories. Those who desert will be severely punished. It is understood that Minister of Labour Bevin has completed drafting a secret plan to utilize nationwide compulsory service. The plan will be announced on Tuesday. It is also understood that the plan will include fine-tuning dock workers, etc., and concentrating efforts to meet escort convoys and immediately unload goods. It is hinted that this construction project will be nationalized. (International News Service dispatch, 19th)

London: The British Air Ministry revealed last night that the British Air Force recently launched another daylight bombing of German ships in the English Channel. One German ship was sunk, and three others were hit by bombs. (International News Service dispatch, 19th)

Berlin: It has just been learned from authoritative sources that German long-range artillery shelled a British escort convoy near Dover port from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. yesterday. (Transocean News Service dispatch, 19th)

### Two British Minesweeping Fishing Vessels Lost; No Casualties Among Crew

A British Admiralty communiqué states that the British naval minesweeping fishing vessels HMS Chestnut and HMS Expectation have both been lost. There were no casualties among the crews of either ship. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

### German-Italian Economic Talks to Be Held in Rome; German Delegation Scheduled to Arrive in Italy

Rome: It has been officially announced that Germany and Italy will hold an important meeting tomorrow to discuss all issues related to economic relations. (United Press dispatch, 19th) Rome: German-Italian economic talks will begin in Rome early next week and are expected to last about two weeks. Dr. Clodius, a cabinet member of the German Department of Unconcern, will arrive here on Sunday with 35 experts. Although the holding of these talks is nothing out of the ordinary for the regular meetings between Germany and Italy, responsible sources here say that no meeting has been as important as this one since the establishment of the February 1940 commercial agreement. The topics to be discussed include transportation issues and the relations between the Axis powers and the occupied territories. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

### Liu Dajun and Economics

— Zhu Tongjiu

(1) Purpose of Drafting this Article

Mr. Zhang Yifan telegraphed, requesting that I write an article rich in suggestions for the "Shen Bao" Economics Special Issue. Without thinking, I immediately agreed. However, after careful consideration, drafting an article is easy, but writing one that is full of suggestions is as difficult as climbing to the heavens. If I were to write carelessly, I fear it would disgrace the reputation of the publication. So, I reviewed the recently published articles in the "Shen Bao" Economics Special Issue. Most of them discussed economic systems or economic problems, while articles reviewing economics itself were as rare as morning stars. I surmise that due to the rising cost of living in Shanghai recently, writers are focusing all their efforts on immediate life problems in order to cope with the environment. They have no time to attend to economics that is abstract in principle. This is probably a natural trend and nothing to be surprised about. However, while racking my brains, I suddenly remembered Liu Dajun, one of the two leading economic figures in our country. He dedicated his life to economics, initiated and organized the Chinese Economic Society, and encouraged young scholars to engage in in-depth research on economics. His contributions to the progress of economics in our country resonated with those of Mr. Ma Yinchu. This year marks his 50th birthday. I am taking this opportunity to use the space of the Economics Special Issue to describe the relationship between Mr. Liu Dajun and economics, and to promote the historical facts of the progress of economics in our country. This is something that the Economics Special Issue should disclose. Mr. Liu Dajun has studied economics all his life and has always advised government authorities on how to develop our national economy. This also fits with what Mr. Yifan called being rich in suggestions. It is a win-win situation and feels very appropriate. Therefore, this article can be regarded as a congratulatory message for Mr. Liu Dajun's birthday, or as an article full of suggestions.

(2) Brief Biography and Works of Mr. Liu Dajun

Mr. Liu Dajun's high position in the academic world is well known to all domestic researchers of economics and statistics. Even foreign researchers in the United States and Britain who study the Chinese economy invariably cite the figures disclosed in his works as supporting evidence for their arguments. However, when discussing economic authorities, other sectors in the country often praise Mr. Ma Yinchu. But fewer people are familiar with Mr. Liu Dajun. After examining the reasons for this, there are two points to consider: First, most of Mr. Liu Dajun's works are written in English, while most of Mr. Ma Yinchu's works are published in Chinese. Therefore, Chinese people read more of Ma's works because of the language. Second, Mr. Liu Dajun spends most of his time organizing statistical figures and presiding over survey work. There are fewer public speeches to the public. Mr. Ma Yinchu, on the other hand, has been giving public speeches everywhere in the past ten years, and has had more opportunities to meet with the public. Now, in order to familiarize all sectors with Mr. Liu's contributions to the academic world, Mr. Liu's brief biography and works are described as follows:

Mr. Liu Dajun studied engineering at the University of Michigan in the United States. Later, he majored in economics and became a prominent student of the famous American economist Professor Dayler. After returning to China, he first taught at Tsinghua University. Currently, the well-known domestic economists Xiao Ju, Chen Zong, and Li Quanshi, etc., once received their blessings from his rostrum. Later, he assisted Mr. Turner in presiding over the Beijing Economic Discussion Office to conduct surveys on the economic situation in various parts of China, and compiled various economic statistics, and published two kinds of Chinese and Western economic publications. The work of economic survey in our country began with this. Therefore, Mr. Liu is worthy of being called the pioneer of economic survey work in our country. Later, Mr. Liu also invited Professor Dairen of Yenching University, as well as the well-known economists Chen Changheng, Wei Tingsheng, Chen Da, and Ma Yinchu to organize the Chinese Economic Society. All the members elected Mr. Liu as the president, and he spared no effort in promoting the study of economics and conducting economic surveys. He made great contributions to making the people of the country pay significant attention to economic undertakings. After the success of the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, Hu Hanmin, the president of the Legislative Yuan, admired Mr. Liu's reputation and hired Mr. Liu as the director of the Statistics Department of the Legislative Yuan. Later, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics was established, and he served as the director of the Bureau of Statistics, planning the promotion of national statistical work. He planned carefully. During this period, in order to promote the interest of the Chinese people in the study of statistics, Mr. Liu also initiated the organization of the Chinese Statistical Society, and Mr. Liu was also elected as the president. Therefore, the current considerable achievements in statistical work in our country seem to be attributed to Mr. Liu's promotion. After Mr. Liu was re-appointed to go abroad to investigate the world's statistical undertakings, he realized that the relationship between economics and statistics was very close. Therefore, he initiated the joint establishment of the Chinese Economic Statistics Research Institute by the Chinese Economic Society and the Chinese Statistical Society. Both societies unanimously elected Mr. Liu as the director of the institute. Not long after the establishment of the institute, the government entrusted the institute to investigate the national industry. After more than two years, the national industrial survey was completed, and three volumes of the "Chinese Industrial Survey Report" were compiled, which is the greatest of our country's survey work and is often admired by the academic community. Before the war, Mr. Liu was also entrusted by the central government to plan and promote the National Economic Construction Movement, and made great contributions. Even the four slogans of the National Economic Construction Movement: "Everyone uses their talents, the land uses its benefits, everything uses its use, and goods flow freely," were written by Mr. Liu. Currently, Mr. Liu is the director of the National Economic Research Institute, studying planned economies.

As for Mr. Liu's published works in recent years, the important ones include the following books:

(3) Mr. Liu Dajun's Scholarship

Mr. Liu Dajun's method of studying economics is roughly the same as the quantitative analysis method adopted by Professor Mitchell of Columbia University in the United States. However, the statistical undertaking in the United States has already been developed. Various economic statistics have been compiled by the government or private organizations. Professor Mitchell can engage in analysis after collecting the various economic statistics he needs. However, the statistical undertaking in our country remains to be developed. Therefore, before starting research, Mr. Liu must also take on the task of land reclamation, and first engage in economic survey matters. Therefore, although Mr. Liu's method of scholarship is roughly the same as that of Professor Mitchell, the difficulties Mr. Liu encounters are far greater than those felt by Professor Mitchell. In view of this, Mr. Liu is especially cautious in the use of mathematics, in the hope that what he discusses will be in line with the facts and helpful to practical use. Economics is the study of managing the world and benefiting the people. All suggestions and advocacy are closely related to the national economy. If the cited figures are not in line with the facts, it will not only make people doubt the effectiveness of statistics, but also greatly reduce the applicability of economics. In addition to carefully citing figures, Mr. Liu also reads widely, analyzes foreign regulations, examines domestic facts, weighs the situation and considers the reasons, and studies repeatedly before deciding on countermeasures and writing discussions. Therefore, Mr. Liu's spirit of scholarship can be described as meticulous and pragmatic, which is far from those who engage in the practice with the attitude of "though not exact, it's not far off."

(4) Mr. Liu Dajun's Contribution to Economics in Our Country

If we observe the theoretical aspect of economics in our country at present, the theory of economics in our country is still in the stage of importing and imitating. The date of difficult creation is still quite distant. Therefore, most of the contributions of well-known economists in our country in recent years have been the work of importing foreign goods. Mr. Liu Dajun cannot escape this exception. Although Mr. Liu has not created new theories to benefit the people of the country, he has engaged in economic survey work and compiled economic statistics, as well as encouraged later generations to work hard on in-depth research. His contribution to promoting the progress of economics in recent years in the state of land reclamation cannot be ignored. Now, Mr. Liu's contributions to economics are described as follows:

(1) Engaging in survey work to supply "domestic" economic data. Mr. Li Quanshi advocated the compilation of national textbooks to replace imported goods. The intention was good and was admired by the people of the time. However, most of the raw materials used by Mr. Li in compiling domestic textbooks were still imported. Mr. Liu Dajun's job is exactly the opposite of Mr. Li's: advocating the survey of the economic situation in various parts of our country, compiling survey materials for the study of "domestic" economics. Therefore, Mr. Liu's first contribution to economics is to supply "domestic" economic data by starting with survey methods, so that those who aspire to compile "domestic" textbooks in the future can use them.

(2) Compiling "domestic" statistics with "domestic" materials. Mr. Liu's compilation of "domestic" statistics with the figures obtained from the survey, so that the people of the country can understand the economic dynamics of their own country, is one of Mr. Liu's contributions to the society. However, after Mr. Liu published the various "domestic" statistical figures he compiled, they can not only be used by foreign economists as a basis for studying the economic changes in our country, but also enable domestic economists to use their figures to prove whether the economic theories imported from foreign countries are applicable in our country. This is Mr. Liu's second contribution to economics.

(3) Adopting quantitative analysis methods to study economics. Twenty years ago, Mr. Yang Xingfu wrote an article with fragmented figures and published it in the "Eastern Magazine." The elder Wu Zhihui praised it as a rare and hard-to-come-by masterpiece. However, Mr. Liu went a step further than Mr. Yang. In addition to directly investigating the economic situation and compiling economic statistics, he also used the figures obtained from the survey to engage in analysis in order to understand the cause and effect of its changes, and to use it as a compass for future improvement. This is Mr. Liu's third contribution to economics.

(4) Forward-thinking as a guide for young economists. Mr. Liu's method of scholarship is different from those who rely on subjective fantasy. His thinking is also very forward-looking and often serves as a guide for young economists. Mr. Liu has read all the famous economic works in the world. He also diligently reads the newly published magazines at home and abroad. Therefore, Mr. Liu has a clear understanding of the trends in the world's economic thought. As for what Mr. Liu is most interested in in economics, it is currency and finance and industrial construction. Therefore, in the past, when administrative authorities or legislative authorities made decisions on the above two policies, or drafted legislation, they all sought Mr. Liu's opinion. Even the university graduates who went abroad to study in recent years mostly went to Mr. Liu's place for advice before going abroad, asking him to guide them on research methods and research objects. Therefore, although Mr. Liu has been out of school for many years, his educational work in guiding young people has continued as before. From this, it can be seen that in addition to serving as a consultant for the government authorities, Mr. Liu also serves as a guide for cultivating young economists. This is Mr. Liu's fourth contribution to economics in our country.

(5) Hopes for the Chinese people in the future.

Although economics in our country has greatly improved compared to the past in recent years, there is still a vast field for the Chinese people to develop in the future. After describing Mr. Liu's contribution to economics, I can't help but feel a hundred emotions gathering. In the future, in addition to imitating Mr. Liu's spirit of scholarship, we young people hope that the Chinese people will pay attention to the following points and work together:

(1) Recognize reality. In the past, scholars in our country who engaged in the study of economics often lightly believed in theory and ignored facts, and especially did not pay attention to the domestic economic situation. Therefore, they only used their simple logic to speak out recklessly. Suddenly, they suggested trying the Moscow method in Xi'an. Suddenly, they advocated trying the Chicago system in Hankou. Suddenly, they suggested trying the regulations of London in Shanghai. All of this is endless. After examining the reasons for their bold suggestions, it is because they failed to recognize reality. Therefore, in the future, if we study the economy of our country, the first prerequisite must be to first recognize the actual economic situation of our country. Such as holding economic survey work, or going to the mainland for actual investigation. Thus, we can avoid building a cart behind closed doors and not being able to fit the track.

(2) Pay attention to historical development. The formation of various economic systems must first have a historical background. The change of a system must also have objective conditions. And the composition of future systems must also have indispensable environments. Therefore, its arrival is not accidental, and its departure is not random. Seeking fruit from cause and seeking cause from fruit, they are all closely related to each other. What is this relationship? It is called historical development. In the future, if we study the changes in the economic system, we should pay attention to the process of historical development in order to understand the trend of its changes. Otherwise, what is suggested will not only be cutting the feet to fit the shoes, making it difficult to be practical. It will also be like climbing a tree to catch fish, how can it be of any benefit? The meaning of avoiding fantasy cannot be obtained.

(3) Use numbers and numerical analysis with caution. It is a generally accepted principle that numbers do not lie. However, before applying numbers, you must pay attention to their source. Otherwise, if you misuse them in a roundabout way, the drawbacks will be great. Therefore, if we study economics in the future, we must follow in the footsteps of Mr. Liu and adopt quantitative analysis methods. However, before citing figures, we must first examine their source and the degree of their accuracy. If the accuracy of the figures used is not very high, then the conclusions drawn from the induction will be applicable to an application and it may be reduced to below zero.

(4) The study of economics should start with currency and finance. In the past, economists analyzed the progress of a country's economy, often centering on prices. Therefore, university professors of economics also followed the old method of foreign countries, and taught in the four-part method of consumption, production, transaction, and distribution. However, since our country adopted the legal currency system, the currency and finance of our country are very different from the past. In the future, if we study the changes in the economy of our country, we must first start with currency and finance. The progress of a country's enterprises depends on domestic sales and foreign exports. Domestic sales depend on the level of the domestic value of the currency. At the same time, foreign exports are dominated by the high or low value of the currency to foreign countries. Therefore, Professor Marshall's "Principles of Economics" book excludes currency and finance from the discussion, which seems to only examine the shell of economics, and ignore the arteries and spirit of economics. It is no longer very suitable for the modern environment. Therefore, in the future, if we study economics, we do not have to follow Mr. Marshall's static research, which is reasonable.

(5) Attach importance to planned economy. The various economic control systems implemented during the war can often be regarded as an attempt at economic control. By the time the war ends, a part of the control nature will inevitably be included in the economic system. It is inevitable. Referring to the historical facts after the First World War, it is not difficult to see. Therefore, after the end of the war in our country, because of the devastation everywhere, the economy is in dire need of revival. However, if we rely on the past to let it develop freely, it is not very suitable for post-war China. In order to urge its accelerated revival and modernization, we must adopt a planned economy to make it implement according to the plan and step by step. Therefore, in the future, the Chinese people who study economics should engage in the study of planned economy according to the basic principles of the above (1) (2) (3) and (4). We should also work together to conform to the meaning of Gu Tinglin's saying, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world."

### General Review of Yarn Mill Profits in the Midst of Year End

— Long Jusheng

The annual general closing of factories, companies, and businesses is approaching again! Although the accounting procedures for the closing of accounts of various industrial and commercial organizations are mostly based on the Gregorian calendar, the collection of accounts and the distribution of official dividends are still in accordance with the old lunar year (the old lunar year is actually abolished but not abolished). Amidst the sound of the general closing of the old year, the operating results of the year are revealed! But in reality, it is still kept secret, so as not to be accused by commentators, and to avoid the feeling of being guilty of possessing valuable things! I am just writing some outlines here. What is really happening? It is still unspoken, right?

Everyone knows the good fortune of the Chinese yarn mills that survived on the isolated island! It is a once-in-a-lifetime golden age amidst the crisis and survival of the motherland! In the past two years, earning millions of yuan has been a common thing! But what about this year's profit performance? Although it is relatively dwarfed, it is still very rich! A small yarn mill with 4,000 spindles can also earn 500,000 or 600,000 yuan. As for large yarn mills with more than 100,000 spindles, they can still purchase about 10 million yuan, which is amazing?

We need to know that the standard cost of a 20-count yarn is that cotton accounts for about 900 yuan (cheaper raw materials only require 700 yuan for cotton), and opening and payment fees account for about 200 yuan (170 or 180 yuan is enough for large production). The total cost is a total of more than 1,100 yuan, and the current market price has risen to 1,400 or 1,500 yuan. Even if the annual market price is usually 1,200 or 1,300 yuan, each 20-count yarn can earn at least a net profit of about 150 yuan. What about 32-count and 12-count yarn, which can earn 200 or 300 yuan each? The average production of each spindle is 1.2 pounds of yarn. So, 4,000 spindles can produce 4,200 pounds, which is 10 pieces of yarn. Each year, the net purchase of yarn is 150 yuan. One day and night's work is a total earning of 1,500 yuan a day, and 45,000 yuan a month. Isn't this like earning 500,000 or 600,000 yuan as described above? Those with more than 100,000 spindles are 25 times the number of 4,000 spindles, earning 25 times 500,000 or 600,000. Isn't that going to earn 12 million or 13 million yuan? However, this year, cotton is strictly controlled, and it is not easy to import foreign cotton. Water fees and insurance fees have increased, and the material item in opening and payment has also doubled compared to previous years. Therefore, the profit estimates of each Chinese yarn mill are about 80% compared to last year. The largest surplus is to promote Shenxin Nine (Shuangma Red Brand factory, I heard that it will be wrapped up and sold by 15 large yarn numbers next year?), Shenxin Two (producing Tiannv brand yarn), Xinyu One and Two factories (producing Earth brand yarn), and Yong'an Three Factory (producing Special Jincheng yarn). To determine it, such as: Anda (producing Flying Horse yarn), Xinsheng (producing Golden Tiger brand yarn), Hefeng, Rongfeng and other factories, the business results are very impressive! Last year, the bonus for yarn mill employees could be divided into 600% or 700% (that is, a monthly salary of 100 yuan can get 600 or 700 yuan at the end of the year, which totals 7,800 yuan in twelve months). And this year? Calling 5 yuan (each yuan of salary, then splitting 4 or 5 yuan) can always be divided, so middle-level employees who earn a monthly salary of 100 yuan have also become petty rich! However, the factory regulations do not allow for borrowing for usual family living expenses. The year-end bonus is the only harvest! The only goal of moving east and repaying west! As for the great wealth of the managers? It can be imagined!

### Sugar Market: Today Water Fee Increases, Dutch Sugar Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a continued upward trend due to the increase in the water fee for coarse white sugar by 1 jiao and 6 and a half cents per bag from today onwards. The spot price of 24 coarse white sugar outside the warehouse was 82 yuan, 82 yuan and 5 jiao to 7 jiao, and the price for February 10 was 82 yuan and 7 jiao, 83 yuan to 83 yuan and 2 jiao, up 1 yuan and 3 jiao.

Yesterday, 250 bags of Jinan Government red dates were opened, and the price was 31 yuan. The market price was 32 or 33 yuan. The goods from Du County were difficult to sell well due to the low quality, and were sold for 34 yuan.

### Piece Goods: The Factory's Woolen Cloth Trade is Booming

The trade of woolen cloth from this factory has been quite prosperous recently. Because the imported goods are expensive and scarce, and also meet the tastes of retail customers, the sales of goods from this factory are more smooth than imported goods. Now people in the industry all believe that the market will rise and not fall, and the goods are all held back for higher prices, and the market is strong. Its Yinfeng Caishenhu, and Yihua Wufutu, and Meilun Santa Claus and other temperaments, because Dabojinhua and other inland areas can be sold, the price of the goods is harder than those produced by other factories, and the trade is even more prosperous. Yesterday, the wholesale price of Caishenhu Yuanzhigong woolen cloth was 26 yuan per yard, Wufutu Tuosijin riding breeches woolen cloth was 25 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, and Santa Claus plate four woolen cloth Hailvsi was 10 yuan net price.

### Hardware: Expectation of a Bull Market Through Stockpiling

Recently, in the hardware market, due to the approaching end of the year and various industries preparing for closure, transactions have become abnormal. Prices of all goods have been rising without falling. The reason is the scarcity of incoming goods, while the stock in this port is ultimately limited. Therefore, the idea of stockpiling is strong, with the expectation of a thriving bull market in the new year. Yesterday, products like Huisi iron were at 180 yuan, single-ply tinplate at 145 yuan, double-ply sheets at 278 yuan, local factory nails at 75 yuan, new pan yuan at 80 yuan, and black iron billets at 1,300 yuan.

### Coal: Processed Coal Increases by 10 Yuan, Large Chunks at 12 Yuan Per Load

Processed coal has been in short supply lately because the production of Zilai Fire Company has decreased, while the sales market in this port has become more active. This has caused a significant shortage, with dealers adding 10 yuan. Colleagues are sending it off at 210 yuan per ton, and bulk coal at 200 yuan. Retail in this street is 12 yuan per load (100 market catties) for large chunks, and 11.5 yuan for screened coal, also slightly increasing in price.

### Observations on the Import of Foreign Rice Due to Food Shortages

— Liu Zhonglian

Rice is the staple food of our country, and the people of the South rely on it as an indispensable commodity that cannot be lacking for even a day. The rice-producing areas of our country, such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and other provinces, occupy a vast area, and the production volume is also considerable. However, in recent years, there has been a constant concern about the supply not meeting the demand. Upon examining the crux of the problem, it is nothing more than the following reasons:

(1) Our country's agriculture is underdeveloped;

(2) Our country's population is gradually increasing, with fewer producers and more consumers;

(3) In recent years, there have been constant wars and bandits everywhere, with farmers fleeing and fields becoming ruins, resulting in years without good harvests;

(4) Unscrupulous merchants, driven by greed, hoard and speculate;

(5) In recent years, rice-producing areas have mostly stopped growing rice and instead switched to growing cotton, soybeans, wheat, or vegetables and fruits, according to the suitability of their soil;

(6) After the Japanese government strictly controlled food supplies, the number of farmers switching to other industries has gradually increased, leading to a sense of insufficient food supplies domestically, and a decrease in food production. The amount of food shipped to the occupied areas of our country must be considerable; in addition, the sustenance of the troops in China is entirely dependent on Chinese rice. The lack of rice in our country in recent years is also a major reason.

The above points all have a direct impact on the shortage of food for the people. Since we are aware of the inadequacy of food for the people, we have no choice but to rely on the supply of foreign rice to make up for this deficiency.

Upon investigation, when foreign rice was first imported into our country, the amount was negligible, so tariffs were waived to feed the people. In the early years of the Guangxu era, imports were still small, but they gradually increased. In the first year of the Republic of China, it increased to over 2.7 million loads, in the fourth year to over 8.4 million loads, and in the fifth year to over 11.2 million loads. It then decreased slightly, with only over 1.15 million loads in the ninth year. After the tenth year, the trend increased again, reaching over 22.4 million loads in the twelfth year. It decreased again after the thirteenth year, and then increased again to over 21 million loads in the sixteenth year. In recent years, the import volume has mostly been between 3 and 4 million loads. It is estimated that the import volume in the 26th year reached over 3.4 million loads, over 4 million loads in the 27th year, and over 3.2 million loads in the 28th year. Here is a table showing the import volume of foreign rice since the first year of the Republic of China (unit: loads):

Year 1: 2,700,391
Year 2: 5,414,896
Year 3: 6,774,266

### Roosevelt Inaugurated Today, American Community in Shanghai Celebrates Enthusiastically, Government Offices and Businesses Closed for Celebration, Chinese People Express Limitless Expectations

"The United States can no longer believe in a false sense of security, or the untrustworthy promises of dictators. Only by continuing to provide more active assistance to China and England can we seek self-defense and survival." This is the statement of U.S. Secretary of State Hull. The United States can fulfill this promise, and implement a strong policy against aggressors in both the Far East and Europe, is based on the overwhelming victory of President Roosevelt over isolationism in the general election on November 5th last year. Today is the day President Roosevelt is sworn in for his third consecutive term, and people all over the world who love justice, peace, and freedom are united in congratulating him. It is reported that President Roosevelt's inauguration ceremony will be held at Constitution Hall in Washington today, and he will deliver a brief speech and review the troops. American radio stations and movie theaters will perform special programs from last night to today. One can imagine the nationwide jubilation.

American Community Takes Holiday to Celebrate Enthusiastically

The American community in this port admires President Roosevelt's achievements, and even more supports his Far East policy. They should hold a large-scale celebration on this commemorative day. However, due to environmental constraints, they have to conduct it privately. Therefore, today, the American Consulate, the American General Chamber of Commerce, the American Association, the American Women's Association, the Fourth Regiment, the Yangtze River Fleet, American churches, and American schools are all holding separate celebrations, deeply celebrating the nation's good fortune in having such a leader, and further expressing their loyalty to the country. They also plan to jointly send a telegram to President Roosevelt to express their respect.

Chinese People Express Admiration

The Chinese authorities believe that President Roosevelt's third term is a symbol of the increasingly cordial relations between China and the United States. They have sent a telegram to President Roosevelt to congratulate him, and expressed their hope that these two major countries on the Pacific Ocean will cooperate closely, safeguard true international peace, uphold the eternal justice of mankind, and that the cloudy and uncertain situation in the Far East will be cleared up. The general Chinese public is excited and pleased by Roosevelt's tireless efforts to condemn aggression and assist the weak, as well as his recent emergency measures in the Far East, such as evacuating overseas Chinese and strengthening the fleet. Today, on the inauguration day of Roosevelt, which is closely related to world history, they all express their admiration and increase their unlimited hope.

### Chinese Director Jiang Yiping Resigns, Chen Tingrui Succeeds

Jiang Yiping, the Chinese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, after leaving Shanghai for Chongqing, was recommended by the Board of Directors of Fudan University to concurrently serve as the university's director of general affairs and temporarily replace the dean of the law school (Jiang was originally a director of the university). Therefore, he was unable to return to Shanghai for a time and telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Council to resign as Chinese director. It is now heard that according to the bylaws of the Yangjingbang, when a director leaves office midway, the board of directors should elect a successor. It is now learned that Dr. Chen Tingrui will be recommended to succeed as Chinese director.

### Strict Precautions at the Boundary Between the Two Concessions, Obstacles Placed and Detectives Stationed at Various Road Building Sites Beyond the Boundary

The police authorities of the two concessions, due to the rampant banditry in the road building areas beyond the boundary in western Shanghai, have taken strict precautions in the areas bordering the district. According to a report from the Datong News Agency reporter who visited the area yesterday morning, in addition to setting up barbed wire around the cement bunker at the intersection of Route Doumer and Avenue Haig, police officers from the French Concession Police and French defense forces are stationed there. Two barbed wire fences have also been set up at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Avenue Haig at the western end, with armed detectives from both police stations guarding them. Vehicles and pedestrians passing by are selectively inspected based on suspicion. Other entrances to Great Western Road, Yu Yuan Road, and Jessfield Road are also equipped with barbed wire obstacles, and several patrol officers are stationed to maintain security.

### British Tram Monthly Season Tickets to Increase in Price Starting Next Month, First Class 18 Yuan Per Month, Third Class 22 Yuan Per Two Months

The British Shanghai Tramway Company, recently using the excuse of a sharp increase in expenses, has been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council to implement a price increase of 35% from the 26th of this month. The minimum ticket price will increase from four cents to six cents. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, the prices of the British Tramway monthly season tickets will also increase starting next month. The first-class monthly season ticket will increase from 15 yuan to 18 yuan per month, and the price of the third-class season ticket will increase from 18 yuan to 22 yuan per two months.

### Chinese and Foreign Scouts Mourn Baden-Powell Yesterday, Founder of the Boy Scouts, Posthumously Awarded the Title of Marquis

British Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the World Boy Scout Movement, unfortunately passed away on the 8th at his residence in Kenya at the age of eighty-five. After the sad news was transmitted from London to Shanghai, Chinese and foreign scouts in this port mourned together. Various Boy Scout groups jointly sent a telegram of condolences and sympathy to his family. For the sake of commemorating their founder, the Western scouts held a memorial service at 3 p.m. yesterday at the Grand Church on Jiangxi Road. In addition to male and female Boy Scouts of more than a dozen nationalities, Boy Scouts from Chinese, French, and St. Francis schools, led by their group leader Jiang Yinseng, also participated. Yu, a senior member of the Chinese Boy Scouts, and representatives in Shanghai also attended the meeting. The ceremony was simple but solemn. Baden-Powell devoted his life to Boy Scout education for more than 30 years, making great contributions. The British King awarded him the title of Marquis in 1929.

### Coal Briquettes Fall in Price, Hongji Coal Increases Abnormally

Due to speculators taking advantage of the exchange rate changes in the Shanghai coal market and arbitrarily raising prices again, the price of Hongji lump coal has risen to 250 yuan per ton. However, it has been found that due to the mild weather this winter, the quantity required is only over 4,000 tons per day, which is also less than in previous years. Moreover, due to smooth shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam, the source of Hongji coal is not lacking, and the production of domestic coal is also gradually recovering, so the quantity shipped to Shanghai in recent days is also large. In addition, Japanese Korean coal dust is being dumped in Shanghai in large quantities. Under the above circumstances, the price should fall back.

Coal Briquettes Fall in Price

The market price of coal briquettes was previously secretly raised to 9 yuan per load by several large mechanized coal briquette factories, which caused dissatisfaction. However, because the weather is mild, citizens are saving more, resulting in a large decrease in the actual sales of coal briquettes. In previous winters, the daily sales volume was over 1,000 tons, but now it has decreased by 10% or 20%.

### A Review of Important Administrative Matters of the Public Works Department Over the Past Year (3)

Economic Committee

In accordance with Amendment No. 7 to the resolutions passed by the ratepayers' meeting, the Bureau expanded the Economic Committee, increasing the number of members by eight. Its task was to study how to economize on expenses within the Bureau's existing administrative structure, so as to further solidify the Bureau's financial situation. Committee member Bauer served as chairman.

Road Flooding

In October of last year, the city was attacked by a storm, resulting in widespread flooding throughout the Settlement. According to the Director of Public Works, the city has experienced waterlogging in recent years due to the excessive number of unauthorized constructions in the extra-Settlement road areas of western Shanghai. This has resulted in the destruction of a large portion of the drainage equipment in that area, with ditch water overflowing onto the road surface, reaching the western end of the Settlement's drainage system. Since the beginning of the year before last, the Public Works Department has begun to set up special ditch-cleaning equipment. By the end of that year, the main hub of the drainage system had been completely cleared and remained in a clean state. The major flood that occurred in October of last year was a special circumstance. At that time, a hurricane struck Shanghai, coinciding with a high tidal period, which激起了the river tide, coupled with heavy rainfall that lasted for 24 hours, resulting in the worst flood since 1865. The only solution was to block the outlets of the drains on one hand and use pumps to remove the accumulated water on the other. This plan was designed by the chief engineer of the French Municipal Council years ago, and it is only applicable to the area of the two Settlements south of the Suzhou River. It would cost about 20 million yuan and take ten years to complete.

Election Committee

In August of last year, a committee was set up to study whether the procedures for electing directors in the future could be changed. The committee members were Arlooman, Grace, Mitchell, Suweier, Femaeriga, and Yasui Gengo, totaling six people. (To be continued)

Extra Time, Miserably Defeated

After the break, Donghua Huang Kehou changed to center-back, Liang Shutang moved to the forward, and the Western Police Barda and Willie Watt exchanged positions. Kick off again. Donghua's offensive was not weak, and they attacked the goal several times in a row, but they were all blocked. Qin Bigao became the target of public criticism. Donghua's defense was tight and there were no mistakes. Grenberg secretly fired a cold arrow in the crowd, and Bigao shot it out. Fonseca added a foot, and Bigao forced a corner kick. The Western Police opened it too lightly. Donghua had the opportunity to take a free kick. Han Longhai passed it to Liang Shutang. Outside 30 yards, he raised his foot and knocked on the door, but went over the wood. The statutory time limit was reached, and neither side had been able to achieve anything. According to the usual practice, the time was extended by fifteen minutes. The score in the first half of the field was still 1-1. After the change of sides, both sides showed fatigue. Five minutes later, the Western Police suddenly became active, advancing rapidly along the side, dribbling past Huang and Li, and picking it up in front of the goal. Qin Bigao caught it and lost it again. Willie Watt rushed to the bottom of the net and sent it in. 2-1 Donghua was unfortunately eliminated.

### Family New Year Scenery

—Zhang Mengzhao

——Fruit Platter and Qing Offering on the Desk——

Another year has passed easily, and the Lunar New Year is about to arrive. Thus, thousands of households are busy preparing for the New Year, all looking forward to the new atmosphere of "firecrackers (banned on the isolated island, only money cannons are used as substitutes) sound to remove the old, and peach charms update thousands of households." Nowadays, many families have added eye-catching seasonal products, one is the "fruit platter" and the other is the "Qing offering on the desk"—winter plum, nandina, and narcissus. Even in a small room that can only accommodate the knees, they must try their best to arrange it, in order to create a scene for welcoming the New Year and receiving guests, and also to see the atmosphere and change the new environment after a year of hard work.

The fruit platter is also called the New Year's Eve platter. According to Menglianglu, "On New Year's Eve, the Inner Division Yisiju presented exquisite New Year's Eve fruit boxes, which contained all kinds of fine fruits and market food." According to the old custom, on New Year's Eve, elders gave children fruit platters, which were called New Year's Eve platters. According to Menglianglu, this custom has a long history. Nowadays, the fruit platters sold on the market are even more bizarre and colorful. There are chocolates, peanut brittle, cream candy, almond candy, preserved plums, oranges, banana candy, etc. They are also packed in silk-ribboned glass-faced brocade boxes, dazzling the eyes and fascinating the mind. However, the cost of a box starts from tens of gold, and then hundreds of gold, which is definitely not something that poor scholars dare to ask about or can afford. Even if you give up the whole plate and buy bulk, each pound also requires two or three yuan to six, seven, or nine yuan. The price is several times higher than in previous years. In the psychology of the poor, they can only "plan" how to "fill" their stomachs and how to get through the year. How can they talk about setting up a "fruit platter"?

The winter plum, nandina, and narcissus on the desk, on the other hand, symbolize the unyielding doctrine of patriots, loyal ministers, and righteous men, that is, not being tempted by profit, not being threatened by coercion, and not being humiliated. You see the high integrity of the winter plum, the red heart of the nandina, and the purity of the narcissus, not competing for beauty with ordinary flowers, not fearing the destruction of wind and snow, and not being afraid of the cold weather. The ice and snow spirit of the three is admirable. They are offered on desks to be used as a morning and evening reference for self-alertness. Speaking of plum blossom bonsai, the works of Mr. Kong Zhiqing of Bailuo Shopping Center are the most flavorful, with each pot arranged like a painting. No matter how shabby you are, you have to buy a pot back to celebrate the occasion. Writing to this point, I feel heartbroken that a beautiful fruit plate in my old home in Yangshupu was destroyed! Several goldfish swimming in the glass tank and the plum blossom bonsai sacrificed for the country! I think their spirits are immortal and will surely leave righteousness between heaven and earth.

### Western Suits, Long Robes, and Zhongshan Suits

—Bao Fuxing

In the era we live in, in this Shanghai city we live in, the clothes of the general public are nothing more than three types: Western suits, long robes, and Zhongshan suits. Most of the more progressive elements in society wear Western suits, especially young people such as students. Another more conservative group mostly wears long robes. As for Zhongshan suits, they were once used as uniforms by students and civil servants, but they seem to be rarely seen at present.

Some people have a wrong understanding of Chinese and Western clothing. They think that wearing a Western suit is Westernization and wearing a long robe is following the old ways, and they focus their eyes on the boundary between "Western" and "ancient". In fact, any clothing only seeks to be economical and convenient, so why ask about "Chinese", "Western", "Western", or "ancient"?

Usually, whenever I put on a long robe, I always feel very comfortable, but once I start doing things, it becomes very inconvenient. The sleeves are too wide, and it is not as convenient to walk as in a Western suit. The long robe also has a major shortcoming: the spirit of the person wearing a long robe is often easy to become "gentle" and unable to be invigorated.

I remember someone saying that the Western suit has now become a world garment. Indeed, in our country, including Shanghai, the Western suit has been widely adopted. This is not a false admiration for "Westernization", but because the Western suit has its own advantages. May I ask, among the many people who wear Western suits, how many can be found who are hunchbacked? Strangely enough, the Western suit seems to have a power that can naturally straighten our waists. In addition to this, the Western suit also has a very important advantage, which is also the shortcoming of the long robe, that is, it can make us more energetic when walking and doing things.

Relatively speaking, it is certainly not impossible to wear a long robe, but Western suits are ultimately better. However, in recent years, some people have thought that Western suits are also imperfect. For example, ties and other things are both cumbersome and superfluous. What is the use of them? Fastening them on the neck, wouldn't it hinder hygiene? (This seems to be Lin Yutang's humorous view.) I agree with this view very much. Not only do I agree, but I also think that the style of Western suits is untidy and ugly. Why should there be a blank space in front of the neck for a tie? Why not have a pocket in the upper right corner? Therefore, I think Western suits are also not desirable.

Finally, I would like to contribute a kind of clothing to you, that is, the Zhongshan suit first created by our National Father. The Zhongshan suit can be said to be almost like a Western suit, but it is more beautiful and tidy than a Western suit, and it can also remove the complicated and unnecessary cliches such as wearing a tie. In addition, I would like to ask you to think about it: after wearing a Zhongshan suit, is it convenient and energetic to walk and do things in all aspects?

### Weekly Home Cooking Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

It's Lunar New Year time again. As in previous years, approaching the end of the year, all meat and vegetable prices rise, but this year the increase is particularly frightening. These past few days, encountering several familiar housewives in the market, they all shook their heads and sighed, repeatedly exclaiming, "Expensive! Expensive! Expensive!" Carrying thirty or forty dollars, hoping to buy some chicken, fish, fresh meat, or cured meat, one finds it difficult to know where to start and can only return home with an empty basket. Such a situation is unprecedented. It truly makes one feel like one is eating banknotes rather than vegetables. I advise housewives, if your financial resources are abundant, then go to the market and splurge. But if your resources are limited, everyone should save a little, regardless of whether it's the New Year or not!

### Comprehensive Housing Considerations

— Wang Yizhi

The latest knowledge and experience in civil engineering, very useful for the people of Shanghai.

Contemporary builders, to prevent problems before they arise, have recently learned from the reconstruction in Europe after the war, and offer the following latest insights on "air raid" prevention:

(1) A square-shaped residence surrounded on all four sides, leaving a gap in the middle as a backyard, separated from the neighbors on the left, right, and rear only by a wall or fence, with no accessible door and no way to quickly escape outwards. In the event of aerial bombing, the "air pressure" is trapped inside and cannot easily expand outwards, greatly increasing the destructive force and potentially doubling the danger. The new method avoids the encirclement of dead-end streets and high firewalls, instead creating front and rear rows of buildings that are not connected at both ends, with the gap between the rows serving as the backyard. Moreover, these two rows of buildings facing each other across the alley should be at least 24 meters apart.

(2) In large buildings shared by several families, in addition to ascending and descending via the stairwell and the main entrance at the front, an additional staircase must be built, with another door opening to the backyard. The space under the stairs is best used as a storage room, serving as an air raid shelter.

(3) For houses with thick and expensive materials, the new method allows one to pass through a tunnel after exiting the door at the bottom of the stairs, leading to the street.

(4) Every home must have three doors: a front door, a back door, and a door that allows interconnection with neighbors.

(5) The main structural materials of the house should be changed to steel-reinforced concrete, which not only prevents the ravages of fire but also blocks the outward transmission of sound waves.

(6) Inside the house, the windows and the floor should not be connected or touching any wood. The floor laid flat in the room should not be connected or touching the floor of the adjacent room. These methods are all for preventing fire.

(7) Interior corridors or air raid shelters should have a brick-and-stone arch (similar to Chinese city gate tunnels) on top, which has the greatest resistance to collapse and is very useful for air defense. Wooden staircases are best avoided altogether.

(8) Small window panes that are struck by the "air pressure" of a bombing will suffer less damage. For large panes of glass, do not forget to install "louvered wooden shutters Jaloladen" on the outside to strictly block light leakage, or cover them with iron "roller shutters Roladen" that are easy to raise and lower for protection, thus avoiding the problem of faint light leaking from the gaps in the curtains under special fire control regulations.

(9) Essential home defense tools: one is a shovel for digging soil, two is an axe for clearing obstructions, three is a bell for calling for help in distress, and four is a climbing rope six meters long and 3/8 mm in diameter with a "Carbine Hook" for easily climbing and securing heavy loads.

Casual Talk
— Nian Yun

"Eat more, talk less" seems a bit unfashionable to say nowadays.

Rice prices are high, and everyone feels the threat, but the mice in the rice stores are unaffected, with an inexhaustible supply of food, which is enviable.

In the past, when writing letters to elders, one would end with the phrase "Please eat well and add to your meals," but nowadays it's a bit difficult to write that.

Although many people are starving to death on the "isolated island," quite a few are also dying from overeating.

### Recent Trends in Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation at the Year-End Market (Part 2)

— Tian Shi

Those used as substitutes for wood, such as making into a xiao flute, produce a clear and ethereal sound. When made into a violin Violine (four-stringed instrument), the sound is clear and penetrating. Those used as substitutes for iron, such as making into springs, are supple and unbreakable. When made into wall clocks (as shown in Figure 2), from the large clock face to the small gears or hands, or elastic springs, everything is transparent inside and out. When made into camera lenses or women's clothing ornaments, they are as crystal clear as glass, and it is difficult to distinguish whether they are crafted by ghosts or refined jade.

4. Transportation.  The materials used to replace hard rubber but with slight elasticity seem to be newer with Trolit. Trolit is like stalactites formed over time by carbonic acid lime accumulating and hanging down from crevices in rocks where spring water drips. Using limestone and charcoal as raw materials, it softens like clay when exposed to high heat of 125 to 195 degrees Celsius. After being ejected into a cooler under high pressure, it can be easily shaped, and can be made into compass dials, eyeglass cases, typewriter boxes, fountain pen barrels, or pencil tubes. Another type uses limestone and charcoal as raw materials and undergoes complex processes in chemistry to form "Mipolam. " This material resembles leather and rubber and is an improved artificial rubber that does not show cracks after being used for a long time. It is used to replace leather in the manufacture of travel bags or handbags for women's use. When used to replace metal objects, it is mostly made into pipes, which weigh only one-eighth as much as red copper and lead. It can be bent, sawn, cut, ground, and pierced with a cone. It does not ignite, is not corroded by oil, water, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, etc., and is not damaged by chemical reactions in water, and does not cause liquids entering and exiting the pipe to be tainted with a slight odor or strange taste. Mineral springs in sanatoriums use this Mipolam piping, which is very convenient for distributing drinks to various faucets, and tea restaurants can use this material for water pipes, which can also save labor of transportation and extraction of wine cellars.

Spring and Autumn

### Lunar New Year's Eve Dinner Before Qin

— Hammer Mang

Holidays belong to the wealthy, like Manager Huang, Comprador Pan, who celebrate Christmas, the Winter Solstice, and the Western New Year. After enjoying the three days of the Western New Year, Mrs. Huang and Mrs. Pan go shopping for New Year's goods, preparing to eat Lunar New Year's Eve dinner...

The Southern Goods store is packed with two or three layers of people, but the ladies have a chair to sit on, leisurely selecting top-quality black fungus, sea cucumber, shiitake mushrooms, silver fish, chatting and laughing with the young clerk. The clerk ties up the packages one by one, and the maids pile them into the car, which looks like a warehouse. This mobile warehouse makes the poor gawk!

New invention: Lunar New Year's Eve dinner, 40 yuan, 50 yuan...120 yuan per table: "Welcome to book your Lunar New Year's Eve dinner," "Top Scholar Lunar New Year's Eve Dinner," "God of Wealth Lunar New Year's Eve Dinner," "Get Rich Lunar New Year's Eve Dinner" — Get rich, get rich, the rich become even richer. After eating the Lunar New Year's Eve dinner, they calculate their hoarding plans, aiming for a windfall next year, aiming for a big score, making a fortune...

On the wall with "No Urinating" there is a gray piece of paper, a bitter complaint from an apprentice, scrawled in uneven pencil, an exchange of blood and tears: "Sirs, we are not as good as those who farm the land. The boss only gives us four yuan for the New Year. How is that enough for us!" Following is a list of daily necessities: "Haircut 30 cents, cloth shoes 2 yuan a pair, toothbrush 30 cents each, towel, soap, fried meat balls..." This is the minimum expense for a poor apprentice, but how can everyone have enough with four yuan. At that "silver-tabled" Lunar New Year's Eve dinner, there are fresh dishes, fresh verdant daffodil branches—just a waste of one night, the apprentice's roughest necessities for a year! A year! A new need for a year, a material desire below the poverty line, but still a zero...

Sirs, I must have seen a piece of news, when a young woman was getting on the tram, because she had eaten too much, she vomited the fish and meat and rice she had eaten. Immediately, before the street cleaner could bother, a poor person ate the vomit again... This story, no, this living picture, even the most avant-garde painter would not have thought of this subject. Yes, in a night when many people are eating Lunar New Year's Eve dinner, in the alley, there is an animal rummaging in the trash can, rummaging for the scraps of Lunar New Year's Eve dinner that others have left over, oh, even the very clean meat bones. Is it a dog? No, it is a person...

The poor live day to day, those who swell their faces to survive can only swallow their tears into their stomachs. — Year-end, year-end — expenses, expenses — dodge debts, dodge debts: three strict and unrelaxed melodies disturb these people's eardrums. Lunar New Year's Eve dinner, drag it on, drag it on, but in the end it has to be eaten on the last day, but it cannot be like the managers and compradors who wipe their mouths and that is it — there is a dark heavy gate behind...

Some people eat two Lunar New Year's Eve dinners — Small Lunar New Year's Eve dinner, Big Lunar New Year's Eve dinner; some eat it with worry, some eat it happily, and even more have nothing to eat...

He casually tossed away the cigarette butt, lowered his head, and brushed off the ash from his body, completely without needing Shao Wen to further confirm the meaning of what he said, seemingly very understanding.

"Am I not aware of that?" The Western-dressed gentleman said, not wanting to be outdone.

Yuan Shaowen smiled at both of them, then shook his head and said:

"This name was thought up by him and me together, and the reason for it is probably not easy to guess!" He looked back at the skinny man. "Mr. Zhongqian is indeed a Ping opera performer, but he was wrong just now..."

The skinny man awkwardly twirled his Fu Manchu mustache with his left hand, because Shao Wen's criticism of what he said made him somewhat unhappy; but Shao Wen calling him a Ping opera performer was very much to his liking.

"This name isn't like Red Peony, Hibiscus, or Little Lingzhi, just meant to make people feel beautiful and enchanting immediately upon seeing it." Yuan Shaowen leaned to the side, rested his chin on one hand, and said in a very excited tone, "It happened last summer. Little Wu's mother had only passed away for a week or two. Because he was very sad, he stayed at home and didn't perform, so he asked me to accompany him and chat every day, and by the way, review the books I taught him last year. Don't think he's just an opera performer; he actually knows he has a country in his heart! He often asked me about the news of the times and how badly China was being bullied. Of course, I told him as much as I knew, and I even gave him an example, saying that China's terrain, when connected as a whole, looks just like a begonia leaf, and those ambitious countries are like caterpillars that specialize in eating begonia leaves. Some have already bitten off a piece on the edge of the leaf, and some are still gnawing in the center of the leaf. If we can't drive these caterpillars away, this begonia leaf will be eaten up..."

"That's right, a very good analogy!" The young man in the Western suit tapped the table with his fingers, expressing his agreement very innocently; the skinny man lit another Fortress brand cigarette, appearing not very interested in listening. (13)

### Golden Pearl of Tiger's Courage

— Xiu Bi

——Street Sketches, Part 1

A middle-aged man with a face covered in stove ash was silently drawing on the sidewalk with chalk, drawing.

Many curious children gathered from all directions, forming a circle.

What is that guy doing? Some children thought.

"A snake! A snake!" Before long, many children shouted.

"A snake! That's right! Snake," the man heard the children's voices, stood up, and forced his hoarse throat to shout, "Friends, there are various kinds of snakes, some..."

After he shouted so loudly, the people loitering around also gathered around him. There were black-clad "knights," "sisters-in-law" who hang around, "friends" from factories, and... in short, the audience was also diverse.

"Listen to me, there is a kind of snake called the Little Green Snake, also known as the Bamboo-encased Green... there is one called the Red-banded Racer... there is one called the Seven-foot Snake. If it bites someone, the person will 'die' after walking seven feet. This kind of snake is the most vicious. There is also the Cobra, also known as the Rattlesnake, that is terrible, not a 'game', blood is seen on the spot, and death follows immediately... The terror of poisonous snakes is truly 'irreversible'."

The speaker spoke while gesticulating, saliva flying everywhere, fully showing his "vigor." "But, why? Why is he so excited?" Many listeners could not help but guess.

Don't worry, the explanation is coming. As soon as the man saw that the crowd was listening with great interest, he pulled out a cloth bag—a small, rectangular cloth bag—from his pocket and held it in his hand.

"But, what should you do if you are really bitten by a poisonous snake? Wait to die? Hmph, if you don't encounter a brother, of course, you can only wait to die..."

So, he is actually a man with great magical powers!

"But, if you are lucky enough to encounter a brother, like today, then there is nothing to fear. Speaking of this, some friends may want to ask, what abilities does this brother have? Nothing else, but this bag in my hand is a treasure for saving the world and helping people." (To be continued)

### A Striving Philosophy of Life (20)

Failing to recognize the object of fear clearly leads to fearing the enemy's illness. Feeling too small leads to fearing one's own illness. Because of fearing the enemy, one fears oneself. Because of fearing oneself, one fears the enemy. These two psychological illnesses are always related and extend to each other. What striving, how can one even be worthy of discussing it!
