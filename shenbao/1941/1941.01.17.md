### U.S. Secretary of State Hull's Speech: Strongly Condemns Aggressor Nations, Clearly Warns Japan Regarding Government's Position, Urges Expedited Aid to Britain to Resist Violent Rule

Washington - Yesterday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held an unofficial vote, resulting in 12 members in favor of the aid to democratic nations bill, 6 against, and 5 undecided. Representative Fish, a Republican Congressman from New York and a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, stated that the House will continue debating the bill in the committee today, during which Secretary of the Navy Knox will participate and speak on behalf of the Navy Department. Wilkie, the unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate, and Kennedy, the recently resigned U.S. Ambassador to Britain, will also attend and testify on Tuesday and Wednesday. (United Press, 15th)

Washington - Secretary of State Hull publicly condemned Japan's joining of Germany and Italy's "aggression and violent rule" in Congress yesterday, stating that providing full assistance of raw materials to democratic nations is the best guarantee to avoid being drawn into war. The Secretary of State vehemently criticized totalitarian states and urged the prompt passage of the aid to democratic nations bill. He also engaged in heated debate with many members of the House of Representatives. He stated that Japan is currently seeking to develop the entire Western Pacific for its own benefit, depriving and expelling the interests of outsiders, and that vigorously assisting Britain with raw materials is "the best guarantee for the United States to avoid being drawn into war." Hull urged "expedited" aid to Britain, stating, "We are currently maintaining neutrality, but we cannot be anesthetized by neutrality and develop a mistaken view of national defense security." Hull also stated that he believes the United States will face crises regardless of its actions. He opposed suggestions to deal with the Axis powers through appeasement, asserting that the United States cannot induce Japan to abandon its established path. The Secretary of State then ridiculed Germany for regarding the aid to democratic nations bill, especially the provision for repairing British ships, as a violation of international law, deeming it a "shameless" act. He stated that the Axis powers have also conflicted with international law on numerous occasions, but they have never paid attention to it. Hull then reiterated President Roosevelt's original plan, declaring that he would not send American personnel to Europe. He also stated that these dictators have "sufficiently awakened our sense of self-defense. It is conceivable that they will mistreat us again in the future."

Axis Nations' Aggression Continues Unabated; America Should Take Timely Self-Defense Measures

Hull stated that Japan is initially embarking on a "fatal path" sufficient to destroy the "law-abiding civilized world" and unite the Japanese people. The aggressive actions of Italy and Germany over the past fifteen years have forced the United States to become an armed fortress. The Secretary of State stated while requesting support for the passage of the Lend-Lease Act that Japan's invasion of Manchuria and other actions infringing upon American rights, followed by Japan's abrogation of the 1922 naval treaty, are all examples of its "countless actions" to deal with China and expand its rule over China. He declared that Japan intends to establish hegemony throughout the Western Pacific in accordance with its "broad and ambitious plan." Hull stated that this move would allow the entire region to be developed solely for the benefit of the Japanese, while the interests of third countries would be deprived and disregarded. He announced that he had advised the Japanese government that Japan's greatest interest lies in developing relations with the United States and other countries based on order, peace, and benevolence. He said, "We have never made any threats." Hull also stated that the security of the Western Hemisphere lies in allowing the democratic nations to receive raw material assistance "with agile speed" so that they can resist the aggression of totalitarian countries. He refused to comment on the specific provisions of the aid to democratic nations bill, but stated that he wished to discuss "foreign aggression and violent rule." He stated that Germany's primary goal would be to focus on Western Hemisphere countries that are weaker than the United States. If Germany can control the oceans, the situation will change drastically. Therefore, we must consider Germany's process to be an action of "conquering the earth." We should take timely self-defense measures to avoid being too late. Hull also stated, "I cannot betray my conscience by advising my compatriots to follow the suicidal path of Holland, Belgium, and other countries, which initially took neutrality as their guiding principle and then inevitably reached permanent destruction." Hull also stated that he does not believe the Johnson Act conflicts with the current steps. He also stated that cutting off aid to Britain will not lead to peace but will only strengthen the Axis powers, allowing them to take a breather and carry out further conquests. What we are currently encountering is a force without law, morality, or doctrine. They are currently trying to control both oceans as an important foundation for maintaining their future conquests. The Secretary of State continued, stating that Denmark had signed a non-aggression pact with Germany, as had Norway. Therefore, seeking security solely through neutrality is futile.

Hull Briefly Outlines Diplomatic Policy, Striving to Enhance International Cooperation

Hull then provided a brief summary of American policy, stating, "Our diplomatic policy has always progressed towards the following points: (1) Striving for peace and security within the United States, with peace and arms reduction as international goals; (2) Supporting order, fairness, and non-interventionism; (3) Restoring effective economic measures and relationships based on equality; (4) Striving to effectively enhance international cooperation; (5) Enhancing the security, stability, and general well-being of the Western Hemisphere." After Hull delivered his speech, Congressman Eaton, a Republican from New Jersey, asked, "If Britain wins, we will no longer need its national defense program, will we?" Hull replied, "That is correct." He then asked, "If Germany, Italy, and Japan win, we will need a national defense program, and no one will be able to help us then, will they?" Hull said, "I agree with that statement." Hull then listened to Tinkham read his prepared declaration opposing the bill, calling it the establishment of a dictatorial system in the United States. The Secretary of State responded, "I believe the author of this document will still be reciting it when Britain is conquered and South America is invaded, without thinking of taking any action. The majority of the people of Holland and Poland also read similar announcements, but today they are all prisoners." Tinkham then asked Hull, "Does this bill stipulate that whenever a country is attacked, the United States will provide the same assistance? If the Soviet Union is attacked, will the United States also provide assistance?" Hull stated, "That question is too idealistic. I do not believe you hope to discuss it." Congressman Tinkham, a Republican from Massachusetts, also expressed his opinion after listening to Hull's speech, believing that the bill is tantamount to authorizing President Roosevelt to take war actions. The Secretary of State responded that he already possesses all the power he needs. (United Press, 16th)

Japan Intends to Control the Western Pacific, Excluding Other Countries' Interests in China

Hull then commented in a condemning tone on Japan's large-scale invasion of China with a million troops in 1937 and its occupation of coastal and inland provinces, saying, "It is very clear that Japan has been driven from the beginning by a far-reaching and ambitious plan to place itself in the most superior position in the entire Western Pacific. Its leaders openly declared that they would achieve this position by force."

America Cannot Sit Idly By as Half of the World's People are Butchered

Washington - Secretary of State Hull launched an extremely fierce attack on the aggressor nations, especially Japan, when the House Foreign Affairs Committee met yesterday to consider the Lend-Lease Act. His comments on the actions of Japan, from the perspective of the U.S. government and the State Department, led listeners to believe that it is rare for a country's diplomatic leader to criticize another country so resolutely before the two countries have broken off relations. Therefore, it is recognized that Hull's remarks are a clear warning to Japan, telling it not to assume that the United States is not prepared to resist and will sit idly by as half of the world's people are slaughtered. Hull's remarks can also be regarded as a notification to Japan, informing it that the United States is aware of Japan's threat to the United States, and for the sake of U.S. security, has received Japan's threat as it deserves, and is prepared to deal with all events that the Japanese or any other aggressor nation may create. After Hull stated the peaceful intent of U.S. policy, he said that the three nations of Germany, Italy, and Japan have made it sufficiently clear in words and deeds that they are determined to destroy the foundation of the civilized world order under the law, and embark on the path of armed conquest, butchering other countries, and ruling the peoples of various countries with hegemony. The first step first appeared in the Far East, at that time it was maintained, so that they are forever the masters in an area that occupies almost half of the world's people. If Japan gets its wish, then Japan will have full authority to dominate the oceans and trade routes in this region. Past experience and current developments all indicate that its so-called new order is nothing more than a group that enjoys the highest political power, and economically, exclusively uses the resources within its jurisdiction, so that other parts of the region eventually become impoverished, the interests of other countries are excluded, and socially, individual freedom is eradicated, so that the conquered become its slaves. The meaning of this program, which seeks to dominate nearly half of the world's people with one country, is an event that cannot be ignored by other countries in various places, and should be known to everyone.

Lend-Lease Act Should Be Handled Quickly to Protect Peace in the Americas

Today's Lend-Lease Act is a proposal that allows the United States to use its resources in the most secure way to protect the peace of the United States and the Americas. This case should be handled in the most rapid manner possible to ensure all security matters. What we need most today is speed. Control of the high seas is extremely important. If the three allied nations obtain this control, then the dangers that our country will encounter will be manifold compared to today.

### U.S. Troops Head to Newfoundland

The first batch of U.S. troops dispatched to the military bases leased from Britain set sail for Newfoundland last night. The ship they were aboard was the former German mail ship America, which was obtained by the U.S. during the last war and has now been re-equipped as the world's most luxurious troop transport.

Editorial

### Hull's Speech and Japanese Movements

Yesterday's editorial reviewed Japan. Although it was considered difficult to understand why Japan would overestimate its capabilities and take great risks, committing great injustice to fulfill its ambitions, it was believed that there was no hope for Japan to change its course, repent its mistakes, and restrain itself in the future. Continuing reports from Tokyo offer no new developments, but there is enough to prove that the analysis in yesterday's review was not wrong: One is that Prime Minister Konoe summoned representatives of the House of Peers to ask for their cooperation; followed by summoning the press for a meeting of the same nature. This cooperation is Konoe seeking support from all sides for Japan's current policies. One is that Minister of the Army Tojo suddenly invited senior military officers, including more than ten former Prime Ministers and Ministers of the Army, as well as the current Chief of the Army General Staff, Army adjudicators, and the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, to hold a roundtable meeting to discuss the so-called national emergency situation. This is also regarded as an extraordinary step in Tokyo that is beyond the expectations of ordinary people. It is reported that Tojo's main point was that he is prepared and determined to deal with all difficulties and strive to win victory together with Germany and Italy. One is that the so-called Association for the Liberation of Oppressed Nations in South Asia has come forward to launch its divisive movement against Britain, America, and France. Under Japanese military rule, no matter how they tout it as the actions of civic-minded individuals, anyone can see at a glance where the source of the behind-the-scenes instigation is. Summing up these three movements reported yesterday, it can be seen that the Japanese are making every effort to rally their last courage. Although those who play with tactics may have internally decided on a sharp turn downwards, in the moment before the turn, they often make sufficient gestures of rapid advance. Therefore, after observing each current movement, it is necessary to reserve some judgment on what the actual movement will be. However, with Japan exhausted by its war against China and its national strength depleted, it is extremely difficult for it to make any surprising moves. Apart from this inference, there is absolutely no sign that can be used to imagine any changes in Japan, at least not in the era when Konoe is in power.

What is more interesting and more impressive than Japan's attitude is the magnanimity of the American authorities. It will soon be a year since the United States announced the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. All the measures taken over the past year have been directed against Japan, only because there is still hope that Japan will see the opportunity to change its course, so it does not make Japan look too embarrassed on the surface. Unexpectedly, Japan, seeing America's leniency, mistakenly believes that there may be room for change in American policy. It just so happens that there are still "isolated factions" in America who occasionally stimulate Japan's侥幸心理. For example, recently, when the U.S. Congress discussed the bill on leasing military equipment to aid democratic countries, some people advocated discriminating against China and Britain, so that this bill would not apply to aid to China. This is a method that Japan seeks but cannot get, and the German and Italian sides secretly rejoice that people in the U.S. Congress are willing to open a side. Germany and Italy are not opposed to China, but wish to destroy Great Britain. American aid to China seems to have no vested interest in Germany and Italy, but in order to obtain effective containment and support from Japan in the Far East, they also want Japan to withdraw from the quagmire in China as soon as possible. The impact of American aid to China will make Japan even more hopeless to extricate itself. Therefore, the American lease of war equipment and aid to China and Britain are closely related issues that cannot be divided into two parts. If the United States sits idly by and watches China fail, the bad consequences that the United States will suffer in the Far East and the Pacific will be another issue. However, after Japan is unscrupulous, it will deepen the serious oppression of Britain in the Far East, and also allow Germany and Italy to obtain effective containment and support against Britain in the Far East, ultimately making America's aid to Britain in the Atlantic completely devoid of meaning and value. Therefore, the proposal to discriminate against China and Britain, in form, seems only to modify the lend-lease bill and narrow its scope, but in essence, it is tantamount to making the United States' aid to Britain completely wasted in the Atlantic, making the bill completely change its nature. From another perspective, this proposal, in form, discriminates against Germany, Italy, and Japan, but in essence, it is a tacit assistance to Germany and Italy by pardoning Japan. The American authorities are not as incompetent as this. Secretary of State Hull delivered a righteous and stern speech in Congress yesterday in order to advocate maintaining the lend-lease bill. Not only did he incisively explain the necessity of American aid to China and Britain, but he also, as the responsible authority, openly condemned Japan for the first time. Readers, try reading carefully Hull's speech published in today's newspaper, and then take a look at the latest movements in Tokyo. Although the actual movements of the next scene cannot be predicted, the final trend is not difficult to foresee!

Before the actual movements of the next scene, what is worth watching in the next few days is Japan's reaction after Hull's speech. As mentioned earlier, Japan only sees America's leniency. Therefore, although American policy is extremely firm, Japan still wants to use diplomatic actions and diplomatic rhetoric to hope for the success of stealing the day. Now that Hull's criticism is so blatant, we do not believe that Foreign Minister Matsuoka, who prides himself on his eloquence, will make any more ineffective sophistry. What is worth noting is not whether or how to argue, but that Japan's current policies, by yesterday and today, have been exposed head-on by the United States. This is a short-handed engagement outside of gunfire. If Japan does not turn back sharply, it will only have to risk everything on one throw. If Britain loses and loses its control of the sea, then unless we are prepared and able to do what Britain is doing now, Germany can easily cross the Atlantic, especially the South Atlantic. Once the Atlantic falls under German control, then this ocean cannot provide us with any security guarantees. Therefore, it goes without saying how important it is now to give Britain and other countries that resist the Axis the greatest material assistance. When members of the Foreign Affairs Committee inquired about issues such as the repair of ships of belligerent countries in American ports, whether we violated international law, Hull replied, "In the face of generally recognized acts of aggression and conquest, should peaceful countries sit and wait for the aggressors to enter their borders directly, or should we recognize that this is a global act of aggression and take self-defense measures to avoid regretting it too late? This is the question." (Reuters, 16th)

Tokyo, Japan - Japanese Foreign Ministry officials have not yet commented on U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. According to Japanese officials, Hull's remarks did not offer anything new besides pushing the United States closer to war. President Roosevelt, in his recent fireside chat and budget message, had already effectively placed the United States in a position to potentially transform the current war into a world war. If the United States continues to insist on a hostile attitude, then this situation may be unavoidable. (Reuters, 16th)

Tokyo - This morning, Japanese newspapers headlined U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement to the House Foreign Affairs Committee in large characters. Yomiuri Shimbun claimed that the United States was intimidated by the shadow of war in the Pacific. Hull slandered Japan with absurd remarks and tried to pass the aid to Britain bill. Hochi Shimbun said that the United States was afraid of imaginary attacks. Hull slandered the efforts of Germany, Italy, and Japan in his statement. (Reuters, 16th)

### U.S. Treasury Secretary Supports Lend-Lease Bill

Washington - Treasury Secretary Morgenthau spoke to the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday in support of President Roosevelt's Lend-Lease Act and submitted a memorandum showing that Britain has £443,000,000 in funds in the United States to pay for U.S. exchange rates. It stated that from November 1st of this year to January 1st of next year, Britain must pay £75,500,000 to repay the price of goods purchased in the United States. This number exceeds £36,600,000 of all the funds that Britain has in the United States to pay for goods. The funds that Britain has to pay for U.S. exchange rates, which are designated as liquid, total £21,800,000. When the Foreign Affairs Committee asked whether the numbers he cited referred to prices that had already been ordered, Morgenthau replied yes. This financial situation shows that Britain can only pay for what has already been purchased with current funds, but when seeking U.S. dollars as needed, Britain will surely obtain them. The British government has a large amount of gold scattered all over the world, but most of it cannot be transported to the United States quickly or safely. British banks, private individuals, and companies have US$30.6 million in deposits in the United States. Morgenthau also said in response to questions that Britain needs a huge amount of military equipment from the United States, which is its only source of supply. Britain currently has no U.S. dollar foreign exchange to pay for this amount, so there is a need to establish this kind of law so that it can obtain the urgently needed arms. Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee expressed great concern about Britain's assets in South America. Morgenthau published figures, stating that Britain's investments outside the United States total £3,868,000,000, of which £1,002,000,000 are in Latin America. (Reuters, 16th)

### Britain Investigates U.S.-Soviet Trade, Whether Raw Materials are Transported to Germany

London - Today, well-informed sources here stated that regarding the large increase in the import of American goods into the Soviet Union (especially cotton), the British are currently making friendly inquiries about this in Washington, fearing that the Soviet Union may transfer them to Germany. It is rumored that the Soviet Union is now planning to organize a fleet of two hundred merchant ships to be used exclusively to transport raw materials from the United States and other countries in the Americas, via the Pacific Ocean, through Vladivostok, to Russia. (International News Service, 16th)

### U.S. Army and Navy to Conduct Joint Exercises Next Week; Navy Department Submits Bill to Both Houses Advocating Construction of 400 Small Ships

Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters yesterday that the U.S. Atlantic Fleet will begin joint army and navy exercises in the Caribbean Sea next Tuesday, which is an annual routine. He said that this move does not involve the new Atlantic bases obtained from Britain. (Reuters, 16th)

Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox announced yesterday that he would place the national naval shipyards on an "expedited" basis of three shifts per day, eight hours per shift, to accelerate the construction of a two-ocean navy. Meanwhile, Knox and Secretary of the Army Stimson announced that the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps will hold joint exercises in the Caribbean Sea starting next Tuesday. The warships participating in the exercises will be drawn from the newly formed Atlantic Fleet. The Army's First Regiment will depart from New York on Tuesday. The Marine Corps will be represented by the First Regiment. (Associated Press, 16th)

Washington - The Navy Department has submitted a bill to both houses of Congress advocating the construction of 400 small warships, most of which are submarine destroyers and mine-laying ships. The bill has recently been submitted to the House Naval Affairs Committee for discussion. Vice Admiral Robinson immediately attended to explain the reasons, saying that the United States urgently needs to build 280 such warships and should allocate US$385 million to start construction as soon as possible. In addition, the committee also passed a bill stipulating an allocation of US$100 million to strengthen the U.S. fleet's air defense equipment. The bill will soon be submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion. (Havas, 15th)

Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters yesterday that the U.S. Navy is now planning to reorganize its shipyards as soon as possible and work according to a 72-hour week system. Most shipyards are still working on a 48-hour week system. (Reuters, 16th)

### North African Sandstorms Obscure the Sky; British Troops Fight Laboriously; Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet, Sir Andrew Cunningham, Promoted to Admiral

LONDON (Reuters Special Correspondent from Tobruk Front Headquarters): British forces must wait somewhat before attacking Tobruk, so that patrols can scout Tobruk's defenses, and at the same time, store sufficient food, water, ammunition, and other military supplies. British troops set out from Alexandria or Cairo bases to attack Tobruk, with no water or gasoline depots along the way, and sandstorms obscure the sky, often cutting off roads and airfields for several days, making combat particularly difficult. The more I see in the Western Desert, the more I realize how difficult it is for British forces to take Tobruk. Holding Bardia is done by others, not the Italians, and may delay the British advance for months. I inspected the Bardia defense area for two days and saw that the natural defenses were excellent, and the stored ammunition and food were extremely sufficient, yet the Italian troops defending Bardia surrendered after only thirty-six hours of fighting. British officers and soldiers are all amazed by this. (Reuters, 16th)

LONDON: Today, activities in the Tobruk area are limited to aerial patrols. According to a British pilot's report, no Italian troop activity was seen flying over a hundred miles beyond Tobruk. (Reuters, 16th)

CAIRO: Headquarters intelligence reported yesterday that British forces gradually surrounding Tobruk "have achieved success on all fronts." The intelligence continued, "Patrol activities continue to be carried out." (Associated Press, 16th)

LONDON: Severe sandstorms occurred in the Western Desert a few days ago. British artillery is now carrying out a bombardment of the Italian defense line in a unified manner, and there are night reconnaissance teams testing the strength of the Italian positions. So far, the support provided by the Italian Air Force to the Tobruk garrison is equal to the situation in Bardia. (Reuters, 10th)

CAIRO: The situation in North Africa and East Africa remains unchanged. A British statement said that there is continued active reconnaissance activity on all fronts (Reuters, 16th)

LONDON: Sir Andrew Cunningham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet, has been promoted from Vice Admiral to Admiral on January 3rd. Under his command, the Mediterranean Fleet assisted British forces in defeating Italian troops along the North African coast and achieved glorious victories in the Mediterranean. Also, Vice Admiral Sir Horton has also been promoted to Admiral on January 9th. During the last Great War, he led submarines to sink one enemy cruiser, three destroyers, and two transport ships. (Reuters, 16th)

MOSCOW: The Soviet trade union organization "Trud" recently published a long article discussing the serious predicament of Italian troops in Africa, stating briefly that, according to British figures, British forces in Libya already have a multiple numerical advantage over Italian troops. According to the development situation, the British have stationed 100,000 troops in Sudan and Kenya and plan to expand their activities in East Africa. The recent development is very important to the African theater of war, and it implies that the British want to clear up the African war, so that they can concentrate their strength on the European theater and decide the final victory. (Reuters, 16th)

### British Admiralty Announces: Cruiser Sunk; Blasted and Ablaze, Irreparable; British Submarine Sinks Two Italian Ships

LONDON: According to the Admiralty's announcement, the British cruiser Southampton was attacked by a joint German-Italian air force in the central Mediterranean on Friday, hit by bombs and caught fire. Because it could not be towed to port for repairs, the British themselves devised a way to sink it. Most of the crew members have been rescued. This ship displaces 9,100 tons, was launched in 1936, is equipped with twelve six-inch caliber guns and eight four-inch caliber high-angle guns, six torpedo tubes, a speed of thirty-two knots per hour, and carries three seaplanes. (Reuters, 16th)

LONDON: A correspondent traveling with the British aircraft carrier Illustrious has now recounted in detail how the ship was recently bombed by German planes. Although it was hit by heavy bombs at the beginning, it still fought bravely for seven hours and finally drove away the German planes. It is said that when the air raid alarm sounded, he was in the dining room. Upon hearing the alarm, he rushed to the wheelhouse. In an instant, a heavy bomb fell on the deck. All the ship's guns opened fire at the same time, but German planes still dive-bombed from all directions. At that time, bombs fell nearby, and the gunners risked shrapnel and machine-gun fire, holding fast to their unprotected gun positions and helping to move the wounded to safety. From 2:00 PM to 7:30 PM, the sound of bombs and anti-aircraft guns was almost uninterrupted for several minutes. Currently, the ship has used its own steam power to enter the port. German planes have dropped at least one hundred thousand-pound bombs, determined to sink the ship. (Reuters, 16th)

LONDON: The British submarine Pandora (1,475 tons) sank two Italian supply ships in the central Mediterranean, each carrying 5,000 tons. (Reuters, 16th)

### Greek Army Continues to Achieve Local Victories; Albanian Opposition to Italy Spreads

ATHENS: Last night's communiqué here announced that Greek troops were very successful in local battles and captured enemy soldiers and a large number of military supplies. (Reuters, 16th)

ATHENS: An army communiqué stated that near the Greek island of Syklai (Italian-controlled, west of the Turkish coast) next to the Dodecanese Islands, an Italian submarine surfaced and fired fifty shots at a large boulder behind the island, under which a Greek gendarme was hiding and was not injured. (Associated Press, 16th)

LONDON: According to a Reuters correspondent stationed on the southern border, Albanian betrayal of the Italian side is growing daily. This movement was originally concentrated in the area between Berat and Elbasan, but now it has spread to the front and north. According to reliable sources, the last two Albanian regiments of the Italian army have been disbanded because the Italians can no longer rely on their loyalty. (Reuters, 16th)

### Gibraltar: Protecting against air raids

MADRID: According to information learned here, since the German Air Force participated in the Mediterranean air war, the British garrison in Gibraltar has taken various precautionary measures to prevent German planes from attacking. British reconnaissance planes are also constantly circling and patrolling over and near the forts. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)

### Frequent Exchange of Visits by Hungarian Officials

BUCHAREST: Hungarian Minister of Education Homan, at the invitation of the Romanian government, will come here for a visit at the beginning of next month. His main task is to conclude a Romanian-Hungarian cultural agreement. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)

BUDAPEST: Hungarian Minister of Justice Radocsay will go to Berlin on the 25th of this month to return a visit by German Minister of Justice Frank to Hungary. Radocsay will stay in Germany for several days and go to various places to inspect German judicial institutions. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)

### Rumor: Hitler Changes Strategy for Invading Britain; Short-Term Actions to Attack Ireland and Syria

LONDON: The exiled German leader Otto Strasser told an Independent French News Agency correspondent yesterday that Hitler would take action in the short term or within a few weeks. He believes Hitler will attack Ireland or Syria. Hitler has revised his offensive strategy from last year and formulated a new plan to blockade and invade Britain, with the goal of conquering Ireland. Theorists believe that Ireland is the fatal weakness of the British Empire. The Germans may send paratroopers by transport planes to land in Ireland to "defend" Ireland and resist British interference. Hitler hopes to gain a strong base for invading Britain in three days at the cost of hundreds or even thousands of aircraft. He believes the Axis powers will invade Ireland rather than attack Egypt or Gibraltar. The dangerous places that Britain should pay attention to are Ireland and Syria. (Reuters, 16th)

### British Minister of Aviation Broadcasts to the United States: Will Continue to Blockade Germany

LONDON: Minister of Aviation Cross broadcasted to the United States this morning, saying that because Britain may not be able to deal with its true enemy, Germany, with all its strength for a while, it believes it is necessary to give the Axis powers a unprecedented blow in the Mediterranean, where their weakness lies. At the same time, Britain will continue to pay attention to Germany at sea and in the air, and use blockade as a weapon. The British Imperial Army in Egypt has become the vanguard of the British offensive. The British people firmly believe that they can win, not entirely due to the lack of fighting spirit of the Italian army, but because the Italian military and economic situation is abnormal. Italy was not prepared for war, but was preparing to share the victory caused by Germany. Therefore, its army and air force are poorly equipped. Italy actually does not produce oil or coal domestically, and many metals depend on Germany. The Italian people's belief in fascist leadership has disappeared with each defeat of the Italian army. Finally, he said that Britain knows that the future will be difficult, but because everything it needs for the war can be supplied as soon as possible, people's hearts are greatly encouraged and they firmly believe that they will win the final victory alone. (Reuters, 16th)

### Patriots in Various Parts of Abyssinia Rise Up in Response to the King; Rebellion Gradually Turns into a Prairie Fire; Italy Can Hardly Control the Border Areas

KHARTOUM: The rebellion that has been brewing in Abyssinia since it was conquered by Italy five years ago is now erupting and gradually turning into a prairie fire. Abyssinian patriots are greatly excited by the news that King Haile Selassie is only a few miles outside the border. They gather in various parts of the country and act independently, constantly harassing isolated small Italian units. The Abyssinians resist together and receive supplies of various new weapons and equipment. Their message of thanks has been received. According to news received in Khartoum, King Haile Selassie's recent announcement of his determination to personally lead the patriotic army in combat has greatly intensified the activities of the Abyssinians. Leaflets containing King Haile Selassie's statements are being distributed by the British Air Force to various parts of Abyssinia. The Abyssinian resistance movement was limited to the Gojjam region on the shore of Lake Tana in northwestern Abyssinia. Now, Abyssinians in the Gallas region in the south have asked leaders in the Gojjam region to send representatives to organize anti-Italian affairs. Several Abyssinian leaders east of Lake Tana (two hundred miles northwest of the Abyssinian capital) have also successively risen up. Because the Italians are encountering intermittent resistance from the Abyssinians, they cannot control areas outside the main centers, which greatly helps the Abyssinian rebellion. Many areas are still managed by the Abyssinians themselves. A big mistake made by the Italians was destroying many Abyssinian churches and killing priests. Although Mussolini allocated huge sums of money to rebuild the churches, patriotic Abyssinians have deep hatred and are unmoved. (Reuters, 16th)

### Germany Fails to Win Czech Cooperation; Heydrich Implements Repression

LONDON: According to information from well-informed Czech sources, the Nazi attempts to win the obedience of the Czech people have failed. Therefore, Heydrich, the German governor of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, summoned civil and military officials to his residence in Prague on December 26 last year and told them that he was deeply dissatisfied with the Czech people, saying that there were no trustworthy Czechs and that the autonomous government was instigated by Beneš, which caused dissatisfaction. The efforts to win Czech cooperation cannot continue for long. If necessary, he would not hesitate to establish a military dictatorship and crush the spirit of resistance. In the new year, Heydrich has been oppressing untrustworthy Czechs, regardless of their status in society or officialdom. (Reuters, 16th)

### Unbearable Oppression by Quisling Arouses Public Anger in Norway; Clashes Occur Between the Public and Storm Troopers; Many of Those Arrested and Imprisoned in Concentration Camps

LONDON: According to news received by the London Norwegian Telegraph Agency, German attempts to promote a new order in Norway have been met with widespread resistance throughout Norway. The tyrannical methods of Quisling's storm troopers have aroused public anger among civilians, resulting in serious clashes. German storm troopers in Stavanger fought with the public in the streets, injuring several civilians. Those arrested were abused, and other civilians launched attacks. The storm troopers retaliated. Civilians seized four storm troopers and threw them into the river, but they were rescued by the Germans. The civilians then beat the storm trooper leaders. Afterwards, the Germans immediately imposed a curfew in the city. It is reported that Norwegians have been arrested in many places, including prominent figures in Bergen. The newly arrested people are constantly being sent to nearby concentration camps. Secret leaflets have been distributed in eastern Norway, calling on civilians to resist the tyranny with force. The Germans have also transported Norwegian food out of the country, resulting in a sharp reduction in Norwegian food supplies and increasing public unrest. The Germans have organized plainclothes police to deal with the distribution of anti-German posters and the eavesdropping of telephone calls by spies. The Norwegian people's hatred for Quisling and the Germans is growing stronger. German officials despise Quisling and his friends, and ignore his so-called ministers. The Germans' attitude is deliberately intended to lure anti-Quisling people in. However, the anti-German sentiment has never been stronger than it is today. There are also internal differences of opinion within the Quisling Party. Several of its ministers and party members have resigned due to dissatisfaction with the German behavior. (Reuters, 16th)

### German Planes Silent Due to Bad Weather

BERLIN: German military experts made the following war report to a Haitong News Agency correspondent: On the 14th, due to bad weather, the German Air Force only made reconnaissance flights over England, taking pictures of targets for future bombing. On the 14th, Portsmouth and Plymouth suffered heavy losses from German bombing. The British Air Force has not been very active in recent days, and has not come to German territory for reconnaissance. (Haitong News, 16th)

LONDON: Although German planes carried out air raids over some cities in the Midlands and London area last night, they did not cause significant damage. At least two German planes have been shot down by British fighters. Some of the bombs dropped in London last night were incendiary bombs, but they did not cause any damage and were extinguished immediately. Several people were injured when a house was bombed in one place. Casualties outside London were also extremely rare. Several houses were destroyed in a certain place in the Midlands.

### British Air Force Concentrates on Norway: Attacks German Airfields

LONDON: A Royal Air Force communiqué stated that the Royal Air Force continued to attack "enemy" air force bases concentrated in Norway on Tuesday. (Associated Press, 16th)

LONDON: Last night, British planes launched a fierce attack on Wilhelmshaven, the famous German naval base, virtually turning the place into a fiery hell. According to responsible sources here, the intensity of the British air raid on this place was greater than the previous thirty-nine attacks. Important military and naval targets were hit. It is generally believed that once a detailed report is received, it will be clear how heavy the losses are at this important German military activity center, and it may not be possible to restore the original working condition in a short period of time.

### Germany Cannot Control the Sea and Air: Invading Britain is Very Difficult

NEW YORK: A prominent London figure here recently said that the danger of a German invasion of Britain is actually very small. The reason why Britain has repeatedly warned its people of the danger of a German invasion is to encourage British workers and soldiers. It should be known that after the start of the war, it took the British fifteen thousand eight hundred British troops five weeks to land in France. At that time, with the assistance of the British and French navies and the world's largest merchant ships, it took so long to land. It can be seen that landing is not an easy task. The British still have an advantage at sea. As long as the Germans fail to control the sky, if the German army lands, it will inevitably suffer misfortune. It will inevitably encounter resistance from naval artillery fire, air force attacks, mine mechanized units, regular armies, and three million home guards. (Associated Press, 16th)

It is not yet known when the list of new cabinet members will be announced. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)

### Hua Troops in Northern Hubei (Jun County, Chuan County, Diandian County) Defeat Japanese Troops Attacking Chaan from Suixian; Hua Troops Recover Liancheng, Digou in Eastern Henan

CHONGQING Military News: (1) More than 2,000 Japanese troops from Suixian attacked Hua troops on the night of the 12th. One unit reached Gaomiao (south of Jun County), and Hua troops ambushed them from the front and rear near Junchuan Dian. After a fierce battle until noon on the 13th, the Japanese troops could not hold out and collapsed. Hua troops immediately recaptured Junchuan Dian. At the same time, another Japanese unit attacked Chaan from Suixian, but was severely damaged by Hua troops and retreated. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties in this battle, and Hua troops captured many prisoners, which are being counted. (2) Yingei, a professor at Ritsumeikan University in Japan and the head of the Department of Commerce, who was previously ordered to come to China to fight, was recently seriously wounded and killed in the outer suburbs of Anqing. It is said that he was a Doctor of Statistics. (3) A Japanese unit from Linkou, with one cannon attached, attacked southward on the 6th, attempting to open up transportation to Qinshui. The Japanese were ambushed by Hua troops and retreated with injuries. (4) On the afternoon of the 9th, Hua troops in eastern Henan ambushed Japanese troops retreating southeast of Liancheng, killing many Japanese. Hua troops took advantage of the victory and advanced directly to Liancheng and Digou, annihilating more than half of the Japanese. Hua troops then recaptured Liancheng, Digou, and other strongholds. (5) On the night of the 9th, Hua troops attacked the Japanese at Xixin Dian, south of Zhuxian Town. The Japanese retreated at the sight of Hua troops, and Hua troops captured Xixin Dian.

The Japanese retreated with injuries. All these units have now arrived at their destinations and continue to kill the Japanese. (Dispatch of the 16th)

CHONGQING: A certain Chinese person who recently returned here after traveling in the vicinity of the Sino-Japanese front, told an Associated Press reporter that the fighting between the Chinese and Japanese armies has been at a standstill for several months, because the Japanese army is now unable to launch an effective attack on the mountain positions held by the Chinese army, and the Chinese army, due to lack of heavy artillery, is also unable to come out and drive away the Japanese army. On January 1, the Chinese army once defeated the Japanese army's spring offensive. This Japanese offensive was launched from Tongcheng in the southern part of Hubei Province and ended on January 10 after a week of fighting. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered 4,000 casualties out of the 15,000 who participated in the war. In addition, the Japanese army attempted to attack Liantang south of Nanchang, but was defeated on January 11. Other fronts were quiet, except for the battle in Shashi on January 10. (Associated Press, 16th)

LUOYANG: On the 8th, a unit of Japanese troops from Tongxu, with two cannons attached, attacked the vicinity of Yang Erxian to the south. On the morning of the 9th, under the cover of artillery fire, they attacked Hua troops stationed at Zhashang. Due to Hua troops resisting, they were unable to succeed. In the afternoon, when the Japanese troops were retreating to Liancheng, the unit attached to Wang Tianchong was ambushed by Hua troops, killing more than 100 Japanese. The remaining Japanese troops fled into Liancheng and stubbornly defended. Hua troops then took advantage of the night to attack Liancheng and Digou, and after a fierce battle from dawn on the 10th, they killed and wounded many Japanese, and captured the two strongholds. The remaining Japanese troops fled in panic towards Tongxu. (Dispatch of the 16th)

### Thai Troops Continue to Advance in Vietnam; Several Vietnamese Fortifications Reportedly Destroyed; French Chargé d'Affaires in Bangkok Visits Thai Foreign Ministry

Bangkok: The sounds of artillery fire from the Thai-Vietnamese border were clearly audible yesterday, lasting throughout the day. Local sources say that the Vietnamese side is suffering from a shortage of ammunition, with seven out of ten shells fired falling short. Several artillery positions have also been reportedly destroyed. Thai military reports indicate that the army, with the cooperation of the air force, is continuing its advance. (Reuters, 15th)

Bangkok: Yesterday's news stated that the French Chargé d'Affaires in Bangkok, Mr. Garreau, visited the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday for a forty-minute meeting with the leadership. Well-informed sources believe that the discussions involved an exchange of views on the events along the Thai-Vietnamese border. (United Press, 16th)

Tokyo: According to Japanese sources, the Thai-Vietnamese conflict has expanded to new areas in recent days. The two governments appear to have significantly different opinions on the fundamental conditions for compromise, preventing a peaceful resolution to the border conflict. According to reports from Hanoi, Thai troops crossed the southwestern border of Laos on the 13th of this month, invading the areas of Pakse and Bassac. The following day, infantry units, supported by aircraft, attacked the town of Bassac. Thai troops also engaged Vietnamese forces elsewhere and encroached upon the southwestern border of Cambodia. According to Japanese sources in Bangkok, although Franco-Thai diplomatic relations remain normal, the Thai government insists on the acceptance of its demands as a condition for ceasing border hostilities. Despite the newly appointed French Consul General to Thailand, Mr. Garreau, arriving in Bangkok around November last year, he was only able to present his credentials on January 6th. Although the envoy has repeatedly visited the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, radio broadcasts from Bangkok and Saigon have stated that both governments desire a peaceful resolution to the border conflict. However, negotiations have reportedly made little concrete progress to date. The Thai government insists that France must fully acknowledge its previous demands. Only then will Thailand ratify the non-aggression pact agreed to by both countries on June 12th of last year. These demands are: (1) that the Mekong River be the boundary between the two countries; and (2) that France return to Thailand the areas of Nong Khai and Bassac, which France acquired in 1907. Once France acknowledges these demands, the Thai government intends to send representatives to participate in boundary demarcation meetings. However, the French government is only willing to discuss the issue of the Mekong River as the boundary and refuses to cede territory. (Reuters, 16th)

Hanoi: Neutral observers recently stated that the Japanese troops in Hanoi and Haiphong have become increasingly arrogant. It is said that Japanese sentries stationed at the Haiphong docks have been successively entering foreign-owned warehouses. This morning, Japanese soldiers were also seen patrolling the streets of Hanoi on motorcycles. (United Press, 16th)

Bangkok: Thai radio recently stated that French forces appear to have exhausted their military supplies. It is said that most of the French artillery shells are old. (United Press, 16th)

Tokyo: This morning, major newspapers here unanimously discussed the developments in Southeast Asia. Hochi Shimbun stated that the strategy of the United Kingdom and the United States aims to restrain Vietnam and Thailand, thereby obstructing Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and warned the people of both countries to quickly prepare for defense. Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that Japan's Co-Prosperity Sphere cannot be separated from the liberation of the South Asian peoples, including the Dutch East Indies, Siam, and Burma, and that Franco-Japanese talks in Tokyo should be completed quickly. Any further delay risks allowing a third party to take advantage and operate in the shadows. Tokyo newspapers also view the news of renewed trade between Vietnam and Hong Kong as evidence of a tacit understanding with the United States. Asahi Shimbun stated that goods urgently needed in Haiphong are now being imported continuously from Hong Kong and Macau, making it clear that the United Kingdom is orchestrating everything behind the Vietnamese government's back. This would never have been possible without cooperation between Vietnam and the United Kingdom. Miyako Shimbun fears that the United Kingdom and the United States are employing cunning schemes in the Thai-Vietnamese dispute. Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the United States is currently taking advantage of this chaotic situation. The newspaper also fears the expansion of Tegal's influence into Vietnam to curb Japanese advances there. In an editorial, Nichi Nichi Shimbun reiterated the need to promptly implement a more vigorous Southern Expansion Policy, stating that the issue of the feelings of the oppressed people of Vietnam is the key to Japan's entire Southern Advance Policy. The time for discussing Japan's policy of advancing into Southwest Asia is now over; the focus should be on implementation rather than discussion. The implementation of Japan's policy toward Vietnam is closely related to the 23 million natives who are oppressed by 30,000 Frenchmen. These natives have not only lost their natural freedom and happiness, but their race is also deteriorating daily as a result of French oppression. Franco-Japanese negotiations will ultimately be resolved in Japan's favor, but conducting these negotiations in peacetime should not waste time on empty talk. The decline of French power in Vietnam will increase the arrogance of the Tegal faction. If that happens, not only will Japan's influence in Vietnam be unsustainable, but Japan's efforts to build a new order in that part of Asia will also fail. The newspaper also mentioned that the Dutch East Indies is increasingly controlled economically by the United Kingdom and the United States. The defenses of Hong Kong and Singapore are becoming increasingly solid. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that Japan is now completely surrounded by the spheres of influence of the United Kingdom and the United States. (Reuters, 16th)

### Foreign Observers Discuss Japan's Future

Chongqing: According to a thesis published yesterday by a certain foreign observer, Japan's invasion of China and attempts to advance southward are planned actions. However, various obstacles have made it difficult to realize its wishes. The thesis states: "Japan's feeling of discomfort about the rashly launched invasion of China in July 1937 is now becoming increasingly apparent. Originally, Japan was a country that imitated modern nations' political systems. Thanks to its planned economic system and predetermined expansion policies, it leaped from a small country to a first-class power. After the last World War, Japan gained many benefits, leading to a prosperous market, expanded markets, and a dramatic increase in population, which led to the issue of expanding territory. This problem is not new; since 1260, Japan has attempted to invade China proper and Korea, and later extended to the South Sea. In 1893, the people of Shanghai built city walls to defend against foreign enemies, and the invaders were driven out the following year. In the second half of the 16th century, Japanese commercial adventurers traded southward, coming into contact with the Spanish authorities in the Philippines. In 1628, Japan built a colony of 8,000 people in Siam, playing a significant political role there. Eastern Cambodia and the Dutch East Indies were also invaded at that time. This success aroused Toyotomi Hideyoshi's ambition to invade Korea and conquer China. His boast is said to have been as follows: 'Kyushu is ours. If you can allocate me one year's income from that island, I can build ships, stockpile military supplies, and take Korea. After conquering Korea, I ask you to grant it to me as a reward. Then I can proceed to conquer other places, because with the Korean army, coupled with your illustrious prestige, I can conquer China. If it can be completed, then the three countries can be united.'" (To be continued) (Dispatch, 16th)

### The Causes and Consequences of Italy's Defeat

This piece is a record from the New York Times of the 8th of last month, now translated below. From a military point of view, a general who has worked hard but achieved nothing must step aside to make way for the capable. There are many precedents in history. General Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, Chief of the German Army Staff, no longer held military power after his major defeat in the Battle of the Marne in 1914. British Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal French was also recalled to his country after his defeat in the Battle of Loos in 1915. General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the Anglo-French Allied Forces, was replaced immediately after the German army broke through the Allied lines in May last year. Lieutenant General Gort, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, was rarely mentioned after the British Army's retreat from Dunkirk, France. Recently, General Badoglio, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, was also dismissed for his failed conquest of Greece.

General Badoglio is sixty-nine years old. He has been in the military since childhood and has participated in several important battles. If the Italian army had not been completely defeated, his military power would not have been abruptly revoked. He has always been a royalist and not a premierist. He is indeed a soldier, not a politician. He once opposed Italy's participation in the war, and he is said to have been unenthusiastic about Mussolini's policies. His downfall can only be said to be taking the blame for others.

When the Italian army crossed the Albanian border and invaded the Greek mountains, both friends and enemies of Greece expected the Italian army to win quickly. However, the winter climate in the Balkan Peninsula is cold, and the snow on the Pindus Mountains of Greece hinders the march. The Greek army seized the opportunity to counterattack, driving the enemy out of the country and taking advantage of the victory to rush into Albanian territory.

There are many reasons for Italy's defeat. One reason is that the Greek rainy season turns mountain valleys into mud, preventing Italian tanks from moving. Another reason is that the Greek army gathered on the peaks, looking down and using artillery to cut off the Italian army's transportation lines, causing them to collapse. A third reason is that the Italian Army Staff was not adequately prepared and morale was low. A fourth reason is that the Greek Air Force received assistance from the English Allied Air Force, greatly increasing its strength, which made the Italian army's situation even more difficult. At the same time, the British fleet prevented Italy from sending troops and military supplies to Abyssinia for reinforcement. When the Italian army retreated, Mussolini reassigned General Soddu to Albania to take command. Currently, the Italian army is still retreating.

The Greek convoy has now occupied the Albanian seaport of Aida, which has a population of only 2,000 but a long history. During the last European War, it served as a naval base for Italy. The port was originally named Santi Quaranta. Since Italy annexed Albania in 1939, Mussolini renamed the port after his eldest daughter in memory of his eldest daughter, and the town's main street was also renamed Via Emanuele in memory of the King of Italy.

The loss of Aida Port has caused the Italian army in southern Albania to lose its landing point, forcing it to land at Vlora Port, eighty-one miles to the north. The Anglo-Greek joint air force was originally not easy to exert its power, but in this way, Vlora Port became a ready-made bombing target. (To be continued)

### Finance: Frenzied Buying Spree Attacks Foreign Exchange Market; HSBC Quotes Relatively Reduced; Tense Spot and Forward Markets Unusually Different from Normal Days

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's quote did not change for the first time. The second announcement at 2:35 PM saw the British exchange rate shrink by 125, counting 3 pence and 1/8th at 3 shillings and 2/1875. The US exchange rate shrunk by 3/1875, counting 5.125 yuan. There were no markets for French and German currencies, and the remaining currencies also shrank accordingly, causing rumors of speculation. The tense situation in the black market for British and US exchange rates suddenly intensified. However, the environment was without stimulation, purely due to the speculative trick of stirring up trouble and frantically hoarding. Moreover, it was slightly hard at the beginning of the morning. In particular, it is said that HSBC and Mercantile sold a large amount of sterling, reaching over 400,000 pounds. After 10:00 AM, there were quite a few settlements for foreign rice and foreign cotton, and speculators also began to purchase and settle, and the US exchange rate was quite tight. In the afternoon, the spot US exchange rate had reached 5.4375 yuan. Later in the day, the speculative hoarding became more intense, with new long positions emerging, and forward needs were the highest and unusually sought after. The February US exchange rate had been done at 5.25 yuan, but the evening situation was chaotic, and the price shrank again. The closing spot British exchange rate was very much at 3 shillings and 3/1875, and the US exchange rate was at 5.28125 yuan, which was 1/125 and 2/1875 smaller than the previous day. The February rate and the spot rate opened by 0/03125 and 0/0625.

Situation Changed After 9:30 AM

In the early morning, since there were no telegrams from overseas bank markets, the exchange rates for British, US, and Shanghai were all flat. The US, British, and Shanghai rates also did not change. The central government's posted rates for various currencies remained the same. The banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning: British currency was at 3 shillings and 3/46875, and the US exchange rate was at 5.46875 yuan, which was flat for the British currency and 0/03125 softer for the US currency compared to the previous day's closing, because the potential had already been positive after the closing the previous day. After opening, British banks such as HSBC and Mercantile supplied a lot of sterling, with foreign banks and other speculators reportedly taking in a total of about 400,000 pounds of spot goods. The price hardened slightly, with most transactions being at 3 shillings and a half. HSBC's posted exchange rate did not change, and the silver tax was also flat. Not long after, around 9:45 AM, foreign firms suddenly made settlements, coupled with speculators bravely buying in, although US and Chinese banks were willing to provide, the market had already reported tightening. It is estimated that foreign firms and speculators moved the US exchange rate for this month from 5 and a half yuan to 4/375. By noon, speculators came out slightly to cover. It is estimated that foreign firms moved the speculators' US exchange rate for this month back to 5.46875 yuan. The closing spot British currency was at 3 shillings and 3/46875, and the US exchange rate was again reported at 5.4375 yuan, but it was still easy to settle.

Forward Needs Surprisingly High in the Afternoon

In the afternoon, US banks first supplied speculators with the US exchange rate for this month at 5.4375 yuan. Soon, speculators' needs were surprisingly high, and the number of accounts decreased. Forward needs were particularly strong. It is estimated that foreign firms released the speculators' US exchange rate for next month at 5.25 yuan.

### Amidst a Frenzy of Speculation, Gold Market Experiences Unprecedented Surge, Reaching a High of $6,810

Yesterday's gold market saw a scorching red, with an alarming upward trend intensifying. It successively broke through two major milestones of $6,700 and $6,800, approaching the $6,900 mark. Sentiment was extremely firm across the board, driven by tightening foreign exchange and reduced trading volume, sparking certain rumors that further fueled the buying frenzy.

The market opened relatively stable in the morning, with foreign exchange slightly strengthening due to supply from British and American commercial banks. Selling pressure from securities firms and money houses pushed the price down to a low of $6,590, a drop of $50. However, news soon emerged of tightening foreign exchange amid import and speculative buying. Although the tightening was limited, buying momentum from gold firms and another securities firm surged, sending the price to around $6,700 before stalling and moving sideways.

In the afternoon, both official and unofficial foreign exchange tightened, removing any concerns for buyers. Tiancheng, Hengji, Xinfengxiang, Xingyong, Gongda, and large remittance firms frantically absorbed gold, leaving sellers helpless. The price soared again, reaching a high of $6,880 before slightly retreating to $6,845, a remarkable increase of $245. Based on the closing price of US$5.21875 for February delivery, the adjusted price was $6,695, a rise of $150.

Total trading volume for the day reached 15,000 taels. Swap buyers offered a premium of $200 with no counterparties. Cash was trading $125 lower than term delivery in the morning, with Tongfengheng selling 20 taels to Baocheng Gongji. In the afternoon, sellers had to deliver at the term delivery price, while buyers demanded a $100 discount, creating extreme confusion. Jewelry gold rose by $30, reaching $690. Customs gold and other items remained stable.

Scorching Red: Up $245

The market opened at 9:15 AM at $6,605 per bar (ten taels), $5 higher than the previous afternoon's closing price. A flurry of buying immediately pushed the price up to $6,640. News that US dollars could be settled at $5.50 led to frantic selling from Tongkang and Baokang, creating a temporary lull. The price briefly retreated by $50 to within $6,600, reaching a low of $6,590. However, aggressive buying from gold firm Dadecheng and a silver firm, Yilidefu, along with tightening foreign exchange due to import and speculative buying, and retail investors joining the fray, quickly propelled the price up by $160, breaking through the $6,600 and $6,700 milestones and reaching $6,750.

However, the tightening of foreign exchange was minimal. Dadecheng resumed selling, and Xinyuan Silver Firm also joined in. The market softened to around $6,700, retreating to $6,685. Remittance firms pushed the price up again to $6,720 before another dip at noon. The afternoon closing price was $6,695.

The market opened at 2 PM amidst buying momentum, with the price already exceeding $6,700, opening $25 higher at $6,720. It continued to rise to $6,730. Baokang and Tongkang sold, while Hengji also sold, pushing the price back to $6,710.

News of tightening foreign exchange and reduced trading volume further strengthened sentiment. Tiancheng, Xinfeng, Gongda, Hengji, Xiangxing, and Yong all bought, driving the price up by $155, reaching $6,865. Profit-taking by long positions caused a temporary retreat to $6,790. As foreign exchange tightened further, with the US dollar settling at only $5.25, buying momentum surged again, pushing the price up by another $90 to a peak of $6,880 before a slight retreat. The market closed at 4 PM at $6,845, a further increase of $245 compared to the previous day's afternoon closing price.

It has been rising for four consecutive days (excluding swaps), with a total increase of $442. After the close, it retreated slightly to $6,830, with a daily fluctuation of $290. The gold market price of the gold firms have no definite market price, roughly $50 lower than the term delivery price. The purchase price is $70 lower than the selling price. Spot gold has no market price.

Jewelry Gold in Silver Shops Also Sees Three Consecutive Major Jumps
The selling price of jewelry gold in silver shops rose by $30 per tael, initially quoted at $660, then rising $10 at 10:30 AM, another $10 at 2:30 PM, and finally another $10 at 3:30 PM, reaching $690. The purchase price was reduced by $30.

### Food: Imported Rice Takes Advantage of the Situation to Rise Again; Large Quantities of Arriving Rice, New Orders also Reach 100,000 Bags

Recently, imported rice experienced consecutive small declines, with the lowest price dropping by about $10 from its peak. Unexpectedly, this triggered a large sales volume. Yesterday, the upward trend was particularly strong, with prices for all types of imported rice rising by more than $2 abruptly compared to the previous market. This was due to rumors of Vietnam and Thailand refusing to cease hostilities, leading to widespread speculation and a surge of panic in the market. On the buying side, there was a rush to acquire rice, creating a chaotic market. Sellers seized the opportunity to raise prices, and quotes rose steadily amidst continuous bidding.

Xiaojiao rice, with its relatively low price, was particularly popular. It rose from $70.50 in the early market to $75 near noon. No. 1 Saigon rose from $84 to $86, Zhongguan No. 2 from $77 to $79, and higher-grade varieties opened at $81.50 at the limit line. Subsequently, the upward trend subsided, and there were no changes until closing. Other varieties such as No. 1 Siam were at $85, medium grade at $82, Huojiao at $84.70 to $83, Milu at $68.50 to $67.50, Suijian at $65 to $61.50, and Wuhujian at $76.50. Futures were particularly favored for hoarding, with prices rising by $2-3.

However, amidst the high market prices, a large number of new deals were suddenly concluded, leading to a subsequent stabilization in the market. New transactions totaled more than 100,000 bags, with Jianyuan selling 7,000 tons of February Xiaojiao at $81, Dafu selling 3,200 tons at $81.70, and Heyi selling 400 tons of No. 1 Saigon at $89.90. Close to 1,000 tons of original package rice were also resold, with Saigon No. 1 for January at $94.5, Xiaojiao for December 9th shipment at $89.90, January at $84, and February at $83. Since the fixed price for February delivery was only $81-82, there was a lack of trading for resold February contracts. Current imported rice transactions still amounted to 8,000-9,000 bags.

Domestic rice, such as Houbo Geng, saw limited supply continuation. With imported rice surging, sentiment unanimously turned bullish. Not only was demand strong from shops and stomachs, but sellers were also very firm in their selling intentions. Therefore, under these dual circumstances, all prices increased by another $1-2. Changbang Tejing was quoted at $108 to $106, Kunshan Hu saw Baijing quoted at $104 to $101, and secondary at $99. Qingjiao Hu saw Bodao quoted at $97-98.

Glutinous rice sales were weak in the morning but yesterday's holiday was good, stimulating interest from wine shops, cake shops, and food vendors, who took advantage of the low prices. As a result, the market turned lively, and sellers were looking to raise prices. However, there were no significant gains or losses in prices, with the situation only appearing slightly tighter. Kaiyi Baimi Liyuan was still at $90, Hong Kong Baimi was at a high of $78, $77, and secondary was around $75.

Continuous arrivals of imported rice have been reported in this column. It is now learned that another three ships carrying rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Qingyuan arrived from Hong Kong with 12,301 bags, docking at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading yesterday afternoon. In addition, the Java Company's Zhishaluya and Jardine Matheson's Fusheng also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon with imported rice. The exact quantities are unknown as they docked at the Huashun wharf in Hongkou and the Lanyancong wharf in Pudong. Details will be reported after further investigation today. (Zu)

### Flour Market Firm

The flour market saw particular firmness yesterday. In terms of sales, in addition to local needs, buying interest from northern merchants was also strong. It was reported that a ship carrying Australian flour under the "Huabiao" and "Zhonglou" brands was intercepted en route from Hong Kong, causing a brief surge in the market. However, this news has not been confirmed, so the situation is unlikely to overdo it. The opening price in the morning was $23.90 to $23.85. Subsequently, with the sharp rise in gold and rice prices, the price was raised by $0.1-0.2. "Yezhu" and "Meili" brands both required $24, while Hong Kong "Lanmaihuabiao" brand required $23.75. Total transactions were over 7,000 bags. Local flour was still sold at $21.50, with 4,096 bags sold by the two factories.

Wheat trading remained firm. Factories run by the Japanese were only able to get some shipments at the gate and did not attempt to corner the wheat. Chinese factories are not doing well, while the wheat market is priced at $26-27 without market. According to visitors from the mainland, prices in Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Kunshan are all expensive, and miscellaneous expenses are high. Transportation risks are high, and various industries are closing down for the New Year. Therefore, the wheat market will not be able to expand this year.

### Cotton Yarn and Cotton: Speculating Based on the Gold Market, Cotton Yarn Advances to New Highs; "Shuangma" Trades at $1,450

The yarn market remained firm due to the rise in gold prices and tightening foreign exchange, leading to a universally bullish sentiment. Although actual transactions were as stagnant as a wooden chicken, the public speculated up and down based on the gold price, and speculative buyers were unusually excited. The market gradually advanced to new highs. The high price of 20-count "Shuangma" reached $1,443, and the low price was $1,426. In the afternoon, with the continued strength of spot gold, the market sentiment was revived, trading from $1,437 to $1,448, with the final price at $1,450. The factory Yong'an Factory offered 750 bales of 10-count "Te Jin Cheng" at $960 and 450 bales of 10-count "Jiahe" at $850. Today, 11 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen and 445 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

"Shuangma" opened in the morning carrying on the bullish sentiment from the previous afternoon. The opening price was $1,430. The market was still flat initially, falling to $1,425, due to the stability of foreign exchange and gold prices. News of rising spot gold revived buying sentiment, and "Shengda" and "Jinzi" helped by buying, gradually rising to $1,443. However, actual business was sluggish, and gains were given back, falling back to close at $1,430. It is estimated that the total transactions in the half-day were 6,505 bales. The amount bought by each group is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 200, Colleagues 6,300

Ningbo 5 Total 6,505

### Cotton Follows Suit and Improves

The spot cotton market is rising along with the yarn market. 32-count and 42-count raw materials are relatively firm. 20-count raw materials are less competitive because the Indian price is still cheaper. However, sentiment is also bullish.

A large batch of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai. The British Company's Elipura arrived yesterday afternoon, bringing a large amount of cotton from Mumbai, totaling over 7,400 tons, amounting to more than 29,000 pieces. It docked at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading.

In other news, the price of foreign cotton in New York Cotton Market were firm. First, speculators bought, followed by public bidding, and an increase in the number of units from domestic factories. Thus, the closing price was more than ten pound points higher than the previous day. The Indian market was flat.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, the shrinkage of exchange rates and the surge in yarn prices has made all parties enthusiastic about purchasing raw cotton, and a few factories are also happy to move. However, the general hand-holders are unwilling to sell, so although cotton prices were high yesterday, there were not many transactions.

### Securities: Although Domestic Bonds Are Under Pressure, the Future is Still Bullish; Foreign Stocks Experience a Major Surge

The unofficial market for public bonds was relatively quiet yesterday. However, the potential of both buyers and sellers is still bullish. Currently, the Lunar New Year is approaching, and rumors are rampant, putting a lot of pressure on the market, resulting in sideways movement. The emergence of long positions from Nos. 25 and Xinfu Yuxing yesterday failed to suppress the market price, as Shunchang Tongkang continued to buy aggressively. No. 16 also saw some repurchases, and Hongda's appetite was also strong. Others such as Hengfu Lianhe and Runde also bought. Although Lemao Jiufeng Yitai and Dingkang supplied a lot, the price remained firm. As a result, highs and lows were seen, with only a difference of $0.05-$0.1. The number of transactions was estimated to be over $2 million, and the market was not quiet. A summary table is listed below.

In stock trading, ten shares of Guanshengyuan were traded at a price of $70.

The stock market in the Public Industry Association is still very firm. Although there was a lot of profit-taking, buyers absorbed the selling pressure. Several stocks briefly reached new highs not seen since May of last year. In the early afternoon, the trend became exceptionally firm due to tightening foreign exchange. However, the upward trend failed to continue, undoubtedly due to an excessive number of long positions recently. However, the prices of various stocks fell only slightly. The current market seems to be following the foreign exchange market, moving up and down. Rubber stocks also rose slightly.

London, 15th (Wednesday) - Today's listings for Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British company stocks remained flat. Only HSBC Bank shares rose by £1 each, with London-registered shares at £81 and Hong Kong-registered shares at £83, with no other movements.

### Silk and Tea: Attempting to Monopolize the World Silk Market by Strengthening Control, Shanghai Silk Exports are Blocked

Recently, the silk market in Shanghai has been very quiet. This is because a certain party has strengthened control, and all raw silk is not allowed to be inspected without the permission of a certain department. As a result, local factories cannot obtain export certificates. Foreign firms cannot sell goods because raw silk cannot be exported. Each customer also cannot sell, which means that foreign firms sales outlets were blocked, so the silk industry has almost stopped for several days. However, there are now some scattered transactions, which can only be sold to those who hold export certificates.

Since the "Inspection Bureau" stopped public measurement, the balance between production and sales has been lost. According to the overseas silk market, each load is worth a total of 5,300 yuan in national currency, while domestic silk prices are declining. For example, the price per load in the Suzhou, Hangzhou and Wuxi areas is only about 2,600-2,700 yuan, the huge difference is a record in the history of the silk industry.

The purpose of tightening control in this way is to control the entire Chinese silk industry and put all production institutions on the road to extinction, in order to monopolize the entire world silk market.

### Piece Goods: Hoarding Piece Goods Becomes Extremely Popular Again

The city market for factory cloth cloth was flat at first but then rose.

### Roosevelt to be Inaugurated Next Week; Shanghai American Community Celebrates Enthusiastically; Roosevelt Takes Emergency Measures in the Far East; Chinese Express Infinite Respect

Since President Roosevelt became the master of the White House for the third time, the American community in Shanghai believes that Roosevelt is talented and outstanding. This re-election as president is easy to get used to, and he will definitely be able to cope well with the current crisis. Therefore, everyone is excited and comforted, looking forward to the country's future and increasing unlimited hope. It is learned that next Monday (20th) is the official inauguration date of President Roosevelt. American community groups in Shanghai, such as the American Association, the American Women's Association, and the American General Association, believe that this day is closely related to world history, and specially prepare to celebrate it. However, due to the extraordinary times, it is planned to be held in private. However, the enthusiasm for celebration is no less than that of a public ceremony.

Third Inauguration Unprecedented

President Luo has quite laborious government affairs, especially since mid-December. However, the president actually has amazing recovery abilities. Although the president sometimes feels tired, he can recover after resting for one or two days in Hyde Park or the hot springs. All the streets in Washington are hung with lights and decorations in preparation for celebrating the unprecedented third inauguration ceremony in American history. Thirty governors have decided to attend the ceremony, as have other senior government officials from the National Defense Committee and others, to participate in the grand event. On this day, President Roosevelt will ride a horse through Pennsylvania Avenue to show his healthy body. The celebration ceremony will officially begin on Sunday evening. The inauguration ceremony will be held at Constitution Hall, and the program will include performances by radio, stage, and screen stars, as well as performances by the National Orchestra. It is believed that the American community in Shanghai will also have a grand celebration on this day.

Not Afraid of Intimidation, Preparing for the Worst

The Millard Review reported that due to President Weissfu's plan to provide unlimited assistance to the United Kingdom, Japan was greatly frightened and made false threats. This kind of intimidation has prompted the United States to prepare for the war in the Western Pacific. In addition to withdrawing American women and children from the Far East, the recent developments have also strengthened the strength of the American fleet to deal with the Japanese Navy, and put the Pacific and Asian fleets in a state of war. They have also accelerated the establishment of Pacific naval bases to prevent further deterioration of US-Japan relations. On the 8th of this month, President Roosevelt appointed Rear Admiral Jinmaier as the commander-in-chief of the US fleet, and US Secretary of the Navy Knox stated that the US fleet will be divided into three divisions: the Pacific Fleet, the Asian Fleet, and the Dog Atlantic Fleet. Submarine expert General He De will continue to be the commander of the Asian Fleet, and Rear Admiral Jin will command the Atlantic Fleet. The United Kingdom and the United States have also negotiated to enable the United States to use British bases in the Pacific. In addition, the budget recently submitted to Congress by President Roosevelt has explained the definite intention of the United States. Therefore, this budget requires the expansion of defenses in the Pacific, including Guam, the Philippine Islands, and Hawaii.

### American Warship Patrol

The US Navy Asian Fleet's gunboat Luzon, stationed in Shanghai, went on patrol on the 4th of this month and returned to Shanghai on the 8th. Yesterday afternoon at about 2 pm, it suddenly set anchor again and left Wusongkou at 4:10 pm for a cruise along the Yangtze River.

### Methods to Improve Treatment in Various Industries; Labor Awaiting Reply; Car Workers' Strike Satisfactorily Resolved; Some Barbers Still Not Back to Work

The dispute between the staff and drivers of the four major taxi companies, Xiang Sheng, Yunfei, Yinse, and Tailai, over improving treatment has come to an end, because the management has agreed to subsidize the staff and drivers with 18 yuan each, rice subsidy of 24 yuan, bonus for two months, and an additional two cents per day for each driver, totaling six yuan per month. Therefore, the labor considers it satisfactory, and the strike was quelled.

Postal Workers and Messengers

The Post Office Administration and all its branches' postal workers and messengers requested that the year-end bonus include all living allowances and that a living index allowance of 21 yuan be issued, based on the multiplier of the Public Works Department's living index. They received a reply from the Kunming General Administration on the 11th of this month, approving the principle. Detailed methods have not yet been received, so all postal workers are waiting consistently. As for the rumors that "Post Office Employee Bonus" has been approved by the General Administration by 75% and scheduled to be officially issued on the 21st of this month, the Post Office has denied it.

Commercial Press

More than 500 staff members of the Commercial Press made a request to the management at the end of last year to improve their treatment, but it has not been resolved. Now they have put forward five final conditions and are still waiting for a response. The management pays great attention to the livelihoods of its employees. If the management can make concessions, it is not difficult to approach it. The staff of the museum also maintain their integrity and do not have any other issues.

Various Barber Shops

Barbers in the central district of the Public Concession went on strike previously in order to request improved treatment and the abolition of the past 30/70 split system to be changed to 40/60. This spread to the French Concession. There, some barbershop windows were destroyed by strikers. The French police captured more than 40 people in Belle Road and elsewhere on the previous two days, and sent them all to the police station, where they were sentenced to 24 hours of detention in each location. The labor side has not yet requested mediation from the political department of the police station. In the Public Concession at 2:30 pm yesterday, a large number of striking barbers swarmed into the Faji barber shop at 288 Haifang Road, preventing work and destroying a piece of glass. The Gordon Road Police Station sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene, arrested Xue Wenli, Liu Fusheng, and 35 others, and took them to the police station. They were sent to the Criminal Division 8 of the First Special Court this morning. Police lawyer Peng Qiqi prosecuted for hindering freedom. And Ding Shishi, the housewife of Faji barber shop, did not want to pursue the damaged glass. After questioning the defendants, Judge Dai sentenced Xue Wenli and 36 others to ten days of detention, which could be commuted to a fine of two yuan per day, with a three-year suspended sentence. Barber Wang Baoshan, Zhu Bolin and others went to the newly opened Datong barber shop at 491 Connaught Road yesterday afternoon to prevent work, and 17 people including Wang were arrested by the Gordon Road police. They were also sent to the Special Court this morning, and Judge Dai sentenced them to the same sentence as the previous case after questioning.

HSBC Shop Assistants

Shop assistants at the British-owned HSBC Bank on the Bund, in view of the soaring prices of all commodities and the difficulty in maintaining their livelihood, made many requests to the bank's manager the day before yesterday afternoon, requesting an increase in living salaries. As there was no definite answer until yesterday morning, they went on strike. Western messengers and messengers also joined at the same time, so the number of strikers reached more than 100. However, Chinese and Western staff still worked as usual.

### New Miscellaneous Banknotes Difficult to Promote; Japanese Military Ticket Zone Builds Separate Barriers

Dazhong News Agency reported that the English-language Financial Commercial Report said that "The opening of the Reserve Bank has become a topic of general discussion. Although the 'Shanghai Branch' has not opened, a small number of 'new banknotes' have been found on the market. The printing work of the Tokyo Printing Bureau is indeed commendable, because the 'new banknotes' are quite exquisite in terms of printing, and their form is very similar to the Central Legal Currency, but this cannot arouse the sympathy and love of the people. Now all sectors want to understand how much the 'bank' has in reserve, but very little information of this kind has been obtained.

Intending to Arbitrage

It is also reported that the Shanghai market's views on "new banknotes" can be summarized in the following two points: (1) The issuance of new banknotes is just a means of raising funds. (2) Make every effort to exchange legal tender, and then use legal tender to buy foreign exchange. Initially, the Japanese military authorities opposed these "new banknotes," but now it has been heard that they have obtained the consent of the Japanese military department, but only to the extent that they do not circulate in the Japanese military ticket area.

Unable to Promote

It is reported that the "court" in the French Concession under control will declare "new banknotes" to be legal currency, and it is said that a small number of them have been used in the Concession area, but in fact it is the opposite. Because the public's attitude is firm, it is very difficult to promote "new banknotes." Even in the occupied areas, the general public immediately uses the "new banknotes" to the "issuing bank" after receiving them.

### Public Banquet Tonight: Dr. Baker

It is understood that this grand welcome event has been scheduled to take place tonight at the Hong Mian Restaurant. Participating organizations include the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Shanghai Office of the Red Cross Society of China, the First Refugee Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross, the Chinese YMCA, the Chinese YWCA, the China International Famine Relief Commission, the Shanghai Bankers Association, the Guangdong Compatriots in Shanghai Relief Fund for the Guangdong and Guangxi Refugees Donation Committee, the Guangdong Compatriots Association in Shanghai, the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, the China Moral Endeavor Association, the Xin Pu Yu Tang Orphanage, the Nanjing International Relief Committee, the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, the Ningbo Native Place Association, the Fujian Relief Association, the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association, the Joint Relief Association of Shanghai Charitable Organizations, the Relief Committee for Refugees in War Zones, the Refugee Relief Branch of the Joint Relief Association of Shanghai Charitable Organizations, Shanghai Hospital, the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education and Welfare Home, the Shanghai Children's Hospital, the Shanghai YMCA, the Shanghai YWCA, the Shanghai Sino-Western Friendship Association, the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association, the Shanghai Taiwan Disaster Relief Committee, the World Red Swastika Society, and other charitable groups.

### Silk and Satin Supply Cut Off: "Special Tax" Heavy, Suddenly "Prohibited" from Exporting; Prices Skyrocket, Silk Shops to Close Early

Since the establishment of the so-called "Silk Construction Special Tax Office," the tax on all raw silk in the city, starting from the autumn season of December 1st last year, has been implemented according to the new "standard" prices set by the "Office," classified by grade, and reported for tax. It is noted that previously, the tax on raw silk was 110 yuan per dan, but now, due to the "Construction Tax," it has increased by 370 yuan, totaling a massive 480 yuan per dan, more than

Tripling the previous amount.

Although the prices of various silk fabrics in the shops have also increased proportionally to the cost, due to the soaring prices of daily necessities, some citizens are unable to afford this nearly luxurious silk and satin, and sales have plummeted. After being severely threatened, the shops, due to the sluggish business, will implement early closures. It is reported that since the day before yesterday, the price of various silk fabrics per foot in the city has suddenly

Risen by five or six jiao

or more. According to industry insiders, most of the silk and satin in the city comes from Shengze in Suzhou, Pinghu in Zhejiang, and other places. Famous shops have branches or contracting procurement in these areas. Since the implementation of the "Construction Special Tax," although the tax was heavy, the source had not been interrupted. However, for some unknown reason, exports from the production areas have suddenly been prohibited, so no silk cloth has been shipped to the city in recent days, causing prices to skyrocket. Fortunately, the traditional Lunar New Year is approaching, so they are

Implementing early closures.

### Foreign Rice Rises to Price Limit; Food for the People Becomes Increasingly Tense: Who is to Blame?

Yesterday, under the manipulation of speculators in the rice market, the highest price of foreign rice rose again to the limit price of 87 yuan per shi. Three days ago, when the price of rice fell to three or four yuan lower than the limit price, all sectors hoped that the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee would quickly lower the price of rice according to the market price. However, before the Rice Evaluation Committee had even considered the issue, speculators gradually pushed the price back up to the limit price, causing the people's food supply to become tense again.

Urgent Measures Needed

The authorities of the two concessions have adopted strict punitive measures to stabilize the rice market, but they can only stabilize the rice market temporarily. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities can select a permanent stabilization method to achieve a lasting solution and ensure that the people's food supply is not a cause for concern. The urgent actions needed are: (1) Investigate the rice warehouses within the concessions, and if necessary, purchase rice at the cost price plus a prescribed profit of 5%, and then distribute it to the rice shops for retail sale, so that speculators lose their speculative object. (2) Continue to strictly investigate business operations in the rice market to prevent [speculators] from using old tricks. (3) Stipulate the amount of commission that rice brokers should receive to avoid confusion in transaction prices.

### Vietnamese Authorities Agree to Return Detained Shanghai Goods; Result of Gossamer's Mediation with Vietnam; However, Some Goods Have Been Confiscated by Customs

According to yesterday's news from Vietnam, after the interruption of the Vietnam Railway, the Vietnamese authorities have agreed in principle to return a large batch of goods originally blocked at the Yunnan-Vietnam border by Shanghai export merchants. The total value of the goods is approximately several million yuan. However, the exact date of return has not yet been announced. Representatives of Shanghai export merchants are still in continued negotiations with the Vietnamese Customs authorities. It is learned that after the closure of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the Chinese United Association of Hanoi requested the return of the blocked goods on behalf of the Shanghai export merchants. Subsequently, because the Hanoi Japanese military delegation pointed out that some of the goods violated wartime prohibitions and should be confiscated, the negotiations yielded no results. This time, when French Ambassador Gossamer passed through Vietnam on his way from Chongqing to Shanghai, he spoke to the Vietnamese authorities on behalf of the detained goods and reportedly obtained satisfactory results. However, according to sources in the local shipping industry, before the Vietnamese authorities agreed to return the goods, some of the goods shipped from Shanghai to Free China had already been confiscated by the Vietnamese Customs authorities.

However, returning overseas Chinese may substitute the passport issued by the consular office, the certificate of an established overseas Chinese organization or school, or other reliable documents. The aforementioned certificate is in triplicate, one copy to be retained by the entrusted agency, one copy to be a duplicate to be submitted by the passenger after boarding the ship along with the ticket to the shipowner or compradore, and submitted to the reception agency designated by the Provincial Government upon arrival at the port of the province, and one copy to be a valid copy to be submitted by the military police inspection agency for verification when the passenger goes ashore. If the shipowner or compradore of the seagoing vessel fails to comply with the aforementioned regulations, the military police agency may suspend their right of entry and, if necessary, detain the vessel."

Travelers to Fujian can contact the General Affairs Department of the association at No. 687 Fuzhou Road, Sanshan Guild Hall.

### December Crime Report for the French Concession

In December 1940, due to the cold weather increasing hardship and providing convenience for criminals, the number of criminal cases in the French Concession increased slightly. Among the newly added cases, robbery cases were the most numerous, while theft cases were greatly reduced. At the same time, the work of the police department was also intensified, as can be seen from the increase in the number of arrests.

There were four cases of murder and two cases of attempted murder this month, only one of which was political in nature, namely the assassination of Mr. Du Ge, the legal advisor and lawyer of the French Concession, on the 16th of this month when he returned home. The motives for the other three murder cases were all related to money. The first case was that of an elderly widow who was murdered by her maid in collusion with the murderer, who then swept away all the valuables in her home. After several weeks of investigation, the maid and the murderer were arrested. The second case was that of a money shop owner who was fatally wounded in a hotel by a friend who sought to take his money. The third case was that of a robber who shot and killed the shop owner in desperation during a failed robbery.

There was also a Chinese doctor who was shot and killed by a person who sought medical attention. The murderer was immediately arrested. After investigation, it was found that it was a case of revenge killing. In addition, there was one case of attempted murder, in which an armed robber suddenly shot at Western detective Robbie when he encountered a police search team. Fortunately, he dodged successfully and arrested the robber.

There were five kidnapping cases and one attempted kidnapping case in December. The first case occurred on Qiqi Road, where a sixteen-year-old student was kidnapped by five robbers in a taxi while traveling to school in a pedicab. The second case occurred a few days later, where an eight-year-old elementary school student was kidnapped by robbers in a taxi on Jufu Road while traveling to school with her sister in a rickshaw. The third case was that of another five-year-old child who was kidnapped by robbers at the end of Avenue Joffre. After the family paid a ransom of 800 yuan, they reported it to the police. As a result of the investigation, three kidnappers were arrested and the ransom was recovered. There were also two other cases, one involving a Chinese man working in a Western apartment and one involving a clerk in a rice store, but they were released after the police found clues. There were forty-four armed robbery cases, one attempted case, and fourteen robbery cases in December. The police arrested a total of twenty-one people and confiscated five real pistols and three fake pistols. Ten of the cases were successfully solved.

There were twenty-two cases of destruction and theft (compared to thirty-eight in November) and ten cases of burglary (compared to nineteen in the previous month). In these thirty-two theft cases, four thieves were arrested and seven cases were solved.

### Public Works Bureau Committee Suggests Increasing License Fees; License Fees Account for One-Eighth of Regular Income; New Fees Include Last Year's Surcharge

This committee was established with the mission to explore ways to increase revenue from the Public Works Bureau's collection of general donations, land taxes, and various license fees. The scope of work is quite broad, so the discussions have taken a considerable amount of time. We are now prioritizing the proposals regarding various license fees and have prepared a report for the bureau to consider and adopt. Further reports on other aspects will be submitted successively.

In recent years, license fees have accounted for one-eighth of the Public Works Bureau's total regular income. Last year, this income totaled approximately 4.6 million yuan. The Public Works Bureau's collection of license fees is based on the provisions of Articles 34 and 35 of the regulations. The various items listed in the current license fee schedule are all basic fees and do not include surcharges. The fee schedule proposed by this committee includes the 50% surcharge that has been implemented since the second half of last year. This new fee schedule has been compiled with reference to the situation during the committee's investigation and reporting period, and the bureau is requested to implement it within this year.

Theaters

Theaters, stages, and concert halls: This committee believes that such entertainment venues are consumer businesses; therefore, license fees should be higher than for other businesses. It is recommended that from this year onwards, the license fees for all the aforementioned entertainment venues should be equal to or close to one-tenth of their total business income. The calculation method can be based on the number of seats or by extracting one-tenth from the actual number of tickets sold. The licensee may choose either method.

Dance Halls

According to current estimates, there is no distinction in the standard of license fees between dance halls that do not provide dance partners and those that do. Currently, there are fifteen of the former and twenty-five of the latter. According to the police report, the business of each dance hall is quite developed. At present, the license fee, including the surcharge, is at least sixty yuan per month. This committee believes that there should be a distinction in the license fees levied between the above two types of dance halls. From now on, the license fee for dance halls that provide dance partners will be increased threefold, and the license fee for dance halls that do not provide dance partners will be increased by onefold, but the monthly license fee shall not be less than 120 yuan. As dance halls are also a type of consumer business, increasing their license fees is not inappropriate.

Brothels

And sing-song girls: The current license fee for brothels and sing-song girls is 15 yuan per quarter, plus a 50% surcharge. According to police reports, the business of each brothel is quite good. This committee believes that increasing this type of license fee should not place an excessive burden on the sing-song girls. From now on, the license fee for brothels should be increased to 48 yuan per quarter, and the license fee for sing-song girls should be increased to 24 yuan.

Billiard

Rooms and bowling alleys: The current license fee for each billiard table or bowling lane is 7.50 yuan per quarter, which should be increased to 15 yuan.

Other

Entertainment venues: Such entertainment venues, such as ice skating rinks, Qingchang and storytelling venues, swimming pools, and temporary bazaars, are also consumer businesses, and their license fees should be doubled according to the current amount.

Restaurants

And eateries: So-called restaurants and eateries include restaurants that do not sell alcoholic beverages, Chinese or Japanese style restaurants, Chinese and Western food stores, and tea rooms, etc. Most of them are food stores and restaurants set up by Chinese, totaling 4,400, serving people of all levels of society. Moreover, the collection of such license fees implies an emphasis on public health, so the license fees for these shops are not intended to be changed.

Food

Stores, fruit stores, or fruit stalls: The items sold in these types of shops are also mainly essential items, and the focus of collecting license fees is the same as the previous item, so the license fees are also not intended to be changed.

Clubs

Chinese-established clubs: The current license fee is 35 yuan per quarter, plus a 50% surcharge. From now on, it is proposed to divide them into two categories, A and B. Those with complete club facilities will be classified as A, and those without complete facilities will be classified as B. The fees are as follows: Category A, with 200 members or less, is 50 yuan per quarter; exceeding the above number, 5 jiao will be charged per person. Category B, with 100 members or less, is 50 yuan per quarter; exceeding the above number, 1 jiao will be charged per person.

Taverns

And beverage rooms: For all taverns, restaurants that also sell alcoholic beverages, liquor stalls, beer shops, and Chinese-style hotels, it is proposed to double the current license fees. In addition, the special permits to extend closing hours will also be doubled.

Apartments

And special rental hostels: These types of apartments house permanent residents more than temporary residents, so the license fees are not intended to be changed.

Hotels

(Excluding special rental hostels): Hotels cater to both permanent and temporary travelers. Due to the crowded population of this port, business is quite developed. The current license fees are indeed too low. Moreover, most hotels provide alcoholic beverages and should be classified as luxury businesses. After careful consideration by this committee, it was concluded that the current license fees should be revised. Detailed methods are listed in the attached schedule. License fees for coffee shops and tea rooms remain unchanged.

Dairy Farms

Category A and B dairy farms: It is proposed to change the fee to 15 yuan per cow per year. Category A (T.T.) dairy farms: 10 yuan per cow per year. (Unfinished) At number 476, seven robbers suddenly broke in. Four robbers drew their guns, threatening silence and not to make a sound. They robbed 500 yuan in cash and clothes, etc., with a total value of more than 1,000 yuan.

### Expectations for Industrial and Commercial Circles

— Guihu

A Humble Appeal on Behalf of Industrial and Commercial Employees

Indeed, the ever-increasing price tide that floods today's isolated city is already a serious matter, isn't it?

In recent days, after reading several articles in this publication about the plight of primary school teachers, I feel compelled to speak out on behalf of the tens of millions of industrial and commercial employees in another corner of this isolated city!

In the past two or three years, haven't the various industrial and commercial sectors of the isolated city taken the opportunity to make huge profits? But I must tell everyone, the profits of industrialists and businessmen are one thing, while the livelihood of industrial and commercial employees is another.

Since the outbreak of the war, this group, lying low in the professional circles and busying themselves with their work, their salaries and remuneration have only decreased compared to pre-war levels. This is not just referring to the early stages of the war. It is said that many business authorities, in order to reduce losses and maintain operations, have taken actions such as salary cuts to retain employees. Since then, and up to now, as the cost of living has risen day by day, the real value of the original salary has only decreased. The use of ten dollars before the war can only be worth a little more than one dollar today. Naturally, the consumption of industrial and commercial employees is still the same as before the war. This has created the highest tide of hardship for the employees!

This is a very common and real phenomenon. In many stores and companies today, the highest salaries of employees are only around seventy dollars, while the middle-level salaries are mostly around thirty dollars. Apprentices, well, good ones get around ten dollars, and some are still stuck at one dollar a month! (Even more tragic, according to an apprentice in a tailor shop: their monthly wage is still only forty cents!) But ask, with the cost of living at more than ninety dollars a dan of rice today, if a family of three (husband and wife included), even the highest salary of seventy dollars is difficult to cope with. What about those who earn around thirty or ten dollars? A young apprentice with four cents a month probably has to grow long hair for several months before he can afford a shave!

When I read in the newspapers about workers in certain stores going on strike, I feel deeply about the scenes of their miserable lives. I deeply feel that what is spreading over the heads of all industrial and commercial colleagues today is heavy dark clouds and layers of misery. Life is difficult!

I remember that a certain newspaper commented on the wave of strikes in recent days, hoping that the authorities in general industry and commerce would not ignore the living conditions of their subordinates and colleagues, and should remedy them in a timely manner to ensure their peace of mind. Otherwise, when a labor strike breaks out, and negotiations are fortunately resolved satisfactorily, the losses to the business are almost like a "candle" temper. At the same time, he hoped that the workers would not be tools of those who hate us, and should seek fairness and purity. This is indeed a fair point.

But unfortunately, as we have seen, there are too few general industrialists and businessmen who can first seek the benefit of their employees and colleagues. In yesterday's newspaper, although there was news of a certain bank and a certain large silk shop in this city automatically raising wages, regardless of whether it is appropriate to the current cost of living, their concern for employees and their warm hearts for the benefit of their colleagues are admirable!

We respectfully expect the industrial and commercial authorities to show the greatest compassion and save the lives of our colleagues from fire and water. In fact, this is not only the most realistic charitable undertaking, but also a way to stabilize the situation in this isolated city today. Even for the sake of industry and commerce itself, encouraging employees to serve with peace of mind and improving service efficiency is also a way to protect oneself. Those in authority who are immersed in abnormal profits should realize this?

### Begonia

— Qin Shou'ou

Before he could finish speaking, two guards had rushed towards Yuhua; but before they could get close, the first one tripped over something at his feet, turned a somersault, and the second was violently bumped into the waist by someone, immediately face up, back to the ground and fell backwards. Just as the whole house was in chaos, Yuhua's body was carried away.

"Second brother, what is this...! A man is responsible for his own actions! Why should I..." Yuhua struggled all the way, still shouting; but Yu Kun was small but strong, carrying him and never letting go, his body only jumped a few times, and then slipped out.

The beastly nature of Division Commander Yuan is now really about to break out, almost wanting to pull out the pistol in his waist, no matter who it is, first kill a few, then say.——This was originally his best method of venting his anger.

"Fifth Uncle, don't embarrass Shopkeeper Zhang! Let's talk about it later." A man in plain clothes in his twenties, standing close to him, tried his best to hold his hand and persuade him.

"Good boy, see where you can escape to?" The two guards scrambled up in embarrassment, heard their master yelling, and planned to chase after them again.

"Brothers, don't chase!" The man in plain clothes called out before it was too late. "I guess he can't escape, we have something to say to Shopkeeper Zhang!"

Shopkeeper Zhang really didn't even dream that such a thing would happen, so panicked that he couldn't say anything, only bowing to Division Commander Yuan, who was at least twice as tall as him, repeatedly, almost kowtowing.

"Division Commander, don't be angry, I will definitely fire him later!" It was still Master Song who was experienced, busy calming his mind and said: "What Seventh Master said just now is not bad, let's talk about it again...."

"Ah! What's the matter...?" Master Song's words were not finished, and many students behind him exclaimed again, and when he turned back to look, Yuqin had already fainted on the ground; a teacher in the troupe was busy loosening the collar around his neck, while repeatedly shouting "Get cold water! Get cold water!"

This finally dispelled some of Division Commander Yuan's anger, hanging a head weighing dozens of pounds, and opening a pair of eyes full of eroticism, wantonly watching Yuqin who had lost consciousness, wishing he could pick him up immediately. At the same time, he was secretly thinking in his heart:

"The world will actually have such a handsome child, even more delicate than the two women at home!" (11)

### Words on Cultivation (40)

There is right reason and wrong reason. Right reason is true reason. There is only one right reason, and it will never result in harming others to benefit oneself. Wrong reason is sophistry. It is not really reason. There are eighteen wrong reasons. Everyone seizes one wrong reason. Everyone wants to harm others to benefit oneself, either leading to a stalemate or hurting both sides.

### Scare

— Juehui

Not long ago, a Christmas dinner cost thirty-five dollars, which was scary enough; but now, before one scare has subsided, another arises: a "Lunar New Year" (although abolished, it is still thriving) New Year's Eve dinner costs fifty dollars a table!

However, although there are many scares, there are also many who are happy: make a phone call and book a few tables. It saves time, effort, and "money"... three birds with one stone, why not do it? So, why not go ahead...

Fifty dollars a table is a "fake scare"; the fact that so many people are ordering is a "real scare".

Everything can be expected this "year"; of course, there are even more "scary" "amazing moves" behind!

Therefore, the poor should be careful not to be scared into "trouble", so as to "kill" the rich man's interest!

### Do Not Let Us Be Disappointed

— Luosu

"Chunqiu" gave us a piece of good news in the New Year, no, just a piece of good news for male impoverished students. The enthusiasm of that anonymous gentleman is indeed admirable, and we also hope that enthusiastic people in the society will see the good deeds of this gentleman and respond accordingly. But we do not hope that they will also be like this gentleman: "Male students with both excellent character and academic performance and poor family backgrounds are eligible to apply for scholarships." This sentence, from this gentleman's mouth, flowed out lightly, but cruelly barred many poor female students from the door. I myself am a female student, (fortunately, although my family is not extremely wealthy, I can still go to high school like my brothers.) I have seen many classmates who are very ambitious and interested in their studies, but they were all dropped out halfway. Although some families may still be able to barely afford the tuition fees for one or two children, this priority is given to their brothers. They wept, they sighed, but what's the use? They left school in tears! Therefore, gentlemen, do not think that female students are all useless, or you may have said: "Female students are very vain, unwilling to put their hearts into it, unwilling to endure hardship." You are right, to some extent, you are right. But I believe that not all female students are like this! So gentlemen, I beg you not to say again: "Male students with excellent character and academic performance are eligible to apply for assistance." Please say, like many schools, that both men and women are admitted, we will not let you down. Although society cannot provide women with proper employment at the moment, I believe, I hope that this system of valuing men over women will one day collapse. Gentlemen, believe in us! Please say: "Students, regardless of gender, are eligible to register." Do not let us be disappointed, we await your response.

### New Year's Gongs and Drums

— Cheng Weitao

It was past ten o'clock in the evening, and we were sitting in the living room chatting. Everything was very quiet, only the New Year's gongs and drums being beaten in the alley were still "dong dong clang", "dong dong clang" being beaten, gradually reaching the doorway of my house. After beating for a moment, they knocked on the door of my house. My father didn't plan to open the door, ignoring them, and my mother said, "The New Year is coming soon, being scolded by them a few times is unlucky." My father had to bite the bullet and open the door.

The door opened, and I saw several people in long gowns and tilted hats, low-class gangsters, each holding drums, gongs, cymbals, etc., and said, "Boss, make a fortune, make a fortune, help us."

My father said, "Nothing, even we ourselves don't have enough to eat."

"Boss, you're too polite, it's a difficult year, help us out."

My father had no choice but to take out forty cents for them. They took the money, looked at it, and said, "Boss, it's not enough, add some." "Polite eyes!" "Help us out!" "Give us a dollar!"

My father said, "Same old rules, we also gave forty cents last year, the same."

"Boss, yes! That's right, what time was last year, what time is this year, not to mention anything else, just rice has to sell for a hundred yuan a dan, these forty cents, we divide it among us, it's not enough to eat a meal, Boss, polite eyes, add some! Make a fortune, make a fortune!" After saying this and that, he added another twenty cents to settle the matter. My father closed the door and sighed heavily, saying, "Shanghai is really not a place to live, the cost of living is so high, and you have to spend money everywhere, how can we salary earners maintain the daily life of a family! Alas! Alas!" Then he sighed twice in a row.

We were preparing to sleep, and in the distance, we could still hear the sound of beating New Year's gongs and drums, "dong dong clang", "dong dong clang".

### Zhang Yipeng Performs at the Renovation

— Min

The Continuing Efforts of "Improved Peking Opera"

Since the Jin sisters' "Zhonghua Troupe" failed to perform "The Peach Blossom Fan" at the renovation, everyone not only lacks the courage for "improved Peking opera", but also feels unspeakable pain when mentioning these four words as if they have committed a crime. But there are still some Peking opera practitioners who are still working hard on "improvement". For example, last year, "Xinyi" opened its pier to Ningbo, but unfortunately, it also failed due to poor management and disagreement. However, Zhang Yipeng, known as the Monkey King, has been engaged in research on "improved Peking opera" during his more than one year of retirement, and it is said that he has gained a lot of experience. Now it is scheduled to be performed at the renovation from the first day of the lunar new year. All the scripts "The Eight Righteous Men of the Great Song Dynasty", "Robin Hood", "A New Look" and other scripts all start from "improvement", and Pei Chong (ie, Zigong in "Confucius"), an actor from the Republic of China, is invited to serve as a screenwriter consultant. Regarding music and lighting, it is said that Xuan Gang is responsible. What the future results will be, naturally cannot be predicted now, but I think that the future of "improved Peking opera" will one day be successful in "business" through unremitting efforts.

### Hollywood Trends

— Huilin

The famous producer Sam Goldwyn is preparing to make a film of the life of the world-renowned children's fairy tale writer Andersen. Andersen's works are still loved by children around the world today, translated into dozens of languages, and are popular. Because he is Danish, the Danish Consulate in Los Angeles has informed Goldwyn that he should take a serious attitude to film the biography of Andersen, because Andersen is not only a hero in the history of Danish literature, but also a giant of children's literature in the world literary world. The film has now been decided to be starred by Gary Cooper.

The famous child star Freddie Bartholomew recently joined the Boy Scouts. He was very excited when he first went camping in the wild. Setting up a tent and sleeping on a bedding covered with soil was really his first experience in his life. Freddie is one of the Hollywood child stars with the worst health, and is now gradually getting better. He has to exercise his physique, otherwise he will not be able to make movies in the future.

Victor McLaglen, a tough star who has something in common with Huarise Pirai, has not made a film for Universal Pictures for a long time since "New Gold Mountain". Recently, a naval battle film was given to him to star in. In addition to Victor, there are Edmund Lowe, William Cagney, and Riceford, all of whom are tough supporting roles.

According to the statistics of Warner Bros. before this autumn, the report on the number of fan letters received by the stars is as follows: Miss Ann Sheridan ranks first, second is Errol Flynn, third is Bette Davis, fourth is James Cagney, and fifth is actually Humphrey Bogart (this villain on the screen). Errol Flynn's films have a large audience in South America, while James Cagney's films are very popular in the eastern United States.

Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" is recognized as the only giant film after "Gone With the Wind", and only the box office record of "Gone With the Wind" can be compared with it. Chaplin has decided to go to South America with his wife Paulette Goddard for a long-term trip for a period of rest.

Hollywood will have an international film, which is "Arise My Love" co-starred by Claudette Colbert and Ray Milland, because the story of this film starts from the Spanish Civil War and continues to describe the armistice agreement signed by France and Germany in the forest of Compiègne this year. This film will probably be a sensation for movie fans.

Bette Davis, who married on New Year's Day this year, was recently praised as "the most democratic star in Hollywood" at a rally to fight for democracy. The picture shows Mrs. Luo, the president of the "Hollywood Chinese Actors Association" who attended this rally, presenting an ancient bowl to pay tribute on behalf of the association.

### Willow in a Pavilion

— 頋 Mingdao

Shi Da feinted with a spear, and then turned his horse and left. Ali Tai rode his horse to catch up, gradually approaching, the two horses were no more than seven or eight steps apart, Ali Tai was about to swing his knife to chop Shi Da's horse's butt, but unexpectedly Shi Da shouted violently, suddenly turned his bear waist, and suddenly a spear from bottom to top, like an eagle flying and a dragon leaping, directly picked to Ali Tai's throat. Ali Tai said badly, and tilted his head to the side, wanting to take his knife back to block, Shi Da followed by dropping the gun down, and sent it forward smoothly, piercing into Ali Tai's shoulder, blood splashed straight, Ali Tai fell off his horse immediately. The Qing army hurriedly rescued him, and scrambled into the city in a panic. Shi Da took advantage of the situation to cover up and kill, the Qing soldiers in the city came forward to meet him, and closed the city gate firmly, and lowered the arrows and stones. Shi Da led the crowd to attack for half a day, but could not rush into the city. Suddenly, he received a report from someone sent by Huang Yuqi, that Huang Yuqi and Xu Qu led the righteous soldiers to attack the north city of the county at the fifth watch last night, and set fire to the gate. When the city was about to be broken, Magistrate Xia Yie led more than a hundred elite soldiers, opened the door and killed out, and rushed across the drawbridge. There were two family generals around Xia Yie who had some brute force, each holding a very thick stick in their hands, and knocked down five or six righteous soldiers in a row. Xia Yie also ordered his subordinates to beat the drums tightly, and the righteous soldiers did not know the truth, after all, they were all hastily assembled and untrained, so they fled in all directions. Huang Yuqi cut down two people with his sword, but could not stop them, and followed the defeat. Xu Qu had already been captured by the Qing soldiers. Huang Yuqi was trapped by the Qing army on a small mountain, and could not break through, regretting that he had mistakenly listened to Xu Qu's words, and sent Shi Da away, which was a miscalculation, so he sent two strong soldiers to Danyang to ask for help quickly. Shi Da was shocked when he heard the news, and hurriedly abandoned Danyang and returned to rescue. The city saw that the righteous soldiers retreated suddenly, and did not understand the reason, and also saw vaguely banners in the forest attached to the city, suspected that the righteous soldiers were luring the enemy, and the commander had been seriously injured, so they did not dare to chase. Shi Da rushed back to Changzhou and attacked the place surrounded by the Qing army. Huang Yuqi saw the flags of the righteous army from afar on the mountain, and the Qing soldiers separated on both sides, with a mass of black clouds in the middle, galloping left and right, with a silver light, flying up and down. When he saw it, he was overjoyed in his heart, knowing that Shi Da's reinforcements had arrived. He ordered his subordinates to charge down the mountain, echoing on both sides, and then drove the Qing soldiers back and rescued Huang Yuqi. (37)

### Interesting Facts about the Charity Performance for the Taiwan Disaster

— Sun Choucheng

The Taizhou flood was extremely severe. Yu Qiaqing, Wang Ruxin and others urged famous ticket holders to sing charity performances at the Renovation Stage on the evenings of the 14th and 15th of this month to raise funds. I went both nights, and selected one or two interesting things I saw and heard to record below. On the first night, Ms. Liao Jia'ai performed Su San's Release, and the flower baskets and silver shields given by all walks of life were piled up like mountains. Ms. Liao works in an insurance company and is also Mr. Yu Qiaqing's secretary. She is not only beautiful, but also has a sweet voice, and her singing and acting are excellent. The entire Wang Baochuan by Zhu Xiaoqiu and Zhao Peixin, who was the main performer, was very energetic. On the second night, Cheng Zhongfan and Cheng Ejun sang He Hou's Scolding the Palace. Zhongfan was of the Yingxiu clan, Ejun was of the Yushuang clan, and their singing voices were melodious. Yu Qiaqing presented them with a plaque of "Famous Scholar's Romance", because Zhongfan is the son of Cheng Dequan, the first governor of Jiangsu, and the two were originally husband and wife, but now they have become uncle and sister-in-law on stage. Then Ms. Zhang Yizu sang Yutangchun, her expression was delicate, and her pronunciation was accurate. Mr. Yu Qiaqing presented her with a horizontal plaque with the two characters "Jing Guan", matched with the couplet "Not only for the joy of vision and hearing, but also for singing to save the hungry and drowning". Zhu Xiaoqiu, the main performer, played Zhao Jintang and sang the Zhu Hen Ji, from the beginning of his official sealing and sacrificing to the grave to the reunion of flesh and blood, meticulously, matched with Wang Hongfu's Zhu Chundeng, complementing each other.

### Zhang Shankun Talks About: The Motivation for Founding Zhang Garden

— Yixing

Now, the people living in Shanghai really feel quite depressed. Their pastimes in their spare time are almost all confined to their houses, such as movies, Peking opera, dancing, and Shanghai opera, Shaoxing opera, and so on. No matter what season it is, everyone yearns for the scenery of nature. In the past, even if they didn't run very far, taking a day or two to play in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Wuxi was the most interesting thing.

According to Mr. Zhang Shankun, the founder of the "Zhang Garden", which is about to open, the motivation for its founding is to satisfy the hope of the Chinese and Western residents of Shanghai. He said: "For example, at this time, everyone is thinking of going to Dengwei Mountain to see the plum blossoms. Now, even if you don't leave Shanghai, you can still see the plum forest of Dengwei, because Zhang Garden has moved nearly a thousand tall plum trees here. The purpose of "Zhang Garden" is to find fresh and proper ways out for Shanghai citizens in entertainment. If everyone does not deny that people should have a little entertainment, then "Zhang Garden" should be everyone's ideal paradise."

The author also visited the interior of the garden, which is being built in a big way. It is roughly divided into four parts: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. It is said that the scenery of the four seasons will be presented in a miraculous way. In these seasonal sceneries, there are many new amusement facilities, such as carriages, trains, electric wave boats, fishing, horse racing, and so on. Mr. Zhang also said: "Our purpose is not only to serve the citizens in entertainment, but also to seek economy in terms of financial resources and time. For example, in the past, you went to Dengwei to see plums, Longhua to see peaches, and Niushou Mountain in Nanjing to see red leaves. Now, no matter what you enjoy with your ears and eyes, or what you enjoy physically, you can get it in a very economical time and financial resources."

Entertainment is essential for people. Although now is not the time for revelry, it is appropriate to have some proper entertainment, so we would like to introduce the establishment of "Zhang Garden" to everyone.

### Fen Guan's Outlook on Life (10)

Based on the theory of struggle, I designed a plan for struggle, and based on the plan for struggle, I gradually put it into practice, and used practice to complete my theory. The university said that things must be investigated before knowledge can be extended. Investigating things is practice. Without practice, only talking about theory, this kind of theory is empty and not very accurate.
