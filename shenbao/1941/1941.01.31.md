### U.S. Reporter's Interview with Chairman Chiang: Establishing Lasting Peace in the Far East Requires Cooperation Between China, the Soviet Union, and the United States. China Needs Greater Financial Aid from the U.S. Dr. Currie, Assistant to President Roosevelt, Departs for China

Chongqing. Yesterday, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in a solo interview with this reporter, stated that if the United States were to aid China with half the assistance it provides to Britain, the U.S. itself would not face the danger of being drawn into the Far Eastern war. Chairman Chiang firmly declared, "If China receives sufficient material aid, it can deal with Japan alone, without the need for external military assistance." Chairman Chiang further stated that in the war against Japan, China needs greater financial aid from the United States and the supply of military equipment. Chairman Chiang said he is preparing to receive Dr. Currie, an assistant to President Roosevelt, who has been sent by the U.S. President to study certain economic issues. Answering a reporter's question, Chairman Chiang said that the Yunnan-Burma Road is not in danger of being blockaded by Japan. This road is the only remaining route for transporting goods from the United States into China. This reporter traveled to Kunming and Lashio last week, the former being the first station on the Yunnan-Burma Road in Yunnan, and the latter being the end point of the road in Burma. According to most travelers, drivers, boatmen, and merchants, although Japanese bombing has caused slight damage to bridges and slightly hindered freight transport, the damaged areas are quickly repaired, and the disruption to shipping is temporary. Chairman Chiang expressed interest in the latest news from Washington and expressed great satisfaction with the cancellation of the moral embargo against the Soviet Union. He said, "Lasting peace in the Far East must be built on the cooperation of the great powers bordering the Pacific: China, the Soviet Union, and the United States."

San Francisco. Dr. Currie, an assistant to President Roosevelt, left here yesterday aboard a Clipper flying boat for Hong Kong. He is traveling to Chongqing on President Roosevelt's orders, which has aroused much speculation. However, the purpose of this trip has not been officially announced. But because Currie is a renowned economist and because the U.S. government has provided financial aid to China, observers believe that Dr. Currie's trip is to gather fresh economic data. He was born in Novia, and came to the US in 1925 and became a US citizen in 1934, in 1921.

Washington. General Chiang Kai-shek's solo meeting with Morris, the Far East Manager of the United Press, in Chongqing yesterday, emphasizing the importance of U.S. economic aid to China, has been received with sympathy by all sectors here today. They believe that the aforementioned statement proves the cooperative and friendly attitude of the highest Chinese authorities during Dr. Currie's trip to China, who is traveling to Chongqing on the President's orders to study economic issues. General Chiang told Mr. Morris yesterday that if the United States were to aid China with half the assistance it provides to Britain, China could fight Japan alone, and the U.S. would not face the danger of being drawn into the Far Eastern war. U.S. government officials pointed out that the purpose of U.S. economic aid to China, Britain, and Greece is very clear, and the government is continuing to sincerely study the method and extent of this aid. Officials further stated that General Chiang's decision to issue a statement is very timely, as it can draw public attention to China's urgent needs at a time when the public is gradually focusing on Britain. General Chiang's statement that lasting peace in the East must be built on the cooperation of China, the United States, and the Soviet Union is clearly in line with the U.S. view of the Far East. Non-official sources here now say that Britain, fearing that the Soviet Union might aid Germany, requested strict control over exports to the Soviet Union, but the sudden cancellation of the moral embargo against the Soviet Union is truly perplexing. The amount of loans extended by the U.S. government to China at the beginning of this year totaled U.S.$240 million (six portions were handled by the Export-Import Bank). This figure does not include the U.S.$50 million for the Currency Stabilization Fund loan. The procedures and actual use of the Currency Stabilization Fund loan are still being finalized. The impression here is that when discussing the Lend-Lease Act, the United States will adhere to its traditional Far Eastern policy, upholding the Open Door policy, sovereignty, and the sanctity of treaties. Therefore, foreign affairs experts believe that the future of Sino-U.S. cooperation is very promising. (United Press Correspondent Franz, 30th)

### Sichuan-Shaanxi Road, Chongqing-Guangyuan Section, to Open Tomorrow

Chongqing. Highway transportation between Chongqing and the Northwest is a vital route for connecting international lines and plays a crucial role during the war. In November of last year, Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Communications inspected transportation in the Northwest and, recognizing the urgent need to strengthen the existing transportation capacity of the line, immediately established the Sichuan-Shaanxi Joint Transportation Office to organize direct traffic between Chongqing and Guangyuan. The office has now been established, with five stations set up along the line in Chongqing, Neijiang, Chengdu, Zitong, and Guangyuan.

Editorial

### The Dissolution of the New Fourth Army

The Chinese Military Commission's decision to dissolve the New Fourth Army, compared to the issue of resistance and nation-building, which is tied to the survival and revival of the Chinese nation, or to the European war, which is tied to the long-term destiny of many nations, or to the issue of U.S. aid to China, Britain, and Greece, which is tied to the future safety of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, can truly be seen as a minor incident that is not worth mentioning and does not constitute a problem. However, various parties, both domestic and foreign, may not be able to objectively weigh the importance and distinguish between the major and minor aspects of this incident. It has become a popular topic in society, and people in other countries have also expressed their concern. It goes without saying that those who rejoice in others' misfortunes are exaggerating the situation. On the other hand, the Military Commission has repeatedly disclosed the circumstances surrounding this decision, which is very different from the previous casual treatment of the punishment of figures like Han Fuju and Shi Yousan. This is probably because it has seen the excessive attention paid to this incident by various parties. Because of the excessive attention paid by various parties, this reporter would also like to briefly express his views.

A month ago, this reporter published a commentary entitled "Rumors About the Chinese Communist Party," with the aim of urging the New Fourth Army to comply with the order to transfer its defense area. At that time, the Military Commission had already issued the order to transfer the defense area, but the New Fourth Army was engaging in evasive tactics and refusing to obey the order. Moreover, various signs indicated that dissolution was inevitable. The initial attempts by the central government to compromise and appease, and the final point at which it could no longer tolerate the situation, as well as the complex twists and turns involved, are detailed in the speech by the spokesman of the Military Commission reported in the newspaper in mid-last month, as well as in the full text of the joint telegram from Generals He Yingqin and Bai Chongxi to Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, Ye Ting, and Xiang Ying before the decision was made to dissolve the New Fourth Army. There is no need for this reporter to elaborate further. Anyone who has read that speech and the joint telegram, after understanding the causes and consequences, will inevitably feel pain and sigh! It is because, within the camp of resistance and nation-building, there are still some officers and soldiers who are unable to recognize the threat and crisis posed to the nation by the invasion, and who do not devote their loyalty and energy to the combat mission they are responsible for. They are also unable to recognize that military orders and strategies are the longitude and latitude that must be respected in the entire war, and are also the foundation that must be maintained to win the final victory. Moreover, they still exhibit the various phenomena described in that speech and the joint telegram, which cannot but be considered beyond general imagination.

Regarding this matter, both Chinese people and friends of China deeply sigh and feel pain. Not only sighing and feeling pain, but also hearing talks of worry and suspicion. Some believe that this is the beginning of a split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. In fact, this is a matter of military discipline and not a political issue. It is the dissolution of the New Fourth Army and not the punishment of the Communist Party. The fault lies with some officers and soldiers of the New Fourth Army and not the complete rejection of all officers and soldiers of the New Fourth Army. These differences must be clearly distinguished. After a clear distinction is made, no matter how this matter develops, it will not lead to the inevitable conclusion of a split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Moreover, the beliefs and reputation that the Communist Party currently holds are mainly based on accepting the Three Principles of the People and supporting the national policy of resistance and nation-building. If some members of the Communist Party resent the Kuomintang because they are dissatisfied with the dissolution of the New Fourth Army, then this matter is definitely not the beginning of a so-called split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but rather the beginning of a continued split within the Communist Party regarding the acceptance of the Three Principles of the People and the support of the national policy of resistance and nation-building, because their main components and foundations are based on this. Some believe that this is a measure that weakens the strength of the resistance and nation-building. In fact, while the strength of resistance and nation-building is valued for its depth, it is not valued for its complexity and impurity. The combination and application of strength must be unified and disciplined. Overlapping and deviating from discipline will not only fail to become a component of strength but will inevitably affect the function of other forces due to mutual cancellation. Therefore, elimination is a normal evolution and also a manifestation of strength. Its meaning is very different from "mutual destruction" and even the opposite of "weakening." Some believe that it will result in a situation where birds flock to the forest and fish fight in the deep, creating enemies for oneself. In fact, people with national consciousness, after being influenced by nationalism, prioritize the nation above all else and will never waver. However, wavering elements are always unreliable and dangerous elements. We have no way of knowing what basic concepts the New Fourth Army usually used to train and restrain its troops, but the struggle that China is engaged in today is neither a political struggle nor a class struggle, but a national struggle. Therefore, how can the dissolution of the New Fourth Army shake the national beliefs of the people in the military? In short, these worries and suspicions stem from a deep love for China, but also from a lack of understanding of reality. Although we cannot recognize the New Fourth Army as a force when it exists, the evaluation of strength must be based on the premise of obedience to discipline and the actual contribution to resistance and nation-building. If the premise is not established, then the contribution equals zero, and the evaluation equals zero.

### British House of Commons Debate on Trade in China; Undersecretary Butler Says Impacted by Japanese Restrictions

London. Yesterday in the House of Commons, a member asked whether the situation in the British concession in Tianjin was satisfactory and whether British nationals could freely travel between the concession and the occupied areas. Undersecretary Butler replied, "Yes." Conservative member Milner asked whether British ships were permitted to sail up the Pearl River to Guangzhou. Butler replied that British ships sailed to Guangzhou once a week and that difficulties had arisen regarding quarantine regulations and pilotage fees, but that discussions were underway. Conservative member Graham asked what restrictions the Japanese had imposed on imports and exports in the occupied areas of China, and to what extent these restrictions affected British trade. Butler then outlined the restrictions in North China, Central China, and South China, saying that British and other foreign merchants were greatly affected by these restrictions. Conservative member Mogen asked whether there were any improvements to report regarding the facilities available to British shipping in Chinese coastal ports such as Qingdao and Yantai. Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Eden was currently collecting reports on the latest situation, as it affected the facilities available to British shipping in North China. The Foreign Secretary has also requested that a report be prepared on the inland waterways of China, excluding the Yangtze River, for use by human shipping. (Reuters, 30th)

I have never slacked in my efforts to achieve a victorious outcome to the China Incident as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the stability of the Emperor's heart." The Minister of the Army then praised the loyalty and courage of the fallen soldiers, whereupon Minister of the Navy Oikawa rose and said that he fully agreed with the Minister of the Army's remarks.

Tokyo. According to Xiamen news received by the Japanese side, the Chairman of the Kulangsu Municipal Council, Mr. Bushcock, and one other director, suddenly resigned on January 23, leaving only one Japanese director on the Council. As a result, municipal affairs have again come to a standstill. The Council was originally scheduled to meet on January 24 to discuss the four points of negotiation proposed by the Japanese Consul General on January 21 regarding the shooting of Mr. Huang Longgang (transliteration), the Taiwanese chief of the Xiamen District Court, on January 17. However, due to the insufficient number of directors, the Council could not legally convene. As a result, the affairs of the Council were taken over by the consular body headed by the British Consul General, as had happened in 1926 when the Council was unable to form a board of directors.

The British government has decided to make use of this investment, so it has invited Sir Peacock, who has considerable experience in this matter, to go to the United States to conduct on-site research into the possibility of utilizing this investment.

### Matsuoka Answers Assembly Questions, Expresses Determination to Advance Southward, Japanese-Soviet Relations Difficult to Improve in Short Term, American Officer Believes Japan Will Invade the Philippines

Tokyo. Yesterday, Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, in answering questions from the House Budget Committee, stated that the Dutch East Indies is eager to establish an economic agreement with Japan in order to "avoid unfortunate incidents." Assemblyman Imai believes that the United States may use force to interfere with Japan's southward advance. He asked Mr. Yosuke Matsuoka what degree of confidence he has regarding Japan's peaceful negotiations with the Dutch East Indies. The Foreign Minister, in answering the Assemblyman's questions, admitted that the problem will be addressed with utmost effort, because "the Dutch East Indies seems to hope to establish this agreement to avoid things from becoming extremely deteriorated." Regarding the question of whether the United States might intervene, the Foreign Minister stated that Japan should show the United States "a strong determination." Yosuke Matsuoka then answered Mr. Kawanishi's question, saying, "Up until now, my tone regarding future U.S.-Japan relations has been based on past facts. My tone may be too pessimistic, but in the dictionary of diplomats, there is no such word as 'despair.'" He also said that Japan has sent General Nomura as an envoy to the United States to solemnly inform President Roosevelt and the American people of "the disasters that humanity will suffer" if the United States joins the war. The Foreign Minister, in answering another question from Kawanishi regarding the Soviet Union, admitted that it is not easy to improve relations with the Soviet Union "overnight." He continued that he is willing to continue negotiations, "not hoping to achieve it at one stroke."

### Greek King Proclaims to the People Resolution to Continue Resistance and Strive for Victory, Metaxas' State Funeral Scheduled for Today, Significant Progress Made by Greek Troops in Central and Northern Albania

Athens. After the death of Prime Minister General Metaxas, King George of Greece issued a message to the Greek people, calling Metaxas one of the honorable figures in Greek history, and saying that Greece, with the protection of Heaven, will surely survive and be victorious, worthy of its ancestors and its martyrs.

(30th Haitong News Agency dispatch)

Athens. The state funeral of the late Greek Prime Minister General Metaxas will be held on Friday. His body is currently placed in a chapel here for public mourning. According to reports, he first felt unwell during a cabinet meeting on January 17th, and later underwent surgery to remove a decaying throat core. His condition improved considerably, but unexpectedly caused a recurrence of old internal organ pain, resulting in internal bleeding. Although he received blood transfusions, he gradually fell into a coma. All family members and government personnel were present at the time of his death. General Papagos, Commander-in-Chief of the Greek forces on the Albanian front, announced the news of the Prime Minister's death in a military order, ordering his subordinates to pray for the peace of the soul of this historical figure and to resolutely engage in combat to achieve ultimate victory. (30th Reuters dispatch)

London. Athens Radio broadcast a statement from the Greek Ministry of Information last night, stating that Greek troops have cut off the retreat routes of two Italian regiments. In the past twenty-four hours, Italian troops continued to launch desperate counterattacks, resulting in defeat and retreat. The new Italian Commander-in-Chief, General Gavarillo, is making his greatest efforts in the central sector of the front, so the fighting in the central sector is particularly fierce. Two Italian regiments have lost contact with their base and have been scattered by Greek artillery fire. Another two Italian units are also isolated and hiding in the woods. Greek troops made significant progress in defeating Italian operations in the central and northern sectors yesterday. The Italian troops are retreating in disarray. Since General Gavarillo launched his offensive, each Italian counterattack has incurred heavy costs in terms of manpower and material resources. (30th Reuters dispatch)

London. According to the latest news received in London, the Albanian front is now limited to a fierce battle in one corner, and Greek troops are clearly able to continue to make gains. Greek troops in the south have captured several high grounds and villages and are reportedly advancing towards Vlora. Although the newly appointed Italian commander is making every effort to supervise the battle and using more tanks and airplanes in counterattacks than before, according to Greek sources, the Italian counterattacks are only causing more bloodshed for the Italian troops. The Greek side claims to have captured many more enemies and shot down two Italian aircraft. The military hospital in Salonica was bombed by Italian aircraft, causing some casualties. Villages in Macedonia were also attacked. (30th Reuters dispatch)

Athens. The Italian troops have halted their counterattacks due to failure and are awaiting the arrival of reinforcements and war supplies to replenish their heavy losses.

The British army is using Tobruk as a forward base, which greatly facilitates the British advance, as the Italian troops abandoned a large amount of water and gasoline in Tobruk without destroying it. British responsible sources are very concerned about the fate of the 200,000 Italians residing in Abyssinia, as they are threatened by the growing Abyssinian patriotic movement. It is reported that many Italians are now concentrated in the Abyssinian capital and other places, as safety is only achieved when there are many people. However, the food problem will inevitably arise sooner or later. Even if some food is transported from Djibouti, it will be of no avail. (30th Reuters dispatch)

London. The Nile Army, fighting in the Libyan desert, is still advancing in an attempt to occupy Benghazi. According to recent news from Africa, British troops are now attacking the Italian army on all fronts. British troops encountered Italian resistance in Michili, south of Derna, where a large number of Italian troops were concentrated, carrying tanks. British forces in East Africa are also advancing according to plan, and some of the British troops attacking Sidi Barrani are now fighting the Italian army in Irildelia. According to a London authority, although the British have won victories in Africa, Britain is still the main aspect of the war. Although attacking Britain is currently secondary from the German point of view, this move is still the greatest danger to Allied forces. (30th Reuters dispatch)

London. An Italian communique stated that the Italian forces on the northern front in North Africa have repelled the Australian offensive and recaptured the strongholds occupied by the Australian forces. The communique also stated that there was artillery activity on the Libyan front and in Cyrenaica. On the Greek front, the war was hampered by adverse weather, but the Italian forces had some captures. (30th Reuters dispatch)

London. A Reuters correspondent in Libya reported that the sound of artillery fire is incessant around Derna. The British forces surrounding the area are now widely dispatching reconnaissance forces to scout the Italian deployment. (30th Reuters dispatch)

London. General de Gaulle's headquarters in London issued a communique yesterday, stating that a unit of Free French forces recently attacked Italian Libya, stating that in January, Free French forces stationed in Chad, under the command of General Leclerc, launched a long-distance attack on Italian Libya, penetrating deep into the Fezzan region and reaching a base in Maochake, destroying it, and attacking a guard post in Gatron, causing heavy damage to the enemy's manpower and material resources, and destroying several Italian aircraft on the ground. General de Gaulle has posthumously awarded Lieutenant Colonel Torano, the French captain who died in action in Maochake, with the Croix de Guerre. (30th Reuters dispatch)

Nanyang. After the Japanese troops invading north along the Pinghan Railway were blocked by Chinese forces in the Queshan area, they were unable to extend their reach. On the evening of the 25th, they once again forcefully invaded north from Yanghe. After Chinese forces intercepted them step by step in Shunshandian, Chugou and other places, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. After reinforcements, Chinese and Japanese forces are now engaged in fierce fighting in the Queshan area. (30th dispatch)

Nanyang. The Japanese troops invading southern Henan have suffered heavy casualties after being attacked and flanked by Chinese forces. The Japanese have suffered major blows on both wings of the Pinghan Railway and are unable to develop to the left or right. The Japanese troops who ventured deep are striving to extend north along the Pinghan Railway to maintain their precarious situation. The vanguard of 7,000 men is engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese forces near Queshan. (30th dispatch)

Chongqing. This afternoon, a military spokesman declared that there is currently fierce fighting in the fan-shaped area north of Xinyang in Henan Province. On January 24, two divisions of Japanese troops moved out from three bases north of Xin in five routes, advancing north. They encountered strong resistance two days later and are still continuing. When asked if the Japanese action was a harbinger of a spring offensive, the spokesman replied that this was probably not the case, because the strength of the Japanese troops was not sufficient to guarantee this belief. However, the spokesman acknowledged that the area was indeed the true intent of the Japanese, and the fighting further east was merely a diversion, hoping to hinder the movement of reinforcements. (30th Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing. At a press conference this afternoon, a military spokesman spoke of the southern Henan battle as one of the important battles, and the Japanese aim was clear that they attempted to open up the Pinghan Railway Line. How much the two divisions that are now used on the front can achieve depends on what happens in the next week. The Japanese launched an offensive at Jingdang and east of the Xiang River on the 12th to hold Chinese forces, but used not many troops and were driven back by the Chinese forces. The Japanese main force was at Xinyang, and on the 24th, they marched north in three routes from Changtaiguan, Chushandian, and Youhe. The Changtaiguan troops went east along the Pinghan Road, reaching Xin'andian on the 26th, while the other two routes went to Maojiguxian and other places southeast of Qinyang. They made advances of one hundred kilometers in two days. The Chinese forces have redeployed, and the fighting on the front line is extremely fierce. (30th Havas dispatch)

### On the Enlarged Memorial Week Meeting of the National Government, Chairman Chiang's Admonition: Explanation of the Dissolution of the New Fourth Army

Chongqing (Yesterday's Dispatch) I believe that not a single descendant of the Yellow Emperor would willingly act as an accomplice to the Japanese. Therefore, if today there are still those who endlessly spread rumors and exaggerate the already resolved issue of the New Fourth Army, they are merely acting as echoes for the rumor-mongers. My patriotic compatriots, both military and civilian, will certainly not be deceived by them and will undoubtedly reject them outright. Everyone must understand why we did not announce the illegal and undisciplined behavior of the New Fourth Army in the past. It is because the New Fourth Army was a part of the National Revolutionary Army, and I am the commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army. I often say that our revolutionary army is one big family. Therefore, I usually treat my subordinates as a parent treats his children. If the children are good, it is naturally the parent's honor; if the children are bad, it is also the parent's shame. Therefore, although the New Fourth Army has committed various crimes in the past, I always considered it my responsibility as commander-in-chief. To fulfill my responsibility and to protect my subordinates, I have only continuously warned and constantly supervised them, always hoping that they

would awaken and reform themselves, embark on the road to revolutionary success, and truly strive for the nation and the country. I was unwilling to expose their crimes, thereby cutting off their path to self-renewal and causing them to be spurned by the people of the whole country, both military and civilian. This is what I could not bear to do. However, my painstaking efforts did not move them. Instead, they thought that the central government was weak and incompetent, and even that I was afraid of them. They even threatened to influence international opinion and cause internal division and civil war, and did not hesitate to let the Japanese know our internal weaknesses, using this means to threaten us. I ask you, can the actions of a subordinate, being presumptuous, reckless, and utterly absurd, and whose malicious intentions even go so far as to use the exposure of the army's weaknesses to the enemy as a tool to intimidate superiors, such acts of regression and defiance, still be tolerated? In fact, the New Fourth Army's various illegal and undisciplined actions against the central government, both north and south of the Yangtze River, have long been known to the Japanese army, and they know them even more clearly than we do. Therefore, we are definitely not afraid of the Japanese or the international community knowing about their crimes that we did not announce them. There is also an important reason why I have always endured and kept silent, and that is that Chinese society, whether towards friends or subordinates, has always held a most important principle of morality, which is

to conceal evil and promote good. I have always treated people with this principle, especially my own subordinates. In terms of public duty, we are comrades-in-arms; in terms of private friendship, we are like family. The honor and disgrace of my subordinates are the honor and disgrace of my superiors; the merits and demerits of my subordinates are the merits and demerits of my superiors. Therefore, their faults can only be borne by myself. I will never announce them unless absolutely necessary. But they violated the law, disobeyed orders, and sabotaged operations to such an extent that I could no longer tolerate and condone them. If I did not take decisive measures, it would shake the national policy and endanger the country's survival. Everyone who has read the New Testament knows that the teachings of Christ exhort people to forgive sinners seventy times seven times. But the sins of the New Fourth Army have long exceeded seventy times seven times. Even if we have the utmost tolerance, we can no longer tolerate and forgive an army that is so incorrigible and obstinate. Otherwise, we would be committing a crime ourselves and harming the country, making me a sinner for all time. Everyone must also know that military discipline is a covenant that is recognized and observed by the entire army, from top to bottom, without distinction of rank, without special exceptions, and without deviation in treatment.

From the commander-in-chief to the soldiers, all are equal before military discipline. If someone violates military orders and undermines military discipline, and the commander-in-chief is negligent, or even condones evil, and fails to punish according to the law, then the commander-in-chief cannot escape his responsibility, and the entire army will be unable to fight. Therefore, in order to achieve victory and to safeguard the survival of the country, we must respect military orders and rectify military discipline, so that the entire army, from top to bottom, will clearly understand the strictness of military discipline. Under the strict military discipline, everyone should work together in the sacred war to accomplish our mission of saving the country and reviving the nation. Everyone knows why Japan is mired in the mud today and cannot extricate itself. It is because their government does not have the ability to maintain national law and enforce discipline, which has led to the entire nation being in its current situation. The September 18th Incident occurred because a group of young and radical officers acted freely and did not obey government orders, and their government did not have the ability to stop them. Therefore, there continued to be the so-called "May 15th Incident," which evolved into the crime of active-duty soldiers brutally murdering their prime minister. There was also the so-called "February 26th Incident," in which they murdered veteran statesmen and important cabinet members in their capital, and even occupied the parliament and destroyed the government. In the end, it led to the July 7th Incident, which triggered a war in East Asia unprecedented in history, destroying civilization. This is all because the Japanese army corrupted military discipline and the Japanese government failed to rectify discipline. However, the reason why the Japanese army can still temporarily maintain the status quo and continue to fight in our country today is that their military still maintains

the habit of obeying orders. Even if Japanese officers and soldiers are tired of war and oppose it, and do not want to fight this aggressive and futile war, they still reluctantly obey the order to fight. We can say that Japan's discipline has been completely destroyed, but the frontline troops are still barely maintaining combat discipline. This shows that in a life-or-death battle, everything depends on effective command and the thorough implementation of orders. The Japanese army's aggressive war is unjustifiable, yet their officers and soldiers dare not disobey orders. How much more should our war of resistance, which is entirely for resisting Japanese aggression and safeguarding the survival of the nation, cause our people, both military and civilian, to automatically awaken, spare no effort, carry out orders thoroughly, and accomplish tasks to maintain the dignity of national discipline and military discipline. Only then can we guarantee the victory of our war of resistance and achieve the independence, freedom, and equality of our country and nation. As long as all our troops strictly observe discipline, obey orders, and follow the plans and assigned tasks stipulated by the General Headquarters, and earnestly carry them out, our government will definitely treat them equally, support and cherish them, so that they can contribute to the course of the war of resistance and achieve glorious success. Now that the designation of the New Fourth Army has been cancelled, this issue is naturally completely resolved, and there are no other issues. Our government has always been generous and caring, and has always taken care to protect all troops. As for myself, in the position of commander-in-chief of the country, it is as if I see my own children being subjected to such dishonorable punishment.

I only feel grief and shame. I hope that the entire army, from top to bottom, will regard this incident as the greatest humiliation in our national revolution and as the most heartbreaking page in our history of resisting Japanese aggression and national reconstruction. We must take the New Fourth Army as a warning, and from now on obey orders, observe discipline, not invade the defense areas of friendly forces, not hinder the tasks of friendly forces, not entice the soldiers of friendly forces, not rob the weapons and ammunition of friendly forces, not collect civilian guns, not confiscate civilian food, not disturb the local area, and not harm the people. Furthermore, all troops across the country should be able to protect the people, stabilize society, and especially cherish the people in the occupied areas, so that our people, both military and civilian, will be united in love and spirit. Then, the grief left to us by this New Fourth Army incident will inspire the confidence of the entire army in resisting Japanese aggression and national reconstruction, and we will be able to turn misfortune into blessing and create the achievements of all the officers and soldiers of our National Revolutionary Army. In short, the handling of this New Fourth Army incident is entirely proactive, not passive. The main significance is to strengthen the war of resistance.

To summarize the key points, they are: (1) To thwart the Japanese ambition to weaken our war of resistance by alleging that our military discipline is corrupt and that we are internally divided. (2) To declare the discipline of the army, so that the entire army can have something to observe and admire, and be inspired to love themselves and serve the country, thereby strengthening our spirit of unity and resistance. Regarding the first point, if the Japanese know that our country has troops that act freely, hinder the war of resistance, and harm friendly forces, and that they are not subject to restraint, then their contempt for our country and our military will be even greater, and their aggressive ambitions will certainly become even more intense. Now that we have resolutely enforced discipline, punished them, and resolved the issue according to law, the Japanese have no reason to rejoice in our misfortune. Regarding the second point, if all our troops know that the government's previous endurance and silence were for the sake of the war of resistance, and that today's enforcement of the law is also for the sake of the war of resistance, and everyone takes this incident as a warning, then there will be no more actions that violate orders and undermine discipline. From now on, the entire army will unanimously uphold military discipline, obey military orders, and devote themselves to the war of resistance with one mind. There will be no more delays in executing orders, no more attacks on friendly forces, no more encroachment on defense areas, no more disrupting local areas, and no more harming the people. That is to say, the national spirit will embark on a path of progress, unity will be strengthened, and the strength of the war of resistance will also be strengthened. It must be understood that the thorough implementation of orders and the enforcement of military discipline are the guarantees

The most important key to the victory of the war of resistance is also the concern for the survival of the country. Whether the government has the ability to resist Japan and whether it is revolutionary depends on whether it can enforce discipline. Whether the army has the sincerity to defend the country and resist Japan also depends on whether it can abide by discipline and accept discipline. Only an army that strictly observes discipline and obeys orders is the true force of resistance and will be loved by the government and the people. Conversely, if they do not listen to orders, disregard discipline, abandon combat missions, or even attack friendly forces and reduce the strength of resistance, if such troops are allowed to exist, the country will inevitably perish, and not only will the war of resistance not succeed. Finally, I want to remind everyone that the government's decision to punish the New Fourth Army is entirely for the purpose of rectifying military discipline and does not involve other issues. This decision to handle the New Fourth Army is purely to punish troops that disobey orders and endanger the war of resistance. It has nothing to do with other troops that obey orders and work hard to resist Japan, and it has no political nature whatsoever. During the war of resistance, the government absolutely respects the due freedom and independent personality of all individuals, groups, and parties that abide by the program of resistance and provides them with

legal protection. As long as it is not the use of armed forces to resist government laws and decrees, even if there are legal issues involved, the government will handle them according to normal legal procedures. I often tell my friends that although our war of resistance is nearing victory, we cannot yet say that we have escaped the period of danger. At this important juncture of life and death, success or failure, the entire country, from top to bottom, must be especially careful and cautious. We must not be negligent or careless in anything, otherwise, our great cause of resistance will be ruined. However, the government must not be negligent and opportunistic in everything because of caution, and even fail to pursue responsibility or enforce discipline. In this way, the country and the revolution will never succeed. The reason why the government painfully punished the New Fourth Army is precisely because of this, and its significance lies in this. I hope that the entire country, both military and civilian, will be of one mind, strictly observe discipline, obey orders, and work together to fulfill our responsibilities and accomplish our mission of national revolution, and achieve our goal of saving the country and reviving the nation. As long as we all focus our efforts and actively undertake the great task of resisting Japanese aggression and national reconstruction, I believe that the bright future of our resistance is just around the corner.

Bangkok According to the commander-in-chief of the Thai army, fighting has ceased, except for a few minor clashes. A statement from the General Headquarters recounted the border fighting of the past two months, stating that the Thai army had occupied two corners of the right bank of the Mekong River. If the French had agreed to cede these territories earlier, the fighting of the past two months could have been avoided. The outbreak of hostilities was actually caused by the French bombing of Nakhon Phanom on November 27th of last year. In addition to occupying the two territories, the Thai army also penetrated twenty-five miles into Cambodia from Surin to Siem Reap. Since the start of the fighting, the Thai army has only suffered one hundred deaths and three hundred injuries, which is insignificant compared to the total number of French casualties. However, the French side has not yet announced its casualties. (Reuters, 30th)

### Hitler and Pétain to Hold Another Meeting; Germany Said to Have Made New Demands on France Related to the Future of the French Fleet

London Yesterday, Ankara Radio reported that there are some rumors that Hitler will soon hold another meeting with Marshal Pétain. (Reuters, 30th)

London Darlan, the Vichy Navy Chief, went to Paris last Christmas, carrying a letter from Marshal Pétain to Hitler, which reportedly concerned the conditions for Franco-German cooperation. Now, Belyrand, the Vichy government's representative in Paris, has returned to Paris from Germany, carrying Hitler's reply. The contents are unknown. It is expected that Belyrand will go to Vichy in a few days. Previously, there were unconfirmed rumors that Hitler had made far-reaching demands related to the future of the French fleet. Recently, there have been rumors that Hitler has asked Pétain to allow Germany to use the Tunis base to threaten Britain's dominance in the Mediterranean. (Reuters, 29th)

### German Aircraft Again Attack England; British Aircraft Also Bomb Germany

London After ten nights of tranquility, London was attacked again before midnight last night. It was reported that high-explosive bombs fell in a few areas, and incendiary bombs fell in two other areas. When the first incendiary bomb fell, the air raid wardens sounded the whistle to call on the public to help. Hundreds of civilians emerged from their homes to work, extinguishing all the incendiary bombs within ten minutes. Yesterday, a large number of German planes approached London, but most were driven back or dispersed by anti-aircraft fire. Only a few slipped into central London. Although German aircraft were very active yesterday, their attacks were not as fierce as in previous air raids. Several attacks lasted a long time, taking up most of the night, but Londoners have become accustomed to this. It is generally believed that the losses and casualties last night were minor. It was also reported that some provinces were also attacked yesterday, but they were not severe. Two bombs fell on a town on the southeast coast, destroying several houses and causing some casualties. (United Press, 30th)

London Last night and this morning, due to improved weather conditions on the continent, the British Air Force and German aircraft resumed their large-scale operations.

### Hitler's Broadcast Speech on the Eighth Anniversary of the National Socialist Party's Rule

Berlin Today is the eighth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule. German Führer Hitler will deliver a radio address to the German people at 5:30 PM today and a second broadcast at 8:20 PM. (Haitong Agency, 30th)

Berlin In celebration of the eighth anniversary of the establishment of the Nazi regime, Hitler broadcast to the nation, stating that anyone who wants to aid Britain must know that every ship that approaches our torpedo tubes will be sunk. If the United States attempts to intervene in the European war, our objectives will immediately change. Britain's claim to world hegemony has failed due to the rise of the German-Italian alliance in Europe. It is futile to speculate on any differences between Germany and Italy, or that Italy will no longer be able to fight. It is equally futile to fabricate claims that a revolution will occur in Italy. If Britain believes that Italy's occasional failures are evidence of its victory, then I cannot understand it. He ended by saying that since the New Year, our military preparations have been more complete than ever before in Germany. This spring, we will begin a submarine offensive, at which time the enemy will know that we have not been idle. We are confident that we will achieve victory. After Hitler's speech, Propaganda Minister Goebbels shouted, "Under the leadership of the Führer, we obey and follow!" (Reuters, 30th)

International Anecdotes (1)

### Recent Developments in Japanese Politics

Former Publisher of the Japan Gazette, Mr. Hugh Byas, has returned to the United States. This newspaper has already translated and published one of his "Uncensored Reports," titled "The Current Stage of Deteriorating US-Japan Relations." We now translate and record another, titled "Recent Developments in Japanese Politics," as follows:

Japan is currently facing serious disputes over both domestic and foreign policy issues. Domestically, the government, in its pursuit of a totalitarian policy, has established the so-called New Order. However, extreme factions still hold widely divergent views on how to implement this New Order. In terms of foreign policy, one faction supports the government's friendly approach to the Soviet Union, while another faction completely distrusts the Soviets.

On July 5th of last year, a political conspiracy occurred in Japan. At that time, a group of radical elements calling themselves "Divine Soldiers" attempted to assassinate former Prime Minister Admiral Minei and Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira. On the same day, Japanese police arrested twenty-eight "Divine Soldiers," but Army Artillery Colonel Hashimoto, the suspected mastermind, remained at large and has since been appointed as a director in the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, the guiding organization of the New Order.

Hashimoto served as the commander of Japanese artillery along the Yangtze River in December 1937. The incident involving the American gunboat "Panay" and the British warship "Ladybird" was instigated by him. He is the leader of the ultranationalist Japanese Youth Party, which has five million members, giving him the power to influence the New Order movement.

Other signs of instability are everywhere. However, this does not mean that the era of military supremacy is about to end; it is merely a case of infighting among extremist elements. Japanese liberals have all retreated, and liberalism is now regarded as "treasonous" under totalitarian rule.

The extent of the power of Japanese extremist elements can be seen from the shocking actions of seventeen "Divine Soldiers." These "Divine Soldiers" are being tried by the Tokyo High Court for their conspiracy to assassinate the late Admiral Saito and many senior government officials in 1936. Last month, when the court summoned the defendants and Chief Prosecutor Mitsuhashi read out the indictment, the defendants, claiming that Mitsuhashi did not understand the New Order, refused to listen to the indictment and walked out of the courtroom. At that time, Chief Prosecutor Mitsuhashi requested the judge to take necessary steps to maintain order in the court, rectify the national discipline, and prevent the judicial system from being severely affected. However, after some deliberation, the judge ordered the prosecutor to proceed with reading the indictment regardless of whether the defendants were present.

A week later, many assassins, including those who assassinated former Prime Minister Hamaguchi, former Finance Minister Inoue, and former Mitsui Company President Takuma Dan, were granted amnesty on the occasion of the 2600th anniversary of the founding of Japan and regained their freedom. All of this proves the growing power of the extremist faction.

The current Prime Minister Konoe successfully formed a cabinet last July, but it was preceded by a bloodless revolution. It was generally believed that since he had taken office for the second time, he would become a dictatorial prime minister or would remain in office for ten years, unlike the recent frequent changes. However, the current situation makes it difficult for Konoe to stay in his position for long. The infighting among extremist elements puts him in a dilemma. There are even rumors that the "Divine Soldiers" would attempt to snipe at Konoe, and that a bullet grazed his arm, but this could not be verified.

Japanese extremist elements are divided into two factions: one faction advocates that Konoe should become a national leader under the protection of the Emperor; the other faction hopes that Konoe or someone else can take complete control of power, similar to European dictators.

The majority of them advocate loyalty to the Emperor. They believe that the fundamental difference between European totalitarianism and Japanese totalitarianism lies in the fact that the position of the Japanese Emperor is supreme and must remain so forever. Konoe and others may become national leaders or heads of government, but they must not infringe on imperial power. Konoe himself also holds this view and seems to have no ambition to emulate Hitler or Mussolini. However, there are also those who hope that Konoe will thoroughly implement dictatorship and restore the state of the Tokugawa shogunate.

The New Order movement was vigorously promoted last September and seemed to have permeated every sector of national life, but in recent months it has declined due to resistance from the lower classes and difficulties in implementation. Japanese newspapers have recently emphasized that in order to revive the system, further efforts are needed.

Japan's foreign policy is also becoming increasingly chaotic. The Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy is not taken seriously. Japan's initial decision to join the pact was not based on any rational policy. The main reason was that some pro-German and Italian elements, such as former Ambassador to Italy Shiratori, promoted it behind the scenes.

After the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, the Konoe Cabinet has now taken a further step to become friendly with the Soviet Union and plans to negotiate a non-aggression pact with it. The Soviet Union had originally proposed to conclude such a pact with Japan eight years ago, but it was ignored by Japan. It is somewhat strange that it is being brought up again now.

However, Japanese public opinion and the military, who oppose compromise with the Soviet Union, still hold an important position. Since the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, the Japanese have always regarded the Soviet Union as a sworn enemy, and most people still distrust the Soviets. Soldiers who participated in the Russo-Japanese War find it even harder to forget the psychology of shared hatred. Among them, General Araki and others are still influential figures in this radical faction and have publicly opposed Konoe.

However, the issue of the Dutch East Indies is causing a major accident in the Pacific. The Japanese are divided into two factions on this issue: one faction advocates using diplomacy to obtain the best conditions for developing the economy of the region; the other faction advocates seizing the resources of the South Pacific regardless of the consequences.

Because Japan cannot conquer China, it wants to find another way out to compensate for its losses. If Japan can obtain the resources of the Dutch East Indies, then regardless of the outcome of the war in China, it will be considered a successful undertaking.

The Konoe Cabinet originally did not intend to adopt a radical policy to seize the Dutch East Indies, but after Minister of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi recently visited the region to negotiate with the Dutch authorities and returned empty-handed, Japan became impatient again and was eager to try.

In short, Japan now has only one consistent view: to end the war with China as quickly as possible. Japan's "New Order in East Asia" has now exceeded its limits and regards the war in China as a restraint on its other major developments.

### Special Taxpayers Meeting Actively Preparing; Japanese Side Declares Refusal to Attend; Has Absolutely No Impact on Quorum; Police Authorities Adopt Strict Precautions

The Special Taxpayers' Meeting, which was formally announced by the Danish Consul-General in Shanghai and Chairman of the Consular Body, Mr. Hille, to be reconvened at 2:30 PM on February 5th at the Grandstand of the Racecourse, has been met with great concern from all parties regarding the circumstances and outcome of the meeting. However, according to Japanese newspapers yesterday morning, Japanese taxpayers will not participate in the February 5th reconvened meeting. However, the Municipal Council believes that Japanese Consul-General Horiuchi has already given assurances that the same incident will not occur again if the meeting is reconvened. Therefore, they are still preparing to reconvene on schedule, and the police authorities have adopted various strict precautionary measures to prevent unforeseen circumstances.

Japanese Taxpayers Refuse to Attend

According to Japanese newspapers, the decision of Japanese taxpayers to refuse to participate in the February 5th meeting was made at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Japanese Residents' Road Association the day before. The reason is that Japanese Taxpayers' Association President Yugichi Hayashi has fully criticized the Municipal Council's financial policies and has clearly expressed the opposition of Japanese taxpayers to the original proposal to increase taxes by 40%. This decision was submitted to the Japanese Taxpayers' Association for discussion by the Road Associations yesterday. Therefore, the Standing Committee of the Association held a special meeting at the Japanese General Assembly Hall at 1:00 PM yesterday, to discuss the decision not to participate in the Special Meeting and to elect a new chairman to replace former Chairman Yugichi Hayashi, who was arrested and detained by the Japanese Consular Police for shooting Municipal Council Chairman Cornell and thus, it is generally speculated that this decision will be passed by the Association. When the Special Meeting reconvenes on February 5th, there will be no one in the Japanese taxpayers' seats.

Meeting Can Reach Quorum

It is believed that the reason why Japanese taxpayers refuse to participate in the reconvened Special Meeting is to attempt to make the meeting lack a quorum and postpone it again. However, according to a Municipal Council official yesterday morning, the quorum for the Special Taxpayers' Meeting is one-third of the total number of eligible votes, and the number of Japanese votes (not the number of Japanese taxpayers) is estimated to be less than half of the total number (estimated at 28,000 votes). Therefore, unless a majority of non-Japanese taxpayers are absent, even if all Japanese taxpayers do not participate at the time, the meeting will still reach a quorum, and the resolutions passed will be completely valid. It is predicted that when the meeting is reconvened on February 5th, because the proposals that have already been discussed will not be repeated, only the voting on the amendments proposed by the Japanese on the tax increase case will begin. The program will be reduced by half, so the meeting is expected to end within an hour. It is believed that the proposal to increase the Municipal General Tax, Land Tax, and Additional Tax proposed by the Municipal Council Board of Directors will be passed at that time.

Temporary Borrowing to Meet Urgent Needs

As for the Municipal Council's tax revenue, because of the delay in the Special Taxpayers' Meeting's decision on the tax increase case, the total amount of spring rates, house rates, and land rates due at the beginning of this year, estimated at more than 15 million yuan, has not yet been collected. It was originally hoped that it would be collected immediately after the meeting passed it on the 23rd, but it was postponed due to an accident. Therefore, the Municipal Council's financial authorities may temporarily borrow money to meet the necessary expenses at the end of this month, such as staff salaries and debt interest. According to the tax increase case decided by the Municipal Council Board of Directors, it will be implemented from January this year until the annual meeting of taxpayers in April. The tax rate after that will be decided at the annual meeting. According to the report of Municipal Council Chairman Cornell at the Special Taxpayers' Meeting on the 23rd, if this additional tax is implemented after April, the budget for this year will still be in deficit because the Municipal Council's budget for this year has increased significantly due to increased staff allowances, and expenses have increased by 20 million yuan.

Hayashi Yugichi Has Already Received Preliminary Trial

According to the English-language North China Daily News yesterday, the main suspect in the Racecourse case, Yugichi Hayashi, has been given a preliminary trial by the Japanese Consular Court in this port on charges of premeditated murder. He was escorted to the Consular Court on Monday. Consular officials searched for detailed evidence and formally filed charges. According to reliable sources, the day after the incident, Hayashi Yugichi will be sent to Nagasaki, Japan, for a full trial after a preliminary hearing by the Japanese Consular Court, and will be punished according to Japanese law. However, people are quite interested and suspicious about whether Hayashi Yugichi will be sent to Nagasaki and whether he will be punished after being sent to Nagasaki. According to the Japanese-language Dalu Xinbao, after the Japanese Consular Court detained Hayashi Yugichi on charges of premeditated murder, Kato, the prosecutor of the Japanese Consular Court, and Japanese officials escorted Hayashi Yugichi to the scene of the incident at the Grandstand of the Racecourse at 2:30 PM on the 27th to conduct an on-site inspection. Hayashi Yugichi narrated the process of shooting Municipal Council Chairman Cornell and Japanese Director Okamoto at that time for forty minutes. According to Hayashi Yugichi's reply to the Dalu Xinbao reporter's question, "I was the one who shot. Now I am waiting for all the consequences." He had nothing to say.

New Ballots Reissued

The Municipal Council Secretariat has decided to reissue new ballots in the near future because most of the ballots issued to taxpayers for use in the Special Meeting have been lost. The ballots are finely printed with silk-colored card stock. Taxpayers can enter the venue with this ballot. Except for special circumstances, foreigners are generally prohibited from entering the venue. At that time, the police authorities will send Chinese, English, Japanese, and Indian police officers to check tickets at the entrance of the venue and will be on strict guard inside and outside the venue and around the podium to maintain security and ensure safety. In addition, the venue layout has been renovated after being damaged in the previous meeting due to the chaotic order. At that time, the clean seats on the Grandstand, the beautiful flower decorations around the podium, and the tall and complete reed shed will meet more than 4,000 foreign taxpayers and foreign directors of the Municipal Council.

Another Suggestion for Increasing Taxes

Yesterday, a Westerner sent a letter to the North China Daily News, suggesting taxing the stock exchange to strengthen the Municipal Council's finances. It stated: "When Chairman Cornell answered the proposal at the last Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting, he said that if there were any proposals on taxation methods, as long as the proposal was within its statutory capabilities, the Municipal Council would always be prepared to give it close and detailed consideration. I hereby request the Municipal Council to consider increasing the tax rate on any affairs related to the exchange by 1%. You can see from the table below that you can get a lot of money by using this method. (The following table shows the past transaction volume) January 3, 43,042,900 yuan, January 10, 52,928,700 yuan, January 17, 92,852,100 yuan, January 24, 69,034,300 yuan. In summary, 358,858,000 yuan. If a 1% tax is levied (a tax of 5 per mille is levied on sellers and buyers), the total amount is 2,588,580 yuan, then the total amount for one year will be 33,651,540 yuan. Subtracting the estimated lack of expenses will be 13,651,540 yuan. Then use the method of increasing the license fees for cars and dogs (both are luxury goods), or it may exceed 14 million yuan, which can be used to pay the Municipal Council's debts and reduce the Municipal Council's liabilities. If this method is implemented, it will definitely not cause difficulties in the Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting. I believe that the proposal meeting will definitely be passed unanimously, and the unsightly actions in the last meeting can be avoided."

### Various Industries Resume Business Today; Huihua Banks Had Excellent Business Performance Last Year; The One with the Highest Profit Made About One Million Yuan

The member banks of the Banking Industry Association and the member banks of the Foreign Merchants' Banking Association have resumed business yesterday after the three-day Spring Festival holiday. The member banks of the Money Industry Association, as well as the Fulu Shouxi Money Exchange Shops of the Money Exchange Industry Association, will report to the association this morning to be listed. It is heard that except for Zikang Ruiji Bank, which will be changed to a limited company, and Huifeng Bank, which will postpone listing, the remaining 41 Huihua Banks, such as Fuyuan Bank, will be fully listed. Although the Money Exchange Shops are scheduled to be listed today, they have actually resumed trading yesterday because the foreign exchange, gold, and foreign currency markets have already opened red. As for the newly established limited liability money shops, they will open successively.

Red Trading

In addition to gold, stocks, foreign exchange, and foreign currencies, which resumed trading with red trading yesterday, the commodity markets such as soybeans, grains, cotton cloth, yarn, sugar, medicinal materials, hardware, paper, etc. will resume tea market today and open red trading. Various factories have scheduled to start work, and various companies and firms will fully resume business today. Various string shops will resume sending folders in advance today, so as to communicate with various industries, and it is scheduled to be completed before the Lantern Festival.

Opening Interbank Lending Rate

According to the interbank lending rate market in the city, the Ningbo Road Money Industry Market, has issued a public notice in the market yesterday, allowing interbank lending rates to be opened as usual at 8:45 am on January 31. However, during the Spring Festival period, only the morning market will be open, and the afternoon market will be temporarily suspended. The afternoon market at 12:45 will be resumed after the Lantern Festival. The Bank Note Exchange has resumed exchange yesterday, but the Money Industry Note Exchange will begin today. It is also heard that the Money Industry Association will hold an annual meeting on a regular basis. In addition to the public sacrifice of the former directors, it will also discuss the new business policies after listing. The Money Exchange Industry Association will hold an executive committee meeting and invite various member shops to participate to discuss business issues.

Last Year's Business

In the 29th year of the Republic of China, the money industry and the Huihua banks, because they strictly abide by laws and regulations and only deposit and lend interest and calculate it on a daily basis, their profits are more than in previous years. It is heard that a certain bank made a profit of 1.02 million yuan, ranking first in the money industry. However, various money exchange shops buy and sell foreign currencies, operate foreign exchange, gold, securities, and engage in speculative transactions, so their profits are quite high. It is heard that many have made millions of profits, especially the shops that speculate in gold. In terms of various industries, the ones with the highest profits are hardware, cotton yarn, cloth, groceries, etc.

### Cornell Attended the Bureau Yesterday with Illness

Municipal Council Chairman Cornell was injured in the last Foreign Taxpayers' Congress. Fortunately, the injury was minor. He was only hospitalized for three days and returned to his private residence to recuperate. Yesterday noon, the Chairman went to the Bureau with his injury to work. His actions were as usual, but his left hand was still wrapped in bandages and attached to his neck. He decided to continue to attend the next reconvened Taxpayers' Congress.

### Roosevelt's Birthday Celebrated Privately by American僑民

The North China Daily News reported that today (30th) is the 58th birthday of US President Roosevelt. The American僑民 in Shanghai will not celebrate it formally, but there will be many gatherings on the private side to commemorate it. President Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, in Hyde Park, New York. He studied at Harvard University and Columbia Law School. After graduating from school, he practiced law for many years. From 1910, he served as a member of the New York State Assembly. He resigned in 1913 and was transferred to serve as the Deputy Secretary of the Navy. In 1929, he was elected as the Governor of New York. In 1932, he was the Democratic presidential candidate. In January 1933, he was first inaugurated. In 1937, he was elected again. In 1940, he was re-elected as the third president. Roosevelt married Ms. Eleanor in 1905 and had five children. Traditionally, the entire United States holds banquets today to celebrate President Roosevelt's birthday, and the proceeds are transferred to charity.

### American Relief Wheat

For example, telegraphs sent to various parts of the country and transferred through Hong Kong, including those in foreign languages and Chinese passwords, will be 1.2 yuan per word, and those in Chinese code will be 6 cents per word. Urgent telegrams will be doubled as usual. Telegraphs sent to Hong Kong will maintain the original price for the time being. As for telegraphs sent abroad, they will be decided after the General Directorate decides.

### During the Period of the Surge of Foreign Rice, Prevent Hoarding for Profit; The Rice Price Increase During the Spring Festival Last Year Can Serve as a Lesson

The rice market will open today, and foreign rice will surge, and the price will fall. However, compared with the rice price of 40 yuan per stone last year and 85 yuan this year, the price per stone has increased by more than 40 yuan. In the summary of the eastern period last year, due to the high rice price, rice merchants saw that it was profitable, so they ordered a large number from foreign producing areas. After the Spring Festival, due to the large influx of foreign rice, each rice store had a trend of being unable to accommodate it, and the inventory reached more than one million bags, resulting in a sharp drop of more than 10 yuan per stone of rice. However, it was later acquired by speculators who had a large amount of floating capital, resulting in a further increase in the rice price at that time, reaching 100 yuan per stone.

Current Situation of the Rice Market

The current decline in rice prices due to the influx of a large amount of foreign rice is expected. However, after the decline, it is still necessary to prevent speculators from hoarding for profit and causing prices to rise again. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions will prepare a proper method in advance. Before there are concrete methods, market transactions must comply with the method of selling to customers and businesses, and businesses selling to shops, so that the food prospects of the citizens can be assured.

Continued Shipping of Ordered Rice

The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association's 8,718 bags of ordered No. 2 Saigon foreign rice were loaded on the Hua Lun Foreign Firm "Gelan" before the end of last year and arrived in port. They have been sent to the ordering households by car. However, only one or two ordering households, such as the cooked water industry, will leave the station after the Spring Festival holiday. According to the association's report, the above-mentioned 8,718 bags of ordered rice are allocated to the 22nd to 29th batches of ordering households. There are also 4,000 bags that have been traded and will be shipped to Shanghai by a cargo ship within days. At that time, they will be allocated to the 30th batch of ordering households and will continue to register and order.

Actual Number of Rice Arriving

During the Spring Festival, the influx of foreign rice into Shanghai was strong. The various situations have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Due to omissions during the holiday period, they are re-explored as follows: The Taikoo Company's Zhejiang ship arrived in Shanghai on the 24th, with 7,532 bags of foreign rice loaded from Siam and 9,618 bags from Hong Kong. The Kunming ship arrived in Shanghai on the 27th, also carrying 12,336 bags from Siam and 6,104 bags from Hong Kong. The Haikou ship arrived on the same day, carrying 10,029 bags from Hong Kong, and another 399 bags were originally shipped to Qingdao. The Jinan ship arrived on the 28th, carrying 12,246 bags from Hong Kong. The Jardine Matheson's Hesheng ship arrived in Shanghai the day before (29th), carrying 16,423 bags from Hong Kong. The above-mentioned, except for those transferred to Qingdao, totaled 74,288 bags, which, together with those reported yesterday, totaled 200,985 bags. There are still a large number of Burmese, Siamese, and Vietnamese foreign rice coming in the future.

### Good Labor-Management Relations in Six Telegraph Companies

Five Demands Made by Messengers; Most Accepted by the Companies

The messengers of the six telegraph companies, American Pacific Submarine Telegraph Company, British Datong Submarine Telegraph Company, Danish Dabe Submarine Telegraph Company, American News Agency, Universal Wireless Radio Station, and Coast Radio Station, jointly submitted a written reason to the six companies at the end of last year due to the high cost of living and the inability to maintain a livelihood. They asked the six companies to increase wages and improve treatment, totaling five items. It is learned that the authorities of the six companies believe that the demands made by the messengers are purely a matter of livelihood and have no other purpose. They are deeply understanding and have accepted most of the five demands made by the messengers. The messengers believe that the company authorities are quite sincere, so the labor and management are now completely harmonious.

### Procedures for Passengers to Carry Banknotes to the Mainland

The Ministry of Finance telegraphed that passengers carrying banknotes to the border provinces for circulation, but not for export, should first apply to the Ministry of Finance for a Ministry Certificate, or report to the Ministry of Finance for special approval, and order the customs to inspect and release them if the amount carried is more than 3,000 yuan. If the passengers have to advance and cannot temporarily handle the above procedures, the competent customs should temporarily detain the excess banknotes carried, and then inspect, release, or return them after they have obtained the Ministry Certificate or reported to the Ministry for approval.

### 愷自邇路 Yesterday Morning Bloodshed: Ji Xiangqing Shot Dead, Two Men in Black Gowns Lay in Wait at the Alley Entrance, Firing Four Shots, Two Bullets Striking Ji's Vitals

Yesterday morning at approximately 9:45 AM, an assassination occurred at the entrance of Zhilanfang Alley on Route Cardinal Foch in the French Concession. The victim was Ji Xiangqing, the general manager of Huiyuan Bank. He was struck by two bullets on the spot, injuring vital organs, and died shortly thereafter. The details are recorded below:

Opening a Bank: Self-Appointed Manager

Ji Xiangqing was a native of Jiangyin, 36 years old, and resided in the west wing of the second floor of No. 7 Zhilanfang, 174 Route Cardinal Foch in the French Concession. He opened Huiyuan Bank in Room 94 of the Dabuilding on Ningbo Road in the International Settlement, serving as general manager. He also concurrently served as a "Commissioner of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank." He owned a private car, license plate number 3438. At the end of the Qingli calendar year last year, he hired Chen Heying (34 years old), a native of Ningbo, as his chauffeur.

Suddenly Shot: Bullets Strike Vitals

Yesterday morning at approximately 9:45 AM, Ji, as usual, went to the Huiyuan Bank to work. At the time, Ji was wearing a dark blue Western suit, a leather overcoat, a dark gray felt hat, and leather shoes. As he entered the car like a prosperous merchant, and just as he drove out of the alley entrance, two men in black gowns were lying in wait on the inside. Spotting Ji's car approaching, they pulled out pistols and quickly fired four bullets at Ji. All the bullets pierced through the glass window, and two bullets struck his vitals – one bullet hitting his right temple and the other hitting the back of his head. Blood gushed out like a fountain, and he collapsed in extreme pain. The shooters, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled with their weapons.

Dying Without Medical Attention: Breathing Ceases, Life Ends

After the incident, the alley gatekeeper and police officers arrived upon hearing the commotion. Seeing that Ji's breath was faint, they urgently telegraphed the French police station and also sent the chauffeur, Lu Heying, back to the residence to report the news to Ji's wife, Madam Shen (31 years old, native of Wuxi). She rushed out to see him, but Ji was already unconscious. Soon, Chinese and foreign detectives from the police station arrived by car, inspected the scene, and then summoned an ambulance to rush Ji to Guangci Hospital on Jinshenfu Road for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died approximately twenty minutes later.

Cause of Assassination: Still Under Investigation

The body was transported to the autopsy room at the Delastour Road Small Hospital. It is reported that Ji has four young children. Police officers reportedly found several bullet casings at the scene of the incident and immediately took them back to the police station for inspection in order to track down the perpetrators. According to news from the Huaguang News Agency, Ji has been quite active in banking and financial circles recently. The current strict investigation being conducted by the French police concerns whether this sudden assassination is related to politics. Ji originally did not plan to go to the Huiyuan Bank yesterday morning, but before 9 AM, someone, falsely claiming to be a friend surnamed Mou, sent someone to Ji's house, urging him to go to the bank to discuss something. Only then did Ji respond to the call and leave the house, leading to his death by shooting.

### British One-Armed General Suggests Linking China and India Transportation, Using Chinese Products to Trade for Large Quantities of Military Supplies from Chongqing to the Bay of Bengal, India

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Mr. Sutton, a 56-year-old Englishman, once served as a major general under the old warlord Zhang Zuolin. Because he had no right arm, he was known as the "One-Armed" General. Currently, he is doing business in Hong Kong. Recently, he came to Shanghai to purchase machinery. He told reporters that he first brought mortars to China in 1921, going up the Yangtze River to Chongqing, and planned with General Yang Sen to set up an arsenal in Chongqing to manufacture mortars. Now, the Chinese army widely uses mortars. Sutton also said that China could build a light road from Chongqing to India, using human power to transport important export products from Free China such as tung oil, hides, and silk. Once they reach India, they can be transported by Indian railways to the Bay of Bengal and shipped overseas. On the return trip, military supplies can be transported back to China. Sutton concluded by saying that he hopes that after China achieves peace, it can control the flooding of the Yangtze River and control the water flow of the Yangtze River Gorges to generate electricity, and turn Hankou, which is rich in iron sand, into a large steel industry city comparable to Pittsburgh in the United States.

### Japanese Monopoly Plan for Inland River Navigation in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, Foreign Businesses Unable to Gain a Foothold, Chinese Businesses Entirely Excluded, Will Undoubtedly Be Limited by Guerrilla Activities

According to sources in the navigation industry, the Japanese "Central China Inland River Shipping Company" has drafted a plan to control the entire inland river navigation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The content is extremely large. It expands a line north of the Yangtze River, expanding from the existing Nantong-Rufu line through Dongtai and Taixian to Xiannvmiao, and then westward to Bengbu and Huaiyuan. In the south of the Yangtze River, it expands twelve lines, with Suzhou, Changzhou, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Shanghai, Kunshan, Danyang as the center.

Extending Shipping Routes

Each extends to nearby areas rich in products. It is said that this plan will be gradually implemented this year. In addition, the Japanese side also plans to open three canals between Jiaxing and Haining, between Jiaxing and Haiyan, and between Jiaxing and Gongchen Bridge, which will begin operation next month. Furthermore, according to the navigation industry, before the war, the inland river navigation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was very developed by Chinese and foreign businesses.

Excluding Dissidents

Since the occupation, foreign businesses have been forced to stop by 90%, and most Chinese businesses have also been devastated. Only a few have barely managed to survive out of necessity. The decline is incomparable to before the war. This Japanese plan will undoubtedly be restricted by guerrilla activities. However, if it is gradually implemented, not only will foreign businesses be unable to gain a foothold, but Chinese businesses will also be entirely excluded.

### Salvation Army Golden Jubilee

75 Years Since Founding

The Rotary Club of this city held a weekly luncheon yesterday to celebrate 75 years since founding. Salvation Army Morais spoke, saying that the Salvation Army has decided to raise 175,000 yuan this year to engage in various charitable undertakings. During his speech, Morais recalled the history of the Salvation Army, saying that the organization was founded by William Booth 75 years ago and has now reached the "Diamond Jubilee." The organization's flag is now flying in 97 countries around the world. Salvation Army members do not have fixed salaries. The organization sometimes has economic difficulties, and even the money to buy food for its staff is scarce. Morais then listed various plans to be carried out by the group, as well as the number of people and expenses needed. The beggar shelter currently accommodates 1,052 beggars, including two newly born babies. The shelter hopes to help those familiar with making a living and soon be able to resume their old careers. After the luncheon, Rotary Club President Bosaiven gave a brief speech, stating that establishing a beggar shelter is a benevolent act, and the Rotary Club is very interested in it. When mentioning the Salvation Army, he said that the organization has "revealed the spirit of Christ without reservation."

### Impersonating Woodhead, Distributing Circulars

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Woodhead, the editor of the "Oriental Affairs" magazine, received a letter this morning (the 30th) with great surprise, because the letter was a printed circular issued by L.K. Kentwell, the editor of the "China New Voice" magazine in Nanjing, with an attached piece of paper that prominently read "Edited by Woodhead, China Yearbook and Oriental Magazine." These words are the same as those used by Woodhead to return manuscripts, but the font is different. Woodhead does not know if Kentwell sent the same letter with this piece of paper to others, but he wants to explain that these pieces of paper are all forged fakes. What makes Woodhead particularly embarrassed is that the letter advocates that "the British-ruled Shanghai International Settlement must be immediately returned to its rightful owner, China." (According to another report, Kentwell is a pseudonym for lawyer Gan Weilu.)

### Shanghai Municipal Council Releases Last Year's Shanghai Living Statistics, Rice, Rent, Coal Balls Skyrocket, Making Life Difficult, Minimum Living Expenses for a Family Require More Than 100 Yuan

According to the statistics section report of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department in the Shanghai Municipal Council's annual report for last year, due to the rapid increase in the cost of living recently, the monthly living cost index for Chinese workers and Western expatriates compiled and released by this department and the study of workers' actual income are quite useful for adjusting workers' income. Many stores and factories adjust according to the changes in this index. This department also issues an average retail price list every week, which is used as a standard for rice subsidies and commodity allowances. In addition, those who come to this department to inquire about this issue are answered in detail. From this, it can be seen that the materials provided by this department are very important in social services. The main points are as follows: (A) The living conditions in Shanghai in 1940.

Western Expatriate Living

The Bureau and the public expected very high numbers, so the average quantity of household consumption obtained from the survey in the three months from October to December 1939 was used as the weight, and the provisional living cost index for Western expatriates in this city was first compiled.

Composite Index: The retail prices in 1940 rose month by month, so the overall trend of the provisional composite living cost index for Western expatriates also continued to rise without ever falling back. The index for this year was 149.15, starting at 114.48 at the beginning of the year and reaching 180.21 in December, an increase of 65.73 points compared to January, with an average monthly increase of 6.41 points. Compared to the base period of October 1939, the purchasing power of the national currency decreased by 12.65% in January and continued to decrease to 44.51% in December. In the twelve months, the total index for American expatriates increased by 59.41 points, the British by 62.78, the Russians by 67.61, and other expatriates by 66.62 points, among which the increase in the index for Russian expatriates was the highest.

Chinese Workers Living

The total living cost index for workers increased from 203.25 last year to 438.22 this year. Compared to the currency value in 1936, the purchasing power of the national currency also jumped from 4 jiao 9 fen 2 li last year to 2 jiao 2 fen 8 li 2 hao this year, a decrease of 2 jiao 6 fen 3 li 8 hao. The total index for this year was lower only in March, April, and August. The total index for December was 579.70, an increase of 254.26 points compared to January, with an average monthly increase of 232 points. In January of this year, the purchasing power of the national currency was still 3 jiao 0 fen 7 li 3 hao, but it decreased to 1 jiao 7 fen 2 li 5 hao in December. The largest increase this year was in the food category, followed by miscellaneous items, clothing, fuel, and rent. At the end of the year, the food category index had exceeded the 650 mark, the fuel category was at 550, and the miscellaneous category was at 450.

In the retail prices in the index, the weights of rice, fuel, and rent are heavier than others for worker consumption goods, and among these three, rice is the heaviest. Generally, all goods have increased in price, but the increase in these three is of great concern and should be discussed separately. (a) Rice: Before the incident, the retail price of No. 2 japonica rice was only 11.066 yuan per stone, and No. 1 indica rice was 10.373 yuan. In February of this year, the price of No. 2 japonica rice rose to 45.427 yuan, and No. 1 indica rice was replaced by No. 2 Saigon rice, which also rose to 45.312 yuan. In March, the price of No. 2 Saigon rice fell slightly, but due to insufficient rainfall and a large contraction in foreign exchange in May, the price rose again. It fell back again in August and has continued to increase since October, reaching 81.802 yuan per stone, an increase of 120.49% compared to January of this year and 688.61% compared to July 1937.

(b) Coal Balls: In July 1937, the average price was only 1.100 yuan per 100 catties. It was 1.947 yuan in 1938 and 2.573 yuan last year. It was 4.277 yuan in January of this year and rose to 8.150 yuan in May. It fell slightly from June to September and rose again in October, reaching 8.388 yuan in December, an increase of 96.12% compared to January and 662.55% compared to July 1937.

(c) Rent: In the six months from July to December of this year, the rent for flat houses increased by 17.76% compared to last year and 278.55% compared to July 1937. The rent for stone gate buildings increased by 28.01% compared to last year and 239.66% compared to July 1937. The increase in rent not only increases the burden but also leads to crowded living conditions, and the health problems are even more serious.

Factors Affecting the Cost of Living

Although wholesale prices fell and foreign exchange improved in some months of this year, retail prices did not fall, so the living expenses of Chinese workers and Western expatriates did not improve as a result. Wholesale prices rose the most sharply in the first five months of this year and fell back in June, July, and August, and then rose again. When wholesale prices rise, retail prices also rise accordingly, but from June to August, retail prices did not decrease, and the impact on living expenses is self-evident. The foreign exchange rate fluctuates from time to time, and the impact on living expenses is less desirable than a low and stable rate. Once the exchange rate contracts, prices rise sharply, but they remain the same for a long time, so the more frequent the fluctuations, the higher the prices will be, and there will be no decrease in the bottom line. A linked study of the monthly fluctuations of retail prices and foreign exchange rates can prove this. (B) Wages and working hours (limited to Chinese factories) (to be continued)

### Payment Method for Unified Debt Principal and Interest, Telegram to Chongqing for Instructions

The National Debt Fund Management Committee agreed with the four banks, namely the Central Bank, China Bank, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank, that the four banks will discount and pay for the unified revival gold long-term three bonds guaranteed by customs duties. The tenth principal and interest payment of the unified public bonds of the Republic of China in 1936, namely the B, C, D, and E bond tickets, is scheduled for January 31 according to the regulations. The Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank has telegraphed the head office in Chongqing for instructions and has received a reply approving the start of discounting and payment from today. However, the bondholders must first fill out an application form and obtain a discount voucher from the paying bank, and then pay it off in six installments. The tenth principal and interest will be fully paid off by June 30. As for whether Shanghai will handle the discount payment, the reply did not mention it. The Shanghai Branch has telegraphed the head office again for instructions. The reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired at the Shanghai Branch last night but has not yet received a reply from the head office. The payment method and principles have been completely determined. Whether to pay in Shanghai or in Hong Kong and other domestic locations must wait for a reply before proceeding. It is expected that a reply will be received this morning.

### Niloria Unharmed, Arrived in Shanghai the Other Day, Not Lost in the Pacific Ocean, German Raider Active Near Bismarck Island

According to the Shanghai Times, the Eastern and Australian Steamship Company's Niloria was overdue at the beginning of this month and did not arrive in Manila, causing some to worry that the ship had sunk. It was then reported that the ship had delayed its voyage to rescue survivors from a ship sunk by a German raider near Bismarck Island.

Ordered to Depart from the Route

Yesterday (the 29th), the ship arrived in Shanghai and moored at the old Ningbo Wharf. According to reports, the Niloria was recently on its way from Rabaul on New Britain Island in the Pacific Ocean to Manila when it received orders to depart from its route.

Transferring Rescued Passengers

It went to Imaru Island and rescued 496 survivors sent to the island by a German raider. It sailed to Brisbane, Australia, waited for the survivors to disembark, and then changed course to Manila. At the end of December last year, a German raider was active in the northeast of the Australian-administered Bismarck Islands.

Once All Communication Lost

Because the Niloria was out of contact after sailing out of Rabaul, the shipping industry was concerned that the ship had been intercepted by a German raider in the Pacific Ocean. However, by the 8th of this month, news of the Niloria's safety arrived, and the public no longer speculated about the ship's fate.

### 53 Japanese Planes Raid Ningbo in Formation

Ningbo Alarms Constant

According to reliable sources in the navigation industry, Japanese warships and planes have again harassed Zhejiang Province in recent days, but without major losses. At dawn on the 26th, a Japanese warship outside Zhenhai port suddenly bombarded the Jiangnan fortress area from a distance and stopped after a while without causing major damage.

### Economic Investigation of National Goods List, Shanghai Manufacturers All File Reports

In order to protect the production of national goods and prevent the malpractice of counterfeiting national goods, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has issued national goods certificates separately for identification. However, in order to conduct strict inspections to avoid mixing genuine and fake goods, the Ministry previously issued a notice to the provincial and municipal governments that the regulations for the issuance of national goods certificates by the Ministry have been promulgated and implemented. However, the internal organization of large and small manufacturers who have already received national goods certificates and various products have changed from time to time. If they are not inspected at any time, it is difficult to review them. For this reason, the Ministry has specially formulated implementation methods: (1) All manufacturers who have received national goods certificates shall fill in a statement of items every six months (half a year) and report it to the Ministry for record. The form is the same as the statement of items that should be filled in when applying for a national goods certificate. (2) The filled-in statement of items should be submitted to the local competent authority for transfer to the Ministry or sent to the local legal industrial and commercial organization for certification and directly submitted for verification. The certification procedures should be handled in accordance with the procedures for filling in and submitting the statement of items for applying for the issuance of a national goods certificate. The various national goods organizations and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce in this city have received the notice separately and will submit all the forms that should be filled in according to the prescribed date. It is now known that all the large and small national goods factories in this city, in view of the special environment and the prevalence of inferior goods in the market, and due to the impact of transportation stagnation, the export of national goods has declined, but in order to take care of future business, all have tried to improve all kinds of products, and all believe that this measure by the Ministry of Economic Affairs is indeed the only good way to eliminate the counterfeiting of national goods, so all have filled in the above forms separately and submitted them to their respective national goods organizations for transfer to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record.

### Shanghai-Zhejiang Line Has Generous Freight Rates, Risky Voyages

Baoli Decides to Sail to Wenzhou Again, Publicly Selling Tickets and Loading Cargo

The Yishang Huayi Shipping Company's Baoli ship originally sailed on the Shanghai-Zhejiang route, but because the shipping on this route was difficult in the past, the ship company avoided other accidents and changed its route to Jiangbei at the end of last year. Since the voyage, the business has been sluggish and has been suspended once. It is now heard that since the New Year, several foreign shipping companies in this city, because the Shanghai-Zhejiang line has generous freight rates, have continued to sail without considering the safety of the voyage. The Baoli ship has also decided to resume sailing on the Shanghai-Zhejiang line and is scheduled to set sail for Wenzhou on February 5. It will stop at the Roosevelt Wharf to load cargo and publicly sell passenger tickets tomorrow and the day after.

### Business Corps White Russian Volunteer Members Have Been Assigned to the American Team, Strengthening the Defense Strength of the Central District

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's International Business Corps transferred more than 300 White Russian hired members of the Corps' C-Character Battalion to the police department on the 15th of this month, the Corps' structure has lost its stability. According to an investigation by a reporter from Pingming News Agency, among them, there is still a platoon of White Russian volunteer members in the C-Character Battalion, which originally belonged to the C-Character Battalion. Now that the C Battalion cannot form a battalion, the Corps Commander decided to reorganize it, abolish the original C Battalion, and reorganize the remaining platoon of White Russian volunteer members into the B-Character Battalion of the American team. Because the American B-Character Battalion originally had a serious shortage of personnel and was responsible for the defense of the central district of the International Settlement, the responsibility was heavy. Now, after incorporating a platoon of White Russian volunteer members into the B-Character Battalion, the effectiveness in garrisoning the central district is very strong.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: I have just read the article "Yue Opera Queen Yao Shuijuan Attacked with Excrement" and "Real Estate Agent Zhou Xuesong Also Suffers Excrement Attack" published on page 4 of your newspaper on January 30th. The part about Jin Rongfa on Panxing Road does not quite match the facts. Rongfa has always served in the French Municipal Council, behaving himself and never having anything to do with Zhou Xuesong being attacked with excrement. Although Zhou Xuesong initially mistakenly identified him, reporting it to the police station, Zhou Xuesong later realized his mistake and withdrew the charges. Therefore, Rongfa was not detained by the police station, and there was no apology from his family to the Zhou family. The information in your newspaper is probably based on inaccurate rumors, but as it concerns Rongfa's reputation, I cannot remain silent. I am therefore writing to request your newspaper to promptly make a correction. Respectfully, Jin Rongfa, January 28th.

### Finance: Foreign Merchants Still Bringing in Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC rates. The unofficial market for British and American currency saw more demand than supply as Chinese and foreign banks reopened today after the Spring Festival holiday. This led to a softer trend. HSBC's sale of US dollars for next month has stabilized the market somewhat, favoring the purchase of this month's forward exchange rate at 3.82 yuan. Heavy absorption of US dollars and purchasing by importers at noon led to softening. In the afternoon, British firm Sassoon's entry made it difficult to escape the tight situation, eventually closing at 3 shillings 3.75 pence for British gold and 5.375 yuan for US dollars. Compared to the noon close on the 25th, British was 0.046875 pence tighter, and US dollars were 0.0625 yuan tighter. Trading was extremely active throughout the day.

Favorable Absorption of US Dollars

Early morning saw London cables report a recent drop of 0.0625 pence, while forward rates remained stable. New York silver prices remained steady, and London gold prices were stagnant. Exchange rates between Britain and the US, Shanghai, etc., remained unchanged. The US dollar was slightly stronger against the British pound, up by a quarter against Shanghai, and inactive against the French franc. Central bank rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3 shillings 4.375 pence for British gold and 5.4375 yuan for US dollars, which was unchanged for the US dollar and 0.015625 pence higher for the British pound compared to before the holiday (last Saturday). After opening, HSBC first sold US dollars for February at a rate of 5.375 yuan, and speculators released some, selling US dollars for January to Macao at 5.4375 yuan. However, the buying interest was strong, with foreign firms selling US dollars for January at 5.4375 yuan. At 9 o'clock, HSBC's rates were announced, and all exchange rates remained unchanged. The silver tax was low at 0.50 percent. Subsequently, Beneficial Securities sold off British gold for this month, leading to a slight softening, with rates at 3 shillings 4.0625 pence. At the same time, foreign firms had sudden needs, leading to even tighter potential, with February British gold settling with foreign firms at 3 shillings 3.4375 pence. The situation remained the same at noon, with the closing prices for spot and this month's US dollars at 5.40625 yuan and British gold at 3 shillings 3.75 pence. February US dollars were at 5.34375 yuan, and British gold was at 3 shillings 3.134375 pence.

Sassoon's Eager Buying

Sassoon had a strong buying intention in the aftermarket, and foreign banks were still willing to supply, resulting in a balanced market. Sassoon bought in large quantities, with current month Guangling at 3 shillings 3.75 pence, and the same month's US dollars at 5.40625 yuan. Later, trading gradually decreased, and the closing price stabilized, with US dollars continuing to slightly contract. Spot and this month were quoted at 5.375 yuan, British gold at 3 shillings 3.75 pence, next month's US dollars at 5.34375 yuan, and British gold at 3 shillings 3.4375 pence. Compared to the pre-holiday closing prices, British gold spot and forward contracts sharply contracted by 0.046875 pence, and US dollars near-term tightened by 0.0625 yuan, while long-term softened by 0.03125 yuan.

### Gold Market Desires to Rise, Then Returns

Spot is Already 30 Yuan Higher than Futures

Yesterday's spot gold dark market resumed trading as usual after the Spring Festival holiday. In the early morning, sentiment was buoyant, and the opening price immediately rose by 30 yuan compared to before the holiday, to 6,680 yuan. Driven by strong buying from Ren Chengyong and banking groups, it rose beyond the 700 yuan mark, reaching a high of 6,720 yuan. Later, due to sales from securities firms Dafeng and gold firm Taikangcheng, it was pushed down twice to 6,620 yuan. With support from banking groups and late purchases by Xinyuan and exchange dealers, it stabilized at a closing price of 6,650 yuan, equivalent to the pre-holiday closing price. Spot was reportedly 30 yuan higher than futures, prompting some to buy, with swaps done at 220 yuan. In the afternoon, the industry temporarily decided to close the market early, with only half-day trading, amounting to three to four thousand taels. Gold jewelry prices in gold shops remained unchanged, still quoted at 680 yuan. Customs duties, etc., were flat.

Burned Remnants Without Identity, Honor or Disgrace

Early in the morning, with invigorating sentiment, buying interest at the opening was quite strong. Banking groups initially traded 20 taels, at 6,680 yuan, 30 yuan higher than the closing price before the holiday (last Saturday). Ren Chengyong vigorously purchased hundreds of taels, and banking groups also bought, suddenly driving the price beyond the 700 yuan mark, with a high of 6,720 yuan. Subsequently, it fluctuated, and securities firm Dafeng and gold firm Taikangcheng sold, immediately causing a decline, retreating within the 700 yuan mark, falling to 6,620 yuan. However, due to the softening exchange market, banking groups Mingfeng and other banking groups took advantage of the low prices, suddenly generating buying interest, and it was pulled up by 40-50 yuan, reaching as high as 6,660 yuan. Unfortunately, securities firm Dafeng and gold firm Taikangcheng soon stirred up selling, and under heavy pressure, it fell to a low price of 6,618 yuan. Later, with purchases from Xinyuan and exchange banking groups, the trend was still upward. When the news of a shrinking US dollar rate arrived, the closing price returned to 6,650 yuan, with no honor or disgrace compared to the pre-holiday close. In the afternoon, the industry temporarily decided to close the market early, with a fluctuation of 102 yuan in half a day. The selling price of cash shops was more than 4 yuan higher than the price of burned remnants, and the purchase price was 40 yuan lower than the selling price. The current standard gold was quoted 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold, with little trading open.

Gold Jewelry Prices in Gold Shops Unchanged

The exchange price for gold jewelry in gold shops remained unchanged, with Datong Heng quoting 680 yuan, and new firms quoting similar prices, with a purchase price 30 yuan lower, it is said.

### Foreign Currency Increased Slightly

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the price of burned remnants return to flat after rising. British and American gold pounds finally stabilized. British currency was in very little demand, and the market price was slightly weak. US dollar notes initially traded at 18.27 yuan, then slightly retreated to 0.21 yuan, and peaked at 0.10 yuan at noon, finally reaching 18.32 yuan, which was 0.12 yuan higher compared to the holiday before the 23rd. Hong Kong notes slightly increased by one fen following the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. Demand for Japanese and Korean notes was significant, with the former reaching 1.58 yuan and the latter rising to 1.21 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn - US Cotton Falls, Local Cotton Quiet

New York cotton market initially rose due to buying from industry peers, then fell due to long positions closing and weakness in Wall Street stocks. The closing price was about eleven pound tones lower than the closing price. Indian cotton was halted. Yesterday's forecast, compared with the day before the market ended, predicted a high increase of about 5.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading was calm. As it was the beginning of the New Year, old customs had not been fully removed, and all parties were busy welcoming the God of Wealth and inviting opening market liquor, etc. Therefore, buying was not strong, and the market was quiet. As for the firm footing of raw cotton and the bullish market outlook, the trend will rise, and the market is just beginning.

### Economic Industry Talk

— Feng Liutang

Charcoal (1)

Charcoal is the leftover ash of firewood, that is, the unburned carbonaceous material. Before coal became prevalent, charcoal was used for warmth in winter, cooking, and industrial forging.

The discovery of charcoal was earliest. It is known that there was cooked food, firewood has been used, charcoal is a natural result of burning firewood. Charcoal made by specially burning wood in a kiln, that is, the commonly known charcoal. After burning procedures, a large production, for the public needs, it became a commodity.

Chinese people have used charcoal since ancient times. As stated in the Shangshu "the people fall into the mud and charcoal", (see Zhong Hui's Gaogao), mud metaphorically represents water, and charcoal metaphorically represents fire, which also means "the people fall into the midst of fire and water," indicating that the application of charcoal is very ancient. As for burning firewood into charcoal, there are also texts that can be found between the Zhou and Qin dynasties, such as the "Book of Rites - Monthly Orders," "When grasses and trees turn yellow and fall, then cut firewood for charcoal," which can be known.

Charcoal is made from firewood, so the place of production is not limited to one corner, but it must be mountainous villages rich in wood that can make charcoal. The charcoal used in the Jiangzhe area mostly comes from the Wintai area because the area is mostly mountainous and there is no fear of a shortage of firewood.

The mountains in the north are bare, so no charcoal is produced and coal is mostly used. Coal is coal because it comes out of the mines, as hard as stone, as black as charcoal. As mentioned in the "Book of the Former Han Dynasty - Geography", "Yuzhang County produces stone that can be burned as firewood", which is the type of coal. Sichuan produces a lot of bamboo, so it is also used to burn bamboo into charcoal, called bamboo charcoal. Song Lu You's "Lao Xue An Notes" has a cloud:

"The north has more coal, the south has more charcoal, and Shu also has bamboo charcoal, burning giant bamboo for it, easy to burn, smokeless, fire-resistant, also a strange thing. The iron produced in Qiongzhou is more beneficial for cooking and refining with bamboo charcoal, and the charcoal is all carried by ox carts."

As for burned charcoal, it mostly comes from the remnants of cooking stoves, placed in a cake urn, with a lid on top, or sealed with wet paper, to prevent air circulation, which becomes charcoal. The original name is floating charcoal, which means that it floats when thrown into water. In fact, 烰浮 and 浮 have the same ancient sound. In Bai Letian's poem, "Dusk half stove bran charcoal fire", written as "bran", later generations still mostly used 烰字. Lao Xue An notes, "In a handwritten manuscript of Chen Wu, there are more than ten articles, all entrusted to the liquor affairs official to buy floating charcoal, its poverty can be known". It can be seen that Song people still valued it as floating charcoal. It also said that "its poverty can be known", which is enough to show that floating charcoal is cheaper than other charcoal, which is also because the heating power of burned charcoal is weaker. However, burned charcoal is easy to start a fire, and coal is always used to attract it easily because its quality is looser than other charcoal

I have heard that the ancients had the elegant interest of gathering around a stove to talk and drink. At that time, there were no modern coal stove water Ting equipment, (now except for a few cities and a few families in the cities, most still use charcoal for heating), so well-to-do families often gathered around the stove for warmth, which could cook wine, make tea, and talk heart to heart, all in one fell swoop. Why must the stove be called a group? Because the surrounder describes its roundness. The round stove is set in the middle, and people around can sit around, so the stove is also named Weilu. Later, because the stove was not elegant, a large copper basin was used, and a round wooden base carved with flowers and painted with golden vermilion lacquer was used as a seat. Strips of charcoal were burned in it, and the fire was blazing, filling the room with spring. Some people threw spices and red dates into the charcoal to kill the strong smell. It is also known as a brazier. As recorded in the Dream of Red Mansions, when Jia's family performed ceremonies on New Year's Eve, in Yun's room, the ground was covered with red felt, and an elephant tripod with three legs of mud enamel fire basin was placed on the ground. Also, in Jia's mother's main room, burning pine and cypress incense and lily grass in the brazier, I want to see the gorgeous and rich atmosphere. (To be continued)

Foreign rice poured into Shanghai vigorously during the Spring Festival.

The above, except for the transfer to Qingdao, totals 57,865 bags, plus those reported the day before, totaling 200,855 bags. There are also two foreign wheels shipping from Saigon with an uncertain number. It is expected that reports will be made at any time.

### Sugar Market: Total Inventory of Foreign Sugar

Tai Gu Wheel Arrives with 13,400 Bags

It is checked that the city's sugar inventory as of the closing is only more than 2,000 bags of Qing and Dongxiang red South Sea red in national sugar, and 121,476 bags in total of foreign sugar such as rough wheels and other systems. The storage quantity is detailed as follows

There is a large amount of Dutch sugar to Shanghai, and the Tai Gu wheel sugar is not a small ammount coming to Shanghai. The Jinan Wheel arrived in Shanghai on the 28th, carrying 13,400 bags of wheeled sugar from Hong Kong. The Haikou Wheel also carried 500 bags of granulated sugar from Hong Kong.

### Miscellaneous: New Year Goods are Expensive - Influenced by "Control"

Last year, everything was expensive. Measured in legal tender, the expenses for one year were five or six times more than in previous years. However, the life still lived is extremely hard, mostly affected by "control" and "blockade". Prices are historically expensive, just talking about fruits, a small olive cost from five or six cents to two jiao, the tangerines sold by vendors all come from Nagasaki, Taiwan and other places, their color is orange-yellow, and their taste is bitter and sour. Shantou Mandarin oranges in China were rare and expensive due to the Japanese blockade, selling for 1.23 yuan per pound, and large ones sold for 56 jiao apiece. Sugarcane is best produced in Guang, but it is also obstructed by transportation and no goods have arrived. The sugarcane sold on the market is Zhehang Tangqi sugarcane, which used to sell for two jiao, and now sells for 78 jiao. The long-rooted sugarcane produced in Hangzhou sells for 1.56 yuan per root. The source of the "Yuanbao fish" on the fourth day of the new year is also subject to "control", and the price of those transported into the concession is very expensive. It was half the price of Qing fish in previous years, but now it is similar to Qing fish, from 1.56 yuan to 2.34 yuan per catty. A carp of more than one catty sells for 1.45 yuan, and some sell for 2 yuan.

### Welcoming the God of Wealth

— Xu Daming

Last night was the day when most shops ate "Wealth God Wine," and today is said to be "Wealth God Day." So all the big and small stores are "opening with great luck."

However, there are now two ways to welcome the God of Wealth: one is to use pig's head, three animals, incense and candles, and ingots to respectfully worship the gods and spirits to "welcome the God of Wealth"; the other is to use modern scientific weapons - Blanc Lin, to "welcome the God of Wealth." In fact, as a joke, it is an undeniable fact that we should not be bound by the god-ghost fatalism today, so if it is a bit "realistic," the second method is more direct and quick.

But this is by no means to say that I am encouraging everyone to welcome the "living" God of Wealth and deliberately disrupting social order. This is a deliberately misunderstood statement, but it must be pointed out that welcoming the "dead" God of Wealth is a "trick" of eating "hollow glutinous rice balls." You think, even if you imagine it out of thin air, and according to legend that there are five Wealth Gods, then there are too many people who are welcoming them. Those "clay sculptures and wood carvings," the "Wealth Gods" in people's imagination, really have the suffering of "not being able to cope with it all," but because they "can't make a sound," everyone can't hear it. However, we must explain that welcoming the dead God of Wealth also has a "realistic" side - the meat shop, candle shop…and other southern shops, have already received a large "Wealth God business." This is probably also called the "flanking" defense of those who know "military strategy" quite well. But the ones who suffer are still those friends who eat "hollow glutinous rice balls"!

So, I say, today, we should still seek "substance" a little bit. Superstition and fantasy must be "seen off" in our hands, but we must pay attention that "substance" must also have conditions - who is right and who is wrong!

### Shanghai Daycare Center Established - A Blessing for Working Women

— Anmin

Many people who oppose women's employment always use the child issue as a magic weapon for argument. What a "future master" the child is, and that women who take jobs will inevitably neglect the child—that is, disregard the "future master." This charge is really not small. Therefore, it has become a matter of course for women to return to the family.

But in fact, it is not entirely true. The "child problem" can be solved, and there is no shortage of precedents in other countries. That is to organize daycare centers.

Now the Shanghai YWCA has organized a Shanghai Daycare Center. The address is at 37B Breen Road, Tongren Hospital. Registration starts today at the YWCA at 323 Muirhead Road. As early as last July, they organized a preparatory committee and hired specialized personnel to serve as members. Detailed plans were considered, and now the merit is fulfilled. It is truly a blessing for working women.

Daycare centers can not only solve the child-raising problems of working women, but also a happiness for children themselves. Because the nurses and nannies in the center have all received specialized training and have a basic knowledge of children's physiology and psychology. Secondly, children grow up in collective life, and the concept of the group will naturally be deeply imprinted on the young mind. Our future masters should be collectivists, not flowers in a greenhouse.

Because it is the first time to start, the number of places in the center is temporarily limited to 100. As for the admission qualifications are as follows:

1. Parents must have a job and the income cannot afford the appropriate education of children.

2. Must be examined by a doctor and have no diseases.

3. Pass the intelligence test.

4. Must be introduced by a group or individual, and fill out the registration form in detail.

5. Those with special circumstances and verified by investigation.

As for the age of children, it is tentatively set from newborn to three years old. The length of stay is temporarily set for one year. After redoing the procedures, it can be continued. (Contact the YWCA for a prospectus for details.)

But everything is difficult at the beginning, so the YWCA authorities sincerely hope for the sponsorship and cooperation of people from all walks of life. Now they need the following items:

Cloth, towels, toys, furniture, potty, baby bottles, milk powder, soap, blankets, quilt, scales, medical supplies, etc.

People from all walks of life who wish to donate, please send to the Shanghai Daycare Center Office of the YWCA. Or notify the above address so that someone can be sent to collect. Enthusiastic people who wish to donate cash are also welcome. Donors take children as a unit, donating 20 yuan per person per month for living expenses, and 240 yuan per year.

Daycare centers are a social undertaking, and the joint efforts of the public can have a satisfactory harvest. Now is the so-called "Spring Festival" time, where can rich people not save a little money, if they can use it to benefit children and benefit society, it is truly immeasurable merit!

### Grand Hotel

— Qishui

Grand Hotel, quite a "decent" grand hotel, business is really lively, every room is full.

At least one table of mahjong in each room, two girls, right!

Uncle Zhao and Ma Xiaokai sat on the soft sofas, cigars in their hands, UB at their mouths, comfortably staring at rows of photos. On the square table next to them, mahjong tiles were spread all over, and Chairman Li and Wang Maiban were sitting on the mahjong tiles in a daze.

"Ma Xiaokai, this one's 'appearance is nothing'." Uncle Zhao finally opened his mouth with great emotion.

"Okay, pick another one, tell the room service 'just that old business with gold teeth.'" The two were like buying goods, picking the best and fattest to slaughter at will. Only then did they say, "Room service, room service!" The room service quickly responded and entered.

"Make a phone call, must have this one! Number three, number seven, hurry up!" Uncle Zhao's voice and expression were fierce.

As the room service scurried out like a mouse, a pot-bellied man came along the aisle, and the room suddenly stirred:

"Oh, Boss Zhang, please sit down, please sit down, …"

"They're all here, what a coincidence, what a coincidence." As soon as Boss Zhang sat down with a plop, Wang Maiban hurried to light a cigar and pour UB.

"Hey! Why aren't you guys playing mahjong?" Boss Zhang felt strange.

"Look, three short of one ah. Ma Xiaokai especially likes to call people, said mahjong should be played slowly." Uncle Zhao shouted, pleading as if wronged.

"Sit down, sit down, it's not a table.

"The mahjong tiles began to be active: "Whirring."

The room service scurried in again

"Sir," that's right, number three, number seven is here."

"Ha, quickly invite them to sit down, quickly invite them to sit down." The four people spoke in unison, with some eyes wide open. Some were squinting into a line.

The sound of oriole: "Little Zhang, you've been waiting for a long time."

"Come over! Number seven, accompany Boss Zhang to play mahjong!" Ma Xiaokai issued the order with absolute sanctity and seriousness, Boss Zhang was indeed a distinguished guest with "color" on the seat.

…Laughter filled the room.

"Eight rounds are over, let's settle the accounts. Atlantic Ocean to go." Boss Zhang pushed the tiles, sighed, and felt hungry.

"Well, it's still early, room service bring the theater program!"

"Right! The New Year's Day three-day program is really authentic, excellent." Only then did Ma Xiaokai push number three away from his side, and lazily began to open his mouth.

"Well, but, oranges must be bought in advance, too late…" The rat-headed Wang Maiban was the most refined, thinking of everything.

"Then make a phone call, and book a private room." Uncle Zhao showed his great power, easily spread his hands.

Zhang Xiaokai randomly pulled out fifty yuan for number three and number seven: "Accompany us to the theater again tonight."

"Thank you…" But tears rolled down his throat, and unknowingly a sneeze "Ah shoo!"

### Squeezing and Pushing

— Juehui

Everyone loves excitement. "The beginning of the year" brings a festive mood, so people try to squeeze through to the east and push to the west. If they can't squeeze, they push; if they can't push, they squeeze! If neither squeezing nor pushing works, they form a "long serpentine queue," which is also quite fun...

Because it's "once a year," people you don't usually see all come out; achievements you don't usually hear about also come out; in short, everyone comes out! So you squeeze me, I push you. The grand occasion is indeed unprecedented, but not without future occurrences!

January 28th, no! It's "the second day of the Lunar New Year." Amusement parks and movie theaters are packed to the brim. People refuse to leave if they can't buy tickets; anyway, squeezing and pushing, looking and seeing, is considered "worth the trip."

The sound of gunfire is not heard, and the smell of sulfur is not detected. Taking advantage of tonight, seeking pleasure, everyone squeezes, everyone pushes!

But you also have to be careful not to get pushed into the Huangpu River, because you can't be "pushed" down from there! Isn't that right?

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

"Things must rot from within before worms can bore into them!" He seemed to hear Shaowen's voice echoing in his ears: "Because you opera singers often mix with women from good families, people will treat you as playthings! As long as you keep yourself pure, not to mention a garrison commander, even the president or the grand marshal wouldn't dare to look down on you!"

Therefore, Begonia always focused intently on his performance on stage. Even though he knew that many beautiful women were sending electric glances to tempt him, he dared not return their gaze.

But the Wang family's daughter-in-law was truly special among many women. She was not only willing to spend time but also willing to spend money. At the Guangdelou, a ticket seller, bribed generously by her, sent several sets of costumes backstage. Although Begonia did not accept them, she had spent at least several hundred dollars! Afterward, Begonia's home continuously received many generous gifts from an anonymous person, clearly the woman's painstaking effort. Unfortunately, Begonia's will was not as easily overturned as that of ordinary young men. At the same time, Yuan Shaowen, as a good friend, constantly urged him, so he never did anything wrong.

Probably only later did she discover that Rongkui was the closest person to Begonia. To achieve her goal, this person was the best helper. Therefore, she sent her most trusted old nanny to represent her to suffer Yuan Shaowen's scolding on Rongkui's behalf. When she returned to the First House, she bumped into this "fake matchmaker," who was three or four times older than the "real Hongniang," outside the backstage door. Before he could speak, she routinely handed him a red paper packet, round and hard. The moment Rongkui touched it, he immediately knew that another ten dollars had come his way.

Money is the most precious treasure in the world; it can make people die or live, let alone these small errands? And Rongkui's conscience wasn't really bad. He felt that if he took someone's money, he should do something for them. Anyway, the Wang family's daughter-in-law wasn't some venomous snake or beast. Would Begonia be swallowed up if he met her?

"Okay, leave a number, and I'll call you if I get a chance!" As soon as Rongkui thought this, he became even bolder, as if this was something he should do. (18)

### After Watching La Fayette's "Home"

— Shi Wei

"Home," "Spring," and "Autumn," this continuous trilogy, can be said to be representative of Ba Jin's creations. When I saw "Home," although I didn't grow up in a large family or under a feudal system, I still finished reading it with tears, moved by the faithful and touching depiction of the collapse under the crushing wheels of the new era.

It is undeniable that Ba Jin is a writer who has always stood at the forefront of the times. He has a vast audience, and his creations are widely spread in every different class and corner. We know that when he started writing "Home," Juexin, surrounded by enemies, was forced to die under the heavy feudal evils. But when writing "Autumn," Guangzhou was writing in an air-raid shelter under the threat of bombs. Young people in the great era should no longer be cowardly. So we can see in "Autumn": Juexin, surrounded by thorns, is still living stubbornly. He destroys the outline of the "Home" and changes the proposed surrender. In the torrent of the times, that is the dross.

Because the background of "Home" is a large family full of feudal remnants, the situation hidden inside, the floating of people, is very complicated. When I heard that the Shanghai Drama Society had adapted "Home" into a play for performance, I felt immense joy. But I couldn't help but have some doubts. If this "Home," with hundreds of thousands of words and complex characters, were to be performed compactly and clearly in just three hours, I was a little worried that the original essence would be lost. However, unexpectedly, at the La Fayette Theater, after seeing "Home" under Wu Tian's moving adaptation, I felt immense satisfaction.

The curtain opens at the Gao mansion, during the New Year's Eve family reunion. The Gao patriarch, with four generations under one roof, discovers that Juehui is not there. Although the school has already started winter vacation, he is still busy with meetings and running the weekly newspaper. So a group of stubborn conservatives, especially Grandpa's friend Feng Leshan as the central pillar, and the Keming and Ke'an faction, sigh greatly. Isn't that a Western school, studying Western things? Although their own decadent private lives are all worthy of criticism. But the younger generation, especially Juehui, who have been baptized by modern culture, he curses the large family with feudal remnants. He loves his eldest brother Juexin, but even hates him, he is too cowardly and unresisting, enduring everything. When his two brothers have any outrageous (?) actions, Grandpa only asks Juexin. You and I are young people, we must drag our own happiness back, one-sided endurance, you killed cousin Mei, and killed the elder sister-in-law, not enough? Let the eldest brother come to endure, do you want to repeat this tragedy on Juemin again? So we ourselves, must solve the problems. Juemin starts to flee the marriage, "You are a believer of evil forces." Juehui can no longer stay in this murky and shadowy family for even a minute, for his own longing future, he resolutely abandons his beloved brothers, although each of them loves deeply, their thoughts however form a significant divide in their era, Juehui finally leaves

The story is familiar to us, the script is faithful to the original work, and the director's technique is very close and detailed, especially the characterization. Like Keding's unwitting confession in front of Grandpa, smoking opium, and owing debts, his oily and sniffling demeanor; when the Gao patriarch asks Feng Leshan how the fireworks are, he stares unblinkingly at the head of the Wufeng, uttering double entendres, which is very clever.

The actor Xu Li's Juexin is the most vivid, on the one hand, he is subject to the high pressure of feudal remnants, on the other hand, the newborn force directly confronts him, he is full of painful contradictions. Yingzi plays Mingfeng's loneliness, Lan Lan plays cousin Mei's poignant and moving, two unfortunate people but respectively perform absolutely different effects. Yan Jun makes an entrance with a humorous posture, his close-up of a clown, in the tragic atmosphere, precisely achieves a degree of adjustment. Other Xia Xia, Han Fei, Hu Dao, and Dai Yun are all very competent. The setting is also pleasing.

Perhaps I am full of emotions. After watching "Home," I shed my cheap tears. On the way home, I repeatedly thought of a sentence said by Juexin: "We are young people, we cannot be slaves forever, we must chase our own happiness back."

To the esteemed editor,

I recently read an article in your publication on the 21st, introducing the news of "Floating Clouds and Flowing Water," which stated that, in addition to our school's drama club, Fudan students have recently organized a "Yunhai Drama Club" led by Huang Jiaxiang...etc. After investigation, our club members, in addition to dedicating themselves to the club's affairs, have no spare energy to engage in extracurricular activities, and Mr. Huang Jiaxiang is not a member of the Water Club. I should state the above.

### Walt Disney's New Work "Fantasia" Premieres in New York Stokowski Composes the Music for This Film The Greatest Musical Cartoon Film

— Xia Sha

The creator of "Snow White" and "Pinocchio" recently had another collection of musical cartoons, including eight short films, all accompanied by classical music, the general name of the film is "Fantasia." Moreover, the protagonists in the cartoons are all new types, only one short film uses Mickey Mouse.

"Fantasia" has been having a "world premiere" in a Broadway theater in New York since mid-January. Because the cartoon collection is both educational and musical, it can be effective in all aspects. Among the guests were photographers, musicians, colorful artists, technical experts, movie stars, stage stars, journalists, famous drama critics, and thousands of spectators from all walks of life, most of whom were music lovers and innocent children.

Walt Disney put all his efforts into it, so the dubbing, characters, and colors of the cartoon collection are more advanced than any of his previous works. Half of the box office revenue on the premiere day was allocated to the British war relief fund. After each short film was screened, it was followed by continuous applause and cheers. The eight short films lasted two hours and forty-five minutes, but the beauty of the music attracted them, which was truly unprecedented.

Finally, it should be mentioned that the great musician Stokowski, Garbo's lover, is the composer of the interludes for Walt Disney's film. He said that he wanted the audience to vividly see the artistic images of the cartoons and appreciate its moving and pleasant sounds. He said that he wanted to give the audience the feeling of hearing the sound of the spring flowing beside the mountains, hearing the songs of the shepherd boys, hearing the gentle sound of the wind, hearing the songs of the birds; and Leder Disney's "Fantasia" did achieve this, it is a great musical cartoon film.

### Hollywood's New Prophecy

— Qing Hui

Hollywood astrologer Motisse always makes a surprising prophecy at the beginning of each year. His predictions last year, which were published in this column, such as a young student becoming extremely popular, Ke Fulanxi's box office plummet, and the emotional breakdown of Taylor Bauer and his wife, were all accurate. This year's prophecy is divided into two parts, which were published in the New York Weekly Mirror in succession, and now a translated excerpt is as follows, waiting for the facts to prove it.

### Development of the Film Industry

1941 will occupy an important position in film history, with less profit perhaps being enough to create better results, while also providing movie fans with better tastes.

In 1941, there will be a batch of new talents on the screen. Many famous film actors retire, which is the day for a group of newcomers to show their talents. This group of people will slowly gain support.

The criticism from movie fans should be more intelligent and sharp, they first want a good story, and this requirement has a great effect on the film industry.

American patriotic films will rise in time, and A-level films and B-level films will no longer be distinguished.

Overseas market box office decreases, but this can make the film company's internal affairs more concentrated.

Word of mouth from movie fans is far more effective than publicity, they see a good story, and will inevitably promote it to friends, which is enough to improve the filmmaker's selection of stories.

Glamour will not be important, and male and female actors who focus on performance will have more opportunities to perform, and what movie fans are most fascinated and interested in is their performance ability.

Will take more themes from South America and Australia.
