### Chongqing Transportation Sector Firmly Claims: Chinese Troops Have Already Recaptured Yichang; Japanese Transportation Line on the Hanyi Road Has Been Intercepted; Counter-attacking Chinese Troops Have Pressed Close to the Suburbs of Zhengzhou

Chongqing - The true situation in the Yichang area remains unclear today. The Japanese side claims to have repelled the Chinese troops, while transportation circles firmly maintain that they received an urgent message from the front lines stating that Yichang has already been recaptured. The Chinese Military Commission stated that it will make no announcement regarding the fate of Yichang until it obtains detailed and accurate information. (United Press, 8th)

Chongqing - This afternoon, some local residents set off firecrackers to celebrate the news of the recapture of Yichang, which has not yet been officially confirmed. It is said that the official announcement to be released at midnight tonight is unlikely to contain formal confirmation. According to the information currently received, Chinese troops have entered the city, but fierce fighting for various military strongholds around Yichang is still ongoing. The outcome of the battle will largely depend on this. At the same time, it is reported that Chinese troops have launched an offensive in the Hanshui River area, under the command of General Li Zongren. According to unconfirmed reports, Chinese troops have recaptured Shashi. (Reuters, 8th) Battlefield in Yichang - Various units supporting the Xiangbei operation from western Hubei, northern Hubei, and southern Henan are advancing rapidly. After achieving their objectives, they recaptured the strongholds near the suburbs, including Dongshan Temple, Ciyun Temple, Chadianzi, Yangchalu Town, and Jingshan, on the 8th. Other key locations are surrounded by Chinese forces. The Japanese transportation on the Pinghan, Yuehan, and Hanyi roads has been gradually disrupted by the Chinese forces, causing considerable panic among the Japanese troops. (Dispatch, 8th)

Chongqing - Military news: After the Japanese forces in the Yichang area were subjected to continuous fierce attacks by the Chinese troops, they faced the immediate danger of complete collapse. According to Chinese sources, Chinese troops recaptured four key military strongholds outside Yichang, leaving the Japanese troops inside Yichang with no defenses. It is also said that the Japanese troops in the city have been setting fires continuously in recent days, apparently preparing for a general retreat. It is further stated that the recapture of Yichang by Chinese troops is imminent. (Associated Press, 8th)

Chongqing - Tonight's official announcement here did not mention Yichang, but stated that resistance in the Rongze and Zhongmu areas is continuing. Observers believe that Chinese troops are launching offensives in Yichang and other positions to coordinate with Changsha. Rumors of street fighting in Yichang are very likely. After the Japanese troops attacked Zhengzhou, they may continue to attack other locations or even launch a pincer attack on Tongguan, heading directly towards Luoyang from Yangcheng. However, elite Chinese troops have gathered in Tongguan and Xinyang, waiting for the arrival of the Japanese troops. If the Japanese troops attack west from Zhengzhou, they will be severely struck by the Chinese forces. (Associated Press, 8th)

Chongqing - It is reported that Chinese troops are attacking Japanese-occupied Yichang, but today's official war bulletin did not mention the fighting around Yichang. Chinese troops in Zhongmu, Rongze, and the suburbs of Zhengzhou continue to resist. Observers believe that the Chinese offensive on the Yichang and other fronts was launched simultaneously with the counter-offensive in Changsha. Street fighting is believed to have occurred in Yichang. It is believed here that the Japanese attack on Zhengzhou may be a prelude to a larger offensive elsewhere, or they may launch a large-scale offensive from Tongguan and Xinyang to converge on Luoyang. However, strong Chinese forces have been concentrated on the Tongguan and Xinyang fronts to defend them. Chinese troops have firmly established themselves in the mountainous areas of Huaxian on the eastern section of the coastal railway, waiting for the Japanese troops to advance westward. (Associated Press, 8th)

Chongqing - Last night, it was widely rumored here that Chinese troops had entered Yichang and were engaged in street fighting with the Japanese troops. Although the authorities have not verified this information, it has aroused high hopes among the Chinese community here. According to observers, this is very likely, but it is also stated that whether this move will have strategic effects is another matter entirely. Since the fierce battle in Changsha on September 27, Chinese troops have been engaged in offensives in areas such as Yichang. The authorities have only stated that they have recaptured a number of strongholds and inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese troops, without publishing details. This is because these battles are only local engagements, aimed at containing the Japanese troops. For the sake of prudence, they do not want to create other impressions among the people. However, last night, it was suddenly rumored that Chinese troops had entered Yichang, and the authorities remained silent, which many believe is because the battle is still developing or because they do not want to announce anything before victory is assured. The fighting in the Zhengzhou area is still ongoing, but the situation has not changed. (Reuters, 8th)

Chongqing - While the battle in northern Hunan was at its most intense, Chinese troops in western Hubei launched an offensive against Yichang, making very smooth progress. However, the authorities are unwilling to release any battle reports before obtaining concrete results. The only exception is the dispatch from this city released by the Central News Agency the night before last, which briefly stated that Chinese troops attacked Yichang on the 27th of last month, recapturing key points and inflicting heavy casualties. The purpose of this move was originally to support northern Hunan, and now that the Japanese troops in northern Hunan have been defeated and retreated, it can be said that the objective has been achieved. The release of this news must have a certain purpose. Secondly, there was the bombing of Yichang by the Chinese Air Force on the 1st of this month, as well as today's news from Enshi, which stated that Chinese troops in Dongshan City shot down a Japanese plane. Dongshan City is only four kilometers from Yichang. Based on this, the extent of the Chinese troops' advance can be imagined. Furthermore, it has been learned from well-informed sources that Chinese troops have occupied more than seventy large and small points in the periphery of Yichang since the offensive began. Since yesterday, they have been fighting in the suburbs of Yichang, and now it has evolved into street fighting. According to a reliable source, Zhongshan Park in the suburbs of Yichang was indeed occupied on the Mid-Autumn Festival night. This statement further confirms the news of the suburban and street fighting. In short, there are various indications that the complete recapture of Yichang should be imminent. (Havas, 7th)

### Sao Dang Bao Editorial Welcomes the U.S. Military Mission: China Needs Modern Weapons and Technology; Assistance Must Be Massive and Rapid

Chongqing - The Sao Dang Bao published an editorial this morning welcoming the U.S. military mission, stating that while China's reserves of manpower and material resources are virtually inexhaustible, it urgently needs modern equipment and technical assistance. How can the democratic countries effectively meet China's needs? It depends on the quantity and quality of their material assistance and on the rapid delivery of such assistance to China. After four years of hard fighting, Japan no longer has the ability to wage war against the United States. This can be seen from the panic caused to Japan by the imposition of sanctions by Britain and the United States after Japan entered southern Vietnam. It is now time for the democratic countries to tighten the shackles on Japanese militarism. The newspaper also stated that the mission was originally scheduled to arrive in Chongqing yesterday, but has not yet arrived. (Reuters, 8th)

It is reported that the medal was delivered to this city yesterday and handed over to Vice Commander Li. (Dispatch, 7th)

### U.S. Military Mission Arrives in China

Following the meeting of Far Eastern dignitaries of the British Empire in Singapore and the meeting of British and American military leaders in Manila, the attention of all parties in the Far East has once again focused on Hong Kong in recent days. This week, important figures from China, Britain, and the United States have successively arrived in the city, including Assistant Secretary of State 格拉第 (Grady), sent by the U.S. President to investigate financial and economic conditions in the Far East; 美委員福克斯 (Fox), a member of the Equalization Fund; British Ambassador to China 寇爾 (Kerr); a British financial and economic delegation headed by 聶梅雅 (Niemeyer); and U.S. financial expert 高克蘭 (Cochran), all of whom are about to arrive in Hong Kong to participate in the upcoming trilateral economic conference. What is attracting attention both domestically and abroad is the U.S. military mission to China, which, under the leadership of Colonel 马格鲁特 (Magruder), has flown to Hong Kong after the conclusion of the military conference in the Philippines and is about to proceed to China's wartime capital to begin its major task assigned by the U.S. President. The arrival of the aforementioned figures in Hong Kong, although different in nature and mission, is inextricably linked to the Far Eastern resistance to violence and is an important part of the international anti-aggression war.

Since the end of the last major war, the isolationist faction in the United States has gained the upper hand, and the people have all regarded war as something to be feared. As a result, the United States has not had any military involvement with any other country for the past twenty years. Even when France was defeated last summer, French Prime Minister 莱诺 (Reynaud) sent repeated telegrams to the United States for help, but President Roosevelt, under heavy constraints, could only offer verbal encouragement, which ultimately did nothing to prevent France's collapse. The dispatch of this military mission to China is not only a formal dispatch by the U.S. government, but also gives it extremely broad powers. Although its mission arises from the Lend-Lease Act, it is not limited by the Lend-Lease Act. Thus, even though the United States is still avoiding participation in the war, from another perspective, the dispatch of such a military mission may be a means of avoiding direct involvement in the vortex of war. However, the United States is no longer shying away from its responsibility for the anti-aggression war and is beginning to adopt more active measures beyond economic sanctions and the lending of war materials to assist countries fighting a just war. This is another major step forward in the U.S. anti-aggression measures. The military conference in Manila discussed how to expedite the delivery of war materials to China, and 马格鲁特 (Magruder)'s remarks in Hong Kong also stated that they would do their utmost to assist China in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act. However, the mission of the delegation is clearly not limited to implementing the Lend-Lease Act. The methods of utilizing U.S. military supplies in China, how to improve the Chinese military's operational strategy and tactics, the intensified preparations for a general counter-offensive in the future, and even the training of new troops and mechanized units are all likely to be within the delegation's purview. According to President Roosevelt's explanation of the mission on September 26, the fourth item: "To submit recommendations of an appropriate nature to ensure that assistance to China under the Lend-Lease Act is as efficient as possible, to the benefit of the efforts of the United States, China, and the world to resist military conquest" has a very broad connotation. All of the above are exactly what the delegation should strive to accomplish in order to implement that provision.

Recently, the Chinese army won a major victory in northern Hunan, and there has been news of the capture of Yichang in western Hubei. In northern Henan, although the Japanese army has made some progress, the Chinese army's tenacious resistance is also recognized by the world. 马格鲁特 (Magruder) and his party are coming to China at this juncture, and the experience of these decisive battles will undoubtedly provide the delegation with very valuable reference materials. Specifically: The Chinese army's bravery and resilience, which has been consistent for four years, has been further demonstrated by the recent battles. In terms of military strength, China has inexhaustible human resources, but its weapons are backward and its equipment is insufficient. Therefore, it has to be selective about the terrain for combat, and the strategy of exchanging time for space has not yet become a thing of the past. As a result, the launch of a general counter-offensive cannot but be delayed. However, the current international situation is changing rapidly, and opportunities must not be missed, and time should not be delayed. How to enable the Chinese army to obtain the equipment and arms it urgently needs, so as to launch an effective counter-offensive across the board with thunderous force, and to promote the restoration of order in the Far East, is the most pressing task for 马格鲁特 (Magruder) and his party after arriving in China.

After the British and American military conference in the Philippines was held, Japanese public opinion expressed extreme impatience, and even openly made threatening remarks, which further clouded the relationship between Britain and the United States and Japan, which was already as opposite as the poles. As for the intermittent talks between the United States and Japan, although there have been meetings between 野村 (Nomura) and 赫尔 (Hull) and the visit of the 若杉 (Wakusugi) and other Japanese delegations to the United States, recent developments have widened the distance between the United States and Japan. It is absolutely not something that diplomatic contact can reverse. Therefore, even if the talks between the two sides are still continuing, or the U.S. and Japanese authorities are still hoping for peace and compromise, those dull talks have no meaning other than to delay the situation. On the other hand, the recent arrival of U.S. economic and military envoys in China in succession, and the holding of the military conference in the Philippines, further illustrate that the U.S. authorities' true intention is to strengthen China's economic and military strength and to enhance military cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East, so as to curb the spread of violence in the Far East. As for the future of the U.S.-Japan talks, whether they are held or discontinued, it is no longer a matter of great importance.

### Important Meeting Held at White House to Discuss Revising Neutrality Act to Allow Armed Merchant Ships to Sail in War Zones; Roosevelt Prepares Message to Congress

Washington, Aug. 8 (United Press) - Reliable sources say President Roosevelt told a meeting of congressional leaders from both parties that he wanted to eliminate two provisions in the current Neutrality Act that prohibit armed U.S. merchant ships and U.S. ships from entering combat zones. President Roosevelt postponed the meeting until today, and it is widely believed that a definitive procedure will be adopted by then. Kentucky Democratic Senator 白一克莱 (Barkley) said that undoubtedly, President Roosevelt will send a simple message to Congress once he has obtained preliminary explanations. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State 赫尔 (Hull) met at the White House with congressional leaders of their choosing to decide how to present the plan to Congress to amend the Neutrality Act. Many possibilities exist, and the following steps are widely believed to be taken: (1) Allow armed merchant ships, followed by a request to allow U.S. ships to enter combat zones; (2) Implement the above two actions simultaneously; (3) Completely repeal the Neutrality Act; (4) The government revokes President Roosevelt's previous declaration that Britain is in a state of belligerency, and U.S. ships can now enter the ports of belligerent countries. Congressional leaders are believed to have told President Roosevelt that the proposal to arm merchant ships is expected to pass both houses. Some believe that the request to completely repeal the Neutrality Act can be passed in the Senate, but doubt whether the House of Representatives will pass it.

Washington, Aug. 8 (Reuters) - Reliable sources say President Roosevelt has told congressional leaders that he favors amending the Neutrality Act to allow merchant ships to be armed and to enter belligerent ports and war zones. According to those who participated in yesterday's White House meeting, the president consulted with congressional leaders for two and a half hours. It has not yet been decided whether the president will ask Congress to approve the above two changes in a message to Congress, or whether he will first ask for permission to arm merchant ships and then propose a proposal allowing merchant ships to sail as they please. According to a participant, there was unanimous agreement that both methods should be adopted, but there was some debate about the procedures to be followed. Lend-Lease Coordinator 霍浦金 (Hopkins) strongly advocated for the immediate implementation of both methods. Senator 巴克萊 (Barkley) told reporters that the president would send a message to Congress as soon as all issues had been discussed thoroughly. It is expected that the White House will continue to meet today and make a firm decision.

Panama's Ban on Armed Merchant Ships Increases the Need to Amend the Neutrality Act

Washington, Aug. 8 (Reuters) - When President Roosevelt was asked by reporters yesterday to comment on Panama's decision to oppose armed merchant ships, he said he thought reporters should discuss the matter with Secretary of State 赫尔 (Hull), but that he believed Panama was only following current U.S. legal restrictions. One reporter said that the president had said when signing the original Neutrality Act that there might be a situation in the future where the act would have an impact that was completely different from its original intention, and that this flexible provision might eventually lead the United States to participate in the war. The reporter asked if the president still held this view. The president replied, "In part, yes," and added that the general state of the world and the United States' relationship to the state of the world had changed greatly since the Neutrality Act of 1936 and the amended Neutrality Act of 1939 were established. Another reporter asked, "Does the president mean that Panama's actions have increased the need for the United States to amend the Neutrality Act promptly?" The president replied that he thought so. The reporter then asked whether U.S. ships registered in Panama would re-register in other South American countries. The president replied that he had not considered this. The president's various responses above clearly show that he still advocates that Congress act immediately to lift the ban on arming U.S. ships.

Washington, Aug. 8 (Reuters) - Secretary of State 赫尔 (Hull) told reporters yesterday that the issue of arming merchant ships registered in Panama was a matter for the Panamanian government and the ship lessors. The State Department has not asked Panama to explain its decision. The arming of U.S. merchant ships registered in Panama is only one issue in the large problem of Western Hemisphere defense, which Panama and other American countries are currently working on together. When asked whether the United States could demand that merchant ships be armed by virtue of being the owner of ships such as the Pink Star, which had been sunk, 赫尔 (Hull) replied that the U.S. government could not have the final say on whether merchant ships flying the Panamanian flag could be armed. These ships have been leased to private parties. The U.S. government can, of course, issue orders to manage such incidents, but in the absence of such orders, the lessors can use their own discretion in making technical decisions. In the current situation, arming merchant ships is a completely normal thing. He has not heard of any government other than the United States banning the arming of merchant ships. When asked whether the Panamanian government had explained to the United States the reasons for the arming ban, 赫尔 (Hull) replied that he had not asked about it.

### The United States, Britain, and the Dutch East Indies: Not a Drop of Oil to Japan; The Eastern Daily News Observes Philippine Military Conference, Believing the U.S. and Britain are Intensifying the Encirclement of Japan

Reuters, London, August 8th - A Washington diplomatic source reports that since the freezing and embargo orders were issued, the U.S. has stopped all oil shipments to Japan. Reliable sources also state that Britain and the Netherlands have completely embargoed oil to Japan. Qualified observers believe Japan is facing an unavoidable choice between moderating its foreign policy or continuing its expansion, and this decision must be made soon. Japan's export commerce has completely halted due to the informal blockade by the U.S., Britain, and the Dutch East Indies. Trade with Latin America is also reportedly suspended.

Reuters, Tokyo, August 8th - The Asahi Shimbun reported today that Japan cannot ignore the recent British and American military conference held in Manila, as they have revealed preparations for a concentrated defense of the South Pacific to counter Japan and aid China. The Hochi Shimbun reported that the conference discussed British and American aid to China, implementing a joint Anglo-American military strategy in southwestern China, and methods for the U.S. to provide military assistance to both armies. The Hochi Shimbun expressed extreme skepticism about recent U.S.-Japan talks, believing that Britain and the U.S. are discussing a joint strategy to intensify the encirclement of Japan. The Kokumin Shimbun pointed out that the U.S.'s initial intentions in the U.S.-Japan talks were misunderstanding and a lack of understanding of Japan's position in the Far East. The newspaper also issued a warning, stating that Japan's patience is limited, and if the U.S. ignores this limit, the entire nation of Japan will rise up to attack. The Kokumin Shimbun further stated that while the progress of the negotiations is unclear, the people must be prepared for the U.S.'s arrogant and contemptuous attitude, and the government's primary duty is to promote the highest national spirit.

Reuters, Batavia, August 8th - Former Shanghai correspondent for the New York Times, Abend, who flew to Sydney two days ago, stated here that Japan will not attack the Dutch East Indies or Malaya without first taking action against the Philippines. The defense of the Philippines has been greatly strengthened. In addition to the strong U.S. air force and navy stationed there, there are currently 130,000 Filipinos undergoing military training.

### The Defense of Malaya Depends on the Navy; Training the Army to Resist Paratrooper Invasions

Reuters, Singapore, August 8th - British Malaya's General Officer Commanding, Major General Percival, announced today that the army is currently training soldiers to resist possible paratrooper invasions. He stated, "We will certainly not forget the lessons of Crete." When asked if the British are considering whether the U.S. and the Dutch East Indies will provide substantial assistance if Malaya is invaded, Major General Percival said, "We certainly hope that the U.S. and the Netherlands will assist us. The more assistance, the sooner the war will end." He declined to say whether Malaya could be defended without the assistance of the U.S. Navy, but acknowledged the lack of a strong navy in Malayan waters, hence the need to maintain a larger army defense. He also stated, "The defense of Malaya will be similar to Malta and Gibraltar, relying solely on the navy." When asked if he was satisfied with the current defenses of Malaya, he said, "This is a big question. From the perspective of the people of Singapore, there will never be a day of satisfaction." He reiterated at a press conference the necessity of mobilizing the military forces of Europe and Asia, both in volunteer and regular forces, believing that reinforcements from the British Empire and Australia greatly affect shipping, as it requires the transportation of large quantities of equipment and supplies. He also stated that the majority of food supplies come from Malaya, but said that the lack of shipping does not hinder the progress of defense. Furthermore, he mentioned that due to the shortage of workers in Malaya, there may be a need to conscript Chinese from Hong Kong. He added that he has convened an advisory committee on volunteer forces to review the issue of mobilizing new troops.

### U.S. Secretary of the Navy Proposes to the House of Representatives the Construction of 400 Small Warships; Observatories to be Established on Johnston Island and Other Places to Measure Wind Direction and Wind Force to Facilitate Patrol Flights

Havas Agency, Washington, August 7th - Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox has sent a letter to House Speaker Rayburn proposing the construction of 400 small warships to defend the U.S. coast.

Reuters, Washington, August 8th - The Department of Commerce announced yesterday that the U.S. Weather Bureau has completed preparations to establish a "balloon observatory" on Johnston Island and Palmyra Island to observe wind direction and force to aid aviation. Recall that Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox recently announced the establishment of seaplane bases on these islands and Samoa, "so that the Navy's giant seaplanes can patrol the vast area of the Pacific Ocean."

### The Soviet Union Mobilizes All Its Strength to Counter the New German Offensive; Fierce Fighting on the Moscow-Soviet Railway Line; Severe Cold and Snowfall in the Moscow Region

Reuters, London, August 8th - Moscow Radio broadcasted last night that as Hitler begins his massive offensive on Moscow, heavy snow is just beginning to fall around the Soviet capital.

Reuters, Moscow, August 8th - Soviet spokesman Lozovsky stated last night that the Soviet army has mobilized all its strength to meet the new challenge from the German army on the central front. When asked whether Hitler's announced new offensive was expected to begin or had already begun, Lozovsky replied that it was currently underway, and if the German side could sacrifice hundreds of thousands more soldiers to their deaths, they were welcome to do so. Hitler announced last Friday that he was prepared to attack. This offensive will apparently unfold on the central front. The reason why Hitler made this statement and the German side will make a desperate effort is that the swift success of the Tripartite Pact has allowed the enemy to give Germany a very large impression. The general German people have now fully realized that Britain and the Soviet Union have formed a powerful group, with the assistance of the United States, and know that although Germany has won victories, it has ultimately failed to defeat the U.S. and Britain. In order to reassure the people, the German side is spreading the promise of launching an offensive immediately after the Soviet side's losses and failures. A second reason is that Hitler wants to achieve a major victory before winter.

Reuters, London, August 8th - According to local sources, the German army, braving the fierce resistance of the Soviet army, has made slight progress in its advance on Moscow from the south. Soviet midnight bulletins reported fierce fighting in the Vyazma and Bryansk areas. Vyazma is a junction on the Smolensk-Moscow railway line, about 130 miles southwest of the Soviet capital. Bryansk is also a railway center, about 220 miles southwest of the Soviet capital. When the German army launched its offensive in the central region, it was repulsed here by the Soviet army under the command of Timoshenko. On the Ukrainian front, the German side claimed to have occupied two ports on the Sea of Azov, but this has not been confirmed. A German division on the Perekop Isthmus suffered heavy losses from Soviet naval artillery fire, and Romanian artillery units near Odessa were also forced to retreat by heavy Soviet naval bombardment. The Soviet side claimed that the Soviet army in Leningrad had achieved local victories, while the German army took a defensive posture. The Soviet announcement of fighting in the Vyazma and Bryansk areas was the first Soviet announcement of the new German offensive on Moscow. When Smolensk fell, the Soviet side admitted that the enemy must have broken through the city, but then claimed that the German army had been repulsed. This new German offensive seems to be based in this area.

Reuters, Moscow, August 8th - In the Leningrad area and in Crimea, the Soviet army is still holding firm. The German army has had to ease its pressure, and some of the German troops on the Leningrad front may have been transferred elsewhere to fight.

German Forces Launch Pincer Attack, Met with Strong Resistance from the Red Army

Reuters, Moscow, August 8th - Judging from the war situation on the front lines as reported in the "Red Star" newspaper, there must be very fierce fighting underway in the central part of the front. Since July, when the German army was stopped after launching a terrifying offensive straight at Moscow, this area has been relatively quiet. The Soviet army, well-equipped, has taken the initiative and one of its major achievements was to recover the Yenlya salient. Therefore, the German army may not attempt to attack Moscow directly again, but is now concentrating its forces to carry out a massive pincer movement. The "Red Star" newspaper described three war situations in which the Soviet army met the German army's recent attempt to attack the Soviet capital with strong resistance. It is reported that in one area, Commander Baurdin was ordered to lead his troops to attack a concentrated German force. Enemy aircraft repeatedly attacked the Soviet army, but were driven off by Baurdin's anti-aircraft artillery and Soviet fighter planes. A fierce battle ensued between the Soviet and German armies, with both sides using tanks, aircraft, and infantry. The fighting is ongoing. Baurdin's troops have broken through the German lines in one place, and have launched a counterattack, destroying 38 enemy tanks and shooting down 31 enemy aircraft. In another area, which is defended by the Soviet army under the command of the famous General Yushkevicius, the German army launched a large-scale attack, trying to find a weak point. The Soviet tank force led by Chunov destroyed 34 German tanks. The two armies are currently engaged in a desperate battle along the front in this area, and the gaps between the trees have changed hands repeatedly. In this area, a German tank company destroyed 19 Soviet tanks and 62 Soviet planes were destroyed by Soviet aircraft. In the third area, the German army first bombarded with artillery, then sent tanks to attack. The fighting was extremely fierce. The Soviet army first allowed the German tanks to enter the range of direct-fire artillery, and then bombarded them fiercely. Some German tanks broke through this artillery network and reached the Soviet positions, but were met by the Soviet army with incendiary liquid bottles. The infantry battle then unfolded and lasted all day. The enemy army suffered a heavy blow from the combined forces of the Soviet army and air force, losing 45 tanks, 100 other vehicles, and 800 enemy soldiers killed. This shows a glimpse of the intensity of the fighting in the central region.

German Claims of Victory in the South, War Reports Full of Contradictions

Reuters, Moscow, August 8th - A Reuters military correspondent reports that there are still no detailed reports on the large-scale German offensive mentioned by Hitler in his speech last Friday. In fact, it has not yet been officially confirmed. The German side claimed to have won a major victory north of the Sea of Azov, and that the German army is pursuing the defeated enemy, but the Soviet side also claimed to have won in that area, and that a German division was heavily damaged in Yenichesk on the Sea of Azov. The contradictions in the war reports are quite strange. In any case, the scale of the fighting in this area may not be as large as Hitler said. This is the extreme right wing of the German army and must be bombarded by Soviet ships. News about Leningrad is also quite contradictory. Unofficial sources in the Swedish capital said that the German General Leeb is currently making another desperate effort to capture the city, while the Soviet side reported that the Soviet garrison in the city had launched a successful counterattack and that the situation of the defenders had improved. On the other hand, it was also reported that the German offensive against the city had eased, and that part of the German forces under Leeb had been transferred to the central region to attack. With conflicting reports from all sides, it is difficult to assess the true situation, but it can be said that Leningrad, like Odessa, is still resolutely holding on. According to various evidence, the determination of the garrison has not diminished in the slightest. The German army may be applying pressure along the entire line to probe for weaknesses. This costly move will prove how much manpower and material resources Hitler can afford to waste in seeking a faint victory on the boundless Soviet plains.

### Finland Replies to the British Note, Participation in the War is Purely Self-Defense; Declares Its Aim is to Recover Lost Territory, Without Any Political Obligations

Reuters, London, August 8th - The British Foreign Office received last night Finland's reply to the recent British memorandum. This reply was forwarded by the Swedish Minister to Britain and is currently under consideration. (Note: On September 22, the British government, through the Norwegian Minister to Finland, warned Finland about its continued war against the Soviet Union, declaring that if it did not cease hostilities, Britain would consider Finland an enemy in wartime and in the post-war peace conference.)

Reuters, Berlin, August 8th - The German news agency, citing a report from its correspondent in Helsinki, stated that Finland, in its reply to the British memorandum of September 28, declared that Finland's war against the Soviet Union had always been of a defensive nature. It reviewed the unprovoked Soviet attack on Finland at the end of November 1939, the forced treaty by which Finland was compelled to cede territory to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet attitude towards Finland after Moscow. This Soviet attitude had the same purpose as the previous armed attack, namely, the destruction of Finland. On June 22 of this year, Soviet troops resumed hostile acts against Finland. On June 25, Soviet hostility turned into a systematic attack. Finland knew that the Soviet Union was again aiming at Finland for armed aggression, and only in early July did it begin to adopt a plan for active self-defense. Therefore, Finland's war has always been of a defensive nature. Important areas within the 1939 border are still in enemy territory. These areas, and the areas outside the border that the Finnish army has now captured, are the starting points from which the Soviet army attacks Finland. No one can deny Finland's right to self-defense, and effective self-defense lies in advancing its defensive line to the above-mentioned locations. This land is outside the eastern border and is not purely Russian land. Its residents are all Finns. Finland is now waging a war of self-defense, without political obligations. Fortunately, this is by no means a solitary war. Britain is a country with which Finland still wishes to maintain peaceful relations. It is incomprehensible to Finland that Britain now recognizes that it has reason to treat Finland as an open enemy simply because Finland is not fighting the Soviet Union alone.

Finland Replies to Norway, Willing to Preserve Old Friendship

Havas Agency, Helsinki, August 7th - According to an official announcement, on September 22, the day the British government presented a note to Finland, the Norwegian government in London also presented a similar note, stating that if the Finnish government continues to fight alongside the country that invaded Norway, it will hinder the current relations between the Finnish and Norwegian peoples. The Finnish government presented a reply today, stating briefly that cooperation among the peoples of the Scandinavian Peninsula remains a fundamental principle of Finnish policy. Since 1939 when Finland was forced to fight the Soviet Union alone, its attitude towards the Nordic countries has not changed. It hopes to maintain friendly relations with these countries after the war.

Finland Convenes Parliament in Secret to Discuss the Political Situation

Reuters, Berlin, August 8th - A German official news agency, citing a report from Helsinki, stated that Finnish Prime Minister Rangell convened a secret meeting of parliament yesterday to discuss the political situation.

### President Roosevelt Receives Taylor; The New York Herald Reports That Peace Can Be Achieved in the East

Reuters, Washington, August 8th - President Roosevelt received his personal representative to the Vatican, Taylor, yesterday. It is rumored that Taylor informed President Roosevelt of the grounds on which the Catholic Church could restore relations with the Soviet Union.

Reuters, New York, August 8th - The New York Herald today published an article under copyright stating that an agreement between China and Japan is possible. When President Roosevelt's personal representative to the Vatican, Taylor, and Pope Pius XII met in the Vatican, this issue was the main topic of their discussion. The newspaper stated that although the Pope is disappointed that peace has not yet been achieved in Europe, he believes that peace can be achieved in the East soon. Washington also holds this view.

Havas Agency, Rome, August 7th - An Italian newspaper recently published an editorial discussing the relationship between the Vatican and Britain and the United States, stating briefly that President Roosevelt's personal representative, Taylor, expressed that the United States is willing to negotiate with the Soviet Union to restore religious freedom. The Pope is paying close attention to this. Taylor's sudden trip to London has raised suspicions that the Catholic Church is engaged in some kind of worldwide activity. However, this move will draw the Vatican into the democratic camp, thereby demoralizing Italy and confusing the will of Catholics around the world. In short, the enemy's propaganda efforts are clearly intended to harm the Vatican and the Pope's detached position.

### Secretary of War Stimson Writes to the House of Representatives, Requesting the Severance of Existing Relations Between Japanese Americans and Japan

Reuters, Washington, August 8th - Secretary of War Stimson requested yesterday that action be taken to sever existing ties between Japanese Americans and Japan. Secretary of War Stimson wrote to House Speaker Rayburn, saying, "Any action that severs the ties between Japanese Americans and Japanese consuls, the government, and traditional ancestors will not only help us, but also those with dual citizenship." Rayburn submitted the Secretary of War's bill to the House Immigration Committee. The goal of this bill is to strengthen the ban on dual citizenship to enhance anti-espionage laws. Secretary of War Stimson stated that Japanese Americans born in the United States should legally be subject to Japanese conscription, while American citizens whose ancestors were Japanese, Italian, or German are mostly dual citizens, and are drafted into the U.S. Army by lottery.

### International Labor Conference to be Held in New York at the End of the Month; Britain Sends Attlee to Attend

### Nazi Fifth Column Activities in Turkey; Britain Denies Sending Note to Turkish Government; Germany's Request for Chromium Ore Rejected by Turkey

Reuters, London, August 8th - A German-controlled radio station in Paris reported that, according to a report from Ankara, the British and Soviet governments have jointly sent a note to Turkey regarding the activities of the German fifth column in Turkey. (This report has been denied here.)

Reuters, Ankara, August 8th - Nazi trade representative Clodius reportedly renewed his request for Turkish chromium ore in his numerous conversations with Turkish Minister of Justice Menemencioglu. It is rumored that the German side intends to find ways to gain more from the recently concluded trade agreement. According to the agreement, Turkey will sell half of its 1943 and 1944 chromium ore production to Germany in exchange for German military equipment, in order to avoid violating the Anglo-Turkish chromium agreement. In fact, Turkey's behavior in this matter is extremely honorable, as can be seen from its refusal to violate its existing treaty obligations despite German pressure. British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen and U.S. Ambassador MacMurray visited Turkish Foreign Minister Sarajoglu today, possibly to discuss the recent developments in the chromium issue.

### Germany and Turkey Issue Joint Declaration; The Two Countries Maintain Friendly Relations; Germany Has No Intention of Attacking Turkey

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, August 8th - According to a public statement issued here, reports regarding Germany's demands, use of pressure, and troop movements in an attempt to attack Turkey are unfounded.

Haitong News Agency, Ankara, August 8th - It was announced here today that Germany and Turkey have jointly issued a statement refuting the absurd rumors that Germany intends to attack Turkey. The content of the statement is the same as that announced in Berlin.

### Cuban President Issues Decree Designating Today as China Relief Day; Government Officials Promote the "One Bowl of Rice" Movement; Foreign Minister Kuo Sends Telegram to the Cuban President Expressing Gratitude

Chongqing - The Cuban President recently issued a decree designating the 9th as China Relief Day.

### Tripartite Economic Conference to be Convened to Plan Stabilization of Legal Tender; US Treasury Department Representative Has Returned from Shanghai; Rumor that Film Shipments to Shanghai Will Massively Supply Foreign Exchange; Chinese, British, and American Economic Commissioners Have All Gathered in Hong Kong

Since the Equalization Fund cracked down on the black market on the 8th of last month and announced the "Provisional Measures for Banks Specially Permitted to Engage in Foreign Exchange Business in September" and the "List of Goods Permitted for Import, Categories A and B" on the 9th, the black market has disappeared. Although there are remnants, the transactions are limited, becoming increasingly smaller, and insufficient to influence the market. The purpose of stopping speculation and arbitrage has been fully realized. This month, banks specially permitted to engage in foreign exchange have received notification from the Equalization Fund that the measures implemented in the past will continue to be effective. Goods listed on the list, such as rice, tobacco, petroleum products, and coal, can still be supplied with the same amount of foreign exchange. As for other goods, approval may or may not be granted, depending on the needs. However, with foreign exchange strictly managed, the development of foreign trade is restricted. Therefore, foreign business representatives have gone to Hong Kong to express their opinions to the Equalization Fund. Regarding how to stabilize the currency system and how to prevent the Japanese side from excluding the legal tender policy, China, Britain, and the United States will convene a tripartite economic conference in Hong Kong. Future developments are worth paying attention to. The news obtained yesterday is recorded below:

Conference Results of Great Importance

In the past week, the city's film industry, insurance industry, cotton industry, tobacco industry, and automobile industry have successively sent representatives to Hong Kong to explain the difficulties in the development of each industry. It is now known that the general manager of Citibank, Mr. Mackay, also went to Hong Kong last week, which is certainly related to this development. Mr. Currie, US President Roosevelt's personal economic envoy, accompanied by Yang Ge, advisor to the Chinese Ministry of Finance, and Fox, a US committee member of the Equalization Fund, flew to Hong Kong the day before yesterday. Two British economic experts, Mr. Niemeyer, Governor of the Bank of England, and Mr. Kirkland, technical assistant to the US Secretary of the Treasury, were invited by the Chinese government and will arrive in Hong Kong shortly, preparing to attend the Sino-British-American tripartite economic conference convened in Hong Kong to discuss how to stabilize the Chinese currency system and prevent the Japanese side from excluding the legal tender policy. Therefore, Hong Kong is crowded with dignitaries. Stabilizing the Chinese currency system is one of the tasks of the Equalization Fund. The importance of the results of this conference can be imagined. It is also heard that after the conference, Mr. Niemeyer will also visit Shanghai.

Mr. Arons to Return Home and Report

According to foreign sources, Mr. Arons, the economic advisor to the US Consul General, Mr. Lockhart, and the representative of the US Treasury Department, left Shanghai last Monday to return to the United States after staying in Shanghai for two weeks. It is heard that Mr. Arons has conducted a detailed investigation of the impact of the freezing order on Shanghai's trade and has completed his work. This decision to return to the United States is to provide this report to the US government. In addition, several US Treasury Department officials stationed in Shanghai have recently left Shanghai for Hong Kong to discuss with the Equalization Fund. Among them, Mr. Nicholson, the big one, will return to Shanghai next week.

Film Exchange Settlement Expected to be Maintained

The Dachung News Agency reporter once met with Mr. Doeltz, the Far East manager of Twentieth Century Fox Films. According to him, although the US freezing of Chinese funds has affected businesses related to foreign exchange transactions, film merchants in this city are planning appropriate measures to enable cinemas in this city to continue showing foreign films to entertain the citizens of this city. Mr. Doeltz returned to Shanghai on the President Coolidge on Tuesday (7th). According to him, although the Equalization Fund has not yet made a final decision, it is expected to decide to provide sufficient foreign exchange soon to allow cinemas in this city to operate as usual. He said that the American film industry has a very large business scope in Shanghai and is currently trying to maintain it. The cinema owners in this city were worried two weeks ago, fearing that the shipment of American films to Shanghai in the future would be hindered due to difficulties in obtaining foreign exchange. Now, listening to Mr. Doeltz's words, the doubts will be dispelled. It is also learned that Mr. Haig, the manager of Asian Theatres Corporation, who went to Hong Kong some time ago to contact the authorities of the Equalization Fund on this issue, has not yet left Hong Kong.

Why Supply Foreign Exchange for Tobacco, etc.?

Havas World Telegraph Agency, Chongqing, 8th. The Ta Kung Pao commented on the foreign exchange policy, saying that the goods listed in the A and B tables of Shanghai's imported goods that the Equalization Fund stipulates to supply foreign exchange require 12 million US dollars per month, while the foreign exchange that can be obtained from goods exported to Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and India is only 6 million per month. The monthly difference is at least 6 million. This number will either require the Equalization Fund to use its funds or will cause the revival of the black market. However, tobacco in Table A is actually not related to the livelihood of Shanghai citizens, so why supply foreign exchange for it? British and American aid to China must have a broad vision and should not be premised on the interests of their businessmen in Shanghai and the occupied areas. It is hoped that the British and American financial and economic delegation will pay close attention to this point and reconsider the Equalization Fund's foreign exchange policy to make it more reasonable.

### Daylight Saving Time to be Abolished Next Month

According to a statement released by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Department, as a result of discussions between the Council and the French Concession Municipal Council, it has been decided to abolish daylight saving time from Saturday, November 1st. At that time, all clocks under the Bureau's jurisdiction will be turned back one hour at midnight on that day.

### German Women and Children Unable to Leave the Country and Settle in Shanghai

According to Japanese newspapers, more than 100 German women and children who retreated from the Dutch East Indies on the Asama Maru in July this year originally planned to take a convenient ship back to their country. However, since the war in Europe has not yet ended, they have been unable to leave Shanghai due to environmental constraints. With the assistance of German expatriates in Shanghai, they bought the Shanghai Sanatorium (Italian capital) at 201 Hongqiao Road and rebuilt it into the "German Home." Seventy German expatriate women and children have moved there. At 4 p.m. on the 7th, Lieutenant Colonel Oigami and Major Ishii, who were in charge of security in the vicinity, and two leaders of the Nazi Party in China, Mr. Yesner and Mr. Kureka, and German staff of the Shanghai Municipal Council, invited people from all walks of life to visit. The facility has 32 rooms, as well as a large garden and medical room.

### National Day Commemoration Tomorrow; Telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to Pay Respects; Strict Security Precautions in the International Settlement for One Day

Tomorrow is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. All agencies, groups, schools, and factories in the city will be closed as usual and fly the national flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun for one day to celebrate. The consulates and warships of various countries in Shanghai and the agencies of the two settlements will also fly flags and close. People from all walks of life are actively promoting the four major movements of saving the country through frugality, raising winter clothing, building national savings, and National Day contributions. They will also send a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to pay respects. Furthermore, with the heroic and brave fighting of the Chinese army in various places in recent days, frequent reports of victory have boosted the morale of the people. Therefore, it is planned to take this opportunity to send a telegram in the name of the city's 3.5 million citizens to the front lines to express the highest respect. The settlement will implement strict security precautions for one day from tomorrow morning for prevention.

### Foreign Exchange Settlement for Imported Goods Limited to Necessities; Procedures for Applying for Foreign Exchange Becoming Increasingly Strict

According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 8th, Tong Mengzheng, director of the First Division of the Foreign Exchange Control Commission, stated that government agencies and institutions applying for foreign exchange should follow the procedures stipulated in the "Instructions for Applying for Foreign Exchange" issued by the Commission. The institutions referred to are state-owned, publicly-owned, and jointly-owned industrial and commercial enterprises and all public utilities. As for the foreign exchange required by general private factories, shops, and individuals, they should apply to the Equalization Fund Committee and may entrust the Central Bank in various places to forward the application. After approval by the Committee, the designated bank will be notified to settle the purchase. However, the imported goods must be absolutely necessary for the country.

Procedures for Applying for Foreign Exchange Strictly Controlled

It is heard that the procedures for applying for foreign exchange will be stricter than in the past. Previously, the application form contained a total of ten items, of which seven items from the second to the eighth, regarding the investigation of imported goods, were filled out by the importer first, and then the first item (name and address of the bank), the ninth item (remarks), and the tenth item (guarantee) were filled out by the handling bank before being submitted to the Equalization Fund for review. The content of the application form has now been expanded to eighteen items. All items from the first to the eighteenth are filled out by the importer, and the application is made to the bank. The name and address of the cost manufacturer, the circumstances related to the transaction, the payment method, the approximate date when foreign exchange is needed for consumption, must be described in detail, and five guarantees must be signed. Afterwards, the bank's guarantee letter and the Equalization Fund's approval will be indicated on the application form. The full text of the content is translated below:

This time, the USS Coolidge of the American President Lines, came to Shanghai from Honolulu. During the voyage in the section of Manila, the United States government dispatched a warship to escort it. The organization of the escort fleet was composed of one cruiser, one armed oil tanker, and several small E-type ships. At that time, the vessel enforced strict lighting control during the voyage. At that time, it was rumored that there was a piratical ship cruising within the route, so the vessel detoured the route and travelled for four days. The vessel carried an entire squadron of US tank troops to Manila, with a total of 54 tanks and 2,400 soldiers, which was the first time the United States had dispatched troops to Manila. After the battalion landed in Manila, the Coolidge continued to sail to Hong Kong and Shanghai. The US warship discontinued the escort because it was no longer necessary. The vessel arrived in Shanghai from the United States via Little Luzon and Hong Kong the day before yesterday and berthed at Buoy No. 11 and 12. After staying in Shanghai for one night and fourteen hours, it is scheduled to sail directly to Honolulu at 9:30 this morning.

This decision to go to Honolulu is to stay for four or five months before returning to Shanghai. The total number of people from this city who took the vessel to the United States has not yet been announced. One hundred US troops stationed in the Philippines, who have served in the East for two wars, were ordered to return to their country and took the vessel to Shanghai and then took the original vessel from Shanghai, taking the route through Honolulu back to San Francisco. Mr. Pittonson, a member of the US Embassy in China, also returned to the United States from Hong Kong via the President Coolidge.

The yarn market, which had soared the previous day, jumped in the morning but then turned into a disastrous decline. This situation was frightening. This kind of manipulation is truly terrifying. In short, the speculative market can rise sharply in a straight line, but it will also fall sharply. Therefore, "be careful of fire." This meaning was mentioned yesterday. At the beginning of the morning's trading, due to the bears' frantic covering, there had been a shift to the bull side the day before. The bulls took advantage of the momentum to chase, only to discover a state of panic that could not be contained. The first round of bidding jumped to 2,100 yuan, and soon rose to 2,116 yuan. At this time, the market was as chaotic as hemp. Immediately, some profitable people sold off, and the market showed a rapid decline again, falling straight to 2,020 yuan. Its momentum was already apparent, and precautions should have been taken. However, there were still moths flying into the flame, ignoring the dangers, and continuing to drag in. Around 12 o'clock, the exchange's cloth prices soared, and people's hearts were burning. It rose again to 2,106 yuan at the close. Unexpectedly, the leading cloth in the exchange fell sharply by one or two yuan at the close, saying that customs had again banned exports. The market in the afternoon was greatly shaken. Shuangma opened down 106 yuan, at 2,000 yuan, and the bears covered their positions, rising again to 2,050 yuan. However, the general trend could not be reversed. When the exchange opened, the benchmark yarn fell 110 yuan per lot, and cloth prices fell by 3 yuan, a precipitous decline. Therefore, the Shuangma factory could not support the price alone and fell straight to 1,930 yuan, declaring a limit down. However, there were still people covering short positions outside the market, and it rose again to 1,965 yuan. Since the price was high, the floating longs closed their positions, and the shorts increased their pressure, side by side, and it fell again to 1,930 yuan, declaring a second limit down. The changes in the past two days have been a huge blow. The worst are those who turned from short to long. They just wanted to go up the cliff to get their packages, but unexpectedly a great wind rose again, and they followed it into Kyushu. Another kind of new long who followed in was celebrating and preparing a banquet, but unexpectedly there was such a big reversal, and in the end, it was all in vain. It is known that speculation is not easy. Without the ability to specially manipulate the market, don't even think about touching it. It's better to be safe and not think about getting rich. As for how the changes will be after this, who can predict? However, in this kind of situation, not to mention the yarn market, even in other aspects, as long as there is an opportunity to manipulate, new tricks will eventually occur. Today, 220 pieces of yarn are shipped to Hong Kong. Let's see if we want to go ashore before leaving. Yesterday's half-day transaction statistics showed 18,120 bales. The amount purchased by each port is listed as follows:

Jin Shuangma Futures Market Conditions: Violent surges and sharp declines, truly like the surging of anger. The ups and downs were unprecedented since the market opened. However, due to the relationship between margin calls and limit down throughout the day, only two rounds of trading were done. When the market opened in the morning, the factory orders had already soared by seventy or eighty yuan. However, due to margin calls from all parties, the futures yarn did not open. The floating longs who had made profits saw the spot market turn sharply downward and were unable to sell out in a panic. Waiting for the factory orders to open again, they saw an increase. Therefore, the opening price for October futures was 1,840 yuan. At that time, the longs saw the factory orders trending upward, not only stopping selling but also buying more, so they rose to 1,970 yuan. The November futures opened at 2,000 yuan, and then slightly declined. The December futures opened at 1,990 yuan, and then, following the rebound of the factory orders, rose to a new high of 2,035 yuan. The noon closing was 2,032 yuan. In the afternoon, there was a sudden rumor of a ban on exports, and people were alarmed, with a sense of impending storm. Therefore, the longs were forced to cut their positions, and they plummeted by more than one hundred yuan, all declaring limit down. Looking at the trend, the factory orders also soared in May of this year, and then plummeted due to the export ban. This was due to the reduction in the production of local cotton and the smaller amount of American cotton imported, which led to an increase in the cost of yarn and formed a bullish factor, pulling the price up to a new high of more than 2,100 yuan, making it impossible for the shorts to catch their breath. Therefore, the pullback is also normal. Therefore, if the market price falls too much, those engaged in it should pay attention. The table is listed below:

The cotton market, which has been crazy for days, was affected yesterday by rumors that the customs would ban cotton yarn. The market price of yarn and cloth has seen a disastrous decline. The cotton market public does not underestimate it. The factory's yarn has no sales, and cotton can still be deeply hidden and left for a long time. As a result, transactions have been greatly diminished.

Eastern Cloth Plunges – Limit Down in the Afternoon –

Factory cloth market rose first and then weakened yesterday, due to rumors that the customs would ban the export of yarn and cloth again. People were frightened and turned buying into reality. The cloth price suddenly fell. As a result, compared with the previous day, coarse cloth still rose by two and a half to five corners, fine cloth twill was flat, and bleached and dyed cloth partly saw mixed ups and downs. More than 600 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. The Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang gangs had a strong intention to trade in the morning, and more than 500 pieces were traded. However, they all stopped trading in the afternoon. The Zhejiang Dong Dinghai industry traded nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth. On the 9th, 480 pieces of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong.

　　東布狂升疾、起伏甚鉅、蓋晨市因紗價繼續暴漲、人心一致向上、迭見高峰、龍頭細布一月份貨巳將叩七十元之大關、詎知收盤時、驀地起風波、海關又將佈吿禁運之說、傳遍市塲、後市言人人殊、賣聲益盛、故各月份期布僅拍頭盤而止、二盤起均停板、結果較前日俱猛跌每疋二元五角至三元七角、現貨市塲情形相同、惟收盤時緣同業實銷尙可、搜羅拉提、回升三四角、龍頭細布廠單為六十四元三角五分、叫君子嗶嘰新單二元三角三分半、
Eastern cloth rose sharply and fell greatly. The morning market was due to the continued soaring of yarn prices, and people's hearts were unanimously upward, and peaks were seen repeatedly. The leading fine cloth in January was about to knock on the 70 yuan mark. Who knew that at the close, there was a sudden storm, and the customs were about to announce the ban on exports, which spread throughout the market. The later market varied from person to person, and the selling sound was more prosperous. Therefore, the futures cloth in each month only took the first round of bidding, and all rounds from the second round were limit down. As a result, compared with the previous day, they all plummeted by 2 yuan and 5 corners to 3 yuan and 7 corners per piece. The spot market situation was the same. However, at the close, due to the fact that the actual sales of the same industry were still acceptable, they searched for and pulled up, and rebounded by three or four corners. The leading fine cloth factory order was 64 yuan, 3 corners and 5 points, and the new gentleman's serge order was 2 yuan, 3 corners and 3 and a half points.

Yesterday's gold market, which was red and dark, suddenly rebounded and fell sharply. Both futures and spot prices took the rise and fall of the current yarn as a transfer. The ups and downs were uncertain in the middle. Although cash saw the silver shop gang, the Tianjin gang, and the Hong Kong gang's money exchange industry vigorously advancing, the cash shop, the securities gang's bank, and Xianghe sold off, and the price from the morning opening of 9,990 yuan still stepped down to the closing of 9,600 yuan, squeezing small 400 yuan. Futures gold was also because the draft merchants and the Tianjin gang and Dingsheng scrambled to sell, and sharply moved from 7,830 yuan to 7,650 yuan. The Hong Kong gang absorbed it, and it rebounded by 100 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the transaction was thin, and it fell again, and finally saw a squeeze of 105 yuan. More than 200 taels were traded, and decorative gold was also squeezed small by 30 yuan.

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: The Central Bank and HSBC's two listings were both flat, and the British and American exchange small counter prices were both flat. There were many applications for exchange settlement. It was heard that the Stabilization Fund continued to return the application forms for the settlement of Zijiu grapes and private tobacco, resulting in the tightening of the British and American exchange black market. A certain foreign bank outside the fourteen banks actually entered and exited the telegraphic transfer of four yuan, three corners and five points for import and export merchants. A Japanese bank entered a certain foreign bank with a ticket price of four yuan, six corners and eight and three quarter points. The market situation was chaotic, and there was no fixed market price. There were even telegraphic transfers that were sold for four yuan. The approximate noon closing was British exchange two office worker six two five, and the American exchange four yuan two five, which was flatter than the previous day's British exchange and the American exchange tightened one two five. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. Tianjin reported on the 8th (Wednesday) that the foreign exchange market opened flat this morning. The telegraphic transfers in London and New York still had no honor or disgrace. The Shen exchange rose by two yuan and a half, and the "United Banknotes" black market slightly rose by two corners and five points, to forty-seven yuan, two corners and five points.

美鈔可代美滙　豈止破壞匯市　亦且威脅生活
American Dollar Can Replace American Exchange Rate, Not Only Destroying the Exchange Market But Also Threatening Life

　　昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊隨現金價各跌五元、英金票回落一元、美金票變動至巨、始做二十四元四角、繼而步退至三元八角、嚮午父高至四元二角、晚市復退為二十四元、比上日軋跌二角、總之、美鈔如可替代美滙美常局亦仍曲意優容、置之不問、不但美鈔行市軒輊甚鉅、亦且物價受共刺激、終將上漲無已、為害所及、豈止無形中破壤平準會之舉動、實間接予中國人生活以威脅、港票繼續趨漲、晚市升為五元六角、日金票略趨疲軟、晚市退為二元四角三分、朝鮮票續漲一分、晚市升為二元零八分、
Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: British and American gold pounds fell by five yuan each following the cash price, British gold notes fell by one yuan, American gold notes changed greatly, starting at twenty-four yuan and four corners, and then stepping back to three yuan and eight corners. At noon, the father was as high as four yuan and two corners, and the evening market fell back to twenty-four yuan, which was two corners lower than the previous day. In short, if the American dollar can replace the American exchange rate, the American authorities still try to accommodate it and ignore it. Not only is the American dollar market fluctuating greatly, but also prices are stimulated and will eventually rise endlessly. The harm caused is not only destroying the actions of the Stabilization Fund invisibly, but also indirectly threatening the lives of Chinese people. Hong Kong notes continued to rise, and the evening market rose to five yuan and six corners. Japanese gold notes were slightly weaker, and the evening market fell to two yuan, four corners and three points. Korean notes continued to rise by one point, and the evening market rose to two yuan and eight points.

The foreign rice market opened after the Xiao Chao holiday. Unexpectedly, yesterday there was a sudden violent rise, which was caused by the soaring of various commodities recently, which caused the eyes of non-industry customers to turn red. They believed that the price of rice was uniquely small and profitable, so they absorbed it together, which led to a storm. When the market opened in the early morning, the general mindset of transactions immediately echoed each other, and they ran around together. For a time, those who held goods took the opportunity to pull up the price, and the shouting was crazy. The prices of all types soared unanimously. At the highest time, No. 1 Saigon high-quality goods actually opened to the 140 yuan mark. The bank's small white squeezed 25 yuan, and the foreign bank also had to be 124 and a half yuan, which was a sharp increase of 13 yuan compared with the previous market. At this point, because the price was booming, the general profitable floating households came out one after another, and the big households also felt that the price was high and difficult to handle. At the same time, the actual sales in the local countryside were still not smooth, so the rise gradually frustrated, and it gradually showed a soft color. It was soft all the way down, and because there was a public warehouse in this street that distributed at a flat price, the market price was more than 120 yuan, which was bound to be too different from the market price of 110 and a half yuan. It can only be used by speculators as a bargaining chip. However, the profitable floating longs have already sold off at a high price, and the new hoarders are also watching. In addition, rumors are rising, people's hearts are confused, and the selling pressure is great. The small squeezed rice immediately plummeted under the dual pressure of reality and people's hearts, as low as 122 yuan. In the afternoon, the selling pressure was even stronger, and the shouting price was lowered by another one or two yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was still 20,000 bags, and Yinghua Company had five or six hundred tons.

The public value black market: Yesterday, the Sichuan gang still sold out, and the market price continued to weaken. The draw for the 12th issue of Type C was changed to today in advance because the 10th was a holiday. Therefore, yesterday afternoon's market price was calculated after deducting the winning numbers, but it was only four or five corners smaller than the morning.

### Report of Gauze Export Ban - Jianghai Customs Has Not Issued a Notice - The Truth Remains Difficult to Confirm

In recent months, the Japanese Deputy Customs Commissioner of the General Affairs Department of Jianghai Customs has repeatedly decided to issue proclamations prohibiting the export of cotton textiles, but then immediately and independently cancelled them. Yesterday afternoon, a sudden commotion arose in the gauze market. It was found that the customs had repeatedly decided to ban exports, and the Japanese Customs Commissioner of the General Affairs Department would first issue a notice. However, as of last night, the General Affairs Department of the Customs had not issued the aforementioned ban notice, and senior customs officials had not yet confirmed it. The truth is still difficult to predict. According to sources in the customs brokerage industry, recently, Japanese customs officials have been very strict with the inspection procedures for goods declared for Hong Kong and Singapore, fearing that they would be transshipped to free zones. Without conclusive proof, goods are often rejected. Yesterday afternoon, there were also many such rejected cotton textiles. However, yesterday afternoon, the number of cotton textiles shipped to Hong Kong and other ports was still very large. Furthermore, according to people in the cotton industry, a certain party has been affected by the freezing of British and American funds, resulting in a severe shortage of cotton. The cotton harvest in the occupied areas this year has also been very poor. If the export of gauze is completely prohibited, Britain and the United States will also completely prohibit the shipment of cotton from the United States, Canada, India, and Egypt to Shanghai in order to resist. Therefore, the Japanese side will find it difficult to thoroughly implement the ban.

### Free French National Aigre Returns to Shanghai - Spirit Unchanged from the Past - No Comment on the Current Situation

Mr. Aigre, a well-known French merchant in this city who had been separated from Shanghai residents for half a year, gracefully returned to his old haunt on the afternoon of the 7th. Aigre was previously arrested by the French authorities here on the orders of the Vichy government, accused of sympathizing with the de Gaulle movement, and imprisoned on a French gunboat. The case caused a sensation for a time, and he was taken to Saigon for trial by local officials. Later, he was released with the assistance of Vice Admiral Layton of the British Far East Fleet. Mr. Aigre stayed in Singapore for quite some time, and visited Commander Park Fang and Vice Admiral Layton, among others. Mr. Aigre arrived the day before yesterday afternoon from Hong Kong on the President Coolidge, accompanied by Mr. Margis, a Far East correspondent for the Free French News Agency. Those who went to the pier to welcome him that day included Mr. Alexander of the British Intelligence Department and Mr. Aigre's family members. Mr. Aigre was dressed in casual dark blue clothes, frequently twirling his cane, with a calm demeanor, unlike someone who had suffered hardships. However, his complexion was dark and his temples seemed slightly gray. He expressed great concern about the current situation in Shanghai. It is said that he will resume his old business and will move to the International Settlement. When asked about the inside story of the Singapore conference, he smiled but did not answer.

### Rice from Warehouses - To Be Sold at Fixed Prices the Day After Tomorrow

The registration of rice from rice merchants' warehouses for fixed-price sale, which lasted for four days, ended on the 6th. It is understood that the amount of rice from warehouses that has been approved for fixed-price sale is over 45,000 bags. The remaining 12,000 to 3,000 bags have not yet been approved. Now, in order to universally sell rice from warehouses and achieve the purpose of disaster relief, the association will allow those who have not registered for the fixed-price sale of rice from warehouses to bring their shop seals to the Rice Merchants' Association starting tomorrow to complete the procedures for the fixed-price sale of rice from warehouses. As for those who have already completed the registration procedures and paid the money to receive the delivery order (rice merchants who are members of the International Settlement), they will all start picking up the goods from the Roosevelt Wharf warehouse at 9:00 AM yesterday, based on the order. The rice can be sold at fixed prices by more than 900 rice shops in the two settlements starting at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 11th of this month. The rice shops can earn a net profit of three yuan per picul. At the same time, after the rice is sold out, the empty bags also belong to the rice shops. Therefore, each rice shop that sells rice from warehouses can earn a profit of seven or eight yuan per picul.

### Eight Elders Witness a Happy Marriage - A Quick Sketch of the Cold Chan Elder's Wedding - Hosted by Chen Tao Yi, Witnessed by Shen Xinqing and Tang Weizhi - The Groom Nearing Seventy in Scarlet Attire Against White Hair

Mr. Min Ruizhi, a respected elder from Yun Jian, at the advanced age of sixty-eight, married Ms. Feng Kejing, a noblewoman from Baoshan, in a ceremony of remarriage held at the Pudong Mansion the day before yesterday (the 7th). Distinguished guests and elders gathered in one hall, with white hair and scarlet attire shining in contrast, truly a rare grand occasion in Shanghai. Thus, what was seen and heard in the wedding hall is recounted in the following anecdotes:

The groom, also known as the Cold Chan Elder, whose Chan heart has not cooled and whose old vigor is still high, is energetic and no different from a young man. On this day, he mingled among the guests, his speech lively and showing no signs of fatigue. One of the guests said that the elder had recently taken tonics, hence his radiant appearance and vigorous spirit, preparing to cope with the joys of the new marriage. The humorous and unexpected remarks drew laughter from the hall.

The bride, Ms. Feng Kejing, is twenty-seven years younger than the groom, petite in stature, reaching only to the groom's shoulder, but with a plump figure, her steps possessing a serene beauty, just like her beautiful name.

When the wedding ceremony was in progress, the red candles burned high, and the hall was filled with auspiciousness. Onlookers could not help but smile, vying to catch a glimpse of this elderly newlywed couple. The wedding officials were "Candle Lighters" Gao Chuiwan and Dai Boyin, "Introducers" Jin Jushan and Shi Wencai, "Witnesses" Shen Xinlao and Tang Weilao, "Host for the Groom's Side" Chen Taolao, and "Host for the Bride's Side" Feng Zilao. Apart from the witnesses who were already in their old age, most of the others present were elders over sixty years old. Together with the groom, they numbered nine elders, their gathering was an unprecedented sight.

The wedding ceremony adopted a new style. When the new couple bowed to each other, the angle was ninety degrees, fully meeting the standard, demonstrating the demeanor of the older generation. The witness, Mr. Shen Enfu, first delivered a speech, citing the Book of Changes, "The man is in his proper place outside, and the woman is in her proper place inside," to attest to the great principle of marriage between men and women. Then, his tone turned, quoting a humorous saying from your esteemed residence: "A woman marrying in old age can become a ready-made grandmother, which is the cheapest thing in the world." The father quoted a humorous saying from an old friend in Longmen: "An old man remarrying is adding an uncle for his grandson," presumably to wish the Cold Chan Elder a son. In addition to humor, he fully demonstrated the ability to praise and pray. Mr. Tang Wenzhi rose to give a speech, recounting old friendships and conveying congratulations. His demeanor was solemn, and his words were relatively simple. The voice of Mr. Chen Tao Yi was the clearest, praising the elder's marriage as a celestial union, and his wording was appropriate for both the host and the representative of the guests. After the ceremony, during the photo session, the groom reverted to his old ways, repeatedly stroking his beard, causing those who saw it to suppress their laughter.

This grand wedding was all instructed by the Master Mu Daoren of the Shanjitan altar, and the elder followed the master's instructions. Mr. Jin Julao was responsible for handling the details.

Attached is a poem sent by Mu Daoren to Cold Chan: "The Cold Chan's wedding is not far away, calculated to be two nights after Mid-Autumn Festival. No couplets written, no poems composed, wanting to completely eliminate the superstitious atmosphere. Don't send vegetarian meals to Suzhou, don't blame Cold Chan for being too lax in etiquette. I am already empty and have no nose or tongue, how can I put in the effort to eat? It is said that the bride's surname is Feng, a celebration for a bountiful year, foretelling agricultural success. Cultivate the field of love with many seeds of affection, the spring planting and autumn harvest are in mind. When the auspicious ceremony is completed, I will also come, the feast will be held at the Pudong Mansion. Invite Uncle Gongchang, don't miss, ask the newspapers to blow their horns."

Sun Cangsou, a famous scholar from Nantong, wrote a催妆 poem congratulating the Cold Chan Elder on his remarriage: "A well-matched couple is this union, meeting on a moonlit night is like a dream. Cold Chan's heart tonight should be like this, come to participate in the joyful Chan. It is most difficult to accompany flowers in old age, this is the time to enjoy life. Too much embrace following the mother's example, teach him to twist off a few strands of his beard. Auspicious time with green wine and red lanterns, old age with amorous feelings and joy is full. Beware of my master being near, dare to say that spring is fully concentrated. Don't just write about pear blossoms pressing crabapples, only know that there is withered poplar above the ladder. Next year, when the Tang Bing feast is a great gathering, I will send a note inviting me to taste it together."

### Murder Case at the San Tai Hotel Yesterday Afternoon - Li Dehui Shot Dead - He Specialized in Taking Care of Goods at the Pier During His Life - He Died After Being Shot Twice, The Murderer Escaped

At 11:45 AM yesterday, a sudden assassination occurred at the San Tai Inn at 484 Jiujiang Road in the International Settlement. The victim was Li Dehui, nicknamed Jiangbei Xiao Li, one of the thirty-six gangs on the pier. The details of the case are as follows:

Long-term Residence in a Room - Bundling Goods

Li Dehui, a native of Tongzhou, was forty years old and nicknamed Jiangbei Xiao Li. He was a well-known member of the thirty-six gangs on the Pujiang Pier. He usually specialized in taking care of the transportation, loading, and unloading of goods at the pier for a living. He lived in room 17 of the San Tai Inn at 484 Jiujiang Road in the International Settlement. His wife and two sons and two daughters also lived there, and had been there for over a year.

A Man in a Western Suit - Burst in and Opened Fire

At around 11:45 AM yesterday, Li was wearing a striped woolen short shirt and pants, and yellow leather shoes. While he was chatting with someone in the lobby downstairs of the inn, a murderer in a dark gray suit suddenly led two men in. The suit-wearing murderer, upon seeing Li, immediately drew a pistol without asking any questions and fired two shots at Li. Both bullets hit Li's head. Li, wounded and in pain, fell into a pool of blood, his head facing south and his feet facing north.

Hit by Two Bullets - Died from Serious Injuries

The three murderers, seeing that they had hit their target, turned and fled out of the inn, disappearing in an instant. Mr. Ye, the inn's accountant, upon seeing the murder, quickly reported it to the police by telephone. The police dispatched officers to investigate and sent the wounded man to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment. However, because Li's bullets had entered his brain and his injuries were severe, he died on the way in the ambulance before arriving at the hospital. Afterwards, the police questioned Li's wife and the inn's accountant about the details of the incident in order to find clues to solve the case.

### Missing Soldier from the Lone Army Camp

It has been half a year since then, and things have been peaceful. A few days ago, a soldier suffered from severe tuberculosis and wanted to go out for medical treatment. When he discussed it with the White Russian captain stationed there, he was not allowed to leave. As a result, it was delayed for several days. Yesterday afternoon, the soldier suffering from tuberculosis took advantage of an opportunity to escape without a trace. When the White Russians found out, they lodged a serious protest with Commander Lei and made three demands: (1) Add a sentry post; (2) Add another layer of barbed wire; (3) The White Russians must conduct a roll call twice a day. After the above conditions were proposed, all the soldiers inside expressed dissatisfaction upon hearing the news and clamored together, creating a stalemate. All internal and external telephone lines were cut off. The turmoil had not yet been resolved by midnight.
