### Feeling Weary of Hopeless Invasion of China

A Chinese military spokesman in Chongqing stated today regarding the failed Japanese attempt to send a foreign minister to the United States to conclude a non-aggression pact, believing it to be plausible. The spokesman said that Japan is facing military difficulties in mainland China and is therefore attempting to improve diplomatic relations. The spokesman also stated that the Japanese report of 2,000 Chinese troops entering Burma is actually a pretext for the Japanese army themselves to ravage Thailand and Burma. The more than one million Japanese troops in mainland China have clearly realized the hopelessness of the war against China and are feeling weary. Therefore, apart from coastal battles, they cannot achieve any further success. The spokesman also said that he had not heard whether the Japanese army had withdrawn from Manchuria after the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. The spokesman further predicted that the Japanese army would launch an offensive in central China in the near future, as the Japanese army has concentrated in the western and southern parts of Hubei. This offensive may proceed west from Yichang or south towards Changsha. The spokesman concluded by saying that the Chinese are prepared to deal with all situations. If the Japanese army launches an offensive in the central part of the Yangtze River basin, they will inevitably be defeated by the Chinese army. (1st Associated Press dispatch)

Editorial

### The Problem of the Bureau of Public Works Selling Rice

Today's rice market in Shanghai can truly be described as a spectacle of extreme volatility. The price assessment method was abolished invisibly, and after the sudden issuance of a new price limit, no efforts were made to seek follow-up measures for the market. Instead, the market was left to its own devices, with black market premiums jumping wildly until, inexplicably, it was repealed again. Rice merchants had already regarded the price limit as nothing and the bans as trifling matters. As the authorities repeatedly undermined their own credibility, the arrogance of unscrupulous merchants grew, and the goal of 150 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) was finally achieved as desired. Rice merchants have fattened their purses, while the masses are facing starvation. Is this what "normal rice business" should lead to? So-called normal business refers to the normal laws of supply and demand, with market conditions changing accordingly. Currently, Shanghai's rice reserves, based solely on warehouse figures, amount to more than one million bags. Daily rice arrivals, according to our newspaper's investigations, reach tens of thousands of bags. The source has not been interrupted, consumption has not increased or decreased, and rice reserves are only increasing, yet the price of rice rises by several yuan every day, soaring continuously. As a result, unscrupulous merchants unscrupulously declare, "If you want to get rich quick, hoard rice!" Although this does not involve stealing goods in the market or killing people on the road, its nature and consequences are a form of plunder that spares neither the rich nor the poor, and is akin to bloodless murder. Yet, it is still regarded as normal business and not interfered with. No wonder the unscrupulous merchants are growing bolder, and the food difficulties of the people are deepening.

The rice-hoarding unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai are as venomous as snakes and as greedy as wolves. The people of Shanghai know this, and the world has heard of it. However, there has never been such a blatant display of ugliness as there is today. The Bureau of Public Works wants to have them sell Hong Kong rice, claiming that the current rice is already extremely expensive, and that going through merchants will only increase costs. It would be better for rice shops to buy and sell directly, so that more households can receive practical benefits, or so they say. They think it sounds pleasing to the ear, and that it is high-sounding, but who doesn't know that it is a heartless statement? Does the Bureau of Public Works not know that each additional intermediary adds a commission, which ultimately burdens the people's food supply? Does the Bureau of Public Works not know that it is not a commercial organization, and that its current involvement in transporting and selling rice is solely to benefit residents? Why then, do they still want rice merchants to provide the labor of distribution? Not only is it for convenience, but also because it is considered a public service. Not all rice merchants are unscrupulous, and those in the industry should take this opportunity to serve the public and distinguish themselves from the unscrupulous. Yet, they flatly refused by way of a resolution, thus revealing themselves nakedly as snakes and wolves. Their intention is simply because the 25,000 tons of foreign rice supplied monthly are insufficient to meet the needs of the citizens, and they can no longer manipulate the massive quantities of rice they have hoarded in warehouses, nor can they sell it at the high prices they currently enjoy. Once the Bureau of Public Works sets this precedent, the rice industry will never have the opportunity to manipulate prices again. Furthermore, we have the greatest suspicion: Are all members of the industry tigers, wolves, snakes, and scorpions? Are they all completely heartless? If not, why would they make such a hasty resolution, without leaving any face for the entire industry? If not the entire industry, then who are the moths among them?

In this matter, the Bureau of Public Works has obtained the assistance of the Hong Kong government, which can ship 20,000 to 25,000 tons of Xiao Jiao rice to Shanghai each month to stabilize the market and sell it to the public at reasonable prices. This is truly good news for the people's food supply and the first success of the Bureau of Public Works in addressing the food problem. The important thing to consider going forward is how to distribute this rice so that it can fairly and effectively reach the hands of consumers. Since the rice industry has refused to sell it, how should the Bureau of Public Works seek a better sales method? We have no doubt that the Bureau of Public Works will be unable to dispose of the rice and that households will be unable to purchase it. However, we absolutely do not want the Bureau of Public Works to indulge, condone, or fail to punish such heartless individuals! It occurs to us that the right to approve business licenses for rice shops is in the hands of the Bureau of Public Works, so there is a "necessity" and a possibility for suppression. At the same time, we should reward those in the rice industry who are truly able to serve the public and abide by the law and are happy to distribute rice. At the point of distribution, the Bureau of Public Works should issue glass boxes with rice samples displayed prominently on the counter, so that households can purchase rice according to the samples. From now on, the Bureau of Public Works should do everything possible to ensure that this rice supply is not interrupted by any accident and continue to provide a steady supply to benefit the people's food. Furthermore, the current price of 110 yuan per shi is still too expensive in light of the general standard of living. Can it be reduced within the possible range in the future? Also, how to prevent flat-price rice from being diverted into the hands of hoarders, who would exploit it and harm the people's food supply, is a complex matter that must be considered. We deeply feel that the Shanghai food problem has seen a glimmer of hope thanks to the efforts of the Bureau of Public Works. However, there are still many hidden reefs ahead, and we rely heavily on the helmsman to navigate through these treacherous waters. This is fortunate for the social order of Shanghai.

### Guo Taiqi Delivers Speech, Deeply Hoping that the United States Will Provide Substantial Aid to China; The Inseparable Relationship Between China, Britain, and the United States; Should No Longer Provide Japan with Military Materials and Raw Materials

New York: Dr. Dun Taiqi, a Chinese diplomat who is about to depart for Chongqing to take up his new post, declared here yesterday that China, Britain, and the United States should cooperate and concentrate their economic and military resources to preserve democracy in the world. Guo also called on the United States not to sell any more raw materials to Japan, and guaranteed that China would never stop fighting the aggressors, no matter what. This was Guo's first public speech since arriving here from London. He made this speech at a banquet hosted by the American Institute of Pacific Relations, the Chinese Association in America, the Chinese Benevolent Association, the Shanghai Luncheon Club, and the United China Relief at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Guo said that the naval and land goals of Britain and the United States are inseparably linked to China's ability to prevent Japan from consolidating its imperialism in the Pacific. He said, "Today, countless enlightened people in the United States know that if Britain is the European front line of the United States, then China is the Asian front line of the United States. As the war is tending to expand to the South Pacific, China's plans for the current democratic countries will gradually become important partners. As the war has spread to the whole of Burma and Singapore, the southwestern provinces of China will become the main base of operations. Southwest China will be the turning point for democratic countries in the Pacific War. Therefore, your country (referring to the United States), Britain, and China have a common relationship. I deeply hope that your country can do its best to help us to consolidate the defense of this region. I dare to appeal to the American people that your country should stop supplying raw materials to Japan, especially oil and other military supplies. In the past, the United States supplied these items to Japan, enabling the Japanese army and its air force to kill our women and children and destroy our houses and factories." Dr. Guo Taiqi then paid tribute to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, calling him a symbol of China's unity and the driving force behind its resistance to Japan. Guo said, "China's future freedom and independence will largely depend on the speed and thoroughness with which the United States helps China. Our biggest problem today is the attitude and method of cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States. This combination of ABC (America, Britain, China) is not only aimed at forming a united spiritual front line, but also at concentrating our economic and natural resources. We face many difficulties at present, and the task is extremely difficult. Whether we stand or fall depends on whether we deeply understand this task and undertake it with the greatest courage and speed." Guo also said that China, almost bare-handed, has proven its ability to resist Japan and has brought one million Japanese troops in China to a standstill. He also said, "It is true that the Chinese people have suffered enormous losses in terms of material, territory, and life, but we know that if we value freedom, this is the price of freedom. We seek nothing but freedom. China has been wounded, but it has not been defeated. China will hold on to its guns in any environment and deeply trust China's friends. China will continue to move forward, regardless of its fate." (2nd Associated Press dispatch)

### Iraq's Attitude Suddenly Changes; British-Iraqi Relations Tense; Iraq Opposes the Continued Dispatch of British Troops to Land; Troops Concentrated at Key Points for Defense

London: Authoritative sources here declared yesterday that the second batch of British troops had landed in Iraq despite protests from the Iraqi government. At the same time, the British Ambassador to Iraq, Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, demanded the immediate withdrawal of the large Iraqi army near the British air base of Habbaniya. Cornwallis said that the presence of the Iraqi army "may cause unfortunate incidents for which the Iraqi government should be fully responsible." The Iraqi government has protested to the British authorities, saying that no more troops can be dispatched to land until the first batch of British troops has left the country. In his reply, Cornwallis insisted that Britain had the right to fulfill the treaty under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. Authoritative sources revealed that the British troops' actions "are proceeding according to plan and the second batch of troops has arrived in Basra." It is learned that recently, when a riot occurred, Britain authorized Sir Kinahan Cornwallis to take appropriate steps to ensure the safety of British women and children in Iraq. (2nd Associated Press dispatch)

London: A Reuters diplomatic reporter has learned that London has received reports from Baghdad stating that some difficulties have arisen regarding the arrival of British troops in Iraq. Initially, when the British troops had not yet arrived in Basra, Iraq, the Iraqi government agreed to open the transportation lines through the country as stipulated in the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. Subsequently, Iraq received a notice from Britain informing them that the reinforcements to strengthen the British army would soon arrive in Iraq. They then said that the British troops already in Iraq had not yet left, and that the arrival of British troops could not be allowed to continue at this time. However, the British government was unwilling to abandon its treaty rights and therefore continued according to the pre-arranged plan, with the reinforcements landing in Basra without incident. However, some Iraqi troops are now concentrating, seemingly threatening the security of the British air base in Habbaniya, about 6,000 miles west of Basra. Therefore, the British are currently urging the Iraqi government to transfer its troops as soon as possible to avoid any unexpected incidents. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

London: A Reuters diplomatic reporter has learned that in the past few hours, a rather tense situation has developed in Iraq. The Iraqi authorities have gathered a large number of troops around the British airfield in Habbaniya, sixty miles west of Baghdad. The British government has pressured the Iraqi authorities to withdraw their troops, saying that if an accident occurs as a result, all responsibility will be borne by the Iraqi side. As of now, the Iraqi authorities do not seem to have adopted this approach, so the situation is quite critical. It is reported that British troops landed in Basra not long ago in accordance with the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, and subsequently more troops were sent to the area in accordance with the treaty, all without incident. At this point, the attitude of the Iraqi authorities suddenly changed, expressing dissatisfaction with the continued arrival of British troops. The British government is doing its best to maintain its treaty rights. According to the information currently received here, there have been no developments in other parts of Iraq. It is not yet known whether the British have demanded that the Iraqi troops withdraw by a deadline. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

Beirut: Britain's continued request to send troops to land in Basra has made British-Iraqi relations even more strained. The Iraqi government issued a communiqué yesterday afternoon stating that the Iraqi government has taken various steps to fulfill the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, allowing British troops to land in Basra and transit through Iraq. However, Britain has made requests that violate the treaty, and the Iraqi government has had to take necessary measures to protect various rights. The Iraqi people should remain calm and trust the government's measures. (2nd Haisong Society dispatch)

London: Britain yesterday quickly mustered its Middle East forces to protect the Mosul oilfields, as the second brigade of the British Expeditionary Force landed in Flurak despite protests from the Baghdad government. Authoritative sources in London learned that British people in Iraqi territory are establishing a strong supply base and improving various transportation lines in preparation for the war to spread to the country. It is said that after these transportation lines are improved, British troops can quickly rush to aid if Germany attacks Balikstan, Turkey, or even Syria. It is also said that British troops are patrolling the Mosul oil wells and refineries, and heavy troops have been added to protect the oil pipelines through Haifa that supply oil to the British Mediterranean Fleet. It is rumored that the evacuation of British people in Iraq is being prepared. The British troops who landed in Iraq on April 18 have all been deployed inland. This time, the Iraqi government expressed its opposition to the continued arrival of British troops in the country. The British accused the Iraqi government of violating the Anglo-Iraqi Mutual Assistance Treaty, which states that the Iraqi government should provide all kinds of facilities for the landing and transportation of British troops in Iraqi territory. (2nd International Society dispatch)

### Iraq's Ultimatum to Britain: Determination to Safeguard Sovereignty

Beirut: According to the treaty between Iraq and Britain, British troops were allowed to pass through Iraqi territory during wartime. However, after the British troops landed in Basra this time, they remained stationed in Iraq and did not move elsewhere. Despite repeated protests from the Iraqi government, these proved ineffective. Consequently, the Iraqi authorities have taken necessary measures to protect their national rights. On Saturday afternoon, the government notified the public of this matter and mobilized the special forces of the 1916 class and other classes. In the afternoon, three more troop transport ships arrived in Basra. Iraqi authorities prohibited their soldiers from landing and ordered the ship captains to immediately leave Iraqi territorial waters. According to semi-official sources in Baghdad, the Iraqi government has issued a final ultimatum to the British authorities, demanding that the three ships withdraw immediately and that the landed troops leave the country within two weeks. Otherwise, Iraq will use force to achieve this and declare the Iraqi-British treaty invalid. On Saturday night, Iraqi troops had occupied all military key points in the country, including the port of Basra. The oil fields were also placed under military protection. British nationals in Iraq have been relocated to the Habbaniyah airfield occupied by British troops. British Ambassador Cornwallis met with Iraqi Prime Minister Gailani several times on Saturday night and also received the Iraqi government's ultimatum. It is reported that the Iraqi Prime Minister told the British Ambassador that Iraq is determined to defend its national rights, even resorting to force if necessary, but this responsibility should be borne by Britain because Britain has already violated the treaty between the two countries.

### Partial Reorganization of the British Wartime Cabinet: Lord Beaverbrook Appointed as Minister of State

London: This morning, changes in government personnel were announced. Aircraft Production Minister Lord Beaverbrook has been appointed as Minister of State. His former position will be filled by Transport Minister Sir John Reith. The Aviation Minister, Captain Austin Hudson, has been appointed as Dominions Under-Secretary. The two departments of Aviation and Transport will be merged into one, and Mr. Leathers, the former coal advisor for the Ministry of Shipping, will be the minister of the new department. Some responsibilities of the Ministry of Transport that are not closely related to transportation will be transferred to the Board of Trade or other departments. (2nd Reuters)

London: Political figures recently stated that the changes in the British Cabinet have made Lord Beaverbrook an important assistant to the Prime Minister. Mr. Beaverbrook will now concentrate his efforts to assist Churchill. Mr. Beaverbrook's promotion and the establishment of the Ministry of War Transport indicate that British Prime Minister Churchill is determined, during the most critical period of the war, to devote every ounce of energy to the British war front. This cabinet change clearly aims to meet the demands of Parliament and the press for the establishment of a small war cabinet. The members of this war cabinet include Lord Beaverbrook, Lord Privy Seal Clement Attlee, Minister without Portfolio Arthur Greenwood, and Home Secretary Herbert Morrison. Informed sources also recognize Lord Beaverbrook as the "officer in command of the home front." (2nd Associated Press)

### Perilous International Situation: Red Army Prepares to Resist Aggression: Soviet Army Chief Issues May Day Proclamation: Will Deal a Head-on Blow to Any Invaders

Moscow: Marshal Timoshenko, People's Commissar of Defense of the Soviet Union, recently issued the following proclamation: "Today, the people of our motherland unanimously celebrate this May Day of labor, inspecting revolutionary forces. The great Soviet people are greeting this commemorative day with new socialist victories. Under the encouragement of the resolutions of the 18th Party Congress, the Soviet people continue to advance and have achieved great success in implementing the 1941 economic plan. The Red Army is the shield of the Soviet people's peaceful labor and also the guarantor of the victory of the October Revolution. The experience gained in recent years has further enhanced its strength. The Red Army is determined to inflict a devastating blow on anyone who dares to infringe upon the interests of the Soviet people and the socialist state. Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Belarus, and Northern Bukovina are celebrating Labor Day freely and joyfully for the first time this year. In the past year, these new Soviet republics have achieved great success. Currently, there are no landlords or capitalists in the new republics, and the working masses have established a new life. On the other hand, non-Soviet people are spending their Labor Day in a different environment. The Second Imperialist War has now spread to almost all capitalist countries and is evolving into a world war. The wars currently being waged in Europe, Asia, and Africa are being supported by resources from North and South America. War is being waged on land, sea, and air, causing great suffering and losses to the working masses. Our great motherland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, stands firm like a rock in a sea of storms. The Soviet people are benefiting from the wise diplomatic policies of Stalin, which have kept them out of the war. The Soviet government, in order to maintain friendly relations with its neighbors and other countries, recently signed a neutrality pact with Japan. This agreement is an important step in improving relations with Japan, and its political significance is self-evident. However, the achievements we have made in international policy and strengthening national defense do not mean that we can rest. The current international situation contains all kinds of alarming events. In this situation, the Red Army must be prepared for any eventuality and remain in a state of readiness, so that the enemy's 'accidents' and plots cannot succeed. (Stalin's words) The Soviet government, the Bolshevik Party, and Comrade Stalin have given us an important task, which is to reform the Red Army's training system in accordance with modern warfare experience. We should strive in this area so that the Red Army can repel any enemy at any time. Do not be complacent, do not be slack, and use modern warfare experience to further perfect our military knowledge. This is our daily instruction. The Soviet people have given the Red Army first-class technology. Our task is to advance in military science. At the same time, whether in practice or training, everything must closely resemble war. Red Army personnel, political personnel, and comrades, you should continue to improve military training, strengthen unified command and Soviet military discipline, and be ready at all times to defend the motherland. On this great commemorative day, I extend my congratulations to everyone and firmly believe that you will complete the tasks given to you by the government and Stalin." (2nd TASS)

Red Square: Grand Parade

Moscow: Yesterday, the sixteen Soviet republics enthusiastically celebrated May Day of Labor. The situation in Moscow was particularly active. Demonstrators gathered in the streets early in the morning, and music and bells rang out. Led by music bands, the demonstrators marched towards Red Square. Before one o'clock, Red Square was crowded with people, including members of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, members of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, Soviet heroes, writers, artists, and so on. In addition, representatives from the new Soviet republics participated for the first time. Special seats were occupied by the diplomatic corps and journalists. The Red Army troops were lined up in Red Square, a magnificent sight. At noon, leaders such as Stalin, Molotov, and Voroshilov ascended the podium, and the crowd greeted them with enthusiastic cheers. Then, Marshal Timoshenko, People's Commissar of Defense of the Soviet Union, rode out of the Kremlin and first listened to the report of the parade commander, Comrade Tyulenev, and then inspected the troops. Amid thunderous cheers, he took the stage to deliver a speech. At this point, the grand parade began. Leading the way were military school students, followed by a company of naval personnel, whose orderly steps were well-received. Members of the Soviet Defense Aviation and Chemical Society, including veteran Red Army soldiers, also participated in the parade. The infantry squads all carried new-style automatic rifles, leaving a deep impression on the viewers. This parade fully demonstrated the Red Army's great mechanized weapons. Motorcycles with machine guns and armored vehicles sped across Red Square. The variety of anti-aircraft weapons, such as anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns, was particularly noticeable. In addition, there were countless long-range cannons and tank-destroying guns. Following the artillery units were tank units, including new-style "land destroyers" and tank fortresses. At the same time, aircraft soared through the skies above Red Square. Some aircraft dove straight down at high speed, causing gasps of amazement. Bringing up the rear were the people's demonstration teams, who passed the command platform, winding endlessly for several hours, a magnificent sight. As they passed the reviewing stand, they unanimously cheered Stalin and his comrades. They also shouted slogans, supporting the Soviet government's peaceful foreign policy and expressing their determination to consolidate national defense and strengthen the Red Army. Many of the demonstrators were athletes and young people who had experienced hardship. In their slogans, they further demanded that the Soviet Union further develop its agricultural, cultural, and economic sectors. This great demonstration showed the Soviet people's loyalty and support for their beloved leader, Stalin. The demonstration involved two million people and lasted for five hours. (2nd TASS)

### Expansion of Axis Powers: Turkey Isolated: Turkish Defense Arrangements to be Greatly Modified: Papen Returns to Post: German-Turkish Situation Worth Watching

London: A Free French News Agency correspondent stationed in Istanbul reports that Turkey's defense arrangements have been greatly modified due to the occupation of some Aegean islands by German forces. Turkey's attention is now focused on the Smyrna region. It is believed that President Inönü will personally inspect the area to observe Germany's intentions. It seems that Germany intends to contact the Italian forces on the Dodecanese Islands in order to isolate Turkey and extend the influence of the Axis powers into Syria, while also avoiding the need for difficult military operations against Turkey. Germany's avoidance of the Dardanelles may avoid provoking the Soviet Union and will continue to benefit from Soviet economic assistance. The correspondent also believes that a large part of the German merchant fleet in the Black Sea, including eight large ships, will soon sail to the Aegean Sea to maintain supplies to the occupied islands.

Turkish Capital: German Ambassador to Turkey Franz von Papen is expected to arrive here by plane today. (2nd Coastal Telegraph)

Rome: According to reports, the Turkish government's attitude towards the current situation will be clarified after the German Ambassador to Turkey returns to his post. The evacuation of residents in Istanbul has been ordered to be suspended. (2nd Havas)

Istanbul: President Inönü secretly inspected defenses in various locations. After staying in southwestern Anatolia for several days, he has now arrived here and cruised the Dardanelles Strait in the yacht "Baverona." (1st Havas)

### This Year's Labor Day: Varied Celebrations in Different Countries: European Countries Affected by War: Celebrations Less Impressive Than in Previous Years

London: The celebration of Labor Day in most European countries has been greatly reduced due to the impact of the war. However, the Soviet Union is still celebrating for three days. A prominent feature of the Soviet celebration is the slogans praising Stalin's foreign policy, which they say contains international peace and domestic security. German workers are using this day as a memorial day for work and national unity. Marshal Pétain gave a speech to French workers, but in Brussels under German occupation, all commemorative parades in the streets were prohibited. (1st Reuters)

New York: Workers here held a May Day parade yesterday, but no accidents occurred. Special police were on high alert at the time, and the residences of all prominent industrial and financial leaders were guarded by military police. Participants in the parade included 29 groups from the Congress of Industrial Organizations and 15 groups from the American Federation of Labor. However, the majority of worker groups nationwide refused to participate in the parade, saying that the action was led by the Communist Party. (2nd Associated Press)

### Britain Denies Interference in Spain and Portugal: Claims it is German Propaganda

London: British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Richard Butler, stated in the House of Commons yesterday that rumors that Britain intends to interfere in Spain and Portugal are unfounded and are spread by German propaganda agencies, aimed at inciting anti-British sentiment among the people of Spain and Portugal and continuing Germany's plan to invade the Iberian Peninsula. The British government hopes that these German plans will be thwarted and that the people of Spain and Portugal will be spared the suffering of war. (2nd Reuters)

### Soviet Union Takes Extensive Steps to Strengthen Western Defenses: German Troops Land in Finland: Officially Confirmed by Finnish Authorities

New York: A New York Times dispatch from Bear Town says that the Soviet Union plans to take extensive steps to strengthen its already strong garrisons in Ukraine, Poland, and Estonia. It is rumored that the Soviet Union will dispatch 25 more divisions in addition to the 40 divisions originally stationed along the Dniester and Prut rivers. It is said that the Soviet Union has amassed a large amount of aviation materials in the area, prompting Germany to inquire about the reasons from Moscow. It is said that the Soviet Union has replied that these aircraft are for sowing wheat this spring. (1st Reuters)

Moscow: Yesterday, it was announced that Major General Kononov has been appointed Commander of the Special Military District of the Baltic. Also, Major General Smushkevich, former Commander of the Far East, was seen in Red Square today wearing a general's uniform, indicating that he has been promoted. The current Commander of the Far East is General Apanasenko. (2nd Associated Press)

Moscow: The Soviet Union concentrated dozens of squadrons of aircraft, cannons, and tanks here yesterday in preparation for today's annual May Day performance. This happened at the same time as news of German troops landing in Finland. Recently, the "Red Army News" published a commentary stating, "The international situation is extremely complex and changes rapidly, but no matter how dangerous the storms around us, our country's ship will continue to follow its course." Also, former Finnish Communist leader Antti Kainen wrote in "Pravda" that "Capitalist countries, national hatred, patriotism, and militaristic thinking are spreading beyond our borders." At the same time, a Tairin Aikyo telegram published in "Pravda" here stated that German troops landed at the port of Abo in Finland on April 26 on four transport ships and sailed to Tampere on the 28th. (1st Associated Press)

London: Today, the Finnish Embassy here issued an official statement confirming the news of German troops arriving in Finland, but said that the reported number of 12,000 was an exaggeration. These few German troops are traveling to Norway in accordance with the transit arrangements agreed upon last autumn. (1st Reuters)

Washington: The Finnish Consul General in the United States declared that rumors of 11,000 German troops landing in Finland are untrue. Only 1,300 German soldiers have arrived in Finland, and they are all unarmed. There is nothing wrong with the transit agreement signed between Germany and Finland last year. (1st Coastal Telegraph)

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that London has no knowledge of reports that German troop transport ships have landed German troops at the port of Turku (Abo) in southwestern Finland. However, Germany may have an agreement with the Finnish government allowing German troops to transit through Finland to Petsamo and northern Norway. The British government considered this agreement unfortunate and made strong representations to the Finnish government. The agreement also allows German soldiers on leave in Germany to return to their units in northern Norway via Finland. In recent months, perhaps due to bad weather, ice, and snow in northern Finland, Norway, and the Gulf of Bothnia, many German soldiers on leave have been unable to return north to their units. Now that spring has arrived and the weather has improved, the movement of German soldiers on leave may have intensified, so there may continue to be news of German troops passing through Finland in the coming weeks. It is believed that the Finnish-German agreement allows "workers" and German soldiers on leave to transit through Finland. (1st Reuters)

### Chief of General Staff of Italian Forces in North Africa Killed in Bombing

Rome: According to an announcement here last night, Major General Gualtiero, Chief of General Staff of the Italian forces in North Africa, was killed in a British air raid on Tripoli. (2nd Coastal Telegraph)

### British Troops Complete Retreat from Greece: Approximately 45,000: Germany Claims to Have Captured 8,000 British Troops

London: The news that British troops have completed their retreat from Greece has been confirmed here. According to estimates by responsible experts, the number of troops withdrawn is between 41,000 and 45,000. (2nd Reuters)

London: Official sources in Cairo recently announced that eight out of ten of the British Empire troops originally in Greece have been safely evacuated. Yesterday, Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons that at least three-quarters of the British troops in Greece had withdrawn, with heavy equipment being abandoned. Up until the time of the inevitable withdrawal, the British had dispatched about 60,000 troops to land in Greece, including one division each from New Zealand and Australia. At least 45,000 of them have been evacuated (cheers). The British Air Force was forced to leave its airfields in Greece due to enemy superiority, leaving only a small number of aircraft to cover the British troops boarding ships. From this point of view, the successful withdrawal of the majority of British troops must be regarded as an outstanding achievement. The British troops fought and retreated, and their achievement in reaching the coast after a long journey should be highly praised, especially the rearguard units. German aircraft bombed continuously every day, but failed to break the discipline and order of the British troops on the march. In addition to being attacked from the air, the British troops were also pursued by three German armored divisions and the entire mechanized army. The British troops suffered about 2,000 casualties in several major battles around Mount Olympus, Grevena, and the Tempe Pass. This is negligible compared to the losses suffered by the German troops. The German troops, with five times the strength, were repeatedly blocked and stopped by the British troops. There was a stalemate for two days at one point. The German troops also suffered considerable losses when attacking the Greek and ANZAC troops. I dare to say that I will be able to give a more detailed report during the debate next week.

### Axis Forces Besiege Tobruk

Cairo: According to the latest communiqué, a large enemy infantry force, aided by several tanks, attacked Tobruk last night and invaded its outer defenses this morning. Details are unknown, and the battle is still ongoing. (1st Reuters)

Cairo: The attackers of Tobruk appear to be Italian troops and tanks. According to a military spokesman, there is no evidence of German participation. (2nd Reuters)

Cairo: A British military spokesman here announced last night that the Axis countries on the Egyptian border will attempt a slight advance. The Axis forces are now arrayed below the "Hellfire Pass," with another force protecting the flanks of the pass. There are also enemy troops in the Sollum area. This force is small in number, but reinforcements are being sent. The enemy reinforcements may be transported to a location near Tunis and then sail along French territorial waters to land in Tripoli. (1st Reuters)

### Speaking Up for the Axis Powers: Revealing the Conditions for Peace; The Mediterranean and Africa to be Dominated by Germany and Italy, Japan Also Sees Itself as the Leader of the Far East Alliance

Tokyo: The Japan Times and Hirochishinbun both attempted yesterday to formulate possible conditions for peace in the European war. However, they admitted that they were unaware of the key points of the Axis powers' solution. The preamble stated that the current European situation seems to be at a turning point in the European war, and the general public has begun to wonder if it cannot end here and now. The following conditions for peace are then proposed: The first principle is that the greatest opportunity for the development and disposition of the world, such as spheres of influence, resources, and political systems, should be enjoyed by the stronger countries. Detailed requirements that are possible according to this principle must be considered before they can be considered. The power to resolve peaceful trends should be wielded by the following countries: Germany (with Italy as a second-tier partner), Japan, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Military factors must first be explored in a broad sense. Britain and the United States should declare a "naval holiday" on the high seas. The Axis powers will do the same when they reach a considerable ratio. Malta in the eastern Mediterranean and the Aden fortress in the Red Sea will be dismantled and become demilitarized zones. The same applies to Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United States' bases in the Pacific, as well as any plans for the Aleutian Islands (North America West) opposite Japan. British naval forces in the Mediterranean will be completely withdrawn. The Axis powers will demand that the Suez Canal be jointly managed and defended by Britain and the Axis powers. All of North Africa, from Gibraltar to Somaliland, will be disposed of by the Axis powers. The Axis powers may allow France to retain its colonies under certain common conditions. Some British colonies and other African colonies on the east and west coasts will be administered by Germany and Italy. The Union of South Africa may secede from its mother country and become completely independent. All commercial preferential tariffs should be abolished. The entire European continent will form a federation, with all states under German control. All political cooperation will be based in Berlin. Britain will remain the center of the British Empire, but the people of the Empire may gradually recognize the need to transfer various powers to Canada, so that it can be more secure and become an overseas base. Where Germany's power will end in the southeast is a question. Unless the Sea of Marmara is handed over to Turkey and the Soviet Union for joint management, Germany may take the sea as its border. The oil wells of Iraq and Iran are subject to equal access by all countries, and a joint ownership system should be established by the current investors, representatives of the sovereign states, and Germany. This is an inevitable requirement. The United States will take Canada, Central America, South America, Newfoundland, Greenland, and the surrounding islands as its sphere of influence, but the United States will be responsible for not dominating South America in a way that hinders the Axis powers. Germany and its allies must be allowed to enjoy full freedom and equal opportunities on the continent. The United States must not establish naval bases west of Hawaii, and even reducing the importance of fortresses may be a condition. As for the entire Pacific, the Dutch East Indies may have to secede and be governed by an independent government. Indigenous people have equal political rights. The territories of the British Isles and peninsulas will increase their autonomy. All islands in the Pacific will hire Japanese advisers and entrust them with the responsibility of making the cooperation method in this co-prosperity sphere a reality. In particular, to preserve the natural resources needed in the Pacific region, French Indochina will also be allowed to become independent as part of the overall plan for concord politics in the West Pacific region. The Soviet Union may have to abolish its military defenses in Siberia and eliminate the threat from Vladivostok to reassure Japan and as a gesture of trust. Japan will reduce its garrison in Manchuria or Mongolia to the number needed to protect the safety of Japan's sphere of influence in return. Australia will abolish the discriminatory immigration system and allow Japanese people to have equal residency rights. The future of India will be the establishment of an autonomous government under a plan that improves the legal system of the British government and is co-desired by the indigenous people.

London: British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, said in a speech at the Imperial Association that the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Treaty was "(a worthless scrap of paper)."

### The Second New Huan Primary School Also Went on Strike Yesterday, Demanding Improved Treatment and Job Security; The School Responded That Three Items Could Not Be Satisfied

Teachers and staff of the private Second New Huan Primary School on Chongqing Road, Weihaiwei Road in this city went on strike yesterday because their request to the school to improve their treatment and issue employment contracts for the next semester in advance was not granted.

The school also sent letters to the parents of each student, asking them to instruct the students not to go to school for the time being. According to a Guanghua News Agency reporter, the teachers' demands totaled three items: (1) Each teacher and staff member should receive a monthly allowance of 60 yuan, and the previous three months should be paid retroactively; (2) Salaries for each semester should be calculated based on six months; (3) Employment contracts for each teacher and staff member must be issued one month before the end of the semester, and no arbitrary transfers are allowed.

### Grain: Buying A Sheng Of Rice Will Cost $1.56, How Will The Masses Survive? This Is A Heinous And Conscientious Act By Rice Merchants. Let Us See How Far This Horizontal Inflation And Vertical Price Hike Will Go. Fortunately, The Shanghai Municipal Council's Fixed Rice And Saigon Rice Are About To Arrive.

The price of foreign rice is rising more and more fiercely, the selling price is almost rising every day, every hour, and every moment. The greed of the hoarders has not yet ended, and the lives of 85% of food households are in despair. The rise is out of control. The day before yesterday (May 1), all foreign rice rose sharply. No. 1 Saigon arrived at $154, No. 2 reached $148, Yinghua Division (one stone and two dou and a half), No. 1 reached $174, and original package broken rice also reached $140.05, which is $3, $5, or $6 more than the closing price on April 30. Moreover, rumors abounded to cheer on the hoarders, and the market was almost created into a terrifying situation of rising prices all the way. Yesterday, the market area was divided into three parts: one is the place where merchants and shops buy, one is the place where original vendors sell, and in the middle of the two parts is the place where brokers mediate. In this way, original vendors can only sell to rice distributors, and rice distributors can only sell to shops. All transactions must be registered in a book by the broker at the registration office, such as which customer sells to which line, which line sells to which shop, each is clearly distinguished. In this way, in addition to actual sales, it seems that there is no possibility of confusion. However, it is not yet certain whether it can be brought into the right track. At the same time, members of the Broker Association enter the arena in batches, alternating every other day, in order to reduce unnecessary buying. The business hours are stipulated from 10:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. The market was closed yesterday under this regulation. Since the market opened at 10:00 a.m., shop customers were already extremely crowded, and they were competing with each other to apply to rice distributors, and the rice distributors purchased from original vendors. For a time, the sales market was lively, and the selling voices rose one after another. If the foreign rice increased by one yuan from the initial opening, No. 1 Saigon opened at $155, and small pressed opened at $146.5. Afterwards, the buying interest became more and more旺盛，市面再接再厲，接續上升，　收盤各色洋米行情較前繼漲二元左右，計一號西貢爲百五　十元，二號百五十一二元，敏黨百五十一二元，三號還羅百五十六元，小絞百四十八元，東京砶尖百四十元左右，碎尖百廿二三元，

### Kan Flour Opens At $35, The Flat-Selling Flour Is Changed To $29

Flour: The current foreign flour market situation, since the Hua factory flat-selling flour was changed to a wholesale price of $29 from May 1, and then followed by the rising prices of rice, oil, and various miscellaneous grains, everyone's heart is upward. Speculators and hoarders, using rumors of currency system changes as an excuse, greatly raised prices, causing the market to rise sharply. The day before yesterday, Jinlong brand Kan flour once reached $35, which was an unprecedented record. Yesterday morning, the market opened, and the buying interest was still strong. Jinlong flour opened at $34.2 to $2.5 jiao. Then, due to profit-taking by hoarders midway, the market fell slightly, and the price returned to $34.1 and $34. The price of Huaniao brand Australian flour was $34.3 to $4 jiao, and the late market also fell back by one or two jiao. A total of 35,000 to 6,000 bags were traded in the market. Hua factory continued to supply flat-selling flour, limited to 300,000 bags. More than 5,000 bags were wholesaled by Fuxin every day, and the wholesale price was changed to $29 plus miscellaneous fees of 5 jiao, which was $4 higher than the previous price.

Wheat: Wheat is extremely tight. Because the price of flour has soared, sellers are more and more reluctant to sell. It is reported that the price of high-gluten wheat in the concession warehouse must be $51 or $2. The factory door-to-door price has also been released to $47 or $8, but there is still no spot available for collection. The market is still stagnant.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Beans And Corn Are Constantly Being Collected

Yesterday, the yellow bean market was under the violent rise of oil cake, which caused hoarders to absorb them. Therefore, the Guīdé bean market price has opened to the highest price of $48, and 1,400 to 500 bags were traded (others were not announced). Corn sales are good in Zhejiang because there is Lianyungang, so people's hearts have turned for the better, and the market price has risen steadily. Although there were ups and downs in the middle, the result still rose by more than one yuan. It is estimated that Xīgòng Chen bought 36.5 yuan to 39 yuan, then to 8.5 yuan, then to 9 yuan, and finally closed at 8 yuan. New goods rose directly from 40 yuan to 42 yuan, and closed at 41 yuan. Spot Yinghua division was 75 yuan, and Dutch white corn rose from 39.5 yuan to 42 yuan, and the result closed at 41 yuan. Futures for April were 74 yuan to 75 yuan, and closed at 4.5 yuan. March to April 交 为 75 元, April-May 交 为 74 元, A total of 4500-600 bags of spot and 600 tons of futures were traded. 1520 bags of beans were shipped to Singapore in three days.

### Oil Cake: Bean Cake Is Raised To A High Price, And It Is Used To Realize Profits

The bean cake market, because of the violent rise the day before yesterday (1st) (the side oil soared by 8 or 9 yuan, and the bean cake soared by about 2 yuan), caused speculators to see that there was already a thick profit to be made, which aroused the desire to close out, so they took the opportunity to come out, and business was lively. Shēngjì cake market price was shouted lower and lower (the cake factory is nearby, and the factory also has chips to release), so speculators thought that the good result was about one yuan lower than the market the previous day (1st). Although other cakes were affected, the overall situation was stable. A total of more than 20,000 pieces of Shēngjì cake were traded, and the price details are in the market price column, 1,000 pieces of green character cake, 5 vehicles of fat character cake, and 2 vehicles of Yuanlong cake. After the bean oil soared the day before yesterday, it was calm yesterday. In short, the value is too high, the sales market is also small, so if there is no speculation, the trend should be slightly frustrated. Yesterday, Dalian oil was still one day's original plate, the price was 186 yuan, and 200 barrels were traded. 200 dan of Dayou factory oil, the price was 134 yuan old warehouse receipt.

### Finance  American Exchange Rates More Active

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed exchange rates unchanged.  The black market for British exchange rates was steady but slightly looser.  The US dollar seemed more active and slightly tightened. After opening in the morning, it softened slightly due to outflows from Dao Heng Bank and Hong Kong Electric. However, the Bank of England and HSBC suddenly absorbed funds, bringing the US dollar back to its initial level of $5.15625.  It softened again to $5.125.  At noon, some brokers and importers made small purchases, while American merchants and other institutions offered to sell, halting the tightening and returning the rate to its initial level. In the afternoon, speculators suddenly came in to hedge, with the Bank of England and HSBC showing strong absorption capacity.  The US dollar softened to close at $5.115, tightening to $0.03125. The British exchange rate, due to outflows from Hong Kong Electric, trended flat at 3 pence and 1875.

British Currency Remains Stable

In the afternoon, Hong Kong Electric strongly sold British currency, but because banks absorbed less, it was difficult to continue selling after 3 pence and 1875. At that time, speculators hedged May US dollars at $5.15625, and HSBC and others absorbed them, leading to a slight softening.  The four o'clock closing saw spot and May/June futures for British currency at 2 pence and 1875, and the US dollar at $5.125.

Everyone focused on the trends in US exchange rates, with tightening or loosening serving as the turning point, generally agreeing that $5.125 was a key level. The market opened at $6,755 due to buying pressure, but foreign exchange outflows from Hong Kong Electric caused rates to return to flat, leading to selling pressure from both securities firms and gold dealers, and prices fell back down. In the afternoon, the market opened at a low of $6,715 in a selling environment. Remittance merchants bought at the low price, and Xinyuan made strong purchases.

Yesterday, prices remained weak and lackluster, and trading became increasingly sluggish. Most participants were on the sidelines. Although Tongkang engaged in some trading, it was hesitant, buying and selling intermittently. Xiekang, Lianyi, and Dahua had some interest in buying, but were unable to raise market prices.

### Yarn and Cotton The Double Horse That Rose for a Week Approaching 100 Yuan

The yarn market, which turned lower in the afternoon of the previous day, rose again yesterday, with the upward trend still strong. This was because demand from Hong Kong merchants remained strong. Speculators believed that the number of Double Horse chips would be reduced, and the old story of labor reduction due to electricity conservation was brought up again. As a result, they uniformly bought up factory orders, engaging in manipulation. The market gradually rose. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn yesterday was $1,577, and the low price was $1,548. The initial transaction price in the afternoon was $1,568, which later rose to $1,576. There was profit-taking in the middle, and prices loosened to $1,565, but short covering was good, and the final price was $1,574.5. Double Horse yarn has risen from a low of $1,479 last Friday (the 25th of last month) to a high of $1,577 yesterday, rising for a week and climbing close to $100. Cotton yarn was also not limited to exports for the past two days.

The opening situation for Double Horse in the morning showed that prices had turned weak compared to the evening of the previous day, and market sentiment was mixed. The initial price was $1,550, falling slightly to $48 shortly thereafter. At this time, buying pressure rose sharply, with only buyers and few sellers. In an instant, prices rose to $1,561, but some speculative buyers exited, and standard gold remained flat. The market stabilized for a long time. It was then heard that the trading of Guangbang coarse yarn was not bad, and miscellaneous brand yarns were also relatively firm. Prices tightened suddenly, with more buyers than sellers, rising directly to $1,577. Those who profited in the middle exited, falling back to $1,568 at closing.

Hong Kong 1,100  Inland 50

### Yarn Prices Rise Sharply Cotton Market Turns for the Better 16,000 Bales of American Cotton Arrive

The current cotton situation turned for the better following the yarn market, but the excitement was not as strong as the firmness of the yarn market.

Fire cotton bag 197 Tongchang 200 bales Also

Another report: Foreign cotton trading by foreign firms in Shanghai continued to rise firmly due to high sentiment and enthusiastic buying. Considering the lack of shipping costs from overseas procurement, and at the same time, the prosperous situation of spot yarn in the city, factory and counterparts purchases have been very enthusiastic in recent days. In addition to Indian and Brazilian cotton, there were also small amounts of California and Egyptian cotton transactions yesterday. The Xinnuo Yarn Factory has purchased a large quantity of Argentine cotton, with a market price of around 300 yuan.

A large batch of American cotton arrived in Shanghai. The American liner "City of Alam", managed by Wallen Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai from Santos, Brazil, South America, with a large batch of 16,010 pieces of cotton on the previous day (the 1st). It docked at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong to unload.

New York cotton cloth rose firmly due to purchases by counterparts and short covering. Closing prices rose by one to twelve points compared to the previous day. Prices rose fourteen to one point above the previous day (the 2nd).

The Indian cotton market rose initially due to buyer covering, and then fell slightly due to selling by various parties, profit-taking by longs, and the impact of the international situation. As a result, closing prices rose by about two rupees. Forecasts predict that today's closing market will be half a rupee higher.

### Piece Goods Purchasing Cocoons Towards the Occupied Areas Coarse Cloth Sales Are Booming

Transactions in the street saw over 300 bales of light-weight coarse cloth of 9 and 11 pounds being purchased by wholesale shops for use as cocoon bags, as many unscrupulous merchants were preparing to purchase cocoons from Zhejiang Province. Dyeing factories purchased over 200 pieces of twill grey cloth. Counterparts made internal transactions of seven to eight hundred pieces. Zhejiang merchants purchased over one hundred pieces of coarse and fine cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants purchased three hundred pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, etc. Yunnan merchants purchased fifty pieces of Shilin cloth, etc. Overseas merchants purchased five to six thousand pieces of bleached and dyed cloth from Chichi and other places.

### North-South Goods  Orchid Bamboo Branches Recover

Due to the recent lack of new arrivals and limited inventory, the market for orchid bamboo branches has recovered. The market has been firm in recent days, rising by over ten yuan compared to before. However, black leaf branches did not meet demand and remained unchanged. Small amounts of ordinary goods opened, but prices loosened.

### Seafood Squid Sources Are Quite Plentiful

Although squid sales are not bad, sources are quite plentiful, and inventory is increasing daily. The market is flat. New goods are currently sold for $245, while old goods are discounted by ten yuan, to $235. It seems difficult to improve for the time being.

Dried scallops are active in both arrival and sales. However, the market price has risen again due to exchange rate fluctuations. Current prices are $707 for large-sized goods and $686 for the next-sized.

### Procuring Foreign Rice to Supply the People's Food Two Concessions Implement Simultaneously Citizens' Lives May Become More Stable in the Future Companies and Businesses Should Assist in This Effort The First Batch of Fixed Rice Will Arrive This Month Bread and Bun Industry First to Order

According to a statement issued by the Public Works Department, the Bureau is currently in the final stages of negotiations with the Hong Kong Government and will soon have 5,000 tons of Aung San small grain rice shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai for sale. This can be done in conjunction with shipping 20,000 to 25,000 tons of rice to Shanghai per month for adjustment purposes. Regarding Hong Kong rice export licenses, except for orders that have already obtained this certificate and that the order does not exceed 2,900 tons, the Hong Kong Government will not issue licenses to ship rice from Hong Kong to Shanghai other than those issued to the Bureau.

Hong Kong Rice Prices Have Been Determined The Bureau has previously stated that it has decided to sell the rice shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai to the public at a reasonable price, and that it does not intend to interfere with the normal rice industry unless necessary, hoping that wholesale and retail rice merchants will cooperate in the distribution of the above-mentioned rice. Regarding the above-mentioned 5,000 tons of grain in the first batch, the Bureau is currently preparing to handle customer order registration procedures. Relevant wholesale and retail rice merchants can contact the Likee Foreign Firm at 210 Sichuan Road for details on prices and distribution conditions. The tentative maximum retail price for the first batch of rice is $110 per picul.

French Concession Takes the Same Approach The French Concession Municipal Council issued a public notice yesterday morning stating that the French Concession authorities have also taken the same approach as the Public Concession Public Works Department, purchasing foreign rice from Vietnam. The first batch will arrive in Shanghai within the next week and will be directly distributed to various retail rice shops for sale to suppress rice prices in the Shanghai market. According to key officials of the French Concession, the authorities' implementation of this direct purchase and transportation method is the only effective solution to eliminate rice smugglers and unscrupulous merchants, and Shanghai's current unstable situation will also be improved. It is reported that the bread and bun industry association in this city has first requested the Public Works Department to allocate more than 400 piculs of Hong Kong rice per month to benefit the industry.

Companies and Businesses Should Quickly Place Orders The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated that the French Concession authorities disclosed this morning (the 2nd) that they have now adopted the same method of shipping rice to the city as announced by the Public Works Department yesterday (the 1st). Rice merchants manipulating the rice market have now adopted a defensive posture. Rice for the Public Concession will be shipped from Hong Kong in mid-month, and the French Concession authorities stated that large quantities of rice will be shipped from Vietnam to Shanghai starting next week. It is estimated that Shanghai's major rice merchants are currently hoarding about 1.6 million bags of rice to manipulate the market, causing rice prices to skyrocket. However, the new actions taken by the two bureaus today are expected to prevent manipulators from using their skills. Well-informed sources claimed this morning that the situation could be greatly improved if businesses here, especially public utility companies, were to support the new plan of the Public Concession authorities. Because the public utility companies purchase rice from the Public Works Department on behalf of their employees, the benefits are significant. The resulting impact will cause rice prices to fall. At the same time, the various chambers of commerce in this city should cooperate to ensure the smooth sale of the rice that is shipped in.

Rice Market Forced to Automatically Rectify The Rice Market Management Committee convened its 81st committee meeting the day before yesterday, and unanimously advocated revitalizing the rice market's trading regulations. After deliberation, it was decided to take emergency measures and shorten the market's operating hours. It has been implemented since yesterday. A verification point was set up at the market entrance to check the market access permits of the firms and customers. Monitoring and impartial offices were set up in the market, and the market was divided into north and south sides, namely the buying and selling parties. The area in the market was about three to five feet wide for rice brokers and monitors to stand. The "impartial office" was set up on the stage at the west end of the market. After a rice transaction was officially completed under monitoring, the broker had to take the transaction order around to the impartial office to request a stamp before it could be considered an official transaction, otherwise it would be considered an illegal transaction. Subsequently, any disputes that arise will be refused arbitration.

Rice Prices Rise Again Rectification Ineffective

It also stipulates: (1) Brokers are only allowed to sell to counterparts operating in the market for intermediary business on behalf of customers. (2) Re-sellers are only allowed to sell to rice distributors operating in the market for intermediary business on behalf of customers. (3) Rice purchased by rice shops should be purchased from rice distributors operating in the market, and a transaction order must be issued at the time of transaction. After implementing the above-mentioned measures yesterday, the market opened at 10:30, and it was initially quiet. However, in a short time, rumors spread again that Hong Kong had banned rice exports, and prices rose sharply, with the highest price exceeding the $160 per picul mark. On the broker side, the number of people entering the market has been reduced to 30 per day since yesterday to avoid criticism from foreign parties.

Rice Ships Chartered According to yesterday's news, the Public Works Department Public Warehouse Management Committee has chartered two ships, one named "Gran" and one named "North Trader." The former sailed south a few days ago and will load about 2,500 tons of rice from Yangon next month to ship to Shanghai. The latter is already in Yangon and will load about 4,000 tons of white rice to ship to Shanghai at the end of May. Also

Flour Arrives The Loganbell ship, registered in the United States, arrived yesterday, carrying 400,000 bags of American flour. Another ship, the American Star, also registered in the United States, will ship 250,000 bags of flour from the United States to Shanghai at the beginning of next week. It is reported that the ship set sail from Seattle at the beginning of last month.

### US Export Permit Measures Affect Industry

According to the Public Works Department's Industrial and Social Affairs April report last month, although the yarn industry was active because the coastal ports of Zhejiang were closed, this was because of the strong demand for cotton products in the interior. At the same time, speculators are again engaged in purchases. The price of high-quality cotton yarn has risen due to the possibility of the source of Egyptian cotton being blocked. The work of several dyeing factories has decreased, and the delivery of goods from cigarette factories has not been busy. Only one-third of the light bulb factories are operating, and business is poor. Only one silk factory is operating, but the work situation of silk weaving factories is the same as that of wool weaving factories. Factories manufacturing enamelware have reduced their output by one-third. Machine factories have difficulty obtaining raw materials such as pig iron, iron sheets, and copper. The Customs has not yet seen how the measures to manage the transportation of certain goods from this city to the southern market will affect the situation, but the US regulations on export permits have caused difficulties for several industries.

### Tongren Fuyuan Hall Appeals for Donations Due to Surging Costs of Coffins and Materials, Experiencing Extreme Financial Difficulties

Shanghai Tongren Fuyuan Hall, the oldest charity in Shanghai, was founded during the reign of Emperor Xianfeng of the Qing Dynasty. Located in Meijialong, Qiaojia Bang in the Nanshi district, its charitable activities include providing monthly rations to the poor, orphans, the elderly, and widows, as well as dispensing medicine in the summer, distributing clothing and rice in the winter, and providing burial grounds.

Providing Coffins and Burial Services for the Deceased Found on the Streets, Unclaimed Corpses, and Abandoned Coffins in the Wilderness. A branch hall is established on Ningbo Road in the French Concession to provide coffins and burial services for the deceased found on the streets within the concession. A rescue bureau is set up at the South Wharf, equipped with rescue patrol boats to rescue people who fall into the river and recover drowned bodies. Those without relatives to claim them are also provided with coffins and burial. Their burial grounds are located in Liuliqiao, Beicai in Pudong, and Tangwan Township in Puxi. The expenses for the above-mentioned charitable activities

Amount to Nine Thousand Several Thousand Yuan Annually. After the war, the hall was destroyed, and most of its properties were damaged by fire. Only a few remain, which need to be extensively repaired. The limited rental income is insufficient to cover the costs of repairs. Since last spring, prices have soared, and the hall's charitable expenses have also increased dramatically. It is said that the cost of coffins alone has increased from just four yuan and several jiao per piece before the war to over thirty yuan now. The French Concession and the southern and western parts of Shanghai need an average of about thirty to forty coffins of various sizes daily, costing over one thousand yuan per day, or over twenty thousand yuan per month. Other transportation and burial costs are not included. If this continues, it will be difficult to sustain. It is hoped that benevolent gentlemen from all walks of life will generously contribute to this charitable cause, which will be immeasurably meritorious.

### London Stops Listing Shanghai-Hong Kong Marine Insurance Rates Due to Increasing Crisis in the Pacific Trade Circles Pay Close Attention

According to reports from Shanghai, the London marine insurance industry, in view of the increasing risks in the Pacific region, has recently stopped publishing marine insurance rates for Shanghai and Hong Kong. This news has attracted considerable attention from trade circles in Shanghai. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the Shanghai Marine Insurance Association at No. 18 Huangpu Tan Road. The person in charge stated that the company

Was unaware of this news.

However, insurance agency firms stated that this news is indeed true. Insurance circles in Shanghai indicated that the reason why the London insurance industry refuses to publish marine insurance rates for Shanghai and Hong Kong is probably because the London insurance industry is paying close attention to the situation in the Far East and wants the marine insurance industry in Shanghai and Hong Kong to freely set prices at what they consider appropriate, without being affected by the prices published by London. It was also stated that war insurance prices are not affected by the new regulations set by London, and local firms will continue to follow the local prices published by London

As a standard.

It is understood that local firms currently charge an average of 1.50 yuan per thousand yuan worth of goods for marine insurance. However, import and export merchants claim that they often pay more than 2.50 yuan per thousand yuan worth of goods, sometimes as much as 6, 7, or 9 yuan, which is said to be due to various surcharges. The war insurance fee published in London is still 5 yuan per thousand yuan worth of goods, which local firms continue to follow. The marine insurance rates in Shanghai are not higher than those published in London, but the trade community fears that the prices of imported goods will rise due to the increase in insurance costs.

### Turning Point in Labor Strike

The Commercial Press to Issue Salaries on a Fixed Date

In addition to stating the hardships and reasonable demands of the colleagues, the labor representatives also mentioned the issue of salary payment on the 3rd. They firmly requested Mr. Li to provide a sincere explanation of the attitude of General Manager Wang and the principles for resolving the labor strike, in order to comfort the colleagues. Mr. Li said that he was sent to Shanghai by the General Manager to resolve the labor strike. The factory has decided to issue salaries at the General Management Office on Henan Road on the morning of the 5th of this month. The general branch will issue salaries in the afternoon. As for the various demands, they still need to be decided by the board of directors. Negotiations will be held again in a day or two. If mutual understanding can be reached, there is hope of breaking the deadlock in the labor strike.

The Labor Strike at Fuxin Tobacco Company Resolved

The labor strike at the Fuxin Tobacco Company on Macau Road has lasted for more than ten days due to disagreements over rice subsidies during the work stoppage. It is now learned that the labor strike has been resolved satisfactorily after further negotiations between the two parties. Male workers will receive an increase of 4 to 6 yuan (calculated monthly), while female workers will receive an increase of 3 to 6 li (calculated per pack of cigarettes, the original wage was 9 fen and 7 li 5). In addition to a daily rice subsidy of 2 jiao, 2 dou of white rice will be provided monthly. During the work stoppage, the factory will provide a monthly subsidy of 15 yuan for male workers, in addition to the original subsidy, and 1 dou of white rice for female workers.

It is expected to be implemented starting this month.

### Post Office Recruits Letter Carriers Physical Examinations Completed

Those who pass the written examination will be scheduled for a bicycle test and an oral examination.

### Exports of Four Types of Native Products Exceed 100 Million in the First Quarter

After the government trade authorities designated the four categories of native products—tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals—to assess production, sales, and international market prices and then統籌purchase and sell them at preferential prices, the Trade Commission, China Tea Company, Fuxing Company, and Resources Commission were ordered to統籌purchase and sell them and export them to the Soviet Union and other countries via the Sino-Soviet Highway, the Burma Road, and Hong Kong. Because these four types of native products are related to barter trade and debt repayment, the export quantities and values for the first quarter of this year are recorded below: (1) Tung oil: 81,995 quintals, 23,864,577 yuan, compared to 50,210 quintals and 7,38,724 yuan in the same quarter last year.

The Company States That Expenses Have Increased Sharply

At the annual shareholders' meeting of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, Chairman Meige explained to the shareholders that the company's income is insufficient to meet the daily increasing expenses or replace new vehicles. Last year, the company's difficulties were not only due to sharply increased expenses, but also due to the loss of 203,000 yuan in income due to labor strikes. At times, the public buses were prohibited from driving on the roads outside the Shanghai western boundaries. As for the workers' strike, there was no reason for it. The company's policy is to maintain wages at a level sufficient to cover living expenses and to do its best to improve the general labor conditions as the economic situation permits. Meige stated at the end that last year the company added two new public buses, and the bodies of 18 new buses purchased the year before had been assembled. In addition, six smaller public buses were retired last year.

### People Have a Starved Look

— Pan Li

After Germany launched a large-scale war in Europe, sociologists predicted that the European continent would face an unprecedented great famine. Not long ago, the famous French scientist Carrel returned to Europe from the United States to investigate the extent of the famine in the occupied areas of France, hoping to use scientific methods to ensure that the people get adequate nutrition. It can be seen that the food problem in Europe is serious.

The famines and food robbing cases that we see before us make the people's food problem self-evident.

At present, the richest region is often considered to be the Americas in the Western Hemisphere. But strangely, the people's food in the United States is also said to be problematic. Four years ago, in his second inaugural address, US President Roosevelt mentioned that "one-third of the nation is undernourished." According to recent surveys, this is not an exaggeration. In the United States, four out of ten families do not have enough to eat. Based on this estimate, 13 million families in the so-called Golden State of the United States do not have enough to eat. The food situation in other countries can also be imagined.

Those who are struggling on the verge of starvation should understand that these phenomena are man-made. Only with human efforts can these phenomena be corrected.

### After Marriage

— Bing Hong

After marriage, although my work is still almost the same as before, my life has undergone great changes.

In the early morning, waking up from a dream, I reach for the watch beside my pillow, and force open my tight eyes. Seeing that it's only half-past six, I still have enough time to finish my morning routine and prepare breakfast in the kitchen. I can no longer bury myself in bed like when I lived at school, sitting up and lying down, lying down and sitting up, waiting for the congee to arrive before "officially" getting up. Now? It's like escaping a disaster. It's okay when the weather is clear, I just swallow the congee and leave. If it rains, it's terrible. Wearing galoshes, carrying an umbrella, and holding a bundle of cotton shoes, I drape a bulky coat over myself and rush to the tram stop on the muddy road, often feeling a pain in my appendix.

Every morning when I leave home, "he" still asks me sleepily, "What time is it?" At this time, I often feel jealous of him, and also envy him, for being able to sleep longer than me; and his office is close by, so he doesn't have to take the tram. I really resent him for being so selfish and not finding a place closer to my school. Thinking of this, I don't bother to pay attention to him. But he doesn't hate me, and he'll lean up and say gently, "Did you take your tram fare? Be sure to take your gloves, it's awfully cold outside." Then, I feel like I need to repent, and I run over and shake his hand, feeling that true love should never be about jealousy and selfishness. Although I have to work harder, his comfort can make me feel comforted, and this comfort can encourage my hard work even more.

Walking on the quiet street, the cold morning wind hits my face, but it doesn't bring any hint of early spring. The saliva I swallow contains some coagulated mud. Vegetable vendors rush to the market in groups, their hurried steps like a quickly composed piece of music. The boatmen on the Suzhou Creek float in a dreamlike dense fog. The tall buildings on both banks also seem to be draped in a layer of blue gauze. The shadow of the sun is still buried in the hazy clouds. Ah! It's truly a beautiful picture of the morning dawn!

Stepping onto the tram, I breathe a sigh of relief. It's not until I enter the school and hear the children singing the morning assembly song that the lead weight in my heart is lifted. "Class begins," "Class dismissed," from half-past eight to four in the afternoon, except for lunch and a few minutes of break, there's no time to rest. In this busyness, I don't have time to think about my troubles, and I forget the stern face of my father-in-law and the icy tone of my mother-in-law.

After dinner, I finish grading papers, take the familiar tram, and walk the familiar road... My legs are weak, my brain is heavy, and my throat is hoarse, aching with every breath. I am like a defeated soldier on the battlefield, so tired and exhausted. As my heavy steps repeat themselves as I drag myself onto the Tianhou Temple Bridge, the beautiful night scene of the Suzhou Creek immediately appears before me, making my heart feel refreshed. The lights in the tall buildings, like twinkling stars, shine in contrast, reflecting onto the undulating water, turning into pieces of silver shields, so many, so lovely, shining like pearls, diamonds, no, even like countless eyes; innocent and pure eyes, children sitting quietly in their seats listening to the teacher's lecture.... Oh! These eyes are so bright and radiant, full of infinite hope; infinite will, infinite future.... They are waiting for us to cultivate, to train, they need us to irrigate, and our hard work will be for them!

As I think and walk, I eagerly look forward to getting home soon, as "home" can let me rest.

He always arrives home one step ahead of me every day. As soon as I enter the door, I can see the back of him sitting at his desk, either writing or reading. Since I objected, I haven't seen him smoking or drinking to relax anymore. The room has been cleaned, but the cleaning is not as thorough as if I had done it myself. After washing clothes and socks, I still have to mend them. Sometimes he plays the piano, and I hum some tunes along. But, my hoarse voice makes me not want to sing anymore. Everyone pities me, that my former singing voice was lost from the time I got married. Every night I always have twelve points of confidence, hoping to recover soon, and praying silently to God.

Before going to bed, I follow the routine of going to my in-laws to greet them. They sit around a table, laughing and chattering. As soon as they see me, my father-in-law puts on a stern face and turns his body away. My mother-in-law, on the other hand, gives me a cold glance, habitually saying, "Just got back?" I can only go through the motions for a while before retreating. Alas! They are not my parents, they will not love me like my parents do, they do not like their son, and they treat me this way as well. They don't approve of me going out to work, and they're even more unhappy that their son allows me to be away from home all day, not adhering to the three obediences and four virtues. They want to bind me, to obey their orders, to be a slave to their family!

Back in the room, I don't make a sound, and I can't make a sound. Finally, he understands me, puts down his work, runs to my side, wipes away my tears and says earnestly, "Hong! Don't be sad, this family isn't us, our lives are just beginning. Please be patient with everything. In two more years, when I have developed a little, then we can break away from this cage and create a new environment, living freely and happily. Just endure the current pain!" His sincere tone stirs up my perseverance, I believe him, I look forward to him, I really hope there will be such a day.

(7) Draw a Cross on Your Face

In reality, the more Yuan Baofan understood, the more uncomfortable he became. Of course, people hate being cuckolds the most!

"Alright, pour a bucket of cold water on him first to wake him up!"

"He's already awake!"

It was true that Qiuhaitang was awake, but he really didn't have the courage to lift his head.

"Hey! Boss Wu, the Marshal has something to ask you!" Ji Zhaoxiong had completely forgotten Qiuhaitang's repeated kindness in helping him. All that remained in his mind was the resentment from the recent two instances where his demands for rice had not been met. He reached out and grabbed Qiuhaitang's long hair, forcefully pulling his head up.

At the same time, Lao Yuan also started speaking.

"Good kid, you're too ungrateful!" His eyes widened like longans, and compared to seven or eight years ago, when he was desperately trying to get Qiuhaitang to perform in Guangde, his demeanor was even more intimidating. It could almost be described as a cloud of murderous intent. "Don't you remember that if it weren't for me, Yuan, supporting you all these years, would you be where you are today? I won't say much else to you now, I'll just ask you, besides your dead daughter, who else is involved in pulling your act?" Qiuhaitang kept his eyes tightly shut, pretending not to hear anything.

"You want to pretend to be deaf? I'll be honest with you, the one inside has already given me a rundown of everything and told it all. This old woman Tian has run into you on Grain and Rice Street before!" Yuan Baofan pointed to an old woman on the left who looked just as cunning as Ji Zhaoxiong.

At the same time, Ji Zhaoxiong's hand suddenly exerted more force, almost pulling out a clump of Qiuhaitang's long hair.

The humiliation inflicted on him by this lackey who relies on his master's power, and Yuan Baofan's words that "the one inside has already given me a rundown of everything and told it all" immediately combined into an extremely potent stimulant, turning Qiuhaitang's original shame and fear into an uncontrollable rage.

Military Preparations

### Omnipotent Gun for Resisting Paratroopers

— Li Yi

The U.S. military often uses a new type of omnipotent gun to resist enemy paratroopers invading the airport. It can fire tear gas, smoke bombs, parachute-destroying fireballs, and one-pound high-explosive bombs. Ammunition is placed in twelve round holes and can be installed in three seconds. Each omnipotent gun weighs only 40 pounds. Recently, New Pinna Airport tested this omnipotent gun. The results were very good. It is said that only a few of these new weapons need to be equipped to resist the paratrooper attack.

### What I Heard About the Shanghai Conservatory of Music

— Ge Naifeng

The Shanghai Conservatory of Music on Avenue Joffre has recently received an order from the Ministry of Education to reorganize into a private music college. Preparations are now underway, and to raise funds, a concert will be held by the professors on the 5th and 6th.

The Shanghai Conservatory of Music was established in 1937. At that time, the pianist Mr. Ding Shande returned south from the National Women's Normal College in Beiping. Because he saw that besides the National Conservatory of Music, there were few other schools in the country that trained specialized music talents, he decided to establish the private Shanghai Conservatory of Music to take on the responsibility of music education.

When learning any subject, the stronger the foundation, the better your future will be. This is especially true for learning music. If you're careless about breathing techniques when learning to sing, your voice will never improve. If you're careless about fingering and posture when learning piano or violin, you can forget about making any progress. The Shanghai Conservatory of Music has always emphasized strict teaching and never compromises with students. As a result, many young students who understand the art of music have applied, with the number of students around one hundred, recently to the point where they can't even accept any more.

The conservatory has more than ten professors, all of whom are well-known musicians. Piano professor Ding Shande was a top student of Tchaikovsky and graduated from the National Conservatory of Music early. His performances have been well-received by Chinese and foreigners alike. Violin professor Chen Youxin is one of the few graduates of the violin department since the establishment of the National Conservatory of Music. His profound mastery of the art is beyond doubt. Vocal professor Zhu Qi was a top student of Professor Xu Shilin. Other foreign professors include B. Zakharoff, A. Foa, and V. Shushlin, all renowned musicians in Shanghai who personally teach.

They hold regular concerts every semester. Since its establishment, they have performed more than ten times. Currently, the school building is insufficient and cannot expand the number of students. They have begun looking for another school building to reorganize and add undergraduate and normal departments. This first professor concert will be held at the Lyceum Theatre, and the proceeds will be used for reorganization expenses. The grand occasion at that time goes without saying.

### "Princess Iron Fan" to be Screened at the Great Shanghai Theatre

The Great Shanghai Theatre's change to screening domestic films may be implemented as early as June. Zhang Shankun has put a lot of thought into the first film for the theatre. Showing "Home" at the theatre would certainly create a grand sensation, but there was a prior agreement with the Shanghai Guang and New Light Theatres, and the premiere rights for "Home" already belong to those two theatres. It is said that Zhang is considering using "Princess Iron Fan" as the first hit for the Great Shanghai Theatre. This is because it is the first feature-length Chinese cartoon, and the results of the preview screenings have been very impressive. It should be able to give the audience a fresh experience. The question, however, is whether it can be completed ahead of schedule.

### My Opinions on Yue Opera

— Chen Xi

Although I am an amateur when it comes to opera, I have a deep love for it. I have seen and heard many performances from both the North and South. However, there are two types that I have never been interested in, namely Shen Opera and Yue Opera. Local operas generally have a rustic flavor, but these two are especially so. Shen Opera aside, when it comes to Yue Opera, it can be divided into two schools: Luantan and Didu. I remember when I was young, I watched performances by Wu Changshun, Wang Xiaokui, and other actors in temple fairs in my hometown (which were martial Luantan) and found them quite enjoyable. Didu troupes were not seen as often, because they mostly performed lewd, small-scale operas that were forbidden by the authorities. When I came to Shanghai, I was dazzled by the variety of performances and neglected my hometown productions. Those that I used to find enjoyable, I now discarded as waste. Therefore, although Didu was very popular in Shanghai in recent years, I was never moved by it, thinking it unworthy of my attention. Recently, at the invitation of a friend, I watched Yue Opera many times and realized that Yue Opera was able to become popular and attract thousands of viewers in the isolated island because its plot and lyrics are simple and common, which is its strength, and it best suits the tastes of women in general. However, there are also many aspects worth discussing. For example, the sounds and tones are not distinguished between male and female roles, which is a major flaw. Other aspects, such as the plot being illogical and the irritating slapstick humor, should also be gradually improved to suit the needs of the times, in order to break my biased view that I am not interested in Yue Opera.

### Beginning in May, Theaters to Pay Huge Taxes, Ticket Prices to Increase

Various cinemas have received notices from the concession authorities that they will levy a 10% tax on ticket sales, starting in May. For example, Dahua will pay 24,000, Jincheng 14,000, and Xihai 6,200 yuan per month, etc. The amount is huge, as can be seen. This is based on the standard of full attendance every day. Theatre authorities have objections to this and will ask for business consideration. Once the tax increase is implemented, the tide will rise, and ticket prices will increase again.

(1) Xun Huisheng

Xun Huisheng, also known as Bingchao, and nicknamed Cier, initially studied Qin Opera Qingyi under Pang Qifa, and later studied Pihuang Huashan under Lu Yushan. After mastering his skills, he debuted on stage and became famous. Originally from Dongguang, Zhili, after becoming famous, his whole family lived in Yanjing. He later studied under Wang Yaoqing and was known as one of the Four Great Dan Actresses, along with Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, and Shang Xiaoyun. He traveled south many times and his reputation was very high. His art combines both civil and military skills, especially his depiction of the hearts of young girls, which is subtle and meticulous. Therefore, all the rising Dan actresses who study Huadan regard Huisheng as the standard, and he has become the founder of the Xun school. This spring, he was hired by the Golden Grand Theatre in this city and came south to perform. After only a month, he transferred to the Xinsheng Theatre. But the box office was still in short supply. Xun is usually very frugal and lives with his father and son, three generations under one roof. Recently, he will also have a grandson. The money he has earned from singing for decades has been slightly accumulated. The Liuxiang Hotel, which recently opened in the capital, was founded solely by Huisheng.

### Jade Flowers in a Rain of Blood

— Gu Mingdao

Zhang Cangqiu abandoned his life as a bandit on Rooster Mountain and went to the northeast to make a name for himself, which can be said to be a case of "where there's a will, there's a way." Who would have thought that he would become a hero in the wilderness? The affairs of the world are unpredictable, and one can never know for sure. Thinking this, he couldn't help but feel lost. After some time, he heard that Li Zicheng of Shaanxi led his troops into Jin, repeatedly capturing prefectures and counties, and his momentum was great. He sent people to Henan to contact bandits in various places, and naturally, envoys from Li Chuang were also sent to Green Stone Mountain. Li Xin had other plans and feigned compliance. The messengers left without getting what they wanted. Before long, he heard that Li Zicheng's main force had been fighting bloody battles for a long time in Daizhou and Ningwu Pass. Zhou Lianji, the commander-in-chief of Ningkai Pass, died in battle, and Jiang Xiang, the commander-in-chief of Datong, surrendered to the bandits. Wei Zicheng drove and walked to the capital. At this time, the world was shaken, and the two sides of the Yellow River were even more restless. Although Li Xin had no intention of marching north on a large scale, he recruited soldiers and horses at this time, took the food from the enemy city, and greatly increased his power, watching the situation and wanting to take the opportunity to move. At the same time, he was even more concerned about Xu Jing's safety. Who knew that Xu Jing had been in a tiger fight and a dragon fight, and had gone through many moving, amazing, and miraculous things? (End of Chapter 7)

Chapter 8 Fallen Flowers Intentionally Follow the Flowing Water

After Li Xin was captured by Red Maiden of Green Stone Mountain, Xu Jing was very worried. He thought that Li Xin's life was over. If he wanted to rescue him, he was afraid that his skills were shallow and his efforts would be in vain. He was very hesitant. The magistrate of Qi County, after reorganizing the defeated remnants, thought that Li Xin, Xu Jing, and others were all incompetent people and not worth relying on, so he became even more indifferent to Xu Jing. Xu Jing also felt bored and asked the magistrate of Qi County to leave the city and return to his home. His mother naturally followed him out of the city, but her sick body was frightened and she lay dying in bed. Medicine was ineffective, which made Xu Jing even more depressed and worried. He only drank heavily every day and was very bored. Before Li Xin returned after breaking free, Xu Jing's old mother passed away. After mourning, Xu Jing bought a high-quality coffin to hold his mother's remains, buried her in the ancestral tomb, and was left alone, even more desolate. At that time, the news from various places was not good, and the chaos in the world had already formed. He sighed to himself: "A man born at this time should not think about rising up and establishing fame, wouldn't it be wasting time, resigning himself to decline, and turning into rotten wood that cannot be carved?" So he thought of Wang Yongtai in Daizhou, and Zhang Cangqiu and others were far away in the northeast, and there was still no news. He didn't know what achievements they had made. Zhou Yuji, the commander-in-chief of Ningwu Pass, was one of the most capable generals of the time; Wang Yongtai was also his father's friend and would definitely help him. It would be better to go there and try it out first. Once he made up his mind, he entrusted the affairs of his home to his servant Liu San. He tidied up his luggage, brought the Scarlet Phoenix Sword, and rode a fine horse, abandoning his pen and joining the army, heading straight for Daizhou. (53)

### An Abstract of the Philosophy of Diligence

— Zong Yu

Not enough, not enough, an immeasurable amount of not enough, is the factor that produces the spirit of daily renewal, and the spirit of daily renewal is the factor of human civilization. Repentance and remorse, recording sins, this is passive daily renewal; unceasing effort and diligence, this is active daily renewal. To put it in fashionable terms, it is revolutionary spirit.
