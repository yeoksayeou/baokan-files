### US President to Announce Plan: Strong Naval Construction Policy, Urge Repeal of Neutrality Act and Implementation of Escorts, Greer Incident Increasingly Significant

United Press International, Hyde Park, 8th: While the content of President Roosevelt's speech has not been formally hinted at, general speculation is that the speech will announce the President's plan to: (1) order the Navy to protect supply ships heading to Britain and all outposts such as Iceland; (2) urge the immediate repeal of the Neutrality Act so that American ships can sail in British and other belligerent waters; (3) build a stronger naval policy to cope with Axis armed vessels attacking within the US Navy patrol zone; and (4) expand aid to Britain and the Soviet Union as a prelude to the introduction of a new Lend-Lease Act. The President is also expected to announce the trend of US-Japan negotiations.

Reuters, Washington, 8th: News from Hyde Park that President Roosevelt is considering escorts in light of the Greer incident has aroused close interest here. However, the details are still unknown. German accusations of the US President's remarks are seen here as ridiculous, as no one believes the Greer had orders to do anything other than defend itself. Furthermore, the Greer was clearly marked, and the submarine commander could not possibly have mistaken the American ship for a British one through his periscope above the water. What initially seemed minor now threatens to become an important diplomatic issue. Although no one believes the United States will enter the war as a result, US-German relations will become even more strained, and future similar incidents are bound to stir American indignation.

United Press International, New York, 8th (Shipping News): Most people in the financial community believe that the United States will participate in the war. Wall Street is already discussing which industries will profit after peace is achieved. Wall Street believes that the United States will eventually be drawn into a "shooting war," based on the premise that the war will definitely be prolonged and that Germany and the United States will inevitably clash over control of Atlantic sea lanes. If peace in Europe is achieved through Germany's victory due to the United States not participating in the war, its impact on the American economy will be very different from the scenario where the United States participates in proposing peace terms.

Havas, New York, 7th: The New York Times recently commented on the USS Greer incident, stating that the Neutrality Act has now lost its meaning, and the various restrictions it stipulates should be reconsidered. In short, the time has come to arm American merchant ships and have them escorted by the fleet to their destinations.

Havas, Swiss Capital, 7th: A correspondent for the Neue ZÃ¼rcher Zeitung in Berlin reports that Germany has no intention of negotiating with the United States regarding the USS Greer incident and intends to drop the matter. This is evidenced by the fact that German newspapers are avoiding commenting on it. However, the general public in Berlin is quietly awaiting President Roosevelt's speech, as Roosevelt is certain to address the issue of Iceland.

### New York Studies Population Evacuation, Plan in Draft

United Press International, New York, 8th: Under the guidance of New York Lieutenant Governor Poletti and Housing Commissioner Weinfeldt, New York is studying various issues related to wartime population evacuation. The plan is currently in the drafting stage, but it is understood that the organizers are planning to move one million women, children, the elderly, and the sick to quiet towns and villages. The main problem, of course, is how to find places to live for the evacuees. A survey is underway in Sullivan County in southwestern New York State to determine how many people it can accommodate in an emergency. Representatives from the New York State Housing Department and the Health Department recently met with officials from the Sullivan County Hotel Owners Association. The hotel owners will cooperate in a survey to determine how many evacuees can be accommodated on farms, how many places are available in various annual hotel camp clubs and other buildings, and how much work is needed to make other hotels suitable for year-round residence (Sullivan County is a summer resort). In addition, committees will study the quantity of water and sanitation facilities, as well as transportation issues. Evacuation officials are studying methods to place evacuees as close as possible to the city without overburdening the department's transportation facilities. Inland families are considered the most suitable, or assistance may be requested from neighboring areas such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, as there may be suitable locations there.

### Brazilian President Delivers Speech Celebrating Independence Day, Preparing to Resist Aggression

Reuters, Brazilian Capital, 8th: In a speech to the public on Brazil's Independence Day, the Brazilian President said that the policy of the Americas is that aggression from any direction will be resisted by the largest number of countries forming a defensive alliance. Brazil's 119th Independence Day can still be celebrated with joy, as Brazil, both government and people, has been able to avoid war despite difficult times. Brazil is a peaceful country, aiming to avoid the terrible war, but we cannot foresee how things will develop. We must be prepared and not harbor optimistic illusions.

US Promises Material Aid to Brazil

International News Service, Washington, 8th

### Britain Takes Firm Stand, Strengthens Malaya's Strength, Large Number of Bombers Arrive in Singapore, Cooper Gives Speech on Bandit Island

United Press International, Singapore, 8th: British military authorities issued a communique stating that another large number of the latest Blenheim bombers arrived in Singapore today, further enhancing the Royal Air Force's offensive capabilities in the Far East. As a result, Malaya's offensive and defensive capabilities have increased threefold in one week. A large number of Indian troops and British artillery regiments arrived here last Wednesday. On Saturday, thousands of Indian troops and a Scottish artillery regiment arrived. They are all equipped with the latest weapons and are fully mechanized. The communique stated that for some time, our policy has been to strengthen the Royal Air Force in Malaya with aircraft shipped from the United States. However, recently, in addition to the arrival of a large number of officers and soldiers, repair equipment and complete aircraft have been shipped from British factories. This means that the Royal Air Force in the Far East is now supplied with personnel and materials from Britain, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. The new Blenheim bombers shipped from Britain have a maximum speed of 300 miles per hour when fully loaded and can stay in the sky for six hours.

United Press International, Manila, 8th: Duff Cooper arrived here today on the Anzac Clipper, accompanied by his wife, Diana, and his staff, including former Shanghai Municipal Council officials Dong Kaiziwei and Russell. They will continue to Singapore tomorrow on the Clipper. Duff Cooper declared that he believes Japan will carefully consider its future actions because Britain will take a firm stand in the Far East. He also said that he expects to stay in the Far East for three to four months, mostly in Singapore, but he hopes to visit the Dutch East Indies, Australia, Hong Kong, Chongqing, and Burma. He said that he came to the Far East to investigate and report to the British War Cabinet on whether to appoint a representative to the Far East to manage political issues at the highest level, as a position already established in the Middle East. He also said that the eight British countries are willing to give up part of American aid to supply the Soviet Union. This will be a major topic of discussion at the upcoming Moscow Three-Power Conference. He will also investigate whether British raw materials in the Far East, such as rubber and tin, can be supplied to the Soviet Union. Kai Ziwei said that he expects to return to Shanghai after the war to resume his duties at Jardine Matheson.

### Roosevelt's Mother Dies, Important Speech Postponed, Mrs. Roosevelt Sr. Devoted to Charity During Her Lifetime, Funeral Held Today in Hyde Park

Reuters, New York, 8th: Mrs. Roosevelt Sr., mother of US President Roosevelt, felt unwell on the night of the 5th, and her condition worsened the next day, falling into a coma for 12 hours. Doctors believed it was due to circulatory failure due to old age. She passed away at 11:15 AM (Eastern Time) on the 7th, at the age of 87. President Roosevelt and his wife were at her bedside when she passed away. A private funeral will be held on the 9th. Mrs. Roosevelt Sr. was born in Newburgh, New York. In her childhood, her father traveled to the Far East for business, and she lived in Hong Kong for many years. She returned to the United States in 1880 and married James Roosevelt. James passed away in 1900, when the President was only 18 years old. His mother raised him into adulthood and witnessed his rise to become a world figure. In 1937, when she was 83 years old, she was invited by the French government to visit the Paris Exposition and was welcomed by the French government and people. She was devoted to charity throughout her life. She often resided in a villa near Val-Kill this summer and came to Hyde Park at the end of last month.

Reuters, Hyde Park, 8th: The funeral of Mrs. Roosevelt Sr. will be held at home, with only relatives and elderly neighbors attending. She will be buried in the family cemetery behind St. James Church, in a plot to the left of her husband James's tomb, according to Dutch custom.

United Press International, Hyde Park, 8th: Mrs. Roosevelt Sr. passed away yesterday at her ancestral private residence on the Hudson River. She had opposed her son's political activities but had personally witnessed Roosevelt being elected President of the United States three times.

Havas, Washington, 7th: Mrs. Roosevelt Sr. was born on September 21, 1854, the daughter of a banker. She had only one son, President Roosevelt.

### Australian Business Leader Discusses Mission to Britain, Seeks Close Liaison Between Both Sides on Major Wartime Issues

Reuters, Sydney, 8th: Sir Page, the Australian business leader who will soon go to London as a representative of the Australian government, stated last night, "My work is to establish direct contact between the British and Australian Cabinets. I am directly responsible to the Australian Parliament and people. The most important purpose of my mission is to present Australia's strategic views on certain major issues and the near future. The decisive purpose is to devise the best plan to maintain the system of direct participation in the Cabinet in London."

Reuters, Sydney, 8th: Australian Prime Minister Fadden broadcast yesterday, reviewing two years of war efforts, saying that at least one in every four Australians of military age has enlisted, so the Australian army, navy, and air force personnel total 400,000. In another two years, this number will exceed 600,000. Another 200,000 people are directly or indirectly engaged in the production of munitions and supplies. The number of Australian naval personnel has tripled, and the number of air force personnel has increased sevenfold.

Former Minister Calls for Radical Action, Kaito Advocates Concessions

Havas, Tokyo, 7th: Former Home Minister General Suekichi recently told a reporter from the Asahi Shimbun that a ship should not return before a storm occurs. Therefore, the current situation gives us the feeling of sailing in a storm. No matter how fierce the headwinds are, we should not change course at first. I am willing to serve the Emperor as an ordinary citizen. Although the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has not been able to submit a report to the government, it has paid close attention to the wishes and suggestions of the people. It is reported that General Suekichi is a leader of the extreme right wing in Japan. Recently, he resigned as chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association due to disagreements with Prime Minister Konoe on diplomatic matters.

Havas, Tokyo, 7th: Prominent political commentator Muto has recently published articles in the "Hochi Shimbun" advocating Japan-US understanding and urging Japan to adopt a moderate attitude. One article, titled "Building a Hundred-Year Plan for East Asia," states, "When a country is expanding its power abroad, it must be able to rein in its horses at the edge of the cliff when necessary, so that it can get a chance to breathe and make a comeback in the future." I still remember after the Sino-Japanese War in the mid-19th century, Japan demanded that China cede the Liaodong Peninsula, but Russia, Germany, and France united to oppose it. We had no choice but to make concessions. If we had been willing to fight the three countries at that time to achieve our long-cherished wish, what would have happened? As a result, we would have failed due to exhaustion of our strength. Therefore, if our country can temporarily retreat and work twice as hard to complete its great cause in the future, it should resolutely do so. I dare say that even if we do our best to build a "New East Asia," it cannot be done in less than a hundred years." The Hochi Shimbun was originally a pro-German nationalist newspaper but was recently acquired by the Yomiuri Shimbun. Muto has always been regarded as a powerful figure opposed to Britain and the United States, so his views are quite intriguing.

### Japanese Troops Invading Taihu Area Have Been Repelled, Fierce Fighting Now Taking Place South of Yueyang, Japanese Troops in Fuzhou Were Forced to Withdraw

Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman declared today that fierce fighting is now taking place south of Yuezhou after Japanese troops began an attack there on Sunday morning.

The Japanese troops invading the Taihu area have been repelled, suffering 500 casualties. It is reported that between August 30 and September 3, 4,500 Japanese troops in three columns attacked multiple strongholds on the south bank of Taihu Lake but were all repelled to their original bases in Wuxing, Changxing, and a certain area of Wujiang. The spokesman also said that the Japanese army lost 6,000 men during its 135-day occupation of Fuzhou. The spokesman admitted that Chinese troops only entered Fuzhou after the Japanese troops had completely withdrawn. However, he said that there was much evidence in the city of Fuzhou to show that the Japanese troops had withdrawn in haste. Most of the military equipment in Fuzhou and Magong remained untouched, and the warehouses and docks were not destroyed, which showed that the Japanese troops were forced to withdraw. (UPI, 8th)

Editorial

### Interpreting Mr. Milne's New Economic Policy

Mr. Milne, Chairman of the British House of Commons National Expenditure Committee, recently delivered a speech outlining a new economic policy. This symbolizes the will of the public and their high expectations. With Mr. Milne's position, he frankly expresses his just aspirations, which shows the yearnings of the people. Mr. Milne first cites the heavy impact of the economic panics of 1921 and 1931 and the uneconomical relief measures as the basis for reforming economic policy. Firstly, a good economic system should not only provide prescribed relief for the elderly, those unable to work due to chronic illness, and the unemployed, but also ensure that everyone obtains permanent work and remuneration. Secondly, the monetary and financial policies in a good system must enable everyone to enjoy the country's resources and achieve stable prices. However, judging from the past twenty years, the reality is far from the aforementioned goals. This is why the system urgently needs to be corrected.

Mr. Milne then eloquently argues that the lack of consumption has been an obstacle to the past economic system, while the progress of modern science has continuously improved and simplified production methods. This indicates that today's problem is one of consumption, not production. It is often heard that millions of people suffer from cold and hunger, while at the same time, huge amounts of food are thrown into the sea or burned to create artificial scarcity and secure higher prices. The powerful vitality of consumption in promoting production and efficiency is ignored. Any increase in wages is inevitably pointed to as raising costs, not realizing that this is an unnecessary worry. Even if the cost calculated in monetary units increases indefinitely, what does it matter if it is supported by sufficient consumption? It is not difficult to imagine.

The importance of consumption is so great that it cannot be measured by ordinary logic. To merely provide relief for life and cultivate a dependence on unearned income is a modern, unfortunate contradiction. Some say that this is due to the lack of work to control and is a measure of last resort. However, the reason for this is entirely due to the lack of consumption. If work can be given and rewarded, the necessary consumption can be generated, which in turn promotes increased production and work. This point may seem illusory and specious at first glance, but if one examines the operation of the current economic structure, one will realize that the role of consumption is like a machine that needs to be fueled and stoked to drive its work. The income earned can then be used to clear the initial consumption expenditure. It is often said that there are too many people for the available jobs, but in fact, the problem is that there are too few jobs for the available people. The reason for this is that we do not know what to do with them. We now know how to recycle waste, so how can there be wasted people who should be left idle? In other words, in the modern economic structure, human resources are still the most important factor. Therefore, we must make good use of this precious factor to benefit the construction of national and social undertakings.

So where does the vitality of consumption lie? Even if we want to consume, if there is no medium of currency and no standard of value, how can we achieve this goal? The key to this lies in the proper use of currency and its smooth circulation and solution. Today, everything has its definite and unshakeable measure and weight, but the standard of currency value is uniquely absent. When Sir Macmillan compiled the report in 1931, he focused on the stability of currency value, but to no avail. Moreover, the stability of currency value is not limited to the issue of units. The impact of the use of large amounts of funds on the vitality of consumption and the maintenance of currency levels is important. Therefore, we must also consider the issue of credit lending.

The operation of banks in lending has always been based on the interests of shareholders. However, under the conditions after the war, the maintenance of price levels and the control of the expansion and contraction of credit lending must be the starting point. At the same time, the settlement of international payments must be clearly separated from domestic production and consumption and must not be intertwined. In the past, when there was a deficit in international payments and gold was exported for repayment, domestic credit lending was often tightened, leading to a sudden drop in production or a decline in consumption, resulting in panic. In order to realize the aforementioned new economic policy, it is advisable to establish a new central bank or expand the functions of the existing central bank, and issue more credit lending chips with commercial paper as collateral, including short-term production and sales of goods, long-term fixed assets, and other construction assets that can enhance social prosperity and happiness as collateral; however, all speculative transactions will be excluded.

Finally, Mr. Milne loudly proclaimed that money has been the master of men for too long. We must make it our servant before we can. The key to the institutional problem lies in stimulating conscience, not in transforming the mind.

In summary, the brewing of the new economic policy has been going on for a long time, and Mr. Milne's suggestion is undoubtedly a response to the will of Heaven and the people. Moreover, it has many insightful and unique points. It will undoubtedly be an important plan for institutional reform. Looking back at China's economic structure, it is inevitable that there are shortcomings. Therefore, the need for adjustment after the war is urgent. Therefore, this explanation is provided as a source of inspiration for others.

### Chinese Government Satisfied with US-Japan Talks, Government Spokesman Jiang Tingfu Speaks

Chongqing: Government spokesman Dr. Jiang Tingfu, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, stated today that the Chinese government is very satisfied with the US-Japan talks held in Washington. However, he declined to say whether the United States had notified the Chinese government of the situation in the talks. Jiang said that China is not worried about the United States resuming the sale of oil and steel to Japan and the Soviet Union. Jiang also explained the important reforms in the financial system implemented by China at the beginning of this year, which will result in a greater enhancement of China's financial unity. He pointed out that the provinces have been politically unified in recent years, and until now, they have been virtually completely independent financially. However, starting on January 1, 1942, there will be other important changes. Most of the taxes will be collected by the central government, and the budgets of the provinces will also be prepared by the central government. (UPI, 8th)

### Military Affairs Commission Transportation Control Bureau: Chairman Chiang Concurrently Serves as Director, Yu Fei-peng Fills Deputy Director Position, Chen Yi Succeeds as Director of Rear Service

Chongqing: The Military Affairs Commission Transportation Control Bureau is headed by Chairman Chiang, who also serves as director.

The bureau's chief of staff, Yu Fei-peng, has now taken over the deputy director role. Qian Dajun has been appointed as the new chief of staff. To focus on bureau affairs, Yu has resigned from his position as Director of the Rear Service Department. Chen Yi, the recently relieved chairman of Fujian, will succeed him in this vacant position. This personnel change indicates that the government will further strengthen transportation management to increase efficiency, with a particular focus on the Yunnan-Burma Road. (Havas, 8th)

### Exchange Stabilization Committee Announces Anglo-American Banks Agree to Cooperate, British and American Treasuries Also to Cooperate with Banks, Committee Member Fox Returns to Hong Kong from Manila

Hong Kong: Mr. Fox, the chief American representative of the Chinese Currency Stabilization Fund Committee, arrived in Hong Kong today from Manila. At the same time, the Stabilization Committee announced that Anglo-American banks have agreed to fully cooperate with the committee. Although it had been reported that "Mr. McKie, Supervisor of the Citibank China branches in Shanghai, and Mr. Hawkins, Manager of the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China in Shanghai, will meet with Mr. Fox," they suddenly returned to Shanghai today after staying here for several days.

The American government has already dispatched personnel to China and Hong Kong to undertake this work. (United Press, 8th)

### Japan's Misunderstanding of China Will Inevitably Lead to Greater Difficulties, Endner Publishes Essay in New York

New York: Mr. Endner, the famous Australian advisor to Chairman Chiang, wrote in the "Colliers Magazine" yesterday that Japan cannot defeat China. On the contrary, the Japanese army will be broken up in Chinese territory. Mr. Endner's article was published in the September 13th issue of the magazine, which was sold in advance yesterday. Mr. Endner has been with Chairman Chiang for many years and is regarded by Chairman Chiang as his most trusted confidant. Mr. Endner stated that Japan's main mistakes regarding China are as follows: (1) Failing to understand the new patriotic fervor, unity, and fighting spirit of the Republic of China. (2) Tokyo believes that the Chinese people will "not be able to endure." (3) Regarding the actions of the Japanese army, Mr. Endner stated that the Chinese army is using guerrilla tactics to cause great difficulties for the Japanese army. He also stated that China will not collapse due to the withdrawal of German military advisors, because the country had a complete organization from the beginning of the war to strive for victory. Mr. Endner also said that the Japanese army has repeatedly tried to shorten the war front in China, but without success, and is being constrained and unable to seek peace with China to engage in other adventurous endeavors. Mr. Endner said that Japan has discovered that it is being broken up in China. Mr. Endner also expressed his respect for Chairman Chiang's statement that "As long as the Japanese army is in China for one day, there will be no peace." (United Press, 8th)

### On the Central Gomel Front, Soviet Counteroffensive Achieves Great Victory, Fierce Fighting Intensifies on the Outskirts of Leningrad, Soviets Utilize Swamps to Greatly Defeat German Advance

United Press, Reek, 8th: The "ZÃ¼rich" newspaper stated yesterday that several reports indicate that Soviet troops have begun a fierce counteroffensive with a large army and a large number of armored units, including four heavy armored divisions. It also stated that this fierce counteroffensive is apparently taking place on the central front, led by Marshal Timoshenko, and on the Nepor River front, commanded by Marshal Budyonny, making a strong strategic move against several points on the east bank of the German army. The Soviet army is also attempting to cross the Nepor River. The newspaper stated, however, that the German army said that the Soviet army has been repelled and suffered great losses. It also stated that the Soviet counteroffensive is temporarily intended to make the German army focus its attention on defensive work.

United Press, Moscow, 8th: The army mouthpiece "Red Star" stated yesterday that the Soviet counteroffensive in the Koks Heem and Gomel areas has achieved another victory. The news stated that the infantry in the Gomel area took the offensive against the left flank of the German vanguard, destroying its resistance. The Red Army therefore recovered several villages and towns. The Soviet troops in the Koks Heem area defeated the German army. It is heard that the German side scurried away from the deep forest.

Havas, somewhere on the Soviet border, 7th: The general trend of the war on the Western Front today is as follows: In the northern sector, the fierce fighting on the outskirts of Leningrad is intensifying. The German army is pouring all its artillery and air force to obtain some ground in the suburbs of the city, and is now using long-range heavy artillery to bombard the city in an attempt to take it in one fell swoop. The Red Army is using the swampy areas to launch a desperate counteroffensive against the German army, trying to force the German army to abandon mobile warfare and switch to positional warfare, and to prevent the Finnish army in the north from connecting with the German army in the southwest. In the central and southern sectors of Gomel and Kiev, the fighting is also very fierce, and both sides have suffered heavy losses. In the southern sector, the Odessa area and the lower reaches of the Nepor River are temporarily in a stalemate. The situation of the Red Army there is very stable.

United Press, Moscow, 8th: Soviet aircraft yesterday heavily bombed the German troops attacking Leningrad, causing heavy casualties to the Germans. An official communiquÃ© stated that Soviet aircraft groups have cooperated with the army to defend Leningrad. It also stated that in the more southerly area, Soviet aircraft also bombed the German army and inflicted heavy casualties.

International News Agency, Moscow, 8th: According to Moscow's official broadcast news, fierce air battles are continuing over the besieged Leningrad and its entrance. The "Stalin's Falcons" have shot down more than 300 German aircraft. Tens of thousands of workers in Leningrad are building new defense works along the city. Marshal Voroshilov stated that the Soviet army will fight to the "last man" to prevent the German army from invading.

Havas, Stockholm, 8th: The Finnish army stopped its advance after taking Vyborg a week ago. Now it has launched another offensive yesterday to join the German army in encircling Leningrad. The Finnish army has already reached the southern end of the Svir River between Lake Ladoga and Lake OnÃ©ga, about 125 miles from Leningrad.

Reuters, Moscow, 8th: According to recent news here, the German army has not approached the southwest side of Leningrad and is even further away from the communication lines southeast of the city. Although the railway passing through Leningrad is temporarily blocked, the German army has not occupied the southwest and southeast communication lines, so it is absurd to say that the city has been isolated. At the same time, the Soviet army has continued to report victories in local battles in the western region. In a certain area of Gomel, a certain Soviet infantry division, after defeating the German army's fierce resistance, has recovered several places with many residents, and destroyed 21 German tanks and many artillery pieces. At another location in the western region, the bridgehead built by the German army on the Kerma River was destroyed by Soviet aircraft dive-bombing, and hundreds of German soldiers were killed and unable to cross the river. Soviet aircraft also attacked two airfields, destroying 25 German aircraft and damaging many others in the fields.

The latest Soviet communiquÃ© did not disclose new developments, only stating that on September 7, the Soviet army continued to fight fiercely with the enemy along the entire line. The Soviet Air Force launched a concentrated attack on the enemy army and attacked the enemy air force in the airfields, destroying a total of 23 enemy aircraft, including air battles. The Soviets lost 11 aircraft. The German submarine U-73 Wren was captured by the Soviets in the Baltic Sea.

Leningrad's Defenses Are Strong, Nazi Offensive at a Loss

Reuters, London, 8th: Military commentators say that the battle for Leningrad at the end of the week is still quite fierce. Both sides are evenly matched and the outcome is uncertain. The latest Soviet communiquÃ© is brief, only stating that the war is continuing. The German side also only routinely claims that the war is "proceeding according to plan." Although the German army is launching a huge offensive, it seems that there are no concrete battle results to report since it declared two days ago that Leningrad was under fire. Even if the statement that the city is under fire is true, it is not of particular significance, because Odessa on the Black Sea, Tobruk in North Africa, and even Dover in England are all under German fire, but the German army can only hope for them but not touch them. The seriousness of the German offensive against Leningrad cannot be underestimated. Undoubtedly, the Soviet side knows the strategic importance of the city, so it is doing its best to defend it. If Leningrad falls before winter arrives, then a portion of the German army there can move inland and spy on Moscow, and it can use the port of Leningrad as a valuable supply base to avoid the suffering of transportation through muddy and snowy roads. However, the Gulf of Finland is frozen for several months in the winter, so it will still be obstructed by ice. The German army is now encountering Leningrad's impregnable defenses. The city can only be seriously threatened in the southwest direction, but that direction is protected by three lines of concentrated fortresses. Its strength is worthy of being the strongest defense in the world. Although it is not necessarily unbreakable, the German army will suffer heavy casualties if it wants to capture the city. Even if the German army reaches the suburbs of this large city with three million people, its difficulties will only begin, because the outer waterways and canals are intertwined and cannot be easily crossed. The southern district of the city alone has five canals, while the east and west are protected by the 400-yard-wide Neva River. The Soviet army is determined to fight step by step in every riverbank and every house. Since winter is approaching rapidly, it is not difficult to imagine that the German army will suffer great casualties and losses before it publishes a communiquÃ© declaring that it has captured Leningrad "according to plan."

Fierce Battles on the Highway to Odessa, Over Ten Thousand German and Romanian Troops Killed or Wounded

TASS, Moscow, 8th: There is still fierce fighting on the highway to Odessa. The German and Romanian troops have suffered heavy losses. More than 10,000 people have been killed or wounded in a few days. There are too many German wounded, and there are not enough ambulances to distribute them, so that half of the wounded die before reaching the hospital.

Reuters, Madrid, 8th: A Spanish newspaper's Berlin dispatch stated that the Soviet troops stationed in Odessa have no shortage of air support. Although the seven airfields in the area are only used for supplies and cannot be used as air force bases, Soviet military aircraft fly non-stop from Crimea to Odessa, challenging the German air control.

In Two Months of Fighting on the Eastern Front, Over Seven Thousand German Aircraft Damaged or Destroyed

Reuters, Moscow, 8th: Soviet Air Force Major General Gordendal wrote an article published in "Red Star" stating that the German side has almost used its entire air force to attack the Soviet Union, and has failed to achieve its main goal in two months of fighting, which is to gain absolute air superiority. Moreover, the air battles have proven that the Soviet Air Force is not only not weaker than the German side, but also superior to it in many aspects. The enemy has also admitted that the Soviet aircraft's new fighter jets are of excellent quality. The German side has lost more than 7,200 aircraft in the recent two months of war against the Soviet Union. This kind of battle result is unprecedented in the history of air warfare. More than 2,000 enemy aircraft have been destroyed on the ground by the Soviet Air Force. The Soviet artillery also inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. Enemy aircraft teams scattered in disorder when attacked by Soviet aircraft. On the first day of the war, the 51st and 54th Bomber Squadrons of the German Air Force Aviation Corps, commanded by General Glim, lost three-tenths of their aircraft, and the 55th Squadron lost half. The German Air Force suffered the heaviest losses in the operational areas of the German Corps Generals Kesselring and Stumpff on the western and southwestern fronts. Before the German attack on the Soviet Union, it lost 300 aircraft in 1939, 6,800 aircraft in 1940, and 1,350 to 1,700 aircraft in the first five months of 1941. Currently, the German side is mostly using the Heinkel 111, Dornier 215, Junkers 88, and Messerschmitt 109 models, and is also trying its best to accelerate the production of the new Heinkel 123 fighter. Captured German pilots said that they highly regarded the Soviet new fighter jets, which they called EYC-17. In this decisive war, the Soviet side did not use large airfields, and most of the bases were small airfields with 40 to 50 aircraft that were well hidden. If the range of activity and intensity of the front line from Barents to the Black Sea continues unchanged, then the losses of German aircraft will inevitably increase greatly in another two or three months. At present, the German Air Force only has several thousand pilots with good technical skills, and the rest are trained in haste. The result will be an increase in its losses. According to German prisoners, most of the current German pilots only entered the air force in the second half of 1940 or the first half of this year. Furthermore, before the German attack on the Soviet Union, if it mobilized a part of its air force to fight, its aircraft factories could still replenish the lost aircraft. From May to September of last year, the German Air Force was fully mobilized, and its aircraft replenishment capacity had reached its limit. Therefore, in these five months, it was no longer able to expand the German Air Force. The German side lost less than 9,000 aircraft in the wars before the attack on the Soviet Union, but the German side had to make extra efforts to replenish them, and sometimes had to reduce the scope of its air force's military operations. From this, it can be seen how significant the losses of the German Air Force in the war against the Soviet Union are. Now, the German Air Force is forced to reduce the scope of its operations and transfer its aircraft teams back and forth on the front line, and even if German aircraft factories work as quickly as possible, they cannot replenish the German aircraft's major losses. The strength of the Soviet Air Force is inexhaustible and is increasing day by day.

### Soviet Women's World Holds Anti-Fascist Conference, Resolves to Appeal to the World to Unite, British Women's Groups Telegraph in Response

Havas, Moscow, 7th: The Soviet women's world held an anti-fascist conference here today, and immediately passed a resolution by unanimous vote, appealing to women in all countries of the world, especially women in the United Kingdom and the United States, to unite and form a women's anti-Nazi front.

Reuters, London, 8th: Thirty-eight British women, representing various national work, religious, political, social and sports activities, have telegraphed congratulations to the Soviet women's conference held yesterday, saying, "We British women welcome Soviet women as comrades in the struggle of all free people against the Nazi threat. Like Soviet women, we stand side by side with the men on the front line in homes, factories and armies. We are deeply moved and encouraged by the courage and perseverance of Soviet women, and we look forward to the day when women will also have a responsibility to build freedom, stability and justice for all mankind."

### Three Terrorist Incidents in Paris in One Night, French Communist Party's Hatred of Germany Deepens

Havas, Paris, 7th: Three more anti-German terrorist incidents occurred here last night: (1) An administrative staff member in the German-occupied zone was shot and slightly injured by two thugs. (2) A German non-commissioned officer was also shot and wounded. (3) Incendiary bombs were thrown at a German military vehicle shed, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished. Regarding these unexpected incidents, the general impression obtained by the responsible parties here is that they are clearly the result of a communist conspiracy. This can be seen from the propaganda booklet published by the party on August 15, which stated that if one member of the French Communist Party is executed, ten Germans will be made to pay with their lives. At the same time, the former leader of the French Communist Party, the former Vice President of the Chamber of Deputies, DorÃ¨res, also made a declaration on the Peruvian radio station, inciting the French to rebel, including the words "Hitler is invading the Soviet Union with the army of the whole country, we must not miss this opportunity."

### Hungarian Army Chief of Staff Replaced

TASS, Budapest, 8th: According to official reports, Hungarian Army Chief of Staff General Vente has been dismissed and replaced by Hote. Hungarian officials say that Vente resigned due to illness, but according to reliable sources, he had to step down due to Nazi pressure.

### The United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China to Hold Four-Nation Science Conference in London to Study the New Post-War Construction Order

Reuters, London, August 8th - Representatives from Britain and the British Empire, as well as the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, will hold a three-day science conference in London from September 26th to 28th. This will demonstrate the common goals of scientists and ensure a post-war order that maximizes the benefits of science for all people.

### Nazi Military Activity on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast; Naval Headquarters Moved to Varna; German Delegation Arrives in Turkey for Economic Negotiations

Reuters, Ankara, August 8th - According to sources from Bulgaria, Germans are very active in Varna and Burgas on the Black Sea. There are rumors that the German naval headquarters in Turkey has been moved from Sofia to Varna.

Agence France-Presse, London, August 8th - British newspapers today continue to prominently report news that the Axis powers may take risks and take action against Turkey. The London "Daily News" reported that fishermen saw a large Axis convoy carrying reinforcements to Samos Island in Greece, where a division of guerrillas is gathering.

Reuters, Ankara, August 8th - Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr. Menemencioglu, is worried that he will be unable to immediately hold business negotiations with the German Trade Representative, Mr. Clodius. Mr. Clodius arrived in Istanbul by plane yesterday with many commercial members and is now heading here. The Turkish delegation will be led by Mr. Gischimi, a commercial advisor. It is widely believed that the new commercial agreement will stipulate barter trade worth 20 million pounds. However, given the defense uses of transportation and the difficulties of sea and air traffic, the German side may not be able to obtain all the benefits it expects from this commercial agreement. It is heard from Turkish commercial circles that the German side is very keen to obtain chromium, which Germany does not currently need, but wants to buy it in order to diplomatically strike a blow against Britain. It is said that nine German economic experts came with Mr. Clodius.

### German Army Prepares to Winter in Soviet Territory, Building Thousands of Wooden Houses

Participating were "Manchester," "Stirling," and "Halifax" bombers of various types, dropping many bombs, causing huge explosions, hitting various factories, and causing several large fires, one of which was near the main station. As for the Soviet air raid, the German side has admitted 30 deaths and 72 injuries.

### Japanese Cabinet Approves Establishment of Air Defense Bureau and Land Planning Bureau; Suzuki Declares Readiness for War

United Press, Tokyo, August 8th - The Japanese Cabinet has approved the establishment of an Air Defense Bureau and a Land Planning Bureau within the Ministry of Home Affairs. This is an important development in the government's recent stepped-up air defense campaign. This week's bulletin issued by the Cabinet Information Bureau is a special handbook on household air defense guidance, outlining various possible scenarios during air raids. However, the weekly did not specifically identify any potential attackers. The Japan Women's Aviation Association is also busy holding various air defense meetings, listening to speeches from military and police authorities. The Cabinet has also adopted a traffic officer plan for the 1941-1942 fiscal year, aimed at efficient transportation of essential goods and facilitating transportation and transit for all national defense purposes under a priority principle. Lieutenant General Suzuki, Director-General of the Cabinet Planning Board, said that "this plan is in preparation for war" to cope with the current international situation.

### Random Talk on the European War (7) (8) The Soviet Economic Defense Line

This article is a record from the American Christian Science Monitor, and is translated as follows:

Even if Hitler breaks through the "Stalin Line," Soviet resistance will not end.

The Soviet Union has five economically self-sufficient Russias, each with its own natural resources and agriculture and industry. Their level of development is such that they can maintain the survival, supply, and equipment of an army when the region loses contact with other parts. Among them, apart from two regions, namely the original industrial area in the northwest (including Moscow and Leningrad) and the Ukrainian area in the Don River basin in the European part, the remaining three regions, namely the Ural region, the Kuznetsk basin, and the Far East Pacific region, are all located in Asia.

Even if Hitler occupies Moscow, he is still a thousand miles away from the Ural Mountains, the border between Europe and Asia, which is the Soviet Union's second industrial defense line.

Building new industrial areas out of reach of the enemy has always been the main policy of the Soviet Union's economic plan. The gradual eastward shift of the Soviet Union's center of gravity is due to this. The Soviet government had no prior connection with Asia, but for strategic reasons, they had to pay attention to the East.

Under the first and second Soviet five-year plans, large-scale factories, such as the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Plant and the Kuznetsk Metal Plant, have been established on the bald slopes of the eastern Ural Mountains and the desolate plains of Siberia. The steel produced by each factory far exceeds the total national steel production before the implementation of the industrialization plan.

The initial construction plan of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Plant was originally intended to be larger than the Krupp Iron and Steel Plant, but it was reduced by half according to the original plan, but it is still the Soviet Union's number one iron factory. The implementation of this great plan has made the area a prosperous town of 200,000 residents.

In 1938, the Magnitogorsk plant produced 1.5 million tons of pig iron and 1.7 million tons of pure steel, which is more than the total annual output of Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and Poland before the war.

There are other steel plants, as well as copper and aluminum plants, etc., in the Ural region, which have either started construction or are under construction. The Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant, which supplies two-thirds of the country's tractors and tanks, is also located in the area. In addition, there are factories that manufacture aircraft and cannons and shells of various calibers. Although the Soviet authorities keep the production quantity and details of each factory strictly secret, it is said that these factories in the Ural region alone can continuously supply their army with various weapons and military supplies.

1,500 miles east of the Ural Mountains is the Kuznetsk basin, located in the heart of Siberia, and is Lenin's ideal eastern industrial area.

The coal produced in Kuznetsk accounts for more than one-fifth of the country's total production, second only to the Don River basin. Most of the coal is now transported to factories in the Ural region, Magnitogorsk, and Nizhny Tagil. The area also has rich reserves of metals such as iron, copper, and manganese. A large-scale steel plant in Nanso, a large-scale chemical industry plant, and two rubber factories have all been partially put into operation.

The rise of the German army and the increased threat of invasion have forced the Soviet Union to accelerate its eastward development, but the Soviet Union's economic defense strategy had already taken shape in early 1939, which is the so-called third five-year plan, and its detailed content was announced two years later. The main feature of this strategy is to divide the Soviet Union's industrial and economic map into five self-sufficient units, each with its own resources and agricultural and industrial manufacturing plants, and its strength is equal to or even surpasses that of a certain European power.

The new plan focuses on developing local fuel production, locating new factories near raw material production areas, and making every effort to produce grain locally. In order to encourage grain production, the government has promulgated various laws prohibiting the transportation of sweet potatoes and other staple foods from Region A to Region B via railway. The authorities also paid attention to the local climate and commissioned various botanists to improve the seeds of wheat, sweet potatoes, and vegetables in order to be suitable for planting in the far north and arid areas.

The important policy of this local self-sufficiency movement, although aimed at alleviating railway transportation congestion (cement, timber, and other building materials have been included in the list of prohibited goods and may not be transported from Siberia to the European part via railway), the fundamental reason is to enable each self-sufficient region to continue to operate and resist after losing contact with other regions during wartime.

Regarding the Soviet Union's plan to economically defend against aggression, Molotov revealed some of its content when reporting the third five-year plan to the 18th Congress of the Communist Party in March 1939, but he did not want to sensationalize, so few people outside paid attention to it at the time.

However, this plan is not without its weaknesses, the main one being that the design and implementation are inconsistent. Time does not allow for the balanced development of each region. The most developed old industrial areas are all adjacent to the aggressor country. Although the authorities have recently used the method of prohibiting the establishment of new industries to prevent the expansion of the Moscow and Leningrad regions, they have not reduced the importance of the two places in terms of national defense and economy.

The Don River basin in western Ukraine is particularly important. The Krivoy Rog iron mine in the area produces more than 16 million tons of iron sand annually, accounting for 59% of the Soviet Union's total iron sand production. The copper and iron factories in the area produce 9 million tons of pig iron and 8.5 million tons of pure steel, exceeding more than half of the Soviet Union's total steel production. The manganese produced in the area accounts for one-third of the Soviet Union's total output. If the area falls, it will be equivalent to losing half of the Soviet Union's industrial output and depriving them of one-quarter of their grain production.

However, even if the Soviet Union loses these two regions, other parts can continue to resist. As far as the three industrial areas in Asia are concerned, the Ural region is the richest and most developed. The Kostniz region has also made great progress, and only the East region is still in its infancy. Each region produces enough grain to be self-sufficient.

The Soviet Union's main oil fields are in Baku, located 700 miles southeast of the Don River basin. Baku and the Grozny oil area to its north are shielded by the steep Ural Mountains. It is more difficult for European aggressors to invade from this area than to climb to the sky. The only way is to attack via sea or Turkey. After the British army occupied Syria and the British and Soviet armies made contact in Iran, the Caucasus oil fields are no longer in danger.

Although 90% of the Soviet Union's oil industry comes from the Caucasus, the third five-year plan has opened up a second "Baku" between the Volga and Ural regions, which have the richest oil reserves in the world. Up to now, the area produces 2 million tons of crude oil annually. According to the original plan, it was planned to produce 11 million tons of oil by 1942. Ozick, 160 miles south of Magnitogorsk in the upper reaches of the Ural River, also has various oil refining equipment for large-scale refining.

The Emba oil field and the Ishimbayevo oil field east of the Ural River produce about 1 million tons of oil annually. Siberia also has several oil fields in the Kostniz basin and its east, along Lake Baikal and the Lena River. The Kamchatka Peninsula also produces crude oil. This is only the result of preliminary exploration, and more oil fields may be discovered with continued exploration.

The Soviet Union's East region still has oil fields to be developed, only along the Lena River and in the Kucha area. Sakhalin Island produces slightly more oil than pre-war Poland. Unfortunately, half of the oil resources have been leased to Japan.

If Baku falls, the Soviet Union's crude oil problem will encounter serious difficulties, but there are still huge resources that can be used, and if given time, this problem can be solved. On the other hand, the Siberian double-track railway and the railway between Lake Baikal and the Heilongjiang River, which is about to be completed, are expected to solve the transportation problem.

The Soviet Union's economic self-sufficiency plan, like other plans, has failed due to insufficient resources, but its partial achievements have given it the possibility of continuing the war.

If Hitler wants to win a complete victory, he must annihilate the entire Red Army and prevent it from conscripting endless manpower to form new armies. But the Soviet people, both men and women, have received military training, and it may be extremely difficult for Hitler to carry out this work.

Soviet civilian national defense organizations have instructed millions of male and female members in the techniques of using rifles and machine guns, as well as air defense methods. There are also many people who have received special military training, such as flying, paratrooping, and guerrilla tactics. Therefore, the broad foundation of Soviet national defense still exceeds the regular army.

Since the era of Genghis Khan's invasion of Russia, every Russian national defense plan has been based on the assumption that a large area of territory will be occupied by foreign invading forces. For six hundred years, Moscow has been invaded by foreign troops almost every century. The Tatars, Lithuanians, Poles, and French have all ravaged Russia. The Russians have always been able to maintain a part of their army, and after recovering their strength and forming a new army elsewhere, they drove the invaders out of the country.

### Ministry of Education Actively Cultivates Middle School Teachers; Orders Normal Colleges to Establish Junior Divisions to Cultivate Teachers for Junior High Schools and Simplified Normal Schools

(Chongqing News Agency) Regarding the cultivation of teachers for secondary schools, the Ministry of Education had originally set up seven Normal Colleges. This year, two more Normal Colleges have been added to Sichuan University and the Guiyang Normal College, both of which will be established and start school after the summer vacation. Now, in order to meet the urgent needs of normal schools in various provinces, the Ministry has ordered each Normal College to establish a junior division in accordance with the Normal College Regulations, in order to cultivate teachers for junior high schools and simplified normal schools. Recently, the Ministry of Education's Measures for the Establishment of Junior Divisions in Normal Colleges have been formulated and promulgated, stipulating that the junior divisions of Normal Colleges will have Chinese, History and Geography, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry courses. The number of students in each course will be determined by the Ministry, and schools will be designated, ordering the Education Bureaus of each province and city to recommend them. In addition to high school graduates and graduates of normal schools or normal subjects in middle schools who have completed their service period, students who have graduated from normal schools or the normal subjects of senior high schools, have served for one year, have excellent grades, and are willing to enter a Normal College may be recommended with the approval of the competent educational administrative authority. The recommendation procedures are that each province and city holds an examination, and in addition to checking the physical condition and oral examination, only the five subjects of Civics, Chinese, Physics and Chemistry, and History and Geography are tested. The English subject will be exempted in order to allow the graduates of normal schools to further their studies. However, those who fail the examination, are physically unsound, or whose oral examination results are not suitable for being teachers shall not be recommended. The travel expenses of each recommended student to the school shall be paid by the province or city that originally recommended them. After arriving at the school, each Normal College shall re-examine the recommended students. The subjects are the same as the recommendation examination. During the student's study period, tuition and board fees are waived, and a public scholarship may be granted at the discretion of the school. After completing three years of study and passing the examination, graduates will be awarded a graduation certificate by the college, and the Ministry of Education will issue a teacher qualification certificate for a certain subject in junior high schools or equivalent schools. The original recommending provincial and municipal educational administrative authorities will assign them for employment. Those who have served for three years, have excellent grades, and are interested in further education may take the insertion examination for the Normal College and insert into the fourth grade of study. However, during the period of study in the junior division, they may not transfer to the undergraduate course of the Normal College. In addition, when the Ministry of Education deems it necessary, it may set up special normal courses in national universities and handle them in accordance with the measures for the junior division. It is heard that the Ministry has designated 16 junior divisions and 2 special normal courses this year, with 40 students in each class, for a total of 720 students. Detailed measures will be published later.

Victory is expected in their first match against the United States today. It is reported that the American team has been weakened this year due to Carson's departure, leaving only Squiers. Therefore, they had to invite Robert Chess, a veteran from twenty years ago who represented the United States in 1921 and 1922 to win the championship, to come out of retirement. Their strength is extremely weak. The winner of the two teams is scheduled to compete with Portugal for the final spot at 3:30 p.m. tomorrow.

### Summer Basketball: Yesterday's Game Had No Result

In the third act of summer basketball, a small disturbance suddenly occurred in the game between Blue-White and Qianghua. Blue-White disagreed with Zhang Shaoqing's participation in Qianghua because Zhang Shaoqing had participated in the All-Blacks vs. Blue-White game in the summer league. They pointed out that it was against the precedent for the same player to participate in another team in the same competition. After the referee, Mr. Qu Honglu, proposed a compromise, asking Blue-White to reserve the right to protest, so that the game could proceed as usual, but it was not accepted by Blue-White. After a five-minute consideration period and the best efforts of the organizers to mediate, Blue-White insisted on its original intention, and the game could not proceed. The organizers announced that the game would be rescheduled. Yesterday's exhibition game was won by the fellow team over the star team.

### What Fans Should Know About Referees

â (Chen Linsheng)

The Peizhi Cup charity mini-ball final, Samsung vs. Shunji, was held the other day at the Poverty Children's Education Center. The game was tied, and in overtime, with five minutes left before the end, the sky was already getting dark, and it was difficult to distinguish between people and the ball. At that time, between the right corner of the Shunji goal, due to a goalkeeping foul, the referee Zhang Le blew the whistle and awarded a free kick. Unexpectedly, some spectators who did not understand the rules of the refereeing stormed onto the field and accused the referee. The crowd was in turmoil and the order was disrupted. The game could only be stopped. Referee Zhang Leshan was escorted off the field by Wei Shigeng, Cai Shengsen, Fang Rongfu, Tang Genfu, and others, barely escaping a beating. It can be said that it was extremely dangerous. The author witnessed the situation on the spot and could not help but worry deeply about the future of the sports community. Two tigers fight, and one must be injured. Players compete on the sand with their superior skills. If they lose opportunities due to bad luck, it can be said that although they lost, they still receive honor. Moreover, winning and losing are common in military affairs, and there is nothing to be surprised about. Judging from the refereeing of the game, referee Zhang Le made no mistakes. After the game, Shunji team leader Tao Jinrong also said that there was no mistake. Ultimately, some spectators lacked understanding of the small ball rules and mistakenly believed that Zhang was biased towards Xingxing, so they interfered with the referee's right to enforce the law, violated the spectator's position, and made the cup competition unable to end satisfactorily. It is a regret. Moreover, the occurrence of such an event has a very bad impression. If there are important games in the future, it will make those who are enthusiastic about serving retreat in fear, affecting the progress of the game, which is not insignificant. Moreover, the Yongye Cup final and the Coca-Cola Cup top ten team elimination round are about to be held one after another. If the spectators do not understand the true spirit of sports or the responsibilities of the referees, and the above situation occurs again, it will inevitably hinder the development of small ball. If the referees are intentionally negligent or have the intention of being biased, in addition to voluntarily sacrificing their personality and reputation, we must not only loudly denounce them, but also verbally and in writing criticize them and impose sanctions. The author sincerely hopes that the spectators will strictly abide by the order, not have preconceived notions, and not criticize referees or players due to emotional effects. In particular, do not use winning or losing to determine the joy or anger of watching the game. Only in this way can it be said that one can truly appreciate the skills of the ball.

### Grain: Foreign Rice and Ke Xian Arriving One After Another; Rice Prices Still Struggling to Rise

After the start of foreign rice trading on Monday, buying and selling were both brisk, with strong demand for both actual sales and speculation. Although prices fell once in the middle, the result was still a rebound of one or two yuan compared to the closing price on Saturday. In the morning, actual sales offices were adding orders, and both futures and spot rice were generally strong. Subsequently, the news spread that foreign rice shipments were continuing to arrive, and that a batch of Wu Xian rice could arrive within the week after the ban was lifted, which immediately lowered market prices. However, large accounts no longer sold, and floating retail investors took the opportunity to absorb, coupled with the difficulty of obtaining foreign exchange, rumors were favorable, and market prices rose with the hearts of the people. For example, the spot price of Xiao Jiao rice opened at 106 yuan in the morning, then fell to 104 yuan, and closed at 107 yuan at noon and 108 yuan in the afternoon. Foreign wharves were also at 107.4 yuan. The final price of spot No. 1 Saigon high-quality goods was 120 yuan, the general market was 118.5 yuan, 118 yuan, Zhongguan rice was 116 yuan, 115.5 yuan, No. 2 rice was 108 yuan, Huo Jiao rice was 116.5 yuan, 115 yuan, No. 2 Siam rice was 1023 yuan, Min Dang high-quality goods were 121 yuan, ordinary goods were 116 yuan to 113 yuan, secondary goods were 110 yuan, bank wharf Xiao Jiao rice was 106.5 yuan, foreign wharf was 105 yuan, broken rice was 90 yuan, and broken tips were high from 81 yuan, secondary to 77 yuan. British-American company Xiao Jiao was 132 yuan, and rice on the road was 133 yuan, broken tips were 93 yuan, and secondary goods were 89 yuan. Approximately 500 tons were traded. Sellers called for prices higher than one yuan, but no agreements were reached. The total number of spot transactions was approximately 25,000 bags.

Foreign rice is continuously arriving in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Poyang Wheel arrived in port the other day (Sunday), carrying 20,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload.

Since the adjustment of the thick and thin japonica domestic rice market two mornings ago, yesterday it was again rare, which caused local shops and others to take action to purchase. For a time, sellers were determined to sell, and they shouted hard. As a result, the market rose by one or two yuan. Early rice in Kai Nan Port was 150 yuan, 149 yuan, special japonica rice in Wuxi was 150 yuan, 148 yuan, and new japonica rice in Pudong also rose by two yuan due to the lack of sound and rare sources due to rain. It opened at 152 yuan.

Glutinous rice, amid the tightening of foreign rice and the unanimous trend of rising prices of other goods, sporadic appetites were also active, so the market showed a situation of similar supply and demand. Selling prices turned stable without honor or disgrace. It is estimated that special white Hong Kong yuan opened at 124 yuan, high-quality goods were 122 yuan, ordinary goods were 120 yuan, 119 yuan, glutinous lentils were 1112 yuan, secondary to 1089 yuan.

### Vermicelli Fluctuation, Foreign Merchants Peddling Cam Wheat to Replace Foreign Exchange

Yesterday vermicelli prices rose and fell, and then rose again. Although market prices fluctuated, the result was still a rise of about half a yuan compared to the end of last week. There were local customers adding orders for actual sales in the morning, and market prices rose with the strong buying as foreign rice rose. Subsequently, the market fell back as foreign rice declined slightly and profitable bulls sold with the market. In the afternoon, it was rumored that Hong Kong vermicelli prices were rising, and foreign exchange was difficult to obtain. Speculative skin ball trading arose at the right time. Those who held goods were also determined not to sell, and the market rose step by step. The price of Golden Dragon brand vermicelli had risen to 31.2 yuan in the early market, fell to 30.08 yuan at noon, and then rose to 31.3 yuan in the afternoon. Dong Wharf was 31.8 yuan, Fortress was from 32.6 yuan to 32.8 yuan in the morning, then fell to 32.3 yuan at the close. The closing price in the afternoon rose to 32.89 yuan, 31.95 yuan, banana was 12.2 yuan, foreign wharf was 32.15 yuan, Australian vermicelli clock tower flower bird was 33.5 yuan, domestic vermicelli was 34 yuan, and 30,000 bags were traded. Bran was in short supply, and small bags were again 33.5 yuan. Wheat sales were rare, and factory prices remained unchanged. However, foreign wheat prices were low, and foreign merchants once peddled Cam No. 3 at 58 yuan, and they could also handle foreign exchange.

### Oil Cakes: Advantageous, Rabbit Up and Falcon Down

The market for rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil showed a revolving trend yesterday. Upon checking, the market opened in the morning, and prices were seen to rise by one or two yuan due to the enthusiastic entry of many parties. Subsequently, due to poor actual sales, it caused a large number of short sellers to sell, and the market fell sharply again. It was finally sought after by non-industry speculators and recovered slightly. As a result, rapeseed oil fell by 4.5 yuan compared to last week, and cottonseed oil fell slightly by half a yuan. The general market opened with more than 4,000 loads of Qing oil from the Daya Factory for delivery next September. The opening price was 179 yuan, the highest was 181 yuan, the lowest was 175 yuan, and the closing price was 178.5 yuan. In addition, more than 2,000 barrels of rapeseed oil from the Rihua Factory opened at 185.5 yuan, the lowest was 177 yuan, and the closing price was 179.75 yuan. A real sales household on this street bought more than 100 barrels of soybean oil from the Rihua Factory for 110 yuan, 100 barrels of green raw oil for 272 yuan to 275 yuan, and 100 loads of Qing oil from the Daya Factory for 177 yuan. Also, on the 9th, export goods, 70 bags of soybeans, and 900 pieces of soybean cake were transported to Xiamen.

### Living on Vegetables and Tofu Still Costs Ten Yuan a Day; Practicing Not Tasting Meat for Three Months; Rent and Daily Necessities All Outside

The expensiveness of vegetables and food these days is unparalleled, and it is led by oil beans. The expensiveness of oil beans is orchestrated by Dalian Japanese merchants and Shanghai oil merchants. The expensiveness of vegetables is also affected by oil beans, such as tofu and fried tofu, but most of it is due to the harsh levies of bridgehead donation cards and the price increases by vendors, as well as the gradual control of sources and heavy exploitation. According to current prices, it is really not easy to live in a family. Let's calculate roughly as follows, with one yuan as the unit:

Pork 4 taels

Vegetables 1 catty and 4 taels

Soybean oil 7.5 taels

Potatoes 1.5 catties

Old tofu 5 pieces

Large dried mackerel 1 catty

Taro 2 catties

Edamame 1 catty and 4 taels

Alfalfa 12 taels

Celery 5 bundles

Xiao Jiao rice 9 he

Coal balls 6 catties

Large duck eggs 2.5

Tofu skin 20 pieces

According to this calculation, a family of six needs three liters of rice a day, six catties of coal balls, and four taels of oil, plus other side dishes, which costs about ten yuan a day. It is still mostly vegetables and tofu, practicing "not tasting meat for three months."

### Yarn and Cotton: Covering Shorts and Cutting Longs Rose Together; Shuangma Was Going Forward in a Zigzag; Futures Yarn Was Even More Powerful

The yarn market is rising, and the upward trend is becoming more and more intense. This is because competition in the market is gradually increasing, which makes people's hearts active. As a result, short sellers are covering and turning long. As a result, the chips are tighter, and the market is advancing in a zigzag. However, actual transactions are not smooth. Hong Kong merchants only handled a few dozen bales, so some of them closed out many of their positions. The surface is still hard with flatness. Another saying is that the demand from Southeast Asia continues to be good. This is why the price of yarn is firm. The high price of 20s Shuangma was 1,749 yuan, and the low price was 1,735 yuan. The market opened flat in the afternoon, and the price was 1,743 yuan. It was then heard that the price on the exchange was rising, and people's hearts were excited. Buyers came one after another, and the price continued to rise to 1,761 yuan at the close. Currently, the foundation of the yarn market for miscellaneous brands is solid, and the longs are absorbing and holding back. Today, 20 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen, and 705 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

Shuangma Morning: The momentum turned upward due to the active covering of floating shorts. The opening price was 1,738 yuan, and it gradually rose to 1,741 yuan. However, large accounts sold out at a profit, and the price fell back to 1,735 yuan. The opening price on the exchange rose, and the market was bullish. At this price, between 1,743 and 1,744 yuan, for a long time, it rose to 1,749 yuan, and then the short sellers came to sell again, falling back to 1,700 yuan. However, spot yarn transactions were mediocre, and the closing price was 1,745 yuan. The statistics of the amount purchased by each gang are listed as follows:

Hong Kong 10,008

Statistics 8,010

The futures market for Jin Shuangma was soaring, and the trend was exceptionally strong. This is because American cotton is rising, and people's hearts can rely on it to go upward. Moreover, the exchange is stepping up, which makes the longs pull up, so the futures yarn is also shining, and there is also a tendency to rise to the top. When the factory orders were first opened in the morning, the September contract was 1,642 yuan, which rose by 17 yuan, the October contract was 1,661 yuan, the spread was good by 10 yuan, and the November contract was 1,675 yuan, up 7.5 yuan. Afterwards, the fluctuations were uncertain, with a slight downward trend. The noon closing price for near and far contracts rose by 7 to 12 yuan. In the afternoon, the buying was even more intense as each gang strengthened its search, and the factory orders and the exchange continued to rise, which made buyers even more excited. Therefore, the September contract once rose to 1,650 yuan, the October contract rose to 1,673 yuan, and the November contract rose to 1,690.5 yuan. When the market closed, the shape softened, and the September contract closed at 1,640 yuan, the October contract was 1,671.5 yuan, and the November contract was 1,693 yuan, each rising by 15 yuan to 25.5 yuan. Considering the stability of the yarn prices in each market, if there are no special changes in the environment, I am afraid that the futures yarn will continue to rise. The list is shown below.

### Waiting for Foreign Exchange Method: Foreign Cotton Transactions Stalled; 1,500 Pieces of Indian Cotton Arrived

Yesterday was the first day that the Shanghai port foreign cotton exchange implemented the suppression of the black market for foreign exchange. All Allied banks completely stopped supplying all foreign exchange. Therefore, although all parties were still enthusiastic about ordering foreign cotton, they could only wait for the announcement of concrete measures in the future because they could not obtain U.S. dollars. It depends on whether banks can still have a black market, or directly apply for standard foreign exchange to determine whether to stay or leave. It is expected that the event is very important, and if it is not resolved, it will affect the future of various businesses in Shanghai. Therefore, there may be a clear regulation within two or three days. More cotton has arrived in port. Jardine Matheson's Taisheng Wheel arrived in Shanghai the other day (the 7th), carrying 1,510 pieces of Indian cotton from Hong Kong, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. The Indian cotton was transported to Hong Kong by the Karachi, and then transferred to Shanghai.

The current situation of spot cotton is good again. On the one hand, foreign cotton is not loose but tight, and on the other hand, the yarn market is rebounding, which makes people's hearts strong, and the market is recovering.

American Pengan, Singapore 522.0 100 pieces Same industry

Lan 338.0 200 pieces Again

Again 337.0 100 pieces Again

Huoji 190.0 200 bags Again

### Finance: Foreign Banks Stop Supplying Black Exchange

Dark Market in a State of Stagnation

Yesterday's foreign exchange market, the central and HSBC listings were flat, and the U.S. bank's small counters stopped quoting, causing the dark market for British and American exchange to fall into a state of stagnation again. As a result of the Hong Kong stabilization meeting, the 14 banks in this city stopped buying and selling black market exchange for all but legitimate commercial settlements. Chinese speculators could not get started, so the market in the future will be bought and sold by exporters and importers of non-essential goods with a median price. According to a certain Chinese broker, most of the transactions still have to be brokered by brokers to find a counterparty. Foreign trade is actually barter. The market price yesterday was always British gold at two pence eight five nine three seven five, and U.S. dollars at four yuan eight four three seven five. No transactions were heard all day.

Hong Kong Exchange Market Stagnant

Hong Kong, 8th (Monday) Electrical Dispatch: The exchange market opened stagnant this morning. Shanghai exchange and Japanese exchange have not yet opened. There is a market without a transaction. The rest also has no ups and downs.

Tianjin British Slack, American Flat

Tianjin, 8th (Monday) Electrical Dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. London telegraphic transfer slack 0.03125, for three pence two eight one two five. New York telegraphic transfer still stands at 5.5 yuan. Shanghai exchange rose by 0.5 yuan, for 87.5 yuan. The "Joint Note" dark market rose by 0.25 yuan, for 52 yuan.

### Hong Kong Gang Searched for Cash, Soaring by 150 Yuan

Yesterday's gold market was hot, and the futures market initially changed little, trading all day around 6,880 yuan, only 15 yuan high or low, with a transaction volume of about 1,000 taels. This was due to the stable black market for foreign exchange. Cash suddenly turned up sharply. It was the Hong Kong gang who suddenly searched for it. Transactions were quite brisk. Starting in the morning, Xianghe bought from Yongfeng for 10 taels for 9,060 yuan, which was raised by 20 yuan. Then, his father bought 70 taels from Yifeng, and Chengji 10 taels, Fukang Yong 10 taels, for 9,080 yuan. Yifeng sold 30 taels to Xinyuan at the same price. Xianghe bought another 10 taels from Hesheng, and 40 taels from Xiangxing Yong, all at 9,090 yuan. Gonghe and Wanfeng each sold 10 taels to Tianyuan for 9,100 yuan. Xianghe then bought 10 taels from Yifeng, rising to 9,120 yuan. At noon, there were sellers at the above price. In the afternoon, Dingsheng first came to sell, selling slightly to 9,100 yuan, selling 10 taels to Shunyuan for 9,090 yuan. The securities firm Defu suddenly came to sell, and the rising wind rekindled, buying 10 taels from Shunyuan for 9,100 yuan, and another 200 taels from Yifeng, and 50 taels from Xianghe, for 9,120 yuan. Then he bought another 10 taels from Yifeng, and then he bought 20 taels each from Dafeng and Xianghe, and then he sold 50 taels to Decheng, the price of which was 9,130 yuan. Unexpectedly, Defu suddenly came to buy forcefully again, and the rising wind rose again, 20 taels from Huailianxing, for 9,200 yuan, and then bought 10 taels from Xianghe, rising to 9,210 yuan. Later, Xianghe continued to come and sell again, dropping by 50 yuan, selling 10 taels to Chengji for 9,160 yuan, and finally selling 10 taels to Dafeng, for 9,190 yuan, rising by 150 yuan. The high and low on the day were also 150 yuan, with a transaction volume of more than 700 taels. Jewelry gold also hung up 10 yuan, reaching 940 yuan.

### Securities: Divergent Movement in Domestic Bonds, Shifting from Class A & B to C & E, Debut of China Cotton Mill Stocks

The over-the-counter market for government bonds continued to strengthen yesterday. Major players continued to buy, and short sellers slightly covered their positions. The market remained consistently firm, with Class A and B bonds experiencing slight weakness due to some investors selling them. Consequently, investors shifted from Class A and B to Class C and E bonds, leading to a slight abnormal trend. The upward trend reflected strong investor confidence. Tight credit conditions eased, and foreign interbank lending rates decreased. There were no news events favoring short sellers. Yesterday morning, Class C bonds opened at one yuan, rising to one yuan and five fen. This was initially driven by purchases from E-Tye, Jih-Tai, Jien-The, Chung Foo, and Chung-Yi. Later, sales from The-Foo, Tung-Kang, Ta-Hua, and Lien-Ho caused a slight retracement. In the afternoon, Heng-Kang and Sin-Foo bought Class C and E while selling Class A and B. Hsieh-Hsing-Yuan slightly increased purchases, and Yun-The added positions. Hung-Ta also made purchases, while E-Tye slightly re-emerged. The number 41 brokerage sold Class C and E, and Tung-Kang sold Class A and C. Demand remained strongest for Class C bonds. As a result, Class A and B bonds were down one and a half to two jiao, while Class C and E bonds were up three jiao to one jiao. Class D bonds remained unchanged. The total turnover was approximately one million eight hundred ninety thousand yuan. A summary table is listed below:

In stock trading, fifty shares of Chung-Hua Book Company stock were traded at a price of seventy-two yuan and five jiao.

The stock market at the General Chamber of Commerce was active, with opening prices higher than the previous close. However, heavy selling pressure prevented prices from continuing to rise. After a brief softening, the market stabilized again. China Cotton Mill stocks made their debut, with 140,000 shares traded. The price fluctuated between fourteen yuan one jiao and five jiao.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Speculators Greatly Elated

Yesterday, the sugar market was filled with eager buyers and speculators, as rumors circulated that the supply of black market foreign exchange might be halted. Prices rose across the board by varying amounts of three, four, or five yuan. For forward contracts, Tai-Koo offered 3,000 bags of "Ho Choh Pak" (è·ç²ç½) to be shipped in October/November at a price of US$4.235. The association's spot market saw 131.5 yuan for "Er-Si Hoh Choh Pak" (äºåç²ç½) for August import, which rose to 131.8 yuan and 134 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 4.9 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Further Reduction in Electricity Supply, Cotton Cloth Speculators Re-emerge, Significant Shipments of Piece Goods Southward

Factory cloth: Yesterday's market trend was firm and rising. Cloth prices rose across the board due to rumors of a further 10% reduction in electricity supply and other positive news. Speculators were eager to buy, and holders took the opportunity to push up prices. As a result, white cloth, coarse and fine cloth, and twill cloth increased by five jiao to seven and a half jiao per piece, while bleached and dyed cloth rose by five jiao to one yuan.

### Sundries: Difficulties in Distributing Cigarettes to Outlying Areas, Market Prices Increase Again

Cigarette Market: Yesterday, buying interest tightened again. The factory's distribution of goods to wholesalers in outlying areas requires prior proof of preparation ("æ¬åºè­"), granting them distribution rights. Consequently, everyone believes that future supplies are bound to decrease, causing panic. Holders are driving up prices, and the market is attempting further gains. Big English brand (å¤§è±ç) cigarettes traded at 2,330 yuan per case, up 50 yuan from the previous day.

### Allied Banks No Longer Engaging in Black Market Operations, Shanghai's Foreign Exchange Black Market Eliminated, Stabilization Fund Cables Order to Cease Listing, Regulations for Supplying Legal Foreign Exchange Promulgated, Exporters' Foreign Exchange Bills Limited to Sale to Fourteen Designated Banks

Fourteen Allied banks in Shanghai, including Mercantile, HSBC, Citibank, Chase, Chartered, American Express, Tong-Tze-Lung, Netherlands, Anda, Moscow Narodny, and Sassoon (three companies), having been ordered by the Stabilization Fund on September 6th to supply foreign exchange for essential imports at newly regulated prices, received another cable order yesterday from the U.S. Embassy's Stabilization Fund Committee to uniformly cease listing black market exchange rates. Therefore, the Shanghai foreign exchange black market, which the authorities were determined to eliminate, abruptly disappeared yesterday morning due to the cooperation of the banks. These fourteen Allied banks, operating under the asset freeze orders from the UK, US, and Netherlands affecting Japanese and Chinese funds, agreed to the Stabilization Fund's measures and will no longer engage directly or indirectly in black market transactions. Yesterday's exchange rates quoted by these banks were the preferential rates stipulated by the Stabilization Fund, less the banks' commission. This amounted to US$5.165 yuan, or US$5.3125 yuan, and 18.82 yuan per US dollar, with British Pounds at three pence and one five six two five.

Two Governments Urge Cooperation

According to authoritative sources in the banking sector, the cessation of black market trading by foreign banks in Shanghai yesterday was the result of formal advice from the British and American governments to their respective banks in the Far East to fully cooperate with the Stabilization Fund Committee. When the asset freeze orders were first issued, some foreign banks in Shanghai, holding special licenses, continued to engage in black market foreign exchange trading, leading to the persistence of black market speculative activities. This announcement of the cessation of black market trading will eliminate overt speculation. Foreign exchange for legitimate import trade can be obtained from designated banks, who will apply to the Stabilization Fund Committee on behalf of importers and supply it at the new exchange rate. Goods prohibited from import, unable to secure the necessary foreign exchange, may face complete cessation. This measure will naturally help to adjust Shanghai's trade deficit.

Goods for Foreign Exchange Settlement Classified into Two Categories

Yesterday morning, the Stabilization Fund notified the fourteen Shanghai banks holding foreign exchange business licenses that the Fund would supply the Shanghai foreign exchange market at regulated prices to maintain large-scale legitimate import trade. Goods eligible for this low-priced foreign exchange are divided into two categories. Category A includes food grains purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council, mineral oil products such as gasoline, tobacco leaves, and coal. Category B includes a wide range of goods, some of which were listed on the 1939 list of prohibited imports. The most important items in Category B are cotton, ramie, electrical and power generation machinery, other machinery, canned food, flour, wheat, chemicals, medicines, indigo dyes, newsprint, leather, rubber, automobiles, wheels, rubber tires, photographic and film materials, and others. Among the above-mentioned Category A and B goods, gasoline, tobacco leaves, ramie, and canned food were all on the 1939 prohibited import list published by Customs. The Stabilization Fund's approval of their import and supply of preferential foreign exchange is likely due to consideration of market needs. Similarly, while automobiles, wheels, rubber tires, photographic and film materials are not on the list of goods approved for import by the Executive Yuan, the Stabilization Fund's inclusion of them in the category of goods for which foreign exchange settlement is required serves the same purpose.

Monthly Limits on Foreign Exchange Supply

The Stabilization Fund will approve the supply of preferential British pounds or US dollars for the above-mentioned Categories A and B goods, but the amount supplied is not unlimited and will be allocated on a quota basis. The Stabilization Fund will set a monthly foreign exchange settlement quota for each approved import item, and will refuse to supply foreign exchange beyond that quota. For example, if the monthly foreign exchange settlement quota for food grains is set at one million US dollars, all importers applying for foreign exchange for food grains will be allocated a share of this amount. Once the total quota has been exhausted, the supply will be suspended. This indicates that the Stabilization Fund may not approve import merchants' applications for foreign exchange in full, but will determine the amount based on the stipulated quota. Importers wishing to apply to the Stabilization Fund for foreign exchange must first complete the shipping arrangements and export procedures in the country of origin of the goods, and then prepare the equivalent value in legal tender to apply to the Stabilization Fund for the required foreign exchange. The supply of funds is not contingent on prior approval, but rather on the completion of all procedures. The Stabilization Fund may also approve the supply of foreign exchange for insurance and shipping costs, calculated in foreign currency, related to imported goods.

Foreign Exchange Settlement Also Approved for Small-Scale Trade

For imported goods not included in the above-mentioned Categories A and B, and whose scope is smaller, with a total monthly value not exceeding US$2,000, the Stabilization Fund Committee may supply the required foreign exchange at its discretion, considering the actual situation. However, this must first be approved by the Chinese government. For personal needs, such as overseas remittances for insurance premiums, the Stabilization Fund will also approve foreign exchange as long as the total amount does not exceed US$200 per person per month. Regarding foreign exchange expenses for Chinese students studying abroad, according to the regulations of the Executive Yuan, during the war period, publicly funded students not approved for dispatch will be temporarily suspended. Privately funded students who have scholarships or other foreign exchange subsidies sufficient to cover all expenses during their studies and do not need to purchase foreign exchange will be temporarily suspended from going abroad. Publicly funded students already abroad, if studying sciences related to national defense, will have their tuition, living expenses, and travel expenses covered by foreign exchange, but this must be verified by the Ministry of Education. Students ordered to return to China who fail to do so within the stipulated time will no longer receive foreign exchange notices. All foreign exchange payments to overseas students will be purchased by the Ministry of Education from the Stabilization Fund, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance. All fourteen Allied banks have stated their willingness to comply with the regulations of the Stabilization Fund to ensure that foreign exchange settlement procedures are standardized. If the Stabilization Fund approves the foreign exchange, but the bank finds the original application inconsistent with regulations, the bank handling the transaction must be responsible for repaying the supplied foreign exchange to the Stabilization Fund.

Export Bills Not Allowed for Open Sale

On the other hand, the issue of export foreign exchange settlement has long been a matter of urgency for the Stabilization Fund authorities. In the current situation in Shanghai, export settlements cannot be handled by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. As a result, exporters freely sell their foreign exchange earnings on the black market, contributing to the difficulty of eliminating the black market. Recognizing this, the authorities have decided that when goods are transshipped from other ports for export from Shanghai, the foreign exchange must be settled at the original port of export. However, for local Shanghai goods exported directly, there has been no way to resolve this. Now, the Stabilization Fund Committee, with the cooperation of the relevant banks, has found a solution. Shanghai merchants who obtain foreign exchange from the Stabilization Fund for imports must sell the foreign exchange earned from their exports to any one of the fourteen banks at the Stabilization Fund's price. If they sell it elsewhere (or on the black market), the Stabilization Fund will stop supplying that merchant with new foreign exchange for import trade as a penalty, whether the application is direct or indirect. However, this does not apply to native goods transshipped through Shanghai for export that have already been settled at the original port of export. The Stabilization Fund's measure regarding export foreign exchange settlement is clearly aimed at preventing exporters from selling their foreign exchange earnings on the black market, which fuels its proliferation. If export settlements are entirely controlled by the fourteen banks, and sellers on the black market disappear, the import trade of non-essential goods, which relies on selling foreign exchange on the black market for its survival, will suffer a severe blow.

Four Banks Have Not Yet Received Orders

According to a reliable source contacted by the New Life News Agency yesterday, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and Central Trust of China had not yet received orders from their head offices regarding foreign exchange settlements for essential goods and the cessation of black market trading. However, regardless, the four banks will take the same steps as the other fourteen Allied banks to complete the Stabilization Fund Committee's mission of maintaining legitimate trade and eliminating black market speculation. It is understood that the orders for the four banks will arrive within days and will be implemented immediately upon arrival. As for the application forms for banks to clear foreign exchange on behalf of customers with the Stabilization Fund, the content has been seen in previous reports. Relevant banks are currently rushing to print large quantities of these forms and will distribute them to import merchants so they can apply for essential foreign exchange according to the Stabilization Fund's regulations. These application forms should be printed by tomorrow.

Black Market Had No Basis Yesterday

According to market sources, the black market foreign exchange had no trading activity yesterday because foreign banks had ceased trading, and the phenomenon was that of a market without trades. Bank selling prices consistently remained steady at 2.859375 pence and 4.84375 yuan. The above prices were the same as last Saturday's. The morning close was unchanged, and there was no change at the afternoon opening. Consequently, the gold market was unusually sluggish, and prices were stagnant. This cannot be resolved until there is a suitable solution for the black market foreign exchange. The recently adopted method by the gold futures black market of settling futures gold prices based on commercial exchange rates and implied black market exchange rates has also suffered a severe blow.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Fuel Committee Conducting Fuel Negotiations, Possible Slight Fluctuations in Coal Prices This Winter, No Need to Panic if There Are No Speculators Manipulating the Market

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Fuel Committee is constantly discussing with the Japanese side to increase the amount of fuel imported into Shanghai. At the same time, the police authorities are also working to prevent general coal merchants from monopolizing and hoarding. According to importers of coal into Shanghai, the arrival of coal in Shanghai has not decreased. The main reasons for the high coal prices are the current war, the tense situation in the Pacific, and the anxiety caused by speculators.

Electricity Conservation Measures Still Need Improvement

Since the Shanghai coal industry is not subject to control, general coal merchants can easily hoard coal in Pudong and other places to wait for a good price. The Shanghai Municipal Council has not been able to control the selling price of coal but is trying its best to alleviate the coal problem. Those hoarding coal are mostly general merchants and factories. The Shanghai Power Company is currently being supplied with 25,000 tons of coal per month by a certain factory but hopes to increase this by another 25,000 tons to improve the electricity conservation problem.

Coal Negotiations Gradually Becoming Smoother

The negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Power Company with foreign merchants are expected to gradually become smoother in the future, but the date of realization is unknown. In short, although there may be very slight fluctuations in coal prices in Shanghai this winter, the people of Shanghai do not need to panic. Coal prices will rise and fall with the situation, just like ordinary commodities. It will be difficult to normalize coal prices until the overall situation improves. The Shanghai Municipal Council and its Fuel Subcommittee are currently doing their best to reduce the difficulties of coal users this winter and expect to decide on a suitable solution soon. It is hoped that all sectors will report any coal merchants hoarding for profit to the Shanghai Municipal Council for sanctions.

### Today is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Memorial Day, Launching a Drive to Collect Winter Clothing, Promoting Frugality and Savings Deposits

Today is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Memorial Day, commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's initial decision to launch an uprising, as well as the combined anniversaries of his capture in London and Guangzhou. All sectors remember Dr. Sun Yat-sen's creation of the Republic of China, overthrow of the imperial system, and his great revolutionary achievements, and unanimously commemorate in silence. In view of the imminent arrival of winter, they have decided to launch a drive to collect winter clothing to benefit refugees. At the same time, they will continue to promote the movement of frugality and savings deposits to save material resources.

### Former Philippine Congressman Visiting Shanghai, Studying Trade with China, This Trip is Highly Important

Former Philippine Congressman Eleuterio Frivaldo and his brother Vicente Frivaldo (Vicente is the Manager of the Philippine President's Far East Industries Company) have come to Shanghai by boat to understand the Chinese commercial and trade situation. They will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then travel to Kunming, Guiyang, Chongqing, and other places in the interior of China via Hong Kong to strengthen trade organizations with China. As China and the Philippines are improving diplomatic relations, the Frivaldo brothers' visit to Shanghai is highly important.

### Manager of Fuyuan Money Shop, Ma Yuelou, Reported Kidnapped Yesterday, Abducted on Gansu Road Yesterday Morning

Yesterday morning, another kidnapping case occurred in the International Settlement. The victim was Ma Yuelou, a shareholder and manager of Fuyuan Money Shop, from Zhenjiang, aged 53. He is currently a shareholder and manager of Fuyuan Money Shop in Ruyi Lane, Henan Road, and resides at No. 27 Rehe Road in Shanghai. His wife is deceased, and his son, Jiaqin (33 years old), is employed in the clearing department of the Shanghai Bank on Ningbo Road. Ma usually has his own private car, driven by Xu A'san from Taixian. Yesterday morning, at around 9:00 a.m., Ma left home in his private car. Unexpectedly, when the car reached the intersection of Gansu Road and Rue Albert, three kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Two were wearing Western suits, and one was wearing Chinese clothing. They stopped the car with guns, dragged Ma out of the car, and forced him into a small black-plated car that was parked by the side of the road. The car drove away without a trace. Afterwards, Xu A'san reported the situation to the police. The Hongkou Hui-Shi police station received the report and immediately dispatched detectives to investigate and ordered a search for Ma's whereabouts. However, as of the press deadline, there was still no news. One theory is that the kidnappers came in a car and stopped the car when it encountered Ma's car to carry out the kidnapping. Because the driver, Xu A'san, was terrified, he could not clearly identify the license plate number of the car.

### Boiled Water Industry Demands Water Fee Reduction, Petitioned Yesterday to the Two Water Companies, Instructed to Negotiate with Authorities

The Shanghai Boiled Water Industry Association, in order to reduce the burden on its members, requested the British and French water companies to reduce water fees or change the calculation method. Yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., it appointed Zhang Delong, Ji Jianming, Ye Hanjun, Shi Xingli, Qiu Tingsen, Su Zhixiang, Jin Linsheng, and Han Jingquan to deliver a letter to the British Water Company, requesting that they consider the livelihood of ordinary people and social security and approve a reduction in water fees to reduce the cost of the industry. In the afternoon at 2:00 p.m., the committee members also took a letter to the French Water Company with the same request. The results were satisfactory. The two water companies sent representatives to meet with them and instructed the representatives to negotiate with the authorities of the two settlements. If the two authorities approve a reduction in fees, the two companies will abide by the authorities' orders. They also expressed that they were well aware of the relationship between boiled water shops and ordinary people. Now, the Boiled Water Shop Association has decided to follow the established plan and appeal to the two authorities for assistance to quickly change the calculation method, provide a fixed amount of water per month at a fixed price, or specially approve an exemption from additional fees, or calculate the price of water for the boiled water industry on an equal basis with the price of water for household users.

### More Than 200 Vietnamese Soldiers Arrive in Shanghai to Increase Defense, Arrived and Landed on the Bena Saint-Quentin Yesterday Morning

A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency learned yesterday from reliable sources that 274 Vietnamese soldiers from French Indochina arrived in Shanghai on the French Shipping Company's Bena Saint-Quentin at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. The ship docked at Wharf 11 and 12 on the Huangpu River and then took the company's small ferry across the river to the Customs wharf to disembark. It is believed that the Vietnamese soldiers came to Shanghai to strengthen the defense in the French Concession.

### Gu'aotou Approved for Navigation, Limited to Registered Ships, Shipping Companies Preparing to Join Service

The Gu'aotou shipping route in eastern Zhejiang Province, after the British company Da Li Wheel took the lead in the trial voyage, was followed by the American company Da Xin Wheel. The latter ship ran aground in the Zhoushan waters due to a hurricane, resulting in an incomplete voyage. According to shipping industry news yesterday, since the important ports of Zhejiang Province have either fallen or been ordered to be blockaded, the Shanghai-Zhejiang shipping route has been interrupted for several months. Freight transport cannot be smoothed out, and there is an extreme lack of various necessities in the interior. Since Aojiang Port is not on the blockade list, and in order to meet the current needs and allow a portion of the necessities to flow into the interior, foreign ships have been approved to transport goods to Gu'aotou. However, incoming and outgoing ships are limited to those that were previously registered with the Wenzhou authorities. All cargo must be inspected at designated locations. Currently, shipping companies in Shanghai are preparing to join the service. However, the Jianghai Customs has not yet lifted the ban on customs clearance for the route, and shipping companies are trying to dredge the situation in order to be successful.

### Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund: Industry and Commerce Group Successfully Concluded - Understanding the Principles of Respect for Work and Enjoyment of Profession - Proficiency Comes from Diligence, Not Neglect

Since the 22nd of August, after our newspaper successfully completed the student scholarship program, we continued to run the supplementary education scholarship program for industrial and commercial employees. Over the past 17 days, we have now fully completed all procedures, including registering, investigating, reviewing, announcing, and issuing scholarships to over a thousand applicants. Our colleagues, mindful of the great trust placed in us by the gentlemen and ladies who donated to the readers' scholarship fund, have been constantly striving to live up to their expectations, hoping not to betray the original intention and enthusiasm of the readers who contributed. Now, on the day of announcing the approved list and concluding the program, we would like to say a few words to the industrial and commercial employees who received the scholarships, and also seek correction from all sectors of society.

You are engaged in the industrial and commercial sectors, which are the cornerstone of the social and economic fortress. Supplementing knowledge and studying technology are essential for industrial and commercial employees today. However, there must be a clear understanding, namely "respect for work and enjoyment of profession." Your diligent pursuit of knowledge should aim at developing your own profession. Proficiency comes from diligence, while neglect leads to failure. Your ability to put aside the current indulgence in feasting and drinking and engage in active learning sets a good example and will surely sow good seeds for the future of industry and commerce. If this can be promoted and carried forward to reverse the current decline, the readers who donated will be able to fulfill their long-cherished wishes, and the firms where you work will also benefit from increased service efficiency. Benefiting oneself and benefiting others, helping oneself and being helped by others, you will not only be worthy of the enthusiastic assistance of society, but also have done your utmost for society and your profession.

Furthermore, supplementary education in spare time is originally a matter of each individual's active pursuit of knowledge. Many of you may have faced difficulties in your early years of study, but throughout history, saints, sages, and heroes have all come from adversity. Your ability to encourage yourselves today will surely lead you to deeply believe that the hardships you have endured are the inevitable path to future success. The more difficult, the more training; the more hardship, the more struggle. As the saying goes, "Only those who persevere can succeed," and "Constant dripping wears away the stone." We sincerely hope that you will persevere throughout the course of your supplementary studies. The day you complete your studies will also be the time when we can report to society with satisfaction.

Yesterday, in the "Spring and Autumn" column of this newspaper, an anonymous old man respectfully addressed the students selected for the scholarship, saying, "Studying hard under the moonlight, without warm clothing in winter, running a book stall for twenty years, with meager surpluses, all used to run charities." The old man also generously donated two thousand yuan to our newspaper's scholarship program. Seeing the old man's sincere encouragement, you should know that the scholarship opportunity you have received today, every single bit of it, is given by the noble and invaluable enthusiasm of people from all walks of life. We hope that you will uphold this spirit, constantly strive for self-improvement, and repay the great kindness of all sectors of society in supporting education. Written in haste, we sincerely express our gratitude and extend our deepest thanks to all enthusiastic supporters of education.

### Japanese Nationals Evacuated from the Philippines Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning - A Total of 340 People

The French postal steamer "Bana Saint Therapia" arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 a.m. yesterday after sailing from Manila and docked at Pujiang Floating Pontoon Numbers 11 and 12. In addition to carrying 2,500 tons of coal, the ship also carried 340 Japanese nationals who had been residing in various parts of Southeast Asia and had gathered in the Philippines to evacuate to Shanghai. This group of Japanese nationals disembarked at the Customs Wharf at 9:30 a.m. yesterday. It is estimated that they will stay in Shanghai for several days before returning to Japan by ship. It is reported that these Japanese nationals have been affected by the freezing of funds by the United States and the United Kingdom, which has forced the closure of their shops in various parts of Southeast Asia. It is said that a larger number of businessmen and industrialists will be evacuated to Shanghai and then return to Japan.

### Rumor of President Lines Moving to the Philippines Denied - Company Employees Going to the Philippines are Personnel Transfers

The rumor spread by the Japanese Domei News Agency that the Shanghai Eastern General Office of the American President Lines would be moved to Manila, leaving only a small number of essential staff in Shanghai to handle business, has been denied by an employee of the company. According to him, the recent departure of American President Lines employees from Shanghai to Manila on the President Garfield was only a temporary assignment. The Manila office lacked personnel, so the company management found it appropriate to send some employees to assist in the office. Once their task is completed, they will return to work in Shanghai. According to a Domei News Agency dispatch from Manila, the American President Lines has decided to move its Eastern General Office from Shanghai to Manila, and several employees of the Shanghai General Office have already arrived in Manila.

### Dispute at the Huishan Police Station the Day Before Yesterday - A Misunderstanding

The "North China Daily News" reported that a Western police officer from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department had a dispute with a Japanese person at the Huishan Police Station late last night (the 7th). It is understood that the matter arose from a misunderstanding. The appearance of several Japanese Navy Marine Corps soldiers in the police station led to speculation among the Chinese. However, the police claimed that it was common for Japanese people other than Japanese police officers to come to the police station. It is said that the Japanese soldiers soon left the Huishan Police Station. It was later confirmed that the Western police officer involved in the dispute had been taken away from the police station by the Japanese. It is said that the superintendent in charge of the Huishan district, Barre, and a senior police officer, both went to the Huishan Police Station to inquire about the matter.

### Old Couple Divorces, Daughter Commits Suicide - Old Woman Has Affair, Daughter Dies of Shame

Zhao Jingzhai, also known as Zhao Desheng, a native of Linhai, Zhejiang, is 61 years old. He used to work at Jardine Matheson & Co. He married a Cantonese woman, Ms. Ding (49 years old this year), many years ago, and they have several children. They currently reside in a pavilion room on the second floor of the Mintian Rice Shop at No. 9 Malong Road in the French Concession. Their eldest daughter, Biyu, is 21 years old and is studying obstetrics at the Tongde Medical College on Tongfu Road.

Zhao's wife, Ms. Ding,

Although old, is still very flirtatious. Not content at home, she has an affair with the owner of the rice shop. Recently, Zhao discovered this and there was a major dispute. The couple even decided to divorce. The eldest daughter, Biyu, bitterly advised her mother, but she would not listen. Zhao and his wife agreed on the divorce terms: Ms. Ding would compensate Zhao for 1,000 yuan in losses, and all children would be raised and married by Zhao. Both parties then signed a

Divorce Agreement

on the afternoon of the 7th at a lawyer's office.

Afterwards, the children should follow their father. The eldest daughter, Biyu, went home to pack her clothes, intending to go to her father's. Ms. Ding tried to persuade Biyu to stay with her, but the daughter insisted on not doing so. Mother and daughter had a fierce quarrel. At this point, the daughter had a suicidal thought and immediately took poison. By the time her mother discovered this, it was too late to save her, and she died. After the incident, Zhao and Ms. Ding reported to the police, saying that

Their daughter, Biyu,

had failed her studies and was held back a grade, and had committed suicide out of resentment. The police sent investigators to investigate, but the accounts varied. They then summoned the deceased's parents and the rice shop owner to the police station for questioning and took the body to the coroner's office. Yesterday, the deceased's father, Zhao Jingzhai, claimed the body for burial.

### Woman Takes Poison and Jumps into the Huangpu River

At around 10:30 p.m. last night, a fashionable woman named Huang Zhen, 32 years old, from Jiangsu, jumped into the Huangpu River at the Bund Park. It is not known why she had thoughts of death. She first drank a large dose of poison, and then jumped into the river to kill herself. Fortunately, Patrolman No. 9090 of the Central Police Station managed to rescue her and take her to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, she had lost consciousness and her life was in danger.

### Cheng Ji Watercolor Exhibition

The Cheng Ji Watercolor Exhibition, which opened on September 1st, has lasted for over a week. Viewers have praised it highly. The exhibits are mostly urban landscapes and social dynamics of Shanghai. Many works are masterpieces, and most have been purchased by knowledgeable people. It is a grand occasion rarely seen since the Western porcelain exhibitions of recent years. Works such as No. 3 "Road Builder," No. 77 "Street Cleaner," No. 58 "Ship," No. 11 "International Hotel," and No. 5 "Jiangxi Road" have been highly appreciated by Western visitors. Masterpieces such as "Golden Flower," which is light and refined, and "Red Apricot Branch Head Spring Full of Life," which is deeply satirical, are thought-provoking. The exquisite and innovative decoration of each piece is also noteworthy. It is said that the exhibition will end on the 10th, with only today and tomorrow remaining.

### Lockdown at Chengdu Road Intersection Yesterday Morning

At 10 a.m. yesterday morning, a lockdown was suddenly implemented by the police department at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Chengdu Road, at the boundary between the two concessions. Barbed wire fences were erected in the center of the road, and more than 20 armed Chinese and Western detectives were stationed on both sides, selectively searching pedestrians and vehicles that seemed suspicious. The lockdown was lifted at 10:20 a.m. The detailed reasons are unknown.

### Publishing News

The inaugural issue has been published, featuring works by Lin Heqin, Neding, Tao Juyin, Cook, Zhou Lengjia, Gu Mingdao, Chen Yunshang, and others. The retail price of the magazine is 30 cents per copy.

The fourth issue of the "Mainland" monthly magazine has been published. The magazine is a comprehensive magazine with knowledge and interest. The content includes international new knowledge, travel essays, local impressions, professional life, social aspects, historical essays, daily science, medical knowledge, and long novels.

### Absorption of Spiritual Food

â Wu Dai

Spiritual food is very important, but after all, physical food is more fundamental. To put it bluntly, in this era of rising living standards, one can choose not to look at calligraphy and painting, but one cannot choose not to eat. This is undoubtedly an irrefutable truth, but conversely, those who are full are not necessarily aware of the meaning of spiritual food, because everyone is born to be hungry, but the appreciation of spiritual food needs to be educated step by step.

From primitive times to the present, from eating raw food to cooked food, it can be said that the only great progress in human physical food, and looking forward, there does not seem to be any more remarkable developments. However, it is not the case with spiritual food. The invention of writing allowed abstract thoughts to have a permanent record, which can be said to be the beginning of human civilization. Gutenberg's invention of the printing press provided an opportunity for the mass dissemination of writing, and also created a new era for the cultural world. These two major events in the cultural history of spiritual food have promoted the accelerated progress and development of human society. It can be seen that spiritual food occupies an important position in historical evolution.

Food is the first necessity of the people, and no one can oppose this statement. As for refined spiritual food, we believe that at least thought should prioritize spiritual food. In today's civilized society, those who wish to be full all day long and become walking corpses are said to be extremely rare. Unfortunately, however, spiritual food is not something that everyone is born to be able to eat. This requires education and promotion to make the absorption of spiritual food a habit.

### Spider Tactics

â Nong Jian

The "spider," that gray-brown and filthy little creature, whenever we see it, we always feel a bit disgusted, right? But you wouldn't imagine how clever and skillful their tactics are! Now, regardless of whether their tactics are old-fashioned or seem modern, I will briefly describe them here.

Building Bridges

Building bridges is the precursor to marching, so I've included this item as well. How exactly does a spider cross a stream to build its web, or is it just to wave to the other shore? Thomson says, "It stands on a high branch, releases a long strand of silk, letting it drift with the wind until it reaches the bushes on the other side. When the spider feels that the silk sac is no longer being pulled, it stops releasing silk; it tightens the strand, making it straight, and firmly ties the end closest to it onto the branch..." - This reminds me of the method used by the Congo natives to build "vine bridges" in the film "Mysterious Congo" that I saw: using an extremely long vine rope tied to the top of a tall tree on one bank, and then sending the person tied to the rope, like swinging on a swing, to the opposite bank of the stream, thus laying the first foundation rope of the vine bridge. Isn't this the same as the spider's actions?

Setting Traps

Some spiders can densely weave a layer of web in the gaps of walls or depressions in the ground, making it form the same plane as the wall or the ground: unaware and forced insects accidentally crawl over it and are firmly caught by the mucus or ropes on the web. The "Wubei Zhi" compiled by Mao Yuanyi of the Ming Dynasty states the following regarding "Pitfall Traps": "Dig a pit in the soil, five feet long, three or four feet wide and deep...Cover it with hay or plant seedlings, so that the enemy is completely unaware..." I think this kind of plan is no different from the spider's wisdom.

Air Defense

Speaking of air defense, we humans should truly feel ashamed and sigh that we are far inferior to spiders! Look at the various and colorful webs that spiders weave! Horizontal, vertical, inclined, square, round, triangular; in the corners of walls, on flower branches, eaves, windows, visible everywhere. What bold mosquitoes and flies dare to fly recklessly without being immediately unlucky and firmly captured? - I believe that humans take inspiration from spiders when they create nets to ambush birds and beasts in forests and thickets; can't we one day scatter thousands and hundreds of iron nets in the sky above large cities to block or capture invading enemy planes?

Submerging

Thomson also said that there is a type of spider that can make an airtight net in the water, filling it with dry air, and then swim freely, like a "diving bell." - Unexpectedly, small-scale submarines can also be found in this humble animal!

Shooting

There is a unique spider in Australia called the "Magnificent Spider." It likes to eat moths but does not spin webs; it spins a long line with a drop of extremely sticky substance attached to the end; it uses a front leg to suspend the line - "as if using a fishing rod to suspend the line" - when a moth passes by, it quickly swings the line; the glue drop is extremely sticky, and once a moth touches it, it cannot escape. Moreover, its skill is extremely high, sometimes capturing the moth with one or two swings: - There is a similar spider in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, but its long line spins non-stop. - This can truly be called a sharpshooter.

Scoop Catching

Thomson also said: In Argentina, there is a type of spider that can build a funnel-shaped net by the shallow water; it can drive tadpoles into its net, and then take them for food. - I think this is very similar to the cast nets used by fishermen, and it cannot be said that it is not a special tactic of the spider.

### Begonia

â Qin Shouou

12. Unexpected Turmoil

That night, he and Begonia discussed the matter for the entire night because he was more familiar with the roads in the city than she was. They decided that he would follow Chen Da into the city to investigate carefully.

"You can't bring too little money!" When he was about to leave, Begonia gave him twenty dollars, but he insisted on only taking five. Begonia automatically stuffed the rest into his pocket. "Little Gouzi, I know your loyalty! But as the saying goes, nothing in the world can be done without money. You should still take it with you! As long as we can find the young lady sooner, I'm willing to spend more money."

Little Gouzi blushed and hid the four banknotes.

"Don't worry! Sir, if I, Little Gouzi, can't find the young lady, I won't see you again in this lifetime!" He tightened the cloth belt around his waist, stood in the cold wind, his body as straight as a bamboo pole, his face without a smile, his sleeves rolled up high, constantly glancing at the Meng family shop across the street, looking as if he was about to fight the Meng family shop owner.

"Fortunately, a letter has also been sent from the school to the county. Maybe they've already come back," Chen Da said to Begonia with sympathy. "Mr. He should wait for our news at home!"

Begonia forced a smile and nodded to him. (206)

### "Clearance Sale"

â Feile

In New York, there are at least twenty large department stores that hold an "inventory clearance sale" every year. The time is usually three weeks, but it can be shortened to one week if the inventory is cleared. The price reduction is very thorough, substantial, and can even be lower than the cost by more than 25 percent, so most discerning customers flock to it.

The department store owner said: "Clearing inventory can keep a business from falling behind the times."

Indeed, "inventory" and "outdated" are equal, just as two plus two equals four. To avoid being "outdated," you must clear your "inventory."

Today, people's minds need this "clearance"!

Do you feel your head is swelling? Maybe there's too much inventory! I tell you, inventory is what keeps you away from the times, rejecting so many new things. It makes you more and more pedantic, closer and closer to the antique showcase, unless you decide to "clear" it. If every year, every mind could have a "clearance sale," I think the world would be filled with freshness and joy! Not only that, but perhaps the giant wheel of the times would have already advanced to another stage.

### An Old Man in England

â Wang Liang

On a train in Berlin filled with soldiers going to the front lines, stood a hunched old woman, seeing her son off. During the farewell, tears streamed down her wrinkled face; the crowd around her insulted her. Unexpectedly, she solemnly said: "I sent my husband and sons to the battlefield one by one; they sacrificed themselves for the country one by one. Now I am sending off my last son, and I will have no more sons to fight for the country. This makes me even more heartbroken!"

This is a very touching story. The old woman, the protagonist of the story, is certainly immortal, but now she probably cannot claim the exclusive privilege:

In a factory in central England, there is a 75-year-old man operating a heavy press, without anyone's help, and the machine lacks protective devices; it is clearly too dangerous. An inspector, greatly surprised, approached and inquired; he answered in a heavy tone: "That doesn't matter. Installing protective devices would hinder the work; without them, the work can be at least three times faster. My son is now serving in Libya (east of Egypt). He is risking his life; I am only risking my fingers!" At least this old man's request to God seems more active, I think.

War

### Fearless Firefighters

â Kezhong

Under the intense bombing of German planes, the work of London firefighters can be said to be one of the most dangerous in the world. In order to do their job better, these fearless firefighters spare no expense, spending a lot of money and time, engaging in large-scale, long-term hard training. During training, they wear gas masks and rush into houses filled with smoke, both to get used to that stifling environment and to test whether their gas masks are damaged. Their spirit of struggling without fear of difficulties and avoiding trouble is entirely for a greater goal: to save the country from the threat of totalitarianism.

### Jiang Hong, Burying Herself in Diligent Study

â Weiren

I have met Jiang Hong, who plays the Empress Dowager Cixi in "Qing Palace Grievances," several times. We talked about some fragmented issues related to drama. She is very articulate and very amiable. What is recorded in this article is a process of her struggling in acting, that is, a report of her artistic training.

Jiang Hong is nineteen years old this year and is from Suzhou. She grew up in Beiping. Her parents are both alive, and she has an older brother, a younger brother, and a younger sister. In her childhood, she followed her father, running north and south, and had been to many places. She lived in the Henan area for a relatively long time. After the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident occurred, she came to Shanghai with her mother, brother, younger brother, and younger sister, leaving her father alone working in the Ministry of Railways in Chongqing.

She first studied at Qixiu, and later was admitted to Guanghua. This semester, she became a freshman at the university. She is studying in the Department of Political Science.

Her acting began two years ago. After watching Xia Xia's "The Beginning of Man," a classmate once said to her, "Jiang Hong, can you play the role of Xiao Lilian?" She had never acted before, but she boldly replied, "This is a kind of knowledge, and I am willing to try to learn it." So she worked hard in art.

She has guest-starred in plays such as "Working Women," "Boudoir Complaints," "Devastated Life," "Thunderstorm," "A Dog and a Woman," "Debt," and "The Beginning of Man" in drama troupes such as "Zhi Fu," "Gong Hua," "Guanghua," and "Hua Guang." Recently, she played the Empress Dowager Cixi in "Qing Palace Grievances," and became famous in one fell swoop.

Her acting has always been a guest role. She has never joined any drama troupe, and has never received any subsidies or remuneration. She said, "I act because I like acting. Besides pursuing art, I have no other needs." Therefore, she is unwilling to be careless or casual when acting, but is cautious and attentive every step of the way. - The success of the Empress Dowager Cixi is naturally not accidental.

From September 3rd, the sound of the bell drove her from the stage to the classroom. Now she is no longer performing in the Qing Palace. She said, "School has started, I have to study hard. I can't neglect my precious studies for the sake of acting."

Speaking of studying, she is very hardworking. She usually likes to read works by Shakespeare, Ibsen, Shaw, etc., and she has also read a lot of books on drama theory. Among foreign movie stars, she most admires Norma Shearer.

Jiang Hong's acting skills are admired by everyone, and especially her spirit of burying herself in diligent study is truly worthy of being a good model for every artist and every young person!

### After Watching "The Miser"

â LuolÃ¼

This time, Huaxia performed "The Miser."

It truly targets the current society. There are countless people like Hua Binggang, who are greedy and stingy, on this isolated island. "The Miser" is a five-act satirical comedy. Its general idea is about a miser who sees money as his second life - Hua Binggang (i.e., the miser). For money, he hates and suspects everyone, even his own children. He wants to marry Miss Fan, his own son's lover, as his second wife, but because the Fan family is very poor and has no dowry, he comes up with a cunning plan, which is to arrange for his own son to marry a rich widow in order to get a rich dowry. At the same time, because of greed, he agrees to marry his own daughter, Yingmei, to Mr. Fan, a gentleman, as his wife under the condition of "no dowry." But things are not that simple. There are many complicated problems involved, but in the end, Miss Fan marries the son of "The Miser," and Yingmei also marries her lover. As for Hua Binggang himself, as long as he can keep his money, he doesn't care about anything else. The most successful actor is Ou Hua, who plays "The Miser." Ou Hua has always been known for playing old men, and it is most suitable for him to play this stingy old man this time. He portrays the psychology of a "Miser" vividly. Zhang Qiu, who plays Yingde, and Lan Zhi, who plays the matchmaker, are also successful. The remaining Qian Ji, who plays Fan Liqiong, is still competent, Zhang Yong (played by Wang Chen) seems to have some stiff stage steps, Hua Yingmei (Zheng Xiang) can raise her lines a bit, and the rest are fine. It is very difficult for an amateur drama club to have such excellent achievements. Brief News (1) The first anniversary of the Guolian Grand Theater is approaching, and it has been decided to screen "Forever and Ever," a giant film by Yihua.

Chapter Sixteen: Taking the Beloved Bird Out of the Cage Early

Today, the country has reached a critical moment, but those with power do not want to exert their strength, and those with wealth do not want to spend their money. How can we save the country from its difficulties, but only worry about our own safety? This is too selfish. These people also have to suffer! So she feigned saying to Tian Hongyu: "Even the emperor's father-in-law has no way to think, how can we little women have any way? We have to rely on you. When the bandits come, you group of officials should come up with good plans early to put them out so that they don't become difficult to eliminate like weeds. You usually don't know the news in advance, and you don't maintain peace before it happens. When disaster strikes, you can't stand up and share the worries of the court. Isn't this very ashamed?" When Yuanyuan said this, she was extremely sarcastic. Tian Hongyu's face turned red involuntarily, and he sighed and said, "Yuanyuan, are you scolding the civil and military officials in the court? Or are you aiming at the old man? Alas! Your words are so sharp that they leave me with nowhere to stand." Yuandao: "Where dare I say the adults are wrong? I only deeply hate that the general ministers cannot quell the chaos for the country, which has led to the deterioration of the situation day by day. If the bandits enter Beijing, I am prepared to die. If the adults sacrifice themselves for the country, we might as well die together." These words were also Yuanyuan's attempt to test Tian Hongyu's mind. In fact, Yuanyuan may not be prepared to die. Her heart has a different kind of longing. But when Tian Hongyu heard these words, his brows furrowed even tighter. He shook his head and said: "Death is heavier than Mount Tai, and lighter than a feather. If I die like this, although it is to repay the kindness of the emperor, it is too meaningless. I have never held political power. More me may not be a blessing to the court, then if I am not among them, it may not harm the Ming Dynasty, so why should I die? In my twilight years, getting Qing, I thought it was a god-given relationship. I just want to wish that the flowers are always good and the moon is always round, and get along with Qing forever. Why do you talk about death? The old man can't bear to see you die, and he can't bear to abandon these happy days and become a tomb person. Yuanyuan, besides dying, is there no other way?" (163)
