### The European War Will Expand to the Near East: Germany Announces the Red Sea as a War Zone; US Government Declares No Change to Previous Announcement; German-Italian Allied Forces Launch New Offensive on Egyptian Border

Berlin: The German government last night announced the Red Sea as a war zone, warning all ships not to sail through it again, at the risk of being bombed. The Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba in the northern Red Sea are both war zones, prohibiting the passage of all ships, except for Saudi Arabian territorial waters. Pilgrimage ships (i.e., ships carrying Muslims to holy sites) may pass through, but will be subject to special inspections, according to a 14th-day Reuters dispatch. Note that US President Roosevelt recently declared the Red Sea a non-war zone, allowing US ships to sail there (Havas).

Berlin: German sources recently stated that the official announcement of expanding the war zone to the Red Sea is related to intensifying the war in the Mediterranean. However, neutral diplomats believe that Germany's intention is to directly target the United States (14th-day Associated Press dispatch).

Washington: Well-informed sources recently stated that Germany's declaration of the Red Sea as a war zone will not change President Roosevelt's recent announcement allowing US ships to sail in the Red Sea. President Roosevelt believes that it should only be declared a war zone when war has actually broken out in the area. Unless the Germans can control the Red Sea, the area is not considered to be in immediate danger (14th-day Associated Press dispatch).

New York: The Beirut Radio Station reports that a large number of British troops, totaling two divisions, have landed at the port of Haifa in Palestine. There are also hundreds of tanks and a large number of vehicles. These troops are the same ones who previously fought in Greece. Furthermore, travelers from West Africa report that a large British army is concentrated in Freetown (a key port 500 miles south of Dakar). Passengers passing through the port personally witnessed seven troop transport ships and seventy to eighty merchant ships inside the port (14th-day Associated Press dispatch).

London: A Reuters correspondent with a British mobile patrol in the Western Desert cabled that enemy forces attacked on Sunday, seemingly deploying 200 tanks, operating independently and without communication to a supply line. They assume that when it is necessary to establish a supply line in the depths of Egypt, it will not be difficult to establish one. The enemy army advanced towards Egypt in five routes at dawn. They clashed with British forces between Sollum on the coast and Bir Khamsa, fifty miles into the desert to the south. The first route of German troops advanced along the coastal highway towards Bardia, but was blocked by the offensive positions of the British vanguard. Another route descended a slope and turned south, encountering the British vanguard on the coastal plain. The third and fourth routes crossed the Egyptian border west of Sollum. The fifth route attempted to flank the British forces and attack from the south. Dust swirled at the top of the slope, and the two armies were unaware of each other's movements within a few miles, making the battle highly mobile (14th-day Reuters dispatch).

Berlin: German and Italian troops advancing from Sollum along the Egyptian border pushed forward seventy kilometers. The enemy retreated before the fierce attack by the German-Italian forces (14th-day Reuters dispatch).

### US Nationals in the Near East Prepare to Withdraw; Residents Evacuated from Alexandria

Ankara: US nationals in Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt have received notices from their respective consulates to proceed to the Suez Canal, where four American ships are available to evacuate them. This indicates that US nationals in the Near East will soon be completely evacuated (14th-day Reuters dispatch).

Rome: "Il Popolo d'Italia" reported today that civilians in Alexandria have begun to evacuate, with thousands of women and children being sent to safe areas upstream of the Nile (13th-day Havas dispatch).

### Iraq Willing to Accept Turkish Mediation; Presents Ceasefire Conditions; Two Major Points Violate Anglo-Iraqi Treaty; Ankara Feels Success is Unlikely

Water Surrounds Suburbs of Baghdad, Impeding British Advance

Ankara: According to reliable sources, Iraqi government leader Ali Gailani has instructed his Minister of Defense to bring the following conditions for Turkish mediation: (1) British troops landing in Basra must not remain there, but must be transferred to destinations outside of Iraq. (2) Although Ali Gailani agrees to increase the number of British troops stationed in Iraq, he insists that the increased number and how to implement the troop increase must be decided and resolved by a joint Anglo-Iraqi committee. Since these two points contradict the terms of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, Ankara feels that the Iraqi Minister of Defense's visit to Turkey has little chance of success. The Iraqi Embassy in Ankara has refused to comment, except to say that the mission of the Iraqi Minister of Defense has ended. However, the minister is still lingering here for a few days, and it is rumored that he will meet with German Ambassador von Papen to Turkey. Ali Gailani's attempt to declare a holy war against the British has been ridiculed and also violates the will of his own people, since Iraq gained independence with British assistance (14th-day Reuters dispatch).

Cairo: The Iraqi government of Ali Gailani has replied to the Egyptian government, stating that it has received its proposal for mediation and expresses its gratitude. However, the Iraqi government has already accepted Turkish mediation and is now handling the Turkish proposal (14th-day Reuters dispatch).

Beirut: It is reported that yesterday, the suburbs of Baghdad were flooded by order of the Iraqi Commander-in-Chief to impede the British advance (14th-day Reuters dispatch).

### Signs of Strengthened German-Soviet Cooperation

Istanbul: Non-Turkish sources recently pointed out that the return of German Ambassador von Papen to Ankara apparently coincided with the Soviet Union's recognition of the anti-British Iraqi regime, with the intention of getting Turkey to cooperate with the Axis powers. They also stated that Turkey's best response would be for the Turkish Parliament to approve the allocation of 13,500,000 Turkish pounds for national defense. It is believed here that the Soviet Union's recognition of Iraqi anti-British Prime Minister Gailani is sufficient to indicate that Stalin, who is in charge of the Soviet government, has decided to launch a policy of strengthened Soviet-German cooperation. At the same time, unconfirmed reports from Ankara Radio state that two German bombers have arrived at the Mosul oil fields in Iraq (14th-day Associated Press dispatch).

### German Ambassador von Papen Returns to Post; Meets with Turkish Foreign Minister; Rumored to Carry Letter from Hitler; Reassures Turkey of No Aggressive Intentions

Ankara: After returning to Ankara, German Ambassador von Papen held a long meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu yesterday. Political circles here believe that this conversation is of great importance (14th-day Reuters dispatch).

Turkish Capital: The Turkish Nationalist Party held a meeting here today, where Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu reported on the recent situation. Prime Minister Saydam delivered a speech, which was unanimously endorsed by all representatives. It is generally believed here that German Ambassador von Papen's return this time was accompanied by a letter from Führer Hitler, again assuring Turkey that the Axis powers' occupation of the Greek islands near the Dodecanese is only a "symbolic occupation." The troops stationed on the islands have no aggressive power, and the German mechanized forces have already withdrawn from the Balkan Peninsula, with their complete withdrawal being only a matter of time. Germany's demands on Turkey are limited to enhancing bilateral trade relations. Although the situation in Turkey has eased, it is generally expected that the Turkish government will not relax its vigilance in recent months (13th-day Havas dispatch).

### Former Iraqi Prime Minister Dies Suddenly in Syria

Milan: Former Iraqi Prime Minister Hashimi recently died suddenly in Damascus. Hashimi fled Baghdad during the Iraqi coup. He was highly trusted by the British government. Hashimi became Prime Minister in January of this year, which the British government strongly supported (14th-day Reuters dispatch).

### Baghdad Islamic Leader Issues Call for Muslims to Revolt Against the British

New York: The Beirut (Syria) Radio Station broadcast that the Islamic leader of Baghdad issued a call for all Muslims to revolt against the British, "The time for our independence from the British has come!" It is claimed that a rebellion has broken out in the triangle area of Palestine. English families are fleeing south to South Africa, as are wealthy Jews (14th-day Associated Press dispatch).

### Moscow to Hold Air Defense Drill; 150,000 People to Participate

Moscow: A statement here said that a large-scale air defense drill will be held near Moscow tomorrow. No less than 150,000 firefighters will participate, and some police will also join the drill. At that time, there will be a blackout, plunging the entire city into darkness, while "self-defense forces" will search for simulated enemy paratroopers (14th-day Reuters dispatch).

### British and American Ambassadors Visit Japanese Foreign Minister

Tokyo: After Foreign Minister Matsuoka returned to Tokyo from Europe on the 22nd of last month, US Ambassador Grew this morning at 10:20 and British Ambassador Craigie this morning at 11:30 visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the first time. It is believed that they inquired about Japan's attitude towards adjusting relations with Britain and the United States and discussed other issues (14th-day Reuters dispatch).

### Australia and the Dutch East Indies Have Close Ties

Batavia: According to news from Sydney, Australia is paying close attention to the visit of Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens and Colonial Minister Welter. Kleffens stated that he now recognizes that Australia and the Dutch East Indies have close ties, and hopes that this trip will enhance relations between the neighboring countries. The two ministers had a long meeting with Australian Foreign Minister Stewart (10th-day Reuters dispatch). Scene of the Suez Canal

Editorial

### The Flight of German Deputy Führer Hess

The merits and demerits of democratic and dictatorial political systems is an old and much-debated question. Opinions vary, and there is no consensus. Even from the experience of this European war, Germany's internal unity and flexible operation stand in stark contrast to France's litigiousness and slow response. The democratic systems of the United Kingdom and the United States have also proven their resilience under severe testing. An event like the flight of German Deputy Führer Hess to the United Kingdom is unthinkable in a democratic country, and this is a major weakness of dictatorial political systems.

The real reasons and motives for Hess's flight are still unclear, but judging from the National News Agency's announcement, there is no doubt that there are major differences of opinion between him and the current German authorities. The so-called mental disorder and serious illness are clearly deceptive excuses. Until the day of his flight, Hess was always the Deputy Party Leader of the National Socialist Party, Hitler's representative, and second in line to succeed him. In terms of political responsibility, his position was certainly not as prominent as that of Goering or Ribbentrop, but in terms of party organization, no one other than Hitler could compare with him. Germany is in a critical period of war, and such an important position would not be entrusted to a mentally unsound patient for long! Given Hess's power and high status, his personal opinions could not be fully expressed within the party, which led him to flee on his own. This is even more evident for those whose status is not as high as Hess's, and for the general population. It is believed that there are many people in Germany who share the same feelings as Hess, but they do not even have the opportunity to flee abroad. In the past, people often underestimated the organizational capacity of the Nazi Party, as if it would soon collapse due to internal contradictions. After the victory on the Western Front last summer, they overestimated it, and no one placed any hope in the internal affairs of the Nazis. In fact, Hitler's rule is not like a heap of loose sand, nor is it perfect. The authorities strictly control and oppress the people, and the people are afraid of the humiliation and pain of the defeat in the last war, so they maintain integrity and unity on the surface. It is not that the vast majority of Germans who opposed the Nazis until the 1932 elections have now become Hitler's loyal supporters, nor is it that every German now embraces the policy of aggressive militarism. However, the dark side of Germany has begun to be exposed by Hess's flight.

The European war is continuing, and the more the Axis powers gain the upper hand, the more enemies they make, and the wider the war becomes. Therefore, no one dares to predict when and where the war will end. This is certainly a misfortune for the world, but Germany, at the heart of the war, suffers the most. Hitler won a majority of votes in 1933 because he promised the Germans to break free from the shackles of Versailles, so his rearmament of the Rhineland and the recovery of the Saarland were powerful weapons to consolidate his regime. When he annexed Austria and seized Czechoslovakia, he had already gone beyond the scope of seeking to restore national pride, and the people only got the forced exchange of butter for cannons, which even led to the outbreak of a great war that swept across the entire European continent, and openly touted the "New Order" to transform Europe and even the world as the ultimate goal. These things, even if they can stimulate or excite the internal population for a while, are increasingly distant from the original intention of seeking to restore national pride and survival. Even Hitler himself, his recent speeches have been repetitive and lack novelty to appeal to the masses. Moreover, the last great war is not far away, and even with the current victories, recalling the past pain cannot help but cause some painful memories, thereby reducing the longing for the victory touted by Hitler. This recent split may seem on the surface to be a dispute between war and opposition to war, but its essence is the inevitable reaction of those who dream of conquering the world within themselves. This is the inevitable fate of the aggressor, and on the other hand, it is what makes Hess different from Quisling.

However, even if this kind of split exists in Germany, it is not yet mature. Hess's solo flight is proof of this: If this attempt to oppose Hitler had a real chance of success, it would not be Hess who fled abroad, but other figures in the Nazi authorities. Hitler was able to use brutal massacres to suppress the rebellion of the radical faction led by Rohm in 1934, so he will probably use extraordinary means to mend the internal rift this time, although the nature of this rift should not be underestimated.

May 10 last year was the glorious day when the Nazi army began its offensive on the Western Front. This year, this day saw the tragicomedy of the Deputy Führer fleeing to the enemy country. This contrast clearly suggests the trend of the aggressor's rise and decline. If Hitler cannot come up with a decisive plan to break the stalemate and defeat the British in the near future, then the mistakes of 1918 may not be repeated. Recent events suggest that this kind of brewing exists within Germany.

### 100,000 Chinese Troops Cross the Yellow River; Enter the Western Shanxi Triangle Area; Chinese Troops in the Zhongtiao Mountains Attack in the Rain and Achieve Expected Results; Chinese Positions Northwest of Yuanqu and Southeast of Xiaxian Remain Firmly Unmoved

Chongqing: According to local reports, the Chinese army is dealing with the war in the Shanxi-Henan border area with a large force. 100,000 Chinese troops flew across the Yellow River at the end of last week and entered the Western Shanxi Triangle Area. They are now fighting fiercely with the Japanese army (13th-day dispatch).

Chongqing: Fierce fighting is still taking place in the foothills of the Zhongtiao Mountains in Southern Shanxi. Chinese troops are attacking in the rain and have achieved expected results. The Japanese army's attempt to clear out the Chinese troops has led them to venture deep into the mountainous area, where they have been surrounded by the Chinese army. The Chinese troops are still fighting fiercely on the mountain tops northwest of Yuanqu and southeast of Xiaxian (13th-day dispatch).

Guangzhou: The Japanese intelligence office here announced that the Japanese army began its offensive against the Chinese army in Huizhou from Boluo on May 10, and occupied the city at 4:00 pm on the 12th. Other teams fighting in the Dongjiang River occupied Huiyang, 120 kilometers east of Guangzhou. This is an important supply base for Chongqing. Another team advanced from Wanhua Gang (transliteration) to Pingshan Zui (transliteration), pursuing the retreating Chinese army. The Japanese troops who landed in Xianghai Bay are now developing an encirclement movement. Japanese planes have bombed Chinese military positions and ammunition depots in many places (14th-day Reuters dispatch).

### Johnson Leaves Chongqing for Hong Kong Yesterday; He Yaozu Represents Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to See Him Off; Wei Daoming Flies to Hong Kong on the Same Plane to Prepare for His New Post

Chongqing: US Ambassador Johnson, who has served in China for 33 and a half years, flew to Hong Kong this morning at 11:00, and will then proceed to Washington, and on to Canberra, where he will replace Gauss as the US Minister to Australia. Gauss will then come here, succeeding Johnson's position. Ambassador Johnson told a Reuters reporter, "I really feel reluctant at parting. It is rare for a person to live in a country for so long without forming inextricable ties." When talking about Sino-US relations, Johnson said, "The United States and China have gradually realized their mutual responsibilities in the Pacific. I am very pleased that this mutual understanding is even more important than the friendship that we have long enjoyed. It is like me and you, living in the same street, and each person in his own home can understand that if we keep our gardens and the open spaces in between clean and tidy, then we can not only live in peace with each other, but also improve the community in which we live. I am very pleased with this new awakening in China. The relationship between China and the United States is not only based on traditional friendship and the hope of assistance, but is based on the fact that Chinese leaders have gradually realized China's responsibility in the international community, and not just for the interests of China." Those who came to see off Ambassador Johnson included He Yaozu, representing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek; Zhang Jia'ao, Minister of Transportation; Huang Renlin, Director-General of the New Life Movement; British Ambassador Kerr; Belgian Minister De Radzitzky; Duan Maolan, Director of the American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and many other officials, as well as many leaders of cultural organizations. Before Ambassador Johnson boarded the plane, a beautiful girl presented Ambassador Johnson with a bouquet of ten flowers on behalf of the Sino-American Cultural Association. US Navy and Air Force Attaché Major McHugh will accompany Ambassador Johnson to Hong Kong. Also flying to Hong Kong on the same plane were Dr. Wei Daoming, the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to France, and Mr. Yiluote, who will be working at the Shanghai Consulate (14th-day Associated Press special correspondent Firth dispatch).

Chongqing: Wei Daoming, the newly appointed Ambassador to France, flew to Hong Kong on the China National Aviation Corporation plane at 11:00 on the 14th. Before his departure, he told a Central News Agency reporter that he was leaving the country soon and would go to Hong Kong to take care of personal matters and prepare for his new post. He would stay in Hong Kong for two weeks, and then return to Chongqing to ask Foreign Minister Guo about his departure. He would then take the route to France via Moscow. When asked about the successor to the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, he said that the position of Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan is currently being temporarily held by Director Jiang Tingfu. The new Secretary-General will be announced shortly (14th-day dispatch).

### People of Suiwest Console Soldiers Who Repair Canals

Suiwest: Since the start of the canal repair in Suiwest, excellent results have been achieved. More than 10,000 troops have participated, repairing a total of 23 large canals, with 40 million cubic meters of earthwork. The project is now mostly completed. The people have been consoling the soldiers who repaired the canals, and the provincial government has specially awarded 50,000 yuan. It will take about half a month more to fully repair all the canals, large and small, in Suiwest, and the farmers will generally benefit from the water conservancy (13th-day dispatch).

### British and American Military Supplies for the Chinese Army Arrive in Chongqing

Chongqing: According to authoritative sources here, a portion of the large amount of military supplies provided by the United Kingdom and the United States to China has now arrived in Chongqing. At the same time, many British and American technical experts are on their way to China (14th-day Reuters dispatch).

### Fuzhou Post Office Resumes Operations

Fuzhou: The situation in Fuzhou is precarious due to the freezing of public funds, with a high risk of collapse. All four government banks have withdrawn, and the Postal Savings Bank has also temporarily closed. The Post Office resumed operations yesterday morning, except for the parcel room (14th-day Reuters dispatch).

### Xu Kan to be Appointed Minister of Food

### James Roosevelt Meets King George of Greece; Personally Delivers Letter of Unity from the US President

Cairo: James Roosevelt, the eldest son of the US President, has returned here after a short trip to Crete, where he presented King George with a letter written by the President (14th-day Reuters dispatch).

### Interim Regulations on Punishing Violations of Food Management Promulgated by National Government

Chongqing: The National Government issued an order on the 12th, promulgating the Interim Regulations on Punishing Violations of Food Management during the Extraordinary Period. This order states the Interim Regulations on Punishing Violations of Food Management during the Extraordinary Period,

Article 1: Punishments for violating food management during the extraordinary period shall be carried out in accordance with these regulations. If these regulations do not provide for them, the provisions of other laws and regulations shall apply.

Article 2: The term "food" in these regulations refers to grain, rice, wheat, flour, and other coarse grains that have been announced by the government as subject to control. Article 3: Any of the following circumstances shall be deemed as hoarding for speculative purposes: (1) A person who is not engaged in business or a merchant who is not engaged in the food industry purchases and hoards food; (2) A merchant engaged in the food industry purchases and hoards food without selling it as stipulated by the food management authorities (to be continued, 14th-day dispatch)

### Rice Prices Soar in the Hefei Area

A Certain Place in Southern Anhui: According to people from north of the Yangtze River, the Japanese army is constantly collecting food in the guerrilla areas, causing rice prices in the Hefei area, which is known for its rice production, to rise to more than 100 yuan per stone. Moreover, it seems that there is no market even at that price. Many people live on vegetables and tree bark, and are extremely hungry and poor (13th-day dispatch).

### China Plans to Conclude Treaty of Friendship with Thailand

Hong Kong: Affairs between China and Thailand are extremely simple. Although there are thousands of overseas Chinese in Thailand, they have no diplomatic protection. Although there is a friendly understanding between Thailand and China, there is no diplomatic treaty, which is clear proof of this. A large number of overseas Chinese go to Thailand every year, and most of those who reside in Thailand have been there for a long time, and some were even born in Thailand. Chinese people who grow up in Thailand can be mixed with local people and are like the Thai people. In recent months, the Chongqing government has been trying to persuade the Thai authorities to sign a treaty with China so that relations between the two countries have a solid foundation. However, Bangkok has rejected the proposal, on the grounds that many years of peace and harmony do not require the mutual appointment of ambassadors. Although the number of Thai people living in China is very small, Chongqing sees the current situation of the majority of overseas Chinese in Thailand as unsatisfactory, as they are often subjected to various restrictions. For example, Chinese newspapers are inspected because they are said to hold anti-Japanese views, and many Chinese schools have had to close down due to curriculum standards. Many overseas Chinese have been forced to return to their country due to restrictions, and they have appealed to Chongqing. Thailand's refusal to sign a treaty with China is because it can do whatever it wants with overseas Chinese. Moreover, many Chinese people live in Thailand no differently from the Thai people, and it is difficult to adjust their nationality. However, the Chongqing government is still trying to conclude a treaty of friendship with Thailand so that overseas Chinese in Thailand can live and work in peace (14th-day International News Service dispatch).

### House Coinage Committee Passes Dollar Devaluation Bill

Washington. The House Coinage Committee yesterday passed, by a vote of nine to seven, a resolution to continue authorizing President Roosevelt to devalue the U.S. dollar for a period of two years. However, the bill includes an amendment stipulating that the price of foreign gold shall not exceed thirty-five U.S. dollars per ounce. Representative Andresen, a Republican from Minnesota, stated when introducing the amendment that, according to current law, the price of foreign gold could be raised to forty-one U.S. dollars per ounce. He also stated that domestic gold production is insignificant compared to world gold production. Therefore, setting the price of world gold at thirty-five U.S. dollars per ounce would ensure that any increase in domestic gold prices would not affect the value of the U.S. dollar. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

### Guardians for British Children in the U.S. and Canada

To be assigned to Halifax, etc.

London. A bill read for the first time in the House of Lords yesterday stipulated that the British Ambassador to the United States, Halifax, will be appointed as the guardian of 838 British children in the U.S., and the High Commissioner to Canada, MacDonald, will be appointed as the guardian of 1,540 British children in Canada. These British children were sent to Canada and the U.S. under the care of the Overseas Reception Committee. The appointment of guardians has already been implemented in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, because in the current emergency, British children require the permission of their parents or guardians before undergoing medical treatment.

### Hess Claims Defection Aims to Save Humanity; Remarks in Britain Expose German Weakness; Opposed German-Soviet Cooperation

London. British sources stated yesterday that the German Deputy Führer and Nazi third-in-command, Hess, defected to Britain with the illusion of "saving humanity from the tragedy of a complete German-Soviet partnership." Hess's moving ideals were revealed after the Messerschmitt aircraft he was piloting was riddled with bullets by Spitfire fighters over Scotland. Hess's first words after being identified were "I came here to save humanity." Doctors stated that Hess was completely lucid. He was not carrying any peace proposals or letters from Führer Hitler or Nazi leaders. Reliable sources stated that Hess left behind a wife and children in Germany because "the interior of Germany has become corrupt." Another near coincidence is that the owner of the property where Hess landed, the Duke of Hamilton, was once a member of the Anglo-German Fellowship. It is believed that the Duke met Hess during a flight over Mount Everest in 1933. It is rumored that the Duke is currently serving in the Royal Air Force. A responsible official here even stated that "Hess was inspired by religious fervor." (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Somewhere in Scotland. British officials have not yet announced the details of Hess's talks with British government leaders, but it is believed that Hess has spoken freely about Germany's war secrets. It is rumored that at least one member of the U.S. Cabinet has already met with Hess, and it is also rumored that Churchill will meet with him soon. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

London. British commentators stated today that Hess, the third-ranking German official who fled to Britain on Saturday night, divulged to the former First Secretary of the British Embassy in Germany, Kirkpatrick, what the Ministry of Information called the first detailed account of the Nazi Party's split since Hitler's 1934 purge of his comrades. British sources believe that at least part of this information will be included in a statement that Churchill has authorized to be released in the near future. The extent of the Nazi Party's split is not yet clear, but Dr. Murfel, who translated "Mein Kampf" and has had close ties with Nazi leaders for ten years, wrote in the "Daily Sketch" that Hess had the support of senior German commanders and was on close terms with Himmler, the head of the political police. The "Daily Telegraph" commented, "Hess's defection certainly exposes the divisions within Germany. The unity of totalitarian states is fracturing from the top down." The "Daily News" political correspondent, Webb, declared, "Hess's defection to Britain can be said to prove the violent conflict among German leaders over war policy." Meanwhile, "The Times" commented that it would be a misunderstanding to believe that Hess's defection would hasten the destruction of the unity of Germany's war machine, and that Germany's military effectiveness would not necessarily decline. In the future, when the history of this war is written, this incident will be recognized as a harbinger of the breakdown of unity and the erosion of confidence. The reasons for Hess's break with other Nazi leaders have also given rise to much speculation. Many commentators believe that Hess was displeased with the intrigues and shamelessness of Hitler's entourage, and was horrified by the massacres he had witnessed, and therefore broke decisively due to the possibility of renewed relations with the Soviet Union. Hess's decision to flee to Britain was because he believed he could accomplish some purpose. What that purpose is is unknown, whether it is to serve as a warning, to mediate peace, or to believe that only the defeat of Germany can enable humanity to progress, and that he can make Germany fail. Priestley, who previously had close ties with senior German officials, wrote in the "Daily Mail" that Hess's flight to Britain was driven by religious fervor. He wrote, "Perhaps Hess's religious faith gradually became apparent, and he discovered the fundamental evil of Nazi ambitions. Such rapid transformations are not uncommon in history." (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Hess Moved to Secret Location

London. Today's newspapers all reported that Hess has now been transferred from Glasgow to a hospital in a secret location. The only other explanation is that it is close to London. However, it is not yet known whether Hess is prepared to narrate his departure from the Nazi Party. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

London. Hess woke up in the hospital this morning in improved condition. His injured ankle is gradually healing, and the minor wound to his arm sustained when he jumped with a parachute is also healing rapidly. It is reported that he is in good spirits. Hess is wearing army pajamas and is supplied with military equipment such as a toothbrush and other items. A British army officer is guarding him while he takes his medicine. Hess spends most of his time resting and reading. The British have provided him with fiction and writing materials. Hess is writing a lot. He is eating ordinary hospital food such as chicken porridge and rice.

Recounts His Daring Flight to Britain

Hess piloted a Messerschmitt 110 fighter, which he had never flown before, alone for 900 miles, arriving at night, and made the first parachute jump of his life. His fatigue is understandable. Hess was detained by two members of the British Home Guard, Peterson and Gibson, after landing on a farm in Mackinnon. Hess told them, "There are no bombs on board, so don't worry." Hess carried a map with the route from Augsburg, Germany, to Scotland marked in blue pencil. Hess claimed that he had never been to Britain before. The Home Guard members offered him cigarettes, but he replied that he did not smoke. He was surprised to see so much fresh milk and took half a glass, saying that he had felt unwell for a long time in the plane and that his ankle was very painful. Although he had a camera with him, he did not take any pictures. He was very calm when he spoke. He thanked the Home Guard members when he left the farm and gave them a teacup as a souvenir. The plane had another fuel tank to prevent it from running out of fuel mid-flight, but he threw this fuel tank into the sea near the Scottish coast. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Hess's Nanny Knows Him Well

London. Berlin now claims that Hess has reduced his responsibilities due to mental confusion and that his defection to Scotland is meaningless both internally and externally. At the same time, the Berlin Nazi Party indicated that Hess clearly harbored the illusion that he could bring about an understanding with England. Yesterday, a Reuters correspondent in Cairo interviewed Paula, Hess's former nanny. According to Paula, "I don't believe that Hess is mentally disturbed. I believe that a serious split must have occurred within the Nazi Party, or that Hess has other ambitious plans. I was Hess's nanny, so I know him well. Hess is broad-minded, morally strong, and very honest in his dealings with people. Whether at school or elsewhere, he always strived to be the best. He often discussed important political issues with his father. From a young age, he believed that Germany was invincible." (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Hess's Wife and Children Still in Germany

London. A dispatch from Rome, citing sources in Berlin, states that Hess's wife and children are still in Germany. Reports that they have gone to Turkey are inaccurate. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

United States to Listol. Hess, who flew from Germany to Scotland on Saturday, has a child who is serving in the U.S. anti-aircraft artillery in the Panama Canal Zone. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### British Prime Minister Answers Questions in the House of Commons; Hess's Flight to Britain is Truly Bizarre; More Statements to Follow Soon

London. According to sources in the Swedish capital, Berlin is now eager to know what Hess will reveal to the British authorities. Prime Minister Churchill spoke yesterday in response to a request from the House of Commons, saying that more statements will be released soon regarding the defection of the German official to Britain. Some members of parliament said that it was unwise for the government to announce Hess's location, as German aircraft might fly there to bomb him to death, endangering the residents of Glasgow. The Prime Minister replied that Hess's location is not always Glasgow. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

London. British Prime Minister Churchill declined to elaborate on Hess's flight to Britain during questioning in Parliament yesterday, saying that he had nothing more to add than the government's statement. "I remained in the Ministry of Information late last night. I believe that this incident is so bizarre that it confounds one's imagination," he said, at which point the members of parliament laughed. Regarding the bombing of the Houses of Parliament, the Prime Minister said that regardless of Germany's actions, the British Parliament would continue to work. The old House of Commons has been damaged to such an extent that it cannot be repaired in the long term, but we are actively building the third House of Parliament. Even if these buildings are destroyed, our parliamentary system will not be interrupted. (Editor's note: The dispatch did not state where yesterday's meeting was held). (United Press dispatch, 14th)

### Hitler Convenes Nazi Leaders' Meeting; Expresses Determination to Win the War; Declares He Does Not Acknowledge Hess's Statements in Britain

Berlin. According to an official announcement by the Nazi Party last night, a meeting of key Nazi military leaders was held at Hitler's office yesterday, at which Hitler delivered a speech and was greeted with enthusiastic cheers by the attendees. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

Berlin. Official announcements stated that Hitler convened a meeting yesterday of key Nazi Party leaders and district leaders. After Hitler's address, the vast majority of attendees expressed their determination and willingness to fight to win the war. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Berlin. German officials foreshadowed yesterday that the German Deputy Führer Hess, who fled to Britain, may issue a declaration, so they stated, "We will never acknowledge any statements made by Hess in Britain. We know very well that the British authorities will abuse all kinds of brutal methods to distort his words or even fabricate them." When asked whether Hess would be expelled from the party, the reply was that there were no formal steps yet, but of course such a person would no longer be fit to be a member of the party. The German people first heard the news of Hess's arrival in Britain during the daily news broadcast at 2 p.m., which read out the party's official announcement, which stated, "No one knows Führer Hitler's innermost peace proposals as well as Hess. Hess has clearly been misled by illusions, thinking that sacrificing himself might salvage the situation, because he believes that the outcome of the situation will not stop until Britain is completely destroyed."

### German Coup About to Happen; Leader of the Black Front Speaks in the U.S.

New York. Otto Strasser, the leader of the anti-Nazi Black Front, who is currently in exile, has subordinates who are still active in secret in Germany. Strasser has received secret reports that a coup to overthrow Hitler is about to take place. Strasser believes that Hess's departure is related to this matter. The International News Service Montreal correspondent asked Strasser by telephone yesterday, and he replied that he had received "accurate information" from Germany several weeks ago stating that "the senior command of the army is at odds with the Führer and has scheduled the appointment of a famous German general as the next military dictator." Strasser was one of the founders of the Nazi Party. His brother, Gregor Strasser, was killed during the 1934 purge, and Strasser fled into exile that year. Strasser said at the end, "Hess knows that the army leaders hate him just as they hate the Führer, Himmler, and other Nazi leaders, with the exception of General Göring."

### Darlan Returns to Vichy; French Cabinet Met Yesterday Morning; Listened to Detailed Report on Negotiations; No Agreement Reached Between France and Germany

Pétain Also Held Lengthy Talks with the U.S. Ambassador

Vichy. An official communiqué stated that the Cabinet met this morning, chaired by Marshal Pétain himself, to hear Darlan's detailed report on the recent French-German negotiations. The Cabinet immediately expressed unanimous approval. The consequences of these negotiations will soon become clear. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Vichy. Cabinet Secretary Darlan returned here from Paris at 6 p.m. last night and immediately met with Marshal Pétain to report. The French official news agency was authorized yesterday afternoon to issue a report on the Darlan-Hitler-Ribbentrop meeting. This is the first time the French public has learned that these important negotiations are underway. Liu Wei said that the purpose and outcome of this meeting, as well as the price that France should pay in the provisional agreement to replace the armistice treaty, will not be announced in the near future. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Vichy. The French government issued an official gazette last night stating that the agreement signed by Germany and France in Paris on May 7 will take effect at the end of this month. The agreement stipulates the opening of traffic and remittances between the occupied and unoccupied zones, but foreign exchange is still prohibited. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

Vichy. Well-informed sources stated that the Cabinet meeting this morning discussed what decision should be made regarding the recent French-German talks. The nature of the meeting was unusually important. Darlan's negotiations with the German side were entirely in accordance with the instructions given by Marshal Pétain. Although the initial exchange of views has ended, no agreement has been reached. According to various sources, the content of Darlan's talks with the German side was very extensive. It is not easy to say exactly what the outcome will be. What is known is that these talks are a continuation of the Montoire meeting on November 24 last year (i.e., the meeting between Pétain and Hitler). With the Balkan war now over, and with the exception of Gibraltar, there are no longer any traces of British troops on the European continent. Germany is clearly thinking about the problem of European organization, and the question of what position France should occupy in the future organization is one of the current problems. The underlying purpose of Darlan's meeting with Hitler lies here, and the focus of discussion at the Cabinet meeting this morning also lies here. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Vichy. After a lengthy conversation with U.S. Ambassador to France Leahy yesterday, Marshal Pétain held secret talks with Darlan. It is believed that Pétain and Leahy discussed the situation of French-German relations, as well as the current situation of the French colonies and the Syrian mandate.

### Great Strength of British Navy Still Controls the Mediterranean; Record of Last Week's Naval and Air Battles

London. A Reuters correspondent cabled from the British warship "Barham" of the Mediterranean Fleet that enemy aircraft attempted to imitate the British naval air force's tactic of destroying the Italian fleet at Taranto in an attack on a British battle fleet sailing in the central Mediterranean. However, they were repelled by more than 30 British warships firing their guns. The British warships suffered no damage. A brief report on this battle was published by the Admiralty on Saturday and Sunday. The details are as follows. When the encounter occurred, British warships fired on enemy torpedo planes for 40 minutes. The reporter had never seen such intense gunfire at night. The moon was bright, and the escorting British cruisers opened fire several miles away. The large guns of the British battleships, up to six inches, roared immediately, while a large squadron of destroyers fired a cone-shaped barrage of fire into the sky to protect the battle fleet, in case of possible high-altitude bombing. When the battle fleet opened fire, the enemy aircraft apparently abandoned the escort and split into several squadrons, attacking the battle fleet from all sides. The reporter, looking from the "Barham," saw the fleet lined up in a long row, breaking the waves, with gunfire erupting from all sides, a truly spectacular sight. All the six-inch and eight-inch guns and rapid-fire guns, as well as machine guns, were firing, down to the sea surface and up to the sky, creating a dense web of fire. Each warship was flashing with fire from bow to stern, the sound of gunfire was deafening, and the hull was shaking. The voices of the officers issuing orders were drowned out by the gunfire. The protective barrage of fire fired by the destroyers densely surrounded the battleships, with fragments hitting the sea and water splashing. Occasionally, the gunfire would subside slightly, and the sound of clearing the shell casings would follow, preparing for continued bombardment. The last British warship initially seemed to be evading the attack, but there were no torpedo explosions near the British warships. It was night, so it was impossible to know the results of the bombardment with certainty. When the gunfire stopped, a dense fog suddenly descended. The British fleet suffered no damage. When this fierce battle occurred, the British fleet was routinely deployed to escort British ships to and from the central Mediterranean and bombard the port of Benghazi. During the seven-day period, small squadrons of Axis aircraft repeatedly attacked the British fleet, but were intercepted and scattered by the British naval air force several miles from the fleet. Seven enemy aircraft were shot down. (Reuters, 14th)

### Tojo Issues Warning: Japan Will Be Drawn Into War; Tokyo Holds Chiefs of Staff Conference; Taiwan Will Become Heart of Japan's Southern Advance

Tokyo. Japanese Army Minister Tojo warned today that the war has spread globally and Japan will be involved. He also boasted that the strength of the Japanese army is unparalleled.

### Informal Talks on the European War (55): The Decline of Mussolini

With the Italian army defeated in Africa, the domestic situation in Italy deteriorates daily. Mussolini, once a hero, has become an appendage of Hitler. The Christian Science Monitor's correspondent in Rome, Mr. [Name], recently returned and has written several articles for the newspaper, discussing the inside story of Italy, with much valuable material. The following is one of those articles.

A well-respected neutral observer in Rome said in early February this year, "This year, Italy has no responsible government. Anything can happen."

This statement reveals the current weakness of the Mussolini government. The people of Rome know of the collapse of the African Empire, and Mussolini, who was awarded the title of "Creator of the Empire," is now publicly called "Destroyer of the Empire."

Most of the key government officials have departed for the front lines. The secondary officials remaining in Rome are eager to contact Mussolini to request instructions, but they have been turned away. Revolutionary plots are about to erupt.

"Where has Mussolini gone?" As the political situation becomes increasingly chaotic, everyone is pursuing this question.

It turns out that Mussolini is going through an unprecedented crisis. People close to him say that the Prime Minister's spirit has suffered a major blow, making it difficult for him to recover. The blow, of course, refers to the series of defeats suffered by Italy in Africa. Another person who knows him well says that he has lost his normal state in both public and private matters.

According to a few people who have met with Mussolini, the Prime Minister has had disagreements with at least some of his most trusted advisors. He blames the Italian setbacks on individuals. Not only that, but he is simply at a loss on how to deal with the current crisis. His only path is to follow Germany and take a desperate gamble, hoping to share in the spoils of victory in the European situation. But this method is obviously a bad move, merely turning Italy into a German dependency, following Berlin's orders.

Two weeks before I left Rome, I heard that Mussolini had dismissed even his most loyal old comrade, Farinacci (former Secretary-General of the Fascist Party). With key officials gone, the remaining underlings are inevitably overwhelmed, without the power to give orders. They can only rely on Mussolini alone to struggle desperately.

I am discussing Mussolini not to sensationalize, but for unavoidable reasons. First, since Italy joined the war, Mussolini has become a personal dictator, so to describe the current situation in Italy, one must focus on Mussolini. Second, due to Mussolini's personal decline, German political police and technicians have been able to control the core of Italy in the name of assistance, forcing Mussolini to follow Hitler.

That being said, Mussolini's regime is not about to end just yet. Germany is providing "sustenance" to help him consolidate his foundation. Germany acknowledges that Mussolini is the best friend of Germany in Italy. Otherwise, if someone else came to power, there would be a danger of turning to Britain.

We have every reason to believe that Hitler is prepared to honor his agreement to aid Mussolini for a considerable period in order to shore up his "older brother's" reputation. However, the pain is only known to the Fascist leaders, as one of the party's key figures said to someone with a heavy heart, "I am extremely depressed."

Mussolini's political illness may one day be cured, just like his sudden appearances and disappearances on the political stage. But in Rome today, shouting "Mussolini is finished" will certainly not help him to recover, that is certain.

Mussolini is not entirely ignorant of Hitler. When he first met Hitler, he said to his son-in-law, Foreign Minister Ciano, "I can cooperate with Hitler when necessary. But Hitler and I can never be bosom buddies."

Mussolini's view never changed. Until Italy's defeat, the Fascists still liked to act alone, which often made Berlin extremely difficult to deal with. Although the communiqués issued after each meeting between Mussolini and Hitler stated that "both sides were in complete agreement," Mussolini's attempt to exert his influence and compete with Hitler was well known.

So why is Mussolini following Hitler so closely, even at the risk of a desperate gamble? This requires recalling what Mussolini said to Ciano after he failed to prevent Hitler from annexing Austria.

"One day," he said, "Germany will be invincible in Europe. At that time, I will form an alliance with Germany."

In May 1939, the "day" Mussolini had hoped for arrived. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Hitler told him successively that Germany was confident of winning every battle. Ribbentrop even explained Germany's plan to conquer Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Britain in order.

Germany followed the plan, and it was perfectly accurate until France was defeated. Mussolini felt that he was really a good judge of people and could not help but feel proud. Before, he criticized others for "being in a dangerous situation," but now he himself was preparing to do the same.

Mussolini is a practical man. After recognizing his mistakes, he strives to make amends. On the eve of my departure from Rome, a diplomat told me, "Mussolini, regardless of everything, is increasingly pro-German, hoping to save his position."

Mussolini's most recent meeting with Hitler in Germany took place after the Italian army's disastrous defeat in Libya. Someone saw him getting on the train, full of melancholy, irritated by everyone. But when he returned, he was smiling again, as usual.

But Mussolini is different now than he was in the past.

According to rumors in Rome, someone discovered Mussolini in his office one day holding an umbrella.

"But it's not raining," a friend reminded him.

"Yes," Mussolini replied, "but it's raining in Berlin!"

### Food: Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Sale of Rice; First Batch of 50,000 Bags Arrives Complete; Foreign Rice Drops Slightly, Japonica Rice Still Rises

The Shanghai Municipal Council's purchase of Rangoon small-grain foreign rice, the first 5,000 tons, has arrived in full. The first batch of over 11,100 bags, loaded on the Taikoo Hanyang and Ewo Mingsheng ships, has been shipped from Hong Kong and arrived on Sunday (11th). Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the Taikoo Taiyuan ship also loaded 10,000 bags, and the Jiangsu ship also loaded 15,000 bags. Both ships arrived in the evening of the 12th and have now been completely unloaded. The four ships together carried over 56,100 bags, totaling over 5,000 tons. Therefore, the first purchase of foreign rice has all arrived in Shanghai. Subsequently, it can be continuously transported, and there is no worry about food supply, and the price can also be reduced. (Source)

The market for foreign rice yesterday saw a straight-line downward trend. Spot rice fell a total of about three yuan in the morning and afternoon. Futures rice fell slightly by one or two yuan in the morning and two or three yuan in the afternoon. The trend is even weaker and more listless. The rumors on the market that were favorable to the bulls have been dispelled because more than 50,000 bags of Hong Kong rice have all arrived in Shanghai and are about to be sold. In addition to the second batch of Hong Kong rice being negotiated, there is also an announcement that the first batch of Vietnamese rice sold at a flat price will arrive in Shanghai in the middle of the month. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of bags of rice in stock on the market, a large number of chips for the April and May futures rice will also arrive in Shanghai one after another. With such a large supply, sales are waiting and watching. Speculators and those who are not strong-willed are all eager to sell at a reduced price. Therefore, the rice market fell sharply after the opening. Small-grain rice opened at 117 yuan and then fell by half a yuan or one yuan to 115 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell again from 115 yuan to 113 yuan. Broken rice fell to 80 yuan. Also, Saigon fire-grain rice has not yet opened for sale in the afternoon, and the market atmosphere may fall by another one or two yuan. English Mou's is even weaker and difficult to revive. Saigon No. 1 April and May opened at 143.5 yuan in the morning and fell to 139 yuan in the afternoon. Broken rice fell to 110.05 yuan in the morning and was only bid at 10.08 yuan in the afternoon, which is four, five, or six yuan less than the previous day. The total daily transaction volume was 15,000 bags of spot rice and over 700 tons of futures.

Domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica rice, because its source has suddenly experienced a sharp drop, transporters have mostly stopped, resulting in a sparse arrival of goods. Merchants are generally unwilling to sell lightly. At the same time, local shops, etc., seeing that the market has presented a fluctuating situation, are thinking of taking this opportunity to purchase goods, so the sales market feels active. The price of both thick and thin japonica rice has risen by about two yuan. Tin japonica is quoted at 140 yuan. Kunshan white japonica rose from 138 yuan to 135 yuan. Nangang early and late rice rose from 136 yuan to 132 or 133 yuan. Original bag is 138.5 yuan or 138 yuan.

The route for glutinous rice is still not wide, only scattered demand from food vendors, etc. As a result, in the midst of the weakness of foreign rice, the situation also appears soft. Hong Kong white yuan is quoted at 117.3 yuan or 117 yuan, and Nuo Lu is 107 or 108 yuan.

The flour market is still downstream.

The current situation of the foreign flour market is still downstream. Because the price of rice continues to fall and foreign flour orders are arriving one after another, people's hearts are ultimately weak. Therefore, when the market falls slightly, buyers immediately stand by and watch. Australian flour from the Flower Bird Bell Tower brand is lacking buyers. Only the Golden Dragon brand and the Fort brand are making slight improvements. Golden Dragon flour still needs to open at 30.085 yuan, and then it will loosen to 7 jiao, 6 jiao, and 5 jiao. The Fort brand is 31 yuan to 30.095 yuan. There were five or six thousand bags of transactions. The future of the market needs to wait for the actual sales to unfold before there is hope of recovery. The factory's flat-priced flour is still 29 yuan. However, when the Japanese flour market is falling, the needs of this street are also not greedy. It is heard that the factory price will also be lowered when necessary.

Wheat trading is as stagnant as usual. Because the arrival of goods from the mainland has long been cut off, the raw materials of each flour mill are also waiting for the new wheat to be launched on the market before buying. Only the Japanese factory's front door occasionally receives goods, and the price has been reduced by one or two yuan. It is heard that the price of Gao Du wheat is 46 or 47 yuan. The market still needs to be watched cautiously.

### Government Bonds Are Rising

The situation of government bonds in the off-market yesterday, because after the intraday retracement, the brokers wanted to raise prices again, so as not to fall again. Temporarily, it actually worked. Generally, those who follow the trend filled short positions and went long. Whether the price increase has continued, let's wait and see. Yesterday morning, Xinhua, Sinfu, and Hefeng bought in, and Lianhe, Yitai, and Delong sold out. General retail investors were also very enthusiastic about buying in. The market price was low and then high, and the midday close was good for about four jiao. In the afternoon, it continued to pull up. The market price rose and fell suddenly, flickering and uncertain. Tongkang bought in, which caused Lianyi, Dingkang, and Xinhua to help raise prices, while Lianhe and Yichang came out at high prices. More than 90% of Dunyu Yitai also released. The market price fell several times, but was still raised. As a result, they all closed back well, with seven jiao to eight and a half jiao. The transaction volume was 1.4 to 1.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading, 50 shares of Shanghai Stock Exchange shares were traded at a price of 50 yuan.

The public stock market is more optimistic, and the trading is quite active. Soon, rumors suddenly arose, causing the market to soften immediately. The closing price returned up again, and the potential is still good.

London, 13th (Wednesday) telegram. Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and British companies in the Far East remain flat. Only the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's British-registered shares rose by half a pound, priced at 72 pounds. There were no other changes.

### Shanghai Enterprise Company Has Been Liquidated and Dissolved

In the past year, there have been no less than six or seven new foreign stocks publicly raised by Jewish people in Shanghai. The Shanghai Enterprise Company, which was the first to be recruited and established, was resolved by the board of directors last Saturday to be automatically liquidated. This is also a small vicissitude in the Shanghai foreign stock market.

The Shanghai Enterprise Company was originally a private company, and its shares were held equally by International Trust and Yangzi Bank. They were the ones who allocated some real estate held by the two companies to supplement capital. A year ago, through the hands of Luan & Co., 180,000 shares were sold to the outside world at a price of 5.5 yuan per share (par value 5 yuan), and the remaining 140,000 shares were still in the hands of the two companies. Later, in order to expand business, 600,500 new shares were re-raised, and management rights were transferred from accountant Tan Shipang to Wheelock & Co. In the second half of last year, the stock price often called for around 5 yuan. This spring, a dividend of one cent was issued for the previous year, and the market price rose slightly.

Recently, the company sent a circular to its shareholders stating that all real estate has been sold one after another. Originally, the company's main business was the sale and purchase of real estate. Now, in view of the fact that most of the people who purchase real estate in Shanghai are people who live outside of Shanghai, and they have other purposes, and the income is not their question, so the price is getting higher and higher, and the operators have no interest to plan. Therefore, it is planned to abandon this business and specialize in investing and buying and selling stocks in this city, or immediately engage in liquidation. These two matters seek shareholders' opinions to decide the future actions.

According to the company's circular this time, it is known that the company currently has 2.65 million yuan in cash, and various active assets, including shareholders in this city, are worth approximately 4,016,820 yuan according to the closing price on April 25. If it is decided to continue business, it is planned to issue an interim dividend of 1 yuan. If it is decided to dissolve the liquidation, it is planned to distribute cash and most of the International Trust shares held back to the shareholders.

Now the company has decided to liquidate and dissolve. According to the company's shares, there are a total of 925,000 shares. It is now decided to issue 1.25 yuan per share for this year's profit in late May, and the rest will be liquidated after a special meeting of shareholders is convened. Although the foreign stock price is much lower than the closing price on April 25, such as the International Trust's weekly statistics price this week, it is only about 27 yuan, which is more than 2 yuan less. The company's assets have of course fallen along with it. But in general, in addition to profits, it seems that the original capital can be recovered. (According to the market price estimated on April 25, if it is dissolved, the property of each share is worth about 7 yuan.) (Xuan Wen)

### Finance: Rumors of US Dollar Devaluation Again; US Exchange Rate Tightens First and Then Returns

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, HSBC's listed prices, all exchanges did not change. The pound-dollar off-market pound-gold remained stable, and the dollar tightened first and then returned to flat. It was rumored that the US House of Representatives passed the battleship escort bill, and it was also heard that the US President has the power to reduce the fineness of the dollar. The price of gold also changed from rising to falling. Therefore, in the selling wind of banks and speculators in China, the US dollar recovered from 5.3125 yuan to 5.40625 yuan. Finally, because British and American commercial banks had to settle, it returned to 5.34375 yuan. The pound-gold 3 pence and 28125 yuan were all in line with the previous day's closing price. The transaction was normal. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Speculation Blocks Out Bank Receipts

Since the morning, foreign telegraphic transfer gold prices were consistent and not changed. Each country's exchange rate, the US to Shanghai, suddenly returned small eight cents, the rest were not changed. The opening buying prices of banks in the morning, spot pound exchange rate was 3 pence and 28125 yuan, the US dollar was 5.34375 yuan. Hua merchants first came to block out next month's US dollar at 5.375 yuan, and it was hard to sell. The HSBC price was flat. The silver balance tax is still levied at 24.50%. Foreign British and American banks had a good intake. It was also heard that import foreign firms continued to settle rice payments. The price of gold also stepped up to more than 6,500 yuan, so it was soft. The settlement was only 5.3125 yuan. Around 11 o'clock, speculators came out of Zhejiang and blocked out June at 5.375 yuan.

### After the Swap, the Gold Market Seems

The seller posted out to the buyer, initially calling for 40 yuan. Later, it was heard that Juduo, Xinfengyong, Dafeng, Xinyuan, and Chengji were all watching and not advancing.

At 10:45, the foreign exchange reported tight, and it was difficult to settle June US dollars at 5.34375 yuan, so people's hearts were even firmer. Xinyuan, Dafeng, and Defu advanced sharply, floating short positions and cutting them off, and sellers were at a loss. The price then flew out of 6,500 yuan and reached 6,518 yuan. After 11:10, Gonghe and Deda came out sharply, and there were negative rumors, and the foreign exchange reported hard. Dafeng, Yida, and Xinfengyong also came to sell sharply, and many retail investors rose up to sell, and for a time buyers disappeared.

### Cotton Yarn: Speculative Minds Uneasy, Yarn Market Fluctuates

The yarn market is once again in a state of flux, with rumors abounding, causing anxieties to swirl like hemp. This is due to the unsettled minds of speculators, leading to sudden rises and falls in the market. However, actual transactions remain as dull as ever. Except for some demand for coarse yarn from Hong Kong merchants, there is no appetite for anything else. Some say that 20-count yarn from other ports is cheap, making it unprofitable for traders. However, large players who have purchased remain unmoved, reportedly because raw materials are not loosening, and they have no intention of selling. It is said that the factories are keeping their Shuang Ma yarn orders closed, and the supply of warehouse receipts is unusually tight. Therefore, those betting on price increases are once again actively buying. 20-count Single Horse yarn reached a high of $1486 and a low of $1448. In the early afternoon, it traded at $1470, rising to $1476 before falling back to $1472, with the final price at $1476.

The Shuang Ma market opened well in the morning, with some inclination to buy due to rising American cotton. The opening price was $1455, falling slightly to $1450. Then, news came that short positions on margin calls were being posted, and those betting on higher prices mostly bought more, causing the market to gradually rise to $1476. Some profits were taken along the way, but the consensus in the market was bullish, even though actual demand was minimal. It rose all the way to $1486. Unexpectedly, as the price rose, a sudden reversal occurred, and with the return of rumors, margin calls fell by $100 in an instant. Sellers suddenly became active, and securities firms collectively sold off, causing the price to plummet to $1448. However, after 12 o'clock, it was said that the various rumors were inaccurate, and buyers became active again, causing the market to rise and close at $1469. The total trading volume for the day was 15,780 bales. The amounts purchased by various groups are listed below:

Fellow traders: 15,000; Hong Kong merchants: 780

Total: 15,780

### Cotton Market on Solid Footing

The current cotton situation is slightly better. Due to the sharp rise in American cotton, a slight contraction in foreign exchange rates, and good yarn prices, sentiment is firm, and holders are generally unwilling to sell. Fine cotton raw materials remain very strong, but factory demand is not yet very strong. Yesterday, a total of 460 bales were traded, with prices rising by $5-6.

Brazilian cotton: 409 bales, traded by Qingsheng, 235 bales

Middling cotton: 417 bales, traded by Jiufeng, 100 bales

Also: 421 bales, traded by Jifeng, 125 bales

Another report from Shanghai says that foreign cotton transactions by foreign firms remain stagnant due to weak factory demand. However, due to the frequent increases in overseas freight rates and the repeated price increases in American and Indian cotton, the cotton market is on a relatively solid footing.

The New York cotton market saw enthusiastic buying due to Washington political news, smooth progress of the National Government, the impact of the 85% cotton and wheat loan, and good cotton cloth trading conditions. Market sentiment was upbeat, and the market became more active and bullish. Yesterday's closing prices were $0.50 to $0.70 higher per pound than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to factory purchases, followed by profit-taking, and finally rose again due to speculative buying and strong overseas markets. As a result, closing prices, except for White Broach for April and May, which rose by 10 rupees, rose by 1 to 4 rupees.

It is predicted that the market will open higher by 5.75 rupees today.

### Piece Goods: Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang Have the Highest Cloth Sales

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market fluctuated, and sentiment was erratic. Prices rose steadily in the morning, but there was a brief reversal near noon, followed by another rise in the afternoon. As a result, white cloth, fine cloth, and twill cloth each rose by $0.50 to $1, while coarse cloth rose by $0.25 to $0.50. Bleached and dyed cloth also saw increased demand. Sales to Guangdong, Hong Kong, and foreign merchants were the strongest, while demand from other routes was mediocre, due to the continued control of transportation routes. About 500 pieces of various cloths were traded in this street, with Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants buying over 400 pieces of twill and colored cloth, and foreign merchants from Siam and other places buying over 5,000 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, and colored cloth.

Eastern Cloth: Prices rose and then fell, before rising again. As a result, fine cloth rose by $0.50, and fine twill rose by about $1. Longtou fine cloth closed at $49 after the current warehouse receipts were traded. Sijunzi serge was at $1.52. The market was particularly active, but most of the transactions were speculative, and actual sales to customers remained sluggish.

### Woolens: Firm and Weak Conditions Vary

Yesterday's woolen market saw limited trading with foreign merchants, but very active trading within this street. Looking at the sales prices of various goods, conditions varied between firm and weak. Items such as autumn-selling medium-thick dark-colored flannels, serge, heavy-weight woolen fabric, official Western suit woolens, fireproof Four-Brand Harris tweed, winter-selling Malle and other flat thick woolens, men's and women's colored overcoat woolens, long-haired velvet, mohair velvet, straight tribute shoe felt, etc., were mostly firm and expensive. Items such as 巴勒呢 (Bale tweed), 胖別取 (Pangbiequ), feather yarn woolens, white serge, white tribute, linen rubber cloth, etc., were mostly flat and weak. Palissy was in continued decline. The Yihua Palissy, which sold for $22 per yard last month, sold for $18.75 yesterday.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Sees Some Transactions

Yesterday, the overseas silk market saw no movement in New York. The opening price of raw silk in Yokohama was ¥10 higher than the previous day, with the near-term July contract at ¥1535 and the forward contract slightly higher by ¥6 than the previous day. Local foreign silk firms continued to make transactions. 特上 Tussah silk sold for $4975, first-grade for $4675, and second-grade for $4625. Yihua and Dachang, etc., bought about 30-odd bales. White filature silk 20/22, with evenness of 7/8, also saw some sales at $6200. However, due to the scarcity of controlled goods, transactions were limited.

### Sugar Market: Coarse Sugar Continues to Fall

Yesterday, the sugar market trended downwards, leading to a continued sharp drop. The Association's futures market for coarse white sugar, with delivery on the 20th of this month, opened at $111.20, falling to $111.10, $110.05, $110.30, $110.40, $110.10, and $109.70, closing at $110.04, a drop of $2.30. Those with delivery at the end of the month initially traded at $113, falling to $112.60, $112.10, $112.20, $112, $111.90, $111.60, $111.40, $111, and $110.75, a small drop of $3.30. Taikoo granulated sugar also fell along with coarse sugar, with B mark at $112, a small drop of $2, and HX mark at $98.50.

### North-South Goods: Bamboo Shoots Offer Freshness

The first batch of fresh bamboo shoots arrived yesterday, totaling 60 pieces, and were immediately offered for sale at a price of $370, which is quite high. The market is very brisk.

### Coal: New Shipment of White Coal Arriving Soon

—Price Increased by Another $30—

It has been widely rumored in the market that a large shipment of new Hongji white coal is about to arrive in port. However, traders in the same industry increased the price by another $30 yesterday, raising it from $400 to $430 per ton by truckload, similar to the black market price. At this time of slow sales, the price is being raised again and again, which is puzzling. Therefore, stores in this street have also raised their prices, with lump coal selling for $460 per ton, and screened coal for $476, delivered to customers, including transportation costs.

### Sundries: Matches, Candles, Soap—Prices All Dropped Slightly

The prices of daily necessities have been falling for several days, and hoarders both inside and outside the industry are eager to sell, with few new hoarders. Prices are generally flat and weak. Yesterday, the market saw Meili brand matches selling for $700 per case, and Fenghuang brand for $691 per case, both down by more than $20. Guben soap sold for $56.50 per case, Baixiangmao soap for $47 per case, and Huangxiangmao soap for $44 per case, all down by $2-3. Ship brand candles sold for $27 per case. The market atmosphere is unlikely to improve.

### New US Ambassador to China Arrives in Shanghai, Leaves for Provisional Capital This Morning to Assume Office. American Community Held Welcome Banquet Last Night. Ambassador Denies Statements Attributed to Him by Japanese Sources. New Commander of US Fourth Marine Regiment, Howard, Arrives on Same Ship.

The newly appointed US Ambassador to China, Gauss, and the new Commander of the US Fourth Marine Regiment in Shanghai, Colonel Howard, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM on the US Mail Steamship Company's latest ship, the President Garfield, from the United States. The ship docked at buoys 12 and 13 in the Huangpu River. US Consul General Lockwood, Commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet Rear Admiral Glassford, the current Commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment Colonel Baker, and the President of the American Community Association, Dr. Hinsdale, all boarded the ship to welcome them. They accompanied the two gentlemen, dividing into two US Navy special motorboats, and landed at the Customs Wharf at around 9:00 AM. Ambassador Gauss will stay here overnight and is scheduled to depart on the same ship for Hong Kong at 11:30 AM today to fly to Chongqing to assume his new post. Commander Howard is scheduled to be officially sworn in within a few days. Details are recorded below.

Transit Through Japan

The newly appointed US Ambassador to China, Gauss, traveled to Chongqing to assume his new post on the US President Line's newest giant ship, the President Garfield, and passed through Shanghai yesterday morning (the 14th), making a brief stop. Reporters boarded the ship to interview him. Gauss completely denied the Japanese news agency's report that he had said a military conference would soon be held in Singapore. He stated that he did not make any statements to the Japanese press while passing through Japan, so the news reported by the Japanese news agency has no basis. He knows nothing about military affairs, and this trip is only to go to Chongqing to take up his new post.

Enjoyable Time in Australia

When asked about US aid to China, Gauss said that he had only just arrived in Shanghai and could not comment. He added that he had a very enjoyable time as the first US Minister to Australia and that Australia itself is a very interesting country. Gauss refused to make any further comments, saying that he could not discuss any issues while en route to Chongqing to take up his new post.

US Officials Meet and Greet with Pleasure

After the President Garfield arrived in port yesterday morning, Commander of the US Navy Yangtze Patrol Force Rear Admiral Glassford, US Consul General in Shanghai Lockwood, US Judge Advocate General Helmholtz, and Commander of the US Fourth Marine Regiment Colonel Baker all boarded the ship to welcome him. Gauss met with them and was overjoyed. He then chatted happily with several journalists for a moment before leaving the ship and transferring to a US Navy supply motorboat to disembark at the Bund.

Porter Likely Accompanying to Chongqing

When Gauss was the US Consul General in Shanghai last year, he was appointed as the first US Minister to Australia. Recently, he was promoted to US Ambassador to China to succeed Johnson. Former Acting US Consul General in Shanghai Porter likely also boarded the President Garfield to accompany Gauss to Chongqing. It is said that Mr. Porter will stay in Chongqing for a short time before returning to Beijing to take up his post as Counselor at the US Embassy.

Grand Banquet by American Community Organizations

Yesterday afternoon from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM, the American Community Association and the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai held a banquet at the Columbia Country Club to welcome Ambassador Gauss. Public and private organizations attending included the US Consulate, the American Community Association, the American Chamber of Commerce, the American General Association, the US Yangtze River Fleet, the US Fourth Marine Regiment, the American Women's General Federation, the American Association of University Women, the American United Church, and other business organizations. Lockwood, Baker, Glassford, and Hinsdale all gave welcome speeches. This welcome event was the broadest gathering of the American community in Shanghai, and the number of participants was unprecedented. However, because the event was of significant importance, it was not open to non-American guests. As Mr. Gauss had extensive contacts during his previous tenure as US Consul General in Shanghai, yesterday's welcome meeting must have been attended by many dignitaries, making it a grand occasion.

Mr. Howard Inspects Troops

The newly appointed Commander of the US Marine Corps Fourth Marine Regiment in Shanghai, Colonel Howard, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning (the 14th) on the President Garfield. The current Commander of the Regiment, Colonel Baker, boarded the ship to welcome him. Mr. Howard also met with other US officials yesterday morning, such as Commander of the US Navy Yangtze Patrol Force Rear Admiral Glassford, US Consul General in Shanghai Lockwood, and President of the American Community Association Dr. Hinsdale. It is reported that the US military will conduct maneuvers at the Racecourse on Saturday morning, to be inspected by Mr. Howard and Mr. Baker. Mr. Howard joined the Marine Corps in 1914 and served in Haiti the following year. After the United States entered the war, he served in the Atlantic on the US ships Wheeling, Georgia, and New Mexico. In 1921, he was stationed in Washington. The following year, he was transferred to Santo Domingo. In 1924, when the US Marine Corps Fourth Marine Regiment was stationed in Santo Domingo, Mr. Howard once served in the Regiment.

Famous Figures Arrive on the Same Ship

The newly appointed Spanish Consul General to Manila, Carduna, also passed through Shanghai on the President Garfield, but declined to discuss the European situation or the possibility of Spain's participation in the war. Other passengers on the ship included the Bolivian Consul General to Singapore, Monteneegro, a reporter from the Combined Press, Ms. Du, and the General Manager of Standard Oil Company of New York in Shanghai, Mr. Tugot, who was returning to Shanghai after taking a vacation in the United States. Ms. Du of the Combined Press was previously a feature writer for the US Tribune. This trip is to Chongqing, where she plans to engage in Red Cross work and film activities during her work.

### Rumor That Several American Nationals Are Secretly Returning to Shanghai

The Continental Daily News reports that several American men and women have recently returned to Shanghai secretly. Their method is to purchase tickets from Manila to Honolulu and disembark in Shanghai en route. Regarding this matter, it is said that all American passports are printed with the law that anyone who violates these legal restrictions and returns to Shanghai will be fined US$2,000, or imprisoned for up to five years, or both fined and imprisoned. This law applies to American nationals who return to Shanghai without official permission, but those whose passports are still valid in China are not affected.

### Yu Qiaqing Has No Intention of Returning to Shanghai for the Time Being

After Yu Qiaqing went to Hong Kong and then to Chongqing, he has been busy inspecting industries in various places. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired with associates of Mr. Yu yesterday morning, Mr. Yu will be stationed in Chongqing for a long time because the Sanbei Company in Chongqing is his business. He has no intention of returning to Shanghai for the time being.

New US Ambassador to China, Gauss, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning

### British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Issues Open Letter to British Nationals Urging Eligible British Nationals to Consider Enlistment

A reporter from Pingming News Agency recently learned from the information office of the British Embassy in Shanghai that the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, will today issue an open letter to all British nationals in China, stating: "Every British national has a duty to serve in the military. In the past, I have indicated to you that fulfilling your duties in your current positions is also a way to contribute to the war effort. However, the situation has changed somewhat today. The country needs more men. All eligible British nationals in China should consider whether their current positions are more important than participating in the war. This applies particularly to young men between the ages of twenty and thirty (including those who are married or unmarried). Businesses should also consider that if young men enlist, we will not be able to take special measures if their ability to work far exceeds those who remain in their positions. While it is important for British commerce to maintain continued efficiency in China, it is more important to increase the number of enlisted personnel. I am confident that businesses will do their best to find ways to maintain efficiency and will not prevent young men in combat positions from leaving their jobs."

### Airplane Passengers to Hong Kong Must Be Vaccinated and Have Certificates of Immunization

Traffic between Hong Kong and the mainland relies solely on air routes. The Hong Kong government recently announced that passengers flying from Hong Kong to Nanxiong, Guilin, Chongqing, Kunming, and to Lashio and Rangoon must complete vaccination procedures and obtain certificates of immunization before departure. The immunization procedures must be completed no more than three months and no less than five days before departure by receiving smallpox vaccination and cholera inoculation from a Hong Kong port doctor and purchasing a certificate of immunization, or a certificate issued by a doctor recognized by the Hong Kong government, endorsed by the port doctor, is also valid.

Same Procedure for Going to Rangoon

Also, passengers traveling from Hong Kong to Guangzhou Bay and Rangoon must be inoculated and vaccinated by a doctor recognized by the Hong Kong government before boarding the ship, and the validity period is six months. Certificates issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department are also recognized by the Hong Kong government. Therefore, those traveling from Shanghai to the mainland via Hong Kong only need to complete the above procedures in Shanghai to pass without hindrance.

Name of Certificate-Issuing Agency Changed

To cope with the current situation, the Hong Kong authorities announced the Immigration Ordinance on November 22 of last year to prevent undesirable elements from entering, requiring law-abiding residents entering Hong Kong to obtain an entry permit. According to news from the aviation industry, the Hong Kong authorities feared that the name "Immigration Bureau" might cause misunderstanding and announced a name change on the 28th of last month to "Immigration Affairs Bureau," while the English name remains the same. However, those who actually reside in Hong Kong do not need to obtain a permit.

### Business Labor Dispute to Be Resolved This Week

The labor dispute at the Commercial Press has lasted for more than three weeks. Although Ms. Xing De and Mr. Lu Gaoyi came forward to mediate fairly, they were unable to resolve it as scheduled due to differences of opinion between labor and management. After Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the Hong Kong branch, appointed Mr. Li Bojia to handle the matter in Shanghai, it still remained unresolved for a long time. It is now known that Mr. Li has reported in detail to the Hong Kong head office the various suggestions put forward by the employee association and the course of repeated meetings. On the 13th of this month, the employee association sent representatives to Mr. Li to discuss the resolution and strongly requested that the management withdraw the order to dismiss and transfer personnel. Mr. Li promised to make a final decision after receiving a reply from Hong Kong. It is said that the reply is expected to arrive within a week.

Tea Industry Treatment Resolved

It is now learned that the labor dispute in the tea manufacturing industry has been resolved through mediation by the Political Department of the Public Concession. The improved treatment conditions agreed upon by labor and management are recorded below: (1) A general cost-of-living subsidy of CN$1.25 will be added to each worker, bringing the total wage to CN$2.50. (2) An additional CN$0.20 will be provided for meals each day, and an additional CN$0.20 for snacks each night for night workers, bringing the total to CN$0.50. (3) Start-up fees and completion liquor, coveralls, etc., will be increased by CN$2, bringing the total to CN$4.

Color Printing Labor Relations Close

Due to the continued rise in the cost of living, the wages earned by workers in the color printing industry are insufficient to support their families. They have requested that management improve treatment and increase wages. The conditions they have put forward are: 5 dou of Saigon rice per person per month, wages below CN$30 to be increased by 120%, those from CN$41 to CN$80 to be increased by 100%, weekly rest, night work to be six hours per shift, and nine hours per day to be the standard, as well as holiday pay and severance pay, etc. However, management has not made any indication. The workers then started a slowdown yesterday. It is now reported that more than a dozen printing factories, such as Xiehe, Zhonghua, Sida, and Dahua, have requested Zhuang Ping to act as mediator. After Mr. Zhuang explained openly and fairly, both sides have gradually moved closer to agreement. Once the workers put forward representatives to negotiate, the slowdown can be resolved satisfactorily.

Small Newspaper Printing Workers Lose Jobs

The Newspaper Friends Mutual Aid Association, composed of workers in the printing of small newspapers, has decided that (1) to prevent increased unemployment, limit the indiscriminate admission of apprentices; (2) register unemployed members to find ways to introduce them to jobs; (3) draft a work outline; (4) solicit owners of printing shops as sponsors; and (5) seek the opinions of members to find ways to improve.

The injured and killed passengers were handled by the Japanese side and the local authorities.

### Treatment Experience of Those Who Quit Opium Addiction

Weiguang Hospital's first free opium addiction treatment program has been quite effective. Here are letters to the newspaper from Huang Huankui, Zai Yunsheng, and Zhang Yongpei, who received treatment: "To the esteemed editors of Shen Bao, we are writing to inform you that we have been addicted to opium for seven or eight years or more, due to illness or poor circumstances, and have been sinking into the black sea day and night, unable to extricate ourselves. Moreover, due to economic difficulties, we have become increasingly mired. This time, we happened to read your newspaper and learned that Mr. Wang Fen generously donated money and that your newspaper warmly introduced the Weiguang Hospital's meticulous treatment, especially the anti-drug special medicine "Andidu Jing" invented by Dr. Li Weiguang, which was injected for four days. Sure enough, we were no longer intoxicated or in pain. The opium addiction of many years has been completely eliminated, and the bad thoughts in our minds have also been completely swept away. It really restored our freedom and brought us to the other shore. We entered the hospital on May 1 and were discharged on May 7, only a week before and after. It was really like a completely different person. After that, we were clean, light, and happier than ever. Moved by this, we are writing out the facts of our experience to report it. If it can be published in your newspaper and tell fellow sufferers in the world, then the beneficiaries will not only be us. We hereby inform you and express our gratitude. Respectfully, Huang Huankui, Wang Yunsheng, and Zhang Yongpei, May 14."

They are now well-behaved and no longer in their former vagrant state.

### Indian Shipping Leader, Van Ryckevorsel, Passes Through Shanghai: Claims External Reports of Japan's Situation Are Accurate; No Large-Scale Rebellion in India

Van Ryckevorsel, an Indian shipping magnate, has completed his official business at the British Embassy in Tokyo and is returning to India aboard the President Garfield. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 14th). According to him, all news from within Japan is one-sided. He could not discuss the current state of Japan in detail, but he did say that most external reports about Japan are accurate. He left India more than two months ago to handle some work at the British Embassy in Tokyo, but he declined to disclose the precise nature of his trip. When asked about the situation in India, Van Ryckevorsel replied that any country that has not achieved independence feels dissatisfied, but there is absolutely no large-scale rebellion in India as rumored. These rumors are spread by some external party with the intention of sowing discord. Van Ryckevorsel also stated that he has no interest in disembarking in Shanghai because, apart from nightlife and entertainment venues, there is nothing worth seeing, so he does not want to waste his time.

### Hong Kong Rice on Sale This Weekend: Limited to Two Dou Per Person; Half a Stone Per Family Per Week; Unlimited Sales When Supply Is Sufficient; First Batch of Government Rice Arrives Tomorrow at Same Price

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that the Council has purchased 165,000 bags of rice from the Hong Kong government, of which approximately 60,000 bags have already arrived at the port and are being unloaded, with the remainder expected to arrive before the end of this month. Based on the average daily consumption of various types of rice in the International Settlement and the French Concession last year, the rice purchased by the Council is clearly sufficient to meet the needs of society once properly distributed.

Quantity of Sales Temporarily Restricted

The Council has now decided that until the supply of rice is sufficient to warrant unrestricted sales, the amount of rice sold by any store to each household, family, or group shall not exceed half a stone per week. Purchases are limited to those for personal consumption, until further notice. To implement the above decision, the quantity sold by stores to each individual at each transaction shall be limited to two dou (16 kilograms). The Council has already notified retail stores of the regulations and will task the police with close inspection to ensure strict compliance. The rice transported by the Council will be available for sale at retail rice shops in the International Settlement and the French Concession this weekend. The selling price is currently set at 110 yuan in national currency per full stone (80 kilograms). These stores must sell their original rice stock first; mixing with other grains is strictly prohibited. Anyone who discovers any violations of the above regulations regarding distribution, price, or quality of rice is urged to report it to the nearest police station.

Rice Already on the Wharf

Six thousand bags of Hong Kong rice transported to Shanghai by the Hanyang, Minsheng, Taiyuan, and Jiangsu vessels were unloaded overnight by laborers hired by Lap Kee & Co. to expedite distribution to rice merchants. The unloading was completed by 5:00 PM yesterday. It is reported that some firms that ordered this Hong Kong rice went to pick up their goods yesterday. Lap Kee & Co. has also delivered hundreds of small bags of rice samples to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Rice Merchants Association. It is claimed that the quality is excellent.

Pick-Up Today

According to Lap Kee & Co. staff, rice firms and merchants will begin picking up their goods starting today in preparation for sale. According to staff at Cheung Mow & Co., which handles Hong Kong rice collections, some rice merchants have not yet fully paid for their orders. Therefore, it is hoped that rice firms and merchants will pay early to pick up their rice as soon as possible. According to inquiries made by reporters at the rice market, Hong Kong rice is also already being sold in the market, mostly by grocery stores and rice shops that ordered it from Lap Kee & Co. The price per bag is in accordance with the Shanghai Municipal Council regulations, at 122.91 yuan. Some rice merchants buy it from the market due to operational convenience.

Second Batch to Arrive Soon

Reporters at the Da Zhong News Agency learned from local shipping circles yesterday that after the arrival of the first batch of 6,000 bags of Hong Kong rice, the second batch will be partly carried by the Taikoo & Co.'s Guangdong vessel arriving today, and partly by Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Yusheng vessel arriving in Shanghai on the 19th. The Minsheng vessel sailing to Hong Kong yesterday, the Hanyang vessel sailing to Hong Kong today, and the Taiyuan and Jiangsu vessels sailing to Hong Kong tomorrow will continue to load Hong Kong rice to Shanghai. It is estimated that the total number will reach 200,000 or 250,000 bags this month.

Ordering Locations

Currently, the only place to order low-priced Hong Kong rice is Lap Kee & Co. at 220 Szechuan Road. If Hong Kong rice continues to arrive in Shanghai, Lap Kee & Co. alone may be overwhelmed. Therefore, the concession authorities have also entrusted 17 other grocery stores, such as Tai Run, to assist Lap Kee & Co. with the ordering process. The addresses of the 17 grocery stores are as follows: Tai Run, 22 Yong'an Lane, Yong'an Street; Da Heng, 1 Lihe Lane, Route Doumer; Xie Mao, 79 Avenue Edward VII; Da Yuan, 9 Tong'an Lane, Yong'an Street; Tian Shen, 16 Xuyuan Lane, Shilu, Fourth Avenue; Yu Xing, 49 Taihe Lane, Route Paul Beau; Yi Feng, 110 Rue Pere Froc; Da Cheng, 39 Avenue Edward VII; Xie Chang, 208 Route des Soeurs; Cheng Shun Sheng, 4 Yong'an Street; Rui Chang Fa, 53 Renji Lane, Xinza Road; Run Tai Feng, inside the Lao Dongfang Hotel, Sanwei Road; Yi Xing Feng, 20 Jingfu Lane, 31 Shanxi Road; Heng Feng Tai, 20 Jinlong Street, Fifth Avenue; Chang Yi Heng, 229 Zhonghui Building; Zhen Xing, 29 Rue des Missionaires; Hong Xing, 122 Ningpo Road.

French Municipal Council Orders Rice to Shanghai

The French Municipal Council, in order to suppress rice prices, has adopted the same approach as the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement, ordering a large quantity of rice from Saigon, totaling 50,000 bags of Saigon No. 2 rice. It is now learned that the first batch of 30,000 bags of government rice has been loaded onto a Norwegian merchant ship and is sailing to Shanghai, expected to arrive tomorrow (the 16th). The price has been determined to be the same as the standard price set by the International Settlement, not exceeding the limit of 110 yuan.

Rice Cart Distribution

For the past three days, over a thousand rice cart workers have been on strike to protest rice merchants' refusal to hire them to haul rice. Because the dispute has not been resolved, the workers continued their strike yesterday. The coolie workers accepted the authorities' advice, so no accidents occurred yesterday. Trucks also continued to transport rice as usual. However, to prevent any unexpected events, the Shanghai Municipal Council ordered police detectives to pay close attention to rice transport and the security of rice warehouses. At 2:00 PM yesterday, representatives from all parties were summoned for mediation, including Fu Qian'geng from the Rice Merchants Association, Wang Fuyuan, Liu Shouming, and Xin Faming representing the striking workers, and Li Guozhu and Zhang Maocai representing the truck drivers. As a result of the mediation, the rice merchants deeply feared the continued occurrence of rice snatching incidents. The cart representatives stated that truck transport could not avoid robbery either. However, if preventive measures are implemented (installation of railings), this situation could be reduced. However, the truck representatives could not accept the rice being distributed by the carts and requested a change to a mutually beneficial solution. After repeated persuasion by the authorities, the opinions seemed to be slightly closer. The formal solution is still pending further discussion today. It is expected that the dispute will be resolved today.

Reasons for Child Abandonment

According to the Pu Shan Cemetery, the rice price surge in October reached its peak, causing a sharp increase in civilian deaths from the high rice prices. As a result, the number of corpses collected and buried by the cemetery increased sharply last month, totaling 802 adult bodies, 1,139 child bodies, and 1,466 infant bodies. Among the infant bodies, some were still breathing, as their parents had no choice but to abandon them due to the threat of rice prices, in order to reduce the number of mouths to feed. The scene was so tragic it was unbearable to imagine.

Tea Coolie Steals Check

Withdraws Over 10,000 Yuan

Wang Chengli, a tea coolie from Cheng Chang Transport Company on Guangdong Road, stole a check, signed and stamped it, and fraudulently withdrew over 11,000 yuan before fleeing. He was arrested by the Central Police Station and taken to the First Special Court yesterday morning, where Judge Feng ordered him to be detained for further investigation.

### German Pilots Arrested En Route to Shanghai on President Garfield; Intercepted and Searched by British Ship; Four Arrested; Allegedly Under Orders to Go to Japan to Serve as Instructors

According to crew members, the ship was intercepted near Honolulu by the British auxiliary cruiser HMS Prince Robert. Several British naval officers and soldiers boarded the President Garfield and arrested four German pilots on board.

### Retirement of Head of the French Concession's Public Works Department, L'Oyrette; Inspects Troops Yesterday at Gu Kaizhi Park; French Consul General, Magre, Presents Medal

Captain L'Oyrette, the head of the Public Works Department of the French Concession, who has served in that association for nearly twenty-one years, is scheduled to retire from his post on the 15th of this month. The entire fire department held an inspection at Gu Kaizhi Park at 8:30 AM yesterday (the 14th). After French Consul General Magre, accompanied by L'Oyrette, completed the inspection, Magre delivered a speech praising the fire department's excellent work and expressing regret at L'Oyrette's retirement. At the end of his speech, he presented a medal to L'Oyrette in recognition of his leadership of the fire department. It is rumored that Lieutenant Bossu, who has assisted L'Oyrette for many years, may succeed L'Oyrette's vacant position. L'Oyrette completed his military service and came to Shanghai in 1920, subsequently joining the fire department. Now, upon his retirement, he is unable to return to Europe due to the unstable situation there, so he will temporarily remain in Shanghai.

### Conflict Between Dancer and Manager Resolved; No Legal Issues Arose

Wang Xiarong, a local dancer, was dancing at the Dahua Ballroom on Avenue Edward VII. The other night, she drank heavily with dance patrons, causing her to become drunk and create a disturbance in the venue. Chen Fuzhi, the manager of the ballroom, stepped forward to dissuade her, resulting in a conflict. The two nearly came to blows but were separated by people present at the scene. Wang Xiarong suffered minor injuries and went to Pao Lung Hospital for treatment. She only suffered superficial skin injuries, and after applying medicine and bandages, she was able to leave the hospital. Rumors of legal issues arising from this and Chen Fuzhi fleeing in response are not true. The case has been resolved through mediation by friends of both parties.

According to Xia's confession, the drug operation was opened by Chaozhou natives Li Hongsheng, Zhou Shouhua, the manager of the Donghua Hotel on Sanma Road in the International Settlement, and others named Zhu Xiaojiang and Cai Xiaokai. The French police, based on the confession, dispatched detectives to capture the aforementioned criminals at their locations. However, the criminals had already received the news and fled without a trace. The police department has ordered a strict search for the criminals, to bring them to justice.

### Young Russian Bandit Discovered in Hongkou; Steals Belongings of Jewish Man; Four Thieves Arrested on Yate Road

According to the Shanghai Times, at approximately 8:45 PM last night (the 13th), a German Jewish man was walking along Tangshan Road towards Fair Road when seven unarmed young White Russian bandits suddenly emerged from the roadside, blocked his path, robbed him of his belongings, and then fled in all directions. By the time the Jewish man called the police, the White Russians had already disappeared.

At 8:20 AM yesterday morning, five thieves suddenly broke into a house at No. 64 Liren Lane, Yate Road, Seward Road, Hongkou. Two of the thieves were armed with handguns.

### Quarrel Arises from Joking; Results in Assault and Death

Zhao Wenhua, a 40-year-old Jiangsu native and rickshaw puller residing at 691 Route Doumer, went out to pull his rickshaw on the morning of the 13th. At 11:30 AM, he went to Xu Jianxing's food stall (an Anhui native) at the intersection of Route Francis Garnier and Route Paul Beau to have lunch. A verbal dispute arose between him and Yu Jianliang (21 years old), a worker at the food stall, due to teasing and joking. The dispute escalated into a fistfight, with both sides punching and kicking each other violently. People persuaded them to stop, and they dispersed. Zhao then pulled his rickshaw home, but because he had been assaulted after having a full meal, his stomach was injured and in pain. He went to bed but did not recover. By 11:00 AM yesterday, Zhao's condition had worsened. His family reported it to the French Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. Zhao was sent to St. Luc Hospital, but he died within half an hour due to the severe damage to his internal organs.

### Numerous Abuses in Redemption Pawnshop Business; Difficulties in Tracing Stolen Goods; Resale Obstructs Criminal Investigations; Someone Actually Buys Over a Thousand Pawn Tickets

Chen Guisen, a Chinese detective from the Huishi Police Station, recently arrested a thief who confessed that the stolen goods had been pawned and that the pawn tickets had been sold to Feng Zenggao, a Shaoxing native who operates a pawnshop redemption service at No. 11, Lane 262, Beishan Road. The detective then arrested Feng and seized 1,228 pawn tickets that he had collected. This morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Court. Police attorney Qian Yijiu stated that this practice of redeeming pawn tickets for customers can affect the police's investigation of criminal cases because the pawn tickets are resold, making it difficult for the police to trace stolen goods. The large number of pawn tickets seized from the defendant must include stolen goods from theft cases. Therefore, he requested permission to postpone the hearing for investigation. Judge Dai核he reported to the magistrate, who ordered the defendant to be detained and the hearing postponed.

### Apostle of Christ

— Jiang Ping

It was a Sunday morning, and the beautiful sun urged me to get up early. I was proofreading a manuscript at my desk when suddenly I heard the sound of someone tapping on the door with their fingers. To my surprise, I found a Westerner of medium height standing at the door of the study. When he saw that I had noticed him, he walked straight to my desk without hesitation, forcing me to ask him in broken English what he wanted. He quickly showed me a red card encased in a soft glass cover, and I realized that he was carrying out the mission of Jesus Christ, coming to promote Christian books. He immediately took out two rather thick hardcover books from his large, old leather briefcase, and placed them respectfully in front of me, asking me to appreciate them. He said that the content of the books was so good that reading them would bring me many benefits, implying that I should buy his books.

I found that his English was not very pleasant to listen to. His clothes matched the identity of an apostle of Jesus Christ. Medium height, round face, with a tragic shadow hidden deep in his green, sunken eye sockets. I didn't need to ask him; I had already guessed his background.

Both of these books were written by J.F. Rutherford and published by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society at 731 Heath Road. One book was called "Riches" and the other was called "Enemies." He quickly turned to page fourteen of "Enemies" and pointed it out to me -

"After the World War, a zealous Hitler was embraced as the ultimate dictator and leader of the Nazi Party in Germany... Thus, the democratic politics of Germany came to an end... The Nazi Party under Hitler's rule, fearing the loss of power, continued to use cruel means to exercise its rule, killing or imprisoning those who did not openly support them. The people suffered because their material wealth had been plundered, their freedom and lives were threatened, and they were in extreme distress and panic."

This passage seemed to be written for him and others who had suffered the same fate. He pointed out this passage to me, perhaps wanting me to sympathize with him. I asked him if he was Jewish, and he said he was German; actually, he should be a German Jew. I felt that he didn't seem very honest.

"I don't want these books because I'm not a Christian." I flipped through a few pages and pushed the books back to him.

"The content of these books is very valuable, the printing is so exquisite, and each book only costs one yuan, which is so cheap; you have so many books on your desk, you should also buy these two books, which will bring you more benefits." Seeing many books piled on my desk, he insisted on praising his books to prompt me to buy them. On the other hand, he took out many thin booklets.

"Because I'm not a Christian, I don't want to read these books." My attitude was still very firm.

"You only need to smoke one less pack of cigarettes, take one less photo, and you can buy these books!" Seeing that I was smoking a cigarette and at the same time touching the photo under the glass panel, he said to me with a reproachful tone: "These are of no benefit to you!"

I was a little annoyed, but I still patiently said: "Photos are for me to appreciate and keep as a souvenir; cigarettes are enough to increase my work efficiency; how can they be of no benefit to me? I don't want to buy your books. Do you want to smoke?" I handed him a cigarette, but he didn't accept it.

Suddenly, an inexplicable thought appeared in my mind: Why don't I buy his books? Not to mention God, from a humanitarian standpoint, why can't I sympathize with him? My will had already wavered. I realized that he had been standing next to me for more than ten minutes, which seemed like I was being a bit cruel to him, so I asked him to sit down on the chair opposite my desk. He was overjoyed and sat very respectfully and solemnly opposite me with the usual Chinese politeness, a satisfied smile floating on his face.

Due to my detailed questioning, he told me that he had come to Shanghai a year and a half ago, had no job, and was selling these books for the church, which subsidized some of his living expenses. Due to the compassion that God has given to mankind, and due to the spirit of charity and mutual assistance praised by Jesus Christ, I finally bought these two books. When he got to the alley, he was driven out by the patrolmen. I imagine he gets driven out by many people every day.

Because the Nazis plundered their wealth, their freedom and lives were threatened, and they had to flee to the free city of Shanghai, so this "paradise" has added this group of "adventurers" who are fleeing for their lives.

### "Touching the Nasal Membrane" Amazing Technique Dr. Wei Dan Lowers Consultation Fees to Favor Chinese

In order for Chinese patients to enjoy his divine medical treatment, Dr. Wei Dan has specifically offered preferential consultation fees, so as to avoid disappointment and to spread the wonderful art of rejuvenation throughout the world. However, Dr. Wei Dan's new "Touching the Nasal Membrane" technique is not a cure for all diseases, and is only limited to the following conditions, so please pay attention.

(1) Asthma: This is a stubborn disease. Patients often become discouraged and disappointed, but after one application of this technique, the disease seems to disappear. Moreover, in some cases, the wheezing is greatly reduced or completely eliminated at the end of the procedure.

As for hay fever, which often causes sneezing, and chronic nasal colds with constant runny nose, this technique is also very effective in treating them.

(2) Nervous System Diseases: Headaches, dizziness, tremors, insomnia, etc., can be cured with several treatments. Those suffering from neurasthenia, who have lost control of their reason, are inexplicably depressed, and have unpredictable mood swings, will feel refreshed and restored to normal after treatment. At the same time, Dr. Wei Dan is also effective in treating those with mental illness. Those suffering from this often suddenly lose their conscience and have convulsive movements, which were previously considered incurable, but now there is a way to save them. Since Dr. Wei Dan arrived in Shanghai, he has treated many people with this disease. Dr. Wei Dan can also treat hemiplegia and Parkinson's disease, in which the muscles are stiff and the hands tremble.

As for paralysis, other doctors are helpless, considering it untreatable, and patients have also given up hope. Fortunately, they are cured by Dr. Wei Dan's divine technique, and many have regained normal movement of their limbs.

(3) Digestive System Diseases: Stomach pain, vomiting stomach acid, constipation, etc. are all treated.

(4) Pain: All kinds of pain, including rheumatism, stomach pain, back pain, etc., are all eliminated after treatment with the new "Touching the Nasal Membrane" technique.

(5) Delayed Development in Children: Delayed physical and mental development in children, resulting in unsteady movements and hesitant speech, is all caused by restlessness. Furthermore, those with nervous sensitivity can restore normal after one "Touching the Nasal Membrane" treatment.

From this, it can be seen that the above results can be achieved with only a small golden stick touching the nasal membrane, which can produce miraculous effects, which everyone considers a divine technique. However, Dr. Wei Dan does not boast of wonders, but takes pure science as his stance. He deeply knows that the hub that manages our health, the so-called "vagus nerve," is concentrated between the nasal mucous membranes, and once touched by Dr. Wei Dan's technique, it is immediately stimulated. His technique is actually based on the same principle as acupuncture, which has been used in China for thousands of years, stimulating various acupoints on the human body.

For the sake of prudence, Dr. Wei Dan must examine the patient before determining whether his technique is suitable. He does not rashly proceed with a treatment unless he is very confident that it will be effective. Therefore, the initial examination is free of charge, and patients are free to choose whether or not to receive treatment, which shows Dr. Wei Dan's benevolence and skill.

Those who wish to inquire can come to Room 707 of the Hua Pan Hotel on the Bund from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM daily (closed on Saturday afternoons and Sundays).

### Educational Inspector Talks About the Recent Situation of Education in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong.  Fujian's Educational Administration is Organized and Systematic.  Students in Zhejiang Province Seek Progress Through Hardship. Guangdong's Educational Director Is Seriously Rectifying and Making Progress

(Yong'an Correspondence) Wang Dexi, an inspector of the Ministry of Education, was sent to Fujian in mid-May of last year to inspect secondary education in Fujian Province. Mr. Wang arrived in Yong'an on June 2nd of last year and completed his inspection mission at the end of September last year, lasting a total of four months. He was then ordered to continue inspecting secondary education in Zhejiang Province, starting in early October and completing the inspection at the end of January this year. In February of this year, he was again ordered to go to Guangdong and Guangxi for inspection, starting in mid-February from Nanxiong and Shixing in northern Guangdong, passing through Qujiang and traveling along the Dongjiang, Xingning, Meixian, and Dapu areas. Recently, at the invitation of Zheng, Director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Education, he was invited to Yong'an to participate in a lecture at the training session for principals of secondary schools in Fujian Province. He immediately transferred to Yong'an and participated in the graduation ceremony of the training session on April 15th. He left Yong'an on April 17th to go to Guangdong and then to Guangxi for inspection. He is expected to return to the Ministry to report in late June. The reporter interviewed Mr. Wang at his residence and inquired about the educational situation in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces. He replied as follows: I was ordered by the Ministry to inspect education in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong for a total of one year. The educational situations in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces each have their strengths and weaknesses. In terms of Fujian, although the educational environment in Fujian is not as close to the war zone as other provinces and is relatively peaceful and unimpeded, the educational foundation has been weak in the past due to political turmoil. It is quite commendable that it can still develop daily on this weak foundation. Its advantages are: (1) the educational administration is organized and systematic, (2) the educational funds are stable and can be disbursed on time, (3) the inspection system is strict, (4) the equipment of each school is very suitable for wartime requirements, and (5) the educational progress is unmatched by neighboring provinces. The vigorous spirit of the members of this secondary school principal training session is admirable. In terms of education in Zhejiang Province, the cultural level of the province has surpassed other provinces in the past, and in theory, the progress of education should be faster than in Fujian Province. However, since the rich areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou were occupied by the Japanese, the administrative relations are complex due to being close to the war zone, and there are many difficulties in implementation, so the progress is not as good as in Fujian Province. Fortunately, the educational foundation of the province in the past was very strong, and all teachers and students can seek progress through hard work and struggle. Education in the province is quite universal, which is a special advantage of the province. In terms of Guangdong Province, its educational environment is the same as Zhejiang Province, and the implementation is hindered due to being close to the war zone. Its foundation is not as good as that of Zhejiang Province, and the quality is poor. However, the Educational Director Huang of the province has been seriously rectifying for two years, and it has also made progress.

### Introduction to Higher Education for Middle School Graduates (II)

— Zhao Chuanjia

Which university is most suitable for a middle school graduate to apply to? Of course, everyone has their own perspective. Some like public universities, some like private universities, or those run by churches. Some are willing to take exams for schools in Shanghai, Beiping, and Hong Kong, while others don't mind a long journey to Kunming, Sichuan, or Fujian. Publicly funded institutions naturally have sufficient funds, complete equipment, many departments, and concentrated talent. However, private institutions are often more serious about teaching because of their smaller scope, and the feelings between teachers and students are relatively strong. There are also many Taoist schools. In short, I think there are at least the following criteria for choosing a university: (1st) Choose a school that suits your interests, (2nd) What is the history and social reputation of the school you choose? (3rd) What is the reputation of the school authorities and professors? (4th) Is the equipment of the school you choose, especially the library, science, and sports equipment, complete? Other issues such as funding, transportation, and career prospects should also be listed as the final criteria. Now, I will list the locations, colleges, and departments of the relatively long-established universities one by one for reference. This is my personal opinion and is not perfect, so readers should choose other appropriate materials to cross-reference.

### Hess's "Paranoia"

— Jiang Hong

The sudden flight of Hess, a key figure in Germany, to England by plane has taken the world by surprise. Although it was a solo act, given his position, it will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the future of the global situation.

Following the incident, the German side initially claimed that Hess had "committed suicide," and then said that Hess suffered from "mental disorder" and had symptoms of "paranoia." "Suicide" requires factual proof, while "mental disorder" is easier to gloss over, so saying Hess had a "mental disorder" is obviously much smarter.

However, according to books on psychiatry, there are many types of "paranoia." Even the superstitions of African natives can be considered as "paranoia," but this kind of "paranoia" cannot be said to be a mental disorder.

True paranoia can be divided into the following types: (1) persecutory paranoia, (2) suspicious paranoia, (3) depressive paranoia, (4) grandiose paranoia, (5) sexual paranoia, (6) religious mania, (7) personality paranoia. If Hess has so-called paranoia, then it should belong to the first type. But if his views are based on facts, they cannot be said to be "paranoia."

As for saying Hess is "paranoid about being friendly with England," if this is really "paranoia," then it should be equated to the superstitions of African natives, and cannot be said to be a "mental disorder."

Career

### I Am a Female Worker

— Su Cao

I am a female worker. I work in a factory, earning a meager wage with a large amount of labor. The difficulties and hardships of life are imaginable. But who knows that there is even greater suffering in our lives!

The "Namo Wen" (foreman) possesses a kind of latent power: the "gentlemen"—the workers all call the staff "gentlemen"—almost listen and obey her; and we workers can only obey her orders. In order to win her favor, we have to curry favor with her, otherwise, she will say bad things about you in front of the "gentleman," causing the "gentleman" to punish you, and fire you. Therefore, in our monthly income, we have to economize in every possible way, extracting a portion of our blood and sweat as "social expenses" to maintain contact with her.

There are indeed many good "gentlemen," but there are also quite a few scoundrels. They often harbor despicable "intentions" towards young and relatively pretty female workers: they come to flirt at any opportunity. Unreasonable teasing is commonplace, and sometimes they even invite you to restaurants. To watch movies, visit parks..., if you sternly refuse, then they will use their positions to take shameless revenge: either nitpicking to deduct your wages; or reducing your wages; or making a fuss over a minor issue, scolding you in public, leaving you with nowhere to stand; they may even fabricate false charges against you...

There was a gentleman who was indeed very sympathetic to me, a young widow. He gave me a small amount of help, both spiritual and material: he knew that my monthly income had to support a family of three—I also have a mother-in-law and a child—which was very difficult, so every time he calculated my wages, he always added a little more; whenever there was extra work during the festival, he always assigned it to me so that I could earn more money. His treatment of me made me feel unspeakable gratitude. Who knew that this gentleman with a benevolent appearance actually harbored the heart of a snake. Gradually, the fox revealed its tail. It turned out that he also had despicable intentions towards me. When I expressed my refusal, he began to feel disappointed, and then shameless revenge was added heavily on me. I have no other way to resist, only to intensify my efforts in my own work. However, this resistance is too weak. Penalties for wage deductions and demerits are constantly pressuring me to surrender. Fortunately, my work performance is carefully calculated to be in the top tier, and many other gentlemen in the factory still know my performance, so he still cannot use trivial matters to fire me, leaving me with nothing to eat. However, in the past year, I have seen many new workers whose wages have increased time and time again, and each one of them has exceeded mine.

Exchanging extreme labor for extremely low wages and still not being able to live steadily, what is the reason for this? I think: perhaps this is my "fate"?

### Can Sleep Be Eliminated?

— Lini

The most regrettable thing in everyone's life is that sleep takes up at least one-third of it. It can be said that there is absolutely no one in the world who doesn't sleep. At most, there is a difference between sleeping more or sleeping less! Throughout history, medical scientists have often believed that sleep is necessary for human beings because it can restore tired bodies and minds. But is this view absolutely correct? If we further explore what the purpose of sleep really is, it may not be an uninteresting thing to do.

Professor Fred A. Mass, director of the psychology department at George Washington University in the United States, ordered four male and female students to stay awake for sixty hours. The results of the observation showed that sleep is a habit, and its state is similar to drunkenness. When the experiment ended, although the students felt very tired, their health was not affected at all. Professor Morse even wanted to determine the efficiency of work for insomniacs, so he ordered each person to drive a car after being awake for fifty hours. As a result, the work did not lose its effectiveness. Professor Morse himself only sleeps six hours a night, and his work spirit is not diminished at all.

Among the scientists studying the secrets of sleep, Columbia University psychology professor Dr. H. L. Holliwonrth) also made startling remarks, saying that in the future, human beings will develop and may become a "non-sleeping race." He advocated gradually reducing sleep time, and over time, it may be possible to not sleep at all. For example, reduce sleep by five minutes every two months. If you currently sleep eight hours, after sixteen years, you can completely not sleep. Professor Huo believes that sleep is a tragedy and can be regarded as other diseases. Professor Huo said that sleep is actually inherited from ancestors because in ancient times. Human knowledge was immature. After sunset, darkness followed, and it was impossible to continue activities. Since there was nothing to do, they naturally fell asleep to await the return of daylight. Later, it became a habit, passed down to their children and grandchildren, and became indispensable!

In addition, many scientists believe that sleep is a human habit, such as the experiment of Dr. Craven of the University of Chicago, which also proves that sleep can be completely abolished, or at least reduced to a certain minimum limit. Dr. Ke once napped for five days and four nights, a full one hundred and fifteen hours, and found that as long as the muscles were contracted as usual, it could drive away sleep. In addition, famous scientists Dr. Frazer Harris and Dr. AW. Crile, and Professor Arthur Cotton have all devoted themselves to studying methods to replace sleep. Professor Ge believes that sleep is due to the reaction of electrochemical action in brain cells. If an electrical machine can be invented to directly restore the activity of tired brain cells, then sleep will not be needed!

In short, regardless of whether sleep is one of our habits or a real need, it is a great pity that a person's life is occupied by it for one-third of the time. Great figures in ancient and modern times often slept very little. Edison's lack of sleep is well known. In addition, great heroes such as Napoleon, the German hero Frederick the Great, and the German poet Schiller, and the Italian writer Tassona, etc., were satisfied with only three to five hours of sleep each day. It can be seen that their achievements are not accidental.

Life is at most a hundred years, but one-third of the precious time is taken up by sleep. What a sad thing this is! No wonder scientists are trying to find a way to replace sleep!

But what is even more pitiful is that some people have already spent one-third of their time sleeping, and they let the other two-thirds of their time slip away in a daze. All of these people's lives are actually wasted! Therefore, before there is a method to replace sleep, in order to save time and rescue life, one should immediately intensify work quickly while awake!

### Pedicab Driver

— Li Yi

Due to the impact of the European war, Denmark is experiencing a severe shortage of gasoline, and private cars can no longer be driven. Wealthy merchants have come up with the whimsical idea of using tandem bicycles and hiring pedicab drivers to replace cars as a means of transportation. There were originally 1.75 million bicycles in the Danish capital, which has now suddenly increased to 3.8 million, it is said. This is also an interesting anecdote amid the sounds of the European war.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(8) Tangible Friendship

"But how can I be a human being in the future?" Before he could finish speaking, Begonia groaned like this.

Shaowen immediately sat down on the edge of his bed.

"Old brother, everything in the future is up to me!" He grabbed Begonia's eyebrows tightly and said, "Anyway, you didn't really want to act in operas. Don't act anymore in the future! As for that dog talent Ji Zhaoxiong? You watch: I will never let him go no matter what! At the very least, I can't let him live happier than you!"

When he said the last two sentences, there was a very clear indication in his voice, which made Begonia know that he would definitely put it into practice soon.

Begonia was not an unreasonable person in the first place, and Shaowen's explanation to him was so detailed and kind, of course he could no longer make things difficult for his good friend of many years.

The next afternoon, when Shaowen went to the hospital to see him again, he met the chief surgeon in the corridor.

"Your younger brother's wound will probably not fester again."

The doctor said, "It's just that he can't sleep well, as if he has a lot on his mind; it's not good for us to give him sleeping pills often, this has a great impact on the wound and the body. It's best if you can persuade him!"

However, this point was not something Shaowen could persuade, and he only expected half of Begonia's thoughts: in his thoughts, Begonia was always remembering Luo Xiangqi, but he did not know that he still had an even bigger concern—that was his sick daughter. (106)

### A Page of Blood and Tears in the History of Yue Opera

— Junmei

I once read "Weitan" written by Zhu Zhishan of the Ming Dynasty, which said: "The branch of Kunqu Opera, passed down from the Song and Yuan dynasties to the Ming Dynasty, is divided into two types: manchuo and stringed music. The ancient sounds are gradually lost. Those that spread to the north are called Yiyang tune, Gaoyang tune, etc., mixed with the sounds of the northern Yan. Those that spread into Han are called Congyang tune, and those that spread into Huguang are called Xiangyang tune." Zhishan was a Ming Dynasty person, and what he said was the actual situation at the time. Therefore, those who talk about the spread of drama today, whether it is Peking Opera, Cantonese Opera, or local operas in various places, it can all be said that they evolved from the Kunqu Opera of the Song and Yuan Dynasties. As for which came first and which came later, the records of drama figures, both public and private, are slightly different, and it is not possible to make arbitrary speculations.

Recently, this journal published an article by Mr. Gu Mei on Peking Opera and Shaoxing Opera, stating that Shaoxing Opera evolved from the Southern Opera after the Anning of the Southern Song Dynasty. His meaning seems to coincide with the above. The author once heard it from Qian Junyun, an old musician of our county who has passed away. "Yue Opera originated in the late Ming Dynasty. At that time, there was peace for a long time. The members of the imperial family stationed in various prefectures lived in luxury, with abundant food and clothing, and had nothing to do. They spent their days with silk and bamboo music, and sensual pleasures. When the Ming Dynasty collapsed, those who were once so-called golden branches and jade leaves and carefree all turned into prisoners. Those stationed in prefectures were uniquely spared because they usually immersed themselves in drama, were proficient in music, understood singing, and had no lofty ambitions. However, they were ordered to have men permanently be horn blowers and women permanently be wedding singers. That is what they bought as "fallen people"! This group was forbidden to marry people of other surnames, and they were not allowed to study or participate in the annual examinations. The path to becoming an official was cut off, so they had to seek a living in the opera that they had become addicted to on weekdays. Thus, Yue Opera became very popular. The current Shaoxing Opera is actually its advanced form. In the beginning, the descendants of the imperial family stationed in the Yue area were very attached to each other. They lived separately for many years. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, they feared being exterminated, so many changed their surnames to seek survival. When the pardon decree was issued, many still did not dare to publicly state their real surnames. Therefore, the surnames of the "fallen people" were very mixed. As time went by, even their descendants knew very little about it." Therefore, the development process of Yue Opera does contain a page of national blood and tears history. Recording it is also to mourn the ancients and lament the present!

### Ba Yu Comes to Say Box Office

— Ruoqi

Mr. Liang Xiaohong has served in the postal service for many years. He plays opera in his spare time and follows the Wanhua style. He is one of the famous Qingyi amateur actors of the Shanghai school. Since entering Chongqing last year, he has been honored to hold a position in the aviation industry. Old friends have been separated for a long time, and he is deeply missed. Unexpectedly, a letter arrived yesterday afternoon, describing the situation of the local amateur opera circle in great detail. Therefore, the letter is published to the entertainment industry, so that enthusiasts in Shanghai can know a glimpse of the amateur opera circle in the accompanying capital.

"The amateur opera circle in Chongqing is very active. Over the past six months, charity performances have never stopped. The number of amateur actors is no less than in Shanghai. Among them, the most popular ones are: with the roles of Yang Wannong, Rong Boming, and Wang Zhenzu, with the roles of male characters Zou Gongfu, Zhang Fenglou, with the roles of martial arts actors Zhang Quan, Zhou Zhibin, with the roles of young male characters Wang Zhenou, and with the roles of Jing characters Tie Zheng. The piano players are Zhou Zhenfang, Guo Yunzhi, Gao Yinlv, and Qiao Junfu. I am already familiar with most of the amateur actors, and I go to listen to every performance, which is very enjoyable. Wannong's voice is enviable. I have seen her perform "Life and Death Hate," "Wujia Slope," "Spring and Autumn Match," "Battle of Puguan," and "Sitting in the Palace," etc. Her voice is consistent from beginning to end, and her makeup is also absolutely flawless, only her body is slightly inferior. Wang Zhenzu, the owner of Xiaoyun Pavilion, has only appeared once here, performing the complete "Phoenix Returns to Its Nest." His singing and acting are excellent, but his makeup is too old. Except for the Yuanban and Liushui tunes, the rest of his slow-paced Nanbangzi, etc., are not the original tunes of Mei Wang. As for his costumes, curtains, etc., everything is fully prepared, and the scale is rare in the amateur opera circle. There are also many better amateur opera groups in Chongqing, such as the Chinese Opera Group of the New Transport Agency of the Ministry of Communications, the Hengshe Chongqing Branch, the Yage Collection Travel Chongqing Branch (sponsored by Zhu Lianfu), the Zhengfengshe Amateur Friendship Society, and the Chrysanthemum Society Chongqing Branch. After I came to Chongqing, I have appeared in "Baolian Lantern" twice, "Wujia Slope," "Battle of Puguan," and "Visiting Mother" several times. The airline originally had the Tongren Opera Group in its spare time, which has now been changed to the China Aviation Branch Chinese Opera Group of the New Transport Coordination Association of Transportation Employees. I have been appointed as the drama director. This can be said to be 'Liao Hua filling the role of a vanguard in the absence of a great general.'"

### Luo Ke Returns to the Screen

— Yong

Luo Ke, the comedic genius who was once as famous as Chaplin, has been absent from the silver screen for a long time since the film "Professor Beware"; during this period, although we have not been able to see his style on the screen, according to news reports, Luo Ke was responsible for directing a film, titled "A Man, A Girl, A Gob."

Recently, Luo Ke has the intention to return to the film industry, and it is said that his first new work has been determined to be "My FoVourite Spy"; Luo Ke's return to the silver screen will be unanimously welcomed by all sectors, but we hope that Luo Ke can take good care of himself, otherwise he will ruin his future and will be ridiculed by the world.

### Anecdotes from the Movie City

— Zhaoji

Recently, Hollywood rumors that George Brent and the girl Ann Sheridan have been married in Mexico, but they both immediately made statements denying it. In fact, George Brent has had a lot of romantic news. Last year, it was rumored that he was getting hot with Bette Davis, and recently it was rumored that he was having a big romance with the mysterious girl Garha, but now he is indeed closest to Garbo and Sheridan.

Marx Freud, a Hollywood makeup artist, believes that the beauty and charm of female stars do not diminish with age, and are even more eye-catching than when they were younger. He personally pointed out that Irene Dunne, Garson, Margaret Sullavan, Joan Crawford, and Nauma Shearer are all like this. These female stars are all over thirty years old. Marx believes that women around twenty years old are most likely to express their youthfulness.

Since being affected by the European war, the market for American films has shrunk, so they have flocked to develop in South America. South Americans like to watch films starring Errol Flynn and James Cagney, and their favorite female star is Bette Davis, who was recently elected as the film queen by a South American film publication.

Since its reorganization a few years ago, Universal Pictures has made rapid progress in all aspects. Not long ago, Sithman, the company's vice president, announced this year's film production plan, which includes Diana Durban's new film. Irene Dunne and Carol Slaughton have one each. Charles Boyer and Margaret Sullavan, and Margaret Sullavan and Philantong each have one co-starring film. Carol Landis, George Raft, Loretta Teti, and Marlene Dietrich also each have a new film.

This column has previously reported a lot about Diana Durban's marriage and various things after marriage. Here I will tell you a little about the news of "Skating Queen" Song Ya Hainei's marriage to New York's young rich man Tan Tuoping, and Song Ya Hainei's future career.

Their wedding date was July 4 last year. Whether she would continue to make films after her marriage, and the news of Diana Durban's marriage to Feng Baoluo, were all of great concern to movie fans. Song Ya Hainei herself replied to this question: "There are quite a few people outside who think that after I marry Tan Tuoping, I will withdraw from the film industry. In fact, this is not true. Maybe I will have this intention in the future, but at least in the near future, I will not leave the film industry and the skating business. My career is currently going very smoothly. If my work is not satisfactory, then I will not stay in the film industry." Of course, what she said about being unsatisfactory is her box office appeal.

Now that she has a stable and happy family life, of course she no longer needs to show her beauty again. So as we see it, it is probably impossible for Song Ya Hainei to re-enter the film industry.

Chapter 9: I Pity You, Why Have You Come to the Ends of the Earth?

After saying that, he put on the Scarlet Phoenix Sword and packed his luggage, quietly walked out of the Wang family gate, stepped onto the avenue, and walked out of the city gate step by step. He had no fixed destination in his mind, only cared about walking towards remote places, gradually leaving the bustling area and reaching the mountains and fields. It was already near the hot summer, and the scorching sun was like fire, making him sweat all over. Seeing two elm trees by the roadside, with thick shade covering the ground, just a good place to cool off, he put down his burden under the elm trees and sat on the ground. Sure enough, two cool breezes blew, making his spirit refreshed. He lowered his head and thought about how this time he had left his hometown and come here, only wanting to take advantage of the chaotic times to establish some fame. Wang Yongtai was his father's friend and a senior hero. Getting him to promote him in front of General Zhou was a good opportunity, who knew that such an unexpected fork in the road would arise out of thin air? That demon concubine was extremely venomous, and when her seduction of me failed, she immediately came up with a poisonous conspiracy, speaking ill of me in front of Wang Yongtai, driving me away, and from then on, she and the one surnamed Sang could be unscrupulous, not afraid of others revealing their secrets. I shouldn't say how Wang Yongtai was so old and confused, listening to a woman's words, and actually issuing an order to evict guests, so the ancients said that only women and villains are difficult to raise. Immersed words, skin accusations, even for parents, they would change their minds, let alone for the son of an old friend? Naturally, he easily believed her eloquent words. But I, Xu Jing, am a good man who stands upright. Suffering such a unjust grievance, how can I just walk away? No matter what, I must make Wang Yongtai thoroughly understand the truth, and regret his mistake, and also remove his future hidden dangers. Moreover, I am grateful to General Zhou Yuji for employing me, if I abandon him and leave, where else would I meet such a good general? So I cannot leave Daizhou. Then where should I go to find a place to stay outside the city gate? Stay in an inn? My wallet is shy, and I don't have enough food for a few days. Go to General Zhou Yuji's office? Because of Wang Yongtai's relationship, I should also temporarily not meet him, so as not to embarrass Wang Yongtai. It would be best to have a Zen temple where I can temporarily stay, so I should go to the mountains to look for it. So he sat for a while, stood up, carried his package, and went into the mountains. The mountain path was winding and tortuous, and the scenery was very secluded. Xu Jing was single-mindedly looking for a Zen temple, but there were very few residents in the mountains, and he could not find it for a long time. Just now, after walking over a ridge, a fierce wolf suddenly窜 out from a pine forest by the roadside. Xu Jing knew that this animal was going to bite people, and hurriedly put down his package, pulled out his Scarlet Phoenix Sword, and prepared to defend himself. When the wolf saw a stranger, it really pounced fiercely towards Xu Jing. Xu Jing shouted, "Evil beast, how dare you hurt people!" and waved his sword, stabbing the wolf. One person and one wolf fought fiercely under the ridge. Suddenly, a dart flew out of thin air, hitting the wolf's neck with a clang. The wolf howled and immediately fell to the ground in the grass. Xu Jing lowered his head to take a closer look, and the dart had pierced through the wolf's throat, shooting a hole, and blood was flowing all over the ground. The wolf died. (63)

### A Summary of the Philosophy of Diligent Practice

— Zong Yu

Giving up oneself and belittling oneself are different. Oneself is a useful tool. When it is time to use it, in the place where it should be used, one should generously use it. This is giving up oneself. Squandering it casually and not cherishing it at all is belittling oneself. For the sake of society and the country, if I have a point of heat, I will release a point of light. This is being good at giving up oneself!
