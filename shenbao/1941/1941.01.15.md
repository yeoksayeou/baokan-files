Therefore, after we return, we will have a better understanding and knowledge of China and the Chinese people. We will make full use of this knowledge and understanding in the best possible way to arouse greater interest among the Burmese people in China. May the friendly relations between the two neighboring countries of China and Burma be restored to their former close and cordial state. Because we are journalists, we have the opportunity to see many things. We firmly believe that China, in its resistance against aggression, should receive more sympathy and assistance from Burma and India. After examining China's various reconstruction movements and economic development plans, we are even more convinced that China will achieve final victory. I hope that this victory will bring China and its people peace and prosperity. Among the many countries in the East that are not yet fully independent and free, a better democracy will be born. I also hope that the Yunnan-Burma Highway, which is helpful to China, can become a golden chain, making the commercial and cultural relations between the two countries even closer. Therefore, the two countries can enjoy peace and prosperity in the coming centuries. We are very grateful for everyone's warm hospitality. We tell you that the Burmese people are fully sympathetic to and supportive of China. We will help China until her victory comes. (Telegraph dated 14th)

### First Time This Year: Japanese Planes Attack Chongqing; Bombs Dropped in the South Bank and Hechuan; American Journalists Alarmed

Chongqing: At noon today, Japanese planes carried out the first air raid of the year on Chongqing, dropping bombs and strafing with machine guns in the South Bank and Hechuan north of Chongqing. Although there are no detailed reports yet, it is said that the Japanese planes entered Sichuan in two batches, each batch consisting of nine planes. One account says that a total of twenty-seven Japanese planes participated in the air raid, with nine planes in the first batch and eighteen in the second batch. The air raid sirens sounded here at 11:00 a.m. At noon, the first batch of light bombers appeared over the city, circling for some time. Some Japanese planes strafed with machine guns over the western suburbs, and several planes flew low, strafing a small, unused aircraft of the CNAC parked at the commercial airfield. Other planes flew to the South Bank to drop bombs. At that time, all the CNAC's regularly scheduled aircraft had taken off before the raid and landed safely at other temporary airfields. Mr. and Mrs. Mydans, photojournalists from Life Magazine in America, had just arrived in Chongqing shortly before the air raid. Their plane was unable to land due to heavy fog and was circling in the air when the air raid sirens went off. Fortunately, the pilot remained calm and managed to land before the emergency alert, and then took off again before the Japanese planes arrived to avoid danger. (Reuters telegram dated 14th)

Yesterday, at Barkley, 95 miles west of Vientiane on the border, infantry from both sides exchanged gunfire. (Reuters telegram dated 14th)

Singapore: The Thai consul here told a Reuters reporter that the French minister to Thailand left his post last May and was transferred to Venezuela. The post of French minister to Thailand has been vacant ever since, preventing Thailand from negotiating with the French. While Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam has expressed his willingness to negotiate, the Thai government cannot recognize the appointment of a Vietnamese official as the successor minister because Vietnam is not a sovereign state and the Thai government cannot negotiate with it. (Reuters telegram dated 14th)

Hanoi: Regarding the Thai-Vietnamese border conflict, the following information has been released here: (1) On the 11th of this month, Thai artillery shelled the city of Savannakhet on our side.

Representatives from both sides are currently discussing specific issues one by one. He also said that rumors of a Thai plane being shot down by French anti-aircraft fire and that it was a Japanese plane piloted by a Japanese person were probably not true, and that no Japanese aviators had volunteered for the Thai army. (Reuters telegram dated 14th)

Hanoi: Officials recently announced that after Thai planes bombed French outposts along the Mekong River, French aircraft retaliated on Sunday of last week by bombing the Thai military bases of Takphanon and Namkeim, 30 miles south of the Thai city of Rakhon.

Tokyo: When Information Bureau spokesman Ishii met with foreign visitors, he was asked whether Japan's policy on supplying war materials to both countries had changed after the outbreak of the Thai-Vietnamese war. Ishii acknowledged that Japan had sold several small gunboats and other warships to Thailand some time ago but claimed that it had not sold large quantities of war materials to them since then. Japan has no actual connection with the Franco-Thai war. (Reuters telegram dated 14th)

### Major Turning Points in the International Situation

Observing the development of certain facts, as well as the indications suggested by many signs, it appears that the international situation is once again on the eve of a major unfolding. Although various opposing or complementary forces are actively brewing, it is impossible to predict the future shape for the moment; however, there are fundamental key points that are clearly visible and unwavering.

The first key point is the issue of war between the United States and Japan. The biggest issue of concern to the world now is undoubtedly the recent actions of the United States that have shaken the globe. What is the central meaning behind them? In President Roosevelt's fireside chat, he clearly answered: the United States opposes the so-called "new order" and will use aid to China, Britain, and Greece as a means to avoid the United States being drawn into the whirlpool; however, the United States has the determination to join the war as a last resort, and is therefore taking all necessary measures. This conversation can only be regarded as the beginning of the United States' declaration of a major resolution, and the aid to democratic nations bill in the US Congress is its initial concrete plan. From now on, there will inevitably be many more solid and courageous measures that will follow. Therefore, on the side of countries creating a new order, there is a current topic, namely, war with the United States. Specifically, the navies of Germany and Italy are now mostly blockaded by Britain in the North Sea, and in the sea areas between the Strait of Gibraltar and the Port of Aden; although there are still some German submarines and warships in the Atlantic and South Pacific oceans tasked with attacking merchant ships, they are fundamentally unable to engage in any naval warfare. For this reason, Germany and Italy are currently unable to directly confront the United States; even if the Allied Tripartite Pact breaks with the United States. In reality, only Japan is independently engaged in this risky work; and the recent massive concentration of the US Navy in the Pacific is precisely aimed at Japan. Observing the various signs from the Japanese side, it is conceivable that Japan does not want to take this great risk. It is now only adopting a policy of temporary safety, temporarily not giving a direct answer to the United States, waiting for the evolution of the European war, waiting for further actions from the United States; but if it does not abandon its aggression, it will inevitably not be able to always evade and dodge, and sooner or later, it will have to directly answer the question of whether or not to go to war with the United States.

The second key point is the issue of German-Soviet relations. Generally speaking, in this European war, the Soviet Union has consistently provided material assistance to Germany, while in public opinion, it has exclusively accused the British side of being an imperialist war. The degree of intimacy and estrangement between the two sides is extremely blatant; however, after Germany gained an advantage in Europe, and the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan was formed, proclaiming the establishment of a "new order," the relationship between the three countries and the Soviet Union inevitably underwent subtle changes! Although for more than three months, due to various diplomatic maneuvering, the situation has remained unchanged and there has been no significant change, this cannot be hastily regarded as a natural tranquility. Just as the situation in the Balkans is continuing to ferment, how can the problem be minimized or eliminated? Broadly speaking, the relationship between the Tripartite Alliance and the Soviet Union is truly a strange and delicate realm. For example, just in the last two days, the Soviet Union on one hand extended its material exchange agreement with Germany, and on the other hand, it is said that a contract for the exchange of a large amount of materials with China has also been signed; on the Chinese side, it is of course understood that the Soviet Union has such powerful goodwill, but on the side of the Allied Tripartite Pact, it is no different from a debit and credit offsetting each other. How long will this phenomenon last? No one can make a prediction; and the factors that are sufficient to cause this phenomenon to change are readily available. For example, the issue of Germany's further control of the Balkans, and the ebb and flow of the military situation caused by the unfolding of the European war, are all closely and significantly related to the Soviet Union, making it necessary for the Soviet Union to reconsider and resolve to take action at any time. If based solely on the current situation, it is possible to simply infer that if the two groups of wars in the East and West do not merge into one, then the Soviet Union's basic attitude will inevitably be to treat them separately; on one hand, strengthening its support for China and severely attacking Japan, and on the other hand, under the condition that Turkey does not enter the whirlpool, it will still side with Germany. If the two groups of wars merge into one, then the Soviet Union cannot remain on the sidelines for long, and to say that the Soviet Union will assist in the success of the so-called new order is absolutely unimaginable.

The third key point is the issue of the Anglo-Italian war. Based on the recent trends in the military situation of Britain and Italy, at least two points can be affirmed: Britain is indeed determined to concentrate its forces and defeat Italy first, that is one; the possibility of Britain realizing its determination is far greater than the possibility of Italy turning defeat into victory, that is two. Now, the only factor that could cause the greatest change in the Anglo-Italian war is Germany's prompt action; either a fierce attack on Britain to disperse British forces, or aerial assistance to Italy, or a blitzkrieg in the Balkans, and so on. If Germany cannot act early, and Italy is defeated first, then the unfolding of the entire future international situation will fundamentally change. This point is a major pivot at present.

The three points mentioned above are the key factors that will determine how the international situation will evolve in the next immediate stage; but they are only issues of the form of the next stage, and their final destination is undoubtedly the disillusionment of the so-called dream of a new order.

### US Aid to Democratic Nations Bill Submitted to Foreign Affairs Committee for Discussion; Government Wins House Vote; Republican Party Internally Divided

Washington: It is learned that the bill to aid democratic countries will be publicly discussed in the House Foreign Affairs Committee today. Those invited to attend include Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, Secretary of War Stimson, and Secretary of the Navy Knox. The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to consider the bill tomorrow. (United Press telegram dated 14th)

Washington: The House Foreign Affairs Committee has postponed its review of President Roosevelt's proposed Lend-Lease bill until tomorrow. The reason for this move is that Secretary of State Hull and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau are unable to attend today. Taft, a prominent member of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, is fully committed to immediately abandoning this bill and will propose a counter-proposal stipulating that cash be loaned to Britain if necessary. It is said that the most important event before Congress is to refuse to grant such broad powers to the president and to avoid confusing the British issue with US national defense. He believes that when Britain's assets are exhausted, loans should be granted to Britain. (Reuters telegram dated 14th)

Washington: News today is that the division of opinion among Republicans on the "Lend-Lease" plan has given President Roosevelt's unprecedented bill more hope of being passed by Congress. (United Press telegram dated 14th)

Washington: The Aid to Britain bill passed its first hurdle in Congress yesterday. The House vote has allowed the bill to be submitted to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The efforts of the Military Affairs Committee to have the bill handled by them have been rejected. The House vote took place without debate because House rules do not allow discussion of this issue. When the meeting convenes today, Secretary of State Hull will be the first to attend and express his opinions. There is widespread support for the suggestion that Britain should allocate most of its US dollars as collateral for the war materials obtained under the Lend-Lease plan. The influential Washington Post also supports this proposal, but says that we cannot forget former Secretary of the Treasury Mellon's statement during the war debt debate that good European customers are worth more than the value of all the war debts. Should we increase the poverty of Europe, causing it to become a major problem not only for Europe but also for the United States? It seems appropriate to use a portion of Britain's overseas assets to purchase food and raw materials necessary for restoring Europe's post-war vitality, as post-war famine must be prevented. Since the Aid to Britain bill is supported by the government and the vast majority of Democrats, and former Republican presidential candidate Wilkie also supports it, this has caused a split within the Republican Party. Wilkie's future position and influence in the Republican Party may be determined by this. Will the majority of Republicans still follow Wilkie's lead, or will they break away from Wilkie and return to the Landon and Hoover factions? This remains to be seen. Newspapers have generally praised Wilkie. The Baltimore Sun, a well-known Republican newspaper, has also criticized Wilkie, saying that Wilkie's cultivation of the principles of the Aid to Britain bill and his demand for guarantees that the powers granted to the president under this bill will eventually be returned to the people are actions that transcend party affiliation. (Reuters telegram dated 14th)

Washington: Yesterday, a Republican Congressman from New York State introduced a new Lend-Lease bill in the House, the content of which is slightly the same as that proposed by the President, except that it stipulates that US aid only applies to the British Empire and Ireland. This aid may not be extended to other countries without the consent of Congress. It also stipulates that the powers granted to the president under this bill will expire in two years. According to this new bill, it was proposed by the Congressman after a telephone conversation with Wilkie. Wilkie has already stated that he approves of President Roosevelt's proposal but with amendments attached. (Reuters telegram dated 14th)

Washington: Speaker of the House Rayburn told reporters yesterday that he did not oppose setting a time limit on the powers granted to the president under the Aid to Britain bill, provided that the time limit ends with the end of the emergency situation. (Reuters telegram dated 14th)

### America May Use British Islands in the Pacific; Two More Officers Arrive in the West Indies to Prepare for the Establishment of Naval and Air Bases

Washington – Regarding the suggestion to demand certain guarantees from Britain in exchange for the aid provided under the Lend-Lease plan, it is heard that members of Congress here are currently discussing Singapore and islands in the Pacific. It is heard that some suggest the United States should obtain from Britain strategically important islands in the Pacific, such as the Gilbert Islands, the Ellice Islands, the Phoenix Islands, and the Tokelau Islands. These islands form an arc encircling the Japanese-mandated territories and have harbors suitable for American naval and air bases. Some also suggest that the United States should obtain certain rights in Singapore to protect British and American interests in the Pacific. Congressional leaders are likely to agree to the acquisition of Pacific islands, but the issue of sharing rights in Singapore will likely provoke opposition from isolationists, who believe that this is more about aiding Britain than protecting American interests. (Reuters, 14th)

West Indies, Leeward Islands – Two American personnel arrived here at the end of last week in Antigua to prepare for the establishment of American naval and air bases in the vicinity of Crabbs Peninsula. The two men, Johnson and Smith, are both officers in the U.S. Marine Corps. They will be considering the construction of docks, hospitals, dormitories, and barracks. The Governor of the Leeward Islands, James, has issued construction permits. It is expected that three American officers will arrive with fifty sailors at the end of this month to begin construction. (Reuters, 14th)

### Britain to Sell Assets in America to Pay for Purchased Aircraft

Washington – Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated to the press today that Britain may sell its assets in America to pay for armaments or other munitions. The Treasury Secretary said the Treasury Department has already investigated the situation of various British investments in the Western Hemisphere and the United States. These assets may be used to purchase munitions from the United States. The Treasury Secretary stated this matter is currently underway. Britain may sell its direct assets in the United States to acquire funds for the purchase of munitions. These assets refer to factories and stores. He also said that the investigation of British assets in America began several months ago when representatives from over twenty countries were sent here to negotiate the purchase of military supplies. (United Press, 14th)

Washington – U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said yesterday that the British government is currently in contact with several groups of American investment companies regarding the sale of British investments in the United States. One group has already made an offer, and another group made an offer today. British Treasury representative Phillips has stated that the British government is prepared to transact with them. However, it is not yet convenient to announce the value of the securities Britain intends to sell or the identity of the company that intends to purchase them. It should not be difficult for the British government to sell all its American securities in accordance with normal stock exchange transactions. (Reuters, 14th)

### Japanese Cabinet Met Yesterday Morning and Decided to Revise Election Law

Tokyo – According to a semi-official Japanese source, the Japanese cabinet met this morning and decided that the Japanese government would not discuss the proposal to establish an East Asian Federation Association, as such an association would obscure Japan's sovereignty. In the construction of a Greater East Asia New Order, it is not appropriate to propose a federation association of Asian countries. The cabinet also decided that all activities of groups aimed at constructing a Greater East Asia New Order must adhere to the spirit of the joint declaration of the Japan-Manchukuo-Wang Jingwei regime of November 30. All ideals and actions in Japan regarding the construction of this new order must be guided by the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. (Reuters, 14th)

Tokyo – When Information Bureau spokesperson Ishii met with foreign reporters, he was asked if the revision of the election law could not be submitted to the Diet as scheduled, would the election scheduled for May be postponed, and would the term of office of the current Diet members be extended by one year? Ishii replied that the government has decided to revise the election law. If the revised law is not promulgated, the current election law will remain in effect. (Reuters, 14th)

### Japan to Make Proposals to the Dutch East Indies; Ishii Says Japan-Soviet Fisheries Negotiations Are Delayed

Tokyo – Information Bureau spokesperson Ishii stated to foreign reporters today, when discussing Japan's recent diplomatic negotiations, that Japan will make proposals to the Dutch East Indies government within days, but has not yet done so. Japan-Soviet fisheries negotiations are still delayed. He also said that Japan is prepared to reciprocate the friendly sentiments expressed by Australian Minister for the Army Spender. According to Japanese sources in Singapore, when that official toured Singapore's base on the 11th of this month, he said in a radio broadcast that Australia sincerely wished to maintain friendly relations with Japan. Ishii said that Mr. Spender's remarks were good, and we intend to reciprocate Australia's goodwill. (Reuters, 14th)

### Soviet Union's Current Policy Controlled by Two Ideologies: Profiting from Opportunities While Avoiding Involvement in War; Germany's Nerve War in the Balkans Fails

London – "The Times" reports that since the signing of the German-Soviet Pact, Soviet policy has been controlled by two ideologies: the desire to seize profits from the war and the fear of being drawn into the whirlpool of war. Currently, the second motive outweighs the first. It is very clear that the Soviet Union does not want to see Hitler win and dominate in Europe and the Near East. This phenomenon has gradually disappeared over the past few months. Soviet newspapers have repeatedly expressed admiration for Britain's resistance to the German air war and confidence in Britain's strength in both offense and defense. Repeated victories in the Mediterranean have had a considerable impact, and the most powerful impression is the increasing determination of the United States to aid Britain. (Reuters, 14th)

London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that in the past 24 hours, the Soviet Union and Bulgaria have issued important official documents clarifying the situation in the Balkans in the near future and dispelling Nazi rumors about the Balkans having been settled by Germany and Italy, or the Soviet Union having allowed German troops to pass through Bulgaria. From this perspective, although some German troops are stationed in Romania to protect oil fields, the claim that a large German army is concentrated in Romania is likely inaccurate. The Soviet document was issued after the signing of the economic and northern border treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany, stating that the scope of this treaty is very limited and explaining that the reason why the Balkans were not mentioned at all was not an omission, but because no agreement had been reached on this issue. The Bulgarian announcement was made by Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov a few days after returning from Vienna, reiterating Bulgaria's peaceful and neutral policy and implying that the Soviet Union would help Bulgaria recover Dobruja, and repeatedly stating that neither the Nazi nor the communist system of government is applicable to Bulgaria. At a time when Nazi agents are promoting a nerve war in the Balkans, Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov's uncompromising remarks show that although there are rumors about the instability of the Bulgarian Prime Minister's position, Germany's plan to overturn the balance of power in Bulgaria has failed. (Reuters, 14th)

Bucharest – Rumors that German troops have entered Bulgarian territory via Romania have been firmly denied by responsible parties in both Bucharest and Sofia. Political figures here also said that the German troops in Romania are currently concentrated on the north bank of the Danube and have not crossed the river into Bulgaria. As for the Soviet attitude, although the country is willing to cooperate with Germany, the Soviet Union has no intention of accepting any constraints on the Balkan issue if German troops pass through Bulgaria. (Havas, 13th)

### British and Turkish Hold Staff Talks; Berlin Does Not Attach Importance

Ankara – When Lieutenant General Cornwall, representing the British forces in the Middle East, and Air Vice-Marshal Elmhirst arrived here yesterday to participate in staff talks with the Turkish General Staff, General Çakmak, Chief of the Turkish General Staff, and General Ergan, Deputy Chief of Staff, welcomed them at the scene. Admiral Kelly, the personal representative of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet, accompanied the British representatives. The British representatives then visited Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu with British Ambassador to Turkey Knatchbull-Hugessen. (Reuters, 14th)

Berlin – A senior German official told foreign reporters today that the current British-Turkish staff talks and political talks in Ankara are probably just routine meetings of the British-Turkish alliance and are unlikely to have surprising objectives. Britain may attach great importance to these talks for special reasons, but Germany does not attach importance to this meeting. (Haitong, 14th)

### Bulgarian Reserve Artillery Conscripted; Bulgarian Prime Minister Meets German Envoy

Sofia – The Bulgarian Minister of Defense ordered yesterday to conscript reserve artillery soldiers of the 1940 class. According to past practice, reserve artillery soldiers are conscripted on March 1. This time, the call-up was brought forward. (Haitong, 14th)

Sofia – Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov met with German envoy Baron von Richthofen yesterday, who recently arrived here from Germany. (Haitong, 14th)

### British Aircraft Continuously Raid German Submarine Base; Large Number of American Aircraft Arrive One After Another; British Air Force Strength Doubles

London – Last night, the British Air Force attacked the German submarine base in Lorient again. Heavy bombs hit naval buildings and docks. Some British aircraft also bombed the Dunkirk area, causing one large fire and several small fires. All British aircraft have safely returned. (Reuters, 14th)

London – The British Air Force has recently expanded its offensive and is engaged in continuous day and night bombing. Therefore, the news that four different types of American bombers are currently flying across the Atlantic to join the British Air Force is of particular interest. A large number of several types of American aircraft have arrived in Britain, and more will arrive in the future. The four types are the Lockheed Hudson long-range reconnaissance bomber, assigned to the Coastal Command; the Boeing B-17 four-engine bomber, commonly known as the "Flying Fortress"; the Consolidated twin-engine seaplane; and the Lockheed Vega Ventura bomber. This type of aircraft is larger than the Lockheed Hudson and flies even faster. (Reuters, 14th)

### British Prime Minister to Deliver Broadcast Speech Involving Pacific Events; Australian Prime Minister to Visit London

London – News yesterday stated that Prime Minister Churchill will deliver a broadcast speech to British India within days. It is heard that Mr. Churchill will mention Pacific events in his speech. (United Press, 14th)

Melbourne – It was recently announced by Australian Prime Minister Menzies that he will soon go to England to discuss matters with Prime Minister Churchill and other cabinet members. He believes this trip will be welcomed and will have real value for the conduct of the war. During Mr. Menzies' absence, Treasurer Fadden will temporarily act as Prime Minister. (Reuters, 14th)

### Nazi Aircraft Launch Air Blitz in Mediterranean; Numerous British Warships Reportedly Destroyed

(Mediterranean) A British warship, a British destroyer, and patrol ships sank an Italian destroyer in a pursuit battle on Friday. German aircraft then stepped up their attacks on the British fleet in the central Mediterranean. The battle on that day continued from dawn to dusk. German dive bombers concentrated their attacks on this warship at that time. (United Press, 14th)

(Rome) Official sources here announced last night the recent activities of the German and Italian air forces in the Mediterranean over the past five days, stating that one British cruiser and two submarines were sunk. Two British merchant ships, the "Anastasia" and the "Shakespeare," were sunk in the Atlantic. One Malaya-class cruiser, one Birmingham-class cruiser, one cruiser of unknown class name, two destroyers, two aircraft carriers, and four merchant ships were hit and destroyed by bombs in the western Mediterranean. German aircraft hit one cruiser, one aircraft carrier, and one destroyer. (Haitong, 14th)

(Rome) It was announced here yesterday that on the 10th of this month, German aircraft braved the bad weather and bombed the British Navy between Sicily and North Africa with considerable success. The weather has been bad in recent days, with heavy fog and continuous rain. British warships have taken advantage of the weather to hide between Sicily and the African coast, making it extremely difficult for aircraft to detect enemy ships. However, German aircraft took advantage of breaks in the fog to quickly attack and returned after achieving their objective. After the weather improves, the joint German and Italian air forces will be in a favorable position to bomb the British Navy in the Mediterranean. (Haitong, 14th)

(Sweden) A dispatch from a newspaper in Stockholm cites Berlin as saying that Berlin is currently spreading rumors that Germany will launch an air blitz in the Mediterranean. However, it is clear that the German military headquarters is attaching increasing importance to the Mediterranean war. A military correspondent for another newspaper, in reviewing the Italian military's defeats, said that the German army is unlikely to change the situation in Albania and Libya. For mechanical reasons and for the sake of Italian prestige, the German army may not be transported into Italy. It would be extremely difficult for the German army to transport troops through Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, especially if resistance is encountered and Turkey helps this resisting country. (Reuters, 14th)

### British and Australian Troops Reinforce in Droves; Siege of Tobruk Intensified; Italian Troops' Retreat Cut Off in Cyrenaica; Emperor Haile Selassie Leads Restoration Movement

(London) British and Australian troops are still concentrating in preparation for a final assault on Tobruk. Tanks, mechanized units, and heavy artillery are arriving in droves. At the same time, British aircraft continue to bomb this Italian fortress like rain. (Reuters, 14th)

(Cairo) It is reported that an Italian division is trapped in the Cyrenaica grasslands about 150 miles south of Tobruk, and their retreat has been cut off. It is believed that this unit was intended by Italian General Graziani to attack the Siwa Oasis on the Egyptian border. However, since the Italian troops retreated from Bardia, the Italian troops stationed in the Cyrenaica grasslands are in a dangerous situation. A few days ago, the British Air Force bombed the Italian transport in the northwest of the grasslands. However, it was not clear whether this unit was retreating from the grasslands or intending to reinforce the grasslands. The strength of the Italian troops trapped in the grasslands is also unknown. In the rugged desert, the sound of artillery fire is deafening. British artillery continues to bombard the Tobruk defense zone in preparation for a final assault on the city. There is no sign of how many Italian troops are trapped in Tobruk, but it is believed that the number is far less than the Italian troops besieged in Bardia, and the defense of their positions is also more difficult than in Bardia, because the outer defense line covers a wider area. (Reuters, 14th)

(Khartoum) Emperor Haile Selassie of Abyssinia is currently residing in a small palace near the Blue Nile in Sudan, waiting for the right moment to cross the border into Abyssinia and lead the patriotic Abyssinian army to expel the Italian troops. Insurgents are increasing in Abyssinia. The Emperor recently convened a meeting of local chieftains in the interior of Abyssinia on the Abyssinian border to jointly plan the restoration of the country. Therefore, the patriotic Abyssinian army in the border area of Abyssinia now beats drums every night to send signals. When the Abyssinian people hear it, they all know that the Emperor is nearby and the day of liberation is not far away. (Reuters, 14th)

### President Roosevelt's Mysterious Envoy to the Libyan Front

(London) President Roosevelt's "mysterious envoy," former commander of the 69th Fighter Squadron of New York, Colonel Donovan, has reportedly left Cairo for the British front in Libya. (Reuters, 14th)

### Greek and Italian Forces in Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat on the Tepelene Front; Italian Commander-in-Chief Replaced Again

(Tepelene Front) Yesterday, Greek and Italian forces engaged in fierce combat on the Tepelene front in freezing rain. The falling rain froze as soon as it landed on people and guns. As a result, the narrow mountain roads were covered in ice, making marching extremely difficult. During the engagement, Greek forces threw grenades at the Italian forces. The Greek and Italian forces were only separated by a narrow path 300 feet wide. Because the distance was so close, the Italian forces could not bomb the Greek forces with aircraft. Greek aircraft also distributed leaflets in the Italian rear, advising the Italian troops to surrender to avoid losing their lives. Although the rain continued to fall, Greek reinforcements continued to arrive. (United Press, 14th)

(Rome) News yesterday stated that General Cavallero replaced General Soddu as the commander of the Italian forces in Albania but will continue to serve concurrently as the Chief of Staff of the Italian Army. (Note: General Cavallero was appointed Chief of Staff on December 6, 1940, after General Badoglio resigned.) (United Press, 14th)

### Overseas Department Urges Overseas Chinese to Join the Malayan Volunteer Army; Malaysia and China Have Close Relations; Overseas Chinese Should Pay Attention to Local Security

(Singapore) The Overseas Department in Chongqing urges overseas Chinese in Malaya to join the Malayan Volunteer Army or participate in military training. In the current world situation, military training is extremely important. It also stated that overseas Chinese in Malaya have obligations and responsibilities to the Malayan government in times of emergency. It is inappropriate to shirk this responsibility to the military and police. Protecting life and property is also an action that overseas Chinese should take. The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Consul-General should assist overseas Chinese in participating in local defense. Since the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, Japan will take the opportunity to advance southward. Moreover, Malaya and China have close relations. Therefore, overseas Chinese must pay attention to local security. (Fourteenth Reuters)

### German Aircraft Fiercely Bombarding London; Incendiary Bombs Raining Down; Portsmouth Severely Affected

(London) Last night and early this morning, a large number of German aircraft dropped thousands of high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs on a town in southwestern England. The casualties and losses are believed to be significant. It is widely believed that the town is Plymouth. German aircraft flew through intense anti-aircraft fire and dropped countless incendiary bombs for many hours. A hospital, a church, and two ground air raid shelters were destroyed. (Fourteenth International News Agency)

### American Red Cross Medical Supplies Continuing to be Transported to China; Yunnan-Burma Road Open and Unobstructed

(Washington) The American Red Cross announced that its medical supplies have now arrived in the free areas of China, so the Red Cross will continue to ship supplies. Since the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, American relief supplies have been transported to China and are now unobstructed along this road. According to the Red Cross investigation, although the road has been subjected to air raids, it remains intact. Fifty trucks loaded with medical supplies have already passed through. Therefore, the United States will continue to transport relief supplies worth one million US dollars, stating that there are no restrictions on aid. (Fourteenth Reuters)

### The Current Stage of Deteriorating US-Japan Relations

Wilfrid Fleisher, the publisher of the American newspaper Japan Advertiser in Japan, also served as a correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune in Tokyo for nine years. After he sold the Japan Advertiser to the Japanese, he returned home and published this "uncensored report," which is translated as follows:

Experienced diplomatic observers in Tokyo unanimously believe that although Japan does not want to go to war with the United States, Japan often overreacts to certain specific issues or unexpected events, which is enough to cause conflict. Therefore, although no one believes that Japan will directly challenge the United States, radical elements in Japan may urge the government to take some action, thereby provoking war.

From Japan's perspective, the most dangerous problem in the Pacific is the future of the Dutch East Indies. Japan is currently pursuing its so-called "Southward Advance Policy," which has long been advocated by the Japanese Navy and used to oppose the Army's Northward Advance Policy targeting the Soviet Union. The current policy of the Konoe government is to abandon its suspicions and reconcile with the Soviet Union, and to do its best to eliminate any possibility of Soviet attacks from the north, so that Japan can shift its full strength to the South Sea Islands to realize its opportunistic attempt to seize them.

Before the German invasion of the Netherlands in April last year, the then Japanese Foreign Minister Arita attempted to probe the attitudes of various countries regarding how they would react if the status quo of the Dutch East Indies changed. At that time, US Secretary of State Hull immediately issued a warning, stating that any change in the status quo of the Dutch East Indies would "not only harm the peace and tranquility of the Dutch East Indies, but also harm the peace and tranquility of the entire Pacific." The firm and rapid response from the United States greatly surprised Japan.

However, Hull's warning was an insinuation that any violation of the Dutch East Indies would be enough to cause a Pacific war, or would the United States still follow the precedent of Japan's invasion of Manchuria and various parts of China, and only issue a protest. This question remains elusive to the Japanese.

The US State Department's advice to overseas Chinese in the Far East to evacuate back to their country has made a deep impression on Japan. No other action by the US government in the past ten years has made such a deep impression on Japan. People from all walks of life in Japan have been deeply shocked. The Japanese have first and foremost felt that the priority in the Pacific is not something that Japan can monopolize, and they know that the United States is prepared to fight Japan if necessary. Although the Japanese government intends to minimize the impact of this feeling on the people's minds, the impression that the Japanese people have formed cannot be erased.

When the report of the US advice to overseas Chinese in the Far East to evacuate first reached the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Foreign Ministry official Ohashi immediately summoned US Ambassador Grew and asked whether the news was reliable and why the US government had taken this action. Ambassador Grew no longer equivocated and honestly told him that the Tripartite Pact signed by Japan, Germany, and Italy had demonstrated Japan's position. Foreign Minister Matsuoka and Prime Minister Konoe then delivered speeches one after another, declaring that Japan was prepared to work with Germany and Italy to establish a "new world order," and if the United States interfered, Japan would not hesitate to fight. All these threats were very irritating to the American sentiment.

As things reached this point, Matsuoka decided to issue a declaration to appease the feelings of the Americans. He personally drafted the declaration in English and handed it over to the Information Department of the Foreign Ministry to distribute to foreign newspaper reporters. However, the Information Department translated it into Japanese first and published it in domestic newspapers, allowing foreign newspaper reporters to translate it back into English from Japanese. In this way, Matsuoka found that the wording of his declaration was even more decisive than the original meaning. According to his declaration, the Tripartite Pact "does not directly attack any country, nor does it serve to provoke the United States. If the United States or other countries are unfortunately drawn into the vortex of war, it is a great catastrophe for mankind. Therefore, the Tripartite Pact can be said to be a treaty to ensure peace."

Before I bid farewell to Tokyo, Matsuoka told me that the treaty was aimed at restraining the United States from participating in the European war, thereby preventing the expansion of the European war. If the United States were to participate in the war, the war might be prolonged for ten years. Since there was no possibility of Japan and the United States forming an agreement, there was no other way to follow except to join the "Berlin-Rome Axis." You Americans hope that the Japanese army will withdraw from China, or at least withdraw a large part of it. You should know that this is impossible. Japanese public opinion will never allow this."

Matsuoka also said that he really couldn't understand why the US government advised overseas Chinese in Asia to evacuate. It was nothing more than a political action related to the US election. It is also unbelievable that Japan intends to take action against China or Britain after the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road. Part of the reason for American panic may lie here.

Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horinouchi has been recalled to his country amid a major reshuffle of Japanese envoys abroad. Matsuoka looked for a successor, and only recently decided on former Foreign Minister Admiral Nomura. According to Matsuoka, the cabinet suggested that he himself take the post of Ambassador to the United States, but he was too busy to make it happen. He originally had two candidates in mind, one was Nomura, and if Nomura insisted on not doing it, then he would send Taiwan Governor-General Admiral Kobayashi to take over.

Nomura's initial unwillingness to serve as ambassador to the United States can be traced back to his past when he served as foreign minister in the Abe cabinet in December two years ago. At that time, he conducted negotiations with US Ambassador Grew in an attempt to resolve various outstanding issues. After many negotiations, he fully recognized the US position on Far Eastern issues and felt that the policies of the two countries were very different and difficult to compromise. The Abe cabinet was unwilling to make many statements other than vaguely indicating that it could reopen the Yangtze River. Later, Ambassador Grew only submitted a memorandum stating the preconditions for the United States and Japan to renew their commercial treaty, and the negotiations ended in failure. The failure of Japan and the United States to renew their commercial treaty also became a major reason for the collapse of the Abe cabinet. (To be continued)

(Da Hua News Agency) In order to rectify the student status of middle schools in this city, the educational authorities have issued notices to all schools to handle student transfer matters carefully. They have stipulated the format of transfer certificates and entrusted the Zhengzhong Bookstore in Fuzhou Road, Fuxingli to print and sell them (they will be available for sale in one week). They have also stipulated a "Points of Attention for Issuing Transfer Certificates," and have issued notices for uniform compliance. The original plan will not be issued separately.

### This City's Educational Association Yesterday Sent a Letter to School Authorities to Find Ways to Protect Teachers' Jobs and Substantially Increase Teachers' Salaries

(Da Guang News Agency) This city's Educational Association yesterday issued a letter to school authorities, stating that the environment in Shanghai is harsh, and the problem of livelihood is even more serious. At the end of this semester, school authorities should embrace the spirit of sharing weal and woe, and have compassion for those who are hungry and those who are drowning. Unless there is a major reason, do not easily change teachers. Teachers in various schools work hard to teach and strive to do their jobs well. During the holidays, they are able to rest a little. Moreover, when they are employed, their income is meager, and it is difficult for them to make ends meet. The hardship of their lives is unprecedented. If they lose their jobs, their future will be even more worrying. It is hoped that you will abide by the President's clear instructions to provide relief to teachers, earnestly maintain the livelihood of the original teachers, and improve the treatment of teachers as much as possible within the possible range, or arrange group purchases of rice on their behalf, or give special year-end rewards, so that they will not have to worry about being cold or hungry at the end of the lunar year and the approaching Spring Festival, and will not have to worry about losing their jobs. Teachers will be able to encourage themselves to work harder and serve diligently in order to seek the development of the school. It is hoped that we can all share the difficulties of the times and overcome the difficulties together.

### The Teaching Strike at Xingzhong Still Unresolved Yesterday; Relevant Parties Hope for an Immediate Resumption of Classes

The teaching strike at Xingzhong Elementary and Middle School in this city, which was caused by the failure to meet the demands of some teachers for increased salaries, has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the educational authorities sent personnel to the school yesterday to mediate, preparing for a quick resolution. Unexpectedly, eight female teachers have already left the school, making it impossible to proceed. It is earnestly hoped that the teachers will first return to school to resume teaching this morning. All conditions will be mediated by the educational authorities. If either party continues to stall, they will be dealt with according to the law, so as not to let the students waste their studies.

First, Yuan Ludeng delivered the opening speech. After Dai Chunfeng reported on the process, Yang Ziyong played the guqin, performing tunes such as "Drunken Fisherman Singing at Dusk," "Autumn Clouds Chanting," "Pu'an Mantra," and "The Way of Great Learning," which were melodious and pleasant to the ear. The masterpieces of ancient and modern celebrities hanging in the hall were beautiful beyond compare, and the audience praised them endlessly. Among them, the couplets by Ma Gongyu, Dai Chunfeng, and Lu Yuanding, Fan Zhixuan's tiger, Sun Choucheng's poems, and Xue Foying's remaining stones were particularly noteworthy, attracting viewers one after another, no fewer than a thousand people.

### Finance: Demand for US Dollars Near and Far

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices showed no changes. The black market for British and American dollars was slightly tighter. However, in the morning, due to the pouring out of dollars by HSBC and other British banks, the price of American dollars was reported to be flat and the price of British dollars was loose. After the Hua Bank's demand for US dollars increased, the price began to soften. The price of US dollars fell from $5.53125 to $5.50. Speculators in the aftermarket had an appetite to buy, but the amount was still small. In addition, foreign banks supplied dollars, so the situation only appeared to be tight at first. As a result, the final closing price of British dollars was 3 shillings and 4.6875 pence, and the price of US dollars was $5.50, each shrinking by 0.015625 and 0.025 compared to the previous day.

HSBC Still Dumping

At the beginning of the morning, the exchange rate between the British pound, the US dollar, and the Shanghai dollar was half and half. The US dollar remained unchanged against the British pound, rose by one point against the Shanghai dollar, and had no market against the French franc. The central bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 3 shillings and 4.84375 pence for British gold and $5.53125 for US dollars, which were the same as the previous day's closing price. The same was true for futures. After opening, Japanese banks first had an appetite to buy, while HSBC and other British banks continued to supply dollars as before. Japanese banks then bought spot pounds at a cheaper price. It is estimated that HSBC, McCallie, and the Japanese bank all offered 3 shillings. Hua Commercial Bank also once offered spot pounds at a price of 3 shillings and a half. At 9:30, HSBC's listed price was announced to be unchanged. The silver tax did not rise or fall. Afterwards, foreign banks sold spot US dollars to American banks such as Chase Manhattan for $5.53125, while speculators at the time followed suit and sold forward US dollars, which were absorbed by Hua Commercial Bank for $5.50. After 11:00 am, speculators stopped selling, but Hua Bank and others still had an intention to buy, so the underlying trend turned soft. By the noon closing, the spot price of British gold was still 3 shillings and 4.84375 pence, and the price of US dollars was $5.50, which was 0.0335 tighter than the morning opening.

Afternoon Trading Gradually Scarce

In the aftermarket, speculators scrambled to buy near and far-term US dollars. With supply and demand uneven, the trend was relatively brisk. It is estimated that foreign banks sold US dollars for next month to speculators for $5.46875. Later, British bank McCallie once offered speculators US dollars for this month at $5.50. After this, trading gradually became scarce, and prices rarely rose or fell. The evening closing price for spot and this month's pounds was 3 shillings and 4.6875 pence, and the price of US dollars was $5.50. The price for next month's pounds was 3 shillings and 4.53125 pence, and the price of US dollars was $5.46875, which was 0.015625 and 0.03125 tighter for near and far-term British and American dollars, respectively, compared to the previous day's closing price.

Hong Kong US Dollars Tight

Hong Kong, 14th (Tuesday) Electricity. The exchange market opened flat this morning, with the British and American dollars at 50 cents, or 428 yuan and 50 cents. At 10:05 am, the spot price of US dollars tightened by 0.0625, to 23 yuan and 6875 cents. At 11:30 am, it was reported to be flat. There were no fluctuations in any currencies. The market opened flat at 2:30 pm. There were still no ups and downs in any currencies.

Tianjin British and American Dollars Also Shrank

Tianjin, 14th (Tuesday) Electricity. The exchange market was sluggish this morning. The London telegraphic transfer shrank by 0.03125, to 3 shillings and 84375 pence. The New York telegraphic transfer also shrank by 0.03125, to 6 yuan and 09375 cents. The Shanghai dollar rose by 1 cent and 3 points, to 90 yuan and 3 cents and 8 points. The black market for "Joint Bank Notes" was cheaper by 7 cents and 5 points, to 82 yuan and 7 cents and 5 points.

### Gold Market Driven Up by Swap Arbitrage, Largest Premium at 230 Yuan, Roughly Equivalent to Over Three Percent Monthly Interest

Yesterday, "cooked red" (熟赤, slang for gold trading) dark market experienced significant fluctuations in swap prices, with prices rising and falling erratically. The underlying trend suggested a downturn, but the final swap premium reached as high as 160 yuan, pushing the February settlement price to 6516 yuan, a 91 yuan increase from the previous day. The morning opened at 6430 yuan, then fluctuated to 6455 yuan. The afternoon saw only 6417 yuan. The designated swap period was from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM. Initially, gold shops offered a premium of about 80 yuan. Later, when the market opened, banks offered premiums, reaching a high of 230 yuan, equivalent to an interest rate of over two percent per month. The listed price was 105 yuan. Those offering the premium were mostly money exchange businesses. The February forward price was thus pushed up to 6580 yuan. Subsequently, exchange houses and banks sold, bringing the price down to a low of 6515 yuan. The closing price was 6516 yuan. At that time, port banks offered a premium of around 160 yuan. Total daily trading volume was approximately 6000 taels. Gold jewelry shops listed prices at a small premium of 10 yuan, at 650 yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.

"Cooked Red" February Futures Already Listed

Initially, market sentiment was influenced by the swap, leading to mixed buying and selling, and prices remained high. Banks first traded 10 taels at an opening price of 6430 yuan, 5 yuan higher than the previous day. Later, banks and gold shops engaged in both selling and buying, pushing the price down by 10 yuan, with banks buying 20 taels from gold shops at 6420 yuan. Subsequently, it was rumored that securities firms were buying, driving the price up to 6455 yuan. At that time, off-market swaps were rumored to be active, with gold shops offering money exchangers a premium that rose from 70 yuan to 98 yuan, but trading was scarce. Later, money exchangers, gold shops, and banks all sold, bringing the price down to 6415 yuan, with money exchangers selling 10 taels to banks. By the afternoon close, a certain bank made slight purchases, stabilizing the price, with the bank trading 10 taels at 6417 yuan. The designated swap period was from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM. Initially, gold shops were heard offering 80 yuan, but there were few transactions. Later, banks offered a premium as high as 130 yuan. Shortly after, a money exchange house offered to buy back at a lower rate of 100 yuan. However, before long, bulls found it difficult to find counterparties, and banks offered money exchangers a premium that rose to 230 yuan, with some transactions occurring. By the time the market opened later, the February forward price had reached as high as 6580 yuan. Subsequently, due to selling by banks and exchange houses, the price fell to 6515 yuan. Later, the price was pushed up again to 6530 yuan by small, scattered buyers. At closing, banks traded 10 taels with each other at 6516 yuan, a 91 yuan increase from the previous day, but 69 yuan lower when excluding swap figures. The daily fluctuation was 165 yuan. Furthermore, after closing, the swap premium had fallen back to 160 yuan, with banks still offering premiums. The selling price of gold from the gold shops' official list was over 10 yuan higher than the "cooked red" price, while the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current benchmark gold price was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed price, with little trading activity.

Jewelry Gold Listed Higher in the Afternoon

The exchange price for gold jewelry in jewelry shops was changed to 650 yuan at 2:05 PM in the afternoon, with the buying price about 30 yuan lower, it was said.

### Minimal Fluctuations in Foreign Currencies

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the "cooked red" price surge due to swap activity. British and American gold pounds also followed suit, rising by one yuan. British gold drafts remained stable, with the market price holding steady. American gold drafts reached a high of 18.28 yuan in the afternoon, but then fell back to 18.03 yuan, a slight increase of one cent from the previous day. The supply of Japanese gold drafts was abundant, and the market price weakened, falling to 1.58 yuan in the evening market. Korean drafts suddenly saw demand, and the market price strengthened, rising to 1.21 yuan in the evening market.

### Food: Rice Market Activity

After the foreign rice market saw another drop, the opening price yesterday morning saw prices of various goods depreciating by one yuan. Unexpectedly, this drop suddenly triggered buying from local stores, and the situation gradually became active. Broken rice was particularly strong, as the selling prices of all types of rice had fallen within the price limits. The lowest price on the previous day was about 10 yuan lower than the highest premium price a month ago, ranging from a little over one thousand yuan. The highest price for mixed broken rice was over 80 yuan, while the lowest was only around 60 yuan, a difference of about 20 yuan. The price difference for low-grade goods sold in the confusion was even greater than this figure. Therefore, due to the low price, it triggered small purchases by households in the city and surrounding areas. Yesterday's transaction volume of broken rice was three to four thousand bags, and the price immediately fell by one yuan. The small "絞" (jiao, a type of rice) previously sold for 70 yuan opened at 71 yuan yesterday. "Red Pagoda No. 2" Saigon also reached 79 yuan yesterday. The prices of other types of rice all followed suit, increasing by several cents to nearly one yuan. The original Ying Wah Si (英華司) packages that no one inquired about the previous day were also being sought after by customers. Although the price changes were small, the market was indeed active. The opening prices for small "絞" were 80 yuan for January 16th, 86.5 to 87 yuan for December 9th, and 81.4 yuan for February, with a transaction volume of six to seven hundred tons. The transaction volume of current rice was over ten thousand bags. New transactions included Nissin (日信) selling 500 tons of small "絞" for February at a price of 80 yuan, and 500 tons of small "絞" for January at a price of 80.05 yuan, it was said.

The arrival of thick and thin "粳" (jeng, a type of rice) domestic rice remained limited. However, the thick "粳" sales market was slightly more active because stores used it more widely, and a stable situation had emerged. "崑山斛" (Kunshan Hu, a unit of measurement) saw white "粳" opening at 100 yuan, and lower-grade at 97 yuan. "無錫斛" (Wuxi Hu) saw high "粳" at 101 to 102 yuan. Thin "稻" (dao, a type of rice) continued to see weak demand, and prices continued to fall by about one and a half yuan. "靑角斛" (Qingjiao Hu) only opened at 96.5 to 95.5 yuan.

Glutinous rice remained in a dull and lifeless state, with a transaction volume of only twenty to thirty "石" (shi, a unit of measurement), so there were no changes in the market.

Foreign rice continued to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo (太古) company's "南寧" (Nanning) ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon with 8,277 bags loaded from Hong Kong, docking at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. (祖)

### Flour Market Weak but Stable

Yesterday's flour market saw continued weak sales to local customers. There were plans to lower prices, but the sellers argued that rice prices had risen slightly, and there was no certainty about the future source of foreign flour, so they were unwilling to sell too cheaply for the time being. Overall, the market was active, with over two thousand bags of "Flower and Bird Clock Tower" brand Australian flour and over one thousand bags of "Blue Mark" brand foreign flour shipped from Hong Kong. The price of "Flower and Bird" was 23.4 yuan, and the price of "Blue Mark" was 23.2 yuan. The market was gradually entering a state of preparation. Chinese factories supplied over four thousand bags of cheap flour, still priced at 21.5 yuan, which were distributed to designated stores on various streets.

Wheat remained in a stagnant situation yesterday. A new shipment of foreign wheat had arrived for the Chinese factories, and the supply on the market was exhausted. There was little demand from buyers. The purchase price at the Japanese factory's store was slightly higher than the original price. The quoted prices on the market varied, and the demand from factory customers did not seem to be strong, so it was difficult to finalize transactions.

### Securities: Class D Bonds See New High Prices

Yesterday's public bond dark market saw prices decline as large bulls sold off. At the same time, the number of buyers also increased, so the decline was limited. This was entirely due to the large bulls releasing their holdings. Class D bonds even reached a new high price of 67 yuan. The future market price may temporarily decline, but it will eventually rebound. Yesterday's trading saw very enthusiastic buyers, but large-scale selling suppressed any price increase. Yuxing Sheng, Da Yu, Zhong Hong, Da Tong, Kang Lian, He Jiu Feng, and No. 25 all saw buying activity. Although Yu and Sheng Da sold again in the afternoon, the demand for Da Tong and Kang Lian became stronger. However, both Xinfu and Delong saw early and late selling, and the market price fluctuated constantly. In the end, only Class D bonds saw a slight increase of 5 cents, while the rest declined by a small amount, ranging from 10 cents to 35 cents. The transaction volume was still over 3 million yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.

Stock trading saw the transaction of 100 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company stock at a price of 19.5 yuan.

Tena Malaya Rubber Estates, Limited, managed by the British firm Jardine Matheson & Co., Ltd., announced yesterday that it would pay an interim dividend of 20 cents per share in national currency, for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1941, starting on January 21st.

London, January 13 (Monday) - Today, the listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks remained flat. Only the stock of The Mercantile Bank of India, London and China fell by 2 shillings and 6 pence, to a price of 8 pounds and 5 shillings. The rest remained unchanged.

### Oilcake: Hoarders Turn to Selling, Rise in Oil Market Has Weakened

Yesterday's oil market still rose by over one yuan at the opening due to support from sellers, but as actual demand was average and many scattered hoarders turned to selling, the market slightly declined. As a result, raw soybean oil rose by several cents to nearly one yuan compared to the previous day. It was reported that 30 pieces of Jiaozhou Xinsheng oil were sold at a price of 99 yuan, 1800 cans of Jiangbei raw oil were sold at a price of 133 to 132 yuan, 70 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were sold, with old stock priced at 134.5 to 135 yuan, and new stock at 136.5 yuan. 120 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were sold at a price of 120.075 to 121 yuan. February forward contracts were priced at 124 to 125 yuan. 100 "dan" (担, a unit of measurement) of local factory soybean oil were sold at a price of 96.5 to 96.75 yuan. 250 barrels of Japanese factory soybean oil were sold at a price of 95 yuan.

In addition, 1,465 bags of soybeans and 500 pieces of oilcake will be shipped to Singapore today (the 15th). Another 255 bags of soybeans and 7,300 pieces of oilcake will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Yarn and Cotton: Speculative Buying Very Strong, Yarn Prices Rise Again, Factories Offer Over 2,800 Bales

The yarn market remained strong and prices high, and market sentiment was very strong. As for actual sales, demand for 32s and 23s yarn from Hong Kong had surged, and small banks were increasingly inclined to buy. However, foreign exchange remained quiet. Nevertheless, there was some speculation that the gold swap would perform well, so speculative buying was particularly strong. The high price for 20s Double Horse yarn was 1,414 yuan, and the low price was 1,395 yuan. The market continued to rise in the afternoon. The starting price was 1,417 yuan, and the stable price was 1,407 yuan. Someone sold, and Shenxin No. 2 Factory offered 1,000 bales of 20s Tiannv at a price of 1,300 yuan. Tongyi Factory offered 1,000 bales of 23s Jinlan at a price of 1,375 yuan. Both were for March delivery.

Double Horse yarn opened in the morning with continuing good sentiment from the previous afternoon. The opening price was 1,403 yuan. However, sellers looking to profit sold off, causing a slight decline to 1,395 yuan. Subsequently, driven by speculators and scalpers, aggressive buying drove the price straight up to 1,414 yuan. Midway through, it was heard that foreign exchange was stable, and the market seemed to loosen, causing a fallback to 1,396 yuan. However, after the close, buying interest suddenly increased, and the price rose again to 1,405 yuan. It was found that 6,800 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 20s Double Horse yarn rose by 8 yuan. Yongan Factory offered 300 bales of 20s Jincheng yarn at a price of 1,300 yuan, and 530 bales of 32s Yucheng yarn at a price of 1,630 to 1,640 yuan. In addition, 220 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today (the 15th), and 40 pieces were shipped to Siam. The amounts bought by each group are listed on the left.

Same Industry 6,100 Ningbo 15
Statistics 6,800 Hong Kong 785

### Shenxin Purchases Fine Cotton

The current cotton situation is also becoming more active, with Shenxin No. 2 Factory's purchases being the most robust. However, 32s and 42s raw materials are the most popular. The contract price for 20s Indian cotton raw materials remains favorable to the factories. The factories are mostly buying directly from overseas, so the price increase is relatively gradual.

In other news, the New York cotton market initially declined in the morning due to selling by speculators. Although purchases by the public later caused it to recover, the subsequent selling by Southern sellers caused it to fall back again. As a result, the closing price was 4 to 9 points lower than the previous day. The Indian market was flat. Yesterday's forecasts were unremarkable.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading has been busier in recent days, but transactions are small and mostly done between industry players. The factories' buying interest is not very strong. However, due to the rising trend in yarn prices, the cotton market has a solid foundation. Therefore, there is still optimism about the future of the cotton market.

### Piece Goods: Increase in Factory Cloth Prices is Moderate, Stockpiling Remains Strong

The factory cloth market was stable and prices were firm yesterday. Speculative trading remained strong. The increase in selling prices had slowed down. The prices of white cloth, both coarse and fine, and some twills continued to rise by 10 to 25 cents per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth was flat. The sale of inventory from various cloth factories also became more active. However, most of it was speculative stockpiling, processing, bleaching, and dyeing, and waiting for spring sales. The street's trading volume included over 1,000 pieces of undyed cloth, bleached and dyed cloth, and coarse and fine cloth. The Zhejiang and Fujian groups purchased over 200 pieces of filature silk, blue cloth, and fine cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong groups purchased over 300 pieces of bleached cloth, blue cloth, colored twill, coarse cloth, and twill. The Yantai group purchased nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth and woolen cloth. Overseas buyers from places like Little Luzon and Singapore purchased 3,000 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth.

The morning market for eastern cloth rose, but the afternoon market was flat, although the overall trend remained high. The highest price for longtou fine cloth reached 44.25 yuan. Subsequently, due to profit-taking sales from retail investors and a decline in yarn prices at the exchange, market sentiment softened slightly. The closing price was 43.75 yuan, a continuing increase of 20 to 30 cents. The new order price for Sijunzi serge was 1.245 yuan per yard.

On the 15th, 590 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, 45 pieces were shipped to a distant location, and 9 pieces were shipped to Singapore.

### The Future of the Woolen Industry

The future of the woolen industry, under the current system of control and blockade, with limited customer sales and endless price increases, the general purchasing power will inevitably weaken even further. Old goods are being sold off one after another, and new goods are expensive and valuable, making it difficult to do business and generate profits are minimal. On the one hand, expenses are high, and it is difficult to obtain large profits. According to the profits of the woolen industry in 1940, they relied entirely on making money from the old stock. Actual sales were lower than in 1939. Therefore, it is predicted that the profits of the woolen industry in 1941 will inevitably be lower than in 1940. Looking at ordinary woolen shops, the current inventory is all between thirty to fifty thousand, while in previous years, inventory of ten to twenty thousand would have been the same. Showcases with ten to twenty thousand do not feel empty, while thirty to fifty thousand do not feel full. This is not without reason.

### Sugar Market: New Hoarders Buy Coarse White Sugar, Sugar Prices Rebound

Yesterday, the sugar market rebounded due to purchases by new hoarders. The prices therefore returned to climb. The association's assessed prices were: 24 coarse white old stock at 78.6 yuan, new stock at 79.2 yuan, an increase of 7 cents. February 10th orders were 79.6 yuan, 80 yuan, and 80.04 yuan, an increase of 9 cents. Dutch "赤" (chi, a type of sugar) was relatively cheap, with current stock at 65.2 to 65.4 yuan, an increase of 3 cents. Taikoo's granulated white B mark was 79.5 yuan, an increase of 7 cents. DY mark was 77.7 yuan, HX mark was 77.4 to 77.5 yuan, the increase was the same. H mark granulated "赤" (chi) was 61.8 yuan. Local factory No. 1 was 103 yuan, Jingming Yong was 104 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan. # goods opened with "碗靑" (wan qing, a type of sugar) at 62.5 yuan, an increase of 1.5 yuan, and ice flower "靑" (qing), "　糖刁靑" (a type of sugar) opened with 50 bags of Taikoo ship-arrived "刁靑" (diao qing) at 64 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan. Also, 9,400 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Seafood: Sea Cucumber and Qicai Sell Well

Recent reports indicate that Western sea cucumber prices have been rising, and local groups are purchasing frequently, so sales are quite profitable. The current market price has increased by 10 to 20 yuan compared to before. Jinshan top grade "秃" (tu, a type of sea cucumber) sells for 720 yuan, big "秃" (tu) sells for 640 yuan, medium "秃" (tu) sells for 560 yuan, small-medium "秃" (tu) sells for 500 yuan, medium sells for 400 to 350 yuan, and small "秃" (tu) sells for 300 yuan. Plum blossom sea cucumber sells for 340 yuan.

Recently, over 2,000 bags of newly arrived "冲獅毛菜" (a type of Qicai) were purchased by northern groups at a price of 70 to 65.5 yuan, with quick sales. The market inventory is very scarce. "龍牙菜" (Longya Cai, a type of Qicai) also sells for around 70 yuan, and the price is relatively stable.

Recently, the source of raw starch has been scarce. Even one carload of small bags of powder has not arrived. The market situation is therefore tight. Feiqi Qi mark currently sells for 108 yuan, double TA mark sells for 72 yuan, and double T mark sells for 67 yuan. The future market is expected to continue to rise. The valley rice is also of Dutch origin, and both large and small grains sell for 85 yuan.

### Dried Goods: Miscellaneous Longan Not Yet Opened

Due to recent arrivals of a relatively large quantity of Miscellaneous Longan, there are signs of oversupply. However, due to the high freight costs of each batch of goods, the costs have not been reduced, so most sellers are unwilling to sell too cheaply, and the trading companies, aware of the high prices and market risks, are unwilling to buy lightly, resulting in a stalemate.

### Coal: Tongdeli Coal Falls Back

Tongdeli white coal opened at 15 yuan for the new year, and the dark market was also consistently bullish. No. 1 and No. 2 blocks had to sell for 235-236 yuan per ton. Until recently, there were no new trades. Holders of stockpiles began to release large quantities of inventory, and the price fell after the rise, due to price cutting by buyers. Self-transported inventory sold for only 231-232 yuan, similar to old prices. However, retailers who had already listed prices did not change them for the time being.

### Metals: Limited Supply of Large Tinplate

Large tinplate currently circulating on the market is in very short supply. In addition, overseas sources have been cut off, and the market can only be supported by a few companies with inventory. As a result, market sentiment is quite high. However, it has been found that the sales channels for the goods, such as yarn mills using other goods for rollers, and lock factories and machine factories also have weakening channels, with only intermittent foreign merchants buying. Therefore, actual transactions are quite quiet. The market is only inquiring. Yesterday, prices were quoted at around 24 yuan per sheet for No. 24 patterned tinplate, and No. 26 goods sold for around 11 to 12 yuan, it was said.

### Chinese Troops Arrive on the West Bank of Taihu Lake, Attacking Japanese Strongholds, Believed to Soon Penetrate the Outskirts of Shanghai, Chinese Troops in Jiashan Inflict Heavy Casualties on Japanese in Taozhuang

According to reliable sources arriving in Shanghai from the occupied areas, a large number of Chinese regular troops have recently entered the west bank of Taihu Lake from western Zhejiang. These Chinese troops are wearing official uniforms and carrying new weapons and heavy artillery. The vanguard has arrived in the Wuxing area on the west bank of Taihu Lake. As a result, the Japanese troops in the four suburbs of Wuxing have retreated into the city. Chinese troops are conducting sweeps of Japanese troops every day, and ambushes and encounters occur from time to time.

Building Defenses, Attacking Daily

The Chinese troops have also established consolidated bases in the occupied areas of the area, constructing fortifications for positional warfare and new-style trenches in the Lian Town, Hanshan, and Xinshi areas. Artillery positions have also been set up on the mountains. The regular troops are the ×××th Division of the Army. Since arriving in the area, they have been attacking Japanese strongholds every day and cutting off their lines of communication. Internally, they are eliminating bandits. The notorious bandit leader, nicknamed Yehu Junsheng, has been eliminated by the Chinese troops for repeatedly engaging in looting and kidnapping in the area. The bandit was captured and executed.

Japanese Defense Zone in Taihu Lake is Now Smaller

The area occupied by Japanese troops on the west bank of Taihu Lake is gradually shrinking, while the Chinese defense zone is expanding daily. The national flag of the Republic of China is hoisted high in the mountains and towns in the Chinese defense zone, flying in the sky. Local residents also believe that a large number of regular troops are now entering the occupied areas of the eastern theater, and that there is a good chance of launching a large-scale counteroffensive in the spring, and will soon penetrate the outskirts of Shanghai.

Heavy Casualties Among Japanese Troops in Taozhuang

Since the increase in the Chinese troops' defense in western Zhejiang, there have been daily advances. On the 6th of this month, Jiashan County Magistrate ××× led the Self-Defense Brigade to the area north of the county seat. Subsequently, the ×th Regiment of the ××th Division of the Army also arrived, preparing to recover the towns of Xitang and Ganmi, occupied by Japanese troops to the east. Hearing the news, the Japanese troops first used two speedboats on the morning of the 9th, carrying 50 to 60 people, departing from Xitang, landing at Xiadian Temple, and marching northwest. At about 7:00 a.m., they invaded Taozhuang Town to search for Chinese troops. When they reached the northern edge of the town, they were spotted by a Chinese sentry, who immediately charged forward. The Japanese troops retreated into the town, and fierce street fighting ensued. The Japanese troops, unable to resist, retreated to the Jiuhe rice shop in the town and were surrounded by Chinese troops. After waiting patiently, the Japanese troops, seeing no movement, tried to escape, and the Chinese troops struck head-on, killing countless. The survivors fled north to the Fen River and escaped by boat, seeking assistance from all directions. By the time reinforcements arrived, the Chinese troops had retreated to a safe defense zone. According to news from Xitang, the Japanese troops returned in a very embarrassed state, carrying back 26 corpses and many wounded, with six missing. Few were left. The Chinese troops only suffered minor injuries to five people, with no one killed in action. This shows that Chinese military tactics have greatly improved.

The French Concession's Commodity Price Research Committee, in order to curb inflation and stabilize residents' lives, has provided a method to balance commodity prices and regulate the prices of some goods, which will be implemented by the French Consulate in the near future.

Hoarders Sell Off

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) vigorously investigated speculative rice merchants, large and small hoarders have been alarmed. Those who previously relied on hoarding goods and refused to sell their existing stock easily are now gradually selling off, due to the authorities' strict enforcement of the law. Coupled with a bountiful harvest in the producing areas, with grain accumulating like mountains, there is an urgent need to expand outward. As a result, prices have fallen sharply. Over 10,000 bags of foreign rice have been shipped to the port in recent days (4,000 bags shipped from the Dingsheng ship yesterday), and the price lowering measures have continued. Also, the storage in public warehouses is sufficient. Due to these factors, the price of food in the city has been falling daily, and the public's anxiety has eased slightly.

Market Changes

However, according to public opinion, the rice prices assessed by the previous rice assessment committee are no longer applicable to the current situation and need to be reassessed. The assessed selling prices were determined when rumors were rampant in the market, hoarders and speculators were holding on to existing stock, and the authorities were unable to effectively enforce the laws. Now, the actual prices have fallen within the price limits, but market transactions and store sales still use the price limits as the standard, which is not appropriate. Therefore, the rice assessment committee should re-assess the prices based on current purchase prices, plus transportation costs, water transport fees, and reasonable profits, so that the burden on the citizens can be reduced, and social security can be stabilized. This should not be delayed or ignored.

### Regarding the Fang Dan Case, Yesterday's Continued Trial Was Intense; Bo Liang's Arguments Were Met with Much Rebuttal; The Responsibilities and Freedom of the Land Protector

Regarding the case of four Chinese landowners suing the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Consular Court, the trial continued at the same location yesterday. The defendant's lawyer, Bo Liang, stated that the judgment of the First Special District Court could not be regarded as correct because the court was under political pressure from the Chinese authorities. He declared that at the next hearing, he could present proof. The plaintiff's lawyer, Liu Shifang, countered that a judge of one court,

Cannot Criticize

The judgment made by a judge of another court, and that Bo Liang was suspected of insulting the First Special District Court. Bo Liang's insult to the First Special District Court was likely due to his defeat in the Chinese court a year ago when he represented the case. In our opinion, one court should show considerable respect to another, especially since the Chinese courts have always been friendly to this court. Yesterday's debate between the two sides was

Very Intense

And the fourth plaintiff, Zhu Ruiqing, refused to answer lawyer Bo Liang's cross-examination because most of his questions were unreasonable. However, after repeated urging, Zhu finally stated that he was a land protector authorized by the Chinese government and could determine the authenticity of the Fang Dan. Lawyer Bo Liang stated that Zhu had only served as a land protector for one year in 1933. Lawyer Liu Shifang cited several articles of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations to prove his legal points, and pointed out that the Shanghai Municipal Council had abandoned the collection of Fang Dan land taxes for more than 100 years, so whether the Shanghai Municipal Council has the right to collect taxes is now questionable. The plaintiff's use of the Shanghai Municipal Council's public facilities is irrelevant to this case. This matter must be decided after the signing countries' diplomatic representatives agree to amend the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, because the Shanghai Municipal Council's arbitration bodies have no power to change these regulations. Even the Shanghai Municipal Council itself is restricted by the Yangjingbang Land Regulations. It is reported that several things were discovered during yesterday's continued trial: (1) One plaintiff had corresponded with an American lawyer; (2) The Fang Dan that Zhu Ruiqing claimed to have lost has been found; (3) Liu Shifang also presented a book of Chinese legal documents explaining the appointment of land protectors. The correspondence between the plaintiff and the American lawyer also explained the status of the land protector. Bo Liang consistently expressed doubt about the work of the land protector.

### Confiscation of Hong Kong-branded Matches

According to reports, there is a type of Hong Kong-branded match with the words "Donghua" printed inside the box paper. It is not a domestic product and should be strictly guarded against. The authorities have telegraphed their subordinates to investigate and confiscate.

### Charity Groups Hold Banquet for Dr. Baker; Scheduled for the 17th

Dr. Baker, director of the American Red Cross China Relief Department and executive director of the China International Famine Relief Commission, arrived in Shanghai on the President Pierce on the 6th of this month. He will stay here for two weeks and is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong on the American mail ship Taft on the 22nd of this month, en route to Chongqing. More than ten charitable organizations, including the local Refugee Relief Association, have decided that when Mr. Baker returns to the United States, he will travel and appeal for funds, raising 50 million yuan to relieve Chinese disaster victims. He will also personally engage in distribution in Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, and other places. This kind of relief enthusiasm is admirable. A welcome reception will be held at the Red Cotton Restaurant on the day after tomorrow (the 17th). At that time, in addition to expressing gratitude to Mr. Baker, he will be asked to report on his fundraising efforts in the United States and his observations of the people of Free China. There will also be entertainment and other programs.

### Shanghai Passengers Going to Hong Kong Still Temporarily Paying Deposits

After the Hong Kong government implemented the new ordinance on limited-term population entry yesterday (the 14th), major shipping companies in this city, such as Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, and Butterfield & Swire, are still temporarily taking measures to increase the deposit when passengers purchase tickets to Hong Kong. Today, Taikoo's Hai Kou and An Shun vessels, and Butterfield & Swire's Yong Sheng vessel, are still carrying passengers away from Shanghai according to the original deposit increase method.

### Disaster Relief Committee to Continue Distributing Steamed Buns Starting Today; Children Not Given; Preparing Eighty Bags of Flour

The United Charity Disaster Relief Committee has been distributing steamed buns on Ma Bai Road since the 6th of this month. As the number of recipients increased sharply, the distribution was suspended on the 10th. The committee has decided to continue distributing steamed buns starting today. However, in order to maintain order and avoid trouble, children will not be given any, and men and women will be given in separate areas. It is stipulated that Seymour Road, Pinlang Road, and Gordon Road Ma Bai Road are two exits, and Little Shabao Road Ma Bai Road is the entrance, to facilitate evacuation. The Putuo Road police station will send thirteen police officers, along with ten committee staff members and sixty-one coolies, to jointly take care of and suppress the situation. Today's distribution time is still from 2 PM to 4 PM, and no distribution will be made after the time limit. Eighty bags of flour are prepared, making 40,000 steamed buns.

### US-Japan Relations: The Future Is Extremely Pessimistic; The Date of War Between the Two Countries Is Probably Not Far Off; What Mr. Shimazu, Director of the Japan YMCA, Said

The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reported that Mr. Shimazu, director of the Shanghai Japan YMCA, who recently returned to Shanghai after giving a series of lectures in the United States, declared to reporters this morning (the 14th) that most American businessmen expressed pessimism about the current US-Japan relations and predicted that the occurrence of war between the two countries was not far off. However, Mr. Shimazu declared that this could not be said to be American businessmen opposing Japan, because the middle class and workers in the United States, although they predicted the possibility of war between the US and Japan, all supported the war, because the war could promote industrial development and obtain higher wages. Regarding the first-generation Japanese immigrants growing up in the United States, Mr. Shimazu said that when the conscription law was passed, the American people were very suspicious of whether these Japanese immigrants were willing to enlist or evade military service. However, what the American people felt differently was that these second-generation Japanese immigrants growing up in the United States enthusiastically enlisted, so the American people began to feel that these Japanese immigrants had actually become Americans, not "fifth columnists." Mr. Shimazu finally said that when he returned to the Far East, he took the Japanese ship Kamakura. When the ship sailed to San Francisco, he discovered that there were 48 Germans on board, some of whom were Americans of German descent. These Germans told Mr. Shimazu that the reason they left the United States was because they were suspected of any worker sabotage incidents that occurred near their homes.

### Yangtze River Shipping Under the Interruption of Japanese Vessels

Since the Japanese naval police strictly restricted foreign vessels traveling to Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangbei, various foreign merchant ships have encountered even more difficult misfortunes. The Leping and Lima vessels traveling to Jiangbei have been suspended due to huge losses after being detained. In fact, unless Japanese merchant ships transport the local products from the Jiangbei area to Shanghai, foreign ships are at risk of being confiscated if they want to transport them. The goods transported from Shanghai to Jiangbei are also transported by Japanese merchant ships, and foreign ships have no possibility of intervention. Recently, the Japanese side has sent plainclothes police and soldiers to various docks to investigate foreign ships sailing to Shanghai from various places. The Shanghai-Zhejiang shipping is currently on the verge of extinction. There are more than ten ships traveling there idle in Shanghai. In the past, when Japanese warships blockaded the Zhejiang sea, the passage of foreign ships was obstructed, but small sailboats could sometimes still travel. Now, Japanese warships are preventing such ships from traveling and even using machine guns to shoot at them. The German merchant ship Hai Fu, which was detained in Wenzhou for more than two months, was released and returned to Shanghai at the end of last year. For many days, the Japanese side still prohibits the ship from unloading its cargo. The reason is that the ship does not accept the rules of its punishment. However, all the ship is carrying is fruit, and after more than two months of delay, it is feared that it has all rotted.

### The Isolated Army Camp: Industrial Development; Officers and Soldiers Are Hardworking and Dedicated; The Quality of Products Is Excellent

The isolated army camp on Jiaozhou Road has been actively engaged in industrial production in recent years. The products, such as isolated army brand socks, wool socks, soap, wooden ware, and rattan ware, have spread to major groups and institutions throughout Shanghai so far. The products are of excellent quality and are praised by everyone. In fact, comrades in the isolated army were able to provide most of the daily necessities for their own use, such as clothing, hats, socks, soap, towels, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and daily furniture, between the years of twenty-seven and twenty-eight. The current products of the isolated army camp are the several types that they considered the most skilled in the past. Currently, each soldier in the camp works four hours a day, and the workshop is open for eight hours a day, divided into two shifts. The isolated army industry is divided into three groups: (1) The sock weaving group - last year, the number of isolated army soldiers weaving socks was the largest, accounting for one-third of the total number of people in the camp. There are now hundreds of new sock machines, producing dozens of dozens of various sizes of socks every day. Last year's sales were more than 1,500 dozens, and the 32-strand double-thread socks were the most popular. (2) The soap group - the number of people participating in soap work accounts for one-tenth of the total number of people in the camp. The scale is smaller than the sock weaving group, but the output is doubled. Last year, more than 30,000 bars of soap were sold. (3) The rattan ware and wooden ware group - the number of people is smaller. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will adopt isolated army brand products as much as possible out of love for the isolated army industry. The isolated army comrades should strive for excellence in quality to live up to the expectations of the public.

### Cautious Replacement of Night Curfew Permits in the French Concession

Since the French Concession Police Department issued an order to replace the new night curfew permits starting today, it has been learned that the French Police Department is extremely cautious about the receipt of this year's night curfew permits. As of now, only a little more than a hundred new permits have been approved for replacement. The reason is that for the various institutions, groups, commercial firms, and newspaper personnel residing in the French Concession that are established in the Public Concession, the authorities have decided not to temporarily replace the permits they used in the past in the French Concession. They should obtain them from the Public Concession. Those in the French Concession can replace the old permits with new permits, but they must also provide documentary proof that they need a permit due to the inconvenience of traveling at night before they can be approved for replacement.

### The Xin Anli Vessel Returns to Shanghai from Aotou; The Voyage Was Smooth

The British-owned Marler Company's Xin Anli vessel ran aground off the coast of Oujiangkou in Kanmen last November. After being detained by Japanese warships, it was unable to sail. Later, the manager of the local Oriental Shipping Company changed the route to Gualitou and was fortunate to enter the port. Now, the vessel is sailing smoothly and sailed back to Shanghai from Gualitou on the evening of the 3rd. It berthed at the 16th Pier yesterday to unload its cargo. According to the company, it has not yet been decided whether the vessel will continue to sail. Since the Aojiang River was blockaded, this vessel is the first to travel smoothly back and forth along the route.

### Issuance of New Subsidiary Currency Notes; HSBC Bank Exchanges as Much as Possible with Other Banks

After the four banks of the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank obeyed the Ministry of Finance's order to vigorously regulate the subsidiary currency in Shanghai, in addition to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank issuing one-cent and five-cent currency notes, and entrusting the Shanghai Banking Association to issue aluminum subsidiary currency, various friendly banks such as HSBC and Chartered Bank transported a large number of one-yuan notes and ten-cent and twenty-cent subsidiary currency notes from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Now, the Central Bank's new version of the ten-cent and twenty-cent notes has been transported to Shanghai in batches and entrusted to HSBC Bank for issuance. Anyone in the banking industry who has dealings with the bank will be given as much exchange as possible, but exchange is refused to the tobacco exchange industry, fearing that the industry will take the opportunity to profit. The Central Bank can also exchange one-yuan notes. Currently, the one-yuan notes, ten-cent and twenty-cent subsidiary currency notes, one-cent and five-cent currency notes, and aluminum subsidiary currency circulating in Shanghai are sufficient for the circulation in the Shanghai market. Now that it is the period for various industries to handle the closing of accounts, the demand is justified, and the transportation of friendly banks to Shanghai for regulation and assistance in maintaining Shanghai's finances, the lunar New Year, and the change of subsidiary currency, should be more than enough.

### The Labor-Management Dispute of the Four Car Companies Was Fully Resolved Yesterday; Labor and Management Made Concessions to Each Other and Discussed Openly; Wages, Allowances, and Annual Bonuses Were All Increased

The labor-management dispute of the four major automobile companies in this city, Yunfei, Xiangsheng, Tailai, and Silver, eased after the mediation of Gu Bingyuan of the Industrial Division of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Labor and management representatives held negotiations at 3 PM the day before yesterday. At that time, due to the limited time, it was not resolved, so the unfinished negotiations were continued at 3 PM yesterday. Both sides discussed openly and made concessions to each other, ending at 6 PM. The entire incident was finally completely resolved. The important terms accepted by the capital side were: (1) Daily wage increase of two cents; (2) Increase in living allowance of 75%, totaling 75 yuan; (3) Two-month annual bonus. The labor side expressed satisfaction with these conditions. The details of other related duties were also compromised through negotiations.

### The Women and Children's Relief Association Will Hold a Charity Tea Dance; Date - February 9; Location - Lido Ballroom

The fundraising campaign to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the China Women and Children's Relief Association plans to raise 200,000 yuan for the reconstruction of the Jiangwan Institute. A radio fundraising campaign was held on New Year's Day, which was enthusiastically supported by all parties, but it is still far from the target. Therefore, preparations continue to be made to hold the All-Shanghai Dance Star Charity Tea Dance. At 3 PM yesterday afternoon, the first plenary committee meeting was held. More than 50 people in charge of various dance halls attended. After the presidium Wen Lanting, Xu Qianlin, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, etc. made speeches, the following was discussed and resolved: (1) The All-Shanghai Dance Star Charity Tea Dance will be held on February 9 from 3 PM to 8 PM at the Lido Ballroom. (2) The general outline of the organization of the conference was approved.

Finally, various dance halls subscribed for dance tickets, which was very enthusiastic.

### Only Part of Barbers Are on Strike

Some barbershops in this city went on strike the day before yesterday because their request to improve their treatment was not met by the shop owners. It is reported that the reason for the strike is that before the war, the daily business income was split between labor and management at a ratio of 40/60, with the shop owners accounting for 60% and the barbers accounting for 40%. After the war, due to the sluggish business, it was changed to a 30/70 split, which has lasted for several years. Now, because of the high cost of everything and the difficulty of living, the barbers requested the shop owners to restore the past 40/60 split rule, but it was not met, resulting in a strike. It is learned that barbershops in the Nichengqiao and Jing'an Temple Road areas are still operating as usual and have not been involved in the vortex.

### Internal Reorganization of the Refugee Relief Association Completed; Relief Policy Remains Unchanged

The Refugee Relief Association has recently reduced its income from various donations and is experiencing financial difficulties. The board of directors decided at a recent meeting to reduce the number of internal staff to save money. The reorganization was completed the day before yesterday (the 11th). According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the number of staff members laid off was more than 20, and each was given four months of severance pay. The number of staff members retained is now 31, who are responsible for the various parts of the association's affairs. After this reorganization, the association's relief policy for refugees in this city has not changed. It is also learned that the total number of refugees currently housed in various shelters in this city is about 14,000, and the association distributes food and supplies to them on a regular basis. However, the required expenses are still huge, and the regular donation income is not enough to maintain them. It is hoped that all sectors of society will provide assistance.

### Gambling Dens Continue to Be Cracked Down on in the Public Concession; A Portuguese Resident Was Arrested in an Apartment on Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road; The Mastermind Escaped

According to the Dazhong News Agency, the scourge of gambling in the western district has recently spread to the concession. There are currently at least five gambling dens in the Public Concession, one of which is located at 7 Difeng Road, and the person in charge is a Russian. Another newly opened gambling den is located on the 17th floor of the Broadway Mansion, which is where the Swiss fugitive Huierte previously resided. The fugitive currently resides at 52 Daxilu. It is said that he is the owner of the new gambling den. It is said that there is also a gambling den in the Silver Palace Ballroom at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Weihaiwei Road. There were originally two gambling dens in the ballroom, one of which has been cracked down on and closed by the police. The Overseas Chinese Federation opposite the Difeng Road Fire Station is a newly opened one, and it is said that it is managed by a Spanish and two Russians. In addition, it is said that there is also a gambling den at 204 Seymour Road, above the Watson's drug factory. The Public Concession Police Department is taking swift and vigorous action against secret gambling dens opened in the concession and is conducting a large-scale search. On Saturday (the 11th) evening, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department cracked down on a gambling den in Room 35A, Dennis Apartment, Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road. At that time, a Portuguese resident, Rui Weixian, was arrested. It is said that this person is only a "front man." The real owners of the gambling den are two Spanish residents, who had already escaped after hearing the news beforehand. Yesterday, the Western Investigation Unit of the Police Department was conducting a strict investigation into this matter. As for the case of Pan Boxiu, the owner of the "37427" General Association, who was cracked down on at 147 Jing'an Temple Road the day before yesterday, the Portuguese Consulate held a preliminary hearing on Monday (the 13th). At that time, only the testimony of the Police Department was heard, and Pan Boxiu was not summoned to court for questioning. It is not yet certain when the second hearing will be held. It is generally expected that Pan Boxiu may be found guilty.

### A Grenade Was Thrown at the Yongyao Hat Shop, Shattering One Side of the Large Glass

At about 6:10 PM last night, someone suddenly threw a hand grenade, shaped like a tin can, into the Yongyao Hat Shop at 596 Sichuan Road, shattering one side of the large glass with a loud bang and damaging many hats. Fortunately, no one was injured. The grenade thrower then fled into the crowd without a trace.

According to the shopkeeper, there were no threatening letters beforehand, and a hand grenade was thrown. It is unknown why. The police station is currently investigating.

### Feces Boats Oppose Price Increase

The feces boat industry in the Public Concession area is dedicated to transporting feces to Suzhou and Wuxi for sale. Since the Ditali Company Cleaning Bureau took over the business, it has recently increased the price of feces from 33 cents to 40 cents. The entire industry has expressed opposition and is currently brewing a strike to achieve the reversal of the order.

### Destitute Refugees in Nanshi Move to Xietu Road

According to the Shewen News Agency, since Father Rao left Shanghai and the refugee district in Nanshi was dissolved in disguise, all 80-odd refugee shelters have also been dissolved. The refugees have also been making a living on their own. There are still more than 2,000 old and weak refugees returning to Nanshi, all of whom are homeless and destitute. It is heard that the refugees were moved to the Xietu Road Poor People's Village by the Nanshi "District Public Office" a few days ago.

### Impersonating and Extorting Was Arrested; Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months

Wu Fuyu, a Wuxi merchant, came to Shanghai from his hometown on the 6th of this month at 5:15 PM, carrying 11,000 yuan in legal tender. He exchanged more than 10,000 yuan in military tickets at the Fugang Money Exchange at 124 Peng Road and hid the money on his body for travel expenses and other expenses. While walking near Alley 119, Miller Road, a young Ningbo man, Wang Xinfu, suddenly stepped forward, dragged him into the alley, and said that his exchange of legal tender for military tickets was a violation of the regulations of the Japanese consulate to give a certificate. He said that he was an inspector of the consulate. In a state of anxiety, Wu offered 50 yuan to avoid trouble. Wang Xinfu was furious and said that the small amount could not solve the problem, so he slapped him twice in the face, put a hand into his pocket, pretended to grope for a pistol, and said it was beautiful, otherwise his life would be in danger. Wu had to hand over 1,000 yuan in legal tender in full. After Wang Xinfu obtained the money, he swaggered away in the direction of Peng Road. Wu Fuyu then reported to the nearby Chinese police officer on duty at post 1374, who helped him chase after him and caught him. He was brought together with the stolen money to the Hongkou Police Station and sent to the First Special Court for trial and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial. Chiang Bao-lien, the police station lawyer, stated that the date should be changed. No other cases were found. He asked for investigation. As a result, Wang Xinfu was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment as a warning.

### Suicide and Notes

Li Jiasheng, a local man, 28 years old, lived at 26 Gua Street, Fushi Lane, and made a living selling medicinal materials. Recently, due to business failure, he was heavily in debt, and with the end of the year approaching, he had no means of making money, so he had the idea of dying.

Li Zhu, a woman in her thirties, lived at 4 Hengqing Lane, Wujiaochang, Caogdu, Huxi. Her husband recently returned from doing business abroad and discovered that his wife had lost a lot of money due to gambling and had pawned all her clothes and jewelry. He scolded her greatly. Unexpectedly, she felt ashamed to face others and swallowed poison at about 1 AM yesterday to commit suicide. Fortunately, her husband discovered it and hired a car to take her to the hospital for treatment. It is said that her life is not in danger.

At about 11 AM the day before yesterday, a French man of unknown name swallowed a bottle of poison in front of the Second Special Court on Xue Huali Road, French Concession.

The police officer on duty reported to the police station and urgently summoned an ambulance to take him to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the poisoning was very deep and his life was in danger.

Zhang Jinsheng, a carpenter from Chongming, 20 years old, recently felt economic pressure and could not maintain his life, so he had a short-sighted idea. At 8 PM the day before yesterday, he went to the Account Shop of the Minle Inn at 44 Xiahua Road. He took poison that night and committed suicide. The waiter discovered it, reported it to the police station, and sent him to the hospital. He died despite treatment. The body was sent to the morgue.

### Ticket Seller Eager to Ring the Bell to Start the Car; A Girl Fell and Was Crushed to Death; British-owned Route 17 Trolleybus Caused the Accident

Xu Yuzhen, a girl from Changzhou who lived at 625 Malang Road, was 19 years old and worked as a female worker in Shanghai. On the afternoon of December 26 last year, she and her cousin Xu Xingda took a British-owned Route 17 trolleybus from Dapuqiao, French Concession, to get off at the intersection of Kanti Road and Caishi Road. Because the third-class ticket seller Chen Bingxiang, No. 476, rang the bell to start the car without waiting for Ms. Xu to get off, Ms. Xu jumped off when the trolleybus was moving, lost her balance, and fell to the ground. Her left foot was crushed by the wheel. The police arrived and sent her to Guangci Hospital. The treatment was ineffective, and she died the day before yesterday. The police station carried the body to the morgue. Because the deceased's parents were still in the countryside, her relatives took care of the funeral yesterday. After her relatives arrived in Shanghai, they negotiated with the trolleybus company and demanded compensation for the damage, and then took the coffin back to their hometown for burial.

After a big meal and plenty of wine, bringing home the scent of women's powder.

Suddenly, two "heroes" jumped out from the darkness, pressing something hard against my waist: "Friend! Help a little!"

And so, left with only a shirt, shivering in the northwest wind; this was the first time I tasted "cold," so it was!

But: "Why do you have to ask me to help?"

Naturally, someone will tell you:

The roads are full of starving people begging for money, "If you don't give it," then they really have to eat and wear the northwest wind? Everyone wants to live, if you don't "help" them, they will take risks! The saying "Only when people are fed and clothed will they know honor and shame" is "exactly what this means."

So: if you can "help a little" in the first place, there won't be forced "helping a little"; if you refuse to "help a little" in the first place, then of course there will only be forced "helping a little"!

"Is it really that simple?"

Yes, it's actually very simple.

### A World Apart

— Fang Heng

It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon, the early winter sun warm on my skin, the sky high and clear. I decided to take advantage of the good weather to visit my maternal aunt and uncle and cousins who lived beyond the Settlement boundary.

Because he couldn't afford the high cost of housing in the "Orphan Island," my uncle had moved to the countryside near the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway two months ago. Although the rent was reduced by as much as eight-tenths, the rice at over ninety dollars per dan, as well as the vegetables and daily necessities that were invariably expensive, could not be avoided. His meager income was still not enough to cover the expenses of a family of four, and the high cost of living was really suffocating the old man.

In the two months since I had last seen them, my aunt and uncle had aged a lot, especially my aunt, whom I almost didn't recognize. Formerly plump, I could now see the outlines of her bones. Her cheeks were sunken, her eyes looked large, and her speech was soft and lifeless. Yet she continued to toil all day long, without a moment's rest. My uncle's hair was also turning white. His eyes were covered with red streaks, dim and lifeless, a clear sign of excessive worry. Alas! Worry is simply an invisible knife, constantly chopping at people's hearts, without a sound, without a drop of blood, and how many people are harmed by it! Like my uncle's family, how many millions of families are struggling under the threat of life?!

My younger cousin was still lively and lovable, but my older cousin had become silent and taciturn. Her figure seemed much fuller and taller than when I saw her two months ago. Now she had dropped out of school and was helping her mother with housework, using her spare time to study on her own.

My younger cousin hopped and skipped, pulling me to play. Having lived in the city for nearly three years, I found everything in the countryside fresh and interesting: a patch of open ground next to the house for drying clothes and vegetables, a well in the left corner with the surface of the water reflecting the clear blue sky like a round mirror, and a vegetable garden beyond a fence along the well. Standing in front of the fence, I thought deeply, thinking of my lovely hometown: when will I be able to throw myself into her embrace and breathe free air?

The sun was gradually setting in the west, red like the face of a drunkard, and the wind blew with a few chills. I had to leave. My aunt had diligently cooked rice porridge, and the side dishes were a plate of lotus root and a plate of white sugar, placed in the center of the table.

"This kind of broken rice lacks nutrients, it's better to cook it with red beans," my uncle said, explaining to me as he picked up his bowl of porridge. He pointed to the two plates in the center of the table with his chopsticks: "This is the most economical way. Can you get used to it?"

"I can get used to it, Uncle," I replied. "I think it's very delicious!"

This was not just a polite remark. I really felt comfortable and at ease eating it, because I knew that even if I were eating delicacies or bear paws and monkey brains, and the groans of others starving were ringing in my ears, wouldn't that be as tasteless as chewing mud?

After finishing the porridge, the sky gradually darkened, and all the outlines on the earth became blurred. I said goodbye. My uncle wanted to walk me part of the way, but I declined, but the old man insisted on going. In the twilight, the two of us walked silently across the plank bridge, across the rice paddies, and across the graveyard, finally walking onto the road near the ×× Garden, before he trudged back alone along the same route. I turned around and looked at his lonely back, and sighed softly, without a sound.

Returning to my residence, I saw the electric lights in the living room burning brightly. I walked past the window and peeked inside: Miss Four and her boyfriend were squeezed on the sofa, eating and talking. On the small table in front of them was a large glass plate, filled with things like duck wings and duck tongues. Next to the vase on the round table was a white paper box with a row of red foreign words, "Western Desserts from ××."

Suddenly, the telephone rang loudly. I went over and picked it up. It turned out that Auntie had come to invite the family here to dinner at "×× Restaurant."

### Three-Step Song

— Shuying

British-owned public buses once again "requested" a fare increase from the authorities, which has been "approved" and will be "implemented" starting on the 26th...

Request, approve, implement—this seems to be a three-step song.

Three-step song—nothing could be clearer to everyone!

So you "request," he "requests," everyone "requests" together; then you "approve," he "approves," everyone "approves" together; then why not "implement" immediately? No wonder the "rising wind" is as fashionable as lightning!

However, with the former three-step song, there is the latter three-step song. What is the latter three-step song? It is:

Freeze! Starve! Die!

That's terrible? That's terrible!

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

As soon as the bald-headed, red-nosed Teacher Song stepped in, a particularly tall figure immediately appeared before Yuqin. He felt that his heart was about to jump out of his chest.

The so-called Division Commander Yuan was indeed that big fat man! A pair of eyes more terrifying than poisonous snakes were circling over the faces of the young people, causing Yuqin to lower his head in a flurry. Ever since he heard the animalistic roar of this big fat man one night, he had always worried about being swallowed by him; now, he felt that this gaping maw of blood had already opened in front of him, and he dared not raise his head to look at him.

He vaguely passed about ten minutes, as if he heard the teacher say a few words. It also sounded like that Division Commander Yuan laughed like an owl, and later he heard a burst of heavy leather boots moving.

"I hope he doesn't see me." He kept praying silently.

But how could that work? Division Commander Yuan's gaze was so sharp, and his lowered head was particularly conspicuous, so before Division Commander Yuan had finished handing out the leather caps to the first row of students, he had already seen the person he was thinking about.

"This guy has no good intentions!" Division Commander Yuan's eyes were fixed on Yuqin, while Yuhua's gaze was also fixed on him.

The tall figure finally moved in front of Yuqin, and a hand as fat as a cactus grabbed Yuqin's right hand, which was already as cold as ice, like lightning.

"Good boy, are you Wu Yuqin?"

There was no reply, his head still lowered.

"You sing really well, when will you graduate?"

Still no reply, his body began to tremble.

"This child is just afraid of seeing people!" The teacher was also worried and busy explaining from the side.

Unfortunately, Division Commander Yuan was ultimately a military man. He thought, what was the point of spending hundreds of dollars to send this generous gift? At the same time, he did not feel that a high-ranking official had any need to talk to a singing child about propriety or politeness. After hesitating for only a few seconds, he could not help but reach out his hand, lift Yuqin's chin, and forcibly raise his already ashen face.

"This child is really too shy!" (9)

### Guan’s Philosophy of Life (8)

In order to struggle, one must have a cool head. To have a cool head, one must first have a calm mind, a focused spirit, and emotions that are not flustered; second, one must forget everything, not putting any consideration of benefits, losses, success, or failure in one's heart; third, one must rely on experience, as one who has seen the sea finds it difficult to be impressed by other waters. Learning the experience of struggling from adversity is the most effective method.

### Can’t Afford It Anymore!

— Ma Ge

### "Minding Other People's Business"

— Qian Fei

The Chinese have two old sayings: "Each person sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, and doesn't worry about the frost on another's roof." And: "Zhang's family is long, Li's family is short, I don't care about other people's business." It is said that this "spirit" of "not minding other people's business" is also a kind of "virtue," and can "protect oneself wisely."

The day before yesterday, at the Post Office in Wujiaochang on Baolinnan Road, a Russian woman was robbed. An English expatriate, Radem, saw it, and without regard for his own safety, stepped forward to knock down the bandit. Just as he was about to deal with the other bandits, he was shot dead by another bandit. Even in his critical state, Radem kept shouting, "Report to the police." This spirit of "acting righteously and courageously" is worthy of our admiration! Mr. Radem gave his life for others and died content, but what is regrettable is that all the bystanders at the time were as dumb as wooden chickens. If there had been a second Mr. Radem at the time, coming out to deal with the remaining bandits, not only could Mr. Radem's life have been saved, but it might even have been possible to catch all the bandits in one fell swoop. At the very least, they would not all have been allowed to escape. It is a pity that although there were people nearby at the time, they were all the kind who "don't mind other people's business."

In dealing with people and the world, the most feared thing is "difficulty in maintaining independence." Mutual assistance is the basis of success, and if you want others to help you, you must first help others. We uphold the principle of hating evil as if it were an enemy. I hope that everyone will learn from the spirit of Mr. Radem, and may as well "mind other people's business," and no longer stand idly by, harming themselves and others.

### Crying for Xiling

— Jiang Qi

I never thought that you, Xiling, would leave the world so quietly! Xiling, I wanted to kiss your kind and amiable face again, that benevolent and innocent smile, those sincere and honest eyes, that gentle and resolute demeanor, but I can no longer do it, never again!

Xiling, you cannot die! I know you also died unwillingly! Late at night in Chongqing, the air raid siren sounded, and you were the first to wake us up. Hiding in the air raid shelter in the mountains, you said that none of us could die, that there were still many, many jobs waiting for us. But now, Xiling, you have let go like this and bid us farewell forever! Damnable disease, why didn't you cling to those shameless people, and why did you have to be so heartless, taking away one of our most hard-working comrades, one of our most loyal friends?

In Shanghai, when I encountered misfortune once, you made a special trip from afar to comfort me. When there was a lack of manuscript, you specially got up in the middle of the night to rush the manuscript for me; in Hankou, when there were difficulties, you always helped me and encouraged me tirelessly; in Chongqing, when the weather suddenly turned cold, you took off the woolen shirt on your body and insisted on lending it to me; on the rugged mountain road to the air raid shelter, you constantly looked back, wanting to help me; in the evening, after the big bombing, you made several phone calls in a hurry to find out if I was safe. Oh, Xiling, you are kind, you are sincere, you are straightforward, you are enthusiastic, you are chivalrous, you are loyal" I will never forget that in this life!

You are loyal to your beliefs. For more than ten years, you have endured many hardships and tribulations for your beliefs, but you have never wavered; you work hard, and for more than ten years, you have suffered many insults and curses for your work, but you have never interrupted it. You are generous and never quarrel; you are calm and never cause trouble. Some people say you are weak, but you have never surrendered; some people say you are stupid, but you have never been deceived. For your beliefs, for your work, you only know how to silently, enduring hardship, fight on.

Xiling, you cannot die! We need you, we need to learn from you, to learn from your fighting spirit, to learn from your way of life!

Xiling, you cannot die, we cannot let you die so unwillingly, many, many jobs are waiting for you, and millions of partners need you! Xiling, resurrect, resurrect, open your eyes to see the victorious China, so that I can kiss your kind and amiable face again, that benevolent and innocent smile, those sincere and honest eyes, and that gentle and resolute demeanor!

Xiling, resurrect, resurrect, the China of resistance and construction needs you, and the oppressed masses of the whole world need you!

### Willow in the Brothel

— Gu Mingdao

Halfway through the wine, Huang Yuqi struck the wine cup with his chopsticks, and sang generously: "Holding Wu Ge and wearing rhinoceros armor, the wheels are entangled and the short soldiers meet, the banners cover the sun and the enemy is like clouds, and the arrows fall like rain and the soldiers contend for glory." Liu Rushi was touched by Huang Yuqi's singing of national mourning, and she also turned her face away and sang a verse of Yue Wumu's Manjianghong. When she sang the line "I will eat the flesh of the Huns when I am hungry, and I will drink the blood of the Xiongnu when I am thirsty," there was a sense of desolation mixed with heroism, and Huang Yuqi struck the table in praise. After the song was finished, Shi Da went over and took a precious sword and started dancing in front of the banquet. The light of the sword flickered, like a dragon soaring. After the dance, Huang Yuqi ordered the army to play the music of the expedition, the Hu jia mourned sadly, and the drums roared, making people feel heroic. After a while, the wine was over and the banquet was over, and Liu Rushi asked about the teacher's schedule again. Yuqi said: "It is expected to reach Jiangyin within half a month, take Zhenjiang directly and peek at Jinling. At that time, I will also ask Madam Liu to urge Shangshu Qian to come out and support us. The righteous army will be very fortunate." Liu Rushi agreed. After saying goodbye to Yuqi, she went back to rest. She couldn't sleep at night, and the moon was in the sky, so she got up to look at the sea view, and sang a few poems again. The next day, Shi Da still sent her back to Yushan. The army was even more excited after receiving Madam Liu's reward, and Shi Da immediately acted as the vanguard after returning. The large fleet passed Chongming Island and sailed towards the mouth of the Yangtze River. For a time, the momentum was also very strong, and Rushi was also looking forward to the early arrival of the righteous army in Yushan day and night. But unfortunately, when Huang Yuqi's righteous army was at the mouth of the Yangtze River, the weather suddenly changed drastically, and a very large hurricane suddenly rose at sea. The turbid waves filled the sky, the sun and stars were hidden, and Huang Yuqi's warships were blown to pieces, drifting east and west, and seven or eight out of ten capsized in the waves. Huang Yuqi's big ship had its mast broken by the wind and also sank into the sea. Fortunately, Shi Da's ship did not capsize and rescued Huang Yuqi, who did not join the wave ministers. They escaped to the beach, in a very embarrassed state. Suffering this unfortunate blow, Huang Yuqi's many years of hard work were all in vain. The righteous army died, scattered, and turned into nothing. (35)

### Sayings on Self-Cultivation (12)

One mouths that life is difficult, but one's own expenses are unrestrained, spending all the money in hand at one go. Once the money is used up, one racked one's brains to come up with all kinds of ways to make money, regardless of conscience, morality, or personality. When a person falls to this point, if they do not wake up early, one day they will be eliminated by society.

### Xiling is Not Weak

— Xiao Luo

With the death of Xiling, in terms of private friendship, we have lost a very good friend, and in the art world, especially in the film world and on the stage, we have lost a vigorous and promising young warrior. I was a classmate of Xiling several times, and also a colleague several times. I am more familiar with everything about him. In my memory, Xiling was very weak from childhood, not only physically, but also in his way of life. In dealing with family affairs or with friends, he always let others have their way, and he didn't want to argue with others with veins bulging. In his opinion, they were all meaningless.

Such a person is weak and not worthy of emulation, but Xiling's weakness is limited to some personal relationships. He is loyal to art, and in art, he is brave and stubborn. Let me cite two old stories:

He went to Japan with the intention of studying painting, so he entered the Tokyo Art School in Ueno, but at that time, the scope of Zhejiang's government-funded students did not include art schools. Xiling had no choice but to enter the Kyoto Higher Technical School to study dyeing and weaving patterns, in order to obtain government funding, but he spent most of his time on painting and calligraphy on weekdays, and even more so in practicing in the theaters of Tsukiji, Tokyo during the spring and summer holidays.

His first film as a director was "The Cry of Women." At first, at Tianyi, he had to stop halfway because he could not cooperate. Later, Star invited him to remake this film. After it was made, the new materials and new style deeply impressed people. Naturally, directing a film for the first time, a lack of skill is inevitable, but he received a lot of cold ridicule for it. At that time, Xiling said to me several times: "I want to find a way to get 10,000 yuan to buy the film back and avoid being embarrassed." The result was naturally not achieved. He did not reply to those satires, but buried himself in hard work, determined to reply with his works. It was not until the release of "Crossroads" and other films that Xiling breathed a sigh of relief.

In short, Xiling seems to be sloppy at all times and in all places, but friends who have interacted with him know that Xiling is brave and loyal in art. People engaged in art should learn this from Xiling.
