### US Establishes Diplomatic Policy: World Situation to See Development; Dr. Currie's Report Favorable to China; List of Needed Items Taken Back to Washington

Washington: Far East experts stated yesterday that President Roosevelt's speech on Saturday evening had shed "dawn" on the process of aiding China. Experts indicated that most of Dr. Currie's report was favorable to China. Previously, some believed that Dr. Currie would submit a report unfavorable to China before returning here because the government had only recently solemnly declared its intention to aid China. Diplomatic circles once speculated that the disputes between Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist Party would hinder American aid to China because the United States was deeply concerned that Chairman Chiang might sever relations with the Soviet Union as a result, creating a difficult diplomatic situation. Since President Roosevelt adopted a sweeping attitude to support the National Government under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and declared ("The United States has told China that it will receive our assistance"), the aforementioned unfavorable news about China has become unfounded. However, the government has not yet indicated how it will aid China. To date, the United States' attention has been focused on Britain and Greece. However, well-informed circles believe that Dr. Currie has taken a list detailing the items China needs. Well-informed circles also stated that China's position is absolutely different from that of Britain. In a few months, the situation in Britain may take a sharp turn for the worse, while China has long been accustomed to Japan's acute pressure and has no fear of it. In fact, most experts even believe that China has now launched an offensive. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

Chongqing: President Roosevelt's broadcast speech yesterday was warmly welcomed here. Great interest was expressed in the section concerning China. It was said that this was a new encouragement for China's war effort and that various rumors spread by foreign countries about the so-called New Fourth Army incident had been dispelled. Either the New Fourth Army has been definitively disbanded, or the international situation is better for China than before. The victory of the Chinese Air Force in the air battles over Chengdu and Wanxian on the 14th of this month can be taken as evidence of material assistance from friendly nations. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

Washington: After President Roosevelt delivered a speech declaring that the United States would fully aid China, Britain, and Greece until ultimate victory was achieved, many believed this was one of the most important speeches Roosevelt had made since taking office and would become one of the most important documents in American history. Last night, Roosevelt hosted a banquet at the White House for members of the Press Correspondents Association and over a hundred important government officials. This banquet is held annually, and this year was Roosevelt's eighth. However, this year was the first time Roosevelt delivered such an important speech. The speech was broadcast to the world in twelve languages afterwards. Roosevelt's remarks about China's war effort demonstrated his concern and sympathy for China. When he spoke, his tone was very low, sometimes rising and falling, to emphasize his meaning. He pronounced the three characters of Chiang Kai-shek separately, somewhat like the Chinese pronunciation. When he finished the section on China, the entire hall erupted in applause. (Dispatch of the 16th)

New York: Capitals around the world, including Washington, believe that the world situation will see new developments due to Roosevelt's enthusiastic speech on aiding democratic nations. This phenomenon was very obvious yesterday. Washington officials believe that this speech is an irreversible admission of the United States' intention to defeat the Axis powers. Members of the U.S. Cabinet predict that U.S. military supplies to Britain will greatly increase. They feel that President Roosevelt has virtually guaranteed Britain's victory. Cabinet members also believe that new developments are imminent.

Reactions from All Sides

Washington's reaction to President Roosevelt's speech was initially seen as a call for unity to support subsequent U.S. policy. Their focus was on the broad scope of the speech, which aroused general interest. Diplomats and observers believe that this was the boldest speech made by an American head of state since the World War. President Roosevelt invited the residents of all occupied countries to rise up in resistance and promised that the United States would increase its aid. He offered assurances to the National Government of China under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and allowed aid to all other nations willing to resist the totalitarian powers. All of this made diplomats and government officials feel that the President had essentially established American foreign policy. Many believe that since the President delivered the speech, American foreign policy has become an indirect challenge to the Axis powers. The United States' challenge is expressed by guaranteeing full aid to China, Britain, Greece, and other countries resisting the Axis powers. London's reaction to the speech was very pleased. The British Broadcasting Corporation expressed the gratitude of the British people. The company stated that with Britain under Churchill's leadership and the United States under Roosevelt's leadership, the democratic front of both countries will stand firm. Berlin avoided immediate criticism. Reliable Roman sources stated that the speech made Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yōsuke's visit to Germany and Italy even more important. This concerns the Axis powers' stance towards the United States and is also related to the Axis' spring offensive. One Italian source believed that this speech was in fact a strong call to war, but the Axis powers would not have any strong reaction. Well-informed circles in Istanbul stated that the democratic nations have seized the initiative in the spring campaign. They also stated that as for Matsuoka Yōsuke's journey, Japan hopes that Hitler will help Japan induce the Soviet Union to sign a non-aggression treaty with Japan, so that Japan can eliminate its worries and deal with the United States. News from the capital of Yugoslavia said that political figures there firmly believe that in a few weeks or months, the United States will become a belligerent. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

### US Intensifies Efforts to Obtain Defense Raw Materials

Washington: Reliable sources stated that defense officials have submitted a list to the U.S. Naval Committee, listing 60 important raw materials and items to be obtained from South America, the Far East, and other places. These raw materials and items are all deemed by the U.S. Army and Navy to be necessary for defense production and are what the United States wants to obtain to prepare for stockpiling. Among them are rubber, mica, nickel, quartz crystals, etc. Well-informed sources stated that the government is currently engaged in a large-scale reorganization of shipping routes, and the aforementioned order is only part of this process. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

### Rumor Says Matsuoka Carries Peace Plan on Trip to Europe, Requests Pope's Aid to Mediate the Entire European War

Manchouli: Foreign Minister Matsuoka and his party arrived here this morning by train from Harbin. They stayed in a hotel and did not go out. They then took a train to Moscow. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

London: Certain diplomatic circles here said today that they have received news that Foreign Minister Matsuoka will lobby Germany and Italy to negotiate peace with Britain and end the European war before the U.S. lend-lease program advances. It is speculated that Japan is quite pleased with its success in mediating the Thai-Vietnamese conflict and therefore wants to try its hand again at mediating the European war. The motive for this may be partly due to the expectation that U.S. aid to China will decrease after the European war ends. (International News Service dispatch, 17th)

Algiers: French officials here said this morning that Foreign Minister Matsuoka has a broad peace plan to take to Berlin to mediate the entire European war. It is rumored that Matsuoka will strongly request Pope Pius XII's support. It is also said that Matsuoka will also ask Britain and France to cooperate to achieve its success. (International dispatch, 17th)

Tokyo: The Aikoku Shimbun reported yesterday that only Japan's participation in the war can stop the U.S. aid to China. Therefore, Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Berlin and Rome is of greater significance. The newspaper stated that Japan feels that Britain will win due to continuous U.S. aid. Therefore, it immediately sent Matsuoka to Europe and knows that Italy may not be able to provide Japan with assistance in the Far East. Therefore, at the very least, it must have Germany help it conclude a non-aggression treaty with Russia. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

### Japanese Newspaper Actually Advocates Bombing Burma

Tokyo: The Hochi Shimbun published an opinion today urging the Japanese military to bomb the Chinese military agencies that have moved from Chinese territory to Burma. It stated that the Langwen (transliteration) aircraft factory, formerly in Yunnan Province, has now moved to Burma. In addition, the Chinese government has established other assembly factories there. American-made aircraft are assembled there and flown to China by Chinese pilots. We should not tolerate this any longer and can only recognize that Burma is now participating in the war effort. The newspaper also stated that although China and Japan have not declared war, the world has "recognized" the existence of a state of war between the two countries. Such obvious wartime activity is beyond the scope of peaceful trade and should be met with self-defense military measures. Japan has shown great patience. The newspaper also said that the consequences of this bombing should be determined by Britain and the United States themselves. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### US Builds New Cruisers, Japan Pays Close Attention

Tokyo: The Japanese are closely watching the U.S. Navy's massive program of expansion and are paying close attention to the U.S. announcement that it is currently building six powerful battlecruisers. These six ships are clearly intended for long-range operations. There are rumors that Britain will exchange three George V-class battleships for several U.S. light cruisers, which the Japanese are also watching closely. (Special dispatch from the North China Daily News, 16th)

### Nishio Returns to Tokyo from North China

Tokyo: General Nishio, the outgoing commander of the Japanese army stationed in China, has returned from North China and arrived at Tokyo Station this morning, where he was warmly welcomed. Later, Nishio met with the Japanese Emperor to report on the development of the war situation in China over the past eight months. Minister of the Army Tojo and Chief of the General Staff Sugiyama also accompanied him. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Japan to Implement Rationing of Grain by Head Count

Tokyo: Official Japanese sources say that from April 1, rice in the Tokyo metropolitan area will be rationed per capita. This will be the first implementation since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Japanese-Dutch Negotiations to Conclude Soon

Batavia: Unofficial but reliable sources recently stated that the Japanese-Dutch trade negotiations are nearing completion. The chief Japanese representative, Yoshizawa, and the Dutch representative, Van Mook, have already discussed the progress of affairs. The negotiations will be completed in at most a few days. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

### Six US Warships Visit New Zealand, Stay for Three Days Before Returning to Pearl Harbor; This Trip Relates to the Situation in the Far East

Washington: The Navy Department announced yesterday that six ships of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, namely the new light cruisers USS Brooklyn and USS Savannah, and the destroyers USS Case, USS Shaw, USS Cassin Young, and USS Talbot, will visit Auckland, New Zealand, for three days before returning to their original defense at Pearl Harbor. The nature of this trip is a goodwill and recreational visit. The four destroyers on this trip all belong to Destroyer Division Six, and Captain Bardock is on the flagship USS Case. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

Wellington: New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser announced that two U.S. cruisers and four destroyers will arrive in Auckland today and depart on Thursday. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Washington: After the Navy Department announced the dispatch of ships to Auckland for an informal visit, many officials secretly admitted that this trip is related to the situation in the Far East. (International News Service dispatch, 17th)

Washington: The U.S. fleet's visit to Auckland not only demonstrates the unity of the United States and the British Empire but also aims to support the morale of the Chinese people. This move can show Japan that U.S. warships can patrol far from their base in Honolulu. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

### Governor of Vietnam Decides to Send Six-Member Technical Delegation to Japan

Tokyo: Sources from Hanoi relayed by Japan say that the Governor-General of Vietnam, Decoux, has decided to send a six-member technical committee to Tokyo to draft the Thai-Vietnamese peace treaty. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Bangkok: According to semi-official Japanese sources, well-informed sources say that the Franco-Thai agreement (including the terms agreed upon at the Tokyo mediation conference on March 11) will be signed at the end of this month or early next month. The agreement will stipulate detailed measures for adjusting and correcting the border and will appoint a joint border survey committee. At the same time, Thailand will establish a new Vietnamese Affairs Department to manage the recovered territory. It is reported that the two districts of Hoi Sai and Bak Lay in the Plaban area will be renamed Hapri and Miglam to commemorate the commander of the Northern Army and the Prime Minister of Thailand. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Bangkok: Japanese sources say that on March 15, the German Minister to Thailand visited the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs to congratulate Thailand on its restoration of its homeland in the name of the German government. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Editorial

### The United States Implements Lend-Lease and China

At the annual banquet of the United Press Correspondents Association on the evening of the 15th, U.S. President Roosevelt, at the beginning of the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act for military equipment, delivered a solemn and majestic speech explaining the beliefs, responsibilities, actions, and determination to support democratic nations in winning the war against aggression that the United States holds in this decisive world war. In the past, although the U.S. president has repeatedly clarified U.S. policy on international affairs, and has repeatedly stated the meaning and necessity of the Lend-Lease Act, it was not entirely abstract and empty, nor was it entirely to enlighten the opposition, but its nature was only to express the wishes of those who preside over U.S. national affairs. The nature of this speech, however, is different. The President's wishes have been accepted by both houses of Congress and established as the will of the U.S. nation, and he then represented and announced this national will to the world. What is the will of the nation? In modern aggressive countries, their will is the will of their dictator or ruling class. Therefore, it must rise with the rise of the dictator or ruling class, exist with its existence, change with its change, and fall with its fall. The content of the national will in democratic countries is the interests and strength of the whole country, the direction of the whole country, and the achievements it strives for. Now, the full power of the United States has begun to advance towards its will.

In Roosevelt's speech, the principle of supporting democratic nations in winning the war was clearly articulated. Whether in the Far East or Europe, whether for China, Britain, or Greece, or broadly for any anti-aggression democratic nation, all are to be supported equally: the United States is not only Britain's arsenal, not only the arsenal of China, Britain, and Greece, but the arsenal of anti-aggression democratic nations. This arsenal not only does not accept orders for the sale of military equipment but generously provides guarantees for lending military equipment; it clearly provides this to China, Britain, and Greece, and equally provides it to other potentially anti-aggression democratic nations. Therefore, not only have China, Britain, and Greece received support and encouragement, but Turkey, which is already feeling the threat of aggression but is currently lingering in a neutral stage, also expressed its joy yesterday upon hearing the speech, seeing it as an overall guarantee for democratic nations in general and as a death sentence for the so-called new order. Of course, at present, only China, Britain, and Greece are qualified and expect to receive lend-lease from the United States.

The detailed plan of how the United States will lend its military equipment should not be immediately made public. Regarding China, last night's Washington telegram stated: It is credible that Dr. Currie has taken a list, listing the items that China needs. We certainly do not need to know the contents of China's list, nor do we need to compare China's list with that of Britain and Greece. At the same time, we understand that due to the quantity and process of production, this arsenal cannot immediately lend everything on the list at the same time. Furthermore, according to a Washington telegram, the United States believes that "China's position is absolutely different from that of Britain. In a few months, the situation in Britain may take a sharp turn for the worse, while China has long been accustomed to Japan's acute pressure and has no fear of it." Assuming that this is also the view of those in the United States who are in charge of distributing the lend-lease military equipment, we can see how the United States distinguishes between urgency when implementing its Lend-Lease Act. We firmly believe that although China is eagerly hoping for the maximum possible assistance from the United States, and is eagerly hoping for the earliest possible assistance from the United States, it will definitely not be disappointed upon hearing that the United States is supposedly giving Britain and Greece priority assistance. For what China feels disappointed about is not the present but the past. That is, what China believes the United States has missed is not the current urgent assistance to Britain and Greece. If the United States had been able to assist China in its war effort and stop aggression in the Far East after 1931, at least before the war on the Western Front in Europe, then everything would have been half the effort with twice the result. In other words, democratic nations should have adopted a strategy of defeating the aggressors one by one long ago, but should not have sat idly by waiting for the aggressor nations to try out their strategy of defeating them one by one. This is the past that has passed, and China's disappointment and the United States' mistake now only have mutual deep regret and only seek to remedy them together. Moreover, Britain and Greece are currently still in an acute illness stage. For the sake of the entire democratic front of the world, we should be impartial to China and acknowledge the urgency of Britain and Greece's need for assistance. We are confident that this is a fair and just attitude, that is, loyalty to democracy. And China is indeed confident that it can rely on its own strength to eventually bring the aggressors in the Far East to collapse, as long as the United States and British territories, as well as other democratic nations, do not continue to aid and abet the aggressors as before, and continue to supply them with even the slightest amount of materials. This does not mean that China does not need assistance. China will win. Definitive victory is only a matter of time, but the more assistance it receives, the sooner it receives assistance, the faster it will win. Therefore, it is indeed eager for the United States to assist it as soon as possible. Furthermore, it is not only eager but also firmly believes that the United States will definitely assist it as early as possible. This is because the United States' future aid to China, unlike before, is not empty sympathy, not a social courtesy of friendship, that is, it is not that it is enough to express good intentions and fulfill its personnel affairs. It wants this member of the democratic front to win a complete victory, so it must supply it with the military equipment to achieve a complete victory. Only when this member wins a complete victory will the crisis in the Pacific be eliminated and the United States' threat be lifted, and the will of the United States nation will be fulfilled!

Therefore, at this stage, there are two guarantees for China's victory: one is China's self-reliance, and the other is the United States' maximum assistance. With these two guarantees, what does China regret about the fact that the United States' assistance is more urgent to Britain and Greece, which are in an acute illness stage! To put it thoroughly: China is indeed materially and militarily behind Japan. If Japan does not use force to invade China and permanently maintains its superior aggressive power, then China will be permanently under its threat. If Japan changes its plans early, knows that it is difficult and retreats, and manages to maintain its remaining superiority, then China will still be under its threat. If Japan is not "dragged" by China's strategy and hastily wins or loses quickly, or now abruptly withdraws its troops and stops the invasion, then China will still have to be on alert to Japan day and night until the completion of national construction. The threat that the United States and the entire Pacific region feel is also always proportional to China's. However, if China wages a long-term war, and the United States slightly delays aid to China because it urgently aids Britain and Greece, then this is China's stability, and the stability of the United States and the Pacific. On the other hand, until now, that is, until China completes its preparations for a general counter-offensive with self-reliance or foreign assistance, Japan still grasps the last opportunity to change its course, but it absolutely does not have this great wisdom and courage. Its initial strategy was to win quickly, its current fantasy is to seek survival from death, its future luck is to return after a small defeat, and the final misfortune it will encounter is a thorough collapse after a disastrous defeat in a protracted war. From this point of view, among the priorities of the United States in assisting democratic nations, there is naturally one country that is most sacrificed, namely Japan.

In addition, there is something that must be said. Yesterday's Washington telegram mentioned the CCP and the Soviet Union. It was briefly stated that diplomatic circles once speculated that the disputes between Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist Party would hinder American aid to China because the United States was deeply concerned that Chairman Chiang might sever relations with the Soviet Union as a result, creating a difficult diplomatic situation. Since President Roosevelt adopted a sweeping attitude to support the National Government under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and declared that the United States had told China that it would receive our assistance, the aforementioned unfavorable news about China has become unfounded. This was originally unfounded speculation. The reasons for the speculation may be: or because they do not understand that this dispute in Chongqing is a military order issue and not a political issue; or because they do not understand the Soviet Union's basic view of the Sino-Japanese War, which is that in addition to ideology, the Soviet Union's "security first" concept; or because they do not understand that the CCP's conditions are relatively like this hope, not a threat from a friend or enemy; or because the Axis powers have recently launched some diplomatic conspiracies in Moscow, so they spread information to sow discord, such as the Japanese Foreign Minister hiring Germany to pass through Russia, and possibly making a cold smile and firing a cold arrow at the Chongqing dispute in Moscow. It should be known that China is fighting for independence and freedom, and for democracy. China is happy to receive foreign assistance, also for independence, freedom and democracy. China is not exploited of independence and freedom by the Soviet Union because it accepts Soviet assistance, nor is it exploited of independence and freedom by the United States because it accepts American assistance. It should be known that the Soviet Union only wants to have a China that is independent, free, and democratic as its neighbor, and does not want to have a China that is invaded and controlled as its neighbor. Similarly, it wants to have Turkey as its neighbor, and does not want its neighbors Romania and Bulgaria to be like they are today. Then, the United States' aid to China is really what the Soviet Union is happy to hear, and there is no room for doubt. As for the CCP dispute in Chongqing, not only is it far below China's national resistance and construction policy in nature and scope, so there is no need to regard it as very serious, but also the dispute occurred during China's war effort, and the Soviet Union must give consideration to the long-term security of the country first and is unwilling to change Sino-Soviet relations because of this. If this were the time of a Soviet-Japanese war, then China's prevention of the Communist Party from siding with the Soviet Union would make the Soviet Union angry. In short, at present, it is not a Soviet-Japanese war but a Sino-Japanese war, so the Soviet Union absolutely does not want the CCP to deviate from China. President Roosevelt can see this clearly, so he can declare aid to China without hesitation.

Guilin: Since the Ministry of Communications' Xijiang Shipyard improved wooden boats and shallow-water wheel boats, it has achieved considerable results. Over 700 ships were built last year. Recently, due to the shallowness and numerous shoals of the rivers in Guizhou Province, it is very difficult to sail ships during periods of low water. Therefore, "a special power shallow-water wheel boat invented by Tang Zhongming was tested.

### Huge Lend-Lease Appropriation to be Passed by US House of Representatives, Supplies to Britain May be Escorted by Ships, State Department Seeks to Block Leakage Between South America and Vladivostok

Washington: The House of Representatives will complete the US$7 billion Lend-Lease appropriation bill on Wednesday or Thursday of this week, and after it is passed, it will be sent to the Senate. Government leaders firmly believe that attempts to obstruct the bill or reduce the amount in the Senate will not succeed. Currently, there are people moving to reduce the appropriation to $4 billion, with the remaining $2 billion to be used for signing purchasing contracts. (Associated Press telegram of the 17th)

London: A Washington dispatch from the Observer here discusses the issue of the United States escorting its supplies to Britain in times of emergency, saying that everyone in the United States knows that the United States must take any steps necessary to ensure that the equipment requested by British Prime Minister Churchill arrives in Britain. Although there is no explicit provision in the Lend-Lease Act allowing for escort, and Congress has warned the President not to interpret the provisions of the Act as allowing him to escort, the President, as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, has the authority to use loopholes in the Constitution.

Singapore, Gibraltar: Anglo-American Co-management Possible

The Americans are now focusing their attention on aiding Britain and do not have time to think about Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's trip to Germany. Germany is indeed greatly exaggerating the desire to attract attention, but Matsuoka's trip will ultimately not be taken seriously. It is no longer possible for Germany to threaten the American people again and prevent them from joining the war. Hitler can declare war on the United States, but everyone expects that he will not dare to declare war publicly. After the establishment of the Lend-Lease Act, Germany is in a diplomatic predicament and is now eager to flaunt the importance of Matsuoka's trip to Europe, which only reveals its predicament. People here believe that all Matsuoka wants to do is to observe Hitler's war machine. In terms of war objectives, Britain and the United States are currently conducting cooperative talks on the future world society, and the key to the future world society will be held by the English-speaking people. Key areas such as Singapore and Gibraltar can be jointly owned, and Germany's Kiel should be the same when air force preparations are lifted. (Reuters telegram of the 17th)

Stockholm: According to news from London, the British War Office announced that Canadian troops have successively arrived in Gibraltar. Currently, Gibraltar is rushing to build fortifications, and when completed, it can withstand any attack for up to 18 months. (Haitong News Agency telegram of the 17th)

### President Roosevelt's Speech in Full

Washington - As reactions from various national capitals to President Roosevelt's Saturday speech on aid to democratic nations gradually arrive in Washington, diplomatic and political observers here are still studying the full text of the President's speech. Throughout his address, the President strongly attacked aggressor nations and firmly asserted that the United States must ensure the victory of democratic countries. The full text of the President's speech is as follows:

This gathering at the White House

for a press association dinner is a rare occasion. In the past eight years, I have always given a speech at each dinner, but this kind of gathering is still uncommon. This meeting differs from our usual bi-weekly talks because you cannot ask me any questions, and everything I say will be a matter of historical record. For eight years, you and I have helped each other. I have kept you informed of the American President's views on news from Washington, the nation, and the world, and you have kept me informed of the thoughts of our people. In our press conferences, just as at tonight's dinner, there are journalists representing newspapers and news agencies from all over. Many of these reporters are always surprised that there is still a country in the world that holds press conferences like ours. Indeed, in some countries, the freedom of the people no longer exists. In these countries, the purpose of

Democracy

like ours and the nature of our country and people have undergone serious changes. These misunderstandings of democracy are not new. I recall that at the beginning of the First World War, the German government listened to the words of its representatives in the United States, who said that the American people would never unite, that the American people valued peace more than preserving their ideals and freedom, and would seek peace at any cost, and that if the United States prioritized its own interests, it could incite turmoil and revolution. Today, we must ensure that the dictators of Europe and Asia no longer doubt our unity. Since the outbreak of this war on September 1, 1939, I have been more concerned about the future of the world than many people. The historical record shows that my concerns were not comprehensive enough. The floodwaters have now breached the floodgates. We should now reflect on the past and determine where the fault lies. History can never be rewritten with hopeful thoughts. The American people today are

Writing New History

The biggest news story this week is that we have announced to the world that our country is united, that we recognize the dangers ahead, and that our democracy has begun to move to meet the dangers. We know that Prussian autocracy was utterly vile, and we now know that Nazism is even more vile. The Nazis' intentions are not merely to change the map of colonies, nor merely to change small parts of Europe's borders. The Nazi Party has openly sought to destroy the electoral systems of all governments on the world's continents, including our own. The Nazi Party also wants to build a system of government based on the militarization of all mankind, ruled by those who seize power by force. The Nazi Party and all its hypnotized followers call this political system the "New Order." This is neither "new" nor "order," because international order refers to something that can last, in other words, a kind of

Justice System

in which mankind is willing to live for a long time. Mankind will never want to live permanently in a system established by conquerors and based on slavery. These new-style tyrants, in order to realize their plans, all want to destroy all democratic politics, to destroy the countries of Europe and our country one by one, and we do not agree with this goal. That is why we are acting today. In 1939 and 1940, the Nazis were already carrying out their plans to eliminate European countries, and they would not stop until their predetermined plans were smashed by the indomitable British defense. The enemies of democratic politics have erred in their estimates for one very simple reason. They believe that democratic politics cannot adjust itself to cope with the terrible facts of the war world. Their error lies in this. They also believe that democratic politics, because it respects human rights too much, will never be able to arm itself and go to war. They also believe that democratic politics, because it is willing to coexist peacefully with its neighbors, will not be able to mobilize its forces to defend itself, or even to defend itself. Little did they know that this belief was their

Mistake

The Axis powers, from the information they obtained from their propaganda machines, believed that conquering the United States could be achieved through "internal work," that is, not by attacking the United States from the outside by force, but by launching disruptive, divisive, alienating, and destructive morale-boosting efforts within the United States to achieve their aggressive goals. Anyone who believes that the United States can be conquered by "internal work" does not understand the history of the United States. It must be known that the United States is not a country that can be destroyed by appeasers, defeatists, and terror mongers from the back door. The United States is a country that discusses its own problems in broad daylight, so that everyone can hear these discussions. We have just engaged in a great debate. This debate is not only heard by those in the halls of Congress. Every newspaper and every radio has commented on this debate. The final solution and decision of this debate is made by the American people

Themselves. The decision-making of our democratic politics is inevitably slow, but once a decision is made, the person who announces this decision is not any individual, but 130 million American people. After the announcement, we are all bound by it. The people of the world should no longer doubt this fact. Our decision today is still to stop any attempts at appeasement in our country, to stop our country from colluding with those dictators, and to stop our country from compromising with those tyrants and oppressive forces. The current situation is very urgent. We firmly believe that when our production reaches sufficient levels, the democratic countries of the world will be able to prove that dictators cannot win. But at the moment, the relationship of time is extremely important. We will send every extra aircraft and every other piece of war equipment, new or old, that we have to foreign countries. This is a common-sense strategy. The major task and the heavy responsibility we bear now is to immediately transport the production piled up in factories to the front lines of democratic countries. If we can maintain our current unity, speed and efficiency can be achieved. We do not have and will never have a false unity of mankind that is threatened or seduced by propaganda. Our unity can only exist in the

Free Mankind

who can recognize the truth and deal with facts with wisdom and courage. Finally, the only guarantee of future security is that a year ago, we began to build countless factories and train a large number of talents. Therefore, when the Aid to Democracy Act was passed, we were prepared to produce based on our current planned capacity and requested an appropriation of seven trillion dollars. The text of the article itself included all of the ammunition and the convenience of its transportation. The Aid to Democracy Act was passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives on Tuesday afternoon of last week. Half an hour later, I signed it. Five minutes later, I approved an item for immediate shipment, many of which are already en route. On Wednesday, I requested an appropriation of seven trillion for new materials, and Congress quickly passed the appropriation with patriotic enthusiasm. In the meantime, what we are currently considering is speed. I hope that the word speed will soon be known to every household in the country. Each of us must make sacrifices, and the extent of the sacrifices must depend on the speed at which we act now. Tonight, I must tell you in frank terms what this move means for you and your daily lives. Whether you are serving in the military or are a steelworker, dockworker, machinist, housewife, farmer, banker, shopkeeper, or manufacturer, you must sacrifice for the freedom of the country and yourselves. In your

Daily Life

you will feel the impact of this massive effort. You will feel many inconveniences in this effort. Please be willing to earn lower profits in business, because your taxes will obviously increase. Whether you are farming or working, you must work more. I can say clearly that what the country needs to sacrifice is special rights, not fundamental rights. Most of us are willing to make this kind of sacrifice. This kind of sacrifice is for the public security and happiness of the country, for defending against the most barbaric atrocities in history, and for achieving the final victory of the way of life that is currently under serious threat. If our efforts are perfunctory, they will surely fail. This is not something that can be done by taking out a part of the time. Before this work is completed, we should put aside the concepts of "business as usual" and "business as usual." We should devote all our efforts to it, otherwise we will not be able to win. From now on, we should devote ourselves to constantly increasing the speed of production, to a greater production than we have ever known before, and to a production that never stops and never rests. Therefore, tonight, I am appealing to the emotions and reason of all patriotic men and women in our country. I ask you to consider the needs of our country at this time and eliminate all

Personal Opinions

until we achieve victory. The glory of democratic politics should be maintained forever, and everyone has the responsibility to maintain the glory of democratic politics. Individual efforts alone seem small, but it must be known that our country now has 130 million individuals. In Britain and elsewhere, there are tens of millions of people who are bravely protecting the giant flame of democratic politics from being extinguished by barbarism. The American people alone are not enough to undertake this great task. (To be continued)

### British Troops Enter Turkey

New York - National Broadcasting Company correspondent Stanley reported to the Associated Press last night that British troops are now entering Turkey. (Associated Press dispatch on the 17th)

Vichy - There are also paratroopers in Turkey. According to a dispatch from the Vichy News Agency in Istanbul, the Turkish Ministry of the Army announced that the Turkish Army's paratroopers will conduct exercises this week, and newly formed units to defend against paratroopers will also participate in the performance, showing that the Turkish Army has made much modern progress.

### British Troops in East Africa Achieve Victory, Recapture the City of Babiira, Belgian Troops Also Occupy Asosa, Fighting in Keren Becomes More Intense

London - British troops have recaptured Babiira, the capital of British Somaliland. According to a Cairo communique, the British flag is flying over Babiira on the Red Sea coast again. The city was captured by the Italians shortly after Italy entered the war last summer. However, British troops have recently been advancing from all directions and recaptured it after a rapid joint operation yesterday. British troops landed and occupied the city after effective bombardment by the air and sea forces. The communique also stated that British troops have continued to make progress in the Keren area of Eritrea, occupying several important heights. Within Abyssinia, the British Imperial forces and the Abyssinian patriotic forces are continuing to advance on all sides, causing deep unease to the Italians. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

Cairo - The British Imperial forces have won a great victory in Italian Somaliland, mainly because their advance was rapid and unexpected, completely overturning the enemy's estimates. According to news received from military circles in Cairo, the commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in Somaliland did not dream that the British would launch an attack before the rainy season, three months earlier than expected. The Italian troops seemed stunned to see that the British troops were well-equipped and that the motor transport vehicles were moving rapidly. The Italian local troops were demoralized because they were not paid and their food and equipment were poor. In addition, the Italian side relied too much on the Juba River, believing that the river was a natural defense that was impregnable. Unexpectedly, the British troops broke through it in one fell swoop. Military officials added that, judging from the situation, the feelings between the Italian regular army and the Fascist Party members were extremely bad. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

Cairo - A German High Command communique stated that Belgian troops, fighting side by side with British troops in Abyssinia, have occupied Asosa, and that British troops entering the southern part of Abyssinia from Italian Somaliland are now continuing to advance into various areas. As for Libya and Eritrea, there is nothing to report. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

London - An Italian communique today stated that the fighting in the Keren area of Eritrea has now become more intense and that Greek offensives have been repulsed. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

Large British Force Continues to Enter Greece

Yugoslav Capital - According to a British diplomatic source in Istanbul, 150,000 British troops equipped for combat have long been stationed in northeastern Thrace, less than fifty miles from German troops. It is said that another 150,000 British troops have boarded transport ships and are on their way to Thrace, with up to 10,000 troops landing in Greece every day. The British troops dispatched to Greece include many divisions of Australian and South African mechanized units. 50,000 British troops are now rushing from Haifa to join the 150,000 troops already in Thrace, forming a first-line expeditionary force of 200,000 to defend Greece and Salonika. The remaining 100,000 first-line British troops are on their way to other ports in Greece, to be used as reserve troops. (International News Agency dispatch on the 17th)

New York - The New York Times received a dispatch from the Yugoslav capital stating that, according to diplomatic sources and well-informed political and military experts there, a war in the Balkans before the summer, fought by Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece, and Britain on a common front, is almost unavoidable.

### Darlan Goes to Paris for Consultations on Food and Post-War Problems, Food Panic in France Is Extremely Serious, Special Courts Are Organized to Strictly Prohibit Hoarding

Vichy - French Deputy Prime Minister Darlan again arrived in Paris from Vichy yesterday. This is Darlan's seventh trip to Paris and he will not return to Vichy until Thursday of this week. Darlan is in Paris to discuss with German Ambassador Abetz, mainly on the issue of the revival of the Free French Zone. Before France can guarantee that American wheat, milk, food, and meat that Britain allows to pass through the blockade will not flow into the Axis countries, Darlan must first negotiate this matter with the German side. Darlan's request that the food produced in France must supply all the French people in the occupied and unoccupied zones is a fundamental economic issue for both zones. Relying solely on the American economy and the German side not opening the occupied zone is still not enough to sustain it. Therefore, various economic and industrial negotiations are currently underway between Germany and France. (Associated Press dispatch on the 17th)

Vichy - The food shortage situation in France is becoming increasingly serious, and merchants are secretly hoarding and raising "black market" prices. In view of this, the government authorities have decided to establish special courts to crack down on hoarding and the "black market," and later to prohibit all illegal transactions. In other words, anyone who violates the food management law, attempts to hoard, engages in illegal transactions, and raises prices from them will be severely punished by this court. In serious cases, the death penalty may be imposed. The government originally intended to treat food profiteers as criminals who have committed crimes against the state and hand them over to the military court in Caen for trial. However, because the food panic is becoming more and more serious, the government has had to set up special courts to quickly banish the "black market." This court is completely independent in the judicial and administrative system and is not subject to the jurisdiction of other courts, but is directly subordinate to the Ministry of Justice. All judges are appointed by the Ministry of Justice. The litigation procedures are quite simple, and it is not difficult to quickly judge such cases. As for the severity of the sentence, it must not only be determined by the nature of the crime, but also by the economic and psychological consequences that this type of crime may cause. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

Vichy - Vichy Ambassador to the occupied zone of France, Bielleyun, issued an article yesterday after inspecting various places in the occupied zone, saying that there is no question of France declaring war on Britain, but that France must adopt strict plans to seek revival when implementing the policy of cooperation with Germany and seek benefits from the difficult lessons we have learned. According to a Washington dispatch received by the Vichy News Agency, Vichy Ambassador to the United States, Hay Henry, met with US Secretary of State Hull for an hour yesterday to discuss the matter of supplying food to France. Hull claimed that he had contacted the British blockade authorities on this matter. Hay Henry later told people that the Vichy government is willing to have Americans manage the distribution of foreign food in the unoccupied zone. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

Washington - Well-informed people here claim that the negotiations between Washington and London are expected to result in Britain changing its blockade measures against France. The United States is currently engaged in mediation and seems to be siding with France slightly. The US government believes that France does not need to break with Britain, so it is hoped that Britain will compromise. (Haitong Agency dispatch on the 17th)

### Britain Will Register Men and Women Starting Next Month to Allocate Work and Serve the Country

London - British Minister of Labor Bevan said in a broadcast on Sunday that starting next month, British men between the ages of 41 and 45 and women between the ages of 20 and 21 must register to take on work that is of great importance to the country. The men who register on April 5 will be those who are not employed by a certain industry. At that time, the government can find out whether they have an important profession and place those who are unemployed in a career that can serve the country. Women who register will be summoned when needed to determine whether they can serve in important national jobs. Women who have young children or have major family responsibilities will not be slightly employed. He believes that the American people will definitely be able to show their ability and determination to defeat Hitler. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

The company's manager, Sloan, recently appealed to the nation to postpone the purchase of vehicles so that the factory can manufacture as much national defense equipment as possible.

### British Air Force Can Control German Aircraft's Daytime Activity, British Side Expects Germany to Intensify Attacks on Merchant Ships When the Weather Improves

London - Labor Party leader and Lord Privy Seal Attlee said in a speech yesterday that British-made and British-piloted aircraft defeated the German air force, which had a numerically large advantage, last fall. The British are now launching a counter-offensive against Germany with their labor and manpower, making Germany regret launching the air war. Hitler has repeatedly said that his 70 million Germans are ready to attack Britain, forgetting that hundreds of millions of British people are now voluntarily coming to Britain from overseas to fight for the cause, thus making a big mistake. Britain has Churchill and the United States has Roosevelt, both of whom are talented and far-sighted and are the same as each other. By using them to defeat the enemy, the future is indeed guaranteed. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

London - German aircraft sneaked into a town in western England last night and dropped hundreds of high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs, but only a few places caught fire. There was a short-time alert in London last night, but no enemy aircraft attacked. The Aviation Department had nothing to report yesterday during the day. The German High Command announced last night that, as of yesterday, the total number of German aircraft that had been shot down by British fighters and anti-aircraft guns during the moonlight raids on Britain was. The German communique on Thursday had admitted that six German aircraft had not returned overnight, and had not released the daily losses of German aircraft since then, until last night when it admitted that twenty German aircraft had been lost in moonlight raids on Britain since Wednesday night. The British side announced that it had destroyed twenty-seven German aircraft during this period. According to a Reuters air force correspondent, in the past two days, the German public has been unaware of whether German bombers have "returned safely" because the official has not announced it. All they have seen are exaggerated British losses. On Saturday night, German aircraft attacked and fled back when the bright moon was about to rise. This was not because German aircraft wanted to avoid the moonlight, but because there was fog in Europe, which threatened to envelop their base. Therefore, the range and scope of German aircraft's attacks were limited. The loss of German aircraft's night raids last week did not exceed one-tenth, while the night activities of the German air force had to lose at least one-tenth to be seriously affected. The activities of German aircraft during the day are not the same. The British Aviation Department communique said, "Nothing to report," which shows that German aircraft have not been able to penetrate deep into the British mainland, because the British air force has taken daytime control in British airspace. When the weather improves, German aircraft are expected to intensify their daytime attacks on British ships. The British Navy's weekly communique does not detail the tonnage of British ships sunk, so it is not easy to measure whether German aircraft have succeeded in attacking British ships during the day. British coastal bombers are now also stepping up counter-attacks on enemy ships, and the coastal command's defensive weapons are being strengthened, and their strength is becoming more and more powerful. In addition, the Aviation Department announced that the British Air Force's latest Wave-type night fighters are now also being used for long-distance activities. It is known that a coastal command bomber that was previously reported missing on Saturday night has safely returned to its defense. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

London - Last night and this morning, German bombers were hampered by heavy fog and only launched sporadic attacks on the British coast. German aircraft's daytime activities over the British Isles were also hampered by fog. A city on the west coast was attacked by fire and lightning after dusk, but fire wardens quickly extinguished the incendiary bombs as soon as they were dropped, reducing the losses to a minimum. The British Air Force's activities last night were also hampered by fog, but Dusseldorf and Lorraine were still heavily attacked by the British side. It was revealed here yesterday that when German aircraft raided London on Saturday night, a Nazi bomb hit a dance hall outside the city and a nearby bus. Many dancers and all passengers in the car were killed on the spot. (International News Agency dispatch on the 17th)

### British Rayon Factory Sold to the United States

New York - It was revealed here last night that Britain has sold the American Valley Kos Company to 17 American banks. The company is a large rayon manufacturer and the largest British industry in the United States. The company's assets are worth $25 million, employs 18,000 people, and owns seven factories. The proceeds from the sale will be used to purchase weapons and ammunition. British Treasury Representative Sir Peacock announced the sale of the factory at the Wall Street office. Peacock said, "Because of the friendship and mutual trust between the two sides, the sale of the factory can be completed in a short period of time." Morgan Stanley Company and Dillon Lent Company are the representatives of the buyers of the factory. It is reported that the United States purchased

### Germany Re-establishes Consulate in Tangier

Madrid - The German Consulate in Tangier, which was closed after the World War in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles, was reopened yesterday in a solemn ceremony. In the past twenty years, the building has been used as the residence of the Rabat Sultan's representative in Tangier. The house was moved out yesterday morning. Two hours later, the German flag fluttered on its roof. German and Spanish representatives were present, and a Spanish squad presented arms in salute. (Haitong Agency dispatch on the 17th)

### Soviet Union and Switzerland Approve Commercial Agreement

Moscow: The commercial agreement between the Soviet Union and Switzerland has been approved by both governments and came into effect today. According to this agreement, the Soviet Union will exchange agricultural products, timber, and gasoline for Swiss machinery and industrial supplies. Although the Soviet Union has recently concluded commercial agreements with various countries, such as the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with Hungary last December, and subsequent economic negotiations with Bulgaria, and a commercial agreement with Slovakia on December 6, and an agreement with Japan to extend the fisheries agreement between the two countries, the scope of economic negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union is even more extensive. As for the economic negotiations between the Soviet Union and Romania, an agreement has also been reached on issues of commerce and navigation. All of these demonstrate that the Soviet Union's diplomatic activities have three main objectives: (1) to establish friendly relations with neighboring countries, (2) to develop foreign trade, and (3) to develop domestic economic and industrial life. The Soviet newspapers believe that this policy is the only way to strengthen the Soviet Union's inviolable position without being drawn into the current European war vortex. It is considered "firm and wise." (Havas dispatch, 17th)

### Hitler Orders the Construction of a Memorial for Fallen Soldiers and Inspects Wounded Soldiers in Sochos. German Residents in Turkey Hold a Meeting to Commemorate Fallen Heroes

Berlin: German leader Hitler ordered yesterday, on the Memorial Day for Fallen Soldiers, the construction of a memorial for fallen soldiers.

Subsequently, German Ambassador Papen thanked the guests. After the military band played the German and Turkish national anthems, the principal of the Turkish Military Academy, on behalf of the Turkish military, laid a wreath on the tomb of Commander Goertz.

### American Train Derails, Causing Many Casualties. It is Rumored that the Accident Was Caused by Sabotage

Batan: A Pennsylvania eastbound passenger train derailed five carriages last night one mile east of here. Four carriages fell into the Ohio River. Company officials claim that the accident was caused by sabotage. At least three people died, nine were seriously injured, and countless others were slightly injured. The spikes on one of the tracks were pulled out, and the bolts connecting the two tracks were also removed. Railway officials said that the wires for the electrical signals were not cut; otherwise, the signals would not work, and the train would automatically stop. The baggage car, smoking car, passenger car, and dining car all fell into the river beside the road, but were not completely submerged. Hundreds of passengers broke the windows and climbed to the riverbank. After being wrapped in sheets, they were taken to the hospital by relief trains. Eighteen minutes before the accident, the eastbound Manhattan Company train also passed over the same railway without incident. It is believed that the saboteurs' target was originally the Manhattan Company train, as that train had two locomotives and thirteen carriages, eleven of which carried passengers.

### International Anecdotes (10): The Third Term of American President Roosevelt: A Daily Record

Since Roosevelt has served as the President of the United States for eight years, his daily life has been more or less consistent, becoming a stereotypical routine that few can match. In his habits, there are only about three things that have changed or improved:

Previously, he used to swim five times a week in the White House swimming pool, but now it has been reduced to three times. He usually swims at 5:30 PM, immersing himself in the water for 20 to 25 minutes, practicing various water-based exercises to strengthen his body. Dr. McIntyre of the White House believes that since Roosevelt is already 59 years old and entering his declining years, swimming three times a week is sufficient in theory. However, Roosevelt's chest and arms are still very strong when paddling in the water. The temperature of the water in the swimming pool is usually maintained at 75 degrees. After swimming, Dr. McIntyre's assistant, George Fox, gives the President a full-body massage for about 40 minutes. This massage is still performed as usual even on days when he does not swim. Roosevelt's weight is usually maintained at a balanced weight, always between 184 and 188 pounds. In the past eight years, there have been very few times when he has exceeded 190 pounds.

President Roosevelt has a hobby of collecting old stamps, which he uses to relieve work-related fatigue. Sometimes he also sends stamps to auction houses. Since becoming a three-term President, this interest has diminished slightly due to busy official duties. Every day, bundles of mail are sent from the State Department to the Presidential Palace. He cuts out and keeps the old stamps. In addition, people from all over often send him old stamps as gifts. He glues them one by one into stamp albums, and a bowl of warm water is placed on his desk, in which he soaks the stamps before personally tearing them off the envelopes. He always carries a bag of old stamps and two stamp albums with him when he goes boating every week, personally gluing them in and enjoying himself. Roosevelt used to spend several hours a week on stamp collecting, but now he feels very happy if he can enjoy it once a week.

The value of Roosevelt's collection of old stamps has never been made public. It is said that he does not have any rare stamps, and their value is also average. However, in the eyes of most people, since he owns more than 100 stamp albums, 60 of which are kept in the White House, and several dozens in his private residence in Hyde Park, including many stamps inherited from his uncle, plus his own collection over half his life and the cooperation of stamp collecting experts from all sides for at least eight years since he became President, who would believe that his collection is just a collection of ordinary items collected in large quantities?

The third habit change is watching fewer movies. The White House movie room is located in a hall on the second floor, and it is screened several times a week. In the past, Roosevelt was not always present, but he was in the majority of screenings. After watching the movie, he would go to his study and work for a few more hours. This was his usual habit. Now, because he cannot spare the time, he only watches an average of two movies a month. The films in the White House are donated by various film companies' distributors and are selected in advance by Secretary O'Leary. The hall is equipped with a screen and projector, and a sound system worth US$25,000, which was installed during the term of former President Hoover. When the President is alone, reviewing official documents or answering letters in the circular study a few steps away, Mrs. Roosevelt, guests, the White House switchboard operators, cooks, and maids often watch movies there.

Watching movies in the White House is very comfortable. Everyone sits casually in chairs, and the walls are decorated, making it very quiet. When President Roosevelt is happy to watch a movie, he sits in the first or second row of chairs. If the movie is a light-hearted short film, then some comedy shorts are also inserted. When his wife or female elders are present, he often "cracks jokes," as the saying goes, when he encounters a film that suits his taste, making them surprised and laugh. He loves to watch newsreels or Disney cartoons. Last winter, he was greatly impressed by the famous Chaplin film "The Great Dictator" and the colorful "Red Horse Cavalry." If the film being screened does not suit his old man's taste, he will frankly "abandon it halfway." Then the black servant, Brediman, helps him up from his chair and walks into his study to rest or work, as he pleases.

Roosevelt's private study, with walls hung with ship maps and models, has been described earlier. His desk is full of knick-knacks, mostly donkeys. Small bookshelves are equipped with "The World Almanac," the Bible, Bartlett's "Familiar Quotations," and "Practical Standard Dictionary." The desk is also often cluttered with packets of old stamps and a box of cigars. The President himself often smokes "Camel" cigarettes, and cigars are only for treating guests.

Speaking of Roosevelt's reduced stamp collecting and movie watching, it reminds us of the changes in the lives of previous White House occupants. At that time, the life of the President was very leisurely and enviable. President Coolidge used to take naps for several hours in the afternoon; after President Theodore Roosevelt did three or four hours of busy work, he would spend the afternoon boxing and practicing jujitsu. Sometimes, when he had nothing to do in the afternoon, he would accompany his wife's niece for a walk in the countryside, or spend half a day in the billiard room.

President Roosevelt lives in the museum on the second floor of the White House. The walls inside are covered with nautical charts. On the large marble mantelpiece above the fireplace are about thirty ceramic pigs, the largest being five inches tall, gradually decreasing to two and a half inches. The tallest one is placed in the center, and the others are arranged sequentially from high to low on either side. In addition, there are photos of Mrs. Roosevelt and his old friends, interspersed with various styles of wooden and copper donkeys.

His bedroom is also the most casual place in the White House. The newspapers and magazines piled in the second-floor hall are often several months old. Many of the ship drawings and models he collects are often placed together arbitrarily, with no special reason to follow. Roosevelt Sr. liked to collect Christmas cards. His secretary, Ms. Lehen, kept his beloved ones in boxes labeled with the year. There are now more than 3,000 of these Christmas cards.

### Electricity Company Calls on the Public to Voluntarily Reduce Electricity Consumption. Yesterday, They Hosted Reporters to Explain the Reasons for Electricity Conservation, but There Is No Need to Worry as Fuel Sources Have Not Been Cut Off

The Shanghai Power Company, feeling that its fuel sources are becoming increasingly difficult, has presented a plan to the Municipal Authorities to announce temporary electricity reduction measures, which have inevitably had a considerable impact on larger-scale industries and businesses. Shanghai's abnormal prosperity has dimmed, and with the unstable situation in the Far East, there is a trend of decline. Therefore, the public is confused. In view of this, the company invited Chinese and foreign reporters from the city to the company's reception room on the sixth floor at 10:30 AM yesterday, where Superintendent P.S. Hopkins gave a speech explaining the company's reasons for implementing electricity reduction measures due to unavoidable circumstances and reporting on the various steps to be taken in the future. The original manuscript was in English, and it is translated as follows:

No Need to Panic Within Six Months

There is no new news to report today regarding the fuel shortage problem. However, due to recent rumors in the newspapers that are inaccurate, you have been invited here to discuss this matter. I should report the following facts to you: (1) Even if no more fuel arrives in the future, the fuel currently stored by the Shanghai Power Company can still last for three months. (2) Under normal circumstances, the Shanghai Power Company can usually obtain sufficient coal to meet 50% of its needs. With existing reserves and new goods about to arrive, there is enough to last for six months, so there is no need to worry about shortages. (3) As the war is in progress and the number of ships is decreasing daily, fuel consumption should be reduced to prevent future problems. A decision will be made after sufficient coal reserves are obtained.

Public Utilities Maintain the Status Quo

(4) Road lights, transportation, drainage, and hospital services are related to the safety of residents' lives and should be maintained as they are. The Shanghai Power Company will never cut off the supply of electricity for these services. This should be stated clearly. (5) However, if we recklessly waste fuel or hesitate and fail to implement restrictions immediately, there will come a day when we will face the risk of running out of X-rays. (6) The Shanghai Power Company and the Public Works Department have taken the necessary steps since the first day that normal ships no longer came to Shanghai.

Fair Distribution, Expert Research

(7) The various steps taken by the Shanghai Power Company and the Public Works Department are as follows: (A) Hiring industrial experts to form a preparatory committee to study methods of reducing electricity consumption and the problems that will arise for workers and capital. (B) Hiring independent economic experts and engineers to form a committee. (C) Reducing electricity consumption by 30% for large electricity users. This is a preliminary measure for future electricity distribution. Although this measure is not scientific or fair, it is the only step that can be taken before a detailed plan is determined. (D) After the committee completes its research on a fair distribution plan, important electricity users will no longer be subject to this restriction, or the restrictions they are subject to may be modified.

Drastic Measures May Be Taken

(E) The Public Works Department and the Shanghai Power Company will impose a fine of three times the excess electricity consumption on users who exceed their allocated amount. The purpose of this is purely to conserve electricity, not to increase revenue. (F) If necessary, drastic measures will be taken in future electricity distribution, sacrificing a small number of people to protect the majority. (8) The authorities have made every effort to cooperate to solve the current coal shortage problem and find ways to solve it. We have done everything possible. Since the war is in progress, it will not be possible to send ships to Shanghai in the short term. At the same time, we hope that we can voluntarily reduce electricity consumption.

Calling on the Public to Cooperate

(9) I am asking for your assistance in informing the public to voluntarily reduce electricity consumption and not to take a wait-and-see attitude. Secondly, do not interfere with or disturb the work of the committee. They are talented and are fully committed to studying this issue, hoping to meet the needs of the greatest number of people to the greatest extent. They have no time to consider private interests. They only consider general principles and can only grant exemptions or exceptions for absolutely essential businesses. (10) The Shanghai Power Company has entrusted the entire issue of electricity distribution to the committee. If the Shanghai Power Company handled this issue, it would inevitably be biased.

Using Oil to Generate Electricity Is Quite Effective

(11) The company currently has 150,000 tons of coal. The company needs 50,000 tons of coal per month. Currently, the reliable amount of coal coming in is 25,000 tons per month. The current coal shortage is 15,000 tons per month. (12) The company anticipated the risk of a coal shortage, so it used oil instead of coal. The equipment for generating electricity with oil cost about 500,000 yuan, and the results were very successful. Unfortunately, obtaining oil is just as difficult as obtaining coal. (13) It is estimated that when the electricity distribution plan is implemented, fuel will be reduced to below 100,000 tons.

Industrial Electricity Consumption is the Largest

(14) The power industry is undeniable. All we can do is try our best to conserve electricity for industrial use so that factories can continue to employ a large number of workers. (15) The Shanghai Power Company supplies 96% of the industrial electricity consumption in the Public Concession. (16) From December to January last year, the Shanghai Power Company consumed a total of 51,349 tons of coal and oil, which was distributed as follows: street lights 377 tons, Public Works Department drainage, etc. 633 tons, public utilities, tap water, telephone, tram, tap fire, public buses 2,535 tons, light, heat, electric stoves, etc. 9,700 tons, small-scale industrial electricity 5,194 tons, large-scale industrial electricity 32,914 tons, totaling 51,349 tons. It should be noted that of the 51,349 tons, 38,000 tons (accounting for 74%) are used by industry. Therefore, electricity reduction is closely related to labor issues. (17) I hope that all parties can cooperate and use electricity economically.

Users Can Only Control Themselves

(18) The difficulty lies in the fact that electricity is a "service" rather than a "commodity," so it is impossible to adopt a per capita distribution method or a centralized control method. Users can only manage themselves. (19) We cannot guarantee that Shanghai will have sufficient fuel coming in. We have reported this situation to the authorities of various countries and believe that they will assist us in solving this problem as soon as possible. What I want to report is complete. Now, I will share my opinions with you:

Prepare to Get Through the Restriction Period

(A) We do not need to worry about the current situation. We only need to prepare to get through a truly restricted period. (B) Shanghai is a neurotic city. Those who are inexperienced and unable to adapt to the facts will suffer the most. The problem of fuel shortage in Shanghai can be easily solved if more ships can be obtained. However, some people are acting like crazy people and hoarding coal and oil, which is really difficult to understand. (C) Although Shanghai is short of fuel, it has not reached the point where raw materials cannot be manufactured due to a lack of electricity.

Prepare to Deal with the New Situation

I only ask that you convey this opinion to the public, asking them to save electricity and make various preparations to deal with the new situation after electricity distribution. At the same time, limit their electricity consumption so that it does not exceed the number of degrees of electricity used by the Shanghai Power Company that they are notified of in writing. Do not let the public take rash actions or make arbitrary statements due to panic. Before the distribution of electricity plan drafted by the committee is approved by the Public Works Department, please do not request accommodation from the Shanghai Power Company and the committee by letter or telephone. Finally, I believe that all users, except for the most important services, will be subject to the restrictions of the new plan, which is unavoidable. Fortunately, there are not many of these important services.

Still Have a Large Amount of Coal Arriving in Shanghai

According to Mr. Hopkins, the company's fuel sources are not completely cut off, and it is still purchased every month, but the amount is limited and only enough for a portion of the needs. Kailan coal is currently the largest supplier of coal consumed. The cooperation between the Kailan Mining Company and the company is very satisfactory. It is said that they have agreed to supply the company with 25,000 tons of coal per month. He also reported the amount of coal consumed over the years, which was 50,000 tons per month in 19. At a time when the source of coal from North China cannot be normalized, and the current coal reserves must be prepared for emergency use, we urgently hope that citizens will do their best to save. He did not disclose the amount of coal reserves. Mr. Hopkins continued that the Yangshupu Power Plant is in the process of converting coal-burning equipment to oil-burning equipment, and the results are good.

French Water and Electricity Company Statement

Reporters from the Dazhong News Agency also visited the French Water and Electricity Company. According to company staff, there have been many misunderstandings in the outside world after the company announced its measures to restrict the supply of electricity. For example, it was said that the electric hair dryers in barber shops and the electric fans and electric lights advertised in households would be prohibited. Residents, not understanding the truth, have been asking questions. In fact, the restriction on electricity consumption only applies to those who consume more than 500 degrees per month. Users below 500 degrees are temporarily not restricted. It is extremely rare for barber shops and general stores to use 500 degrees of electricity. It was also said that the main target of this measure is still users who consume between 2,500 and 10,000 degrees per month. There are fewer than 50 of these users, but they are the largest customers of the water and electricity company.

### Remarkable Achievements in China's Economic Construction

The English-language Great American Evening Post stated that since Weng Wenhao took charge of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of China, it has made considerable achievements in strengthening various government enterprises, encouraging and assisting commercial factories and mines, developing the rural economy, and managing general economic affairs. It is said that the 26 factories and mines operated by the government last year all had considerable profits. The second important task of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is how to promote and assist private enterprises. From the outbreak of the war until the end of 1938, the Ministry was busy assisting 300 private factories and mines to move from the coastal areas to the interior. As of October 1939, 234 factories had resumed operation in the interior with its assistance. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has spared no effort in promoting the increase in various production volumes. The production of coal, iron, and steel has increased. Regarding the development of the rural economy, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has made every effort to increase the production of grain, clothing, and other export goods. This situation is most evident in Yunnan, Sichuan, and other provinces. In addition to providing technical, transportation, and marketing assistance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has also tried to implement rural loans. The benefits to the rural economy are not superficial.

### Coffin Makers' Strike Resolved

The carpenters who specialize in making coffins in Shanghai used to organize the Fangzu Guild Hall. There were many workers from both the North and South Cities, scattered in various guild halls, public offices, and funeral shops. This time, due to the sharp rise in rice prices and high cost of living, the wages earned by the workers every day were not enough to support their families. Therefore, last month, the workers elected representatives to gather and discuss, demanding that the capitalists, various guild halls, public offices, and funeral shops increase wages and rice subsidies to maintain their livelihoods. It is now learned that the guild hall representatives Ji Wenliang, Xu Yuchang, Jin Fuqing, Jin Jisheng, etc., invited more than 100 capitalists, pushed out representatives Fa Maochang, Lian Dexing, Sun Rongji, Li Bingsheng, Xie Sheng, Qian Zhengqing, Guang Wanfu, Yao Dexing, etc., at 2:00 PM on the 8th of this month, in the Fangzu Guild Hall. As a result of the sincere discussion between the representatives of labor and capital, the workers in both the North and South Cities were allowed to increase their wages by 60% from the 15th of this month. There should be no discrepancies. The two sides mutually abide by the agreement. Regarding rice subsidies, both the North and South Cities will uniformly calculate according to the agreed price of 14 yuan per stone last year. There should be no more changes. After the terms were agreed upon, the two sides immediately passed the resolution and signed a contract, which was distributed as a notice for all guild halls, public offices, funeral shops, etc. to abide by and implement. The strike was peacefully resolved.

### Irish Residents in Shanghai Celebrate National Day Yesterday: Wreath-Laying Ceremony at the Peace Statue in the Morning; British Ambassador and Others Attend Luncheon Banquet

British and Irish residents in Shanghai commemorated St. Patrick's Day (Irish National Day) yesterday (the 17th). At 8:00 AM, Mr. Craig, President of the St. Patrick's Society of this city, led the members in laying a wreath in front of the Peace Statue on the Bund in the misty rain, as per tradition. Afterwards, the group proceeded to the Jing'an Temple Cemetery to lay wreaths at the graves of five soldiers of the Irish Royal Ulster Rifles of the British Army who died during the Shanghai battle in 1937. "A" Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps also dispatched a small detachment to lay wreaths at the cemetery.

Grand Ball Suspended

In previous years, the Irish residents in Shanghai would hold a grand ball on St. Patrick's Day. This year, due to the war situation, the ball, and other events, were cancelled to conserve resources. Only a luncheon banquet was held at the Shanghai Club at noon, with a large number of guests attending. Those present included the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Consul-General George, and representatives from various foreign residents' associations in Shanghai.

American Officials Attend Banquet

American officials who were invited to the banquet included Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Patrol Fleet, U.S. Consul General Lockwood, U.S. Judge Advocate General Helmick, and Colonel Baker, Commander of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment. At 8:00 PM last night, Mr. Craig, President of the St. Patrick's Society, gave a speech on the XCDN radio station, stating that the purpose of the Shanghai St. Patrick's Society is to promote connections and friendship among Irish residents in the Far East and to provide relief to impoverished residents.

### "Special Police" Took Over Jurisdiction of the Western District Yesterday Morning: Traffic Control Also Taken Over

The establishment of the "Special Police Force" in Western Shanghai, which had been widely publicized, was realized at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 17th). The Shanghai Municipal Council's police constables and the "Municipal Police" all withdrew from the road area outside the boundary at that time, and the "Special Police Force" completely took over. There was no commemorative ceremony when the jurisdiction of the Western District was handed over yesterday morning. After the smooth handover, traffic control and other police work were taken over by the "Special Police." "Deputy Chief" Christer published a brief statement yesterday morning, saying that the "Special Police Force" has officially taken over all jurisdiction in the Western District. Once the arrangements are finalized, a formal commemorative ceremony may be held. The "Special Police Headquarters" is located at 57A Great Western Road.

### Belgian Ambassador to China, Baron Guillaume, Will Arrive in Shanghai: Will Stay for Three or Four Days Before Proceeding to Chongqing; Wife, Sons, and Daughters Will Remain in Beijing

Belgian Ambassador to China, Baron Guillaume, has been in Beijing for more than three months since leaving Shanghai in mid-December last year. Because of the extremely cold weather in Beijing, the Ambassador remained at home most of the time, except for handling daily official duties. Now that the earth has revived in spring and the scenery of Jiangnan is especially charming, the Ambassador will depart from Beijing for Shanghai in the coming days, arriving in the city around the 22nd or 23rd. The purpose of this visit is to inspect the embassy affairs and to visit friends. However, the stay in Shanghai will be very brief, only three or four days. The Ambassador will then proceed from Shanghai to Chongqing, as he has been away from Chongqing for a long time and may have become estranged from important figures in the central government. Therefore, he is taking advantage of this bright spring weather to visit Chongqing on a friendly basis, to strengthen the friendly relations between China and Belgium. The length of stay in Chongqing will depend on the complexity of the affairs. It is said that after the Ambassador completes his official duties in Chongqing, he may return to Shanghai for a short stay. However, the Ambassador's wife, sons, and daughters will remain in Beijing and will not accompany the Ambassador.

### Effective Action Should Be Taken to Curb Rice Hoarding: French Authorities Negotiating to Add More Rice Transport Ships

The Shanghai Times reports that the Municipal Council's Food Committee has reportedly formulated appropriate measures to curb rice hoarding and speculation and will submit them to the Municipal Council Board of Directors for discussion at its regular meeting on Wednesday. Given the general public's anxiety about the rice situation, it is expected that the authorities of the Public Concession will cooperate with the French Municipal Council to formulate several effective remedies.

Rumors of Possible Price Increase

It is also rumored that the Rice Evaluation Committee is now planning to increase the official fixed price of rice to effectively deal with black market speculation. It is reported that the committee will meet on the 18th to study this proposed measure. Observers say that since the official fixed price is maintained at the current low level, rice merchants sell rice to customers willing to pay the price they demand, rather than according to the prescribed fixed price, explaining the official price yesterday (the 16th).

French Authorities Expediting Rice Transport

Yesterday (the 16th), the French Concession authorities, to prevent food shortages within the concession, asked Saigon to facilitate the transport of rice already purchased to Shanghai. It is reported that the French authorities have also asked the French shipping company to add more ships to transport rice to Shanghai.

Some Rice Shops Stop Selling Foreign Rice

Currently, some rice shops within the concession refuse to sell foreign rice at the door, causing the common people to suffer even more. When the reporter interviewed a rice shop owner yesterday to inquire about the reason for the suspension of sales, he said that one reason was the lack of rice supply in the rice shops. Another reason was that the underground discounting was so rampant, increasing the cost of purchase. If the transaction exceeds the limit, it would violate previous resolutions and the authorities' prohibitions. If sold at the fixed price, there would be a loss. Therefore, some businesses have temporarily suspended operations and are requesting the rice shop association to submit a request to the concession authorities for clarification. It is also learned that the Rice Shop Association plans to reorder 15,000 bags of foreign rice to be sold on the market and is currently registering.

### Investigation of American Soldier's Murder of Child Confirmed: Child Died of Suffocation

The English-language China Press reports that on the morning of the 13th of this month, the body of an American baby, fifteen months old, was found on the playground of the Jewish School on Seymour Road. Private First Class Keithman of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai was suspected and detained. The U.S. authorities then verified that the baby was killed by Keithman by suffocation. The baby's name was Sebastian Floyd, and his mother, Helen, lived with Keithman at 4 Tai Ping Yang Garden. The U.S. Consular Court will open the trial of this case this morning (the 17th), and the maid hired by Helen and the watchman of the Pacific Garden who discovered the baby's body were summoned to court to provide testimony.

### Large Number of Gamblers Arrested in Ningbo Merchants' Hotel

Yesterday morning, the Old Zha Police Station arrested twenty-six gamblers, including Wu Xigen, in the Ningbo Merchants' Hotel at 496 Tianjin Road. One set of Pai Gow tiles, one shaking cylinder, and over one hundred dollars in cash were confiscated. At 9:20 AM, they were sent to the First Special Court to be prosecuted according to law. After being questioned by Judge Pei, they were sentenced to various penalties to show respect for the law.

### Statistics on Cremated Bodies in the Public Concession Last Year: Total Reached Over 10,000

According to a report from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department, the work of collecting stray corpses and disposing of coffins is still carried out in cooperation with the Shanghai Pushan Cemetery and with the assistance of various parties, so the progress is quite smooth. Last year, a total of 20,209 bodies were cremated, slightly less than the previous year. A total of 9,244 coffins were buried, and 13,728 coffins were transported back to their hometowns. As of the end of the year, a total of 40,897 coffins were stored in various coffin storage facilities, funeral homes, and guild halls, an increase of 11,602 compared to the previous year. Personnel are dispatched to inspect the coffin storage facilities from time to time.

### New Postage Rates and Weight Limits for Parcels

Candidates who pass the oral examinations will be formally admitted. The number of candidates admitted will depend on the results of the oral examinations. Based on past experience, all candidates who pass the written test have a hope of being admitted. The number of candidates admitted this time has increased compared to previous years and will be assigned to various post offices in the postal districts of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. Some will remain to work at the Shanghai Post Office, while others will be employed when vacancies become available.

### Sailboat Crossing of the Pacific Ocean Completed

Mr. Shifo, a former employee of the American President Lines, and a party of six people set sail from Shanghai on the 10th of this month aboard their own twin-masted sailboat, the "Planet" (25 tons, 46 feet long), with the intention of making a heroic crossing of the Pacific Ocean. However, when they sailed to the mouth of the Huangpu River that day, they were unable to proceed due to the adverse weather. In the evening, the sailboat was slightly damaged due to the wind and waves, so they had to stop and repair it at Songkou. It is now reported that the sailboat has been repaired in recent days. Mr. and Mrs. Shifo and the other four companions are still determined to make the heroic crossing of the Pacific Ocean to return home. They loaded six months' worth of food and set sail from the Wusong pier yesterday morning, expecting to arrive in Honolulu within three weeks.

### Neon Signs in the French Concession to Be Turned Off Completely Next Week

Mr. Favrel, the manager of the French Water and Electricity Company, told reporters yesterday that he hopes that the neon signs on the streets of the French Concession will be turned off completely by next week. Mr. Favrel said that the new regulations promulgated by the French authorities last Saturday stipulated that neon lights and other advertising lights should be turned off immediately, but in fact, this cannot be achieved without considerable time. He also said that "small" "neon lights are still allowed to be used. The company will send out several personnel within the week to notify various stores and institutions of the amount of electricity they can use.

### Old, Sick, and Addicted to Opium: Thugs Break In and Extort Money, Stealing Opium Pipe and Ransom Money: One Woman Arrested, Two Robbers Escape

Li Huizhang, a Cantonese man, is 72 years old. He used to work as a dyer at the Municipal Council, but he retired due to old age and illness. He lives at No. 105, Lane 546, Tiantong Road. He is deeply addicted to opium and spends his days lying in bed, smoking. A Cantonese woman named Huang Zhangshi, because she and Li are from the same hometown, often visits Li's home and occasionally helps Li prepare opium. At around 2:00 PM on the 11th of this month, two men he did not know, Chen Xuelin and Huang Lianghua, suddenly broke into Li's home and took away an opium pipe, instructing him to redeem it for 100 yuan at the Haining Village Tea House on Quanhai Ning Road. Li reported the incident to the Wusih Police Station and requested an investigation. The day before yesterday, Huang Zhangshi brought Cai Wang and two others to Li's residence and demanded 60 yuan. Li reported the incident to the police station again. Detective Hu Guangrong and Yang Jinchen were dispatched to arrest her. Cai Wang and two others escaped. They were taken to the police station, where it was learned that the opium pipe had been pawned at the Jinan Pawnshop at 517 Haining Road for 22 yuan. The opium pipe was then redeemed.

### Food: Raising a Tiger Can Be a Threat: Hoarders Refuse to Display Samples: Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai in a Steady Stream, with Another 40,000+ Bags; Not Enough to Stir Hoarders, Daring to Intend Coercion

Hopes for a clarification of the increasingly deteriorating atmosphere surrounding foreign rice rose at the end of last week. Shanghai has a lot of foreign rice, enough to feed millions of citizens for more than half a year. How could there be any fear of shortages? The sources are coming in an endless stream. Seventy or eighty thousand bags that had arrived were already being unloaded, and two or three more ships were newly arrived waiting to be unloaded. The market price should be small or not small, is this not an obvious phenomenon of monopoly manipulation? The morning market yesterday was still stable, but then large households, dealing with the bureau's accusations, did not go to the market to display samples, and did not even display samples outside the market. Many floating households then hoarded and raised prices, and the market immediately became tense again. Xiaowen rice, which was traded the most, was pulled up by two, three, or four yuan. Saigon broken rice was also taken up. Xiaojiao's initial price was 3,300 to 3,400 yuan per hundred bags, followed by as much as 3,700 yuan. The premium for No. 1 Neigong was 2,900 yuan and 3,000 yuan, and the premium for No. 2 was 3,300 to 3,400 yuan. No. 1 Saigon's original package was 108 and a half yuan, broken rice was 85 yuan per shi, and second-grade was 80 yuan. However, new transactions included Laogongmao selling 200 tons of No. 1 Saigon road goods at a price of 120 yuan per bag, and Heyi Foreign Bank selling 3,300 tons of Xiaojiao for delivery in late April and early May at a price of 126 yuan per bag. There are currently eight or nine thousand bags of foreign rice, both in bulk and packaged. With such behavior, the rice hoarders are trying to use the trick of controlling food. Allowing them to hoard shows that raising a tiger can be a threat, reaping what you sow.

The arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai is very strong. The French ship G.G.A.Varenne, managed by Hualun Foreign Bank, arrived in Shanghai directly from Saigon with 30,500+ bags of foreign rice, according to the scheduled shipping date, on the 16th (Sunday), and docked at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong to unload. On the same day, Taikoo Company's Jinan ship arrived from Hong Kong with 2,168 bags, docking at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession to unload. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship also arrived in port on the 16th, also bringing 8,118 bags from Hong Kong, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. (Zu)

After the thick and thin japonica and other national rice varieties returned to fatigue the week before, they were even more exhausted yesterday due to the relatively large number of sources. Not only was the guest's acceptance not good, but the general owners' willingness to sell also loosened, so the price continued to be difficult to stand, and the depreciation continued by two or three yuan. For example, Changbang Hubei japonica opened at 126 yuan to 124 yuan, Kunshan Hubei japonica at 122 or 3 yuan to 120 yuan, and Qingjiao Hubei thin rice at 117 yuan, eventually dropping to 115 and a half yuan.

Because both buyers and sellers were wary of the black market rumors of foreign rice at this time, fearing that drastic changes would suddenly arise, and the subsequent impact was difficult to predict, both did not dare to venture in and out, so there were few transactions and the market price did not change. Similar to before, Hong Kong Baiyuan special grade still opened at 108 yuan, eventually settling at 104 yuan, and glutinous tea was at 98 yuan and 97 yuan and a half.

### Tapioca Flour Begins to Calm Down

The tapioca flour market has entered a calm phase. The tapioca flour transshipped from Hong Kong is shipped to Shanghai in a steady stream, and Kanmei flour is repeatedly scheduled to open, making it difficult to boost people's spirits. The actual sales in this street are still supplied by Fuxin Factory with more than 5,000 bags of medium-selling flour, with no additional needs. Therefore, both local and foreign transactions have become flat, and the unified market price for selling Kaifeng Bird Tower brand is 32 yuan, 5 jiao to 5 jiao and a half, Jinlong brand is 31 yuan and 5 jiao, slightly higher than the end of last week.

The wheat market is still quiet. The source of inland Dumai wheat has been cut off. The foreign wheat that has arrived is being supplied by Fuxin Factory for flour production at a fair price. Fufeng Factory has stopped due to lack of wheat, so the Chinese factory has no business at all, and there is no cargo to buy at the Japanese factory store. The market is still at a standstill.

### Oil Cake: Futures Oil Falls Back Two Yuan

Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains, oil, bean cakes, and etc. did not undergo much special change. However, because the spot market for futures soybean oil was bleak, many people in the industry were bearish, so the company organization sold with all its strength, and the interest in suppressing the market was quite strong. However, the activity of non-industry hoarders and buck-passing retail investors was quite strong, so even though there were several falls, they were forcibly recovered. The market was slightly quieter yesterday, and as a result, it was about two yuan less than the end of last week. Spot prices still have a slight difference. A total of 100 dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil was traded, with a price of 100 yuan. There were 200 barrels of Dalian spot oil, with a price of 134 yuan to 33 yuan and 5 jiao, and 600 barrels for delivery in early April, with the price falling from 137 yuan and 5 jiao to 135 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen. Today, there were 240 bags of exported soybeans, 200 bags of peanuts, 100 bags of sesame, and 200 cans of sesame oil, all shipped to Hong Kong, and 50 bags of soybeans shipped to Haikou.

### Finance: More Import Bills Settled: Exchange Rates for British and American Currencies Continue to Be Tight

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's official rate was announced at 9:30 AM: British exchange rate was 3 pence 25, American exchange rate was 5 yuan 315, both reduced by 0.0625. There was no market for French or German currencies, and other exchange rates also decreased. The underground market for British and American exchange rates also softened due to the import rush. The tightest British gold this month only settled at 3 pence 296875, and the American exchange rate sold for 5 yuan 375. Until noon, speculators stopped the rush to buy, and the American dollar this month once sold as high as 5 yuan 4375. Although speculators sold in the afternoon, the rush to buy for imports was even better, and the potential softened again. Ultimately, British gold was at 3 pence 296875, and American dollar at 5 yuan 375, both tightly at 0.03125. Transactions were quite brisk.

HSBC Official Rate Also Decreases

Since the Central Official Rate this morning did not change, foreign telegraph prices for British and American currencies had no changes, and Indian silver was flat for both spot and long-term futures. The exchange rates of various countries for the American dollar were 2 cents lower for Shanghai, and the rest were flat. The opening price of silver in the domestic market was for the selling price. The spot prices were British gold at 3 pence 328125, American dollar at 5 yuan 40625, and the Russian exchange rate softened to 3 pence 3125 for British gold in March and 5 yuan 40625 for American dollar this month, all bank buying prices. The hanging price of exchange rates also decreased, and the silver balance tax was still slightly at 24.50%. Later, it was suddenly heard that an importer came to rush to settle the March British gold at only 3 pence 3125, and speculators came to rush for the April American dollar at 5 yuan 40625 and 5 yuan 375. By 10:45, foreign banks suddenly offered better terms, and speculators also turned to selling, with this month's American dollar actually reaching 5 yuan 4375, turning firmer. The noon closing prices were British gold at 3 pence 3125 and American dollar at 5 yuan 40625.

Foreign Banks Continuously Absorb

In the afternoon market, the foreign banks initially absorbed the March American exchange rate again at 5 yuan 40625 due to speculators continuing to release it. Later, the market softened again because foreign banks started to absorb settlements again. The March and April American exchange rates were priced at 5 yuan 375 and 40625, and it was difficult to supply them. The evening closing prices for spot and near- and long-term futures were British exchange rate at 3 pence 296875 and American exchange rate at 5 yuan 375, both reduced by 0.03125 compared to the closing prices on Saturday.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises

At 2:30 PM, the market was flat. All exchange rates had no changes.

### Economic Discussions on Tea (Continued)

— Feng Liutang

The so-called "one spear, one flag" or "one spear, two flags" is the origin of the names "flag spear" used by tea shops today. The *Beiyuan Bielu* by an anonymous Song Dynasty author provides a more detailed explanation than the previous one, stating:

"Tea has small buds, medium buds, purple buds, white-combined buds, and black-stemmed buds, which must be distinguished. The small buds, like eagle claws, are used to make the finest Dragon Ball and Snow White teas. These buds are picked first, steamed, and placed in a water basin, where their essence is extracted, as small as needles, and called 'water buds,' the finest of the small buds. Medium buds are what the ancients called 'one spear, one flag.' Purple buds are buds that are purple. White-combined buds are small buds with two leaves that grow embracing each other. Black stems are the stems of the leaves. Of all teas, water buds are the best, followed by small buds, then medium buds. Purple buds, white-combined buds, and black stems are not desired. If they are carefully selected, the color and flavor of the tea will be excellent. If any of the undesirable parts are mixed in, the quality will be uneven, the color will be muddy, and the taste will be heavy."

During the Song Dynasty, tribute tea was molded with silver molds, engraved with dragon patterns, similar to today's tea bricks. Song people also believed that the reason Longjing tea was so good was that it was moistened by the Longjing spring water. Tea leaves grow best in mountains with mild climates and humid air, with wild tea being the most prized. Therefore, mountains with frequent clouds and mists produce excellent tea. Tea is produced in Fujian, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, but because tea farmers do not pay attention to tea-making techniques, and tea merchants are greedy for quick profits and mix in coloring, foreigners have transplanted tea to Ceylon and Taiwan. However, although the picking and processing are exquisite, the timing and geographical advantages cannot be changed, so the color, aroma, and flavor of Chinese tea are still the best. The reason why Chinese tea has not disappeared from the world market is that it is uniquely blessed by nature. However, if we rely on this advantage and become complacent, without striving for improvement, then even the best products will eventually be destroyed. Should we not be afraid of this?

It is said that Biluochun tea, produced in Dongting East Mountain in Tai Lake, was originally called "Scare the Person to Death." It is said that village girls picking tea would pluck the buds and place them in their bosom. The tea buds, warmed by the chest, would suddenly emit an unusual fragrance, startling the tea girl, who would exclaim, "Scare the Person to Death!" "Scare the Person to Death" is a term of surprise in the Wu dialect. During the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty, when he made a southern tour to Suzhou, the governor of Suzhou at the time, Song Luo, accompanied the emperor on a tour of Tai Lake. He saw fishermen catching fish and also caught a large fish with their nets, which pleased him greatly. When they ascended Dong Mountain, they offered tea. He drank it and found it sweet. He asked what kind of tea it was, and they replied, "Scare the Person to Death." The emperor, finding the name unpleasant, named it Biluochun. This is another small anecdote in the history of tea.

Books discussing tea, from the Tang and Song dynasties onwards, all contain records. Recent people have written even more books, so I will not go into detail here. In Shanghai, when drinking green tea, people often say "Longjing," but in fact, the real Longjing tea is not even enough for the monks to give as gifts to guests. How could there be any leftover tea for the market? Therefore, most of the tea circulating in the market is remanufactured! When Shanghai became an isolated island, the tea leaves in the occupied areas were all seized by the Japanese. Even if merchants had permits, they would return empty-handed after delivering the goods to Shanghai. The tea leaves in the free areas were controlled by the government, and the coastal ports were blocked by the Japanese, so tea had to be shipped from Hong Kong, making it not only scarce but also expensive. The tea sold in the market was not the real thing, and the quality was also poor. To meet market demand, tea merchants had to remanufacture miscellaneous teas. In the process of remanufacturing, they sometimes used white wax to increase the luster, or even used candle oil, to give it a sheen. Therefore, sometimes when drinking tea, one would notice a greasy taste, initially thinking it was due to the unclean water from the public water boilers. However, when brewing tea with one's own water, the oily and unpleasant taste remained, and one realized that it was a problem with the tea itself. Sometimes, tea water would turn a brownish-green color overnight, which was due to excessive coloring of the tea leaves. Why is tea leaf colored? Originally, it was for aesthetic reasons in the market, to make it look green and appealing. It is said that tea leaf coloring was accidentally discovered by the late tea merchant Zhu Bao. During the Guangxu reign, the No. 1 warehouse of a certain bank caught fire, and the tea stored in the warehouse was flooded with water, resulting in some blackening. Zhu had tea stored there, so he ordered the warehouse staff to buy white powder to decorate the tea. The warehouse staff mistakenly bought yellow powder and mixed it with the tea leaves, making the tea color even more beautiful. As a result, the tea was very popular. People in the industry were surprised, and the warehouse staff revealed the secret, so everyone followed suit. However, excessive coloring, resulting in tea that was too yellow or too green, caused public suspicion, and the practice of coloring tea was banned when the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau was established. The tea inspection was entrusted to Wu Juenong, who studied agriculture and took it upon himself to improve tea production. He usually did a lot of research and considered banning yellow powder, but a coloring agent was still necessary. Therefore, he sought out non-toxic yellow powders, but although some products were eventually produced, they turned green after prolonged use in tea, so they were not entirely satisfactory.

The custom of drinking tea is most prevalent in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, said to have flourished in the early Qing Dynasty. However, reading Nai Deweng's *Guhang Mengyoulu* from the Southern Song Dynasty, we know that it was already prevalent at that time.

"Large teahouses hang paintings and calligraphy by famous artists. In the capital, only hot food restaurants hang paintings, to help customers pass the time. Now all teahouses do the same. There are also places where people from various trades gather to play games, called 'market heads.'"

The "market head" is the origin of today's "tea gatherings" of various trades.

The black tea sold in the market now is even worse, as it is even more difficult to get black tea to Shanghai. Therefore, some people remanufacture green tea in Shanghai, and then add a little Taiwanese black tea on top to deceive customers. When brewed, the tea soup has a weak flavor, and the tea leaves are neither red nor green, because black tea must be made from fresh leaves. Remanufacturing green tea turns it into "red-trimmed" tea. (In small tea houses in the countryside, red and green tea are sometimes mixed together and called "red-trimmed.") (The End)

Tianjin's British and American Currencies Are Tight

Tianjin, 17th (Weekly) Dispatch: The foreign exchange market opened tight this morning. London telegraphic transfers were down to 0.625, a decrease of 3 pence and 625 points. New York telegraphic transfers were reduced to 115, or 5.9375 yuan. Shanghai exchange rates rose 50 cents, to 90.05 yuan. "United Notes" remained stable in the unofficial market, still at 75 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Rise Still Slight

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw fluctuating spot prices. British and American gold pounds fell and then recovered. British gold notes had slight demand, and spot prices rose slightly. The American dollar once rose to 18.435 yuan, a rise of 10 cents from Saturday. Hong Kong notes rose by 2 cents following the rise in the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. Japanese and Korean gold notes continued to rise, with spot prices continuing to climb, the former rising to 1.944 yuan and the latter rising to 1.60 yuan.

### Gold Prices Rise, But Slowly

Yesterday's gold market in both the spot and unofficial markets shrunk due to the soft foreign exchange rates settled by foreign firms. Most people were bullish, but one large player took profits at a high point, causing the price to fluctuate despite rising again. Xinhua, a Hong Kong and Taiwan exchange dealer, sold short, pushing the price down to 6,398 yuan. However, this was fleeting, and the price quickly rebounded. Banks and securities firms absorbed the supply, and retail investors pushed the price up to 6,458 yuan due to tight foreign exchange conditions. At noon, the price rose with the US dollar, recovering more than 50 yuan. In the afternoon, exchange dealers bought back, and securities firms absorbed the military's selling pressure, pushing the price up to around 6,430 yuan. In the end, the price rose another 6 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was over 20,000 taels. The three-month rollover from March to April saw sellers like Xiangxing, Yongli, Tai, and Wanfeng offer 300 taels to buyers like Chengji at prices of 40 yuan and 38 yuan. Cash was initially flat. In the morning, Tianyuan and Yida each offered 50 taels to Tiancheng, and then Tianyuan offered another 400 taels, while Shihe offered 30 taels, all of which were bought by Jundefu at a price 350 yuan higher than the futures price. In the afternoon, Chengda sold 20 taels to Wengyuan at 315 yuan higher, and then sellers offered at 310 yuan higher, with buyers bidding as high as 290 yuan higher. Ornament gold and customs gold were both flat.

Taking Profits at High Prices

The market opened this morning at 5:15 am at 6,320 yuan per bar (ten pieces), 5 yuan lower. Chengji and Yida aggressively bought, pushing the price up to 6,445 yuan. Xinfeng and Yongshunyuan sold, causing an immediate drop. Around 10 o'clock, Dafeng, Defu, and retail investors also sold, causing a sharper decline, breaking below 6,400 yuan. Tianyuan also sold, dropping the price to 6,398 yuan, which was absorbed by Hengji, Yida, and Tiancheng money shops. Retail investors covered their short positions, pushing the price up by 60 yuan. The price then soared to 6,458 yuan on rumors that the April US dollar rate was only 5.375. Around 11 o'clock, securities firms, Defu, and exchange dealers sold, and the US dollar strengthened, causing retail investors to rush to sell, pulling the price back to around 6,410 yuan. The noon close was 7,410 yuan. The afternoon session opened at 6,420 yuan, 10 yuan higher than the noon close. The price then retreated slightly to 6,410 yuan. Xiangxing, Yongtong, Kangyong, and Laijin bought, and the exchange dealers Xinfeng and Yongtao bought back, causing a rise of 30 yuan to 6,440 yuan. Ultimately, Chengji, a gold shop, sold aggressively, causing a decline to 6,425 yuan. The closing price at 4 o'clock was 6,431 yuan, 6 yuan higher than Saturday's noon close. Based on the April US dollar futures price of 5.375, the implied price was 6,479.1 yuan, a discount of 48.1 yuan. After the close, the price rose to 6,440 yuan. The selling price of cash gold at the main brand gold shops was 310 yuan higher than the spot futures price, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for spot gold.

Ornament Gold Still Unchanged

The selling price of gold ornaments per tael at Yinlou Jewelry remained at 690 yuan at Datongxing and Xintongxing (buying price minus 40 yuan), it is said.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds See Stronger Gains

The unofficial market for government bonds saw strong upward momentum yesterday. A large player suddenly took profits in the afternoon, causing a slight pullback, but the final result was still higher than the previous week. Since the return of Special Envoy Corlett to the United States, prospects for aid to China seem increasingly uncertain, so although large players sold government bonds, the market price did not fall much, indicating that most buyers are investors. The current spot market is extremely tight, and it is not easy to force the market down, even under pressure. Yesterday's trading saw many purchases in the morning, with Category C bonds breaking through 6 yuan. Xiexingyuan, Zhongyi, Hu Heji, Hengkang, Datong, and Xinhua all absorbed a large amount. Although Jiufu, Xieda, Yichang, and Lianhe sold, the market price gradually rose, with Category C closing at the highest price of 6.65 yuan. In the afternoon, Lianhe suddenly bought a large amount, as much as 700,000 or 800,000 yuan. Xiexingyuan, Lianyi, Shunchang, and Renchang also showed considerable interest. The high price of Category C was close to 7 yuan, but Hongda, Tongkang, Jiufeng, Datong, and Xiekang sold off, pushing the market down by 400 cents. The results, except for a slight decrease of 15 cents for Category D, all rose by 50 to 80 cents. The total volume traded was around 2.4 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day
---|---|---|---|---

Stock trading: 100 shares of Zhongyi Trust were traded at a price of 15.5 yuan, and 100 shares of Huashang Electric were traded at a price of 7.85 yuan.

Also, the stock market at the Public Industry Association was remarkably strong throughout the day due to generally good news and optimistic sentiment. Jardine Matheson rose to the original price before the dividend was paid at the close of last week. Union Insurance and Jardine Matheson also rose sharply. Industrial stocks saw a huge volume of transactions, and most rubber stocks also rose.

### Yarn and Cotton: Short Positions Increase, Cotton Yarn Fails to Rise

The yarn market initially rose and then fell, and the situation returned to a state of flux. Although there were no large-scale developments in actual transactions by Hong Kong firms, there was a steady stream of small purchases, so sentiment remained calm. On the bullish side, due to the shrinking foreign exchange rates and rising spot gold prices, the yarn market should have risen. However, because short sellers had abundant inventory and limited sea transport, the short positions of securities firms were rolled over day by day, and the upward momentum was suppressed. The high price for 20-count Bianma yarn was 1,432 yuan, and the low price was 1,410 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was 1,408 yuan. The price rose to 1,416 yuan on rumors that gold prices were still high, and finally closed at 1,415 yuan. Today, 235 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Shuangma opened this morning continuing the strong gains of the previous day, with the opening price at 1,430 yuan. Shortly after, it rose slightly to 1,432 yuan. Then, there were few buyers on the trading floor, and the short sellers not only did not cover but even increased their positions. This caused the market to decline to 1,411 yuan. However, foreign exchange rates opened lower, and spot gold prices rose, causing sentiment to recover to 1,422 yuan. This price level was maintained for a short time, but the buying interest did not surge. The price then fell again to close at 1,411 yuan as gold prices eased slightly. According to the half-day trading statistics, 6,675 bales were traded. The amount of purchases by each firm is listed below:

Hong Kong: 670 | Mainland: 5
---|---|---
Other Firms: 6,000 | Total: 6,675

### Fine Lint Cotton is Popular

The current cotton situation is also stable. Factories have a slight need, but 42-count raw materials are still the most popular, while others are mediocre, it is said. The New York cotton market was initially strong due to foreign purchases and good cotton fabric sales, but then fell back due to some profit-taking. As a result, the closing price was up or down 2-3 points compared to the previous day.

### A Visit to the Shanghai Drama School

— Li Da

In the early Republic of China, Zhang Jian of Nantong founded the Linggong School, hiring Ouyang Yuqian to preside over it. This was the beginning of the educational reform of opera troupes. Unfortunately, it dissolved after only a few years. The Shandong Opera School was run by Wang Bosheng, and Han Fuju donated 70,000 yuan before the war, but the school did not achieve any special results in its three years of operation and was therefore closed. There was also the Peking Drama School, originally run by Jiao Juying and his wife, with Cheng Yanqiu as the chairman of the board. Before the war, the Peking Municipal Government subsidized it with 2,000 yuan per month, but this was stopped after the war, making it impossible to maintain. It is said that it has been taken over and is continuing to operate, which shows that it is not an easy task.

Although the Shanghai Drama School has only been open for a little over a year, its students have already given 59 public performances, and are able to perform 52 different operas. People in Shanghai have a considerable impression of it. Although I am a complete outsider to Peking opera, I attach great importance to these little angels who are learning drama. I have long wanted to explore the training methods of these future artists. Perhaps some of them will become famous actors one day. Therefore, it is worth visiting the school to see what is going on behind the scenes. I took time out of my busy schedule to visit.

The school was founded on December 7, 1931. The school building was originally the old site of the Diaochan Tea Room on Rue Massenet, which is not very large. Therefore, there are only two classrooms, one upstairs and one downstairs. Although the facilities are simple, the teachers are dedicated and the students are focused, exuding a serious and pleasant spirit. This is admirable. The school's practical courses are divided into male roles, female roles, painted-face roles, male roles, comic roles, martial roles, stage equipment, music, costumes, etc. However, all students must be called to roll call at 6:45 every morning. From 7:00 to 8:40, male students practice martial arts, as martial arts are a required course for male students. The students are between the ages of eight and fifteen, which is equivalent to elementary school age, and they are already practicing martial arts.

I then saw that the students of the school were all full of energy, lively and likeable. They are all interested in their studies, so they all rush to perform in public performances. Like newborn calves unafraid of tigers, they do not care about difficulty, success, or failure, and go forward bravely, mainly to satisfy their desire to perform. This is also a different phenomenon from other schools.

The school's academic subjects include Chinese, English, mathematics, history, geography, general knowledge, civics, and dramatic theory. Because of the emphasis on practical courses, the class time is less than that of practical courses. Judging from the daily training methods and the results of dozens of public performances, it can be said that it is already an art school of considerable scale. Society has a poor impression of traditional opera troupes, but the opera troupes of recent years are not as terrible as people say. Moreover, the school is not comparable to an opera troupe. However, the teaching method in the school is more burdensome than in ordinary schools. Both teachers and students must be hardworking. The rumors about corporal punishment may be the result of misunderstandings and conjectures. In fact, if you ask any of the teachers, they all say that it is absolutely untrue. The students in the school are disciplined, willing to obey, orderly, polite, focused on their studies, and able to endure hardship, so there is no need for corporal punishment.

Among the students of the school, there is no shortage of excellent talents. For example, the male role Guan Zhengming, the female role Gu Zhengqiu, the painted-face role Zhang Zhengpeng, the copper hammer Xu Zhengjun, the young male role Xue Zhengkang (from Guangdong, whose parents are middle school teachers), the old female role Zhu Zhengqin, the martial female role Ma Zhengfeng, the ingenue role Zhang Zhengfang, the martial male role Wang Zhengkun, the comic role Sun Zhengyang, and the martial comic role Jing Zhengfei are all outstanding talents. The operas that have already been performed at the Golden Grand Theatre include *Fourth Son Visits His Mother*, *Zhong Kui Marries His Sister*, *Red Mane Stallion*, *Ti Ying Saves Her Father*, and *Lin Chong Flees at Night*. The school's directors are Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xiaochu, Wei Tingrong, and Bao Heqing. The principal, Chen Chengyin, graduated from Soochow University and practices law in Shanghai. The Director of General Affairs, Yu Yunggu, graduated from Aurora University and is a famous opera fan who is famous for specializing in the red-face role. The Director of Practical Affairs, Guan Hongbin, was a teacher at the Chinese Cultural Drama Troupe and went to the United States to perform. Ruidebao, Wang Yifang, Mu Shenglou, and Guan Shengming are respectively responsible for teaching, and are all famous Peking opera teachers.

However, since the establishment of the school, 130,000 yuan have been spent in 15 months, and it is currently in debt for 70,000 yuan, so the facilities are not as satisfactory as they could be. The only goal is to improve Peking opera and train new actors who meet the requirements. There is no shortage of people in the world who advocate art education, so how to cherish it goes without saying.

### French Concession Issues Statement Temporarily Banning Football Matches

Following the unfortunate events that occurred at the East China-West Precinct Grade A final at the Recreation Ground last Saturday, the French Concession authorities have decided to temporarily ban all football matches in the concession. The French Concession authorities issued the following statement yesterday:

The French Concession authorities have now decided to temporarily ban all football matches in the concession, as such matches have recently provoked unfortunate incidents that have disrupted public order. The police authorities have had to come forward to suppress them in order to maintain the safety of the concession and its residents. The necessary measures taken when the previous dispute occurred restored order and prevented a serious tragedy. However, such disputes easily lead to misunderstandings between residents and the police, which the authorities do not wish to hear of. Therefore, it is considered necessary to temporarily ban sports gatherings.

### "Side Business"

— Cheng Jun

On the anniversary of the death of the Premier, schools are closed as usual, which is an extra holiday for those of us who make a living by eating chalk dust. In theory, we should express our sorrow on this day; but who knows how many people are seeking pleasure in cinemas and entertainment venues!

I am a pauper. Because I am forced by life, I teach Chinese in two middle schools, which often causes my desk to be covered in piles of books and papers, and there is no time to clean it up. This should be a good opportunity. I finished grading one hundred and fifty books on Sunday, and then I had another holiday the next day. So I decided to clear them all out completely, so that I could have a breather during the week. So I ate some snacks early in the morning and immediately started working, and I actually finished grading the remaining one hundred books, and it was only two o'clock! This really made me overjoyed. I was secretly pleased that my blitzkrieg had completed the work that would have taken a week to complete.

At this time, I felt as if a burden of several hundred pounds had been lifted from my body. I felt infinitely happy. With light steps, I strode to the house of a small school principal in one breath. In addition to wanting to inquire about news from my hometown, I also wanted to discuss the future of China's recent political turmoil.

But everything was beyond my expectations. When I stepped into his office, the first question he asked me was what side business I had been doing recently? This question made me stunned. What side business could a teacher do? I was stunned for a while, and then I seemed to understand. I said very proudly, "I just write some manuscripts." "Oh, writing manuscripts is so hard, it's a brain-racking job, and a manuscript can't be exchanged for much money." I heard a knowing smile, because there were friends who could pity my life! But I finally sighed to him: "I can't do any other side business besides writing manuscripts." He heard my sigh and rocked his chair as if he had something else in mind, while taking out a cigarette and smoking. And me? Waiting for him to tell me about a labor-saving side business.

"Recently, prices have soared. You can make money by hoarding any goods. Look, I have hoarded 3,000 yuan of goods here, and now it's worth 1,500 yuan." He pointed to the goods piled up in the room while fiddling with the abacus. He really had a kind of dancing and foot-stomping demeanor, and his face was covered with the smiling face of a merchant.

He wouldn't have said anything if he hadn't said it. Once he said it, I couldn't help but make a note of the pilgrimage, and carefully looked at his small office. Cigarettes, soap, matches, kerosene, beer, and all other kinds of goods from north and south were available. It was simply like a warehouse. Only then did I understand; what he just said about a side business turned out to be hoarding for profit. I am now talking to a merchant. How can I interject on political and social issues? I had no choice but to dismiss my original intention of visiting and listen to the lecture on hoarding for profit.

I had a bitter smile on my face, perhaps a contemptuous sneer. I said to him: "Only someone like you, brother, has the capital to hoard goods! If I had so much spare money to hoard goods, to be honest, I wouldn't bury myself in the desk and rack my brains to write manuscripts. Now, I don't even have time to save the dying and keep myself alive. Hoarding goods to get rich is not only a stranger to me, but also something I don't want to do. Because I am now eating 125 yuan worth of rice!" I felt very happy to say it. I hurriedly left him.

Hoarding for profit can be regarded as a side business. I wonder if stealing, robbing, betraying the country for glory, and extorting can also be regarded as side businesses?

### Mother's Fate

— Qiu Sheng

I respect my father very much, and I respect my mother even more. Sometimes I hate my father because I love my mother, because he created my mother's bad fate.

As early as the summer of sixteen years ago, I began to hear people say: My father loves to smoke opium. Although I was only twelve years old at the time, I already knew the harm of smoking opium: it not only damaged my father's health, but also could ruin my family's happiness and my future, so I was very sad.

My mother's face, which was usually full of laughter, disappeared because of my father's depravity. She sometimes sighed alone, sometimes cried to my father, and sometimes I shed a lot of hot tears along with my mother's crying.

In the spring of another year, my mother and I lived with my maternal grandmother. One warm afternoon, the sun shone all over the earth, butterflies flew and birds sang, and the universe was full of vitality. Although my mother was still young at that time, she seemed to have no vitality; for some reason, she talked about my father again, and my mother was crying in a corner again, and my maternal grandmother was also sighing beside her: "This is also your fate!... It also takes luck to marry a good husband!" This is like acting in a play, but the plot is too tragic, and I was moved to tears again. "Child! I only hope for you now!" My mother said intermittently. "But this hope is still far away, and I'm afraid your fate will not be able to escape following your father!" My mother's only hope was shaken again. "Mom!" I couldn't say anything, and my eyes suddenly became blurred.

It has been sixteen years since then, and my mother has suffered for sixteen years. According to my maternal grandmother, this is "mother's fate." My mother herself admitted that this is "fate," but she believes that this is the current "fate," and "fate" will change with time, and her future "fate" needs to be created by her later generations. So she believes that her future "fate" will shift with my "fate."

My mother attributed her whole life to "fate." She divided her "fate" into three periods and divided them into the bodies of people in three eras.

I don't know much about the first period of my mother's "fate," but according to my mother herself, because she is a girl, girls are always "people from other families," so she can't get the love of her parents; but under the protection of her parents, she lived a life that was better than a maid for eleven years. Although my mother was born into a wealthy family and her uncle was a university graduate, my mother only received two years of private school education.

According to my maternal grandmother, my mother's second period of "fate" was troubled for more than ten years because she "did not have the blessing to marry a good husband."

My mother's third period of "fate" has begun from now on, and she is now yearning for the arrival of good fortune.

Mom! You have suffered all your life! You believe in "fate" too much!

### Life

— Wen Ya

Life is a kind of consciousness, and consciousness is constantly changing, constantly advancing, just like time moving forward day and night. Since consciousness is constantly changing and constantly advancing, then our life is also constantly changing and constantly advancing: so life is evolving. And this evolution is gradually increasing and gradually creating along with the changing progress. Therefore, life is creative evolution—Bergson said.

(5) The Division Between Love and Desire

"If you hurt someone, I'm afraid it won't be so easy to let him out!" He held an empty teapot and walked out slowly, deliberately saying this in a voice that was not too loud or too low, wanting Qiu Haitang to hear it. He knew very well that this boss would never lose his temper with him. Qiu Haitang's temper towards his subordinates was certainly very good, but at this time, his lack of calculation with Rong Kui had another reason, and that was that he was too happy in his heart!

A woman who is so dignified and beautiful, and who has sufficient knowledge and noble character, has walked into his life's realm like a dream. The comfort that anyone could ask for has unexpectedly descended on the head of an actor. How could he not be happy about such an encounter? Now, even if Shen Ma Pi's men hold all his belongings together, or even lock him up in the police station like Zhao Yukun, he is satisfied in his heart, and he can also swear to them that he will never hate them, but will thank them; he will never forget that he was able to meet Luo Xiangqi in such a favorable situation, entirely because of their gift!

In fact, Luo Xiangqi not only did not reveal such a warm expression as Wang Treasurer's daughter-in-law did when they met, but also did not say a word to directly vent her feelings; if Qiu Haitang's feelings were not particularly sensitive, he would not know that she had developed feelings for herself beyond the ordinary. However, Qiu Haitang not only already knew, but also believed that as long as he moved forward in that direction, the kind of comfort he had been looking forward to for several years would surely be obtained.

Yuan Baofan's long and large figure and Zhao Yukun's late return also delayed his original plan for a few hours, but after the people in the hotel were completely asleep, he finally picked up his pen and lay on a small table, spreading out a very elaborate foreign paper letter that Zhao Si had bought for him, and decided to write the letter he wanted.

### A Record of Directing in a Dream

— Qin Shiwu

I had a dream last night, and I was actually promoted to director. I can't not record it. It seems that I am already sitting on the set. The script is "A Dream of Fifty Years of Prosperity at Sea," which was given to me by the manager, saying that it was written by a senior writer. The set is an old-fashioned brothel, according to the script, it is Zhang Shuyu, one of the Four Heavenly Kings. That day, we were filming the Shanghai Daotai hosting a banquet in the courtyard. The Shanghai Daotai suddenly had a whim and wanted to borrow Zhang Shuyu's green sedan chair to take a ride around Fourth Horse Road, so there were a lot of jokes. I read the script carefully and admired the "insight" of this senior writer very much, because the themes of costume dramas have already been snatched up by others, and I have just been promoted to director, so if there is no good script, it will have a great impact on my reputation and future position in the film industry. Fortunately, I took the "inside line" and the manager gave me this good script; when it comes out in the future, haha, am I not a great director?

But the one who plays Zhang Shuyu is the company's "top star," and she seems to look down on me. The "romantic young man" who plays the Shanghai Daotai and the extras are all here, but her whereabouts are still unknown. Later, the stage manager secretly told me that as long as I do this and that, I will be successful. Sure enough, I made a phone call and did this and that, and in a few minutes, the sound of her car horn was already ringing outside the door.

The cameraman is an old friend. I secretly paid him a "bribe" in advance, such as close-ups, long shots, special effects, etc., so that he wouldn't have to hug Buddha's feet at the last minute and ask for trouble. After the top lights were turned on, it was actually brightly lit. While Zhang Shuyu was putting on makeup, I first filmed a joke about turtles and set builders—this was not in the script, because I wanted to please the company, so I came up with this wonderful interlude on the spur of the moment; and in order to take care of future public opinion, I also included the recent "turtle strike," isn't this the most realistic script that is most targeted at reality? A great director must move forward in order to get the best of both worlds!

But it's really terrible. After Zhang Shuyu finished putting on makeup, she began to regret her own feet. She shouted loudly: "How can I wear such small shoes?" Really, according to the script, not only Zhang Shuyu has small feet, but also the handmaidens, etc. have small feet. The gentleman who handled the props really worked hard and handled many three-inch red shoes, but those handmaidens all wore casual shoes, and some even didn't change their high heels. When I heard Zhang Shuyu's shout, I wasn't worried about anything else, but I was worried that the high heels had already been filmed in the scene I just filmed. I asked the cameraman, and he said: I saw it early, so all the shots were medium shots, no problem. This reminded me, why does Zhang Shuyu have to wear these red diamond shoes, everything is medium shots, isn't it OK?

"Shoot medium shots? Does the Shanghai Daotai want to lift my skirt to see my small feet?" After all, she is a big star, and she reads the script more carefully than I do. This is a close-up lens. If a pair of high heels are shown on the screen, wouldn't it be "funny"?

This is really a difficult problem. Why did I encounter this kind of difficult problem when I was promoted to director for the first time? So I had to discuss it with my old friend again. He said: I have never encountered such a difficult problem before, and the script has this paragraph, so if you don't delete it, you have to wrong Zhang Shuyu to "cut her feet to fit the shoes!"

When Zhang Shuyu heard this, she threw the high heels in her hand, and they hit me on the head. This blow pulled me back from my dream. I couldn't help but blush. "Cutting your feet to fit the shoes" is quite reasonable!

### Two Flowers of Blood

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 3 Recalls Lord Pingyuan

Behind the wall is a spacious back garden. Under the moonlight, Zhang Cangqiu saw that the man jumped to the ground and was standing there looking back to see if anyone was chasing after him. Zhang Cangqiu made a whirlwind falling leaf on the wall and jumped down, protecting his head with a precious knife. Unexpectedly, as soon as his toes landed, the man had already struck with a hammer. Zhang Cangqiu blocked the precious knife and stabbed at the man's ribs with a knife. The man dodged sideways, danced with a single hammer, and fought fiercely with Zhang Cangqiu again. Just as they fought for eight or nine rounds, there was a sudden fierce barking sound in the garden. Five Tibetan mastiffs were seen behind the pavilion, their eyes glaring, their teeth bared, and their claws waving, rushing towards this side. Seeing the two people, they pounced up to bite them, regardless of who they were. The two had no choice but to abandon their opponents and resist the mastiffs on their own. Those giant mastiffs regarded the knives and hammers as if they were nothing, and were not afraid of anything, they just pounced fiercely. If you go to chop them or hit them, they will dodge, the formation is very solid, no less than five fierce tigers, the two were actually surrounded, and could not escape. At this time, there was a clamor of voices in the house, the lights were brightly lit, and seven or eight servants, carrying lanterns, ran out with a young man. The young man was wearing a Confucian scarf on his head, but he was wearing short clothes, holding a pear flower antique gun in his hand, and stepped forward and said, "Hey! Why are you fighting here? You must know that the giant mastiffs on my estate are not easy to mess with." Then he pointed the gun in his hand, shouted at the mastiffs, and ordered them to retreat. When the mastiffs saw their master arrive and heard the order, their ferocity suddenly subsided, and they wagged their tails and retreated to the back of the pavilion. The young man said to the man: "Warrior Chen, why are you fighting with this bearded man, where did he come from? It's strange to break into someone's house in the middle of the night!" The man didn't answer immediately after hearing this. Zhang Cangqiu laughed and said, "Go and ask him. How could I be willing to run here for no reason?" (14)

### A Life View of Struggle

— Zong Yu

Some people see others failing because of struggle and think that fate is the supreme master. Rising and falling in prosperity and disgrace, nothing is not fate. If fate is not good, even if you struggle, it is in vain. It is better to live a sloppy life, and only ask the gods to pity me and give me a good fate in the next life. Ah, the word fate really harms many people, it is really the most powerful demon in the world!
