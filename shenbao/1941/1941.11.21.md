### Kurusu and Nomura Await New Instructions; U.S. Position Remains Firm; Atmosphere Seems Slightly Optimistic, But Outcome Uncertain; Japanese Newspaper Claims Tojo Has No Intention of Insisting on Demands

Washington, 20th (United Press) – Yesterday, there was a cautious optimism here about the possibility of a peaceful resolution to the major issues in U.S.-Japan relations. The two Japanese envoys are currently awaiting instructions from Tokyo regarding the points raised by Secretary of State Hull in recent long talks. If Kurusu and Nomura receive a reply from Tokyo, they may meet with Hull again this afternoon. Sources close to the Japanese and American sides in the Washington negotiations express optimism about the possibility of a peaceful resolution. However, they recognize that past efforts in the same direction have not been successful. It is said that the talks are now more promising than the talks between Hull and Ambassador Nomura when Kurusu first arrived in the United States. However, all parties believe that the talks have not yet reached a point where a definitive prediction of the outcome is possible. Recently, Senator Pepper, a Democrat from Florida, expressed Washington's attitude toward the negotiations, stating that the Senate would reject any treaty "that would make the United States a party to any of Japan's crimes." He stated that if Japan wishes peace with the United States, Japan must abandon its aggression and withdraw from China and Vietnam. Pepper said, "If Kurusu informs Washington that Japan has realized the error of its past actions, decided to eradicate the evils it has generated, and abandoned its aggression, he will be infinitely welcomed… But if he comes here to obtain our country's approval for Japan to keep its loot, or to make our country an accomplice by tacit consent to Japan's crimes, he will surely return disappointed." This statement seems to represent the attitude of Washington's congressional leaders, showing that the United States has not retreated from its previous position. Of even greater significance is Pepper's warning that "if war is the price for resisting Japan's participation in international atrocities, then war will surely come." Recently, authoritative circles have stated that Britain is receiving reports on the U.S.-Japan talks at any time.

Chongqing, 20th – Official sources here strongly endorse Senator Pepper's statement that if Japan wants to maintain peace with the United States, it must cease all acts of aggression and withdraw its troops from China and Vietnam. It is said that this is Japan's only way out. If Japan does not decide to completely break away from its crimes and abide by the Nine-Power Treaty, Secretary of State Hull's Fourteen Points, and the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration, the United States will not remain silent. As for Pepper's request that Kurusu must bear in mind that the United States is not a nation of appeasement when talking with U.S. government leaders, people here believe that this is especially sufficient to summarize the current situation between Japan and the United States.

Washington, 20th – Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that the U.S. government is unwilling to establish an agreement on the Far East situation that would allow Japan to have any control over China in politics, military affairs, and economics. It is said that he has heard that the Japanese side wants to station troops in five major cities in China, but such troops would inevitably control all of China. He expressed great admiration for China's heroic war effort. He personally feels that the only fair solution is for the Japanese army to withdraw from China.

Chinese, British, Dutch, and Australian Envoys Visit Hull for Talks

Washington, 19th – Ambassador Hu Shih visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday afternoon. This move is clearly related to developments in the Far East situation. When the ambassador left the State Department, he declined to comment, but his expression showed optimism.

Washington, 20th (Reuters) – British Chargé d'Affaires Sir Campbell visited U.S. Secretary of State Hull yesterday evening, but it has not been announced whether the Far East situation was discussed. The cold atmosphere created by Kurusu's visit to Washington still exists. Government officials are apparently quite indignant at the bellicose remarks made by Japanese leaders in Tokyo. Hull and the Japanese representatives have not held a formal meeting, and there are no appointments for today (Thanksgiving).

Washington, 20th (Reuters) – Dutch Minister to the United States Loudon visited Secretary of State Hull and Welles yesterday when U.S.-Japan discussions were temporarily suspended. It is reported that Loudon learned from the Secretary of State about the nature of the talks between the U.S. authorities and Nomura and Kurusu. Australian Minister Casey also visited the State Department yesterday.

London, 20th (Reuters) – General opinion in London is that Kurusu's mission to the United States is a delaying tactic. However, some also say that Kurusu's remarks should be listened to before the talks break down, and the reasons he holds should be carefully considered. A Washington dispatch from the Times stated that it is as clear as day that if Japan insists on sacrificing China, it will not succeed.

Tokyo, 20th (United Press) – Here, people are quietly awaiting news of the Washington talks. Japanese newspapers are also uniformly adopting a more moderate tone towards the United States. Some Japanese newspapers coincide with Washington news reports that the U.S.-Japan talks have a more optimistic trend, believing that there is a strong hope for a friendly resolution to the negotiations between President Roosevelt and special envoy Kurusu. The influential "Chugai Commercial News" stated that Japan is prepared to make concessions to the United States. According to the newspaper, which usually speaks for Japanese financial leaders, including the opinions of cabinet officials, Prime Minister Tojo, although "he announced his three principles, has no intention of insisting on Japan's demands, because mutual concessions are necessary in diplomatic negotiations." It also stated, "We believe that the United States has hope for reconsideration, and the United States must cease aid to China as a practical action." The "Teito News" declared this morning, "We do not want to witness a war between the United States and Japan. We believe that the United States also desires peace. Therefore, our only hope is for peace and tranquility in the Pacific."

### British Battleship Visits Cape Town; May Sail to the Far East Soon; Foreign Secretary Eden Warns in the House of Commons That If Japan Attacks the Burma Road, a Serious Situation Will Be Created

Cape Town, 20th (United Press) – The British elite battleship "Prince of Wales" recently sailed to this place for a short visit. British Prime Minister Churchill recently issued a message stating that Britain is now capable of increasing its strength in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, yesterday, non-official sources believed that these two matters have a wonderful mutual echo. People recalled that naval experts had predicted that Britain might send a heavy-class battleship, assisted by several cruisers and destroyers, to the Far East, especially since it is currently widely rumored that Germany has sent the elite battleship "Tirpitz" to the East to join the Japanese fleet in preparation for a war between the United States and Japan.

London, 20th (Reuters) – Yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Eden replied to a question from Mander in the House of Commons, saying that if the Burma Road is threatened, the democracies will take strong action. He thought that all concerned should know that an attack on the Burma Road would cause a serious situation. At the same time, the activities of the Japanese navy in Vietnam have also attracted attention. According to responsible sources, four Japanese cruisers have arrived in Saigon. Apart from demonstrating and putting pressure on Thailand, there is no other reason for this action by the Japanese ships. General Macksey, a military reporter for the newspaper, stated that although Thailand provides very important convenience, Japan is not sentimental in land warfare. Although the Burma Road is not an impregnable place, this road is actually more moving on the map than in reality. He believes that a naval attack on commerce by Japan is a more likely move, because Japan may continue to seize bases south to the Fiji Islands and west to Borneo Island, in order to cut off the Allies from many war supplies from their territories and the Dutch East Indies.

Stockholm, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – British Foreign Secretary Eden again expressed a hostile attitude towards Japan yesterday. He declared in the House of Commons that an attack on the Burma Road would cause a serious situation, which everyone should clearly understand. Before Eden made this statement, Member of Parliament Backham had solemnly pointed out the strategic importance of the Burma Road to the military situation of the three countries of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States in the Far East.

Japanese Ships Arrive in Vietnam to Threaten Thailand

London, 20th (United Press) – Authoritative sources stated yesterday that recent intelligence on the activities of the Japanese navy to Britain all indicated that Japan has increased pressure on Thailand, but it is not known whether this is for a joint defense alliance or to merge Thailand into Japan's "Co-Prosperity Sphere" in East Asia. Authoritative circles criticized the rumor that four Japanese cruisers had arrived in Saigon, saying, "There is no special reason for this move, because the situation there is very calm, this move is only to show their flag there." This explanation comes from a report by the United Press from Bangkok, in which a diplomat in the region expressed great pessimism and said that the situation is very dangerous. The declaration was issued at the same time as editorials in two Thai newspapers advocating closer ties with Japan, and stating that Japan's possible aggression is just propaganda. People in Bangkok all believe that the concentration of Japanese troops on the Vietnamese border is a threat to Thailand's independence. At the same time, a diplomat said that he believed Thailand wanted to remain neutral, but "it is not certain." He stated that Thailand would resist to the "last man," and if it encounters any superior force, it will order the entire country to rise up in unison, and thereafter everything will depend on the attitude of Britain and the United States.

Hanoi, 19th (Havas) – Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Yoshizawa made a statement to American reporters today, saying that Japan only wants to promote Japanese-Vietnamese relations in politics, economics, and culture with respect to Vietnam. Apart from this, there are no other intentions. Therefore, Japan does not want to expand its influence here. As for when the Japanese troops in Vietnam will be withdrawn, everything will depend on the Sino-Japanese War and the situation in the Pacific. Japan respects French sovereignty in Vietnam, and this is the case now and will be the case in the future. If a foreign country attacks French colonies, Japan will be prepared to defend Vietnam.

British Women and Children Not Allowed to Return to Hong Kong

London, 20th (Reuters) – Colonial Undersecretary George Hall said in the House of Commons last night in response to a question from Conservative Party member Knox that the political situation in the Far East does not yet allow British women and children who have left Hong Kong to return to Hong Kong, and the Colonial Office has not received reports that British women in Hong Kong must be evacuated altogether. As for the matter of British and foreign women entering Hong Kong, it currently depends entirely on the needs of Hong Kong's defense and other public services. Knox said that some British women and children were forced to evacuate from Hong Kong, but there are still 950 British women, 400 children, and many European and American women and children remaining in Hong Kong, and mixed-race people and Chinese people number as many as 750,000. Does the Colonial Office also know about this situation? Can those who have been evacuated return to Hong Kong at their own will? If those who have been evacuated are not allowed to return due to military necessity, then why not issue an order for the total evacuation of women and children? Knox asked again after the Colonial Undersecretary's reply, whether American women can be allowed to land in Hong Kong. George Hall replied that he could not say whether American women would still be allowed to land in Hong Kong, but the U.S. government had advised American women to leave the country and promised to provide ships for their departure.

Tokyo, 20th (Reuters) – The Japanese Hochi Shimbun today urged Britain to withdraw all troops in Hong Kong, including the Canadian troops who recently arrived there, because Japan has a reliable peaceful determination and is willing to maintain the integrity of Hong Kong. The newspaper has always reflected the opinions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is said that the arrival of Canadian troops is another unreasonable provocation, which cannot enhance defense against its isolated position and make Hong Kong more stable. It also stated, "It is best if Britain can withdraw all garrison troops in Hong Kong and trust Japan's peaceful intentions."

### U.S. Military Mission to Depart Soon; Large Quantities of Supplies Being Shipped to the Soviet Union

Washington, 20th (Reuters) – According to the Department of the Army, no information has been released yet regarding the U.S. military mission that will be sent to the Soviet Union. The movement of troops and other personnel is all within the scope of military secrets. However, there seems to be good reason to believe that the departure of the military mission will not be delayed for long.

Washington, 20th (Reuters) – War supplies worth 50 million U.S. dollars, which the United States did not want to ship for fear of falling into German hands, are now on their way to the Soviet Union. This shows the trust of the United States in the situation in the Soviet Union. Experts here now acknowledge that the Soviet side now has the opportunity to relieve the siege of Moscow and connect with Leningrad.

### Soviet Union's Policy Toward Japan Remains Unchanged; No Need to Hold Meetings

Tokyo, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – A spokesman for the Soviet government, Kubyshev, replied to inquiries about the current tense Soviet-Japanese relations, saying that the Soviet Union's policy toward Japan is still based on the Neutrality Pact signed last year, and there is no need for the Soviet Union and Japan to hold meetings to re-discuss the policy.

Moscow, 19th (Havas) – Japanese Foreign Minister Togo delivered a speech yesterday, saying that the Japanese government intends to continue to abide by the Japanese-Soviet Ten-Article Treaty. The local radio station recently translated and rebroadcast the full text of the speech.

### Fierce Battles Around Moscow; German Defeat on the Southern Front; Red Army Tenaciously Defends Tula

Moscow, 20th (TASS) – On the 17th, our army fought with the enemy on all fronts. The battles around Rostov, Kalinin, and Volokolamsk were particularly fierce. Our army repelled enemy offensives several times, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy in manpower and material. On the 18th, 24 German planes were shot down, and we lost 6 planes. On the central front, our air force destroyed 30 German tanks and 10 artillery pieces on the 18th and annihilated a battalion of enemy infantry. On the Gulf of Finland, a German detachment attempted to land in Kotelin, but was unsuccessful. Our army sank 6 enemy steamships.

London, 20th (Reuters) – The Soviet news agency reported that the Soviet army has recovered several key high grounds on the Crimean Peninsula. The German army was forced to abandon its occupied positions and retreat, reorganizing a new front line. The German army, which was advancing to Rostov-on-Don (known as the northern gateway to the Caucasus), launched a flanking attack in an attempt to capture the city, but failed. At the same time, the German army is fighting desperately to cut off the north-south traffic on both sides of Moscow. The Soviet Pravda telegram transmitted that the battle southeast of Tula, 100 miles south of Moscow, was extremely fierce. A German infantry regiment was killed and wounded, and in several areas of the southern front, the Soviet army advanced four to twelve miles. Moscow Radio broadcast news from the western front (Moscow) yesterday, saying that the Soviet army continued to inflict heavy blows on the enemy on the western front. The situation on the Crimean Peninsula is unclear. The German claim that they have occupied the eastern part of the peninsula has not been confirmed by the Soviet side. Moscow Radio said that the German offensives in the Kalinin area have all been repelled. The German army in the area has transferred large mechanized infantry tanks and aircraft, but although the German army has a numerical advantage and has attacked repeatedly, it has made no progress. In the Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets areas, 65 miles west and southwest of Moscow, the Soviet army is consolidating its positions. The Soviet army under Tchakachinski, on the southern left wing of the Soviet army, is now counterattacking.

Moscow, 20th (TASS) – General von Kleist's mechanized unit, famous throughout the world, rampaged through France, Belgium, the Balkans, and Ukraine, and was victorious in every battle, but has now suffered a defeat in Rostov. First, Kleist attacked Rostov with two tank divisions and two motorized infantry divisions on October 31, attempting to enter the city on November 7. The German frontal attack failed, so he changed to attacking the flanks, attempting to encircle our army, but the result was that he was encircled by our army. Enemy tanks were heavily surrounded and subjected to intense artillery fire and Soviet low-flying bombers. After a day of fighting, the Red Army gained the initiative and completely defeated the enemy. Statistics show that of the 216 tanks participating in the battle, 113 were destroyed and captured. In addition, the Germans lost 273 trucks and tens of thousands of soldiers.

Moscow, 20th (TASS) – A special correspondent from Pravda on the central front stated that in the Volokolamsk area, the enemy concentrated four infantry divisions, one SS division, and three tank divisions. A bloody battle took place in the area on the 18th. The Red Army heroically defended every inch of the country, but eventually withdrew from several points under the pressure of the enemy's force. At other points in the area, our army counterattacked and fought fiercely with the enemy, preventing the enemy from developing its offensive.

Tula Front, 20th (TASS) – A special correspondent from Izvestia stated that on the 19th, the Germans continued to launch an offensive in Tula, attacking with 100 tanks and breaking into our positions, but our army immediately cut off the connection between the enemy tanks and infantry. Most of the enemy tanks were destroyed. The battle is in progress. The Soviet artillery fiercely bombarded two villages five kilometers from Tula, which were recovered by our army. The enemy was driven out by our fierce artillery fire. Our army is determined not to allow the enemy to enter the city of Tula alive.

### First Batch of Armed U.S. Ships to Begin Sailing Within Ten Days; Secretary of the Navy Knox Officially Announces; Five New Battleships to Be Launched This Week

Washington, 20th (United Press) – Secretary of the Navy Knox announced yesterday that the first batch of armed American merchant ships will begin sailing in the middle of the tenth day after the amendment of the Neutrality Act, and it will take three or four months to arm all ships sailing on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans carrying weapons to protect weapons. He did not specify which ships would be armed first. It is believed that ships sailing in the North Atlantic, transporting goods to Britain and the Soviet Union under the Neutrality Act Amendment, will be armed first to resist the Axis raiders. He also said that he believes that American ships currently registered in Panama will be restored to American registration. Several ships have changed to flying the Panamanian flag because the government can still transport war materials to the United Kingdom, regardless of the Neutrality Act, and can enter war zones. Knox also said that there are about 1,200 American ships that can transport war supplies in the Atlantic Ocean, but said that he does not know if these ships can be armed. He also said that the Navy Department has enough artillery to serve on armed merchant ships.

Washington, 20th (United Press) – Secretary of the Navy Knox warned yesterday that the danger faced by the United States has never been as serious as it is today. Overseas forces are now thinking of doing whatever they want in the world by force. Secretary Knox also said that two new U.S. destroyers, the "Aaron Ward" and the "Sterett," and a submarine named "Grouper," will be launched on Saturday. It is said that the completion of the above three ships is several months ahead of schedule. Therefore, there will be a total of five warships launched under the two-ocean navy this week.

Moscow, 20th (TASS) – In one area of the central front, our army destroyed 65 German tanks and 35 artillery pieces in two days. In another area, our army destroyed 56 artillery pieces, 8 small machine guns, 6 small artillery positions, and annihilated about 2,500 enemy officers and soldiers.

Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – A fierce battle took place in the Donets Basin on the 17th of this month, and the Soviet army suffered heavy losses. Our anti-tank troops advanced eastward, encountering fierce resistance from the enemy army. Soviet soldiers attacked German tanks, using the forest as cover. The German army then fired a barrage of artillery, and the Soviet army suffered heavy casualties. Responsible sources in Berlin stated that in this battle, excluding the Soviet army's wounded and dead, 150 were captured by the German army.

Moscow, 20th (TASS) – A report from Izvestia from Hango Island stated that the Red Army has been defending Hango Island with a small force against a large force for five months. During this period, the defenders of Hango Island repelled 32 enemy offensives. Since the outbreak of the war, Germany and Finland have fired 500,000 shells at the island. On some days, the number reached 6,500 shells per day.

### People's Political Council Proposal Urges Government to Convene National Assembly as Soon as Possible; Enact Constitution to Realize Constitutional Government Soon; Discussion Session Yesterday Exchanged Opinions on Commodity Price Issues

Chongqing (Informed Sources) - A political proposal in the National Political Council urges the government to convene the National Assembly as soon as possible, enact a constitution, and realize constitutional government at an early date. Before this period, it is hoped that the powers of the Political Council will be expanded. The signatories are mostly people from various parties and factions, led by Chang Chun-mai, leader of the National Socialist Party. Political figures predict that there will be no problem in passing this case. The government has already made a decision to convene the National Assembly. Most of the representatives have already been elected, and the National Assembly Hall is being built in Chongqing. However, due to the fierce fighting, transportation difficulties, difficulty in gathering representatives, and the failure to elect representatives from various provinces and occupational units, the election could not proceed. Therefore, the postponement was announced last November, and the Second National Political Council, which is now in session, was organized. (Havas, 20th)

Chongqing - The National Political Council finished listening to the administrative report last night. It is resting today, but there will still be a discussion session in which the council members freely participate to exchange opinions on commodity price issues for the financial and economic group to draft a review report. The education and forestry items in the administrative report are scheduled to be released today. The social and internal affairs have not been determined. The rest will not be published as usual. It is heard that only a limited number of items were originally scheduled for publication in this session of the Political Council, but reporters publish some tidbits every day after attending the sessions to share with readers. More noteworthy are: a certain council member asked why a huge amount of foreign exchange was specially supplied to Shanghai. Yu Hongjun said that Shanghai is also the people of China. Minister of Interior Zhou Zhongyue requested that after the implementation of the new county system, the country needs more than 435,000 police officers, not including officials. Minister of Education Chen Lifu reported that from this year, national universities will no longer add more universities. The Ministry of Education now needs more than 5.56 million yuan per month to subsidize the food costs of various schools. Female council members are still very concerned about women's rights. Liu Wang Liming said that men cook better than women, so women should not go back to the kitchen. (Havas, 20th)

### Military Affairs Commission Announces War Situation for the Week of the 14th to the 20th

Chongqing – (Weekly War Situation) – A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated, November 14th to 20th, that the activities of the Japanese army this week were no different from last week. A new war is still brewing. Among the domestic battlefields, only the Chinese army's attack on Zhongmu City is worth mentioning. The rest will be recorded later.

Chinese Troops Enter Zhongmu City

On the night of the 13th, Chinese troops continued their fierce attack on the Japanese who had retreated to Zhongmu City. By 3 p.m. on the 14th, they had killed and wounded many Japanese soldiers and seized the opportunity to attack Zhongmu City from the northwest gates. The Japanese retreated to a corner and resisted stubbornly. The Chinese forces separately cleared out the scattered Japanese troops in the suburbs. A unit stationed outside the east gate of Zhongmu escaped eastward on wooden boats and planks from the vicinity of Maozhuang in the evening. They were met with fierce fire from the Chinese troops, who killed them all in the water. The Japanese in the suburbs have now been completely cleared. As for the Japanese who are resisting stubbornly inside the city, they are putting up a desperate struggle with the support of poison gas and fierce artillery fire from the opposite bank. The Chinese are stepping up their efforts to wipe them out. Another Japanese unit with four artillery pieces fled west along the old Longhai Railway to the vicinity of Sanwangzhuang (northwest of Zhongmu) on the same night, attempting to cross the river to harass the Chinese flank and relieve the Japanese troops in Zhongmu.

Japanese Army Captain in Northern Anhui Rebels

Xilin, a Japanese platoon leader stationed in Hugou, Suxian County, organized an anti-war alliance. He has been discovered by the Japanese and sent back to his country. One of his subordinates, Hisatoshi Saigoshi, a private first class, recently managed to escape from a Japanese sentry post in Suxian and surrendered to the Chinese side. According to him, the Japanese lack supplies and have difficulty replenishing them. If the British and Americans maintain a long-term blockade, their country is in danger of collapse. The war of aggression against China is not worth the losses. Therefore, most enlightened soldiers have a strong anti-war sentiment. He himself is an orphan and has no family to worry about, so he resolutely came to surrender and requested permission to join the anti-aggression alliance and become a Chinese citizen.

### Turmoil in the Japanese Diet; Miyazawa Forced to Resign; Reason: Criticism of Economic Policy; Many Colleagues Prepare to Resign En Masse

Reuters, Tokyo, November 20 – Yesterday was the last day of the extraordinary session of the Diet. Member of the House of Representatives Miyazawa spoke, uniquely criticizing the government's economic policies. He was then forced to retract his words. Miyazawa then voluntarily resigned from his position as a member of the Diet. Miyazawa is a member of the House of Representatives' Loyalist Alliance. According to the Japanese news agency, all the directors of the Alliance are likely to resign.

United Press, Tokyo, November 20 – The Japanese Diet is facing an impending internal crisis, as nineteen members of the House of Representatives' largest political party, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, have submitted their resignations from the party, expressing sympathy for Miyazawa's speech. Miyazawa's speech was apparently a criticism of the government's policies. People recall that the Emperor, in his opening address to the Diet, requested that the Diet give "harmonious consideration" to the government's bills. Therefore, Miyazawa's criticism was deemed to be culpable. Whether Miyazawa criticized the government's general policies or merely criticized the government's unprecedented massive budget of 3,800,000,000 yen is unknown.

United Press, Tokyo, November 20 – The nationalist "Hochi Shimbun," regardless of the incident of Miyazawa's expulsion, wrote an article contrasting Japan's "steel will" with the party divisions in the United States. The newspaper claimed that the unity of the Diet was "not intended to influence the Washington talks with artificial tricks." After Miyazawa delivered his speech in the Diet, he resigned from his position as secretary of the House of Representatives, which the Diet immediately accepted. Miyazawa issued a statement withdrawing his speech, saying, "My speech had the absolute opposite effect of what I originally intended, causing disputes among my colleagues in the Diet. I deeply regret this and therefore wish to resign." Prior to this, the most powerful political party in the Diet, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, decided to advise the Disciplinary Committee to instruct Miyazawa to submit his resignation, considering this fact to be unfortunate. The resolution of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association stated that the party would be responsible for the speech, but would "allow Mr. Miyazawa to voluntarily withdraw his speech." It also stated that the party would not oppose the House of Representatives leaving the matter to its Disciplinary Committee. According to Domei News Agency, this incident is the first to occur since the special session of the Diet was convened. Domei also stated that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association wished to leave the matter to the House of Representatives' Disciplinary Committee because the content of the speech was "contrary to the mission of the special session." Furthermore, Domei stated that Miyazawa's actions were likely to cause the entire committee of the National Service Association to resign. Domei also said that it was understood that Okada, the leader of the Executive Committee, would resign voluntarily, and that other Executive Committee members would follow suit. Furthermore, it was said that the movement of the group was currently being planned.

### British Offensive in Libya

The British forces in North Africa have commenced a vigorous offensive against Libya since the 18th, making rapid progress. It is recalled that on the 6th of this month, the Chairman of the Soviet State Defense Committee, Stalin, delivered a speech at the October Revolution Commemoration Meeting in Moscow, stating, "The reason why the Red Army is temporarily encountering adversity is due to the lack of a second front against Hitler in Europe; if a second front can be built in Europe, then the Red Army's position will definitely improve and be unfavorable to Germany. We firmly believe that this will become a reality in the near future." At the same time, the British Parliament and general public opinion also largely support the establishment of new battlefields, both to assist the Soviet Union and to strike at Germany. In response, the British government, since the matter involves military secrets, has avoided making a public response, but British Prime Minister Churchill, known as a strategist, certainly fully recognizes the importance of this point and is actively arranging for its realization. Yesterday's newspaper carried a Reuters dispatch from London stating that the British authorities are significantly refreshing the ranks of the army and that there will be important changes in its senior command: the current Commander-in-Chief of the Home Forces, General Brooke, will succeed General Dill as Chief of the Imperial General Staff; Lieutenant General Paget, Commander-in-Chief of the Southeastern Command, will succeed as Commander-in-Chief of the Home Forces; and General Dill will take office as Governor of Bombay Province in India. According to the observation of Reuters' military correspondents, this change is the prelude to Britain engaging in land warfare in a more active form. Therefore, the unfolding of the North African offensive is likely the prelude to the British army opening up a second front and launching a large-scale land counteroffensive.

Let us examine the British combat capability. The navy is undoubtedly its backbone, but as a result of recent military buildup and preparedness, the British army and air force are also considerable, and the air force in particular has made rapid progress in both quality and quantity, repeatedly demonstrating its power in Europe. If Britain opens up a land battlefield against Germany, it will certainly use the army in coordination with the air force as the main force in combat. However, to fully exploit its own advantages, it should mobilize the navy to launch offensive attacks with the cooperation of the navy and army. Suitable battlefields for the British army to land and operate in, in Western Europe, are Norway and the west coast of France; in Southern Europe, Italy and the Balkans; and in North Africa, Libya. However, Norway is remote in the northwest and insufficient to be the center of the war situation. Although the occupied areas of France and the various places in Italy and the Balkans are experiencing famine and popular resentment is boiling, due to the convenience of transportation, they are a tightly connected entity with the German mainland. German reinforcements can arrive from morning until evening, which is unfavorable to the British army landing and attacking across the sea. However, Libya is different. Libya is an Italian territory, now jointly defended by Germany and Italy. However, after Mussolini's several "purges," the actual command authority has completely fallen into the hands of the Germans. However, the German generals and officers, as foreigners, hold the power to issue orders, but ultimately fail to unify the morale of the army, and the fighting spirit is greatly reduced as a result. Moreover, there is the Mediterranean Sea between Germany and Italy and Libya, and control of the Mediterranean Sea is still in the hands of the British. Although it is not impossible for Axis personnel and weapons to be smuggled to North Africa, there is a great danger involved, and they can be sunk or captured by British patrol ships at any time. In addition, Egypt is a British military ally, and its operational base is shared with the British. After Duke Aosta, the commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in Abyssinia, surrendered to the British on May 20 of this year, the entire East Africa and Red Sea area has been completely under British control. Therefore, in terms of the strategic situation on the West European continent, the Axis powers are waiting at their ease, while in the North African strategic situation, Britain is the main body. Therefore, the British army is launching a counteroffensive here in an advantageous position. Last winter and this spring, when General Wavell was stationed in Cairo, he also launched exploratory offensives against Libya. At that time, Germany and Italy had not yet opened the war against the Soviet Union and were able to use more power to cope with the British offensive. As for today, the Soviet Union is fighting with all its might against the elite German forces in Eastern Europe, and Germany has absolutely no sufficient spare power to attend to other things. Therefore, the British army in North Africa, coordinating with the British fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, is launching a large-scale westward offensive, which should be able to achieve more gains and establish permanent war results.

At this time, foreign news came that General Weygand, the French Governor-General of Africa, was suddenly dismissed by the Vichy government. General Weygand has been stationed in Africa since France's defeat last year, commanding a portion of the armed forces to provide strong support for Vichy; Pétain was sometimes able to cope with Germany quite strongly, and Weygand had a powerful role in this. His sudden dismissal is likely related to this, and Germany's desire for French territories in Africa, constantly increasing pressure on France, can also be seen from this. The French North Africa is of great importance both militarily and economically, just as it is to the western Mediterranean as Egypt is to the eastern Mediterranean; and French West Africa is both a springboard for developing influence towards South America and sufficient to control the South Atlantic. It is within Germany's intention to want to obtain this and be satisfied. At the same time, Germany has recently made quite a few attempts towards Turkey and Spain. All of these factors further increase the importance of the British army's offensive in North Africa. Currently, Libya is the only central base of the Axis powers in Africa. If it can be wiped out in one fell swoop, it will not only consolidate Britain's control over Africa and eliminate Germany's attempt to expand its power in Africa, but also make the Mediterranean transportation line connecting Britain and the Soviet Union more secure, so as to lay the foundation for further military development in the future.

### Allied Forces on the Nile Launch Offensive in North Africa, Penetrate 50 Miles into Libyan Territory, British Naval and Air Forces Also Join the Battle

Reuters, Cairo, 20th – Last night, an official gazette issued here stated that the Allied forces led by General Auchinleck have launched a new offensive against the Axis forces in the western desert, making rapid progress. By the end of the first day, they had penetrated over fifty miles into enemy territory. Until then, they had only encountered slight resistance from the enemy. Today’s military operations are proceeding according to plan. British forces are currently advancing along a 140-mile-wide arc-shaped front, from Sollum southward through the desert to Giarabub. The British right wing is advancing westward from the Halfaya Pass to Sidi Omar, while British armored vehicles, aided by infantry, have crossed the border eastward, attacking enemy coastal positions. The British communiqué mentioned the absence of enemy air support, which observers here consider unsurprising. Axis aircraft in North Africa may be inactive due to fuel conservation. It is reported that heavy rains are currently falling in the war zone, which has both advantages and disadvantages for the British forces. The advantage is that it is difficult for the enemy to observe, but the disadvantage is that the land is muddy. Now that General Auchinleck has launched the attack, the active preparations of many months can be revealed. Although everyone knew that there would be developments in the western desert and saw troops, artillery, tanks, and military supplies being transported westward in a steady stream, few understood the thoroughness of the British preparations. First, transportation had to be improved to transport food and supplies to support the large army. Old roads were renovated, and new roads were built, with the assistance of road-building machinery transported from South Africa. Storage depots were also built in various locations to store gasoline, ammunition, food, and water. Only after all preparations were complete did General Auchinleck issue the order to attack. The preparations for this offensive have many similarities to the preparations before the offensive last year, especially the assembly of the large army. The British forces are now taking the initiative and moving forward, but there is one peculiar factor: the line of fortifications built by the Germans this summer from the coast southward along the border to Sidi Omar appears to have no effect in stopping the British advance.

Reuters, Cairo, 20th – After the British forces in the western desert launched their offensive, they captured several enemies, all of whom were German soldiers. The British Navy is currently bombarding the Halfaya Pass, and the Germans, caught by surprise, are panicked and their formations are collapsing.

British Forces Continue Westward, Three Axis Divisions Trapped

Reuters, London, 20th – According to the latest news received here, the British forces stationed on the Nile, recently renamed the Eighth Army, with the assistance of a strong British Air Force, have suddenly taken action in the western desert, attacking over fifty miles into enemy territory in Libya and are continuing to advance westward. According to a dispatch from Cairo, two German divisions are now cut off between Bardia and Tobruk, and one Italian division is trapped south of Tobruk. British fighter squadrons shot down eighteen German and Italian aircraft in the initial air battles. South African Air Force bombers also attacked enemy transport vehicles and armored vehicles, inflicting heavy damage. Today, both German and Italian communiqués mentioned the British offensive in Libya.

Reuters, London, 20th – The Nile Garrison (mostly British, Australian, New Zealand, and Indian troops) launched an offensive against Axis forces in the western desert at dawn on Tuesday. The British fleet has joined the battle, heavily bombarding Halfaya and Sollum. At the same time, the British Air Force destroyed eighteen enemy aircraft in its first large-scale air battle, including five transport aircraft. Although the British offensive was expected, the Germans were caught by surprise and panicked, causing their formations to disperse, and several German soldiers were captured. The British line of advance extends from the coast east of Sollum to Giarabub, about 130 miles long. The three leaders of this campaign are: on land, Lieutenant General Cunningham, who has successfully fought in East Africa and now commands the Allied convoys west of Alexandria; at sea, his brother, Admiral Cunningham, currently Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet; and in the air, Air Vice-Marshal Coningham, currently Commander of the Western Desert Air Force.

Deliberate Preparations for Over a Year, Conditions for Offensive Completed

Reuters, London, 20th (Special) – A Reuters correspondent telegraphed from the western desert that the British people have been waiting for news of a new British offensive in the western desert for many weeks, and now this news has finally arrived. The new offensive undertaken by the British forces under the command of General Auchinleck comes exactly one year and three weeks after General Wavell first launched his "Desert Blitzkrieg," advancing five hundred miles in two months and capturing 110,000 Italian soldiers. General Auchinleck, succeeding General Wavell in command of the British forces in the western desert, has prepared deliberately and must have drawn up his plans as carefully as General Wavell. He waited until the scorching sun of the desert weakened, military supplies were transported from Britain, and the British Navy sank as many enemy ships as possible before launching this new offensive. Although the enemy’s strength and preparation are stronger than the Italian army, General Auchinleck’s new offensive has signs of success in many ways. The British Air Force has established air superiority in the western desert, so the British supply lines are much safer than the enemy's. This is extremely important in a battle fought along two or three roads in the desert. The British supply lines in this offensive have been greatly assisted by the Italian army, as the Italian army built excellent motor roads from Barrani to Alam el Rabita on the Libyan border when they invaded Egyptian territory. Building this road in peacetime would cost about £60,000. When the Italian army was driven out of Egypt by the British army, the road was not yet completed, but it has since been built by the British army and engineers and is a shortcut for British armored vehicles and supply trucks to reach the front line. Another immeasurable help in this British offensive is the presence of British and Polish troops in Tobruk, behind enemy lines. These troops have endured the heat, sandstorms, and bombings for a long time and will now be rewarded for their perseverance. Tobruk is an excellent naval port where supplies and reinforcements can be landed to assist in the battle. However, we should not expect this offensive to achieve the same rapid results as last year, as an important factor in last year's victory was that British infantry tanks were superior to Italian tanks. Now, the Germans have transported a large number of heavily armored tanks and anti-tank guns to Libya, so a fierce battle between the mechanized units of the two armies seems inevitable. But one thing is certain: the British armored units will fight the enemy with the same bravery they showed last year, and after actively preparing for over a year, they must be eager to fight the enemy to the death. Most of the British soldiers participating in this offensive have participated in other battles in this war, and some have been transferred to the western desert after triumphs in Eritrea and Syria. These men said that their only wish was to fight the Germans again on more equal terms, and now they have this opportunity. On the barren desert land, the conditions for the British and German armies are almost the same, because the Germans have no Fifth Column or political conspiracies to help them in the western desert.

Britain Responds to Allied Soviet Union, New Anti-Axis Front

Reuters, London, 20th – A Reuters correspondent with the British forces in Libya telegraphed that the British and German armies are now fighting on the battlefields of the western desert, and Britain has responded to the call of its ally, the Soviet Union, by opening a new front against the Axis powers. Although the number of German troops in North Africa is smaller than the number of Italian troops, the current campaign is the first test of strength between the British and German armies after the battles of Greece and Crete. Moreover, most of the British soldiers participating in this offensive are from the British Isles, and the proportion of those from the Dominions is smaller than before. British soldiers are now choosing to fight the Germans because killing one German soldier is better than capturing six Italian soldiers. In the week or two before the British forces began their attack, the roads and railways along the Mediterranean Sea to Mersa Matruh were busy with transport. Reporters saw trains loaded with tanks arriving in a steady stream, and convoys of trucks stretched for thirty miles along the roads, each convoy equipped with no fewer than one hundred anti-aircraft guns. In short, the British preparations were extremely thorough.

Reuters, Cairo, 10th – According to a communiqué from the British Air Force in the Middle East, the British Air Force destroyed eighteen German aircraft during offensive patrols over Cyrenaica on Tuesday. Naples, Italy, was also one of the targets of the British bombers. British aircraft also attacked enemy convoys in the central Mediterranean Sea on the same day, and a medium-sized merchant ship was hit, exploded, and caught fire. One British aircraft did not return.

Reuters, Cairo, 20th – On the eve of the British offensive in the western desert, British generals read to the troops a special message of encouragement from British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

Reuters, New York, 20th – All newspapers here published the British offensive in Libya in large print. Newspaper editorials and radio commentators believe that the British forces are well-equipped and consider this offensive to be a full-scale effort to eliminate the Axis forces in Africa. Some commentators say that this offensive is a timely move to eliminate possible surprise actions by Berlin and Vichy in North Africa. Others say that American equipment plays an important role in this offensive.

Reuters, Sydney, 20th – The Australian public is elated by the British offensive in Libya. All newspapers reported it in large headlines. When Minister for the Army Ford announced the news in the House of Representatives, the entire House cheered.

### River Journey in Sichuan (II)

— Ji Sheng

The boat was already groaning under the resistance of the rapids, “clap, clap”. The helmsman held the rudder with his right hand, and with his left hand, he held a bamboo pole, raising his backside and pushing forward. The two trackers on the shore bore an even heavier burden, their limbs on the ground, their chests parallel to the ground, incessantly “ah-ho, ah-ho”, but unable to move forward even half a step. “Guys, lend a hand!” The call for help replaced “ah-ho”. Five new recruits rushed up together, grabbing the tow rope made of woven bamboo strips. Surprisingly, the rushing water could not withstand the combined strength of these eight people, and the boat slowly moved forward.

Learning the steps of the old trackers, walking leisurely on the red sand beach, suddenly the tow rope led us to a pebble beach. The heat of the pebbles under the sunlight touched the tender soles of every new tracker, eliciting a chorus of cries of pain. The weight in our hands prevented us from escaping this pain, and the dampness by the water made us reluctant to put on clean cloth shoes. So, “Straw sandals, straw sandals, go to Qianwei to get straw sandals!” The suggestion of the old trackers became the decision of the new trackers. But none of the old trackers were wearing straw sandals.

Finally, we were pulled into the water by the tow rope, “Ah, how comfortable!” The water was warmed by the sun, and our feet stepped on the smooth pebbles, feeling refreshing and cool. The heavy footsteps disturbed the quietness of the water and scattered the gatherings of the small fish! This kind of waterside gave the new trackers with an air of elegance a great temptation. Some even wanted to play the game of catching small fish after the boat had passed the rapids and they were relieved of their responsibility.

The boat ran aground on a bend in the pebble beach. Two old trackers wearing long gowns walked down to the river and slowly guided the boat into deeper water. When working in the water, they rolled up their long gowns to their waists, revealing that they were not wearing trousers. After going ashore, they transformed themselves again and resumed their cultured appearance. At this time, I, lying on the grass waiting for the boat to move, was quite interested in this. But looking into the distance, there was a worker standing in the upper reaches of the river carrying our boat, the water reaching his chest, he simply turned his long gown down and wore it as a turban on his head. Someone said, “The people of Sichuan are truly cultured, even the laborers often wear a long gown.” However, the boatmen had to do this for the sake of politeness and for the convenience of work. If you go to desolate and precipitous sections, you can see batches of naked trackers pulling cargo ships without female passengers. It’s as if you were in a German health camp, which was heavily promoted ten years ago!

After passing Qianwei, we often crossed hillsides and harbors. Walking up a hill, the boatmen would ask for someone to be assigned to “guard the rear”, to take care of the tow rope, so as not to get caught on tree branches or rocks and hinder progress. This was a very arduous task; sometimes we had to cross unnecessary sharp peaks, sometimes we had to climb onto large rocks jutting out from the river bank, sometimes we lagged far behind, sometimes we moved forward very quickly. So, we often took turns, or even two people worked at the same time. If we encountered the most arduous and dangerous moments, the boatmen had to take matters into their own hands.

When we reached the Wen River or places unsuitable for towing, we had to all get on the boat and drift across the river. In a section where cliffs and precipices gathered on both sides of the river, our small wooden boat with a shallow draft traveled along the foot of the cliff, while using bamboo poles to push against the conical cavities carved into the smooth cliff face – these cavities are the crystallization of the hard work of countless boatmen over the centuries. "Human ingenuity is great", we moved forward effortlessly following the trails of our predecessors, and could not help but exclaim in this way.

At this time, a heavily loaded boat was sailing in the middle of the river. The helmsman standing on the elevated wooden platform at the stern of the boat was steering the boat while beating a small drum, and the sound of the drum was combined with the sound of twelve oars and the sound of “ah-ho” sung by twelve boatmen. When the boat reached the rapids, all the rowers turned around and desperately pulled back on the oars. The sound of the drum became faster, the sound of the oars became faster, and the sound of “ah-ho” also became faster, and at the same time, a series of footsteps on the deck was heard. Passing through the valley, all the sounds stopped, and the rowers successively jumped into the water and walked on the tow path to pull the boat.

### C Zone Handover Issue to be Decided by Garrison Conference, Part of Defense Already Handed Over to the Municipal Council, US Military Equipment Transported to Pudong Yesterday, Over 1,000 British Nationals in Occupied Areas Preparing to Evacuate

The American President Lines has dispatched the President Van Buren to Qinhuangdao to transport the US troops stationed in North China and dispatched the President Madison and President Harrison to Shanghai to transport the Fourth Regiment of the US Marine Corps stationed in this city. The President Madison is scheduled to arrive at 3:30 PM today and is scheduled to dock at buoys 14 and 15. There will be a slight delay in Shanghai. It is said that it will depart for the Philippines at the same time after the President Harrison arrives in Shanghai next Tuesday (25th). The President Madison has brought a large number of goods from the United States this time. It is said that the goods destined for the Philippines and this city will not be loaded, but passenger tickets will be sold as usual.

Garrison Conference to be Held Soon

With the withdrawal of the Fourth Regiment of the US Marine Corps imminent, the Municipal Council held a meeting yesterday (19th) to discuss the issue of the handover of Zone C left by the US Marines, but no decision was made. It is reported that the Municipal Council will listen to the final decision of the conference of commanders of the various countries' garrisons regarding the handover of Zone C and has notified the secretary of the conference of this intention. A reporter inquired of one of the members of the conference this morning, who said that the date of the meeting had not been determined but said that it would probably be held soon. The members of the conference are the commanders of the US, Japanese, and Italian garrisons, the commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and the Commissioner of Police of the Municipal Council. It is rumored that part of the US Navy will leave Shanghai first on two special ships for the evacuation of Americans. According to Colonel Howard, commander of the Fourth Regiment, this is indeed true and should not be considered strange. However, the American President Lines has denied the rumor that the special ship for the evacuation of Americans will leave Shanghai on Saturday (22nd). It is said that the ship will remain in Shanghai for a longer period.

Part of the Defense Has Already Been Handed Over

It is said that the US Navy handed over the defense of the area along the Suzhou Creek from the New Zhapu Bridge to Yichang Road to the Municipal Council on the 18th. All the military telephones, watch posts, and sentry posts installed by the US military have been successively removed. At 1:30 PM that afternoon, the Putuo Road Police Station of the Police Department dispatched Japanese police officer Kurata and one Chinese, Japanese, and Indian constable each to take over the area.

Howard Pays Courtesy Visit to Japanese Military Officers

Colonel Howard, commander of the Fourth Regiment of the US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, accompanied by Major Hamilton and Captain Pettick, visited Major General Ooka at the Japanese Naval Commissioner's Office on Haining Road at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. At 9:30 AM, they boarded the Izumo warship and visited Vice Admiral Koga, commander of the Japanese Fleet in China. At 10:00 AM, they visited Rear Admiral Makita, commander of the Japanese Naval Special Landing Forces, to bid farewell and express their gratitude for their past cooperation.

US Military Equipment Begins to Be Transported

A large number of luggage, equipment, and materials of the US garrison stationed in Shanghai began to be transported yesterday morning under the order of the US garrison commander. The equipment was transported in batches by military trucks to the Municipal Council Wharf on the Bund on Fuzhou Road and then transferred to Pudong by a small wheel boat. It is said that after the President Harrison arrives in Shanghai, it will dock at the Pudong Wharf.

### Shops Refuse to Sell Price-Controlled Goods, Causing Shortages, Indirectly Undermining Price Controls Should be Investigated and Punished Promptly, Method for Limiting the Price of National Rice Has Been Agreed Upon

Since the Municipal Council stipulated the price control of daily necessities, the residents of this city have been cheering. Unexpectedly, some shops, because they could not profit from selling at the controlled prices, refused to sell the price-controlled goods. For example, Scott's Emulsion is limited to 21.84 yuan for a large bottle and 12.63 yuan for a small bottle, but now pharmacies on the market all vaguely claim to have no goods to sell, resulting in another vicious phenomenon of "goods with prices but no goods", giving a huge blow to the price control decree. It is hoped that the Municipal Council will uphold its original intention of suppressing and stabilizing prices, find ways to conduct a thorough investigation, and immediately establish regulations to punish those shops that allegedly refuse to sell price-controlled goods under the pretext of having no goods, so as to prevent the secret sabotage of unscrupulous merchants. In addition, Mr. Lang, secretary of the Shanghai Consular Body, yesterday denied the rumor that the Consular Body would hold a meeting to discuss price control measures.

Confiscated Milk Powder to be Given to Orphans

It was learned yesterday that the Krining milk powder confiscated by the French Concession Police Department from various stores on the 10th of this month will be donated to orphanages and charitable organizations. These milk powders were all confiscated by the French Police Department because their selling prices were higher than the controlled prices. The authorities have ordered that the milk powder currently stored at the police station be distributed to three orphanages. It is said that a certain pharmacy at No. 601 Avenue Joffre, which was sealed on November 10, resumed business on the 14th. A certain store at No. 25 Rue du Pere Froc, which was sealed, resumed business on the 17th. Another store will also resume business today. These three stores were all sealed for selling Krining milk powder at prices exceeding the controlled prices, resulting in the confiscation of a total of 75 pounds of the milk powder and temporary closure. Now, they are resuming business one after another. It is also said that police officers from the French Police Department recently searched a store on Route Vallon and found six bottles of copper cleaner, the selling price of which was higher than the controlled price, and confiscated them.

Investigating Flour to Prepare for Management

The Municipal Council recently issued a notice that, starting from today, it will register the inventory of flour. All businesses, banks, groups, and individuals, etc., who have more than one month's worth of flour for their own use must register with Office No. 701 of the General Office of the Municipal Council (entrance from the square) before the 27th of this month and submit the daily flour consumption for reference. The French Concession will also do the same.

Price Control of National Rice will also be Implemented

The Food Rice Management Committee of the Municipal Council believes that the destination of national rice is no less than that of foreign rice. If price control is not implemented, it will affect the future of the people's food. After a long period of consultation, a decision was made to limit the selling price of national rice. All the methods have now been agreed upon in order, and they can be implemented as soon as they are discussed with the rice industry committees. According to the rice industry committees, they agree with the Food Rice Management Committee's method of evaluating and setting standard selling prices for national rice. Therefore, the entire food supply in the city will become more stable in the future.

According to the Rice Trade Association, the rice merchants have registered the foreign rice they imported in the past that has not yet left the warehouse. However, the Municipal Council does not issue permits to transport the rice out of the warehouse when the rice is needed for retail sales, asking for help. The association is currently processing the registration in order to negotiate with the authorities.

It is also reported that the first phase of collective rice sales was originally scheduled for 20,000 bags, but because the settlement and delivery procedures are very complicated, several thousand bags have not yet been delivered. However, rice merchants who lack rice are very much in need of the rice for the market. It is said that the leaders of the bean and rice industry and the rice merchant industry are discussing ways to improve the situation and plan to request the French Concession authorities to approve the delivery of rice from rice warehouses in the French Concession so that rice merchants who lack rice can [blank space].

Over a Thousand British Nationals Preparing to Evacuate

An official from the British Consulate in Shanghai said yesterday morning that 1,175 British nationals registered in the occupied areas of China may gather in Shanghai to wait for the evacuation ships sent by the British government to depart. Preparations for the arrival of the evacuation ships in Shanghai have not yet begun, but such preparations may begin soon and will be directed by the military authorities. Many Chinese nationals who were born in Singapore and Hong Kong and became British citizens are seeking passports from the Passport Office of the British Consulate General in the hope of leaving Shanghai as soon as possible. The British Consulate recently advised British nationals in the occupied areas of China to register and warned that this may be the last opportunity to evacuate China. At the same time, the British authorities in Shanghai have recruited a batch of soldiers, including some Russians, who will depart for Singapore in two days to join the British Army.

First, American Judge of Appeals Hale Melick read President US's Thanksgiving Day Proclamation. American Consul Stanton introduced the speakers, Bishop Roberts led the ceremony, and Pastor Qu Fanfu blessed the congregation after the service.

Mr. Mingside of the American Presbyterian Church

(American Director of the Municipal Council) delivered a speech, saying, "Even in today's world, which is suffering from various pains, the American people still have much to be grateful for, such as in the current struggle, America stands on the side of justice and has the opportunity to establish justice and fairness in the world after winning. Other things such as the promotion of democracy in the United States and the possession of raw materials and technology to implement its program of self-defense and helping others should also be thanked for God's grace. Now, Britain has not been invaded, the German-Soviet alliance has collapsed, the United States has not yet engaged in shooting wars, and in Shanghai, we enjoy a degree of peace and security that is better than we had anticipated one year ago when we bid farewell to our relatives and friends.

"The situation has not worsened," making us feel sincere gratitude. The American people can also discover a better way of life and establish a new world order from the errors of purpose, plan, and ideal, not allowing aggression, selfishness, abuse of power, and hatred to exist. My allies have the permanent power in the universe and will surely win."

### Hong Kong Government Promulgates New Ordinance: Assisting in the Management of Legal Tender, Prohibiting Free Acceptance and Delivery and Strictly Prohibiting Exit, Authorizing Special Permits for Various Industries

At the request of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, to assist the Chinese government in implementing its policy of managing legal tender, the Hong Kong government has promulgated a new ordinance prohibiting the free trading of national currency and authorizing designated banks to purchase and remit Chinese national currency with special permission. However, any transaction specially approved by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee is not subject to this restriction.

New Ordinance Enforces Strict Restrictions

The new ordinance promulgated by the Hong Kong government states that any action, whether within or outside Hong Kong, that directly or indirectly creates, in whole or in part, or causes or assists in any foreign exchange transaction involving Chinese national currency, unless it is with or through a merchant or registered bank authorized by Section 1 of the ordinance, is prohibited. Anyone who owns, holds, possesses, or controls any Chinese national currency banknotes must report the total amount of banknotes to a certain person in accordance with the method instructed by the Governor during a specified period, unless (A) before November 14, 1941, or (B) they obtained, held, possessed, or controlled the banknotes, and (C) during a specified period. The following circumstances do not require reporting: (A) the total amount of banknotes owned does not exceed 5,000 national currency; (B) there is a legal business, or is a shareholder or manager of a legal business established in Hong Kong before November 6, 1941, and the banknotes owned are more than 5,000 national currency but do not exceed 30,000 national currency and are for the necessary use of the business.

Exit Prohibited Except to Mainland China

Any person holding national currency shall apply for registration, and the Registrar shall issue a certificate to the registrant or any applicant requesting permission to hold Chinese national currency banknotes. The certificate shall state the total amount of banknotes that the registrant or permitted holder is allowed to hold, and the amount may be increased or decreased within the limit. Anyone who owns, holds, possesses, or controls any Chinese currency banknotes, whether within or outside Hong Kong, except in China, is violating any such permit and is committing an offense. Any action of importing or exporting any Chinese national currency banknotes from Hong Kong, or any action of importing that directly or indirectly causes or leads to a change in the amount, and anyone who possesses or controls any Chinese national currency banknotes outside China, regardless of how and where they are placed, unless that person is of Chinese nationality and the change is only to increase or decrease the number within the limit prescribed in the certificate issued under the provisions of Section 2,

### The Seized Southern Ship Has Been Secretly Sailed Out of Port; No Customs Declaration Procedures Were Completed Prior; Shipping Industry Claims It Sailed to Japan

The Yugoslavian merchant ship S.S. Tomislav, with a displacement of 5,411 tons, a deadweight of 3,149 tons, a length of 403 feet, a width of 52 feet, and a draft of 27.5 feet, was built in September 1928. It arrived in Shanghai with cargo this year and was managed by the British firm Tilston & Co. When the ship arrived in Shanghai, Yugoslavia fell. The Italian navy stationed in Shanghai sent sailors aboard the ship to seize it. However, the ship was still unable to leave the port and was moved to Bouy 11/12 in Southern Whangpoo, where it has remained for over half a year. The day before yesterday (the 19th), it suddenly sailed out of port secretly. According to eyewitnesses, the ship passed the Lujiazui shore around 6:00 PM and exited the Wusong port around 8:00 PM. No customs declaration or clearance procedures were completed prior. According to the shipping industry, it is believed to have sailed to Japan.

### United States Specially Permits Chinese Merchant Banks to Operate Bills of Exchange

In order to assist China in replenishing its foreign exchange fund, the United States government has specifically ordered the Department of the Treasury to amend General Circular No. 58, which was issued previously. The correspondent banks of these Chinese banks in the United States have received notification from the U.S. side. The amendment to Circular No. 58 will not arrive in Shanghai from the United States until the end of this month. The content of the amendment will grant the same rights to eight Chinese merchant banks, including Che Hsing Bank, Che Hsin Industrial Bank, Bank of Kwangtung, Kin Cheng Banking Corporation, Overseas Chinese Bank, Bank of East Asia, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, and China興業 Bank, to jointly operate import and export bills of exchange for any part of China (excluding Manchuria) with fourteen Allied banks such as HSBC, Citibank, and the four major national banks. Any bank in the United States, when conducting foreign exchange transactions arising from import and export trade that comply with the provisions of the circular, such as issuing or certifying letters of credit, accepting or paying bills of exchange, or other payments or transfers, shall, before undertaking such transactions, verify, based on shipping documents or other methods, that the transaction does indeed meet the following conditions: Such transactions must be legitimate and normal imports and exports, and the value of the imports or exports must be equivalent to the amount of foreign exchange generated. Such imports and exports must comply with the terms and conditions prescribed in the circular.

### Installation of Fluorescent Lamps (Continued): Electricity Company Management Regulations

— Wang Jingrong

Based on the examples mentioned above, the fairest transaction is when the quantity purchased equals the quantity delivered, that is, the ratio of the quantity purchased to the quantity delivered should be one hundred to one hundred. If this ratio is lower, it is abnormal and unfair. This ratio is commercially called the "commodity ratio" or "commodity factor," while in electricity, the ratio of the actual electricity consumed by electrical appliances to the electricity supplied by the generator is called the "power factor."

Usually, few commodities are sold with a low "commodity factor," that is, they are not sold in a "giving more, buying less" manner. We never buy two baskets of charcoal today and return one basket tomorrow, or buy several baskets again later and return part of them. The same is true when buying gasoline or gas. Why should the purchase and use of electricity be any different? However, many electrical appliances, such as fluorescent lamps, have a natural characteristic that when connected to a 50-cycle alternating current, whether we realize it or not, a pair of wires transmits a "packet" of electricity every hundredth of a second, and these appliances only use part of it and return the rest that is not needed. These appliances can be called "trial customers" of electricity. Therefore, the generating and feeding mechanisms of the electricity company increase unnecessary work due to the frequent return of current, just like a carpet store paying unnecessary transportation and labor costs due to the return of carpets. Moreover, there are many styles and sizes of carpets, and the "giving more, buying less" system is sometimes tolerated by reason. However, the quality of the electricity supplied by the electricity company is uniform, and the styles are the same. Therefore, the calculation of electricity prices does not include the cost of this useless service, nor is there any reason to include the cost of this useless service. If users of fluorescent lamps are allowed to enjoy this "giving more, buying less" (i.e., low power factor) right, the result will generally increase the electricity company's costs, which will affect the general electricity rate, and users who do not use fluorescent lamps will also be affected. This is another abnormal and unfair situation, which is unacceptable to fair users. Fortunately, the drawback of this low power factor is not an incurable disease. It can be corrected by using a device called a capacitor or condenser. Not only that, the effect of a capacitor is not only to eliminate unnecessary consumption but also to promote the economic efficiency of users. Its benefits to users are not limited to one aspect. The details are listed below: When users retrofit fluorescent lamps, if the "power factor" of the lamp has been corrected by a capacitor, the load on the wires is less, and more lamps can be installed without replacing the original wires, resulting in more light. If the same number of lamps are installed in a new installation, thinner wires can be used. A high power factor installation can reduce the current flow in the user's circuit, thus improving the voltage of the lamps and increasing the function of the lamps. The reduction of current in the circuit can reduce the power consumption loss after the circuit and save electricity bills. Twenty-watt and forty-watt lamps, when equipped with high power factor "dual lamp" ballasts, emit more light per unit of electricity than any other type of equipment. (The End)

### The Price-Controlled "Salvend" is Not Produced by Universal Drug Store

We hereby acknowledge receipt of a letter from the Universal Drug Store, regarding the "List of Price-Controlled Items in the First Batch" published in your newspaper on the 19th of this month. In the column, the price of one tablet of "Salvend" Sulfolid produced by Schering Corporation and sold by G. Lie & Company is 9 yuan and 45 cents for 15 tablets. Our company's registered trademark of 25 tablets is sold for only 3 yuan and 60 cents. This is not only easy to cause misunderstanding, but also related to our company's exclusive right to use the registered trademark, which is difficult to ignore. We have already written to the company to inquire about this. According to their reply, the (Sulphaui Iamide Tablets) produced by Schering Corporation are entirely in English on the packaging and do not have the Chinese characters for "Salvend." The meaning of the English words is also different. It is thought that the newspaper made a translation error, etc. This is consistent with the footnote at the end of your newspaper, which states that most of the Western medicines do not have Chinese names. However, the Chinese "Salvend" reported in the newspaper is actually mixed up with our company's products. We are writing to you accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and correct it.

### Shen Bao Reader's Scholarship: Second Session Begins, Scope Slightly Expanded to Seek Universality, Accepting Donations from All Sectors Starting Today

The financial report of the first Shen Bao Reader's Scholarship campaign has already been published in yesterday's newspaper. After the students who applied for scholarships in the first session received their funds and enrolled in school, in addition to the temporary donations from all sectors that have been published in this newspaper, we are now preparing for the second scholarship. The details of the progress are recorded as follows to inform all sectors of society who care about the scholarship:

This Session's Scope Strives for Universality

Our newspaper has received letters from the generous donors of scholarships, such as the anonymous elderly and readers from all walks of life, asking whether the income and expenses of the previous semester can be offset, or urging us to start the second session, or expressing their willingness to generously assist, or donating free school places. We are deeply grateful for their concern. It has now been decided to continue the program immediately. However, considering the soaring prices recently, which are extremely different from a few months ago, it is certain that there will be even more young students who are in school, struggling with their finances, and finding it difficult to continue their studies than in the previous session. The only way is to make it clear to all sectors of society, deeply hoping to raise enough funds to allow the students who have already received assistance to continue their studies with peace of mind, and to assist those who have not received assistance and are about to drop out of school due to financial difficulties to return to school. In the future, these students will be cultivated by society and the public. After this period of hardship and diligence, they will surely repay society, and the donations of enthusiastic people from all walks of life will always be models for society.

Funds Will Not Be Wasted, We Will Handle Matters with Solemnity

The need for scholarships in this session is so urgent. We will definitely be more cautious in handling the scholarship matters in this session, striving to ensure that diligent students do not drop out of school and solemnly allocate the funds, ensuring that not a single penny is wasted, in order to thank all sectors for their generous donations. If readers sympathize and wish to donate, please send it directly to the Business Department of this newspaper for collection and obtain an official receipt. This newspaper will publish the names and amounts of all donors in each issue. Once this session is completed, the total income and expenditure will be published as usual for credibility.

Mr. Xu CaiCheng's Enthusiastic Scholarship

Mr. Xu CaiCheng wrote to this newspaper yesterday, stating that a memorial service was held for his late wife, Mrs. Mao, the day before yesterday. Thanks to the remaining contributions and savings from relatives and friends, in accordance with the wishes of his late wife, Mrs. Mao, the funds will be distributed to charitable causes. He is now donating 1,000 yuan to the scholarship fund sponsored by your newspaper, and he asks for your kind consideration. Mr. Xu's concern for young students and his benevolent and righteous acts are truly admirable.

Academic Report of Engineering Students

This newspaper received a letter from the Shanghai Engineering College yesterday, along with the transcript of the current semester of the students recommended in the first session. After reviewing, Zheng Ru Ying's overall average score of 84 and conduct grade A are relatively good. Although the rest also passed, it is hoped that they can study harder. As for those who applied for scholarships but dropped out halfway, in order to ensure the proper use of the reader's scholarship, this association will not approve any further applications.

Nanyang Industrial College Sets Up Free Places

The Nanyang Radio Chemical Industry College, located at 132 Lane, Pike Road, sent a letter to this association yesterday, reserving five free places and five half-fee places, and entrusted us to select and recommend students. The deadline for registration is the 24th of this month, and classes will begin immediately. The college is divided into a Fluorescent Lamp Class, an Elementary Radio Repair Class, an Advanced Radio Repair Class, an Amplifier and Broadcasting Machine Repair Class, and a Telecommunications Class. If there are readers who wish to study, please go to the college immediately to obtain detailed regulations, fill out the form, and submit it to this association for investigation and review. We will recommend only these five free places and five half-fee places. First come, first served, and no more will be sent beyond the quota.

### Robbery on Baker Road: Victim Shot and Killed, Police and Robbers in a Deadly Gunfight, One Dead and One Injured, Stray Bullets Injure a Woman and Child

Four robbers suddenly broke into a house with the family name of Mou at No. 17, Lane 344, Baker Road, in the Public Concession at about 3:40 PM yesterday. Two of them were armed with guns, threatening and intimidating. They robbed clothes and other items in national currency, but the exact amount is unknown. When the robbers were robbing, the victim, Mou Jia, resisted bravely and was shot by the robbers. On the spot, the bullet hit his chest.

Immediately, he fell to the ground and died. When the robbers fled with the stolen goods, the surrounding police, having heard the sound, gathered and surrounded them. The robbers scattered like birds and beasts. At this time, two robbers broke into Tongchunfang. Unexpectedly, the lane was a dead end with no way out. The police pursued them relentlessly. The robbers opened fire to resist arrest, and the police returned fire. A gunfight broke out immediately. The bullets were like beads. Both sides fired more than ten shots. On the spot, it was counted that

One Robber Was Killed

Another robber, Wang A Gen, 30 years old, was shot in the shoulder and legs and collapsed. He was arrested and captured and then sent to the police hospital for treatment. When the bullets were flying, Cao Li Shi, a young woman of 22 years old residing at No. 24, Tongchunfang, was shot in the leg by a stray bullet. A girl named Xin Zhen, 7 years old, the daughter of Wu Nonghua, who was playing at the entrance of the lane, was shot in the foot by a bullet. Her family sent her to Guangren Hospital for treatment. It was later learned that the deceased was an ophthalmologist named Tang Bao Shan, 38 years old, who lived at No. 17, Shixiangshouli. He died from gunshot wounds to the right breast and left finger.

### Explosive Thrown at Tian Fa Xie Electric Material Shop

At about 11:15 AM yesterday, an explosive was thrown at Dafaxie Electric Material Shop, No. 385 Route de la Concession in the French Concession. It landed next to the glass showcase on the west side of the entrance and exploded with a loud bang. The glass showcase was immediately blown away in a large square. However, no one was passing by at the time, so no one inside or outside the shop was injured. After receiving the news, the French police quickly dispatched detectives to investigate and found that the explosive was made by Dou, as there were several iron pellets scattered around. The source of the explosive is currently being investigated.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory issued a weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday, stating that Shandong is clear and cold with strong northerly winds.

### Yarn Market Only Knows How to Fight - Rises and Falls - What's the Point?

Yesterday, the yarn market advanced and retreated sharply, with a turbulent situation. Initially, it rose by 160 yuan, declaring a limit up, but then rumors spread, and the floating longs all emerged, suddenly plummeting by 200 yuan in an instant. This violent rise and fall led to some profits, but most suffered losses. It is said that one yarn company has already run aground. The highest price for 20-count Shuangma yarn approached 3,000 yuan, while the lowest price in the black market was 2,790 yuan. In the afternoon, the yarn market declared a limit up after rising to 1,950 yuan in the morning. The exchange temporarily suspended trading to collect margin payments. Trading will resume as usual today. However, at the opening of the exchange, both yarn and cloth showed signs of weakness.

Due to the tense closing situation the previous day, Shuangma opened in the morning with a jump of 90 yuan to 1,880 yuan. However, as soon as this transaction opened, the market situation became turbulent, and it fell slightly to 1,850 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that the exchange's opening of yarn and cloth jumped by more than 100 yuan, and the market suddenly ran wildly, soaring to 2,550 yuan, declaring a limit up. However, the highest price outside the market reached 2,990 yuan to 3,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, at the close of the third transaction, the exchange suddenly fell due to negative news. Floating longs rushed to exit, and the black market plunged to 2,790 yuan. Statistics show that 1,400 bales were traded in half a day.

The futures market for Jin Shuangma experienced a rise, fall, and then a rebound. The market was initially quite strong in the morning. The opening price for November was 2,700 yuan, followed by a rise of 80 yuan. December opened at 2,830 yuan, up 60 yuan. The situation still appeared stable. Shorts were eager to cover, and buyers were firm. The prices of the first two months continued to rise. Later, rumors spread that international negotiations were temporarily suspended, and people's hearts began to fluctuate. Longs were unable to support the market and emerged again. As a result, the opening price for January was lowered by 30 yuan to 1,840 yuan. Subsequently, prices continued to fall and lacked any distinctive features. In the afternoon, due to the limit up of factory orders in the morning, the black market declined sharply, and people's hearts were filled with panic. Large and small investors scrambled to sell, and the selling pressure on the trading floor was strong. Prices for each month fell one after another. The November contract fell to as low as 2,480 yuan, the December contract fell to 2,610 yuan, and the January contract fell to 2,740 yuan at one point. Although prices rebounded slightly later, the near-term contracts ended up with a small rebound of 80 yuan, while the December contract fell by 100 yuan, and the January contract also fell by 110 yuan. The list is as follows:

November December January
Opening 2700.0 2830.0 2840.0
Highest 2780.0 2850.0 2880.0
Lowest 2480.0 2610.0 2740.0
Closing 2540.0 2670.0 2760.0
Change Down 80.0 Down 100.0 Down 110.0

### Spot Cotton on Hold

The spot cotton market was quite expensive in the morning due to the rise in the yarn market. Near noon, the market stopped, as the international situation became chaotic and the yarn price plummeted.

Brazilian Cotton 20 bales 230.0
#2 Family Cotton 150 bales 120.0
Lan Gong Cotton 100 bales 644.0
Again 100 bales 6 -.-.0
Again 100 bales 625.0
Again 100 bales 620.0
Again

The New York cotton market was unstable and varied. Prices rose initially due to buying by the industry and spot traders, followed by a decline due to selling by hedging parties and long liquidations. The close of the market was up two to twelve points, depending on futures.

The Indian cotton market initially declined due to selling by spot traders, but then rebounded due to short covering and buying by European exporters. Closing prices were up or down one or two rupees. It is predicted that the opening of the market today will be down slightly by 0.25 rupees.

### Cotton Cloth Finally Plummets

The market for factory-produced cloth saw a sharp rise at the opening yesterday morning, but then quickly plummeted. In the afternoon, the market gradually stabilized. Sixteen-pound Huadie coarse cloth reached a high of 114.5 yuan, a sharp jump of nearly 10 yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the price first fell back to 99 yuan, and at the close of the market, it was difficult to buy at 101 yuan. As a result, some white coarse and fine cloths fell by 2 to 4 yuan per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloths were flat. Yihe Factory opened with 200 boxes of Golden Pagoda bleached cloth, priced at 110 yuan. The street traded more than 600 pieces of various cloths. Sales to the occupied areas were relatively strong.

Eastern cloth initially saw a continuation of the rising trend due to the soaring price of yarn. Subsequently, negative rumors led to a straight-line plunge. People's hearts were confused and unable to grasp the situation, resulting in a chaotic situation. The Caiqiu Biao cloth at the exchange opened with a rise of 8 or 9 yuan, but the afternoon opening was down 3 yuan compared to the previous day. The closing price rebounded by 1 or 2 yuan. As a result, the current month closed at 91 yuan, down 3.5 yuan; December closed at 94.5 yuan, down 1.5 yuan; and January closed at 97 yuan, unchanged from the previous day. However, the spot market unanimously declined at the close of trading. The leading fine cloth factory orders were at 99.5 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Serge was at 3.625 yuan.

### Black Market Transfers - More Flexibility Reported

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no change in the official rates of the Central Bank and HSBC. The small counter rates of HSBC and other banks were flat. The black market rates for British and American currencies saw a slight expansion. It is rumored that a small number of foreign exchange banks in this city are willing to provide transfer services, but the handling fee is extremely high. Chinese merchants were eager to sell their remaining long positions in American dollars at 2.25 and 3.375 yuan, but there were no consultants. The market trend was loose and cheap, resulting in a lack of imports and no need for foreign firms. Compared to the previous two days, the British were at 2.25 and the Americans were at 3.75. According to unconfirmed rumors, import firms are settling American dollars at 3.75 yuan, while there are still few buyers for foreign exchange transfers between foreign firms importing and exporting in the United States.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds fall by 20 yuan along with the cash price. British gold notes remained unchanged. American gold notes rose to as high as 34.3 yuan in the morning, but then fell back, ending at 33 yuan, down 0.4 yuan compared to the previous day. The trend for Hong Kong notes remained strong, reaching as high as 7.4 yuan in the evening market. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes were slightly weaker, with the former retreating to 3.3 yuan and the latter falling to 3.2 yuan.

Hong Kong, 20th (Thursday) Telegraph: The foreign exchange market opened sluggish this morning. All exchanges remained without honor or disgrace.

Tianjin, 20th (Thursday) Telegraph: The foreign exchange market opened flat this morning. The London and New York exchanges remained without honor or disgrace. There was a market without transactions. Shanghai exchange fell 0.5 yuan to 75 yuan. United banknotes in the black market rose 0.5 yuan to 46 yuan.

### Gold Prices Plummet - Approaching the 18,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's cash gold black market saw an initial rise followed by a sudden and dramatic drop, returning to the 19,000 yuan mark. At one point, it even fell to the 18,000 yuan mark. The mood of all parties shifted abruptly from firm to weak. Around 10:00, news suddenly spread that Japan had softened in US-Japan negotiations, causing a certain atmosphere. Although banks tried to prop up the market, with Da Feng buying 770 taels and Ming Feng buying 580 taels, merchant firms sold 490 taels through Xiang, Xingyong. Xianghe, Shunyuan, and Decheng sold more than 200 taels each. Selling pressure shifted from weak to strong, causing the price to rise to 19,950 yuan and then immediately reverse and plummet. In the afternoon, the price retreated to a low of 18,050 yuan, a drop of 1,900 yuan. As a result, there was some buying activity at the low, briefly pushing the price up by 850 yuan. However, with sentiment still pointing downward, the price fell again, closing down 1,180 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 16,140 taels. The price of gold ornaments fell by 110 yuan to 1,870 yuan.

Cash Gold Rises and Falls Sharply

From the beginning of the morning, the price per bar (10 taels) initially carried the momentum of the previous day and remained firm. The opening price at 9:00 had risen to 19,700 yuan, 170 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. Suddenly, Tianyuan, Shihe, and Zhongxing came to sell, and the price retreated slightly to 19,550 yuan. Defu, Dafeng, Mingfeng, and Decheng scrambled to support the market, and the price gradually rose by 400 yuan. Before 10:00, rumors suddenly arose, and buyers poured in. Xiangxingyong, Xianghe, Decheng, Shunyuan, Shihe, Yongcheng, Tianyuan, and Yifeng aggressively sold off, and the market price fell sharply, entering the 19,000 yuan range, a drop of 1,550 yuan, reaching a low of 18,400 yuan. The noon close was 18,450 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 in the afternoon, 50 yuan lower, at 18,400 yuan. Defu, Yongcheng, Deda, and Decheng forcefully sold off, continuing to fall by 350 yuan, reaching 18,050 yuan. Unexpectedly, Mingfeng, Dafeng, Xianghe, and Hesheng scrambled to advance, immediately rebounding, rising by 650 yuan, reaching 18,700 yuan. Eventually, Yifeng, Xiangxingyong, and Tianyuan sold off, and the price fell again. The closing price at 4:00 was 18,350 yuan, a sharp drop of 1,180 yuan compared to the previous day, with a high and low difference of 1,900 yuan. The listed price of gold at gold shops was 18,500 yuan, with a deduction of 1,000 yuan for purchases.

Ornamental Gold Changes as Many as Eight Times

The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael at Datonghang and Xintonghang rose by 40 yuan to 2,020 yuan. Later, it fell slightly four times, down 140 yuan, to 1,880 yuan. In the afternoon, it initially continued to fall to 1,850 yuan, then rebounded to 1,900 yuan, and finally ended at 1,870 yuan. The price changed as many as eight times in one day, down 110 yuan, with a deduction of 150 yuan for purchases. Silver bullion remained at 26 yuan, with the black market at 23 yuan.

### Public Bonds Sit and Watch the Wind - Foreign Shares Spin Downward

The black market for public bonds changed very quickly yesterday. It fell sharply by more than one yuan in the morning and then rose sharply by more than one yuan in the afternoon. The reason for the decline was mainly the news that the US-Japan talks had stalled. There were too many long positions in the market, leading to a sharp drop. In the afternoon, fresh forces of longs suddenly raised the price, and Class C bonds suddenly broke through the 70 yuan mark. This kind of artificial manipulation cannot last for long, so the closing price remained within the mark. In short, until any news about the US-Japan talks is revealed, neither bullish nor bearish views can be criticized. Therefore, at the slightest price increase, the general blind followers are most easily deceived, and vice versa. Therefore, the market price is not yet on the right track at this time. As for the rumors in this port, they have not subsided but have not been confirmed. In this uncertain and restless situation, it is difficult to make a judgment because it is difficult to predict future rises and falls. Tongyi continued to buy in the morning, and Tongkang also showed interest. Class C initially opened at 9.45 yuan, but as Jiufeng, Tongshun, Dingkang, Runde, and Shengyi increasingly sold off, the market was unable to support the price and broke below 9 yuan, later seeing a small price of 8.4 yuan. The noon close rebounded slightly, but the trend gradually weakened. In the afternoon, Tongyi resumed its buying interest, and Class C bonds suddenly rushed out of the 70 yuan mark, opening at 70.01 yuan. For a time, the market's blind followers thought there was good news and bought in droves. Datong, Hongda, and Runde all bought in, but Tongshun and Jiufeng continued to sell off as always. Lianhe and Yitai were also eager to sell. Class C bonds at 70 yuan ultimately failed to hold their ground. The market price resulted in all bonds, except Class D, being slightly lower by 0.05 yuan, while the rest were good by 0.05 to 0.4 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 2.5 million yuan. A simple table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Change from Previous Day
Class A 76.60 75.00 76.30 Up 0.40
Class B 72.00 70.00 71.45 Up 0.05
Class C 70.30 68.40 69.90 Up 0.15
Class D 65.60 64.80 65.50 Down 0.05
Class E 69.40 67.80 69.30 Up 0.05

Fifty shares of Commercial Press stock were traded at a price of 265 yuan per share.

The public industry stock market remained quiet, and prices rose and fell without fixed rules. The morning opening was very strong. Yihua Yarn Factory, Steel Industry, and others rose by 3 or 4 yuan. After a period of stability, the market finally fell back down. Only steel industry stocks remained at the edge of high prices, and the remaining closing prices did not differ greatly from the previous day.

### Rice Market Stagnation Does Not Hinder - Foreign Flour Also Without Market

The foreign rice market remained stagnant yesterday, with both foreign and domestic rice in short supply. The foreign rice market may come to an end, thus reducing the manipulation of speculators and hoarders. As for the people's food supply, although domestic rice is not reliable, the工部局 Hong Kong rice has increased due to increased foreign exchange, and the 650,000 bags of low-priced goods will be sold publicly, which will inevitably further reduce the public sales price and provide the people with real benefits.

The flour market was also stagnant. American Camp flour completely lacked a market. After the Cereal Association resumed its afternoon meetings the other day, the 久靜思之 people who were active in speculative activities resumed their activities. The goods side became attractive, and blind followers rose up. The market price rose by 2 or 3 yuan. Just as foreign rice was about to be suppressed, the flour has yet to be realized. 客運 was blocked, and the actual cancellation was small. The flour market seemed to be settled, but after speculative hoarding, the market immediately became abnormal. Yesterday, speculation slightly reduced, and those holding goods were reluctant to sell. However, large households were still optimistic because the 平 flour had not arrived. Therefore, it was difficult for the out-of-market price to loosen. Jinlong Bank栈 even had a call price of 423 yuan. Wheat lacked a market, and bran small bags rose to 56 yuan. Orchid guest bran opened at 54 yuan, and buyers waited and watched. The market will be weak in the future.

### Miscellaneous Grains, Oils, and Beans Slightly Flat

Yesterday's speculative trading of edible oil slightly decreased, and market prices have turned flat. As for soybeans, the goods owner sold a few 稍暢, and the price rose by 2 or 3 yuan. Corn initially rose and then fell back. As a result, the spot price was still flat, and the futures price rose by 2 or 3 yuan. The total market sold 20 barrels of Qingdao 生 oil, 30 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 200 dan of Dayou Factory 清油, and 100 dan of rapeseed oil. Rihua Factory sold 100 barrels of rapeseed oil, and Chuannan Factory sold 100 dan of rapeseed oil. Tianjin Chen Jinyuan sold 200 bags, Xin Jinyuan sold 600 bags, and Xinqing bean sold 300 bags. Qingkou and Guide soybean sold 500 bags, and spot corn sold 2,000 bags and 400 tons of futures.

### Sugar Futures Delivery Suspended, Spot Trading Quiet

Yesterday's sugar market was temporarily suspended due to the联营公司 delivering futures. As a result, trading was quiet. Spot prices saw mixed rises and falls. For example, #24 coarse white sugar for October and November initially opened at 272 yuan to 275 yuan, but remained at 272 yuan in the afternoon, only slightly higher by 0.3 yuan. The trend was quite stable. Tai B mark was 244 yuan to 247 yuan, up 22 yuan. DY mark was 228 yuan, up 8 yuan. HX mark was 225 yuan to 222 yuan. The result was up 2 yuan. Hong Kong coarse sugar was 230 yuan, down 2 yuan. Dutch red was 210 yuan to 213 yuan, but finally ended at 208 yuan, up 3 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was only more than 3,000 bags.

### Beware of Shortage in Lake Lotus

There has been a long shortage of Lake Lotus. The bottom reserves have been sold through. However, there are recently 40 pieces, and the color of the goods is good. It is heard that Baochangxing has opened all the進, and the price is 290 yuan. However, the cost of the劃 is already inverted, so there is a fear that there will be a shortage in the future.

### Hardware Market Lingers

The hardware market is showing a state of hesitation. Prices are too high, and sales are sluggish. However, the overseas supply is not continuous, and the bottom reserves in this port are limited. Therefore, the trend of the market is not falling. Black iron billets are also no exception. Yesterday, it still lingered around 10,000 yuan per bundle.

Due to the early interruption of美會司 iron, the only way to meet the market demand is to 僅木街存貨, and the difficulty in purchasing a large number of products is becoming increasingly difficult. Yesterday, each box opened at 1,350 yuan,

### Please Pay Attention to the Residents' Housing

— Mu Chang

Since the工部局 has managed prices, everything has been good, and the citizens have benefited greatly. Under the threat of rising prices, they can finally breathe a sigh of relief. Li De'er, the chief minister of the工部局, said it well: "The Equalization Association has shown sympathetic attention to supplying Shanghai with the main items, so the public can rest assured... The Equalization Association does not intend to supply foreign exchange for luxury goods, but the工部局 is confident that the Association will be able to supply foreign exchange for all the items necessary for the lives of Chinese and foreign residents in this port." The first batch of item price limits has been announced, and the second batch will be announced next week. The residents are deeply looking forward to it because of the urgent need for life. People in general have not had any contact with luxury goods for a long time, what they need are the minimum and indispensable items for their life.

The authorities first lowered its giant hammer for food; then, step by step, they continued to limit the prices of necessities, and their steps can be said to be essential. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the necessities of life, and food is especially important, but housing is also in a major position. Therefore, in this occasion, it is not too much to propose the serious housing problem in Shanghai in order to seek a reasonable solution.

The citizens have been suffering from the "housing" problem for a long time. It can be said that it is painful to talk about it. The big landlords and the second landlords are in charge, and the third-rate tenants are the most miserable oppressed. This journal published their voices a few days ago, and if you don't think it is miserable and serious, then this person is a superman.

If you have several buildings of your own, you can hoard all the goods just like the National Army rice. Wherever there is profit, you will spare no effort to scrape the tenants' heads in various ways. Prices fall due to restrictions, but rents have soared, and things have been smooth sailing, 40% and then 50%, which is a geometric progression. As long as a written or oral notice is issued, the tenants have to obey. There are even various tricks of "selling houses separately," "the contract expires," "the property rights are transferred," and "foreign exchange settlement" to make people get into their traps. The second landlords take advantage of the situation and intensify their efforts. If others increase the rent by 50%, they will increase it by 60% or 70%, and the utility bills will also have to be added. They enjoy their profits by playing the tiger's skin. Of course, not all of them are crows, but how many people can have legitimate reasons to calculate and apportion in proportion? Moreover, for the sake of "necessity," the second landlord's wife is also a tigress. Whether you like it or not, you have to laugh and cry and be under her jurisdiction. Walking under her eaves, you have no choice but to bow your head. In the pavilions and in the kitchen rooms, the tenants in the upper floors mostly endure their anger in order to calm things down, so the landlords' power has grown even more.

Years ago, when the National Army was stationed, it abolished small rents and restricted rents in order to benefit the people; after the war, the authorities in the concession also published a draft of the rental regulations to kill the fierce flame; unfortunately, the latter was discussed but not implemented, and had no impact. Recently, lowering electricity fees and land taxes was a good phenomenon, but it was a good opportunity for the landlords to "吞," and the third-rate tenants did not benefit from it.

"Low palace rooms and do our best in the ditches," "Virtue is not alone, there must be neighbors," I hope that the concession authorities will have the same serious expression on the housing problem of the citizens as on the prices of daily necessities, then the beneficiaries will not only be two or three people.

### Solving Shanghai's Severe Housing Problem: Hoping for the Swift Formation of a "Rent Evaluation Committee"

— A Citizen

Before the war, renting a house from a major landlord cost about 40 to 50 yuan for a larger one, and about 20 to 30 yuan for a smaller one. Now, major landlords are increasing rents for secondary landlords, but perhaps not as frequently as secondary landlords increase rents for tertiary tenants, which, when added up, should not exceed double the pre-war price. Now, secondary landlords, renting houses for several tens of yuan each, sublet them to tertiary tenants, earning ten to twenty times more in rent. They don't even pay rent for their own housing. Currently, the desires of secondary landlords are increasing daily, blaming rent increases by major landlords, water price hikes, electricity price increases, etc., using all sorts of excuses to raise prices in disguise. This is because the price increases are not proportional to the increased costs.

In light of the soaring prices, the two concessions have taken measures to control prices, especially selling foreign rice at a fixed price, which has greatly benefited ordinary people and had a deterrent effect on profiteers. However, these tangible profiteers are easily detected by the authorities, while the poisonous flames of secondary landlords are deeply hidden in every corner, with over 90% of people feeling their pain! Now, we are issuing a weak call, hoping to achieve the greatest effect, urging the authorities of the two concessions to jointly suppress these intangible housing profiteers. (Editor's Note: The French Concession authorities previously published a draft rental charter, but it was never implemented.)

Recently, foreign residents in Shanghai have made suggestions to deal with major landlords raising rents, and some Chinese even suggested forming a tertiary tenant union, but none of these have materialized. Now, we ask the authorities of the two concessions to relieve the suffering of millions of citizens by quickly establishing a "Temporary Rent Evaluation Committee." Its nature is temporary, and the final executing body should still be the courts.

Regarding the structure of the "Temporary Rent Evaluation Committee," the income of secondary landlords from subletting should not exceed double their cost (including the proportion of their own residence). (Editor's Note: This proposal is extremely moderate.) The committee's procedures should be that it does not act without a complaint, handles everything by order, and asks the courts to enforce it. Conduct housing surveys to prevent useful housing from being left vacant due to rent reductions, forcing it to be rented out. If a tertiary tenant complains to the committee about rent reductions or preventing rent increases and eviction, the committee should immediately investigate, conduct a fair evaluation, and if the party is not satisfied, send it to the courts for enforcement. Major landlords who want to increase rent must also obtain the approval of the evaluation committee.

The above measures are just a principle. As for detailed, beneficial, legal, customary, and factual regulations for tertiary tenants, we hope that the authorities will accept, adopt, and implement them, which will definitely achieve our expected goal of solving the most severe housing problem in Shanghai today. We are all sincerely praying for it. (Que Chou)

### How to Prevent Tuberculosis in Infants and Toddlers

— Di Qing

In addition to protecting body temperature, clothing should be as light as possible. Overly warm cotton wool, flannel, and similar materials are not necessarily good, as these clothes can hinder a child's respiratory function.

Breastfeeding: In the first few months of a child's life, breastfeeding by a healthy mother is the most important and beneficial. If the mother has tuberculosis, she is not suitable for breastfeeding. To avoid the mother's cough and saliva transmitting the disease, it is naturally appropriate to hire a healthy wet nurse.

For breastfed babies, milk or milk powder should always be the main food every day. Gradually introduce rice cereal or other foods. It is also necessary to regularly drink orange juice, and a small amount of cod liver oil daily can enhance their resistance to germs.

Children often dislike eating vegetables, which is a pity. Because fresh vegetables, lettuce, and carrots, etc., contain extremely valuable protective substances. In particular, foods that mix delicious fruits and vegetables are most beneficial. A pint of milk a day is also essential. However, it must be tuberculosis-tested or pasteurized before being consumed regularly. White cheese, cottage cheese, and milk biscuits made from clean milk are also extremely beneficial.

When infectious diseases such as measles and whooping cough occur, children must undergo strict physical examinations. Some people often say, "Measles are inevitable for children. It's best to have had it before starting school." This is a big mistake. Older children who get measles have a milder case than infants. Therefore, we should do our best to protect children from contracting these diseases. After contracting these diseases, we should pay close attention to care. Because during the recovery period from measles, there is the greatest risk of tuberculosis starting.

After starting school: Nowadays, most children go to kindergarten from a young age, and even children under the age of five go to kindergarten classes. Kindergarten classes are often outdoors and have long periods of rest every day.

During this period, or send them to the Welfare Clinic, where the doctor will tell you what special nutritional attention the child should pay, dietary clothing and any special difficulties. This opportunity can fully understand how toddlers can get sick, how can they be cured quickly without wasting time.

The severity of tuberculosis in young children is lower than that in older children, but the germs can lurk at this time. It is best to examine them early, diagnose them by a doctor, and prevent or treat them early.

If there are symptoms of particularly poor health, of course, you should consult a doctor or go to the Welfare Clinic for examination. Enlarged neck glands, fever, pale complexion, or loss of appetite all indicate that special examination should be given, and do not be careless. (End)

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Fourteen: The Life of a Hero

"Look at you, you really look pitiful, but tonight is too unlucky, two people have already taken leave, if you want to rest, you can only wait until tomorrow!" He took a felt hat off the wall and put it on his head, and then said a particularly kind word. "Since that's the case, when it's time to turn over the tiger boat, you don't have to go up!"

This was certainly a great favor.

Begonia nodded repeatedly, but couldn't help coughing violently.

For the past few days, he himself didn't know why, it wasn't cold, and he hadn't been exposed to the cold at night, but suddenly he started coughing; and he coughed very badly. When he returned from the theater at night, as soon as his head hit the pillow, he couldn't breathe, and he had to cough for at least half an hour before he could barely fall asleep. But when he slept until eight or nine in the morning, he was awakened by the turbid air suffocating in his bronchial tubes, which made him cough so much that he couldn't lie in bed. No matter how tired he was, he couldn't struggle to get up.

"Dad, you should see a doctor!" Mei Bao had told him this several times. And she had also listened to the guidance of other residents, making her father almond milk soup and rock sugar stewed pears, etc., cough medicines, but Begonia ate them, and they had no effect. (268)

The Entertainment World

### The Ancestor of Motion Pictures

— Zhi Yu

Undeniably, motion pictures are the most developed form of drama in the entertainment world of the 20th century. People probably all know that this was invented by foreigners! But who knows that shadow plays already existed in our country during the Northern Song Dynasty? (See Meng Yuanlao's "Tokyo Dream Record" and Wu Zimu's "Dream Liang Record" from the Southern Song Dynasty.)

Mr. Gu Jiegang once wrote an article on Australian shadow plays, and Mr. Jiang Danian also wanted to write a book on Changqiao shadow plays. They all wanted to promote and enhance China's inherent art and culture. I dare not have any such dreams, I just want to write about some of the interesting things about the shadow plays of our ancient times—which can also be said to be the ancestors of shadow plays—for people who like to study shadow plays to refer to.

Westerners say that shadow plays evolved from zoetropes, which is not without reason. Our ancient shadow plays were invented using the principle of the zoetrope.

The most important part of ancient shadow plays was a donkey's skin, which was ground very thin, almost transparent. People, horses, dogs... were painted on the skin, which was considered the negative. Behind the skin was a very bright oil lamp—although not as bright as the thousands of light electric lamps of today, it was similar to a hundred-light lamp. About ten feet away from the donkey skin, a white cloth screen was hung, which was the so-called silver screen. In this way, the paintings on the donkey skin would be reflected on the white screen, and the donkey skin could be moved, so the images on the screen would also move. This seems similar to modern cartoons; really, it's almost the same!

Moreover, this kind of shadow play also had sound. There was a singer who stood next to the screen and sang or spoke according to the characters in the play (male, female, painted face, clown).

If you think what I'm saying is too absurd, then I can tell you that the British Museum in London still displays the donkey skin and oil lamps used to make shadow plays in our country during the Northern Song Dynasty..., but it seems that Chinese museums do not have this kind of antique.

### Yan Jun and Mei Cun: A Balance of Strength and Softness

— Wen

Well-known actors Yan Jun and Mei Cun held their wedding ceremony on the 18th of this month at D.D.S. The witnesses were lawyer Wang Hongmo and famous director Wang Zuolin. The ceremony was solemn and simple, truly worthy of emulation by those who follow. It is now scheduled to host a banquet at the Hatton Building at 5:00 p.m. today (the 21st), with guests mostly cultural figures and theater workers. There will be a grand occasion. Based on what I know, I will briefly discuss the history of Yan and Mei below:

Yan Jun, originally named Yan Zongqi, is more stubborn in nature. He is a progressive artist with integrity. He has been in Shanghai from the north for several years. Among today's Shanghai drama actors, he can be considered a veteran. After performing in the two dramas "Wu Sangui" and "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom," his acting skills won unanimous praise, and the name Yan Jun was deeply rooted in the minds of every audience. From the Fifth Master in "Home" and Commissioner Yang in "Border Town Story," we know that he can play various different personalities. He is honest, his mother was originally in Tianjin, and she has recently been brought to Shanghai. He is very filial. He is also very affectionate to his younger siblings. He does not have all the bad habits of "so-called artists" nowadays. Indeed, Yan Jun is an artist worthy of our admiration.

Mei Cun is famous for playing strange flower roles. However, his original attitude to people is not strange at all, the word "gentle" can represent her personality. She and Yan Jun have known and loved each other for several years, it is by no means a blitzkrieg tactic. Her personality is gentle and Yan Jun's temperament is just stubborn. Using gentleness to overcome strength, or in other words, balancing leniency and strictness, I think their future happiness is solid and unlimited. Finally, we hope that they will continue to work hard as always and not let us down!

Chapter 19: Dusk: Nomadic Cavalry Fill the City with Dust

Li Chuang allowed him to go into battle, and taught Li Yan and other four generals to chase straight after them, wanting to stir up the flow of the bandit's formation, so that he could show off his bravery. But he saw many more bandit generals coming towards him, and the one sitting on horseback at the front was Liu Zongmin, with a broadsword across his hands, shouting loudly. Zhang Cangqiu laughed wildly, his sword like a long rainbow, his horse like a swimming dragon, and went straight for Liu Zongmin. But Liu Zongmin's sword was also not weak, and he cheered up his spirit and fought Zhang Cangqiu fiercely. Li Yan came to help, and Chen Qiu fought with him. The bandit generals saw that the two were extremely brave and feared that Liu and Li would be frustrated, so everyone raised their weapons and went forward to help. Chen Cangqiu and Chen Fei fought bravely and did not retreat at all. Xu Jing and Liu Yinying, under Bai Xianzong's military banner, watched from afar as Zhang Cangqiu and others were killing generals and showing off their abilities on the battlefield, and they were extremely excited. They immediately asked Bai Xianzong for orders, and then led hundreds of cavalrymen to charge into Li Chuang's formation. Xu Jing was riding a silver-maned horse and wielding a gleaming silver spear. Liu Yinying was riding a jujube-colored horse and wielding a pear blossom ancient spear. When they reached the front of the formation, Li Chuang ordered the bandit general Fan Damaizi and others to go forward to meet them. Xu Jing saw the bandits on the opposite side and was eager to make a contribution, so he rushed forward. Fan Damaizi waved the double hammers in his hand and fought fiercely with Xu Jing. Liu Yinying galloped forward, took a gap, and thrust out with his spear, and Fan Damaizi had already fallen off his horse. At this time, Zhang Cangqiu had already killed a bandit general. Wu Sangui was overjoyed to see them so brave. The generals such as Chai Ying saw this and were eager to try. (224)
