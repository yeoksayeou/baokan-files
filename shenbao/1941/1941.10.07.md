Chongqing: It is reported that after heavily damaging the Japanese forces, the Central Army withdrew from Zhengzhou on the evening of the 4th. The battle was bloody, and the Japanese suffered extremely heavy casualties. (United Press report, 6th)

Chongqing: Today, the Chinese side's communique acknowledges that the Chinese army has abandoned Zhengzhou. It states that the defending forces of Zhengzhou have made an orderly retreat and are holding new positions near Zhengzhou, continuing to engage the Japanese forces. The Japanese forces entered Zhengzhou from the northeast and southeast at noon on Friday. The Chinese rearguard fought the Japanese in street battles within the city for several hours. The strength of the Japanese forces around Zhengzhou is estimated at over 30,000, supported by 100 aircraft and 70-80 tanks. The forces that entered Zhengzhou were from the central Japanese column, and their cost was 2,500 dead and wounded. The losses on the left and right flanks of the Japanese are equal to those of the central column. Currently, the Japanese left flank is being held up at Rongze, a city less than 20 kilometers northwest of Zhengzhou. Their right flank is currently being fiercely fought by the Chinese army southeast of Zhengzhou. There was no new news from the Xiangbei front yesterday, only a short telegram stating that the Chinese army has successfully dealt with the Japanese forces landing north of Xiangyin from Dongting Lake. At the same time, general speculation that the Chinese army was about to launch a major offensive in Yichang seems to have been answered by a semi-official announcement, stating that during the week starting September 27, while the great battle for Changsha was in progress, the Chinese forces in Yichang, Xinyang, and Suixian attacked resolutely to contain the Japanese forces. Now that the Japanese have retreated from Xiangbei, the battles in the aforementioned areas can be considered to have achieved their purpose. (Reuters report, 6th)

Chongqing: Fierce fighting is taking place in the suburbs of Zhengzhou. The main force of the Japanese troops that broke into the city has been almost completely wiped out. The Chinese army launched a fierce counteroffensive yesterday. The authorities have also mobilized fresh troops stationed in central Shaanxi to rush to the front lines to fight. After the Japanese forces were fiercely counterattacked by various Chinese units yesterday evening, their momentum was blunted and they were unable to advance further. The Chinese army on the western section of the Longhai Railway has completed a pincer encirclement and is now waiting for the Japanese cavalry to stray in and be annihilated. The military authorities here believe that the battle situation in central Henan will develop rapidly within days, and the Chinese army will not allow the Japanese forces to gain an inch anywhere.

### Chongqing's Direct Tax Revenue Continues to Increase Sharply

Chongqing: According to sources, direct tax revenue continues to increase sharply. The budget for Chongqing City this year is 25 million yuan, but 45 million yuan has already been collected. It will not be difficult to reach 60 million yuan by the end of the year. However, given the current vibrant state of commerce and finance, tax revenue should far exceed this figure. The problem is that silver, money, commercial, and industrial sectors are still trying to evade taxes, and the general public has not developed the habit of automatically filing and paying income taxes.

### Standard of Living and Production Problems

From the very beginning of humankind, driven by hunger, they sought food. In the initial chaos, they ate raw meat and drank blood. Suiren taught people to cook, and Youchao built shelters. Life thus changed, and everything necessary for daily life was prepared. Considering our nation's customs and morals over thousands of years, we have advocated simplicity and frugality. When living is simple, national strength is conserved. "A gentleman does not seek satiety in food" is an ancient maxim. Yan Hui's single basket of food and gourd of water are respected as a teacher's model. If there are starving people on the roads while the stables have fat horses, it is akin to "leading beasts to devour men," cutting oneself off from humanity. This was at that time a vigorous effort to share wealth and poverty, happiness and hardship, and to encourage each other to cultivate simple living. It is all very clear.

Our country's civilization developed early, but the simplification of living stands in stark contrast to the splendid material civilization of the West. No wonder we are often seen as the enigma of the East. Considering the frequency of internal and external disasters throughout history, as well as the backwardness of production and the exhaustion of the economy, the ability of the people to maintain their livelihoods and the nation to thrive can be attributed to a simple life. Although production is low, consumption does not increase drastically. Compared to the West's increasing production and expanding consumption, the methods may be different, but the results may not be very different. How can we ignore this?

Since the opening of our country's sea ban and the communication between Eastern and Western cultures, our nation's standard of living has suddenly presented a serious economic problem. Our country's low standard of living first compensated for our backward production, and now it supports the high costs of enterprises. Although all costs are high, the level of labor compensation remains low. It is no exaggeration to say that today's factories can only make a small profit from the labor of workers. Abroad, our people's low standard of living has made a significant contribution. Whether in the New World or on the battlefields, everything from building roads and mining to farming and planting has been marked by the achievements of our low-cost laborers.

However, as things have changed, our low-wage laborers have been seen as thorns in the side, and have suffered the exclusion and jealousy of other nations. Just as our people are about to improve their lives, they are met with unexpected obstacles and complications. Where should our standard of living stand? We truly feel torn and at a loss.

The nation that suffers the most from a low standard of living in today's world is the Indian people. The success of the British Industrial Revolution reflects the lowering of the Indian people's standard of living, which is a well-known fact. The more developed the industry in India, the more expanded the production, the lower the standard of living, and the more serious the economic oppression. This progress of production and the pain of living go hand in hand, which is truly the most serious defect in the modern economic structure.

In recent years, the material progress and the pain of living in our country have also become directly proportional, and Shanghai is the most obvious example. If capitalist countries can still use our country's low-wage laborers, our people's living oppression will be even more unbearable. When things reach an extreme, they will reverse. Our low standard of living is suddenly seen as harmful to the standard of living in the West. At the same time, they sincerely hope to improve our people's lives to open up international lines between East and West. This is undoubtedly good news for our people. In the progress of modern civilization, our people cannot continue to endure the pain of a low standard of living for long, and we must improve our standard of living and promote production efficiency in parallel, so that we can reach the realm of true production.

The most affected object of our low standard of living is naturally the United States, because the political and economic relationship between the two countries will inevitably be historically maintained. In the past, they hated our low-wage laborers and the products manufactured by low-wage laborers, and specially built high tariff fortresses or issued immigration regulations to resist them, but now they have all been thrown to the winds. The reason is that our people need their industrial products very much, and they also hope to maintain China's market in the Far East, and today's problem is how to realize this transaction! The answer to this question is very easy, that is, if our people have purchasing power or productivity, it will be easily solved. But from the actual situation, in order to obtain this purchasing power or productivity, we must first improve the standard of living of laborers. This is what the Americans hope for, and the British are also calling for it. The problem of production and the standard of living in various countries in the post-war recovery process will be a serious turning point. Mr. Blanc's book "The American Economy and the Standard of Living" describes it in detail. Our goal is to introduce and clarify it.

### End of Anglo-American Military Conference, Radford Flies Back to Singapore, Situation Severe in the Pacific, Philippine Defense Bill to Pass Soon

United Press International, Manila, 6th – Marshal Radford, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Forces, and his entourage departed by plane this morning for Singapore. The conference held over several days has concluded. U.S. Army authorities deem it extremely satisfactory. Officials state that this conference provided an opportunity to express shared opinions on matters of common interest.

United Press International, Manila, 6th – Air Vice-Marshal Radford, also Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Forces, is scheduled to fly to Singapore today, marking the conclusion of the conference held here. It is widely believed that this conference sufficiently demonstrates that defense leaders from both Britain and the United States recognize the severity of the situation. Since Radford and U.S. Chief Military Representative to Chongqing, Magruder, arrived here, general confidence in the Philippines has increased. It is generally believed that, should war break out, the Philippines will certainly not be abandoned by Britain and the United States. Radford was invited by top defense and political leaders of the U.S. and the Philippines yesterday to lunch together, which drew considerable attention. The "Manila Bulletin" published an editorial yesterday that reflects the views of Americans here, stating, "Since Marshal Radford's arrival, progress has been made in the cooperation and strengthening of Pacific defenses, and all related issues. This cooperation problem does not only represent Britain, Radford himself exceeds the authority of the British Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. He is a policy maker, and his authority is not limited to the British side. The arrival of this senior official is to build our wisdom and confidence."

United Press International, Washington, 6th – The House Insular Affairs Committee began hearings on the Philippine defense bill today, aiming to reach a decision between $55,000,000 and $59,000,000. Qualified observers claim that, barring unforeseen events, the bill should pass quickly. U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Francis B. Sayre, will deliver a speech today on behalf of the Philippine government in favor of the bill. War Department officials will also attend and deliver speeches. The bill has received the full support of both the U.S. and Philippine governments. It is also reported that the current unstable situation in the Pacific is conducive to the early passage of this measure.

### Most U.S. Senators Favor Repealing Neutrality Act, Roosevelt Invites Leaders for Consultation

Havas, Washington, 5th – According to informed sources here, a powerful figure in the government stated this month that President Roosevelt is scheduled to convene five senators on the 7th to discuss repealing the Neutrality Act. It is almost certain that three of them favor the immediate repeal of all restrictive measures in the Act. They are likely to be Senate Majority Leader Barkley, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally, and Republican Senator Austin, all of whom have publicly supported lifting the ban on arming merchant ships and sailing into war zones. However, of the remaining two, Senate Finance Committee Chairman George favors arming merchant ships but opposes sailing into war zones, while Senate Minority Leader McNary opposes any major changes to the current Neutrality Act. Representative Bloom, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, will also be invited to attend and listen. It is said that he also favors repealing all restrictive measures contained in the Neutrality Act. In short, Roosevelt's proclaimed policy of freedom of the seas is increasingly gaining popular support. It is widely believed that powerful senators in the majority will urge the President to take advantage of this situation to proceed with repealing the Neutrality Act. The sinking of the U.S. oil tanker "White" has further strengthened the position of these senators. However, it seems that the President currently seeks nothing more than the authority to arm merchant ships. According to preliminary Senate voting results, there will likely be about 20 senators opposing any proposed amendment to the Neutrality Act. These individuals may use "delaying" tactics to prevent the Senate from passing the government's proposed amendment, at least delaying the vote for several weeks. Prominent isolationist Senator Nye publicly declared today that the opposition will strongly oppose the government's arming of merchant ships, and will not allow even a partial repeal of neutrality. It is said that the current issue is Congress's policy on the President's order for the fleet to shoot enemy ships upon sight in American waters. This is our retaliation.

### Twenty U.S. Ships to be Armed, Only Three Crew Members Missing from "White"

Haitong News Agency, New York, 6th – According to a representative of the U.S. Maritime Commission the day before yesterday, 12 to 20 U.S. ships flying the Panamanian flag and serving the British have already been equipped with cannons. Other ships will also be armed in the same way to navigate war zones.

Reuters, New York, 6th – The New Jersey Standard Company received a radio message from Captain Mayrho of the U.S. oil tanker "White" stating that, after the oil tanker was sunk by a torpedo, only three crew members were missing, and 34 were rescued. The ship was 500 miles southeast of Recife, the capital of Pernambuco, Brazil, at 1:15 AM on September 27th.

### U.S. Should Uphold Far East Policy, Grew Speaks Upon Return to U.S.

International News Service, San Francisco, 6th – Former U.S. Minister to Thailand, Grew, arrived here yesterday and will proceed to Washington to report to President Roosevelt and the State Department. In a meeting with reporters, Grew warned the American people not to be deceived by the subtle caution hidden within Japan's policies. He stated that Japan is "determined" to continue promoting its "New Order" movement in East Asia. Therefore, "if the United States wants to maintain its position in the Far East, it must uphold its policies." It is noted that Grew resigned from his post as Minister to Thailand not long after the State Department agreed. Grew stated that certain events detrimental to the United States forced his resignation, thus his resignation is seen as mysterious.

### Netherlands East Indies Official Responds to Ishii, Supplies Must be Shipped to USSR Because of Soviet War Against Germany

United Press International, Batavia, 6th – Officials yesterday responded to the Japanese government spokesman's claim that the Netherlands East Indies' shipment of rubber to the Soviet Union was an unfriendly act, stating that the shipment of goods from the Netherlands East Indies to the Soviet Union is simply an inevitable result of the Soviet Union's war against Germany. Officials believe that this position will be maintained, even if Ishii, Deputy Spokesman of the Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau, is correct in his interpretation of the Japanese government's views. Authoritative sources stated that Dutch policy has recently been clearly explained by Gerbrandy in a radio broadcast, stating that although there is no relationship between the Netherlands East Indies and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union is the latest victim of Hitler's aggression. Therefore, the Netherlands East Indies' rubber, tin, salt, and other products will be available for use by the Soviet Union.

United Press International, Tokyo, 6th – Kokumin Shimbun criticized the Netherlands East Indies today, saying that the Netherlands East Indies' refusal to transport supplies that it refused to ship to Japan to the Soviet Union is "ignoring Japan's friendly attitude and an arrogant response to Ishii's statement."

### Iceland's Population Surge

United Press International, Reykjavik, 6th – Iceland's population has increased significantly since British and American troops were stationed there. Iceland's original population was 120,000, and the number of British and American troops stationed there is about two-thirds of Iceland's original population. Therefore, Iceland's situation has reached unprecedented prosperity. Due to the increase in population and the prosperity of the market, social problems have also arisen. The value of food, clothing, and other items has soared by 150% to 200%. Hotels and houses are fully booked for up to a year. However, Iceland's unemployment problem has been solved as a result. A U.S. Navy officer stationed in Reykjavik told reporters that he waited two weeks after arriving in Iceland to rent a room in a hotel. Many farmers from the nearby Faroe Islands come here to help build roads, finding it more profitable than working in the fields in their hometown. These roads are funded by the British. All stores are full of harvest goods. Icelandic people and military officials stationed in Reykjavik are currently working hard to find a solution to accommodate the remaining 80,000 soldiers who have not yet been housed or have access to basic amenities. Even in Reykjavik, the entire city has only two cinemas, which are usually very crowded, and individual soldiers rarely have the opportunity to enter and watch a movie. There is also only one swimming pool, which can only accommodate a small number of people.

### Southern Ireland Prime Minister Warns People Not to Relax Vigilance

Reuters, Dublin, 6th – Southern Ireland Prime Minister de Valera, speaking at the conclusion of a local defense forces exercise in Mullingar yesterday, warned the people of Southern Ireland not to relax their vigilance because the main battlefield has shifted elsewhere, saying that major powers rarely show consideration for smaller countries in their path of advance. So far, Southern Ireland's major rights have been respected. In my opinion, it should be acknowledged that Britain, the belligerent nation closest to us, has not acted inappropriately at the urging of some propagandists. The Irish people do not want to be dominated by their former masters, nor do they want to be governed by new ones. The only possible path we have chosen is fraught with difficulties. Now that the main battlefield has shifted, the people of Southern Ireland are in danger of acting unwisely or reducing their vigilance. If this danger continues, it is related to our very survival. Vigilance cannot be relaxed, because the war continues and our danger will inevitably increase.

### German Air Force No Longer Maintains Superiority on All Fronts, Monthly Losses Exceed Production, Losses of Aircrew Are Especially Serious

Reuters, London, 6th – Some aviation experts in London, based on the American estimate of 2,500 German aircraft produced monthly and the Soviet claim of shooting down German aircraft on the Eastern Front, have reached a conclusion that the number of aircraft lost by the Germans on all battlefields each month may exceed their monthly production by about 300. British Prime Minister Churchill's mention in the House of Commons last week of the German shortage of aircraft may be evidence of this. The most important question is how long the Germans can withstand this difference between losses and production without seriously hindering the strength of their air force. It is widely believed that the German Air Force's second line, the reserves, is quite large, but a large number of reserves must now be deployed to make up for the difference between their losses and production. If the above figures are correct, then the German Air Force still maintains its full combat strength, but if the current loss rate continues unabated and the reserves are deployed, the Germans will eventually encounter difficulties. The combined aircraft production of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States is about 6,000 aircraft per month. There have been various interpretations of Churchill's mention of the German aircraft shortage in the House of Commons last Tuesday, and newspapers have also published many articles written by British aviation experts. Their opinions can be summarized as follows: since the outbreak of the war, the Germans have used the vast power of their air force to bring various European countries to their knees, but in the Battle of Britain, the British Air Force has proved that the number of German Air Force aircraft is very large, but not all-powerful. Now, Churchill has mentioned for the first time that the number of German aircraft is no longer vast. It would be rash to say that the German Air Force has become greatly weakened. The German Air Force is still strong today, but several points can be considered. The war has spread to the Middle East and the Soviet Union, and the German Air Force must have exhausted its combat capability to the maximum extent. The loss of well-trained pilots and aircrew is more serious than the loss of aircraft. According to the British Air Ministry, the Germans lost 8,020 aircraft in the first two years of the war. In addition, their losses in the Soviet Union have also been very significant. Estimates vary, but it is believed to be at least between 2,500 and 3,000 aircraft. The German Air Force has suffered heavy losses in both manpower and aircraft, and must operate in a vast area to maintain consistency in the war. Now Germany must maintain a 2,000-mile-long line from northern Norway to Poland, while concentrating its main forces on a 1,500-mile-long Soviet front, and must also have fighter planes in the country for protection, and assist the Italian army in Libya, maintain the occupation of Greece and the islands, and continue to attack British ships in the Atlantic. When the war first started, the German Air Force was extremely large, but the magnitude of the duties it currently undertakes is far beyond what was initially expected. Therefore, it is expected that if the Germans lose aircraft and aircrew on the current scale, they will not be able to maintain general air superiority for many more weeks. In short, the Soviet war has degraded both the quality and quantity of the German Air Force, and it is no longer able to maintain superiority simultaneously on all fronts, because the German attack on the Soviet Union has given Britain the opportunity to establish air superiority.

### German Aircraft Raids on Britain Have Decreased, British Air Force Attacks Important Military Targets in Italy

Reuters, London, 6th – Dive-bombing attacks by the Germans have greatly decreased recently in the shipping lanes of the North Sea, which are part of the East Coast convoy routes and are known for German submarine activity. A captain who has traveled this route many times stated that dive bombers used to wreak havoc on the East Coast, but they have not been seen much recently. This cannot but be thanks to the Soviet Union.

Reuters, Cairo, 6th – The Middle East Gazette stated that on Friday, the British Air Force bombed an important railway intersection, a mine factory, and an ammunition factory in Marina di Catanzaro, southern Italy, at low altitude. All targets were hit by heavy bombs and severely damaged. A train of supply cars parked at the intersection was also strafed. In addition, the port of Bardia in North Africa and nearby military targets were heavily bombed by British aircraft for three consecutive nights. A squadron of North and South aircraft participated in these bombings and attacked enemy camps near Solum. British fighters repeatedly flew out to reconnoiter or patrol throughout the week, but only encountered enemy aircraft in skirmishes on several occasions, none of which were decisive. Only one of the British aircraft dispatched did not return.

Reuters, London, 6th – Last week, the British Air Force shot down three German aircraft in Soviet territory. No British aircraft were lost in the defense of Britain, and four German bombers were shot down. When the British Air Force attacked the Western European front, it shot down 11 enemy fighters. 30 British bombers and fighters were also lost. In the Middle East, four Axis aircraft were destroyed and several others damaged. 13 British aircraft also did not return. The British Navy shot down one enemy aircraft.

Klapka Suddenly Executed

Havas, Swiss Capital, 5th – Dr. Klapka, the former mayor of Prague, was sentenced to death by the Prague People's Court on the 2nd of this month and was executed by firing squad in Bohemia and Moravia today. Klapka testified when the Czech Prime Minister Elias was put on trial by the People's Court. It is still questionable whether Elias was executed, as one of Elias's crimes was knowing that Klapka had embezzled two million crowns (Czech currency) of public funds and not interfering. These public funds were related to a relief fund used to assist the families of Czech dignitaries who went to Britain to support the Benes government, or to help them flee to Britain and engage in political activities. When questioned about this, Klapka only admitted to embezzling public funds, but firmly denied using them to assist dignitaries fleeing abroad.

### A Terrifying Act Occurs in Romania

### Disagreement Over British-German Exchange of Wounded Soldiers; Senior Members of Three British Cabinet Departments Meet to Discuss the Matter

Reuters, New York, 6th - There is still disagreement in Berlin regarding the exchange of wounded soldiers. According to the latest news, the repeatedly delayed exchange of wounded soldiers plan will not be implemented until tonight at the earliest. London stated last night that the ships carrying wounded soldiers could not depart before Sunday. Negotiations are still ongoing. On Saturday, the British government issued a final notice to the German government, stating that if the matter was not resolved by Sunday morning, the wounded German soldiers on the ship would have to be moved ashore. However, the wounded soldiers had not yet left the ship yesterday, presumably because Germany had given a response that allowed for a slight extension of this final notice. The back-and-forth communication between Britain and Germany takes a considerable amount of time, which is clearly a factor contributing to the delay. Yesterday, the British Sea, Land, and Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting that lasted a long time. The wounded men on the ship, under the surveillance of armed guards, took walks on the pier. Military personnel here are in constant contact with the Army Department. It has been learned that the executive branch has proposed that some detained German women should be repatriated at the same time as the wounded soldiers, which the British government has agreed to.

Rumor of German Demand for Hess's Release

### The Situation on the Southwestern Front for the Red Army Is Improving Daily; Repulsed Romanian Troops and Recaptured More Than Thirty Places; German Troops in Leningrad Suffer Heavy Losses

Reuters, Moscow, 6th - A special correspondent for "Pravda" detailed the battle situation, indicating that the situation for the Soviet army in a certain area on the southwestern front is now greatly improved. It is claimed that the continuous counter-attacks by the Soviet army have been quite successful. In the past three days, they have recaptured thirty inhabited areas from the Romanian and German troops. The front line in this decisive war is not fixed on a straight line. The situation in the front-line area in this area is now also greatly improved, as the movement of refugees has come to an end, and activities on the roads and everywhere are indeed adapting to the needs of the war effort. The people in various places are excited to see the large number of enemy soldiers captured. The Romanian troops invading the "B" area have now been cleared out. The staff officers of the Romanian divisions have either been killed or captured, and all the Romanian war equipment has been seized by the Soviet army. The Soviet army also attacked and recovered the "R" village occupied by the German army from the rear and sides. When the Soviet army conquered the "M" village, many Romanian troops were annihilated. In another area, the Soviet army defended a certain bridge to resist a Hungarian regiment, two companies of which have been annihilated by the Soviet army. In another area, the Soviet army advanced twenty miles in thirty-six hours. The German side is now using intensive air raids to try to slow down the Soviet counter-attack, but the Soviet army is still continuing to advance.

Reuters, Moscow, 6th - According to the Leningrad war report received by the Soviet official news agency, the seven-day battle has resulted in the defeat of the German 123rd Division and the 89th Regiment, which suffered heavy losses. The German side first concentrated artillery, tanks, and trucks full of soldiers, and then advanced in formation, but was blocked by the fierce artillery fire of the Soviet side. Although the German planes wanted to bomb the Soviet artillery positions, they were ultimately ineffective, and the German army's attempt to break through the Soviet fire line ultimately failed. The German army attacked repeatedly, and this continued for three days, until the fourth day, when their energy was exhausted. A captured German soldier stated that the German army had to retreat because the losses were too heavy. If they did not retreat, the German side would only have planes and artillery left without infantry. At the same time, "Pravda" published an article by a Soviet navy member, stating that the German army had repeatedly tried to break into the front line of the Soviet army defending the road to Crimea, but had been repulsed. The German army used various methods to try to break through the Soviet line. At one point, they used herds of cattle as a vanguard in an attempt to cover their advance, but the Soviet army was not deceived. They waited until the cattle were two hundred yards away before opening fire and fiercely attacking them. The cattle then turned back and trampled on the German soldiers. The weather there has already turned cold, and a captured German soldier had frozen fingers.

TASS, Moscow, 6th - The troops under the command of Kalitornov fought tenaciously, and after several days of fighting, inflicted heavy blows on the 8th Romanian Cavalry Brigade and the 399th German Infantry Regiment.

Our troops have captured three tanks, twenty artillery pieces, more than thirty machine guns, countless small artillery pieces, automatic rifles, motorcycles, automobiles, and 200,000 rounds of ammunition, as well as a large number of other military equipment. The counting of the spoils is still continuing.

The production of tanks will increase, the strength of the Red Army will increase, and the enemy will be crushed!"

### Germany Claims Soviet Army in the Sea of Azov Region Is Retreating East Under German Pressure

Reuters, Berlin, 6th - The German news agency transmitted a communique from the Romanian capital stating that the Soviet army is currently retreating east in the Sea of Azov region east of the Dnieper River. Although the Soviet side has a considerable number of soldiers and artillery, their offensive has been repulsed. Romanian mountain troops, in cooperation with German troops, repulsed an enemy attack in a bloody battle in Ukraine. Furthermore, a German news agency report last night, without disclosing the operational area, only stated that during the large-scale offensive on the eastern front, the German Air Force's actions focused on attacking the Soviet rear's military supplies and railways. A total of twenty trains were completely or partially destroyed by bombing, including one train carrying munitions that exploded after being hit. Twenty enemy planes were shot down in aerial combat, and another six enemy planes were also shot down. Many railway lines were blocked by bombs.

### German Air Force Heavily Bombs Soviet Railways to Prevent Soviet Troops from Going to the Front Line for Reinforcements

Havas, Somewhere on the Soviet border, 5th - Military observers here recently stated that the German Air Force is now beginning to heavily bomb the Soviet railway network, so that military supplies often cannot be transported to the front by rail. Each bombing involves more than a hundred German bombers, protected by fighter planes. The scale and destructive power are unprecedented. It is speculated that their purpose is to prevent the Red Army at the front from receiving reinforcements and to prevent General Timoshenko's troops from launching a counter-attack in the central region, thereby forcing the remaining troops to retreat eastward. However, whether this plan will succeed is difficult to say at this moment. As for the front-line battles, fierce fighting is taking place everywhere, with the fighting in the Leningrad region and within the Ukraine being the most intense. There is no news about the Red Army's counter-attack in the central region, but it is learned that the German army has sent reinforcements to prepare to deal with the Red Army's offensive with all its strength.

### British Pilots Help in Soviet Battles; New British Planes Parked at Soviet Airfields

TASS, Moscow, 6th - A reporter from "Izvestia" interviewed British pilots on the Soviet-German front and wrote, "Around the airfield are parked powerful new planes with British markings. The houses in the headquarters are bright and spacious. The commander of the British Air Force told the reporter, 'My pilots came to the Soviet Union and are honored to fight shoulder to shoulder with the courageous Soviet pilots. We are extremely amazed by the excellent airfield facilities, which are first-class buildings, both able to defend against air raids and equipped with super-class equipment. The British pilots, with the help of Soviet pilots in building the initial project, have already shot down twelve German planes, with only one loss on our side.'" The commander concluded, "Not long ago, our pilots needed a certain important instrument, and I asked your pilots to help us complete it in two or three days. Unexpectedly, all of them were prepared the next morning, and the work was extremely beautiful." The commander invited us to visit the dormitories of the British Air Force, with two rooms for the British pilots, one in the hangar and the other near the airfield, with dining rooms, radio stations, lounges, movie theaters, and bathrooms. We visited the team commanded by Major Luke, whose team came from various ports in England. Recently, British warplanes, together with Soviet bombers, went to the enemy's rear. The British Air Force commander told us that German planes were shot down by Luke's pilots. Pilot Chardern shot down three German planes. He said, "I want to strike the German fascists, that is why I came to the Soviet Union. I want to compete with your pilots, the best of your pilots have shot down ten to fifteen German planes each."

Reuters, London, 6th - Naval Minister Alexander said in a speech yesterday that assisting the Soviet Union is an urgent matter. We will see that everything that can be done will be done to assist the Soviet Union. Some say that we have not assisted the Soviet Union, but this does not understand the truth. We will continue to assist the Soviet Union and unite with the Soviet Union to achieve the ultimate victory.

TASS, Moscow, 6th - Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Director of the Intelligence Bureau, Lozovsky, said while hosting foreign reporters, "The Three-Power Conference has thrown the German side into disarray. Before the conference was convened, German radio claimed that this conference could not be held, but after the conference was convened, German radio claimed that the conference would not have any results, and said that the establishment of the Six Committees showed that the British and American representatives deliberately prolonged the conference. Although the conference had successfully completed its work in three days, German radio, unable to justify itself, claimed that the conference was hastily concluded, proving that no important issues were discussed. The tone of German propagandists changes several times a day, contradicting themselves, which is extremely ridiculous."

TASS, Istanbul, 6th - Turkish newspapers commented on the results of the Soviet-British-American conference. "The Sun Telegraph" especially emphasized Molotov's speech at the end of the conference, which stated the importance of firmly believing that British and American aid would be effective and that the military strength of the Red Army would not only be sufficient to resist the enemy but also to defeat the enemy. The newspaper said, "This confidence should not be regarded as baseless." The newspaper pointed out the abundance of Soviet resources, the unity of the Soviet people, and the absence of the dispersion and decadence imagined by the Germans. It also said, "The Russian army fights well, and the British supply of military supplies is beneficial to the Soviet war effort."

American Labor Federation Calls for Aid to the Soviet Union

Associated Press, Seattle, 6th - The Executive Committee of the American Federation of Labor argued in its annual report yesterday that the United States should sincerely assist the Soviet Union and should recognize the United States and the Soviet Union as friends. The annual report strongly stated that the Soviet Union's alliance with the armies of the democratic countries in this war was not out of its own will, and that its current show of friendship to Britain and the United States was out of necessity, so Britain and the United States should sincerely provide assistance to strengthen its confidence.

### Rumor of Frequent Conflicts Between German and Romanian Soldiers; Germans Plunder Romanian Livestock, Causing Great Famine to the Romanian Army

TASS, Moscow, 6th - In the camps of the fascist allies, disputes are constant. Hitler's followers openly treat the Romanians with contempt, insulting and plundering them. This can be confirmed by the "special order" issued by the German military department on the 11th. The "order" stated, "Recently, Romanian military authorities have complained that German troops have robbed Romanian troops of livestock. On one occasion, a German officer robbed livestock from a Romanian military camp. Similar incidents have occurred repeatedly, leading to conflicts between German and Romanian troops." German troops plunder Romanian troops' livestock and bread, resulting in great famine for the Romanian troops. The order continued, "German reserve officers and soldiers insult Romanian troops. The rude attitude of German reserve officers has been noticed by the military department." The one who published this order did not do so out of concern for Romania's national prestige. The prestige of the Romanian people has nothing to do with the Germans. The point they fear most is "that the Romanians will not tolerate the brutality of the Germans and will seize the opportunity to retaliate." This is the true relationship between the German fascists and their Romanian allies.

### German and Italian Leaders to Hold Discussions in Athens

International News Service, New York, 6th - The Columbia Broadcasting Company here received a report from Rome Radio stating that the German and Italian leaders are currently holding discussions in occupied Athens. Although their intentions have not been disclosed, it is widely expected to be a prelude to some new situation.

### German Envoy to Iran Returns to Sofia

Havas, Sofia, 5th - The German envoy to Iran, Eidel, together with personnel from the German and Bulgarian embassies in Iran, and several German expatriates, retreated by train to here today. Representatives from the local National Socialist Party branch and the German Embassy welcomed them at the station. After getting off the train, Eidel said that if our group had delayed leaving Iran by ten minutes, we would have been detained by the British and Soviet military authorities and imprisoned in Siberia and India, respectively, along with the 400 German expatriates who were being held as hostages. Bulgarian Chargé d'Affaires Danilov said that the British and Soviet military authorities did not allow Bulgarian expatriates in Iran to leave.

### The Truth About Soviet Paratroopers Landing in Bulgaria Comes to Light; It Was a Trick by the Bulgarian Authorities to Force Soviet Prisoners of War to Fill the Role

TASS, New York, 6th - According to a correspondent for the American National Broadcasting Company stationed in Turkey, the truth about the previous report of "Russian paratroopers landing in Bulgaria" has come to light. It is claimed that the Russian paratroopers were actually Russian prisoners of war who, under German-Bulgarian intimidation, were sent onto planes and forced to jump and land in Bulgarian territory. The purpose of this trick was to arouse anti-Soviet sentiment among the Bulgarian people and could be used as a pretext for declaring war on the Soviet Union. It is learned that the German side is still continuing to pressure Bulgaria to declare war on the Soviet Union.

### Soviet Intelligence Chief Refutes Hitler's Speech

Moscow TASS dispatch, 5th - The Director of the Soviet Information Bureau, Shcherbakov, in an article titled "Hitler Deceives the German People," commenting on Hitler's radio address on the 3rd of this month, stated: "Hitler used the excuse of launching the 'Winter Relief Campaign' to deliver his speech. However, the truth is that Germany had already been engaged in the 'Winter Relief' movement a month earlier. Regarding this matter, Hitler had already issued a 'Proclamation to the People' several weeks ago. From this perspective, Hitler's speech has absolutely no connection with the 'Winter Relief' movement. What, then, is the real motivation behind Hitler's having to deliver the speech? It is because the German fascist army suffered a crushing defeat on the Eastern Front, causing severe fear and dissatisfaction with Hitler's policies. The German people no longer trust the lies about 'the German army achieving unparalleled victories,' and have gradually lost confidence in the outcome of the war. 'Fear of events happening in the rear' is the real reason for Hitler's broadcast address on October 3rd. As we all know, Hitler has been recognized by the world as an aggressor. This person violated the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact and, without declaring war or making demands, suddenly launched an attack on the Soviet Union. Therefore, the facts prove that he is indeed an imperialist and a person who covets the territory of other countries.

It has been more than once that Hitler has attempted to conceal his piracy policies through various means. In his speech, Hitler claimed, "He did not attack the Soviet Union, but he anticipated that the Soviet Union would attack Germany. Therefore, he had no choice but to wage a war of self-defense to protect Europe." Regarding this point, we recall that when Hitler seized Holland, Belgium, Norway, Poland, and Greece, he also claimed that these countries were a threat to Europe and were bases for attacking Germany. These countries were allies of England, so the German side could still use this as an excuse. However, the Soviet Union neither formed an alliance with England nor signed a Non-Aggression Pact with Germany, yet Hitler still used this as an excuse, which is extremely absurd. In any case, this time it was Germany attacking the Soviet Union, and definitely not the Soviet Union attacking Germany. This fact is extremely obvious. The professional liar and magician Hitler can never cover up the eyes and ears of all the people in the world with one hand.

Hitler falsely claimed that Molotov, while in Berlin, requested to occupy the straits, conquer Finland, and invade Bulgaria, but was opposed by the German side. The Soviet side has repeatedly denied this lie, and there is no need to argue it further. In fact, when Molotov left Berlin, the Soviet-German joint communiqué stated, "The two sides exchanged views on various issues related to the interests of the Soviet Union and Germany in an atmosphere of mutual trust and reached a common understanding." Did Hitler not agree to the release of this joint communiqué? Does Hitler think that the world is forgetful and no longer remembers these facts? All of this proves that Hitler is a professional liar. In reality, Hitler is not only attempting to deceive world opinion about his treacherous policies, but he also repeatedly makes absurd claims about the German army's losses on the Eastern Front. In his speech on the 3rd of this month, Hitler admitted to misjudging the strength of the Soviet Union, but still released an absurd report on the losses of the Red Army, claiming that "the Red Army lost 2.5 million soldiers, 12,000 artillery pieces, 18,000 tanks, and 14,000 aircraft." This figure is clearly inaccurate.

In fact, in the past three months, the Red Army has suffered 230,000 deaths, 720,000 wounded, and 178,000 missing, totaling 1,128,000 casualties. In addition, it lost 7,000 tanks, 8,900 artillery pieces, and 5,316 aircraft.

Hitler did not mention a word about his own losses. This is because he fears telling the truth to the German people. Because once such huge losses are announced, his previous propaganda about "victory" will amount to nothing.

Since Hitler is unwilling to tell the truth about the losses, the Soviet Information Bureau has no choice but to reveal them on his behalf. In the past two months, the number of German troops killed, wounded, and captured on the Eastern Front has exceeded 3 million. This loss is equivalent to Germany's total losses in two years during World War I. In terms of material resources, the German side has also suffered great losses. In three months, the German side lost 11,000 tanks, 13,000 artillery pieces, and 9,000 aircraft. This is a fact that the German side cannot deny."

### Yomiuri Shimbun Commentary: Hitler Is Not Optimistic

Tokyo, Reuters dispatch, 6th - The Yomiuri Shimbun criticized Hitler's recent speech, saying that Hitler clearly does not harbor optimism about the progress of the war situation and admits that although the German army has won great victories, the Soviet Union is gradually becoming an arsenal.

### Random Notes on the European War (84) - The Headquarters of the Democratic Front

The increased demand for various goods and services, the disruption of urban life, and the high cost of living are all natural consequences. According to the statistics of the Department of Labor, the cost-of-living index was 100 last September. By March 15 of this year, it had increased to 0.09 percent for the low-wage class and had also increased for the middle-wage class. For example, having lunch in the city is the most uneconomical. Meal expenses have increased by as much as 25 percent in the past six months, and indigestion has also become a common ailment.

As for Washington's industry and commerce, they are more than happy to welcome this kind of prosperity. A year ago, the federal government's in-city civil servant salary expenditure was $22,582,980 per month, and since then it has increased by $5 million each month. As a result, those beautifully dressed female employees come out after work every afternoon, and the downtown area of Washington is as lively as Fifth Avenue in New York on Christmas Eve. All stores have to hire more clerks. As of January of this year, the business of the capital's department stores had increased by 21 percent compared to the same period last year. Even before the outbreak of the European War, Washington under the New Deal was already undergoing large-scale construction. For example, in 1938, 4,275 new homes were built in the city. By the time the national defense workers flocked in, that is, in the second half of last year, the number of homes had increased to 6,151, and this increase continues to this day. The government has also begun to rebuild six residential areas for black people, so as to place 4,275 new families around the city, and is planning to build a new dormitory to accommodate 1,000 female employees.

The capital's social life and nightlife have also been somewhat affected. Washington's upper class is influenced by the Presidential Palace and the embassies of various countries. However, the social life in these areas has now been shifted by the war. Banquets have become tasteless, and as the war expands, issuing invitations to diplomatic corps personnel becomes more difficult.

However, although banquets at the Presidential Palace and the embassies of various countries have decreased slightly, things are thriving elsewhere. New officials take office every day, and there is a series of banquets. Military officers leaving for duty is also a legitimate reason for a banquet. Normally, when summer arrives and the heat wave begins, important figures in the social circle go to the countryside to escape the heat, but this year they will not make this extravagant wish.

With the increase in the number of out-of-towners, social life has also become more lively. Anyone who wears a clean shirt seems to be a figure in the social world. As a result, the rooftop restaurants and dance halls of various hotels are often in chaos. The most noisy and unbearable of modern social gatherings is the "cocktail" party, which is now unprecedentedly popular.

Although the scale of Washington's nightclubs cannot be compared with those in New York, every one of them is packed. At the same time, every movie theater is full of people every night, with no empty seats. That being said, social life is still centered around the Georgetown and Alexandria areas.

When Sir Bryce talked about the United States not having a capital, he meant that it did not have a great capital like those in Europe, which collected the essence of the whole country and made itself the center of the country's politics, culture, and commerce. This criticism is indeed an undeniable truth, both at that time and today. For the past ten years, Washington's great political influence on the country has been unprecedented. At the same time, with the government managing industry and commerce, it has the potential to become the center of the country's finance and commerce, but it is still far behind in terms of culture.

Although Washington has many prestigious and talented poets, writers, and university professors, such as Sandburg and MacLeish, who are admirable, and the New Deal has also made many contributions to an ideal cultural society, it cannot be said that Washington has produced a large number of thinkers. Its many great art galleries and libraries do contain many great works of world art and literature, but they are still disappointing because these libraries and museums are mostly for people from other societies to come here and use.

Putting everything aside, Washington is still a contradictory city; the north side is bustling and hurried, while the south side is leisurely and carefree; white people and black people, rich people and poor people, live as neighbors; dreamers, patriots, politicians, cynics, liars, and swindlers live together. In addition, there are the decent, the evil, and the outdated. This strange and bizarre scene is actually a mixture of city and country.

When the Americans first built their capital, they took the model of various European countries. Various buildings, such as the Capitol Building, are not much different from the Palace of Peace in Paris; the corners of the Supreme Court Building are just like the temples of Rome; and the Lincoln Memorial has Roman-style columns. Except for the White House, which has always been the most beautiful building in the capital, the rest are all foreign styles.

However, precisely because of this reason, precisely because of the contradiction between the old and the new worlds, Washington seems to be worthy of its current position. After the current government issued a declaration announcing to the world, the United States of America has become the nurse of Western civilization. Because of the importance of the mission it bears, this new and beautiful city is indeed a very suitable place. (The End)

Academic Lectures

### Reading Should Include Taking Notes (Part 1)

— Weide

Note-taking is the most important and reliable basic skill for reading. Note-taking is also a wonderful method for absorbing knowledge and ideas. The knowledge and ideas that are absorbed, whether from reading or listening to lectures, are only vague and fragmented, and cannot be considered our own. We must make an effort to record them in our own words. Only then can that knowledge and those ideas be considered our own.

1.  The Effectiveness of Reading Notes

The importance of note-taking is well known. In the past, Zhao Yi's "Notes on the Twenty-Two Histories," Wang Niansun's "Reading Magazine," Yu Quyuan's "Commentaries on the Classics" and "Commentaries on the Philosophers," and Sun Yirang's "Zha Yi"... were all just expansions of the note-taking process. Therefore, note-taking is always necessary, no matter what subject one is studying. Zeng Guofan once lamented that he wrote slowly and did not take many notes, which he considered a great regret. Even in modern times, Cai Yuanpei said in his "Talks on Reading Experiences," "My ineffectiveness lies in not being diligent in writing." Whether for examining the diligence of reading, for absorbing thoughts and knowledge, or for developing our ability to think, note-taking is absolutely indispensable. Note-taking occupies a very important position in the art of reading, and reading notes occupy an important position in note-taking. Here, I will divide the effectiveness of reading notes into four points for explanation:

(1) Avoiding Forgetting: After reading a book, one does not necessarily remember everything. There must be an opportunity to review so as not to forget. A book can have dozens of pages or hundreds of pages. If one does not take notes, when it comes time to apply the knowledge, although one knows which book it is, one does not know which chapter or section. When reading, if one jots down the knowledge and ideas one has gained, and then has the opportunity to review, one must earnestly grasp that knowledge and those ideas.

(2) Facilitating Review: After reading a book, one may suddenly remember an important point in a certain chapter or section, but it is not very clear. One must take out the original book to review it. If we had taken notes at the time, we would only need to flip through the notebook and would not need to find the original book again. People's affairs are vast, and one does not know how much work one should do each day. To reread and review books that have already been read is not only too uneconomical in terms of time, but also feels very cumbersome in practice. Mechanical memorization is even more impossible. We can rely on reading notes to make it easier for us to review after reading.

(3) Assisting Memory: Reading notes can directly assist memory. Because one has already gained an impression when reading, and then writes notes in one's own words, the concept preserved in the mind has one more impression. Therefore, some people say that note-taking is the only tool to help memory.

(4) Correcting Thinking: When we read, we inevitably have points that are unclear or, although clear, not fully understood. If we jot them down, and then go through the effort of organizing them, the knowledge and ideas we gain will be systematic and correct.

2. The Methods of Reading Notes

There are roughly six methods of reading notes: (1) Copying: Copying notes is very useful. For example, we often have the regret of forgetting the articles we have discussed. If we copy them once, we can make our impression deeper. This is believable. Copying once is equivalent to discussing ten or twenty times. Liang Rengong said,

"When we read a famous book, we see him quoting and stretching his tongue and saying, 'This person doesn't know how much memory he has, he remembers so many things.' This is his special talent, we can't imitate it. In fact, that's not the case at all. People with good memories don't necessarily have wisdom, and people with wisdom comparatively have not very good memories. What you see is the result he has published, you don't know that this result originally came from accumulating inches and inches, and knowing and doing it diligently. Generally, a college student always has countless small booklets or single pieces of paper. When he reads a book and sees a piece of information that he finds useful, he immediately copies it down (the short ones copy the full text, the long ones summarize, and record the book title, volume number, and page number). Gradually, he accumulates a wealth of information, and then uses his eyes to organize and analyze it, and it becomes a famous work. This work is extremely stupid and extremely bitter, but people who truly do scholarship cannot leave this path. People who study animals and plants are too lazy to collect specimens, saying that he will have new inventions, I'm afraid there is no such cheap thing in the world."

### U.S. Millions of Youths Receive Military Training Already Approaching the Brink of War Far East Policy Centered on Aiding China U.S. Nationals Determined to Maintain Sino-U.S. Trade U.S. Missionaries Return to Shanghai After Returning Home to Discuss U.S. Wartime Preparations

According to a U.S. missionary who returned to Shanghai yesterday, "One million young people are currently undergoing rigorous military training. Although the United States has not formally been drawn into the vortex of war, it has actually embarked on the path to war. The United States has paid an extremely high price and will deal with those who destroy world justice, happiness, and order with the strongest posture."

U.S. Youth Sympathetic to China

The American missionary left China with his family last July to return to the United States for vacation. He recently returned alone, intending to travel to Free China to engage in church youth work. Before returning to China, because the U.S. State Department restricted people from going to the Far East, it was not easy to obtain a passport. Therefore, he had to go to Manila first and then wait for a ship to come here. He has been in China for many years and knows the Chinese national character well. After returning to the United States last year, he was very popular with the American people, who asked him to talk about his experiences in China. "Usually, those who are invited to speak are mostly doctors and masters, who have long enjoyed public expectations and are welcomed. However, someone who has just returned to the U.S. from China, even without a higher degree, his experiences in China are more welcomed than the knowledge of scholars. This is because the American people are very sympathetic to China, and are particularly eager to know the actual situation of China during the war."

Advocates for War and Accepts Military Training

He continued, "When I was in the United States, I often told people about the activities of Chinese youth, which gained widespread respect. Because the United States will also follow in China's footsteps, taking up arms and rising up to engage in a war to defend the country, China, which has already experienced war for four years, can naturally be a model for the United States. Currently, American youth are very active, do not value empty talk, and pay attention to practicality. No matter what group they join, what they ask for is nothing other than 'action.' Their enthusiasm for serving society is admirable. The acceptance of military training by one million young people can show the determination of American youth to be loyal and brave for the country. In the area of church youth, although there are different opinions on the issue of participating in the war, some advocate for war and some are against war, perhaps due to religious beliefs, generally speaking, American youth mostly advocate for war, which is the same as the initial mobilization and construction of Chinese youth."

Washington's Attitude Extremely Firm

As for the current intention of the United States to participate in the war, it is different from the previous European War. According to the missionary, "In the previous European War, the American people were strong and the government was soft, with the people urging the government to participate in the war. This time, the government is strong and the people are soft, with the government leading the people to war. This is an inevitable fact. Because the American people have lived comfortably for the past twenty years, their reaction may not be immediately strong in this crisis. Therefore, the leadership of the government authorities is naturally necessary. Regardless of the difference in the attitudes of the government and the people during the previous war and this war, the result is still participation in the war. It is no exaggeration to say that the United States is standing at the door of the world war. I firmly believe that the American people will unanimously support the government's established national policy. Except for a few stubborn isolationists, there can be no disagreement about participating in the war."

Enlistment Notices Posted All Over the Streets

"In addition to the visible fact of training, the development of the military industry and the increase in production make the entire United States immersed in the atmosphere of gunpowder. The posting of enlistment notices on the streets has made every person feel that war is unavoidable. In addition, the roar of government leaders has aroused a broad and strong sense of national consciousness. The growth of this consciousness is of course the capital needed for future warfare. Under this circumstance, an inevitable phenomenon is generated, that is, the increase in the standard of living. On average, the current standard of living in the United States has increased by 10% to 15%, especially recently. The value of automobiles is 30% higher due to luxury taxes. The phenomenon of wealth and poverty in the United States has always been very obvious, especially during wartime or on the eve of war."

Far East Diplomacy Consistent Policy

When the reporter inquired about the United States' Far East policy, he did not give a direct answer, but he implied that the will of the American people greatly contributed to the determination of the United States' Far East policy. Basically, the United States' diplomacy revolves around aiding China and containing Japan, but there are some considerations in its application. "The American people have always believed that the authorities should not sacrifice China's interests in order to obtain temporary peace in the Pacific," he said. "The exploratory talks between the U.S. and Japan once scattered seeds of unease in the minds of the American masses, but in fact, there is absolutely no compromise between the U.S. and Japan." Judging from the recent unfolding of the U.S.'s new attitude of aiding China, and the successive visits of financial experts and military missions to China, it can be seen that his words are not false, and it is even more evident that the United States is determined to fight in the Far East in times of emergency.

American Merchants Determined to Stay in Shanghai

The Continental Daily reported that Bill, the son of J.B. Powell, the editor and publisher of the China Weekly Review in this city, who previously worked for the Continental Daily, left Shanghai this summer to return to the United States to continue his studies at the University of Missouri. Before entering school, he visited his sister in Goose Creek City, Texas, and wrote an article in the city's Daily Sun, stating that although the business of American nationals in Shanghai has been greatly restricted since the beginning of the China incident, they are still determined to remain in Shanghai to the greatest extent possible. Although there have been repeated evacuations of American nationals in the Far East last year, there are still more than a thousand American citizens living in Shanghai and nearby areas. Most of them will not leave China unless they are forced to leave, because they all have their businesses or represent various American companies and are unwilling to give up their work or change their lives. Although the lives of foreigners have not been very pleasant in the past four years, it does not seem that they will leave China and return home.

Loves Shanghai and Concentrates on His Career

I (Bill said) believe that one reason why American nationals love Shanghai is the city's international nature. For example, the American-owned English-language Continental Daily carries news from various news agencies, including Associated Press, Reuters, Havas, Haitong, TASS, and Allied. In addition to being regarded as one of the largest metropolises in the East, Shanghai is also the gateway to China's vast interior. American nationals in Shanghai have met those who travel to the Far East. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, American businesses in China have been severely hampered. However, the majority of American nationals in Shanghai are determined to stay in Shanghai as long as possible. Most of them have been separated from their families because the United States withdrew women and children residing in the East, but they feel that as long as they can maintain any kind of business with the Chinese people, it will be the foundation for maintaining future trade relations between China and the United States.

### Building Fences at the Ends of Wuzhen Road Bridge Tight Security Checks on New Zhapu Road Bridge

After the demolition of the bridge on Wuzhen Road that connects to Zhabei in the middle section of New Zhapu Road, fences have been built at both ends of the bridge to prevent accidents. The New Zhapu Road Bridge is still open as usual, and there is a constant stream of pedestrians. Starting yesterday, Japanese soldiers at the north end of the bridge suddenly tightened security checks on pedestrians entering and exiting. Those carrying paper packages were required to open them for inspection. This tense atmosphere did not dissipate until late at night.

### Mold and Rotting Cotton Yarn and Machinery Port Traders Demand Returns Stored for Long Periods, Yarn Quality Changes Many Cannot Be Used for Weaving After Delivery

Large quantities of coarse and fine cotton yarn in this city are hoarded by speculative merchants who are blinded by profit, and much of it has been stored in warehouses for a long time. As a result, the quality of the yarn has changed over time, and it often becomes moldy and unusable. Yesterday, it was learned from the yarn industry that the cotton yarn warehouse receipts collected in this city by yarn merchants from Nanyang and Hong Kong have now been shipped out. After they are transported to their destinations, most of them cannot be used for weaving, resulting in huge losses. They have sent telegrams to export firms in this city to inquire and demand returns. However, these cotton yarn warehouse receipts are stored in warehouses by hoarders and sold through many intermediaries, so export firms are unable to take responsibility. It is now heard that merchants from Nanyang and Hong Kong have sought assistance from local chambers of commerce and are preparing to actively negotiate with various manufacturers in this city. It is also learned that dyeing and weaving manufacturers and cotton yarn end-users in this city who have purchased cotton yarn warehouse receipts have also discovered similar damage and are also preparing to negotiate. Therefore, it is difficult to predict what the future holds.

### 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic Preparations for Celebrations Throughout the City Remembrance of the Meritorious Deeds of the Martyrs All Levels of Society are Inspired

October 10th of this month is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. Although the people of Shanghai cannot hold extravagant celebrations due to the special environment, they remember the meritorious deeds of the martyrs who overthrew the imperial system and established the Republic. Their situation at that time was similar to the current situation. At that time, the Republic was established in the midst of thorns because the people of various places responded and supported it. Today, the whole country is united, taking steps under the leadership of the supreme leader to comprehensively resist and build. The date of final victory is in sight, so they feel excited about this great National Day commemoration and have decided to fly flags throughout the city and take a day off to celebrate. The police authorities of the two concessions, the consulates of Britain, the United States, and France, and foreign banks and businesses, and foreign warships stationed in the Huangpu River will all fly flags in addition to taking the usual holiday to celebrate the Chinese National Day.

Promoting Donations Enthusiastic Mood

In addition to taking holidays and flying flags, the people of the city are also promoting four major movements to express their love for the country and sympathy for the refugees, including thrift savings and refugee relief donations, initiated by various industry, commerce, and academic groups. Righteous people from all walks of life are excited and enthusiastically responding to this. Donation collection points and charitable organizations have received donations very enthusiastically in recent days. Many laborers have also made donations. This further proves that the patriotic enthusiasm of the people of the city has not diminished due to the special environment.

Issuance of National Day Commemorative Stamps The Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice stating that October 10th of this year is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. The Bureau has been ordered to issue stamps with the words "30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China" and "October 10, 30th Year" to mark the celebration. The types are as follows: (1) Sun Yat-sen Portrait Stamps, with six denominations: 2 cents, 8 cents, 10 cents, 16 cents, 30 cents, and 1 yuan; (2) Martyr Portrait Stamps, with four denominations: 1 cent, 4 cents, 21 cents, and 28 cents. The above commemorative stamps will be sold at all post offices from Double Tenth Day for a period of one month. From the date of termination of sale until the end of this year, they can still be used normally. Starting from January 1st of next year, they will be abolished and will no longer be used. However, if the public has any remaining stamps at that time, they will be allowed to exchange them for ordinary stamps of the same value at post offices within six months after the abolition. The stamp sales office on the third floor of the Bureau will be open as usual from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the morning of the 10th to sell these commemorative stamps.

Democratic Radio Station Celebration Program

The local Democratic Radio Station (frequency 1440) will broadcast a special program every day from 6:30 PM during this week, in addition to regular news and entertainment programs, to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China and hold a National Day celebration week. The currently scheduled programs are as follows: Monday: Joint Youth Vocal Concert; Tuesday: The Shanghai Drama and Art Society will broadcast Ding Xilin's latest work "Miaofeng Mountain"; Wednesday: Cen Jun's Sandalwood Mountain Music; Thursday: The Chinese Professional Theatre Troupe will broadcast Cao Yu's new work "Metamorphosis"; Friday, Double Tenth Day: Please the Shanghai Harmonica Association to broadcast a program; Saturday: Film stars Han Fei and others will broadcast a drama; Sunday: Professor Zhao Meibo's Western music program. All of the above programs will start at 6:30 PM, except for the Shanghai Drama and Art Society's "Miaofeng Mountain" on Tuesday, which will start at 6:15 PM. At the same time, the radio station will also broadcast programs on shortwave, with a wavelength of 11.92 megahertz, or 25.16 meters.

### Taikoo Two Rounds Temporarily Suspended

The British Taikoo Company's Yuezhou wheel, returned to Shanghai from Tianjin on the 27th of last month, docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession to unload cargo. In the evening, there was a sudden accident in the head cabin, causing part of the carpets in the cabin to be destroyed. The remaining cargo was flooded during the firefighting. The wheel was ordered to be driven to the Puxi Lan Yanzong dock the next day, and all the damaged goods were unloaded onto the stack. Now it has started to handle sea damage and other matters, as reported in the previous newspaper. It is now known that the wheel is also temporarily suspended due to the handling of sea damage matters. Another Beihai wheel came to Shanghai from Nanhua the day before yesterday (4th). When it sailed to the Copper Sand sea outside the Wusongkou, the ship's body ran aground on a shoal for some reason. The shipowner tried to pull it out and came to Shanghai. The ship's body was slightly damaged, so after entering the port, it was first docked on the Puzhong surface of Zhanghuabang, and then moved to the Lan Yanzong dock in Pudong by order of the company. Yesterday, it began to unload the incoming goods. Once the unloading is completed, it will be repaired in the dock.

### U.S. Navy Memorial Day Grandly Held

Twenty days from today is U.S. Navy Memorial Day. Admiral Heald, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, is currently staying in Manila, commanding everything. The Shanghai memorial ceremony will be co-hosted by Rear Admiral Grasford, commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet, to replace Commander Heald's absence from Shanghai. At that time, Admiral Heald will surely have a document here to show his determination to safeguard the interests of the Far East and to crush any attempt at any time. The U.S. fleet in China is now stationed in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Yantai, Shantou, North China Tianjin, and the farthest is Chongqing, with a strong lineup. The U.S. Navy Department will hold a grand memorial ceremony on this day.

### Subscriptions for Warehouse Rice Reach 40,000 Bags

The Shanghai Rice Dealers Association began to handle the registration of warehouse rice sales by the industry on the 3rd of this month. In recent days, those who have come to subscribe have been very enthusiastic. According to the association's report yesterday, as of yesterday, the number of people who have been certified is (1) 260 in the British Concession, (2) 200 in the American Concession, (3) 250 in the French Concession, and (4) about 150 in the Western District, accounting for more than two-thirds of the association's members. The amount of warehouse rice that has been certified is more than 40,000 bags, so large quantities of warehouse rice can be sold universally at a fair price in the two concessions. Although the association has closed the registration of warehouse rice at 5:00 PM yesterday, it will make an exception for those who failed to register within the specified period today. Those who have been certified and completed the registration procedures can pay at Fuyuan Qianzhuang, 70 Ningbo Road, and collect the delivery order within the date specified by the association (starting today in the Public Concession). The next day, they can present the order to the Rosford pier warehouse on the Bund for delivery.

### Establishment of Various Commercial Banks: Chongqing Fixed-Term Deposits; Interest Rates at a Premium Based on Shanghai-Chongqing Exchange Rates; Monthly Interest Around Two Percent

To guide the movement of Shanghai capital inland, various commercial banks have initiated Chongqing fixed-term deposits. Banks in the Sichuan (川) financial group have already begun offering these deposits. Funds deposited from Shanghai will be converted at the Shanghai-Chongqing exchange rate with a premium. The minimum deposit per account is 1,000 National Currency (國幣) units, with no temporary upper limit.

Fixed for Half a Month

The deposit and withdrawal dates are fixed as the middle and end of each month. Deposits made before these dates are also accepted, with interest calculated from the end of the month. Interest rates will be based on Chongqing rates and reviewed every half-month, offering a higher rate than Shanghai, approximately two percent monthly. Calculations will be based on Chongqing's standard National Currency. For example, a deposit from Shanghai of

Over 700 Yuan

Plus the exchange premium, would be converted to approximately 1,000 Yuan in Chongqing. Upon maturity, the principal and interest, in part or in full, will be paid in Chongqing's standard National Currency. If funds are to be withdrawn in cities outside Chongqing (within the Sichuan region), the bank will issue drafts. Withdrawals in Shanghai will be converted at the prevailing Chongqing-Shanghai exchange rate, aimed at limiting the flow of capital back to Shanghai. Initial trials have been quite effective.

### Origins and Development of Esoteric Buddhism: Melting Five Teaching Society Lecture

### Melting Five Teaching Society Lecture

The 22nd lecture of the Melting Five Teaching Society was introduced by Mr. Shen Jueling, featuring Mr. Wang Xianglu from Tianjin speaking on Buddhism. Mr. Wang began by stating that harmonizing the five religions is difficult, but melting them together is easier. He meticulously analyzed the meaning of melting versus harmonizing. He then praised Confucius, stating that while Confucius and Buddha differed in their approach to the world (one engaged, the other withdrawn), their teachings were most easily integrated. The key lies in understanding one's true nature and seeking it within oneself, referencing the Doctrine of the Mean, which says that "what Heaven imparts to man is called nature," and "before joy, anger, sorrow, or pleasure are aroused, it is called the Mean." He added that Zigon said that the Master's literary talent could be heard, but the Master's teachings on nature and the Way of Heaven could not. He pointed out that nature and the Way of Heaven are actually within his writings. His words were like peeling a cocoon or a banana, captivating the audience.

Harmony Comes From Non-Contention

In conclusion, he stated that the Pure Land, Chan, and Esoteric schools all ultimately return to the Samadhi of Non-Contention, and harmony comes from non-contention. Regardless of the path, one must commit to a single school and diligently practice, avoiding changing paths constantly. In time, one will naturally enter the Way. The audience was full, and everyone was captivated, with thunderous applause. After Mr. Wang stepped down, Mr. Yang Zhongyi continued with a lecture on "A Study of the Origins and Development of Esoteric Buddhism," saying he had been studying Buddhism for over thirty years, carefully extracting the essence of the Tripitaka and comparing it with native Chinese teachings, finding many confirmations. He had previously presented a complete table of the division and integration of the Three Extremes, aiming to integrate all the world's major religions.

Buddhism Transcends All Religions

He then realized that while Buddhism evolved from Brahmanism, it surpasses all other religions in the world. It then evolved into Judaism, and further into Islam. The God of Heaven is actually the Great自在天 (Mahadeva) of Buddhism. Laozi and Zhuangzi’s Taoism is philosophy, not religion. Ever since Mao Meng's prophecies, and the renaming of the twelfth month, Qin's pursuit of immortality, Han Wu's Feng and Shan sacrifices, Ge Hong's "Baopuzi," and Boyang's "Cantongqi," Marquis Liu's fasting (during the early Han dynasty) and Daoling's performance of talismans (during the late Han dynasty), Kou Qianzhi's rise in the north (during the Northern Wei dynasty), and Tao Hongjing's further prominence in the south (during the Liang dynasty), alchemy and talismans have been attributed to Taoism, and the Mysterious Female and Valley Spirit have evolved into mystery.

The Origins of Esoteric Buddhist Thought

Their Five Forms and Nine Incantations then inspired later Esoteric Buddhism. Mr. Tsumaki Naora of Japan said, "The ghosts and spirits mentioned in Baopuzi, along with the Six Jia secret incantations, the Nine Syllable True Words, and the Ling talismans of the True Form Chart of the Five Peaks, were all imitated by later Esoteric Buddhism. This proves its close connection with the thought of Baopuzi," as discussed in the "Toyo Gakuho" (東洋學報, Journal of Oriental Studies), Volume 1. Thus, Nagarjuna and Vasubandhu revealed emptiness and existence in India; Kumarajiva and Bodhiruci transmitted the image of the Dharma in China. Nagarjuna was also formerly translated as Kumarajiva, and Bodhiruci translated Nagarjuna's "Sunyatasaptati" (中論, Madhyamaka-karika) as "Long Sheng." The Tang dynasty's new translation of Nagarjuna is Long Meng, as seen in the "Records of the Western Regions." The past Buddha Wonderful Cloud Appearance is also called the Tathagata Wonderful Cloud自在王 (Isvararaja). He appeared in the first stage of joy, as seen in the "Records of Responses to the Three Treasures," quoting the "Vajra Samadhi Sutra," the "Mahavyuhasamadhi Sutra," the "Chronicles of the Transmission of the Dharma," and the "Essentials of the Eight Schools."

Founders of the Exoteric and Esoteric Eight Schools

Born into a Brahmin family, he was well-versed in scriptures. He was the disciple of Asvaghosa's disciple. Seven hundred years after Buddha's Nirvana, he was the fourteenth patriarch in the lineage. He entered the dragon palace and brought back the Avatamsaka Sutra, opened the iron tower and transmitted the secret treasury, and is known as the founder of the Exoteric and Esoteric Eight Schools. The scriptures spoken by Sakyamuni's Nirmāṇakāya (应身佛, transformation body) Buddha are the Exoteric teachings. The secret Dharma directly taught by Vairochana's Dharmakāya (法身佛, dharma body) Buddha is Esoteric Buddhism. He truly transmitted the gods and teachings of the Brahmins. Outside the Tripitaka of Sutras, Vinaya, and Abhidhamma, there is the Ritual Treasury. Its Protective Mouth True Words (衛口真言, Dharani), Body Seals (身印契, Mudras), and Mind Contemplations (心觀念, Mandala) correspond to the Three Mysteries (身口意, Body, Speech, and Mind). The Mandala diagrams transmitted by Esoteric Buddhism have different Vajra and Womb World aspects. These were not separate in India, but began with Subhakarasimha and Vajrabodhi in China. Subhakarasimha received the transmission from Dharmagupta of Nalanda Temple and came north. Vajrabodhi received the transmission from Nagarjuna's disciple Nagabodhi in Sri Lanka and came south, meeting in Qin. They each taught their learnings to Amoghavajra.

Subhakarasimha and Dharmagupta

Some say Dharmagupta is Nagabodhi, others say Subhakarasimha transmitted to his fellow disciple Vajrabodhi, and others say Amoghavajra returned to India to receive both lineages from Nagabodhi, transmitting them to Hui Guo. Others say Subhakarasimha transmitted to Hui Guo. In the fourth year of the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Subhakarasimha came and transmitted the Womb World Mandala. In the eighth year, Vajrabodhi came and transmitted the Vajra Mandala. Amoghavajra came with him, only sixteen years old. He returned after twenty-nine years, and came again in the fifth year of the Tianbao era, translating over a hundred scriptures and treatises in one hundred and forty-three volumes. He received generous treatment from Emperor Daizong. Yi Xing first followed Subhakarasimha, then received initiation from Vajrabodhi. In Japan, Esoteric Buddhism has two branches: Amoghavajra and Hui Guo transmitted to Kukai, known as Kobo Daishi, which is the To-Mitsu. The Tendai sect of Mount Hiei is from the Subhakarasimha lineage. The Mandala is the result of the Womb World and the cause of the Vajra World, which is opposite of the To-Mitsu. Outside the two branches, Ennin transmitted the Susiddhikara ritual, making it the Three Divisions. After the Tang Dynasty, Esoteric Buddhism flourished in Japan, while China only preserved the Yoga Flaming Mouth ritual. In the early Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty, the transmission of Esoteric Buddhism was forbidden. Tibetan Lamaism, transmitted by Padmasambhava from India. In the late Qing Dynasty, Yang Wenhui's disciples Gui Nianzu, Shamen Xianyin, and Dayong Chishong successively studied in Japan. Wang Hongyuan of Guangdong and Chaozhou and Cheng Zhaitan of Sichuan went to Japan for initiation. Recently, Rong Zeng Kanbu, a disciple of the Panchen Lama, came to Shanghai, and many received Dharma from him. In the future, someone will certainly integrate the Esoteric Buddhism of East and Tibet.

### There are Still Large Tides Today

The tide in the Huangpu River has been quite high for the past few days. The measurements are all above twelve feet, and today's tide is expected to be the highest, approaching thirteen feet. The Bund's embankment will be topped by the tide, and water reaching the low-lying Rue du Consulat (雀馬路) is unavoidable. This high tide is expected to subside after the tenth. From then on, autumn floods can be anticipated.

### US Lake-Class Gunboat Sails up the Yangtze

The US Navy's shallow-water gunboat USS Luzon (呂宋號), stationed in Shanghai, left Shanghai for a cruise on the Yangtze River one day, returning three days later. Details were reported in a previous newspaper. Now, we know that the US gunboat USS Oahu (奧湖號) raised anchor at noon yesterday and departed from the Wusong port at 2 PM, heading up the Yangtze River.

### Coal at Fixed Prices for Two Industries to be Sold Starting Today

### Robbers Flee With Stolen Goods: Killed Japanese Soldier with Gunfire; Soldier Tries to Intercept Approaching Robbers: Shot in a Vital Spot, Also Injuring a Passerby

At the intersection of Haining Road and North Jiangxi Road in Hongkou, an incident occurred last night around 8:40 PM in which robbers shot and killed a Japanese soldier on guard duty. A stray bullet also injured a passerby. The details are reported as follows:

Fleeing With Stolen Goods

A robbery occurred at a certain address on East-West Huade Road in Hongkou around 8:40 PM last night. The victim secretly reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which quickly dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives. The robbers, realizing they had been discovered, scattered in all directions with the stolen goods. Two of them ran towards the intersection of Haining Road and North Jiangxi Road, with detectives in hot pursuit, blowing whistles.

Soldier Killed

A Japanese naval landing force private first class, named Ikeda Masaharu (池田正治, age 30), stationed at the wire mesh entrance there, noticed two men in short clothes running frantically. Realizing they were not good people, he rushed forward, intending to block their path. However, finding no way to escape, the robbers pulled out their guns and fired several shots at the Japanese soldier. Ikeda Masaharu was unable to dodge and was shot in vital areas, including his left face, chest, and ribs. He immediately fell to the ground and died. The robbers ultimately escaped.

Passerby Injured

At the same time, a passerby named Ji Xibing (季錫炳, age 25) was hit in the left chest by a stray bullet and collapsed. Street police summoned an ambulance, which transported him to the Shanghai Sanitarium Hospital on Target Road for treatment. Afterwards, the Japanese military authorities, upon receiving the report, immediately blocked all bridges connecting Suzhou Creek. They, together with police officers from both the Hongkou and Public Concession police stations, cordoned off the area and conducted a rigorous search for the robbers. The operation continued until midnight without success. The body of the Japanese soldier was taken away by the Japanese in a hearse. The bridges over Suzhou Creek that had been closed were reopened at approximately 10:35 PM.

### Candy Shop Pelted with Excrement

Yesterday evening at 9 PM, while the Lao Shen Cheng Chang (老申成昌) candy and pastry shop at No. 16 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession (across from the Great World entertainment center) was crowded with customers enthusiastically buying mooncakes, a ruffian suddenly appeared, holding a paper package. He threw it into the shop. The package turned out to be full of excrement. The package broke upon impact, splattering the foul liquid everywhere. The shop assistants and the merchandise were covered in excrement, and a terrible stench filled the air. Customers scrambled to escape. The ruffian turned and fled. The shop assistants chased after him and caught the perpetrator. He confessed his name was Liu A Yi (劉阿一), from Shaoxing, and claimed he was hired for ten yuan to do this. He was vague on further details. He was taken into custody at the police station pending investigation. It is rumored that this incident is related to a labor dispute with the guild. The police are investigating the instigator based on Liu's testimony and are working to arrest and prosecute him in conjunction with Liu.

### Fire at the Kang Nian Pharmaceutical Factory

At approximately 10:10 PM last night, a fire broke out at the Kang Nian Pharmaceutical Factory workshop at No. 53 Rue Amiral Bayle in the Public Concession due to careless handling of alcohol. Two workers were burned. Zhang Menghai (張孟海), age 17, from Suzhou, was burned on his left hand, foot, and head. Zhang Hao (張豪) suffered severe burns on both hands and feet, with the skin peeling off, a ghastly sight. An ambulance was summoned to the scene and transported the injured workers to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, there were many people at the factory who quickly extinguished the fire, preventing a major disaster.

### Thugs Demand Festival Fees: Mob Injures Vegetable Vendor

Li A Si (李阿四), residing at No. 11 Rongchang Lane, Avenue Edward VII, Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou, has been running a vegetable stall at the Old Zhabei Market. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month (Mid-Autumn Festival) around 4 PM, a thug named Lu A Hai (魯阿海), nicknamed "Little Devil Ah Hai," demanded Mid-Autumn Festival fees from Li, leading to a conflict. This angered Lu, who gathered over twenty thugs, including "Long Legs Ah Gen" and "Shi Lao Ba," carrying iron bars and other weapons. They stormed Li's home and beat him severely before scattering. Li reported the incident to the Tilanqiao Police Station and showed them his injuries. The police dispatched officers to arrest the perpetrators, but Lu A Hai had already fled. A strict search is underway.

### Foreign Reporter's Account of Touring Nanshi

The "Continental Times" reports that Nanshi today is a scene of poverty, but gambling is rampant, which is quite strange. In the past half year, six large gambling dens have opened in Nanshi, attracting thousands upon thousands of gamblers. Inside, one sees gamblers huddled together, intently watching the progress of the gambling, beads of sweat dripping from their foreheads, a pitiable sight. Outside the gambling dens, on the stone roads overgrown with weeds, are impoverished people, mostly peasants and coolies.

Gambling is Most Flourishing

Currently, the most flourishing business in Nanshi is gambling, followed by used clothing and shoe stores, which are also very prevalent. These used goods stores are located at the entrances of gambling dens. Gamblers often lose all their cash and then go to the used goods stores to sell their clothes, shoes, and hats. The reporter saw a well-dressed Chinese man emerge from a gambling den and enter a used goods store, quickly sell his shoes for six yuan, and then return barefoot to the gambling den for one last desperate gamble. Gamblers enter and leave the gambling dens day and night without ceasing.

Gamblers Huddled Together

The reporter also strolled inside and was immediately approached by two women who pulled at his sleeve, inviting him to the gambling table. Six women were playing "blackjack" next to the table and persistently invited the reporter to join. The reporter dislikes this sort of thing and only offered to bet five jiao. They covered their mouths and laughed, as the minimum bet was one yuan and usually five yuan. There were over thirty large gambling tables in the gambling den, surrounded by gamblers. The reporter saw a portly Chinese man pull out a stack of ten-yuan bills, and soon only half of them remained.

Young Women Hawking

Gamblers can drink and smoke for free. For those who bring children, fruit and milk are provided upstairs, and Western and Chinese meals are provided for free. There are even young women serving those who use drugs, to attract more gamblers. When a gambler has lost badly and is penniless, the gambling den provides five or six cars to take him home. The most popular gambling game is "Tai Sai" (大小, Big Small), and the bets are enormous. The reporter saw a "Tai Sai" table where tens of thousands of yuan changed hands in a quarter of an hour. Cantonese people love Fan-Tan, and there is a special section where only Japanese people are allowed to gamble.

Rubble and Ruins

About a year ago, Nanshi was very desolate, only inhabited by beggars and the extremely poor. Now, however, even damaged houses without doors, windows, or roofs have residents. Rubble and ruins are still everywhere. Houses destroyed by gunfire have rarely been rebuilt. The piles of rubble serve as public toilets, with an unbearable stench. When the Japanese opened Nanshi a year ago, Chinese people were attracted by the low rents and poured in. According to the reporter, Nanshi rents are only one-eighth of what they are in the concessions, and there are no "small rent" (小租) scams.

Inside the City God Temple

Transportation in Nanshi relies entirely on rickshaws. Occasionally, a car passes by, all driven by Japanese people or from gambling dens. Although there are quite a few shops in Nanshi, they are all small stores. There are probably no more than ten wealthy Chinese residents in Nanshi. Their homes are surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by armed men. In the past, the City God Temple was filled with incense smoke, and devout men and women prostrated in worship. The market was crowded with customers and extremely prosperous. Now, the temple market is gone. Only a few poor people buy and sell rice and noodles where rare treasures were once sold. Several beggars are in front of the Buddha statues, either lying on the ground or catching lice, silent and still.

Few Japanese

There are no Japanese soldiers on the streets of Nanshi, as they have been almost entirely withdrawn. The few remaining Japanese soldiers are stationed inside barracks heavily fortified with barbed wire and sandbags. In major cities like Beiping and Nanjing, Japanese shops line the streets, but the reporter only saw one or two Japanese shops while touring Nanshi for four hours. He encountered no more than ten Japanese people. Since the residents are mostly from the impoverished class, they are unlikely to be targeted by bandits.

Theft and Extortion

However, petty theft is rampant. It is said that at least five thousand people are currently arrested and awaiting trial for fraud and theft. According to Nanshi residents, they do not pay "small rent" (小租), but they are often subjected to extortion, resulting in significant losses. Every Chinese resident of Nanshi must pay one yuan and four jiao to obtain a residential registration certificate. Without this certificate, they will be arrested. The Japanese have confiscated the houses abandoned by Chinese people who fled Nanshi during the Battle of Shanghai and are now renting them out at low prices. A three-room house rents for thirty yuan per month.

Heroin is Rampant

There are many opium dens in Nanshi. Only registered opium smokers are allowed inside. Heroin use does not require registration. Heroin is ten times more harmful than opium, and heroin is rampant in Nanshi. Countless people are using it, and many are dying from its toxicity. Two cinemas have recently opened in Nanshi, but they are rarely full, as gambling addicts prefer to frequent the gambling dens, and 95% of the residents cannot even afford food and clothing, let alone regularly go to the cinema. Access to the area along the Huangpu River is prohibited. From what the reporter saw, the area along the river is quite deserted, with only a few small boats idly moored by the riverbank.

Fleas are Abundant

Most of the factories along the river are closed. There are not many beggars in Nanshi, perhaps because the residents are too poor to give alms. Although there are few beggars, there are many fleas. The reporter has traveled all over the world, and he has not seen as many fleas as in Nanshi, except in Turkey and Romania. During his tour of Nanshi, he took a rickshaw twice and visited a friend's home for a short chat, and was bitten by fleas.

### French Police Department: Criminal Report

Criminal cases in the French Concession in September were roughly the same as in the previous two months, including two assassination cases. The first occurred on September 1st in Lane 401, Avenue Foch. The perpetrator was an unknown person, and the victim was a shareholder of the Chang An gambling den. The second victim was a Russian merchant named Mamontoff, who was shot in the abdomen at 6 AM on September 14th while traveling by rickshaw in front of Lane 1252, Route Lafayette. He died the following day in the Hopital Sainte Marie due to his injuries. After the incident, the French police immediately began investigating. On the second day, the police arrested the gunman and a suspect who was alleged to have incited the murder. A third accomplice was apprehended on the third day. The gunman was a Chinese bodyguard who had been paid seventy yuan in advance. The accomplice who recruited the gunman had received three hundred yuan. Although the victim, Mamontoff, was severely wounded, he was able to tell the police the name of the instigator, identified as Bik, also known as Avans. The motive was personal revenge. All three suspects are currently under investigation.

There was only one kidnapping case involving weapons. The victim was the manager of the Great China Rubber Factory, who was kidnapped by seven bandits at 7 AM on the 7th of the month at his residence on Avenue Haig.

In September, there were nine robberies and armed robberies. After investigation, twenty-eight robbers were apprehended, and three handguns were recovered, one of which was a forgery. In addition, there were two incidents of police officers being robbed. The first occurred on the night of September 1st at the intersection of Route Belles and Rue Montauban when two robbers approached an Annamite policeman on duty and stole his handgun. When the policeman gave chase, one of the robbers fired a shot, killing a passerby who tried to stop them. The second incident occurred on Route Belles No. 25 Lane. A Sikh policeman was robbed by armed robbers. One of the three robbers was shot and killed by a Chinese policeman from the Public Concession. A Mauser pistol was found on his body.

In September, incidents of property damage and burglary decreased slightly compared to August. There were twenty-two cases of property damage and theft, compared to twenty-nine in August. There were twenty cases of burglary, compared to twenty-four in August. Sixteen of these cases have been solved, and fifteen burglars have been apprehended. During the same period, the police received 131 reports of ordinary theft, of which fifty-nine have been solved, and seventy-four suspects have been apprehended.

Among these reports, nine involved the theft of automobiles. All of these automobiles have been recovered, but some of them have had parts such as batteries stolen.

Also, the police conducted 132 searches of hotels and inns in the Concession in September.

### Japanese Warehouse Burned Down: Heavy Losses; One Foreign Firefighter Slightly Injured

The "Continental Times" reports that a major fire broke out on Haining Road yesterday (the 5th) at 4 PM, destroying two Japanese-owned warehouses and spreading to a neighboring lumberyard and cardboard box factory. A foreign firefighter from the Public Concession Fire Brigade, Stan辛耐維樞, sustained minor injuries while fighting the fire and was immediately taken to a hospital. His injuries are reportedly not serious. The losses from the fire have not yet been estimated. However, the owner of the burned building stated that all of his property was almost entirely destroyed. The Japanese warehouse contained a large quantity of paper, which is reportedly where the fire started. It quickly spread to the neighboring lumberyard. Five fire engines arrived at the scene and extinguished the fire after four hours.

According to the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun," at around 3:40 PM on the 5th, a fire broke out in the Yamada warehouse, No. 91 Jiugeng Lane, No. 97 Haimi Road (负责人岩永松之助, Manager Iwanaga Matsunosuke), which belongs to the Stacking Trade Association. The fire quickly spread, and the warehouse and six residential houses were burned down. The fire was extinguished at 5 PM. The cause of the fire is unknown, and the losses are estimated to be very large, totaling 500,000 yuan (兀).

### Five-Year-Old Child Scalded to Death

Weng Baofu's (翁寳富) only son, Xiao Mao (小毛), age five, residing at No. 1158 Xujiahui Road, was playing outside on the afternoon of the 1st of this month around 4 PM. He bumped into a copper pot of boiling water being carried by a nine-year-old girl. The scalding water burned his right face, abdomen, and legs. He was sent to the Hopital Sainte Marie. Due to the heat toxicity affecting his heart, treatment was ineffective, and he died on the afternoon of the 4th at 5 PM.

### Owner of Rui Feng Rayon Company, Yu Ruilin, Shot to Death: Shot while Riding in a Chartered Car out of the Lane: Struck in the Chest and Abdomen, Died Instantly

At 10:50 AM yesterday morning, an assassination took place at the entrance of Cuixiang Lane on Ningbo Road in the Public Concession. The victim was Yu Ruilin (俞瑞林), the owner of Rui Feng Rayon Company, who was shot twice and died instantly due to injuries to his chest and abdomen. The details of the case are reported as follows:

Established Silk Company

Yu Ruilin, age 28, from Shaoxing, previously established Rui Feng Rayon Company at No. 16 Yu Yu Lane on Nanjing Road. He moved to No. 9 Cuixiang Lane, No. 446 Ningbo Road, in May of this year due to business expansion. At the same time, Yu lived in the shop with his concubine, Ms. Jin (金氏, age 25, from Shaoxing), and their son (born twelve months ago). Due to the flourishing business, Yu also opened Jifan Silk Factory in Hongkou, serving as its manager.

Shot While in Car

At 10:50 AM yesterday morning, Yu, wearing a gray parisienne long gown and yellow leather shoes, was being pulled out of the lane in his own chartered car No. 11304 by a rickshaw puller named Chen Hairu (陳海如) from Tongzhou. He was heading to meet a client for business. As they were turning east at the lane entrance, two assassins suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, one wearing a cotton shirt and pants, and the other wearing a black gown. The assassin in the short shirt and pants fired a shot. The bullet struck the tire, causing it to explode with a loud bang.

Two Shots Prove Fatal

Yu, hearing the gunshot, quickly jumped out of the car, attempting to take cover. The assassin chased after him and fired two more shots, one hitting Yu in the abdomen and the other in the chest. He immediately collapsed in a pool of blood, gasping for breath. The rickshaw puller, Chen Hairu, was being watched by the other assassin and did not dare to shout for help. Seeing that their objective had been achieved, the two assassins mingled into the crowd and escaped without a trace. Nearby police officers arrived after hearing the news and quickly summoned a car to take the injured Yu to Renji Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, he soon died. The police are currently investigating the circumstances of the case. It is also known that Yu has a wife, Ms. Xu (徐氏), who has a son and currently lives in their hometown.

### Repeat Drug Offender Sentenced to Twelve Years in Prison

Xu Genkun (徐根坤), from Ningbo, was arrested on September 27th of this year at around 8 AM for using drugs at a certain address in Ruifeng Lane, Rue Macarthur. He was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court, presided over by Judge Shi Meiyu (石美瑜). The defendant, Xu Genkun, confessed to using drugs. However, after the court clerk checked the records, it was found that the defendant had been convicted three times by the First Special Court for using opium and heroin. Judge Shi then announced the conclusion of the trial. Yesterday, it was ruled that Xu Genkun, as a repeat offender for drug use, would be sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. The ten packets of heroin were confiscated.

### The Extent of Increase in Chinese and Western Stocks

— Bing Zhong

In the past, except for a few stocks whose market prices were occasionally heard, Chinese stocks were mostly unknown. Even large securities firms mainly dealt in government bonds as their main business, while stock trading was only a side business, which they could do or not do. If customers came to the door, they might or might not attend to them. However, everything is impermanent, and what is usually looked down upon may suddenly be elevated, and dead trees may bloom. Just as a dull scholar may have a chance to rise, the rise of Chinese stocks is similar to this.

Because rich people look down on money, they almost want to convert all their money as quickly as possible. Not to mention stocks, even bamboo heads, wood scraps, broken copper, scrap iron, and broken threads are favored by hoarders. Therefore, under this psychology, everything is valuable except for banknotes. In fact, banknotes are not worthless; if they were worthless, where would the money come from? In order to buy foreign stocks, sometimes people suffer great losses. When they buy in, the price immediately falls, and when they sell out, it soars. They are slapped on both sides of the face, and the money flows into the pockets of foreigners. Why should the money that Chinese people have worked so hard to earn be squandered by others? Wealth should not flow out, so it is better to buy and sell Chinese stocks.

The flourishing business of buying and selling Chinese stocks has only been in recent years. The first company to focus on buying and selling Chinese stocks as its business and appeal to society was China Stock Company. Later, more people echoed, the trading flourished, and there were more people doing Chinese stock business. Since the expansion of the European war into the German-Soviet war, and the US attitude has become increasingly clear, there is a possibility of a storm in the Pacific at any time. People generally have more considerations about the future of foreign stocks. Many stable friends and patriotic wealthy people thought that it would be better to buy and sell Chinese stocks. It is the same as making money, so why cultivate other people's fields instead of one's own? Therefore, Chinese stocks have recently become more popular than foreign stocks.

To what extent have Chinese and foreign stocks risen now? Usually, we only see them rise in the newspapers, but we don't know how much they have risen. Therefore, we will compare the transaction price of each stock with its face value, and then list its market price above or below the face value. We originally wanted to use the market prices of October 1, but we later chose the most recent day, which was Friday, October 3. If there was no market price on that day, we might refer to October 1 or 2. All the prices used are transaction prices. If there is no transaction price, we may use the buying price.

Foreign stocks are very conservative - or rather, inert. China has long abolished taels and adopted yuan, but their share capital is still calculated in taels (and some in pounds), but their market prices are now quoted in legal tender. Therefore, for the convenience of readers to compare, we will uniformly convert the legal tender used to express market prices into the same currency as the face value for comparison. There is no problem with taels at 0.715. Although 70 yuan per pound is lower than the current exchange rate, it is good that the conversion rate has different sizes, and the ratio is ultimately similar.

As for the trends of various stocks, they are already shown in the table and will not be described further. Readers will understand after a brief look.

— Feng Liutang

Hoarding (II)

Some say that Zigong, a disciple of Confucius, was good at commerce, so it is said, "If there is a beautiful jade here, should I keep it in a box and hide it, or should I seek a good merchant and sell it?" Is this not hoarding for profit? I say: No, let alone Zigong's analogy to ask Confucius why he had the Way but did not serve, even from the literal point of view, keeping a beautiful jade in a box and hiding it, and seeking a good price to sell it, is at most a kind of speculation. However, speculation also has its limits. If you have obtained a good price but still refuse to sell, then it is called speculation. If you wait for a merchant to sell, it is not wanting to sell jade on the street, which is different from the meaning of hoarding. Hoarding is gathering a large amount of goods, waiting for a merchant to obtain an extraordinary profit, while keeping jade in a box is nothing more than regarding it as a rare treasure, carefully treasured.

Then, can Mencius's "seeking a dragon ridge to ascend, to look left and right, and to plan for market profits" be called hoarding? I say: Yes, but the degree is still different. A dragon ridge (long ridge) is a high ridge in the field. Mencius used it as a metaphor for a merchant waiting to sell goods, like climbing high to look left and right, to see where the price is high, and then sell there to make a profit. It is not that the dragon ridge is hoarding. However, the dragon ridge is quite similar to today's exchange market, because buying and selling in the exchange market has the ability to influence market prices. People think it is high, it is high; it is low, it is low. The auctioneer sits high and looks down, looking left and right, very much like climbing a dragon ridge and looking left and right. However, this is not the dragon ridge that Mencius meant at that time. The English word for monopoly is Corner, which originally meant a corner. Refusing to sell in a corner is as good as ascending a ridge and looking around. How similar is the intention of Chinese and Western words?

If so, then Fan Li's "managing property and accumulating goods with the times" can be considered today's hoarding. I say: Although it is similar, in fact it is not as severe as today's hoarding, it is only the usual inventory in commerce. After King Goujian of Yue ascended the throne, Fan Li knew that he could not live in peace with him, so he thought of Ji Ran's plan, used five out of ten, and ascended the throne of Yue. Now that he had applied it to the country, he wanted to apply it to his family. So Li took a small boat, floated on the rivers and lakes, changed his name, and went to Tao in the state of Qi. He called himself Zhu Gong (also called Tao Zhugong, using the place name and pseudonym together. Zhu Gong had a great reputation and lived in Tao, so he was called Tao Zhugong.) Because Tao was located in the center of the world, the lords communicated with each other, and goods were traded there, so he managed property and accumulated goods with the times, and did not demand from others. The so-called "property" means production, so "managing property" and "making a living" are often mentioned together. However, the meaning of "property" is broad, and all property is called property. Because property can be produced, it is called property; property can establish a business, so it is also called industry. Goods are a large part of property, and property includes goods. Managing means managing (the Tang people avoided the name of Emperor Gaozong, so all "managing" was changed to "managing"), managing property means managing goods. Accumulating means storing, accumulating with the times means hoarding goods to profit with the times. However, in running a business, it is necessary to store goods in advance to meet general demand, so accumulating is not hoarding. However, if you accumulate goods but do not sell them at high prices, and the amount you accumulate far exceeds the amount you should have prepared for sales, then it can be called hoarding. As for profiting with the times, it is the proper meaning of commerce.

However, the so-called "expensive granary" in the late Western Han Dynasty is almost equivalent to the meaning of hoarding. A granary is a storehouse. An expensive granary means that the stored goods must wait until the price is high before they are sold. Is this not hoarding for profit? Hoarding is thinking that there are rare goods to hoard; refusing to sell what you have bought, you will not sell until you achieve your desired purpose. When goods become rare, their self-regard is high. Then, where did the word hoarding come from? I think it comes from accumulating grass and storing grain. Accumulating grass and storing grain was originally used to supply the army, not for doing business. Because horses cannot do without grass and the army cannot do without grain, it is called hoarding to gather a large amount of grain and grass for use. It is then applied to commerce, which is what we call hoarding goods for profit today.

Shanghai merchants call hoarding goods "collapsing goods." When asked what collapsing means, they say "collapsing in." Collapsing in is not enough to exhaust the meaning of hoarding. Hoarding must mean gathering a large amount of goods, which collapsing in cannot encompass, so its meaning must be elsewhere. However, I do not know that the meaning of "collapsing" has been around for a long time. In the early Ming Dynasty, the residences of soldiers and civilians in the capital (the capital at that time was Nanjing) were all provided by the government, and there was no space between the houses. Therefore, when merchants' goods arrived, they either stopped on boats or were stored outside the city. The middlemen got the price together, and the merchants suffered. The Taizu then ordered the construction of houses near the water outside the Three Mountains and other gates, called collapsing houses, to store merchants' goods. During the Yongle period, he ordered the establishment of inns and collapsing houses in various places. Collapsing houses are today's warehouses; all hoarded goods must be stored in warehouses, so they are called collapsing goods, referring to the goods in the warehouse. Not all goods in the warehouse are hoarded goods, but the goods stored in the warehouse are often large quantities, and the hoarded goods must be stored in the warehouse in large quantities. This is the origin of calling hoarded goods collapsing goods. Today's merchants only know that it is so, but they do not know why, so I reveal it here. (The End)

Economic Industry Talk, originally meant to fill in the gaps and adjust the readers' eyesight, so it occasionally publishes one or two articles to help the conversation. Fortunately, since its publication, although it has been intermittent, it has still attracted the attention of some readers. Due to the limited space of this magazine, except for "Hoarding," which was arranged into rice last month, and what has been published should still be continued, it will no longer be published in this magazine in the future. Moreover, what has been published is only a glimpse of the whole, which is not enough to sully the eyes of the readers, and I am also afraid that it is not enough to satisfy the readers' expectations; I hope that there will be an opportunity to publish and print it all in the future, and then ask the readers for a complete criticism, which is interesting.

### Dried Shrimp Prices Drop

Due to the high market price of dried shrimp, the price has recently dropped significantly. Yesterday, the selling price of Jinjun tail was 900 yuan, Tianbian tail was 850 yuan, Chaobian tail was 1,150 yuan, Longxudao tail was 880 yuan, and Jiangbei Kaiyang was 450 yuan.

### No Need to Worry About Sugar: What's the Use of Hoarding Sugar?

Successive shipments of sugar arriving in Shanghai have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the Taikoo Company's Bei Hai vessel arrived in port on Saturday (4th), carrying 1,600 bags of sugar from Hong Kong, and docked at the Puxi Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. In addition, the Jinan vessel arrived in Shanghai this Sunday (5th), also carrying 1,350 bags of sugar from Hong Kong, and docked at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. Furthermore, Jardine Matheson's Dingsheng vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying 300 bags of sugar from Hong Kong, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. It is said that a large batch of Dutch sugar has arrived in Hong Kong. Due to yesterday's Autumn Festival holiday, accurate numbers will only be reported today. (Zu)

### Autumn Festival Hardware Sales Lackluster

Since the Mid-Autumn Festival, the metal market has been quiet after silver and money businesses, foreign firms and various large and small factories closed for the holiday. Metal transactions are few and far between. The large-scale intake of factories in this street is restricted by customs closure, and sales are lacking. Moreover, foreign customers' purchases before the festival have already stopped, and it is difficult to have further intentions during this holiday period. Therefore, due to the solitary sales, the standards of various metal goods have not shown significant rises or falls. Yesterday, the market price of two-pound black iron billets was 5,200-5,300 yuan per bundle, 8-16 gauge white lead wire was 240-250 yuan per picul, Canadian blue lead was 690 yuan, and Cellpi lead was 620-630 yuan.

### Chestnut

— Gao Jiannong

The chestnut is a deciduous tree belonging to the beech family, with a trunk four or five zhang high, leaves that are long and elliptical with pointed ends, resembling arrowheads, with sharp serrated edges, and white fluff on the underside. It blooms unisexual flowers in May, which are yellow-white, with male and female flowers on the same tree. The male flowers are arranged in catkins, and the female flowers usually grow in clusters of three, wrapped in an involucre, sprouting from the base of the male flower spikes. The fruit is a nut, contained within a cupule that develops from the involucre. The cupule, with its spiky, urchin-like appearance, is prickly to the touch. When the fruit matures in autumn, it vigorously bursts open the cupule and leaps out, like a small bomb exploding: the "chestnut falling" mentioned in the Greater Dai Ritual, and the "chestnut scattering" mentioned in the Eastern Han Records, both refer to this phenomenon of seed dispersal, which shows the ancients' careful observation of things.

Where is the chestnut's homeland? This question cannot and need not be discussed, because it has long been widely distributed throughout the Eurasian continent since prehistoric times—also in the New World—and where can we trace the traces of this spread? According to the most reliable documents in our country: the two sentences in the Bin Feng Dong Shan chapter of the Book of Songs, "There are gourds on the mound, steaming in the chestnut firewood," are the works of the Duke of Zhou in the 12th century BC: the phrase "The tribute of women is no more than hazelnuts, chestnuts, dates, and dried meat" in the 24th year of the Duke Zhuang of Zuo Zhuan, is the speech of Yu Sun in 670 BC; as for the Tang Feng of the Book of Songs "There is varnish on the mountain, and chestnuts in the swamp", the Yong Feng "Planting hazelnuts and chestnuts", the Nei Ze of the Book of Rites "Children serve their parents, wives serve their parents-in-law, sweetening them with dates, chestnuts, malt sugar, and honey", and the various sentences in the Zhou Rites and the Book of Etiquette, all prove that our people have known how to eat this "gold-like, white jade-like" chestnut for many years.

Since the history of the chestnut is so ancient, and the chestnut's footprint is so broad, why do people now habitually like "Liangxiang Chestnuts"? Why has the name "Liangxiang" almost become synonymous with chestnuts? I have tried to read through the records of our country since ancient times, and I want to understand its origins by getting to the bottom of things! As a result, I know that this name has only existed since the Southern Song Dynasty, and before that, there is not a trace of it! Moreover, there are several cities famous for producing good chestnuts, some of which are older than Liangxiang, but all of them have been eliminated and disappeared! It can be seen that this little bit of false fame, which is irrelevant to reality and unimportant, also seems to be predestined, and cannot be forced by people or things themselves (To be continued)

### The Last Three Months

— Wu Dai

I heard that not long ago, a US movie was shown in Shanghai. The story in the movie was about a person suffering from heart disease. The doctor told him that he only had three months left to live. This startled and worried the patient, who thought that he should do something beneficial to society in these short three months, so as not to waste his life. As a result, he killed someone who was harmful to society. After the case was discovered, he was sentenced to death.

Later, it was said that in a summer conference at a Christian university, some students brought up the interesting topic of "If I could only live for three more months" for discussion, and everyone freely expressed their opinions. As a result, there were many different opinions. Some people sympathized with the patient in the movie, some people opposed it, and others suggested their own ways of using the last three months.

If one could only live for three more months, then those last days would certainly be very precious. If we really knew the date of our death, then we would definitely find a way to make good use of the remaining time. This is something that everyone would do. However, most people do not know the end of their lives, and that is where the mystery of life lies. Our life is short, but at the same time, it seems to have no end. This makes prudent people live an alert life, and lazy people live a muddled life. Prudent people are constantly trying to make the most of their precious life, and in their last three months, they do not need to be anxious or change their life plan. Therefore, the most successful people still live their normal lives in their last three months.

Women

### Autumn Lament

— Bai Mei

Ladies, Be Careful of Your Future

When Miss Jin triumphantly caused her principal to divorce his wife, she was overjoyed, thinking she would certainly grow old with the principal. Wasn't it so? The day of their public wedding at the Youth Association was truly a happy day! Because from that day on, she would be the official principal's wife. However, the previous principal's wife, before the divorce, had spoken to her, telling her: They had also married out of love, and when they married, they had both just graduated from middle school. To advance her husband's future, she had sacrificed her own chance to attend university, using her father's inheritance to support her husband through university. She herself became an elementary school teacher, supporting herself and her elderly mother. Only after her husband graduated, worked for several years, and saved some money, was he able to start the current school. Now, her husband's inconstancy was simply because he had some stinking money. For the sake of her elderly mother and a newborn baby, the principal's wife begged her to stand in the position of a woman and not destroy another's family. But Miss Jin cleverly denied everything. "Principal's wife, you're mistaken. How could I interfere in your family affairs?"

Time passed quickly. One year, two years, three years. The elderly mother of the abandoned principal's wife passed away due to sorrow. The child also left his mother, following his grandmother. At this time, the pitiful woman, stimulated by the separation and death of her husband, mother, and beloved child, became completely disillusioned and devoted herself to the Buddha, with neither love nor hate for anyone.

During these three years, Miss Jin, the new principal's wife, naturally lived a very comfortable life. She had once conceived a child of love, but it soon died. However, now a second precious baby had been born. Just before the birth of this second baby, the principal's heart changed again for some reason. Perhaps another lady had captured his heart! The current principal's wife felt a nameless panic in her heart. Initially, due to the principal's coldness, they often argued. Later, they even resorted to violence. Recalling three years ago, Miss Jin often wept bitterly.

Happiness, at some point, quietly left Miss Jin. Now, she was accompanied only by constant depression. However, the principal did not change his mind at all due to her depression. Instead, he became even more intimate with another lady. Whenever the sun set, Miss Jin leaned against the railing, softly singing a sad autumn song, while the principal and another lady were busily going in and out of theaters and dance halls. "Be patient! Maybe he will have a change of heart one day," Miss Jin often consoled herself.

When the second child was just over a month old, the principal and his wife had another major argument over a minor matter. The principal finally announced his final decision and proposed a divorce. Miss Jin's beautiful dream was now completely shattered. Reason told her to argue it out with the principal: "Why do you want to divorce me?" "Because I don't love you anymore!" "Then why did you love me before?" "That was then, this is now!" Miss Jin was so angry that she couldn't say anything. "Just sign the divorce papers, take a few thousand dollars, and be done with it. Why bother talking so much? Wasn't the previous wife a good example?" The principal pressed further. "Let me consider it for a while," Miss Jin said. The question of divorce was temporarily put on hold, awaiting Miss Jin's consideration.

To agree or not to agree? Became the battle in Miss Jin's mind. "The previous wife..." How long ago was it? She herself had become the previous wife. Before the previous wife's divorce, she had asked her to stand in the position of a woman and not destroy another's family. Should she also go talk to the future principal's wife? "Who can interfere in your family affairs?" This imagined answer made her lose courage. Leaning against the railing and singing a sad autumn song had become Miss Jin's only pastime in recent months.

### Black Lungs

— Shen Xiong

The normal color of human lungs is light red, but the residents of large cities have black lungs. Dr. Darlington, after dissecting many corpses in New York, said that their lungs were as black as the night. Another doctor said that the lungs of New Yorkers were as black as coal.

In fact, the lungs of residents of major cities around the world are not much more beautiful than those of New Yorkers. Because this is an unfortunate consequence of modern civilization. People want to enjoy material civilization, and can only endure this misfortune for the time being. Living anywhere, city or countryside, you can keep your conscience clear; but you cannot avoid breathing air. So you can only let your lungs be blackened day by day.

Because when you go outdoors for so-called fresh air, you are actually breathing foul air full of germs and smoke.

According to Dr. Blackwell of Milwaukee, it is estimated that nearly 150 tons of dust fall in that city per square mile in a single month. A person's lungs will be as black as coal after living in this city for only five years.

Because the air is full of smoke and gas, the ultraviolet rays emitted from the sun are severely affected, and the health of infants is also affected, even requiring cod liver oil for nourishment.

The only remedy now is to go to the suburbs and countryside often, and to live in higher houses. But isn't this just a dream for Shanghai residents?

### Lightless Torch

— Ke Zhong

Engineers at the General Electric Company of America have recently invented a "lightless" electric torch that allows cities enforcing blackout regulations not to be completely dark, while enemy aircraft still cannot detect its light. This light is a three-watt argon lamp, emitting only one candle of light, while ordinary street lights are four thousand candles. This invisible light contains ultraviolet rays, which only become bright when shone on fluorescent paint. If the road curbs are painted with fluorescent paint and illuminated with argon lamps, pedestrians and drivers can see clearly, but aircraft cannot.

### Solar Eclipse in Chongqing

— Ze Nan

The solar eclipse on the twenty-first day of the ninth month was a rare phenomenon of the century, so it was not only an opportunity for scientific observation, but also a rare visual feast for the general public. The situation of the solar eclipse observed in Shanghai has been detailed in various newspapers. Now, we have received a letter from a friend in the accompanying capital, describing the results of the observation in Chongqing on that day, which is excerpted to share with readers.

"The observation of the solar eclipse on September 21st was preceded by light rain the night before, but by the morning of the 21st, the clouds suddenly cleared, and the sunlight was very bright between 9:00 am and 12:00 pm. Although there were occasional cloud cover, it did not hinder the observation, so a simple observation was made. The result was that the number of sunspots was found to be 6. During the maximum eclipse, the temperature under the sunlight dropped to 25 degrees Celsius (approximately 77 degrees Fahrenheit). When the sun was fully restored, the temperature under the sunlight rose to 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit), a difference of as much as 30 degrees. The temperature rose and fell by two or three degrees every five minutes. As for the air temperature, there was only a three-degree difference (Celsius) before and after the eclipse. The change in air pressure was very slight, only 0.3 hao."

Thirteen Wandering to Shanghai

This lengthy explanation effectively removed most of Qiu Haitang's worries.

"Dad really, when I and Meng Lao Zhang were getting ready to leave, even that Shang Lao Er's attitude was much better than before!" When Zou Yukun was lighting a cigarette, Mei Xi finally couldn't help but interject.

"Why is that?" Qiu Haitang's confusion was genuine, he felt the matter was truly strange.

"This is the benefit of me, your second brother, doing things for you without any ambiguity!" He held a cigarette between the fingers of his right hand, with a rather smug look, and said: "Shang Lao Er's daring to mess around like that was nothing more than for two things: first, because he was poor. When a person is desperately poor, they can't help but want to find every possible way to make money; second, he only knew that you were also someone who had worked in the theater, but he didn't know that we were students of the Yuzhen Troupe. With so many fellow disciples from our Yuzhen Troupe, could he deal with them? So, on the day Lao Meng set off, I immediately wrote a letter to Tang Zhenxiang without your knowledge -- that is, the one from our next class who sings old men roles very well -- telling him to send someone to find Shang Lao Er, first give him two hundred dollars, and honestly tell him who Mei Bao's father is, tell him not to let greed cloud his mind, or he won't be able to make a living anywhere in the future! Little Tang had also received favors from me in the past, and had even performed in a few shows with you, wouldn't he do his best to handle it after receiving the letter? As soon as I saw Mei Bao and Little Gouzi come back, I knew that Shang Lao Er's side was already taken care of. Otherwise, could things have gone so quickly if we had just sent Old Meng alone?"

Hearing this, Qiu Haitang was so grateful that he didn't know what to do. (230)

### Evening Prayer Four One-Act Plays

— Naohiko

Readers who have read Zhu Leijun's "Flying for the Motherland" probably have some impression! This book sold very well, and the number of performances was also quite high. "Evening Prayer" is his second collection of one-act plays, recently published. "Evening Prayer" contains four one-act plays:

(1) "Mr. Madouling's Class" is a new type of comedy, telling the story of an old and kind middle school teacher who opposes cramming-style forced education and strives to promote reforms in a school with extremely poor material conditions. As a result, he encounters obstacles everywhere and makes countless jokes. The play culminates in a neurotic student proposing to the principal's daughter, causing the principal to fly into a rage. The author puts a lot of effort into embellishment, leaving people in admiration.

(2) "Evening Prayer" is similar in style to "Flying for the Motherland." The story unfolds on a quiet and magnificent stage: The newly appointed Minister of Civil Affairs of Lithuania brings a revolutionary party member awaiting trial into his home. This person is none other than Ke Lai, the former lover of the Minister's wife. The Minister allows them a quarter of an hour to talk. Ke Lai is very understanding of his wife's predicament and shows no resentment during the conversation. However, Dai Ni (the Minister's wife), encouraged by a dual love, cleverly swaps the poisoned wine intended for Ke Lai and dies by taking poison amid the desolate and tragic sounds of the evening prayer bells.

(3) "Mi Chao" is also a comedy. The old master is busy hoarding goods, and the wife is busy playing mahjong. As a result, they lose both their wealth and their people, and the young master is kidnapped. The wife, who represents urban women, is the most wonderful character in the play, busy with both hanging herself and playing mahjong with a clean slate.

(4) "Red Mansion's Second You" is an extremely beautiful literary exercise. Although the author has specified that the play cannot be performed, the writer believes that it is the most successful in terms of plot and dialogue.

It is worth promoting that the author's attitude towards theater is very serious. He always stays close to the bottom level, working tirelessly. He has neither the ambition to reach the hall of elegance nor the expectation of reward, so these plays are completely written for small theater groups.

### Qingyun Chess Club Established

The Qingyun Chess Club, which has been in preparation for a long time, has now been established. Its purpose is to connect friendships and discuss chess skills. It has three sections: Chinese chess, Go, and international chess. Famous masters are hired to guide, and there is a Chinese chess challenge and master performances. Fellow enthusiasts are welcome to join the club.

Sketches of Movie Stars

### (24) Mickey Rooney

— Xiao Lang

He was crowned movie emperor last year, and still holds the highest box office record. This success is by no means accidental, so his acting skills have reached the highest level. He appeared on stage with his parents in a comedy when he was eleven months old. At the age of four, he played a small role in the play "Not to be Trusted," which was very suitable for his innate conditions. He first stepped onto the screen at the age of five. It was not until he starred in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" that he began to attract attention. Now he has leaped to the top of Hollywood. He is very fond of music, especially playing the kettle drums very well. Unfortunately, he cannot grow taller, which everyone regrets for him. He often goes to social events with Linda Darnell, and seems to be thinking about love. His recent work is "Boys Town," co-starring with Spencer Tracy.

### Shanghai Drama School's "A Marriage of Wits" Highlights

— Wei

There are many family ethics plays in Peking Opera, all of which express the love between husband and wife in detail. For example, the old couple in "Qingfeng Pavilion" can care for each other during arguments; the middle-aged couple in "Baolian Lantern," while protecting their children, can still remember "Don't hurt our relationship over two servants"; the young couple in "Selling Horses," the scene of writing the complaint, the situation in the boudoir, is gentle as a painting, especially touching, and the most intoxicating is "A Marriage of Wits," which depicts the feelings of young men and women in the boudoir in great detail, and is a rare masterpiece. Xun Huisheng and Xiao Cuihua each have their own strengths in this play. It is a pity that they are getting old. Although their acting skills are good, it seems inappropriate for people in their forties to pretend to be young children. The entire play has eight books, from visiting the son-in-law to farming, and takes sixteen hours to perform. All the highlights are only seen in the scenes of teaching darts, telling jokes, bidding farewell, and going down the mountain, so ordinary performances that are not complete are all named after "Male and Female Darts." The other day, I watched the students of the drama school perform this play. Zhang Zhengfang played Di Yunluan, and Xue Zhengkang played Lu Kunjie. The young couple were pleasing to the eye. Zhang Zhengfang's strength can directly chase Huisheng. In the teaching darts scene, the dialogue is completely based on improvisation. The arguments about teachers and "girls versus boys" are the most difficult to say fluently. If you are not careful, you will stumble. Those with weak articulation dare not try it lightly. Shang Xiaoyun's "Male and Female Darts" used Xiao Cuihua to play Di Yunluan in the past, but now it is played by Furongcao. Xun Huisheng's "A Marriage of Wits" cannot shine without Lang Xiayu of Furongcao. Therefore, only Tong Shan can master both Yunluan and Xiayu. On that day, the two scenes of saying goodbye to the mother and arguing at home were the most tense. Gu Zhengqiu's cry of "My son, where are you!" moved the entire audience. Zhang Zhengfang's kneeling and reporting section showed the tenderness of mother and daughter and the love between husband and wife. She was reluctant to leave her mother, but also reluctant to abandon her husband, and cried softly, which was very touching. The little girl can already act, which is very cute. The most commendable thing is that she entered the stage on high clogs from beginning to end. This shows that the students of the opera school do not cut corners. Lian Quan is old, and Mao Shilai's stilt skills dominated for a while. If Zhengfang works hard and makes progress, she will not be taken lightly five years from now. Gu Zhengqiu is a special talent of the drama school. Her talent is beyond her peers. Her roles as Qingyi have been well-received by society. Her performance as Lang Xiayu is excellent. The farewell scene is very moving. She is somewhat similar to Xiaoyun, which is not achieved in a day. The other supporting roles are also well-arranged. After watching the play, I have great expectations for the future of the drama school.

As long as I go, he will not dare to release my father." Then he waved for the messenger to leave. The next morning, another scout from the capital rushed back, reporting into the tent. Sangui saw that the scout looked a little flustered, and hesitated to speak. He quickly opened his mouth and asked, "Is Mrs. Chen well?" The scout replied, "Unfortunately, Mrs. Chen was captured by Chuang's general Liu Zongmin and offered to the King of Hell." When Sangui heard this, it was as if a ladle of cold water had been poured over his head, and he did not know whether he felt sour, pain, bitter, or spicy. The pain was more piercing than hearing the bad news of Emperor Chongzhen's martyrdom, and there was no way to describe it. He immediately jumped up, pointed at the scout, and asked, "You... you... are you sure you are not mistaken? How was Mrs. Chen captured by Li Chuang? You must not falsely report this matter, and you must find out the details clearly." The scout was terrified to see Sangui so anxious, and carefully said, "I dare not falsely report, I came to report after I found out the details. When Li Chuang broke into the palace, countless palace people committed suicide or fled. The remaining palace women were all of ordinary beauty. Li Chuang then asked the eunuchs, why are there no beautiful women among the three thousand in the imperial garden? The eunuchs replied that the late emperor shunned sensuality, so there were not many beauties in the palace, except for a Jiangnan beauty named Chen Yuanyuan, who possessed peerless beauty. The state father Tian once offered her to the emperor, but the emperor did not favor her because he was worried about state affairs, and sent her back to the Tian family. Later, I heard that Tian gave her to General Wu. After hearing this, Li Chuang asked the old general for her. The old general was initially unwilling to give her up, but later Chuang's general Liu Zongmin searched the house, and Mrs. Chen hid in the hidden wall."
