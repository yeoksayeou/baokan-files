### Japanese Diplomatic Policy Wanders Astray: Konoe Cabinet Resigns En Masse for the Third Time

The Emperor Orders Temporary Assumption of State Affairs Pending Future Appointments; Konoe Restores Special Cabinet Meeting That Evening

Reuters, Tokyo, 16th (Urgent Telegram) – The Japanese cabinet led by Konoe has resigned en masse. The reason is due to a lack of sufficient consensus on the means of implementing national policy. After obtaining the consent of all cabinet members, Konoe proceeded to the palace to submit the cabinet's resignation. According to an official announcement issued by the Information Bureau, Konoe separately invited each cabinet member to his official residence to explain the reasons for the cabinet's resignation.

Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th – The third Konoe cabinet, which had been in office for only three months, resigned en masse today. Konoe has presented the letters of resignation of all cabinet members to the Emperor. According to Domei News Agency, the resignation of the cabinet was due to the inability of cabinet members to fully agree on the methods to be followed in pursuing Japanese national policy. Prime Minister Konoe presented the resignation letters of all cabinet members to the Emperor at 5 p.m. Previously, he had met with each cabinet member separately to discuss the resignation issue. The third Konoe cabinet was the fifth cabinet since the start of the Sino-Japanese War and was considered the most moderate cabinet after the Sino-Japanese War.

Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th – The third Konoe cabinet, established on July 18, resigned today under pressure from nationalist elements to halt Japanese-U.S. peace talks. After the resignation, the Emperor ordered Prime Minister Konoe to continue handling state affairs pending further instructions. Konoe enjoys great public support throughout the country, so it is generally expected that the new cabinet will also be formed by Konoe. After receiving the order, Konoe convened a special cabinet meeting at 8 p.m. to report the Emperor's wishes. The Information Bureau declared that the cabinet decided to resign due to disagreements on national policy. Therefore, Konoe obtained the consent of his members before presenting the letters of resignation to the Emperor at 5 p.m.

Reuters, Tokyo, 16th – At the official cabinet meeting held at the Prime Minister's official residence this morning, Foreign Affairs official Tsubame will explain the development of the Soviet Union.

Reuters, Tokyo, 16th – According to Japanese news agency reports, Prime Minister Konoe, key minister Kido, and Cabinet Planning Board Director Lieutenant General Suzuki discussed serious events yesterday afternoon. This meeting was held after Konoe entered the palace to see the Emperor. Konoe had also entered the palace on Tuesday to report on various matters. Before entering the palace yesterday, Konoe met with Lieutenant General Suzuki and held talks with Interior Minister Tanabe for an hour. After a special meeting, the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee sent a resolution to the Prime Minister, endorsing the government's foreign policy but strongly urging the government to take a firm stance in negotiations with the United States. Members of the Toa League also visited Konoe and Foreign Minister Toyoda to present the party's resolution on U.S.-Japan negotiations.

Reuters, Tokyo, 16th – According to Japanese news agency reports, the cabinet meeting scheduled for today, due to tomorrow being a holiday, has been canceled without explanation.

Reuters, London, 16th – Here, the resignation of the Japanese Third Konoe Cabinet is met with surprise. While there is no news yet about the reasons for the resignation, the general opinion is that it is largely due to the failure of U.S.-Japan negotiations and the divergence of opinions between conservatives and pro-Axis factions regarding actions against the Soviet Union. People here believe that Japan is currently wandering down a divergent path and are closely watching the future development of the Japanese political situation.

### Australian Cabinet Convenes to Discuss Delicate Situation

Issues Warning of Extreme Concern Regarding Newly Established Japanese-Portuguese Air Route

Mines Laid in Several Locations Along Australia's Northeast Coast

Associated Press, Canberra, 16th – Australia is increasingly concerned about the planned air route between Japan and Portugal. The war cabinet and leaders of the navy, army, and air force convened a special meeting today to discuss the delicate situation. It is understood that important decisions have been reached but have not yet been announced. These decisions will be submitted to the War Advisory Committee, which will convene tomorrow. British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East, Sir Brooke Popham, will also attend tomorrow's meeting.

Reuters, Brisbane, 16th – According to an announcement by the Australian Navy, mines have been laid in all passages of the Great Barrier Reef between Arlington Reef and Ankor Bay off the coast of Queensland. On Thursday, four mine areas were also laid west of the island. The island is located at the entrance to the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea.

Reuters, Melbourne, 16th – Today, the War Advisory Council discussed the incident of Japan's newly established air route to Timor. The British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East, Brooke Popham, also attended the meeting. This meeting was a continuation of yesterday's discussions between the war cabinet and the leaders of the three armed services. According to responsible sources, the Australian Federation has telegraphed other Pacific governments for their views on Japan's establishment of this air route and pointed out the significance of this air route, which would allow Japanese aircraft to fly close to the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and British territories in the Pacific. People here believe that the announcement of the laying of mine areas along the Great Barrier Reef and the Queensland coast, as well as the urgent order for Australian Ambassador to the United States Casey to remain in Washington, are all warnings to Japan, showing Australia's concern over this matter.

Associated Press, Washington, 16th – Navy Secretary Knox criticized the establishment of the new air route between Japan and Portugal yesterday, making inferences. Knox stated that the Japanese Navy's actions around the world provide a broad overview of the situation, which is an important factor in the Far East issue. Although Tokyo has issued warnings in the past, supplies transported by the United States to Vladivostok have not been obstructed in any way. The Navy Secretary also stated that this air route was not built for commercial purposes. It is noteworthy that Japan was able to buy off Portugal and obtain landing rights for aircraft. This air route is 500 miles away from the Philippines, which is very far, so it is impossible to observe it.

Havas, Marseille, 15th – Japan and Portugal have concluded an aviation agreement stipulating the establishment of an air route between the Japanese-mandated island of Palau in the Pacific Ocean and the eastern part of Portuguese Timor. The Australian aviation community is paying close attention to this, stating that although the new agreement has low value in terms of commerce, Japanese aircraft can now easily appear near Australia and the Dutch East Indies, which is indeed a dangerous matter.

### U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Approves Arming Merchant Ships

House to Begin Debate Today, Expected to Pass Tomorrow Evening

Associated Press, Washington, 16th – The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved amendments to the Neutrality Act yesterday, allowing U.S. merchant ships to be armed. Navy Secretary Knox stated that the U.S. Navy is prepared to equip cannons and train crew members on U.S. merchant ships when authorized by Congress. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved this bill after debates by senior government and defense officials. The bill is scheduled to begin debate on Thursday and is expected to pass on Friday evening. Knox stated that he believes it will take several months to complete the arming of U.S. merchant ships because we cannot decide to recall all ships from the sea at once. He believes that once U.S. ships are armed, German submarines will change their methods of attack. He stated that submarines may use mines, lurking underwater, rather than attacking and sinking ships on the surface with cannons. If merchant ships implement the installation of anti-aircraft guns, German aircraft will also be forced to fly high, reducing the chance of hitting. He stated that U.S. merchant ships will use three- to five-inch cannons, requiring twelve gunners.

### Tefft C. Corbitt Returns to Singapore

Reuters, Calcutta, 16th – Tefft C. Corbitt and his wife departed for Singapore today. Yesterday, Corbitt visited a Buddhist temple near Darjeeling. The monks of the temple offered special prayers and expressed hope that Britain would soon achieve final victory.

### Japanese Navy Spokesman Claims U.S.-Japan Relations Are Becoming More Critical; Fleet Is Prepared for War Against the U.S.

Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th – Navy spokesman Colonel Hiraide declared last night that U.S.-Japan relations are extremely critical, but he stated that the Japanese Navy is currently in perfect condition and is becoming increasingly strong. The Asahi Shimbun stated that Hiraide's declaration is extremely important because it is the Navy's first decision to express its attitude and determination toward U.S.-Japan relations. The Asahi Shimbun prominently published Hiraide's speech delivered in Saikyo last night. In that speech, he warned the audience that although the Japanese government and diplomatic personnel are doing their best, U.S.-Japan relations have reached a "final crossroads." He stated that the entire Japanese nation must have a firm determination. The spokesman added, "The Japanese Navy is in excellent condition, is currently becoming stronger, and has completed preparations for war." The following are the main points of Hiraide's speech: "The United States has done its best to assist the Soviet Union. We cannot predict what impact this will have on Japan. However, the Soviet Union is currently engaged in fierce battles in the west, so it is doing its best to avoid conflict with Japan. Once the United States implements escorting between Iceland and the British Isles, Germany will challenge the neutrality of U.S. warships, and the result will affect U.S.-Japan relations." He stated that the United States is massively expanding its navy, but it cannot currently fight in two major oceans at the same time. Hiraide stated, "The Japanese Navy is extremely strong and is becoming stronger. This trend may help to consider whether a U.S.-Japan war can be avoided. As of the current situation, the imperial maritime force is ready." He stated, "In fact, the Japanese Navy is eager to take action." He also stated that once the U.S. and Japan go to war, the "certain country's navy" in the Pacific will wage guerrilla warfare, destroy commerce, and bomb Japan. He stated that the China-U.S.-Britain-Netherlands encirclement line is expected to be established for this purpose, but its base is located elsewhere (it is not known whether he implied that the Soviet Union would participate in the war or that U.S. aircraft would use the Soviet Union as a base). Hiraide also briefly estimated the number of bombers that could bomb Japan from the nearest point. Regarding the destruction of commerce, he stated that the maximum losses will be several times less than the losses of German attacks on British ships. He stated that although the government has made various efforts, the current situation has reached a crossroads. Our country's fate depends entirely on how we act at present, so it is regarded as the time for the Navy to implement its initial mission."

Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th – The Information Bureau declared that the Privy Council has approved the government's plan to reduce university courses by six months so that students can graduate early to fulfill their military service obligations. This move is clearly the so-called "important decision" of the Privy Council. If this method is implemented, graduates will be able to serve in important positions earlier and be consistent with the government's recent measures to strengthen the war effort to cope with the so-called unprecedented crisis in the world.

British-Japanese relations will worsen further

Associated Press, London, 16th – A reliable observer believed yesterday that British-Japanese relations would worsen further because Germany had appointed its envoy to Bolivia, Winterler, as its envoy to Thailand, and said that a certain high-ranking German secret police officer had also been sent to Thailand to carry out new tasks. According to the report, the secret police officer had been an advisor to the Minister of Home Affairs.

### $50 Billion Military Program

International News Service, Washington, 16th – Production Management Director Knudson told Congress yesterday that the U.S.'s $50 billion military program would be completed by the end of 1943. According to the report, this program has been underway for some time, and once completed, it will make the United States the owner of the most powerful land, sea, and air forces in the world.

International News Service, Washington, 16th – Yesterday, it was learned that the government requested that the defense program progress at a high speed, such as arming merchant ships, doubling military expenditures, and doubling defense production. The result of all of this will be a fundamental change in the army's personnel. Recently, the United States held field exercises. The high command's first decision took the opportunity to test whether most officers could implement modern "blitzkrieg" tactics. Army officials privately admitted that this exercise exposed some weaknesses that needed to be corrected urgently. Several dozen officers had already been ordered to retire voluntarily, and those who had been called up from the reserves were also ordered to be discharged, and their names were not disclosed.

### Thais Prepare to Sacrifice to Defend Their Country

Reuters, Bangkok, 16th – The Bangkok Bulletin, a Thai-run newspaper, published an editorial with three columns titled "Love Peace and Be Prepared," which is a stern warning to those who intend to invade. General observers attach great importance to it. After stating that Thailand loves peace and has equal friendship with all countries, the newspaper stated that if the country is threatened by any party, then more than 300,000 brave men, equipped with the latest warfare equipment, are prepared to sacrifice to defend the country for the sake of national independence. In addition, there are hundreds of thousands of people who have received military training and are currently engaged in peaceful occupations. Once there is an alarm, they will join the national defense. Apart from this, there are still millions of people who do not fear death.

Reuters, Bangkok, 16th – Thailand's famous daily newspaper, Prachachat, claimed that British authorities on the Malayan border continue to provide Thais with various conveniences for entry and exit, while openly carrying out their defense works, which shows that Britain's defense is not aimed at attacking Thailand.

### About 500 Coastal Factories Relocated Inland After the War

Distributed in Sichuan, Hunan, Shaanxi, Guizhou, etc.; estimated by Wu Jingchao, Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs

Chongqing – Regarding the number of coastal factories relocated inland after the war, estimates from various parties vary. According to the new book by economic expert Wu Jingchao, a total of 448 factories were relocated. Wu is currently the Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and his basis is formal reports. Among them, 254 came to Sichuan, 121 to Hunan, 72 to Shaanxi, 23 to Guizhou, and the remaining 23 were distributed in other inland areas. The total amount of machinery moved in by the factories was 120,000 tons, and there were 12,000 skilled workers. According to Wu's statistics, as of the previous year, there were 4,277 factories registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, while in 1931 there were only 475. In 1881, the total value of China's imports and exports was only 120 million taels, but last year it had increased to 23 billion yuan. Wu discussed the economic development of the new China, which reached its peak in 1937, but Japan's invasion did not seal its fate. On the contrary, it has promoted the rise of inland industry.

### Conjecture About Southward or Northward Advance; Japan to Adopt New Offensive Against China

China Should Launch Full-Scale Counteroffensive to Shatter Japanese Plans; Sun Ke Warns the Nation to Take Active Steps Immediately

Hong Kong – Dr. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, recently wrote an article in the newspapers, stating that Japan is currently planning to launch a new offensive against western China, rather than advancing north to attack the Soviet Union or advancing south to expand territory. Sun stated that the recent battles in northern Hunan and the crossing of the Xinqiang River are preludes to the Japanese army's westward advance. After this, a massive offensive will follow. He also said, "Some observers are constantly speculating that the Japanese army will advance north or south, hoping that they will therefore withdraw some of their troops in China. However, this idea is harmful to China's resistance. In order to cope with the Japanese army's westward offensive, China must take active steps and launch a counteroffensive. The Battle of Changsha has become China's initial victory. After this, we must continue to launch a fierce counteroffensive on the entire front to shatter the Japanese army's plans." Sun also said that General Li Zongren recently advocated concentrating a large army to recover Guangdong. Li's proposal is currently the most urgent task. Once Guangdong is recovered, important international lines of communication can be reopened. On the one hand, China can obtain military raw materials from this, and on the other hand, it can seize the Japanese army's strongholds in central China. Sun then issued four points of advocacy, believing that freedom-loving people from advancing nations of the world should (1) assist China and the Soviet Union, who are fighting against aggressor nations, (2) provide effective assistance to countries that are being enslaved, (3) Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union should jointly stop Japan's actions in the Pacific and completely disarm it, and Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union should fight side by side in Europe and disarm the aggressors Germany and Italy.

### Mrs. Li Zongren Speaks About the Situation at the Front Lines

Chongqing - Mrs. Guo Dejie, wife of Commander Li Zongren, recently arrived in Chongqing from the front lines and will soon depart for Guilin. Last May, Mrs. Li rushed to the front lines to handle matters of comfort and rescue. In addition to organizing women's work teams to participate in service, she also established a handicraft weaving factory. The factory can earn a net profit of over one thousand yuan per month. Mrs. Li spoke about her observations from this trip, saying that the autumn harvest in Anhui, Henan, and other provinces this year was abundant. The general cost of living at the front lines is better than in the rear. Soldiers can eat a certain amount of pork every week. What she found most pleasing was the simple folk customs and the enthusiastic spirit of fighting. However, due to inconvenient transportation and a lack of books and newspapers, she hopes that the rear can continuously provide them with spiritual sustenance and constantly encourage them.

### German and Italian Priests Expelled, Fu Will Go to Chongqing

Guilin - The authorities of Hunan Province expelled German and Italian priests in Changsha for malicious activities. The authorities have remained silent on this matter, and those seeking the truth have not learned the details. It is said that the facts must await a detailed report from Hunan Province to the central government before they can be released. A group of foreign reporters who recently visited Changsha encountered twelve expelled German and Italian priests. It is said that they will go to Chongqing with guards. The news obtained by the reporters in Changsha was scarce. According to Chinese officials, the reason is that in the four refugee shelters run by foreign churches in Changsha, only the refugee shelter run by Italian priests had refugees parading through the streets, waving Japanese flags for Japanese photographers. The Italian church insists that the refugees were forced out by Japanese soldiers. Furthermore, the Italian church in Changsha received reporters from the Japanese official news agency and welcomed the Japanese army's arrival in Changsha. According to the observations of other foreign churches, the Italian church did this to curry favor with the Japanese army. This is what the Chinese side says. The British and American churches in Changsha are quite worried about this move by the authorities, fearing that it will affect the position of all churches in Free China and that the Japanese army in the occupied areas will take retaliatory actions against the American churches. Two of the expelled German and Italian priests were unable to travel due to illness. British and American priests jointly guaranteed their behavior and will wait for them to recover before departing.

### Japanese Konoe Cabinet Resigns En Masse

The third Konoe Cabinet of Japan, since its establishment on July 17th, has only lasted for just over two months and suddenly announced its resignation en masse. The brevity of its life is not only unprecedented since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War but is also a first in the entire constitutional history of Japan. This certainly reflects the turbulent international situation and deeply exposes the political unease within Japan.

As of the time of writing, we have only learned that Konoe continues to handle state affairs, awaiting further orders. The main reasons and the process of resignation are also unknown. However, if we review the circumstances of the previous cabinet's establishment and its various measures in the past three months, it is not difficult to arrive at a reasonable judgment. The reshuffling of the Japanese cabinet in July was due to the outbreak of the Soviet-German war. Its most significant change was the replacement of Matsuoka by Toyoda. The influence of Hiranuma and the naval factions was greater than in the previous cabinet. Therefore, even though the essential nature of the Japanese cabinet's policies has not changed, it has somewhat adopted a tone of maintaining the status quo and observing the situation. Party members in the cabinet were completely excluded, and on the other hand, fascist extremists were also suppressed. Therefore, the third Konoe cabinet was unsatisfactory to radical military politicians. However, at that time, the international situation was chaotic, and Japan was repeatedly subjected to external economic and political pressure. No one had absolute certainty about future developments. Therefore, those who were dissatisfied at that time could only wait and see, and their dissatisfaction was deeply accumulated. The extreme rhetoric in Japanese newspapers, frequently published, is one proof, and the assassination of Numa on August 14th is most noteworthy. Hiranuma was a giant of the right wing in the past but has recently transformed into a stronghold of the conservative camp. The most important cabinet members in this Konoe cabinet, including the Minister of Home Affairs, the Minister of Finance, and some naval figures, all have connections with him. His position as Minister without Portfolio is, in fact, equivalent to the Deputy Prime Minister, no different from the soul of the cabinet. His assassination is naturally a blow to the entire cabinet. However, because of the news blockade, many situations are unknown to the outside world. As for the greatest political expression of this Konoe cabinet, it was only conducting negotiations with the United States, attempting to resolve the US-Japan stalemate through diplomatic means, reduce economic pressure, and resolve the "Sino-Japanese Incident." Apart from this, apart from consistent active preparation for war, there were no methods or achievements. As for advancing into Vietnam and occupying all of Vietnam, its initiation was during the tenure of the previous cabinet. The current cabinet only reaped the consequences of frozen funds and embargoes. Recently, Wakamugi Yoji returned to the United States from Japan with instructions to resume negotiations, but the United States' position has remained firm, and the international situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse, making a compromise between the United States and Japan impossible. On the other hand, the Soviet Union's failure to resist Germany has stimulated Japan's desire to advance north. Under these circumstances, the keynote of maintaining the status quo and observing the situation naturally appears inappropriate. The current cabinet itself also lacks certainty about how to deal with the current urgent situation. These factors, I believe, must be the main reason for the Japanese cabinet's resignation. The main support of the third Konoe cabinet was the naval force, and the US-Japan negotiations were also initiated by naval figures. Some time ago, no matter how radical elements clamored, the naval forces always expressed caution. However, yesterday, the Navy Ministry spokesman, Hirai Ide, suddenly reversed his previous attitude, saying that the Japanese Navy was prepared to fight the United States at any cost. This contradicts the statement made by Cabinet spokesman Ishii two days ago, which said, "The Japanese government intends to do its best to resolve the outstanding issues between the two countries peacefully through Washington-Japan talks to the very end... We must exercise patience." This is no different from a prelude to the collapse of the Japanese cabinet.

After the Konoe cabinet resigned in July, Konoe reorganized the new cabinet, which fully demonstrated the lack of leadership talent in Japan. This time, the cabinet collapsed again, and the selection of a successor is a very difficult problem. According to Tokyo telegrams, Konoe has been ordered to continue to handle state affairs, awaiting further orders. It is possible that Konoe will form a fourth cabinet, but the selection of cabinet members will inevitably be from among radical military men. Judging from past Japanese precedents, some extreme elements and radical military men often have sharp edges when they are in the opposition, but once they are in power, they inevitably restrain themselves and become cautious. This is not a change in personal position or views but is due to the current situation in Japan. Therefore, even if radical elements succeed in forming a cabinet, they may not blindly act recklessly. However, in light of the current situation, the new crisis in the Pacific has undoubtedly been further advanced with the change of the Japanese cabinet. If the Japanese radicals gain power, provocative acts will ultimately be unavoidable. This requires the utmost vigilance and preparation from democratic countries and the Soviet Union.

Japan, as a wartime country, is enduring internal and external pressures, and the instability of its domestic political situation and the frequency of cabinet changes are almost unmatched by any other warring nation. Regardless of its policies, this situation is always a major hidden worry. As for whether the cabinet changes are beneficial to Japan's current situation, the past four years have provided many examples to confirm. After the new cabinet is formed, if it truly entrusts the fate of the country to a desperate gamble, it is certainly the misfortune of the world, and its final destination is generally well known and need not be elaborated.

Grim Talks of the European War

### A True Record of the Moscow Air Raid

On two occasions, I took refuge in the embassy due to air raid alarms. When I came out of the embassy, it was precisely during the curfew hours from midnight to 4 AM, and I was stopped on the way. My Russian is terrible, and I said a lot before I could make the police understand the reason for my violation. They were always very polite, and once they verified what I said, they immediately let me go.

On the third occasion, I was returning home after dining nearby when I suddenly got lost in the dark. Although I asked people for directions, they were afraid that I was a spy, and no one was willing to answer. By the time I found my apartment, it was 11:15 PM, and I was immediately stopped by a patrolman and sent to the civil defense. We walked a long way to the police station and sat in the corridor with several Russians who had violated the curfew for over an hour. After my identity was verified by telephone, a member of the civil defense escorted me back to my apartment. That member took my arm and told me whenever there was a low spot or a muddy puddle ahead.

After the subway manager let us go, Magley and I sat on the platform. The tunnel was so crowded that we were able to refuse to enter on the pretext of it. As time went on, more and more people came out of the tunnel to walk on the platform. I couldn't hear anything, and I didn't know why we had to wait underground for so long. I went to a stone pillar, lay down on the stone floor, and fell asleep. At 4 AM the next morning, the crowd heard the all-clear signal and rushed to the escalators. I was awakened by the noise. At this time, three escalators rose simultaneously, as if to rise into the sky, creating an incredible spectacle.

When I got to the street, I couldn't see any traces of bombing. The morning newspaper said that enemy planes had come to drop incendiary bombs and bombs, and seventeen were shot down (later investigation showed twenty-one), and several houses caught fire, but by dawn, the fires had been extinguished, and there were few casualties.

This account is on the inside page of the newspaper. The entire front page of Pravda was occupied by an editorial on army and navy officers joining the Communist Party, local news on women practicing to replace male workers, and war news from the front lines. Even in terms of propaganda, the German bombing was a failure.

The air raid alarm sounded again on the second night, at the same time as the previous night. At that time, I was having dinner with a Chinese reporter, and we decided not to sleep and wait for the bombing to pass. We turned off the lights and opened the windows wide, even though regulations required all windows to be closed tightly during an air raid. We ran around the room, so that we could see the situation on both the north and south sides.

About twenty minutes after the alarm sounded, the first wave of enemy planes arrived. The searchlights began to search the sky, and we could also hear the sound of anti-aircraft guns, but it was not as fierce as the previous two nights. The lights often shone on the silver defense balloons. The German planes dropped flares, followed by incendiary bombs, like firecrackers. The searchlights were extremely effective. According to experts, they were unmatched by any other country in the world. One light shone on an enemy plane for several minutes. I was so nervous that I leaned as far out of the window as I could, almost falling down.

An incendiary bomb landed on a house across the street, and flames shot out of the roof, but it was extinguished before it could cause a disaster.

Another incendiary bomb fell on the roof of a small house below the window, but it was immediately thrown into the yard by the child watching the roof. There were women patrolling inside the house, ready for such emergencies, and they immediately put out the fire. The enemy planes scattered and were shot down fifteen. One fell in the city, largely because it was caught by an anti-aircraft balloon. Its wreckage was still lying in the street the next day. At around 3 AM, everything was quiet, and I hadn't slept for two hours, so I decided to go to bed.

The bombing on the third night began at 10 o'clock. When the alarm sounded, I was having dinner with four Englishmen in a hotel. We finished our dinner as usual, and the waiter remained calm as ever. Then we ran into an Englishman's room, stood by the window, and watched the bombing. The searchlights, anti-aircraft balloons, targeted bombs, the dazzling red little bombs, and the continuous anti-aircraft fire created an unprecedented spectacle. Forced by the artillery fire, the German planes had to fly high, 18,000 feet above the ground, so the bombing was aimless, and any damage was only to private residences.

One Englishman praised Moscow's air defense network, saying that if London had had such equipment in the first three months of the German air raids, the situation would have been very different. I also happened to hear from a member of the British delegation that Russia had learned many lessons from the war in France and had tried to avoid the mistakes made by the French.

We ventured out onto the balcony, but suddenly there was a bomb whistle, as if it had passed right by our ears. I quickly ran back into the room, threw myself onto the bed, and buried my face in the pillow. At the time, I was so dazed that I thought the pillow could resist bombs. Afterwards, I couldn't help but laugh at myself.

Around 2 o'clock, everything was quiet again, and we thought it would be best to get some sleep. The host was very generous and gave me the bed to sleep in, while he slept on the floor.

Night Scene During the Moscow Air Raid

### Fierce Battle Unfolds for Moscow-Kalinin Encirclement

Both Sides’ Air Fleets and Artillery Extremely Active, Rumors of Red Army Retreat from Odessa

Reuters London, 16th – Reuters military correspondent reports that the battle for Moscow is becoming increasingly fierce. However, the German army has not made significant progress, except in the northwest. The Soviet side acknowledges that there is fighting in Kalinin in the northwest, indicating that the German offensive is unfolding eastward, attempting to flank the Soviet positions, like a tide encircling a rock. News received by London from independent sources completely confirms the message from Moscow that the Soviet troops are resisting with great spirit. Although the Soviet army is forced to retreat step by step, there is no sign of a complete collapse of the front line. According to a special announcement from the German High Command, the battles in Bely and Vyazma are nearing their end. The Soviet forces encircled north of Bely suffered extremely heavy losses on Wednesday. The mopping-up operation in the forest area south of Bely is underway. The German forces participating in this battle can be largely transferred elsewhere to fight. 560,000 Soviet soldiers were captured, and a total of 413 Soviet artillery pieces were captured or destroyed. According to the Soviet official news agency, the main highway leading from Novgorod to Chudovo and Leningrad is now controlled by Soviet heavy artillery. This road is used by German General Leeb to transport reinforcements to Leningrad. Furthermore, Moscow Radio stated that the German forces in front of Leningrad have been forced to retreat from their positions. German forces in some areas in front of Bely are still advancing, but the speed has greatly reduced. One of the original offenders on Sunday, Lt. Gen. Luther, was indeed repelled. The enemy forces lost 30 tanks, hundreds of cars, and 10 artillery pieces, with over a thousand casualties. Winter is approaching, and the weather is turning cold in the war zone. This is a very important factor. The difficulties faced by the German forces will be more severe than those faced by their vehicles. Although the temperature in the Moscow area is not as harsh as in the Arctic, the fields, roads, and forests around Moscow are covered in white snow. Under these circumstances, soldiers with the warmest clothes, good nutrition, and strong physique are the most durable and must stay warm at night. Tanks and airplanes have great difficulty starting their engines in the morning. Winter has already arrived early even in Ukraine. The roads are snowy and muddy, hindering large-scale troop movements. This fact, combined with the strong resistance of the Soviet army, may be the reason for the slowdown in the frontline fighting. The German side's recent transfer of troops from other areas to assist in the offensive against Moscow may also be one of the reasons for the current slowdown in the frontline fighting.

United Press New York, 16th – It was heard here yesterday from official Swiss radio that the Soviet army had withdrawn from Kalinin (located 100 miles northwest of Moscow) and had begun to evacuate Odessa. It was also reported that the Soviet government had acknowledged the withdrawal from Kalinin.

German Attempt to Annihilate Red Army Fails, Casualties Reach 200,000

Havas World News Agency Swedish Capital, 15th – Military experts here say that General Timoshenko's troops are continuing to resist the German army with great strength, indicating that the main force of the army has not been surrounded and annihilated by the Germans. The German hopes of annihilating the Red Army have not been realized and have suffered heavy losses. It is estimated that the German army has suffered 200,000 deaths and 300,000 injuries in the Moscow battle. However, the German army continues to advance towards Moscow in two routes, regardless of the casualties. One route follows the Vyazma highway, heading directly towards Moscow, where fierce fighting is underway. The Soviet army has launched a counter-offensive and recaptured the city of Mozhaisk (60 miles west of Moscow). The German army is currently adopting a flanking strategy, taking the road through Medyn to flank the Soviet army. It is reported that this has forced the Soviet army to retreat. At the same time, they are also moving south from the Valdai Hills and have crossed the city of Rzhev. In addition, the German army is also dividing its troops to attack the city of Kalinin (90 miles northwest of Moscow) to cut off the Moscow-Leningrad railway. The fighting southwest of Moscow is intensifying. The Soviet troops in the area from Bely to Orel have been retreating in an orderly manner due to the pressure from the German army. Everything in Moscow is normal, but the atmosphere is tense. Women and children have been evacuated, but the diplomatic corps remains. The Finnish army in the north continues to advance. It is reported that the Soviet army has withdrawn from the city of Petrozavodsk. A group of British technical experts have arrived at the far northern port of Arkhangelsk to assist in the unloading of British and American planes sent to the Soviet Union.

### Cotton Yarn: Shenxin Mills Releases 3,000 Bales; Bullish "Double Horse" Traders Discouraged; No Export Footprints…Resale Thoughts Emerge Spontaneously

The cotton yarn market trend shows slight stability; the range of price fluctuations is not as drastic as the previous day. However, the overall situation remains firm and rising. Nevertheless, factories have released some quotas, and the bargaining chips in the market may loosen a step. Shenxin No. 9 Mill released 1,500 bales of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn, or so it is said that it had 3,000 bales, priced at 2,150 yuan, and immediate delivery orders are being issued. Due to the flat market trend at the close of the previous day, the "Double Horse" yarn opened peacefully in the morning at 2,185 yuan. Subsequently, there were no major changes on the trading floor, and it gradually loosened to 2,155 yuan. However, the exchange price was stable, and it rebounded again at the close. The factory orders then rose to 2,193 yuan. However, spot yarn transactions are still affected by the blockade and lack vitality. At the same time, it is heard that the factory has released a batch to keep the market calm, gradually loosening to 2,152 yuan at the close. The afternoon opening was still weak at 2,145 yuan. The floating bulls, seeing the factory's release, sold off slightly, dropping to 2,135 yuan. However, as the price softened, buyers became active again, fluctuating for a long time between 2,145 yuan. By the close, due to the rise in cash prices, it followed suit and rose to 2,162 yuan at the close. However, the exchange yarn and cloth prices remain weak. The transaction statistics show 15,000 bales, all intra-trade transfers.

The "Golden Double Horse" futures market shows a reverse trend, with a weak and lifeless market. The floating bulls continue to emerge, and the market lacks vitality. The weakening on the ground is being pulled up by the bulls. The morning opening was weakened by the declining trend of American cotton, and the factory orders first showed decline. Rumors spread like bees in the market, first saying that spot goods were flowing out, but then saying that they were being absorbed. For a while, it was left and right, and people were confused and unable to grasp the situation. General retail investors were forced by the atmosphere to continuously release their holdings, causing factory orders to rise and fall suddenly, eventually weakening. Therefore, futures yarn opened firmly, with the near-term contract at 1,960 yuan, the November contract at 1,958 yuan, and the December contract at 1,990 yuan. Although it rose slightly at one point due to the rise on the exchange, it ultimately softened due to the continuous selling by sellers. The afternoon closing was softened. In the afternoon, spot goods were weak again, and futures yarn followed suit, with a very strong selling atmosphere in the market. Prices fell continuously, with the near-term contract falling to 1,913 yuan, the November contract falling to 1,925 yuan, and the December contract falling to 1,9713 yuan. Although the market was quite lifeless, there were no excessive cracks in the ground. When the factory orders finally closed, there were rumors of a large amount of spot yarn being exported, and the buying wind suddenly rose. The short positions temporarily lost strength. However, because the October and November contracts had already closed, they each fell by 40-50 yuan, while the December contract fell by only 7 yuan. Whether the rumors are true remains to be seen in today's market price. A list is presented below:

October November December

Opening 1960.0 1958.0 1990.0

Highest 1965.0 1968.0 2010.0

Lowest 1913.0 1915.0 1973.0

Closing 1923.0 1945.0 1993.0

Compared to drop 57.0 Drop 49.0 Drop 7.0

### Finance: Gold Pours into the Market

Yesterday, the speculative red market continued to decline, and the cash price fell sharply, dropping below the 11,000 yuan mark. This was due to the continued loosening of foreign exchange and the renewed strong selling intentions of the Tianjin gang. The Hong Kong gang, which had been trending strongly recently, suddenly competed with the Chaozhou gang to dump huge amounts. Although a certain bank and cash shop were buying, they were limited to low prices. The price fell from 11,050 yuan to 10,700 yuan, finally falling by 410 yuan. The total transaction volume was around 2,500 taels. The October gold futures also saw limited buying due to the selling pressure from the Guangdong gang and foreign exchange shops, falling from the morning opening of 8,520 yuan to 8,270 yuan in the afternoon. Finally, Tianyuan entered the market again, rebounding to close at 8,350 yuan, still falling by 170 yuan, with a transaction volume of over 700 taels. Ornamental gold fell by 30 yuan to 1,110 yuan.

The cash price decline reignited, opening in the morning with Shihe's initial selling pressure, dropping by 200 yuan. It was then sold to Xiangxingyong and a certain bank, 50 taels each, at 11,000 yuan. It further dropped to 10,900 yuan. Chengda, Tianyuan, Xianghe, and Xiangxingyong successively absorbed the supply, immediately pushing the price up to 11,050 yuan. Suddenly, Shunyuanlai strongly released its holdings, and there were reports of a certain bank releasing its holdings. Dafeng, Fukangyong, Decheng, and Defu all sold, and the price immediately fell by 200 yuan, retreating to the 11,000 yuan mark. Shunyuan sold 20 taels to a certain bank at 10,850 yuan. Decheng then entered the market again, and Xianghe entered 20 taels from Chengji, raising the price to 10,920 yuan. At noon, there were rumors of the Japanese cabinet falling, and Shihe, Hesheng, and Xiangxingyong released their holdings again, dropping by 120 yuan. The noon closing saw Shunyuan sell 70 taels to Tianyuan at 10,800 yuan. The afternoon opening was still at 10,800 yuan. Xiangxingyong came to sell a small amount at 10,760 yuan, and a certain bank entered the market at 10,800 yuan. Later, Xianghe, Mingfeng, Tianyuan, and Xinfengyong competed to release their holdings, driving the price down by 100 yuan. Xinfengyong sold 10 taels each to Dafeng and Yongcheng at 10,700 yuan. Yongcheng, Shihe, Zhongxing, Chengji, and Xianghe heavily entered the market, while Xiangxingyong and the Hong Kong gang released huge amounts, causing the price to fluctuate between 10,710 yuan and 10,750 yuan. Xiangxingyong and Shunyuan resold at 10,700 yuan, which was bought by Hesheng, Zhongxing, Tianyuan, Decheng, Wanfeng, and Yifeng. Finally, the price was raised, and Gonghe entered 20 taels from Fukangyong, closing at 10,790 yuan, falling by 410 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. There was a fluctuation of 350 yuan on the day, and trading was brisk, totaling around 2,500 taels. The retail price of the cash shops' own brand gold was 11,000 yuan, with the buying price 300 yuan lower than the selling price.

The October futures (10 taels each) opened at 8,520 yuan in the morning at 9:30, the same as the previous day's closing price. Then, due to the successive selling pressure from Hengji, Dafeng, Hesheng, and Tianyuan, the price gradually dropped by 240 yuan due to the lack of buyers, directly retreating to 8,280 yuan at the noon closing. The afternoon opening was at 8,270 yuan. Although Dingsheng and Hecheng sold, Tianyuan and Dafeng absorbed the supply, gradually raising the price by 80 yuan. The 4:00 PM closing was at 8,350 yuan, a decrease of 170 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 250 yuan on the day.

The exchange price for gold jewelry per tael at silverware shops, Datonghang and Xintonghang both gradually dropped by 20 yuan after 10:00 AM to 1,120 yuan. At 11:00 AM, it rebounded to 1,130 yuan, then fell again by 20 yuan at noon to 1,110 yuan. It then leveled off, with the buying price reduced by 50 yuan, a decrease of 30 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Black Market Foreign Exchange Gradually Loosening

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC post its rates, but all rates remained unchanged. The counter prices at HSBC and other smaller banks were all flat. The black market rates for British and American exchange continued to loosen. Exporters and private Chinese merchants released large amounts, and foreign import companies that were not allowed to apply for foreign exchange obtained American exchange above 20,000 yuan, and it could still be settled. The noon closing was 3.75 yuan for the U.S. dollar and 2/125 for the British pound. In the afternoon, the British exchange was flat, and the U.S. dollar was at 3.875 yuan before anyone bought. The British pound rose by 0.0625 compared to the previous day, and the U.S. dollar rose by 0.125. The fact that American drafts had fallen below the 30 yuan mark was also a reason for the loosening. Trading was not quiet on the day.

### All Foreign Currencies Decline

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds fall by 10 yuan in line with the cash price. British pound drafts rebounded slightly by 1 yuan. The supply of U.S. dollar drafts from all sides remained strong, once retreating to 28.20 yuan. The final price was 28.50 yuan, a decrease of 2.20 yuan compared to the previous day. The trend of Hong Kong drafts also softened, with the market price falling by 0.10 yuan. Japanese gold drafts were still stable, with the evening market still standing at the original price of 6.60 yuan. Korean drafts fell slightly by 0.01 yuan, retreating to 6.10 yuan in the evening market. In addition, currencies such as Singapore, Anfu, Robi, and Canada also tended to weaken.

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Frequently Surge; Domestic Bonds Return to Haunt

The public bond shadow market was still very uncertain yesterday. The Sichuan gang came to sell again, both Type A and Type D, so the market price of these two types was uniquely small, while other types rebounded because of the different supply and demand. Buying and selling transactions were not prosperous, and the entry and exit of each company was also very small. However, it was heard that there will be reforms in the financial sector, and public bonds will be affected again after implementation, so let's wait and see. Yesterday morning, Zhongfu and Lianhe bought, and Houde and Hongda sold. The noon closing saw a state of unevenness. In the afternoon, Lianyi and Datong bought, and Tongkang, Binlong, and Yitai sold. The market price was slightly weak, but still uneven. The trend may not change much in the short term. The market price results were uneven with ups and downs of three to four corners and transactions of 1.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

In stock trading, 100 shares of Xinxin Company were traded at a price of 54 yuan per share.

The vitality of the public utilities stock market has not diminished, with most stocks fluctuating within a narrow range. The Xiangtai Timber Company stock rose again. The opening price was only 89 yuan, and then it gradually rose to 99.5 yuan, closing at 98 yuan. Cultivation stocks continued to surge, with the highest price reaching 61 yuan. Rubber stocks traded well, with prices fluctuating wildly.

### Food: Public Rice Available; A Fortress for People's Food

Yesterday, foreign rice continued the weak trend of the previous day, and the enthusiasm of merchants and hoarding groups remained sluggish. Although the sellers tried to raise prices, they were unwilling to easily sell, but because the public warehouses and the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) sold rice at a fixed, cheaper price, trading on the street was not greedy, and the merchants lacked demand. Hoarders, seeing that foreign rice had foreign exchange problems, and also hearing that the recent negotiations with the SMC had been agreed, coupled with the frequent arrival of goods, did not dare to collect smoothly. Therefore, the market price gradually declined after the opening. The SMC and bank stacks reached 130 yuan, and foreign stacks reached 129 yuan. Then, due to the fact that many floating accounts took the opportunity to buy at a cheap price, the noon closing rebounded. In the afternoon, rumors were unfavorable, and profits were returned, and the market returned to a small size. As a result, the SMC still only had 130 yuan and 129 yuan, which was one or two yuan smaller than the previous market. The SMC's Yinghua company loaded 160 yuan, 7 angles, and now 155 yuan, also with a small half yuan to one yuan, and less than 10,000 bags were traded. The SMC's Yinghua company has nearly a thousand tons.

Yesterday, the source of both thick and thin new broken japonica rice became rare, and only a hundred stones of new goods arrived. The sellers' intention to sell was strengthened, and the shouting was particularly strong, and the local stores were also afraid of missing out, and the intention to collect became stronger. Because of this, the price of Kunshan new japonica rice rose by one or two yuan, opening at 155.5 yuan, 155 yuan, Qingyong Kiln variety at 1545 yuan, Xitang Baige at 1534 yuan, and Nanxiang early broken rice had no honor or disgrace due to the similar arrival and sale, and continued to sell at 157 yuan, 156.5 yuan. Xin Dujian is still unmarketable due to the management of the goods. Glutinous rice has not changed much. Hong Kong specially has 151.5 yuan, 152 yuan for ordinary, 150 yuan, and 148 yuan. Glutinous green special 146 yuan to 54 yuan.

Yesterday, a small number of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai again. The Taikoo Company's Yangzhou ship arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, carrying 323 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. It is scheduled to moor at the company's wharf in the French Concession today.

### More Price Decline in Western Powder

Yesterday, the western powder market presented a situation of hesitation. After the market opened in the morning, the market price originally had a tendency to fall because foreign rice returned to decline, and people's hearts were flat and soft. However, the enthusiasm of hoarding households did not decline, and Tianjin merchants and other real sellers also came to the market to ask prices. Therefore, although there were large households taking profits and spitting out with the market, the market price was ultimately unable to be suppressed. American powder merchants saw greed and promised to stand firm, while there were too many arrivals of powder and stocks. In the afternoon, when unfavorable floating accounts returned, the market price had decreased by two or three corners. Jinlong Xizhan opened in the morning at 39.8 yuan and fell to 39.5 yuan in the afternoon. Also, Dongzhan opened in the morning at 40 yuan and 39.67 yuan in the afternoon, two or three corners smaller than the previous closing. American powder bananas were 40 yuan, and Fort opened in the morning at 41 yuan, once reducing by two or three corners. However, with Rong Hu asking prices, the evening closing still had to be 41 yuan and 40 yuan, 9 angles, which was more than one or two corners larger than the previous day. The number of transactions was as high as 89,000. Wheat bran was as beautiful as ever, and small packages officially opened at 42 yuan. Spot wheat is still shouting for the original price, but the stock of goods in the market is still 78,000 bags.

### Piece Goods: Prices Excessively High; Piece Goods, Woolen Cloth, and Flannel; Appetites Are All Dull

Yesterday's market for factory cloth fluctuated, opening slightly firm in the morning and falling back in the afternoon. This was because the actual sales were limited to a corner of the street, and traders and hoarders considered transactions, either advancing or retreating, influencing the market. As a result, the selling price of each cloth varied greatly. Brand-name goods were asked about by hoarders, and the selling price was firm. The miscellaneous brands were affected by the decline in actual sales, and the price fell by five corners to one yuan. Over 700 pieces of various cloths were traded on the street. Some customers from the Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong gangs transferred and sold their stocks, and some chose to buy and hoard at a cheap price.

Eastern cloth rose in the morning and returned in the afternoon, but the situation was still firm. This was because the futures cloth on the exchange had planned to rise by two or three corners per piece in each month of the previous market. In the later market, the opening fell by five or six corners due to the decline in Double Horse yarn. However, by the time of the closing, the people's hearts were good again, and the trend continued to rise. As a result, the market was two corners to three corners lower than the previous day's market. In the spot market, the Dragon Head factory order fell by two corners, and the evening closing was 68.1 yuan, and the Four Gentlemen serge fell by two and a half tenths, and the new order was 1.46 yuan and a half. Middle-grade fine cloth and fine twill are as stable as ever.

Retail sales of woolen cloth and flannel in the store are quite strong, and wholesale transactions have gradually become dull. This is because both woolen cloth and flannel shops and suit shops have considerable stocks. Customers only in Nanjing and Nanyang ports have slightly purchased. The price of goods has risen to the top, and actual sales have gradually decreased. Recently, those who hold the goods have been making excuses for the shrinkage of foreign exchange, and they have been shouting for price increases. Most of the dismantlers have also increased the price of samples. Judging from the recent market trend, it has become a situation of sluggish sales and rising prices.

### Sugar Market: After the Settlement of Sugar Futures, New Trading Began Yesterday

Yesterday, the sugar market futures joint venture announced the settlement price for pre-suspension trading: 192 yuan for October 20 and 195 yuan for October 30. New trading opened in the afternoon. The October 30 contract opened at 203 yuan and closed at 206.7 yuan, with a high of 208.5 yuan and a low of 203 yuan. Off-site trading was 208.8 yuan. The November 10 contract opened at 208 yuan and closed at 209.5 yuan, with a high of the same price and a low of 206 yuan. Off-site trading was 210.3 yuan, indicating that the market is still rising.

### Oil Cakes: Actual Sales of Edible Oil Still Weak

Yesterday's actual sales of edible oil were still sluggish. Speculators were also inactive due to the decline in gold and yarn, so trading was not high. The market was flat at first, but then tended to weaken, and the result was a decline of three to five yuan compared to the previous day. A total of 100 tins of Jiangbei raw oil, 100 dan of Dayou factory refined oil, and 200 dan of rapeseed oil and 30 barrels of Lide factory rapeseed oil were traded.

### Metals: Green Lead and Iron Collected Enthusiastically

The metals market has recently been scarce, because each road is still not moving. Only green lead and iron have been blocked from the source, and the factories on the street have a sudden intention to enter, the people's hearts are inspired, and the market has risen again. Yesterday, such as 200-pound green lead and double-linked iron, each box sold for 770 yuan, and the Huisi goods were temporarily because the spot goods in Shanghai were exhausted, so there was no labor for goods without a market. In addition, such as three-point four-point bamboo steel bars, each ton sold for 3,250 yuan, and five-point to one-inch goods were priced at 3,200 yuan, and each bundle of 2,000-pound black iron billet was sold for 5,500 yuan. Each barrel of Yuan nails from the factory opened at 195 yuan.

### Only Implementing Price Controls Can Suppress Profiteering

Chinese Merchants Raising Prices Arbitrarily Harm Citizens; Unified Control and Licensing of Business May Be Effective

Yesterday, the Shanghai market's U.S. dollar trading saw major foreign banks such as HSBC dumping large quantities, falling to 29 yuan, and the speculative red market gradually declined. The actions that had disrupted the market in the past few days have stopped being active, proving that speculative behavior is a self-generated, self-destructive evil result. Citizens should not overemphasize it and foster the atmosphere, and the legal currency has its certain value, which is even more obvious. However, the general merchants who only care about private rent take advantage of raising prices to harm citizens, which makes the company sigh.

There Is No Reason for Prices to Rise

The North-China Daily News said that the person in charge stated yesterday (the 15th) that there is no reason for the recent soaring prices in the city. If this continues, the cost of living and the rise in prices will not stop until it "bursts." Most warehouses are full of goods, which shows the breadth of hoarding. Some Chinese and newly arrived Europeans in Shanghai are buying as many items as possible, storing them in warehouses, and waiting for a good price to sell. Well-informed sources claim that some people aim to monopolize the entire market for a certain commodity by hoarding. Recently, a certain commodity was sold by a British agency in the city to a Chinese store for a price of 160 yuan, but these stores are selling it for more than 380 yuan, which proves the ruthlessness of illegal profiteers. According to inquiries in the market, the statement that the activities of large importers are related to raising prices is not true.

Profiteering Is Truly Unforgivable

Well-informed sources said that Chinese stores often obtain foreign currency from foreign banks at the official exchange rate and purchase goods from importers, and then sell the combined price at an illegal exchange rate, which is truly intolerable. On the other hand, it is heard that there are also similar extortionate rental agencies in the city, which are operated by some foreigners and make huge profits. Anyone who entrusts them with renting a house must first deposit 100 yuan as a registration fee until they move into the new address, and they are subjected to layers of exploitation. In short, Shanghai is a paradise for unscrupulous merchants. Since there is no legal risk of sanctions, they engage in hoarding as a business, using various excuses and rumors, or trivial accidents, to raise prices, regardless of people's livelihood. It is heard that a certain warehouse in the Public Concession recently reported a loss of caution, and it was found that a large amount of food groceries were stored in the warehouse, with a value of millions of yuan. The purpose of storing it is purely to wait for the price to soar and then sell it late.

Licensed Merchants Should Know Self-Love

A certain foreign merchant suggested that importers in the city could agree not to supply goods unless the stores reduce the price of their goods, in order to counter the crisis of prices here. As long as they persevere, they will be able to make the stores comply. Some people still say that it is easiest for the Shanghai Municipal Council to take measures. Since the Shanghai Municipal Council has business licenses issued to each store, it can implement uniform control measures for licensees. To date, the Bureau has only occasionally prosecuted violators and imposed fines, which has made hoarders even more daring and lawless.

Society Is Intolerable

Also, another record in the North-China Daily News said that people in society are already intolerable of奸商's raising prices and hoarding in large quantities. They unanimously believe that the Concession authorities should severely punish hoarders, ban foreign exchange speculation, and crack down on landlords illegally extracting tenants. In terms of current prices, even the middle class is feeling undernourished, and the proletariat must be reduced to beggars and bandits. Therefore, in winter, Shanghai's security is very worrying. The only hope is that the authorities can order hoarders to sell goods, suppress prices, and increase people's purchasing power.

Buying in Large Quantities Is No Different from Suicide

General opinion: The illegal foreign exchange should not affect people's lives, but it often stimulates the rise in prices and reduces people's purchasing power. Another major cause of social unrest is the high rent. Landlords and second-hand agents add rent at will. Under this special circumstance, although it is not without difficulties to achieve the purpose of correction, it is not necessarily a failure to be brave. At the same time, users of goods should not be induced by the fear of price increases and refuse to store large quantities of goods in unison. Then we will inevitably fall into the merchant's trick. The dollar's rise a few days ago was entirely caused by sugar merchants搜购 foreign exchange. It is said that last Saturday, a certain Dutch ship arrived in Shanghai and transported 90,000 bags of Javanese sugar.

Flour Supply Is Already Improving

The Machine-Made Noodle Industry and Big Cake Manchu Industry Guilds, in view of the rising price of flour, which is affecting the entire people's food, met on the 13th of this month to send representatives to petition the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting that the foreign powder be purchased directly, transported to Shanghai, and sold at a fixed price to benefit the civilians and stabilize the market. The Shanghai Municipal Council has now replied to the above two industries, saying, "The Bureau is paying attention to the matter of raising the price of flour, and now it is determined to do its best to improve the purchase of flour by various merchants selling flour and to suppress the selling price in the market." The two guilds are grateful for the Shanghai Municipal Council's maintenance of commercial hardship. It is also known that the price of flour has gradually softened in the past two days.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Increases Allowances for Employees

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office, the temporary living expenses allowance issued by the Bureau to employees for October has been decided as follows: (A) For Chinese employees who do not hold a license, an allowance of 245% of the first 200 yuan of their monthly salary will be issued, and the rice allowance will be issued as usual. (B) For foreign employees and Chinese employees holding a certificate, an allowance of 245% of the first 500 yuan of their monthly salary will be issued, 20% of the second 500 yuan of their monthly salary will be issued, and 165% of the remaining amount will be issued. In addition, male employees holding a certificate who are married and whose monthly salary is 700 yuan or less can receive an additional living expenses allowance of 10%.

### Prices of Goods

The table below shows the average retail prices from September 16 to October 15. This price list was compiled by the Shanghai Municipal Council Industrial and Social Affairs Office for use in adjusting employee allowances.

### The Coal Ball Evaluation Association Jointly Organized by the Two Concessions Is Established

Yesterday, We Instructed Other Selling Stores To Mark Prices and Quality

According to a Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announcement, "The Coal Ball Evaluation Committee has been established by the Bureau in conjunction with the French Concession Public Works Bureau. The Committee announced yesterday (the 16th) that each retail store selling coal balls should separately mark the price, composition, and quality of each type of coal ball on the market." It is heard that the members of the Committee are all senior employees of the two Concession 常局. The members are well aware of the state of the coal market and the ball-making situation of each coal ball factory. The Committee has been planning for more than a month.

### Japanese Diplomat Praises Soviet Industry

Excellent Tank Equipment, Unparalleled Underground Railroad

The "Zi Lin Bao" reported that Mr. Tanaka, who served as the secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Moscow last year and is currently the Japanese Consul in Shanghai, praised the industrial efforts of the Soviet Union during a meeting with reporters from the Japanese-language "Continental New Daily" yesterday (16th). He stated that the Soviet Union's implementation of the heavy industry five-year plan has raised its

Automobile Production

level to be equivalent to that of the United States. The Soviet people are inherently mechanically inclined. A few years ago, there were very few cars seen on the streets of Moscow, but now it is different. Their number is surprising. When his American Buick car was parked on the side of the road, many pedestrians always gathered around to inspect the car, ask the driver, or even crawl under the car to study its structure, which proves the Soviet people's interest in mechanics. The Soviet tank army is excellent. Some types of tanks, in addition to six machine guns, are also equipped with three small cannons. The armor is thick. The Moscow

Underground Railroad

is among the best underground railroads in the world. The large platform is built 20 feet underground, with three escalators, which are very suitable for the public to take shelter during air raids. Tanaka concluded that the Soviet army will defend Moscow to the death, but will not implement a scorched earth policy, as it would turn the work of the past 15 years into ashes. In terms of discipline and quality, the Soviet army is comparable to the German army.

### Fang Dan Land Tax Case To Be Pronounced Soon

Judgment Drafted, Under Review by Three Foreign Consuls

Regarding the case of Chinese landlord Zhu Ruiching and others suing the Shanghai Municipal Council for collecting Fang Dan land tax, it was previously reported that the Shanghai Consular Court would pronounce the verdict this afternoon. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, Wang Jian, he told a reporter from the "Da Zhong She" yesterday that after seeing the report, he called Mr. Lang, the secretary of the Consular Court. According to Mr. Lang, he replied that he had told the visiting news reporter that the case would be pronounced soon, but he did not mention when the court would be held for pronouncement. It is suspected that it was a miscommunication. It is understood that the judgment is currently being reviewed in detail by the British Consul General George, the US Consul General Lockehead, and the Japanese Consul General Horiuchi Chijo. It can be signed and delivered to the lawyers of both parties within a few days, and there is no need to hold a court session for pronouncement. The verdict of this case has a significant impact on the rights and interests of Chinese landlords holding Fang Dan land.

### Electricity Company Ceases Renting Out Electrical Appliances

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office, the Shanghai Electric Power Company, in order to avoid a sharp increase in electricity consumption due to the increase in rented appliances, has suggested to the Council that it will no longer rent out electrical appliances to users except in replacement situations. The proposal has been discussed by the Power Saving Committee and the Public Utilities Committee, and has been approved by the regular meeting of the Council's Board of Directors.

### Public Buses Adjusted to Conserve Gasoline

After the implementation of gasoline conservation in Shanghai, the British-owned China General Omnibus Company has also found ways to adjust its routes in order to reduce gasoline consumption while maintaining passenger convenience. Currently, many of the double-decker buses on Route 1, which runs between the Bund and Zhaofeng Park, have been changed to terminate at Jing'an Temple, and additional single-decker buses have been dispatched to run between the Bund and Zhaofeng Park.

### Consolidated Tax on Goods Collected Ad Valorem; Preparations for Monopoly System

Shift Tax Focus to Direct Taxes; Collect Land Tax in Kind from Second Half of the Year

In order to adjust wartime tax rates, the Ministry of Finance has considered increasing the tax rates on luxury goods, cigarettes, and alcohol, expanding the scope of the consolidated tax to increase tax revenue. For ten categories, including cigarettes, cured tobacco, foreign wine, beer, beverages, spirits, alcohol, matches, sugar, cement, cotton yarn, and wheat flour, which were previously mostly collected ad valorem, with a portion collected ad valorem or a combination of ad valorem and ad valorem, are now uniformly collected ad valorem. As the prices of the same goods vary from place to place, investigations are being carried out on the prices in various places, valuation agencies are being established, and tax certificates are being revised. The Interim Regulations on the Consolidated Tax on Goods have been promulgated to implement the ad valorem tax in order to adapt to the trend of wartime prices, increase tax revenue, and alleviate wartime expenses.

Pilot Monopoly

In order to regulate social supply and demand and prevent hoarding and speculation, it has been decided to prepare for a goods monopoly system to increase tax revenue and stabilize prices. It has been decided to pilot the system for (1) cigarettes, (2) sugar, (3) matches, (4) alcohol, (5) tea, and (6) table salt to establish a wartime economic policy, implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, and lay the foundation for postwar finance. The National Monopoly Enterprise Setup Committee has been established to conduct research and planning, and will be implemented from January 1 next year.

Establish System

Regarding wartime tax policies, it has been decided to create a direct tax system to shift the focus of taxation from indirect taxes to direct taxes, with income tax, excess profits tax, inheritance tax, and stamp duty as the mainstay. The income tax revenue has increased several times. The excess profits tax has been launched recently and has already achieved results, comparable to the income tax. The inheritance tax has been in operation for just over a year and has been successfully implemented. Stamp duty revenue has also doubled. In terms of current national tax revenue, direct taxes have risen from sixth place before the war to third place.

Collect in Kind

Land tax was originally a national tax. Since the promulgation of the National and Local Tax Revenue Division Standards in the 17th year of the Republic of China, land tax has been under local control. Now, due to the high price of grain and the increasing income from land, it is necessary to reorganize the land tax in order to increase national wealth and benefit the people. In order to adjust national and local revenue and balance the land burden, the land tax of all provinces will be taken over by the central government and reorganized. A Land Tax Reorganization Preparatory Committee has been specially established to manage the land tax in a coordinated manner. From the second half of this year, all provinces will collect land tax in kind.

### Over 10,000 Yuan Raised for Orphanage Education Expenses

The China Children's Relief Association's campaign to raise orphanage education expenses for this year aims to raise over 10,000 yuan. Since it started on October 10th, it has been enthusiastically supported by all sectors and has achieved great success. As of yesterday, over 10,000 yuan in donations has been raised, but it is still far from the target. Work is now being stepped up to actively solicit donations, hoping to reach the predetermined target within the fundraising period.

### Commemorative Stamps Difficult to Purchase

The commemorative stamps for the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China have been selling briskly since their release on National Day. The one-yuan stamps have all been sold out. As for the remaining stamps, such as one-cent, two-cent, four-cent, eight-cent, one-jiao, one-jiao six-fen, two-jiao one-fen, two-jiao eight-fen, three-jiao, etc., a reporter learned that the stamp sales department of the Bureau has been limiting the purchase of the above-mentioned stamps by citizens since yesterday morning. At the same time, it is preparing to issue another batch, but this has yet to be confirmed.

### White Russian Commits Suicide by Poison

At around 9:30 yesterday morning (16th), a White Russian man named Gabosdinah, 32 years old, collapsed in Gujiazhai Park. He was sent to the Russian Hospital, where he died at 11:20. According to the doctor's examination and the diary found beside him, he committed suicide by poisoning.

### Special Property Tax on Charitable Organizations, etc. Can Request Exemption, But Not Based on Economic Conditions

The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a notice yesterday stating that regarding the special property tax on business premises to be levied by the Council starting from January 1 next year, it has been previously announced. Except for those who specifically request exemption, all premises that are not purely used as residences or have not been previously exempted from taxes, such as churches, temples, and hospitals, are required to pay the tax. Requests for exemption from this special tax should be based on the nature of the business, such as charitable organizations, etc., and not on the economic situation of the business. Applications should be submitted to the Deputy Director-General of Finance and Head of the Tax Department of the Council as soon as possible for review.

### Inconvenient Travel on the North Bank of the Suzhou Creek

Recently, the defenses of the Japanese soldiers in the Zhabei area have become increasingly strict, especially at the various openings along the concession. In addition to Xin Zha Bridge, which is still blocked with barbed wire, and guards are frequently stationed at the openings for people to pass through, sandbags have been piled up and wooden frames have been erected at Baoshan Road intersection, Bazi Road Fusheng Road intersection, and Haining Road North Jiangxi Road intersection, and wrapped with barbed wire. The length is five or six zhang, and there are more than a dozen barriers at each opening. Only one person can pass at a time. Vehicles used to be able to pass unimpeded, but now they are all marked with signs prohibiting traffic and must detour through Sichuan Road Bridge. The security is very strict in the evening. Pedestrians must undergo strict inspections, so when pedestrians are crowded, queues of more than ten zhang are often formed.

### Italian Ship "Mabelia" Sailed to Zhejiang, Detained in Huangyan Port

The Italian merchant Vicoji Foreign Company's "Mabelia" ship sailed from Shanghai to Haimen, Zhejiang. After arriving at Jinqing Port, Huangyan County, the local garrison and county government detained the ship because it had entered the Jinqing Port blockade line without prior approval and reported the incident to the Seventh District Commissioner's Office for instructions. It is reported that the foreign company, after receiving the news, has requested the Chinese authorities in the area to release it.

### Major Bloodshed in the French Concession Last Night; Wang Jigao, Assistant Manager of the Bank of China, Abducted and Brutally Murdered En Route

French Detective and Vietnamese Police Officer Killed in a Fierce Fight; One Bandit Killed and One Wounded; Two Chinese Police Officers Also Shot

At around 10 o'clock last night, a major police-bandit battle occurred in the Baisezhong Road area of the French Concession. Three bandits had previously robbed a silver No. 18292 taxi, went to Yinhua Street in the Public Concession, and abducted Wang Jigao, a native of Anhui who was the former manager of the Yangzhou branch of the Bank of China and is now the assistant manager of the head office, and fled towards the western district of the French Concession. En route, the hostage Wang called for help and was shot and killed by the bandits. Nearby police officers, together with the pursuing police, engaged in a fierce fight with the bandits. At that time, a French detective and a Vietnamese police officer were unfortunately shot and killed. One bandit was killed and one was wounded. One bandit was captured. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The detailed account of the incident is as follows:

Stepping Out of a Restaurant, Suddenly Abducted

Wang Jigao, 45, a native of Anhui, is the former manager of the Yangzhou branch of the Bank of China and is currently the assistant manager of the head office. He lives at No. 572 Rue Lafayete. Last night, he accepted an invitation from a friend to dine at the Datong Restaurant on Yinhua Street. After finishing dinner at around 10 o'clock, he stepped out of the restaurant. Before he had taken a few steps, four bandits suddenly rushed out from the side of the road, each with a pistol in their sleeves. They first silenced Wang, and then dragged him into the silver taxi No. 18292, which was parked on the side of the road, and fled towards the French Concession.

Silver Taxi Robbed in Advance

As for the silver taxi, it is said that the bandits had forcibly robbed it in front of the Grand Theater on Jiujiang Road. According to people from the Silver Taxi Company, the company received a call at around 10 o'clock last night, instructing them to send a car to the intersection of Wanjiang Road and Yinhua Street. The company dispatched a car to the address. When the car arrived near the Grand Theater on Jiujiang Road, two men came forward to call the driver and claimed that the car was the one they had hired. At the same time, two other men also got into the car and instructed the driver to drive to Moore Road.

Abduction and Escape, Car Breaks Down

But when the car reached Fuxu Road on Moore Road, the four passengers in the car suddenly showed their ferocious faces, took out guns, forced the driver to take off his uniform and hat, and then drove him out of the car. The bandits then drove the car themselves to the entrance of the Datong Restaurant. After abducting Wang Jigao, they drove towards the French Concession. When they reached the vicinity of No. 1770 Avenue Joffre, the car suddenly broke down and could not move forward. The bandits were panic-stricken and got out of the car one after another, holding the hostage and walking along Avenue Joffre.

Hostage Calls for Help, Shot to Death

When they were walking to Wenlin Road, Wang Jigao saw two Chinese police officers and a Vietnamese police officer passing by, and immediately shouted for help. Unexpectedly, this angered the bandits, who immediately fired three shots at him, killing him on the spot. At the same time, they exchanged fire with the police officers. The gunshots rang out for a while. As a result, Vietnamese police officer No. 845 was shot in a vital spot and died. Two Chinese police officers, No. 69 and No. 5268, were also shot and fell to the ground. The bandits fled west along Baisezhong Road.

Major Police-Bandit War, French Police Officer Killed

When they fled to the intersection of Rue du Pere Huc, the four bandits encountered two French police officers from the French Police Station, No. 04 and No. 501, who were on patrol in a patrol car. The bandits opened fire again, killing French police officer No. 04 with a shot to the head. West Police Officer No. 501 returned fire. At this time, the French Police Station had received the news and dispatched a large team of detectives to rush to the scene and launch a major encirclement and pursuit of the bandits. The fight was fierce for a while, and the gunshots rang out continuously like a string of beads. As a result, one bandit was killed, one bandit was wounded, and one bandit was captured alive. Two Mauser pistols and dozens of rounds of ammunition were seized.

French and Vietnamese Police Officers to Be Buried Today

Western Detective Laotianong of the French Police Station was shot and killed by rioters on the 15th of this month. His funeral is scheduled for the 17th of this month. At 8:45 a.m., the coffin will be placed in the Guangci Hospital.

Vietnamese police officer No. 845, who died in the line of duty at the same time as the Western Detective, will also be placed in the Guangci Hospital and buried in the Lujiawan Cemetery at 3 p.m. on the 17th of this month.

### Enthusiastic Support from All Sectors; Industrial Relief; Puben Society Appeals for Donations

In order to promote and expand industrial relief work, the Puyi Industrial Society has sent a letter to all enthusiastic people, asking them to give assistance with the goal of 50,000 yuan. The original letter is as follows: Since our society launched various relief work, we have been fortunate to receive enthusiastic support from all sectors in the form of donations of cash or clothing, benefiting the old, weak, sick, and poor, and relieving unemployed men and women. In the past three years, the number of poor people who have benefited has been more than ten million. However, as the war zone has not yet recovered its order, the general refugees still need continued relief, and the Westerners who used to maintain the West have withdrawn from Shanghai, so the relief funds are greatly reduced. Moreover, as prices are rising, the livelihood of the poor is increasingly affected, and it is expected that the threat of unemployment will be even greater than in the past. Since our society is entrusted by all sectors, we should work even harder. It is difficult to continue without actively raising funds. Therefore, we sincerely appeal, hoping that we will maintain our enthusiasm for disaster relief, give assistance and solicit donations, so that we will be able to live without worrying about food and clothing, and we will have work to do, so that we can get through these difficult times. Not only will the general refugees suffering from hunger and cold be greatly benefited, but the whole society will also be blessed. After this newspaper appealed to all sectors on behalf of the society, donations have been very enthusiastic. Yesterday, a Mr. Chen generously donated a large sum of 2,000 yuan, designating it to establish an apprentice class to help unemployed youth learn practical crafts. The society's office is located at No. 115 Hankou Road, 2nd Floor (opposite the Zhongnan Bank), telephone 6082. Donation collection points: (1) Shanghai Bank Tongfu Road Branch, (2) Shanghai Bank Yuyuan Road Branch, (3) Shanghai Bank Avenue Joffre Branch.

### Bomb Case on Pope Road; Major Offender Captured

A bomb explosion occurred a few days ago in the pavilion room on the second floor of the Kangzhong Western Paper Store at No. 436 Pope Road. Two residents of the pavilion room, Ye Yichang and Zhang Xingdou, were injured on the spot. The police immediately started investigating and learned that the person who rented the pavilion room was Liu Shihua, a native of Hubei, who had already fled. When Liu rented the house, the sub-landlord Zhou Xincai (54 years old) posted a rental advertisement in the newspaper, and Liu sent a letter to Zhou at No. 5 Eide Lane, Raul Road. He took the letter to Raul Road to meet Liu Shihua and finally rented the house to Liu. The French Police Station immediately followed up on this and sent police officers to No. 5 Eide Lane, Raul Road, and found a lot of explosives in the kitchen and captured Liu Shihua's younger brother, Liu Shicheng. The French Police Station is still conducting a close investigation into the whereabouts of Liu Shihua, who is on the run.

### Bomb Explodes on Railway Near Longhua

The Shanghai-Hangzhou express train, which departed from Hangzhou at around 4 p.m. yesterday, was passing over a certain bridge between Xinlonghua and Xujiahui at 8:30 p.m. when a timed large bomb suddenly exploded near the bridge. At that time, the train had already left a certain bridge and was far away, so the vehicles and passengers were not injured. Several zhang of the railway tracks were destroyed by the explosion. The Japanese side sent personnel to the scene of the accident to investigate and repair the damaged railway tracks.

### Another Japanese Soldier Sniped at the Wharf of the Yangshupu Fish Market

Seriously Wounded, Assassin Escapes; Japanese Side Conducts Strict Investigation Without Results

According to the English-language "Da Mei Evening News," First Class Seaman Potian Yuango of the Japanese Marine Corps was sniped at around 6:20 this morning (16th) while on guard at the wharf in front of the Yangshupu Andong Road Fish Market. According to Japanese official sources, several suspects shot Potian from behind and then fled.

The section of the Huangpu River from near the Fish Market to the Land Road Wharf was also blocked. Japanese Navy patrols searched along the river. Chinese small boats were all ordered to dock for inspection, and no boats were allowed to pass. As a result, the passenger ships of the Marler Company and the Shanghai Electricity Company were blocked. The injured Japanese soldier was sent to the Japanese Marine Corps Hospital. The extent of the soldier's gunshot wounds is still unknown, but it is said that the injuries are serious. At the same time, the Japanese Gendarmerie in Pudong is still conducting a major search near Jujia Bridge in the hope of arresting the murderer who shot Japanese soldier Okamoto on Tuesday night.

### Weather Forecast

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 p.m. yesterday stated that the low-pressure system is passing through Mongolia and moving east.

As for the establishment of schools in counties, townships, and districts with developed education, it is currently planned to designate private primary schools of all levels as substitutes to facilitate implementation. The Administrative Council recently approved the implementation of mandatory enrollment through lottery to enhance the effectiveness of education. The proposed measures are as follows: A. Measures for Mandatory Enrollment of School-Age Children: (1) The heads and deputies of townships and districts will be responsible for investigating eligible children; (2) Township offices and district offices should provide books and stationery to impoverished children who enroll. B. Measures for Mandatory Enrollment of Out-of-School Citizens: (1) Township and district heads should organize out-of-school citizens in their respective areas into classes and designate schools for mandatory enrollment on a regular basis; (2) The books used will be obtained by the county government from the Department of Education and distributed to the schools, while stationery will be the responsibility of the township and district heads to provide.

### Ginling University Establishes a Social Welfare Administration Group

(Chengdu Dispatch) Social welfare is an emerging industry in China. The Ministry of Social Affairs is actively promoting it in conjunction with various parties. Social welfare administration is a newly emerging science in the past decade. It has become very popular in Europe and the United States, but it is still lacking in our country. In order to meet current needs, Ginling University, after consultation with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Affairs, has specially established a Social Welfare Administration Group this autumn. The Ministry of Social Affairs will also assist in hiring Dr. Chen Wenxian, an expert in social welfare administration who studied in the United States, as the director. Students have now been fully enrolled, and classes officially began on the 22nd of last month. Currently, it is experimental in nature, and it is planned to expand it into a department next year, and then expand it into a Social Welfare Administration College to cultivate a large number of social administration talents to meet the needs of the country. The curriculum emphasizes both theory and practice, with the community as a laboratory. In order to enable students to practically engage in social work, it has been decided to set up a social welfare experimental center on Jiangxi Street in Chengdu, so as to achieve the effect of theory and practice complementing each other.

Spring and Autumn

### Eradicating Beggars from the Streets

— Mu Chang

As the weather turns cold, the emaciated beggars on the streets must fight not only hunger but also the pain of the cold. Before the war, a beggar could survive a few winters with some makeshift methods, but now, it is a small miracle to be able to huddle and wait for the warmth of the spring sun under the meager food thrown their way. Even at this time, charitable organizations are busy providing porridge and clothing.

It is true that in such difficult times, those with a charitable heart have not forgotten their heavenly duty, but seeing piles of starving beggars lying by the roadside, their breath as faint as a thread in the wind and rain, the citizens cannot help but feel a chill.

Since so many are dying of cold and starvation, making burial difficult, the number of beggars on the streets is increasing. It is truly difficult to understand why they are born and where they are going to die. Some are undoubtedly degraded due to bad habits, but most are forced out of employment due to the recent tightening of the structure of normal industries. Even being a porter is extremely difficult with a small piece of cake costing one dime. Passersby have to calculate fares when taking a bus, but it is not easy to relieve hunger with just one or two dimes for begging. So another path is: snatch! They dare not snatch big things, but even medicine must be taken opportunistically. This is also something that chills the citizens.

Recently, the ban on the export of goods has severely affected the industrial workers in that sector and the dockworkers. They are bound to resort to begging as a last resort. Although beggars are suffering from cold and starvation, a continuous stream of those waiting to die will swarm in. In view of this, the authorities of the two concessions recently planned to build large-scale beggar residences to solve the above problem, which is very meaningful. It is said that in addition to providing care, they will focus on education and teaching them how to make a living, which is more proactive.

In addition, it is also hoped that the general living conditions of the citizens will be greatly improved, and that all speculation and hoarding will be strictly prohibited - as the recent prices of daily necessities have been too threatening to the citizens and may cause everyone to suffer from cold and starvation. If there is such a determination to ban these activities, it will also be the best way to actively prevent the increase of beggars, which is of great importance to social order.

In the Circle of Life

### Cracking Jokes and Talking Nonsense: The Lively Elements of the Market

— Pingfan

Those who rely on a limited fixed salary and whose bodies are like shop assistants in a cage cannot help but admire my bowl of rice – the broker. Indeed, in the past few years, brokers seem to have had good luck! Due to the sharp rise in prices and the frequency of buying and selling in the market, in addition to the wealthy bosses who hoard goods and become bloated, the brokers are the ones who naturally benefit.

Brokers were originally legitimate intermediaries in commerce, but now they have changed their nature and become helpers of hoarding and speculation. The objects of buying and selling used to be merchants, but now they have become wealthy wives, old connections, and general bureaucrats and politicians. Among these people, some are completely ignorant of the quality of goods and the market situation. Therefore, they have to rely on brokers for buying and selling.

When brokers encounter this type of client, they are truly shining bright, seeing a way to make money. They use their glib tongues to create a rosy picture, saying that the situation in the Pacific is tense, shipping is interrupted, and the source is about to be cut off; that there was a poor harvest this year; or that it is raw material for military supplies and Country X will ban exports. These clients, whose original purpose is to get rich, naturally have their hearts fluttered when they hear these very reasonable explanations.

"Then help me buy some."

With a pat on the chest, they say: "I guarantee you'll make money!" The business is a success. The commission is in hand, and they don't care about profit or loss. Fortunately, in this day and age, profits are more likely than losses. After buying in, they naturally have to sell out, and they have to rely on you again. This way, whether they profit or lose, both commissions are indispensable. If you encounter an idiot, you can also put on some "hats" (that is, secretly increase the price), which is even more of a "profit without capital."

Cracking jokes, recognizing people, and being diligent are all the only capital for being a broker. Without these, you can forget about earning even a dime.

For example, if you find out that Boss Wang has a batch of rayon, which is in demand in the market, you have to use some tricks and come up with some good ideas to get it out of his hands.

"Boss Wang, the rayon from a certain company on the market is very similar in price. Are you interested?" This is a reverse strategy. See if he is interested or not, and then turn the topic around:

"Do you also have this kind of goods? Then, according to this market situation, are you willing to sell them?" With this kind of joke, at least he won't be too speculative.

Some of the clients who are complete novices have money, rely on being deceived, and smoke opium. Brokers have to visit them every day to do their business. In addition to business, they can talk about anything from international events to ballads. In short, if they get along well, they can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

This is how brokers deceive people every day. Of course, it is not surprising to earn hundreds of times a day, but sometimes, after running around for months in the rain and sun, they cannot earn a penny, which is not surprising either.

Although the trend of hoarding and speculation cannot be said to have been created by brokers, it is undeniable that brokers have helped fuel more waves in this regard and done some bad work.

### Street Inspection

— Jichen

The snatching wind on the street has become more and more rampant recently. A woman who looked like a maid had just left a pharmacy, and the medicine in her hand was also coveted by this group of "reaching generals." It was reasonable for the woman to shout for the prescription back.

Local Scenery

### The Outer Garments of Avenue Joffre

— Fang Qiang

Autumn has brought a melancholy atmosphere.

The gray sand on the road, mixed with leaves, is fluttering and dancing everywhere. People's clothing has naturally added "cold protection" - especially the short coats of women, which are the most obvious mark: white serge, various colors of wool, and velvet, all moved from boxes or store windows to the "jade body."

But the most obvious expression can be seen on Avenue Joffre - from the living people on their bodies to the dead ones dressed in shop windows.

Avenue Joffre has wind, but no sandstorms. It is not as crowded as Nanjing Road, but it has the footprints of couples, and the tranquility and leisure of a bustling city street are its characteristics.

The "cafes" and "bars" with Southern European flavor are the best embellishments. The ladies who enter and exit these places are either friends with leisure or couples. Let coffee and whiskey stimulate the nerves and find a little excitement that has already been decadent. The jazz music that leaks out will attract some people, but others will run farther away.

And autumn makes them feel something, because the arrival of winter is another serious threat to life.

The walls of the "bars" and "cafes" are changing from light to dark colors with the cooling weather, which is indeed a serious warning to those standing on street corners. However, distant warnings cannot turn into "panaceas."

Here, please go east. Clothing stores and shoe stores will unfold before your eyes.

Wool stores have replaced fat serge with new-style "imported goods" such as "Hailimeng," with suits ranging from 200 to 500 or 600. It is strange to say that as long as the "patterns are new," the sales are said to be no problem. Although people are starving to death every day, there are still many "rich people."

However, the business of old suit stores is always better than that of new clothing stores. But now, there are fewer customers shopping for banana clothing than before.

There is also a contrast on Avenue Joffre, with one side replacing the "autumn clothes" for the shop windows, and the other side discounting and "selling out" summer clothes, shoes, and daily necessities.

So, in each shop window, there began a "clearance of inventory" and turmoil.

### Beggar Market

— Dafen

Now is the time (Impression of the Petrol Panic) Yangzijiang to (illegible) Yue Shuaiyang

It is reported that the municipal authorities of this port, the Salvation Army, and the Rotary Club have met to build a "beggar market" to teach beggars skills and provide education to beggar children. This is indeed a wise and far-sighted plan. We hope that people from all walks of life can support and cooperate to promote its early realization.

We know that some of today's beggars and beggar children not only beg on the streets, but also rob and seize by force. The number of women and children who have been harmed by them is truly unknown. And passers-by are mostly accustomed to it, without sympathy, without assistance, chuckling, watching them go away.

But now they rob miscellaneous items on the street. Who knows if they will not become kidnappers and giant social worms in the future? Today's society condones their future, and they repay society with greater harm. This is the retribution suffered by a society that is a little irresponsible.

At present, the most important issue is beggar children. Due to war and other reasons, the number of beggars in this port has been increasing day by day in recent years. Due to the influence of the environment, many of them are doing evil. People give them a special title, which is "little scoundrel." In addition, there is no further questioning. Let them soak and bubble in the dye vat of sin.

They are indeed incorrigible if they continue to live like this. Because their environment only allows them a future of wrongdoing. They will not have any ambition, and they will have no way to make progress at all. But if they can have a chance to renew themselves, a better environment, they can become good and can make progress. And it is the responsibility of this society to turn this group of people who are about to embark on the road of sin into law-abiding citizens. The establishment of a beggar market is a way to solve this problem, we believe.

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

13.  Wandering to Shanghai

The moment Mei mentioned Shanghai, Autumn Begonia remembered it himself. He recalled more than ten years ago when he went to Shanghai to perform, coinciding with a war. People from Nanjing, Suzhou, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou all fled to the concessions in Shanghai. The theaters not only didn't stop performing, but business was several times better than usual. He personally saw two Western-dressed gentlemen earnestly pleading with a ticket seller because they couldn't get seats.

"Shanghai... yes, Shanghai is truly a good place!" he said in a low voice. "The road is a bit far, but that doesn't matter. I... I've been there twice, and I still remember the way. It's just that for... a young girl like you, it's really too dangerous...!" However, despite his words, he had a sense of the urgency and importance of the matter. Even though Shanghai was a pit of despair, it was still better than staying in his hometown and being ravaged alive.

Thus, the plan to escape was decided. Mei Bao went to the Meng's house again to ask, and coincidentally, Lin Sheng and his wife were also planning to take the same route—the Meng's young shopkeeper's maiden family was in Nanjing... After several hours of discussion, everyone reluctantly bid farewell to old man Meng and Little Dog the next morning, and together with the group unwilling to be slaves, they began to wander like crows who had lost their nests.

### Hoping for the Friends of "Shanghai Professional"

— Jiang Qi

The news of the establishment of the Shanghai Professional Theatre Troupe has elicited various opinions from friends. Some say that the isolated island now has an additional force for promoting the theater movement, while others say that it will invisibly weaken the strength of other friendly forces. This is naturally a case of "the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom."

However, it seems too early to make a judgment on the Shanghai Professional Theatre Troupe at its inception. The troupe's future movements and prospects are what deserve our deep concern. The author has boundless hopes for the friends of "Shanghai Professional," and dares to offer some humble opinions here:

First, the Shanghai theater scene in the past was very scattered. It is hoped that the formal establishment of "Shanghai Professional" and the efforts of its friends can quickly promote the unity of the Shanghai theater scene. Make every theater troupe, every actor, unify factions, overcome prejudices, and sincerely join hands to systematically exert collective strength, and to consolidate and expand the mission of the Shanghai theater scene in this time and place.

Second, it is hoped that "Shanghai Professional" can quickly cultivate a large number of excellent new cadres, thereby abolishing the "star system." Then "Shanghai Professional" will leave a glorious page in the history of Chinese theater. Even if it takes a step back, to ensure that the tragedy of "one hair triggers the whole body" does not repeat itself, the achievements of "Shanghai Professional" will not be erased.

Third, it is hoped that "Shanghai Professional" can strive to improve the technical standards of stage art. The friends of "Shanghai Professional" all have a deep understanding of theater and outstanding achievements. I believe that they will pay special attention to this point. What I want to particularly emphasize is that the improvement of technical standards is not about the doctrine of "art for art's sake." It is mainly to make the weapon of theater play its greatest function in this era.

Finally, I respectfully hope that the friends of "Shanghai Professional" will strive to fight in this great era, understand the great era, perform the great era, and stand at the forefront of the great era to serve the great era!

### The Stalwarts of the Storytelling Theaters in Autumn (Part Two)

— Jian Fanbu

Ling Wenjun: A junior storyteller. Since her debut, she has been affiliated with radio broadcasts. Having less experience on the stage, there were very few good materials. Unexpectedly, Ling Wenjun, who just came to Shanghai from Wumen, whether it is speaking, humor, playing, singing, or starting roles, is seamlessly precise and follows the rules. Wenjun is a disciple of Zhu Qinxiang, and is good at telling "Gold-painted Phoenix" and "Double Gold Ingots." Her teacher had no well-known reputation at first. I listened to Wenjun telling "Double Gold Ingots," "Riot at the Court," and "Visiting Prison" several times in Lake Garden. She vividly describes the characters in the story, and her imitation of various singing styles is almost indistinguishable from the real thing. Her singing voice is clear and melodious, so she has the reputation of "Little Iron Voice of Jiangnan," and is indeed an outstanding talent among the junior storytellers.

Wang Baoliang: The blind man Wang Baoliang is currently affiliated with the South Garden Night Theater, telling "Ten Thousand Years Green" (i.e., Qianlong's Journey to the South). He is full of energy, spirit, and god. His storytelling is clear, and his description of the darkness in the Qing court is subtle and thorough. He is a rare stalwart among the storytellers.

Shen Huitang: The storyteller Shen Huitang's "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" has long been famous. However, in the past, he was only affiliated with radio broadcasts, and we could only hear him talk on the radio, which was not enough. Now, he is affiliated with the Huiquan Lou Day Theater, where we can see his storytelling in person. It is elegant and natural, and his words are brilliant. He can be compared with Guo Shaomei, who has been doing this for many years. It is a pity that his bass is too weak, which is the same problem as Xu Jixiang. It is a pity.

Wu Zian: A junior storyteller. Because he has less experience in storytelling, finding a good material is even rarer than a phoenix feather or a unicorn horn. Wu Zian is the son of the senior storyteller Wu Junan. His telling of "Sui and Tang Dynasties" is extremely skilled and flawless. He is currently affiliated with Lake Garden, Zhang Garden, Da Luotian, and other storytelling theaters, and his reputation is very good.

Zhong Ziliang: Zhong Ziliang is the son of Zhong Shiliang. He has a family background, and his voice is full of spirit. He tells "The Story of Yue Fei," fighting the enemy as if he were there. He is currently affiliated with the East Garden and South Garden, and is also a storytelling stalwart.

Brief News: Mr. Ni Chengbo works at the Standard Chartered Bank and is a rising star in the world of amateur opera performers. He has both a charming appearance and a clear and sweet voice. He is scheduled to perform "Yutangchun" at the Wanhu Society on Sunday this week, with Zhao Shiwei as Wang Jinlong, Shi Chushen as the blue-robed official, and Sha Yihua as the red-robed official. They are all young talents from the business community. The musicians Tang Zaizhe and Gan Ximo are still young people studying. Except for the drummer, all the participants are classmates, and they are all amateur performers, which is quite unique. It is expected to be a great success. (Magpie Tail)

Chapter 18: Vowing to Wipe Out the Huns, Regardless of One's Own Life

Li Zicheng summoned Liu Zongmin again to discuss military matters. He ordered Liu Zongmin to lead the left wing and Li Yan to lead the right wing, each with 50,000 troops, and he himself would lead 150,000 as the central army, following up as reinforcements. Together, they would attack Shanhaiguan, determined to capture Wu Sangui. Liu and Li retreated after receiving the order, inspected their troops, and set off on the appointed day. Liu Zongmin was one of Li Zicheng's most valiant generals. He was originally a blacksmith in Lantian. He was strong, fierce, and unparalleled. He killed his wife and joined Zicheng's uprising. After One-Eyed Tiger was assassinated by Consort Fei, Liu Zongmin was considered the best under Li Chuang. The three armies marched mightily towards Shanhaiguan. At this time, Ma Bao's army was still in Ningyuan. Considering that they were outnumbered, he sent an urgent messenger to Wu Sangui for instructions. Wu Sangui ordered the entire army to retreat to Shanhaiguan, and then, when Li Chuang's troops arrived, to use the terrain to launch a surprise attack. Because the rebel bandits were strong, resisting with a lone army would inevitably be disadvantageous. After receiving the order, Ma Bao ordered his troops to leave empty camps and retreat secretly. When this order was conveyed, it angered Zhang Cangqiu early on. At this time, Xu Jing and Liu Yin were already with the right army, and Bai Xianzong retreated back to the pass. Only Chen Fei was still with Zhang Cangqiu in front of the army. Zhang Cangqiu fully expected Wu Sangui to denounce the rebels and fight them in a bloody battle. Who knew that upon hearing that the rebel bandits' vanguard was approaching, Wu Sangui suddenly ordered a retreat? His mood was suddenly extremely angry again, and he said to Chen Fei, stomping his feet, "Isn't General Wu going to attack the rebels? Why is he retreating when the rebels are coming?" Chen Fei also said, "I really don't understand why General Wu doesn't order a fierce attack? It's like a silver-plated wax spearhead, which is infuriating." Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei immediately ran to Ma Bao's tent to inquire about the truth. (194)
