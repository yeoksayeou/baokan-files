### American Independence Day: Roosevelt Broadcasts to the Nation: The Hard-Won Liberation is Facing Disaster, Urging the People to Prepare for Sacrifice to Uphold Freedom

United Press, Hyde Park, 5th: President Roosevelt warned the American people yesterday, saying, "America cannot stand alone as a happy and prosperous free prairie in the desert of dictatorship for long." He also called upon the people to resist attempts to divide their morale and unity. In order to protect this "free prairie" and ensure freedom of the seas, America is now engaged in "a serious, great, and united endeavor." However, he stated that unity alone is not enough, and America now needs "swift and effective hard work." The President made these remarks in a nationwide broadcast on Independence Day. He said, "When we solemnly reaffirm the great oath to our country and our flag, we should deeply believe that in addition to the oath, we must contribute our labor, our will, and, when necessary, our lives." Roosevelt stated that in the current crisis, Americans have the same responsibilities as Americans in 1776. In 1776, we fought for the great ideal that "government should derive its power from the consent of the governed, securing... freedom." In the century and a half since then, this spirit of human liberty has prevailed throughout the world. However, in our time, this ideal has been opposed by a new resistance arising from new tyrannical regimes in recent years. The fundamental spirit of 1776 is being attacked overseas and threatened at home. Any American who believes that tyrannical rule can conquer human liberty elsewhere but allow liberty to remain intact in America alone is living in a fantasy. Such a view is a naive illusion and an inappropriate belief that leads to the downfall of nations. If Americans wave the flag and reaffirm their belief in freedom but stop there, they are being too simplistic. Those of us who stay awake at night and carefully analyze world affairs should know that we cannot protect freedom today with swords and guns alone. We also know that we cannot protect freedom within our own borders when our neighbors on the left and right lose their freedom. This is why we are currently engaged in a serious, great, and united endeavor to defend the freedom of this globe and the oceans. We not only need unity but also speed and effective work and will stop espionage activities that penetrate our country and bomb our armories."

International News Service, Hyde Park, 5th: President Roosevelt delivered a nationwide broadcast speech of only 447 words on Independence Day yesterday, but it was filled with sharp words, making the people deeply aware that the freedom and liberation that were hard-won in 1776 are now facing disaster.

### Independence Day Ceremony is Solemn: American People Pledge Allegiance

Reuters, New York, 5th: As America faces many troubles abroad and actively strengthens its military at home, it commemorated Independence Day yesterday with unprecedented solemnity. After President Roosevelt announced that the American people must sacrifice their lives if necessary to uphold freedom, the people pledged allegiance to the flag. The President spoke from Hyde Park with a very solemn tone. After the President's speech, Attorney General Stone followed, leading the national audience in pledging allegiance to the flag. The Civil Defense Administration had made arrangements in advance to have Americans everywhere temporarily stop working in order to participate in the celebration ceremony. Therefore, at that time, car drivers stopped on the road, and soldiers stood at attention in the camps, all listening silently to the radio broadcast. Under Stone's guidance, they all pledged allegiance to the American flag and the republic it represents. In some places, it was raining, and fireworks could not be set off. However, in other places, people were excited and eagerly set off fireworks, as fireworks must be manufactured again when world peace is restored according to national defense procedures. Therefore, this fireworks display was the most grand in many years. Americans were greatly moved by the news that Independence Day was also being celebrated enthusiastically in the United Kingdom. On this day, traffic accidents still occurred everywhere in the United States as in previous years. In the first few hours, it was reported that twenty-two people had died as a result.

United Press, Washington, 5th: Supreme Court Justice Jackson urged Americans yesterday to reaffirm their belief in democratic government in order to defeat the "malicious policy of conquering others" by dictatorial countries. Jackson said in a National Day speech that the "Declaration of Independence" gave hope to the enslaved people of the world. He also stated that conquered countries drew inspiration from national rights to resist, change, or abolish existing governments that destroy life, liberty, and happiness.

### American Beliefs and Nazi Ideologies: The Two Cannot Coexist in the World

Reuters, Manila, 5th: U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre delivered a speech yesterday during the celebration of July 4th, saying that the seriousness of the situation in 1941 cannot be compared with that of 1776, because in the past it was only a question of the freedom of a few colonies, while today it is a question of the rights of all mankind. We can close our ears and eyes and not ask about the affairs of other countries, but we will not be able to escape its influence in the end. No country can undermine the orderly procedures of international law without harming the people of other countries, as evidenced by Japan's actions in Northeast China and Italy's actions in Abyssinia. The emergence of Nazi philosophy proves the legitimacy of naked force and rule, so Nazi laws are the laws of the strong, disregarding humanity and only considering national power. The world, though large, cannot allow Nazi ideology and American beliefs to coexist in the world. One of the two must go. We pray to God that this is not about America going to war, but if it is, then we call upon God to help us, for we have no other choice. Britain is currently fighting with its back against the wall for what we depend on for survival. Without American aid, it will surely fail, and Britain's failure will leave the Americas alone to face both Europe and Asia.

### Burmese Defense: Actively Enhanced

Reuters, Rangoon, 5th: Lieutenant General MacLeod, the commanding officer in Burma, said in a broadcast speech last night that Burma and parts of the Far East are establishing air bases so that the commander-in-chief can use the strength of the British Air Force in the most appropriate locations. Burma is currently building minesweepers and patrol boats, and modern mechanized tanks and other equipment are now arriving in a steady stream. The army has also been greatly expanded. A large number of troops, military supplies, and mechanized equipment have been arriving in Burma for some time, and the establishment of Burmese defenses is to fulfill its mission in the overall plan for imperial defense. Burma has added many airfields to prepare for the increased defensive squadrons to go to Malaya and India.

Editorial

### On Red Army Strategy

Two weeks after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the German army has made some local progress on the long 1,500-mile front. From the Baltic coast in the north to the Dniester River basin in the south, the German army is almost all-out, but the Red Army's strong resistance is not entirely disappointing. As of now, although the Nazi army has gained some strongholds after paying a heavy price, it has failed to fully exert its so-called "blitzkrieg" capabilities. In fact, it has not yet caused any decisive effect on the overall war situation; because the Soviet authorities have declared their determination to fight a protracted war, the world is even more concerned about the German army's deep penetration. The Soviet Union is not comparable to France, which every commentator has seen. With the battle line stretched so long, Stalin's declared scorched-earth policy and guerrilla warfare are the "traditional masterpiece" of the Russians. Unless the entire Soviet Union can be crushed like Poland or France in eight weeks, then anyone with a little common sense cannot help but "worry" for Germany—worry that it will eventually repeat the mistakes of Napoleon in the past.

Reviewing the German army's achievements in the past two weeks, the ones that are more worthy of attention can be divided into three routes: (1) In the Baltic region, it has occupied the entire territory of Lithuania and half of Latvia, and will now try to invade Estonia, in order to meet with the German army descending from the Karelian Isthmus in Finland to attack Leningrad; (2) In the Belarusian Union, the German army has crossed Minsk, and according to Berlin propaganda, it has even crossed the Berezina River and is directly attacking Smolensk. This route is the most deeply penetrating branch of the German army and also the most important offensive, with the aim of directly attacking Moscow; (3) In western Ukraine, after occupying Lviv, Lutsk, Dubno and other places, the German army is now attacking Zhytomyr, with the aim of seizing the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, so that it can echo the military actions from Romania attacking Odessa in the future.

From the above, it can be seen that what should be paid the most attention to at present is the central line of the Berezina River battle; assuming that Smolensk is lost, Moscow will naturally feel a direct threat. At that time, in order to stabilize the central government and continue the war of resistance, the Soviet authorities may have to move the capital to the interior. Regarding this, one theory is that it should be moved to Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains, and another theory is that it should even be moved to Omsk in the Irtysh River basin in Siberia. In any case, based on China's combat experience and achievements, as long as the Soviet nation is united and hates the enemy, even if the capital is moved inland and the war zone is expanded, it will not only not harm the final victory in the entire war of resistance process, but also be a most effective and wise strategy for dealing with enemies who are good at quick battles and quick decisions.

Soviet leader Stalin has clearly understood the importance of this strategy, so in his broadcast speech to the nation on the 3rd of this month, he announced the adoption of this strategy to the whole country in the clearest tone and the most resolute language. He first acknowledged that the German army had gained a short-term advantage, saying, "The fall of a part of Soviet territory is due to the fact that the situation at the beginning of the war was favorable to the German army and unfavorable to the Soviet Union," because one side was at war and had already heavily concentrated its forces to launch an offensive, while the other side was hastily responding to the war and was still waiting to be mobilized, so it could not avoid suffering some losses first; however, he believed that this was of no major importance. He encouraged the people of the whole country to concentrate their efforts to fight for freedom and for the motherland. He was confident that "final victory will belong to the Soviet Union," which echoes the Chinese nation's confidence that the war of resistance will surely be won. Not only that, Stalin also instructed the people to implement a scorched-earth policy, saying, "When the Red Army has to withdraw, all vehicles must be withdrawn completely, and not even a train, a pound of grain, or a gallon of gasoline must be left for the enemy to use. The livestock and food of the farms should be handed over to the authorities to be transported to the rear, and anything that cannot be moved should be destroyed." This method of clearing the fields is the most effective way to defeat enemies who are deeply penetrated and aim to plunder resources. If the Red Army authorities can make good use of this strategy in the future, persisting without giving up, so that another long-term war of attrition comparable to China's can be launched in the vast Soviet territory to tie down Hitler's mechanized forces, then it is firmly believed that once winter arrives, these so-called "fast-moving divisions" will all fall into the "snowdrifts" and be unable to move.

### The Purpose of Japan's Establishment of a "Safe Zone" is Actually to Blockade Shipping to the Soviet Union: The U.S. Believes it Conflicts with the Policy of Maintaining Freedom of the High Seas and will Cause an Emergency Situation between the U.S. and Japan; Britain Believes that Japan will Advance South or Even Occupy Vietnam

United Press, Washington, 5th: Since Tokyo announced that Japan is considering establishing a "safe zone" in the Northwest Pacific, diplomatic circles here commented yesterday that Japan is actually trying to establish a de facto blockade, prohibiting merchant ships from transporting supplies from Vladivostok to the Soviet Union. This de facto blockade will directly conflict with the U.S. policy of maintaining freedom of the high seas and will cause a serious state of tension between the U.S. and Japan. According to well-informed sources here, the Japanese claim that the establishment of the safe zone is the same as the safe zone near the Western Hemisphere is inaccurate, because the Japanese safe zone is intended to prevent all merchant ships from transporting supplies to the Soviet Union, while the American safe zone is intended to facilitate normal merchant shipping. The American safe zone does not stop any merchant ships, and American patrols do not prevent warships of belligerent countries from traveling freely, but only prevent warships of belligerent countries from engaging in "combat activities" within the zone. Therefore, the meaning of the safe zone is to prevent warships from taking warlike actions and to prevent them from hindering merchant shipping within the zone. Authoritative sources believe that if the Japanese think of using the American safe zone as a precedent to achieve their goal of restricting cargo ships in the waters near Japan, they will once again distort the American doctrine. Officials recall that the Japanese have also distorted the American doctrine in the past in an attempt to equate their ambition to achieve hegemony in East Asia with America's Monroe Doctrine. At that time, American officials repeatedly pointed out that the Monroe Doctrine was intended to prevent foreigners from further implementing colonial policies in the Western Hemisphere and to prevent foreigners from engaging in political activities in the New World. Officials also said that, furthermore, America's "safe zone" is recognized by twenty-one independent republics and is not a suggestion made by Japan at will in the Western Pacific.

International News Service, Washington, 5th: After studying the situation in the Far East, some American diplomatic observers expressed pessimism about the chances of U.S.-Japan rapprochement. Although Under Secretary of State Welles hopes that Japan's sudden change in its foreign policy may maintain peace in the Pacific, officials here fear that Japan's war machine will eventually move to the Soviet Siberian coastal provinces. Because Japan continues to conduct business negotiations with the Dutch East Indies, some observers believe that Japan does not have any signs of advancing south for the time being. However, some people believe that Japan's new movement of territorial expansion is brewing. Qualified observers here believe that this action of Japan is an attack on Siberia. It is pointed out that if this move succeeds, Japan can remove the military threat from the north and approach new resources.

United Press, London, 5th: Officials and non-officials gradually believed yesterday that Japan is about to abandon its publicly announced policy of not getting involved in the vortex of war, re-adopting a policy of advancing south, and believe that in possible actions, Japan may even occupy French Indochina. Many believe that Japan may attempt to obtain a naval base in Cam Ranh Bay, because in this part of the world, that place is the best natural harbor. Many also believe that Japan will also extend its air force to the south of Indochina.

International News Service, Tokyo, 5th: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka and Army Minister Lieutenant General Tojo yesterday visited the Japanese Emperor to report on "matters under direct jurisdiction." Observers believe that the Foreign Minister and the Army Minister's visit to the Japanese Emperor may have discussed the military aspects of Japan's new policy.

### The Strength of the Far Eastern Red Army Has Not Diminished: Ota's Remarks upon Arriving in Tokyo

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th: Ota, the Japanese acting consul-general in Vladivostok, returned here today. According to him, the Soviet Union's military strength in the Far East has not been affected by the German-Soviet war. The German consulate-general in Vladivostok has ceased all contact with the outside world since June 23. Newspapers and radio stations publish very little war news and are full of heroic deeds of the Red Army. When asked about the US aid to the Soviet Union, Ota replied that ships loaded with food and machines from America arrived in Vladivostok before the war, but have not been seen since the war began.

### Exchange of Notes for the Thai-Vietnam Treaty Takes Place the Day Before Yesterday: Thailand to Receive Ceded Land on August 1st

United Press, Tokyo, 5th: The Cabinet Information Bureau announced today that the ratification of the Thai-Vietnam Peace Treaty has been exchanged by the representatives of the two countries, and the treaty will take effect immediately. The ratification of the draft guarantees and the political understanding between Japan and Vietnam and between Japan and Thailand has also been exchanged. The Japanese representative and the French representative also exchanged the Japanese-Vietnam Navigation Treaty, the Japanese-French agreement on Japanese-Vietnamese tariff commerce, and the ratification of the method of saving money. The above-mentioned ratifications were all exchanged at the official meeting held yesterday. The Information Bureau also said that the draft on the organization and work of the boundary commission and the draft on the implementation of the regulations on the demilitarized zone related to (the middle of the peace) have also been exchanged and ratified. The Japanese Emperor allowed the Japanese government to sign this draft yesterday. According to the demarcation agreement, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam will each send nine members of the commission and five assistant members to define the boundaries on land and rivers in the area, then mark them and draw them into maps. This mixed commission will be chaired by one Japanese representative, and the expenses will be borne equally by the Thai and French governments. It is said that the Thai government will provide all necessary facilities to enable the commission to carry out its duties.

United Press, Bangkok, 5th: News here today said that the land ceded by Vietnam to Thailand will fly the Thai flag after August 1. At the same time, reliable sources said that Thailand has sent a committee to receive the land ceded by Vietnam. Thai police will enter the ceded land on July 26, and the Thai army will not be able to fully occupy the ceded area until mid-August.

### Ayasawa Returns Home, Talks about Japanese-Dutch Relations

Reuters, Taipei, Taiwan, 5th: Ayasawa, the Japanese chief representative at the recent economic conference between Japan and the Dutch East Indies in Batavia, said yesterday upon arriving here that the Dutch East Indies authorities sincerely wished to improve relations with Japan. Although both sides made six months of efforts, it was a pity that they failed to conclude a written agreement. However, in the final decision-making meeting with the Dutch East Indies leader Staes, a certain degree of understanding was obtained. Since then, the attitude of the Dutch East Indies authorities has greatly changed. Their understanding of Japan has become deeper. The advice of Japanese Consul General Ishizawa to the Japanese expatriates in the Dutch East Indies to remain calm, exercise self-restraint, and continue to do business as usual has greatly brightened the atmosphere. The members of the Japanese delegation stayed here for one night and then boarded the original ship this afternoon and set sail for Kobe, where they are expected to arrive on July 8.

### U.S. Army Greatly Expanded: Preparing to Enter the Battlefield; Two Elite Divisions Receive Landing Training; Special Forces for Mountain Warfare are Being Organized; Marshall Says the Air Force has also Increased Fivefold

Reuters, New York, 5th: U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall said yesterday that overseas troops have increased from 45,300 to 116,700, an increase of more than double. This is part of the effort to keep U.S. defenses constantly ready, and the air force teams on the U.S. mainland and overseas bases have also increased fivefold. Two elite divisions with the latest military equipment, which is beyond any other equipment, have been trained with the Navy and Marine Corps in landing operations as required by the expeditionary force. At the same time, a special force division for mountain warfare is being studied and organized. The U.S. Army has expanded from 174,000 to 1,400,000 in the past two years. When training this huge new army, our goal is to make this team ready to enter the battlefield and exert its combat power as time goes on. Marshall has now completed a report and submitted it to Secretary of War Stimson, having served as Army Chief of Staff for two years.

Haitong News Agency, New York, 5th: General Marshall, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, has requested that U.S. troops be deployed to various overseas countries. Officials have not yet approved it. President Roosevelt is unwilling to state his position on this move. Secretary of War Stimson is unwilling to make any statements to the newspapers. A Washington correspondent for the New York Tribune said that Marshall's request is not surprising to those who support the government. They said that this move is just one link in the government's plan to give the President and the Department of the Army the freedom to deploy troops. People on this side believe that the government must immediately ask Congress to formally declare a state of emergency in order to reduce the existing confusion. Opposition members are very frank in their criticism of Marshall's request. Taft said that U.S. troops should not go beyond the Western Hemisphere until the Senate declares war.

### The United States Has Decided to Retrain the National Guard

United Press, Washington, 5th: Major General Wicom, Director of the National Guard Bureau, announced yesterday that 287,700 National Guard officers have expressed their loyalty to continue to serve during this extraordinary emergency. He firmly believes that the opposition of some people to the Congressional decision that National Guard training must be for more than one year is because they are not familiar with the procedures and grades of the National Guard. The current administrative leaders have decided to retrain the National Guard, considering the importance of national defense.

### U.S. Patrols Detain Japanese Ships: Must Unload Cargo Before Being Allowed to Leave the Philippines

United Press, Manila, 5th: Customs tax officer Lyon recently said that the Japanese government ordered the recall of the cargo ship Nojima Maru of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company in Japan. It will not be allowed to leave Philippine waters unless it unloads the export goods loaded in the Philippines or the export control agency's license. He also said that the ship's port permit has been revoked because it is difficult to determine whether the goods it loaded can reach the United States. The U.S. Neutrality Patrol is said to have taken steps yesterday to prevent the Japanese ship from suddenly leaving the Philippines, because two other Japanese ships carrying chromite to the United States had previously been requisitioned by the Japanese government and unloaded their cargo in Japanese ports. Recently, Diet members Oyama, who recently visited here, said that the Japanese government's withdrawal of Japanese ships traveling between the US and the Philippines is a reaction to the recent US government's restriction on the shipment of key raw materials to Japan. "If we can obtain the US and Philippine goods we need, we will definitely send ships to travel everywhere. He also said that the requisitioned Japanese ships may be diverted to South America, because the things we need are also in South America. Oyama will fly to Hong Kong tomorrow. He also said that he believes that the oil talks between Japan and the Dutch East Indies may reopen. Now the Philippine government is in the process of negotiating because Japan has withdrawn Japanese ships, intending to release the four detained Dutch ships as soon as possible for supply. If the Dutch ships are released by the Philippine authorities, they can sail between the US and the Philippines.

### China Resolutely Severed Relations with Germany and Italy; Impressed British Government and Public; Initiated a Bold Diplomatic Policy; Determined to Fight to the End for Democracy

London: Authoritative British sources commented that the Chinese government's decision to resolutely sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers after Germany and Italy recognized Nanjing was quite satisfactory. The decisive action of China's new Foreign Minister stood in stark contrast to the Japanese government's hesitant and fearful attitude towards the Soviet-German war. Foreign Minister Guo's stern condemnation of the Axis powers had made a deep impression on the British. It was believed that Foreign Minister Guo had begun to implement a bold diplomatic policy, namely: (1) to realize Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's determination to fight to the end for democracy and to unite all peace-loving countries in the world, including the ABC countries mentioned by Foreign Minister Guo before leaving here, plus the Soviet Union. Foreign Minister Guo's proposal has now been proven in fact, demonstrating his foresight; (3) to realize the Chinese people's determination to fight bravely. The purpose of the Axis powers' recognition of Nanjing seemed to be to reduce Japan's displeasure, as Germany's sudden attack on the Soviet Union had put Japan in a rather embarrassing position. Secondly, it was one of the conditions of exchange between the two sides. Although the content of the exchange conditions was not clear, it must have been to win over Japan to continue colluding with the Axis powers and play a role similar to Italy in the Far East, flanking the Soviet rear. It can be asserted that the Axis powers have abandoned their facade of friendship with China. Germany clearly hopes that Japan will advance north or south, leading to a large-scale conflict with Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the Netherlands, so that Germany can safely rule all of Europe.

### British and American Cooperation; Fight for Democracy; Australian Prime Minister Delivers Speech; Portuguese Ships Hoist Flags to Salute the United States

Reuters, London, 5th: Australia and Canada both released speeches yesterday on British-American cooperation in the fight for democracy to commemorate American Independence Day. Australian Prime Minister Menzies said, "Americans and Australians are standing on common ground. Australians are increasingly convinced that Americans will never tolerate Nazi domination of the world. American aid has greatly increased the rate of victory and greatly reduced the evils of war. Therefore, Americans, like Australians, have the responsibility not only to free those living today, but also to free future generations from hardship. Australia is fighting not only for the freedom of Australia, but also for the freedom of the United States and the world. This is Australia's honor." The Australian Prime Minister concluded by saying that the two peoples, whose common ancestors conquered the wilderness with grace and courage, will never succumb to a world order that eliminates individual rights. When he was in the United States last month, he felt very much at home because not only did they speak, think, and act the same, but they were equally committed to upholding the rights of mankind. The Canadian Automobile Association Joint Conference stated that there are currently more than 6,000 Americans serving in the Canadian Army. Britain is a bastion of freedom, now guarded by the fighting spirit of the British military and civilians.

The British Royal Air Force, which launched this decisive raid, had carried out a heavy bombing of the port of Bremen and the Essen location of the Krupp factory the night before, only an hour or two apart.

In other areas, there were only outpost activities and minor clashes. In the area of Borisov (northeast of Minsk), several enemy vanguards attempted to cross the Berezina River, but were repelled everywhere by us. A part of the enemy attempted to break into the south of Ternopol, but our army resisted throughout the night, preventing the enemy from advancing. The battle is still underway. Also, on July 2nd, our air force destroyed 61 enemy aircraft, and our own aircraft lost 28."

The German army suffered heavy casualties. According to Moscow wireless, there has been no actual change on the Soviet front.

The enemy troops repeatedly attempted to cross the river, but were repelled by our firepower. The enemy troops suffered heavy losses on land and water. Because the enemy troops were unable to advance in the Trakana Pril area, they have turned to attack the areas of Novogrudok and Volinsk. Our army won victories throughout the night, preventing the eastward advance of enemy tanks.

United Press, Moscow, 5th: According to the official communiqué released yesterday, the Red Army's resistance to the German's massive advance on the defense line in the Tevitzk region was quite successful.

### Compilation of German War Reports

Reuters, London, 5th: A Soviet news agency transmitted that the Soviet army is currently retreating on the old Soviet border in 1938. Berlin now expects the German army to have a new fierce battle with the main Soviet army along the so-called Stalin Line. The Berlin Nazi Party said that the Stalin Line extends from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, with closely connected fortresses. The Red Army must try to contain the German army's advance on this line. The German army and its allies are now rapidly approaching the Stalin Line. The Nazi side believes that the Soviet side does not have much hope of holding this line for long, because the Red Army has suffered heavy losses in eastern Poland and the Baltic countries. The German news agency also claimed that the Soviet army, which was heavily deployed on the border, has been dispersed and broken through by the German army. The Soviet army's equipment and aircraft losses are extremely heavy and cannot be replenished. At the same time, the German side admitted that large-scale battles are still underway behind the German front, because the trapped Soviet army continues to resist stubbornly. The German army is currently searching for scattered Soviet troops throughout the area. The Ukrainian capital, Kiev, is gradually facing a new threat from the south. The German side said that the Hungarian army in the south has crossed the Carpathian Mountains and reached the plains, and has joined forces with the right wing of the German army in eastern Poland. The Soviet army, which stubbornly resisted in the narrow passes of the Carpathian Mountains, was defeated by the Hungarian army on Thursday. The Hungarian air force assisted the army in fiercely attacking Soviet columns. German newspapers continued to carry various messages indicating the Soviet army's determination to counterattack, one of which said, "A German team in the Dubno district has been containing the fierce attack of hundreds of Soviet 50-ton tanks for three days. The German anti-tank guns constantly bombarded, piercing the armor of the Soviet tanks and destroying their steel towers, destroying many of the heaviest Soviet tanks. The German team then attacked, seizing six Soviet artillery pieces and a large number of armored vehicles." The German side also reported that it has captured 123 aircraft fields and all modern equipment built by the Soviet side in the Baltic countries last year, including 11 that were intact. In a surprise attack by the German army near Daugavpils, three more aircraft fields were captured. In the past 24 hours, 98 Soviet aircraft have been destroyed, including 22 destroyed on the ground and 76 destroyed in air combat. German dive bombers destroyed a train near Murmansk, and in the central region (Belarus), Soviet trains, stations, railways, bridges, and concentrated troops were also heavily bombed by German aircraft, destroying 34 tanks.

The German army encountered strong resistance in several places, but did not encounter major obstacles in other places. The Red Army has withdrawn to the Dnieper River and is fighting a rearguard battle in the front between Ternopol (in Poland) and Sairnochi (in Romania). The German strategy is to encircle Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, in a pincer movement from Poland, Volgrad Volinsk, to the Danube Delta. The German army that crossed the Lehina River in the north is also advancing on Kiev.

### Soviets Prepare for Long-Term Resistance; Napoleon's Defeat Serves as a Cautionary Tale

Stockholm, 4th (Havas Agency) – Military observers here recently stated that it is still too early to say whether Stalin is adopting General Kutuzov's strategy from the Napoleonic Wars to block the German advance. Regarding the current war situation, the Red Army has launched major counter-offensives in the central and southern sectors, while adopting a defensive posture in the northern sector, offering determined resistance to the German forces. According to Soviet war reports, the Soviet authorities deeply hope that after the introduction of new-style giant tanks and twin-engine bombers, the battlefront situation can be turned from defeat to victory. Various phenomena indicate that the Soviet Union is preparing for a long-term war of attrition. On the one hand, it is actively mobilizing the people and organizing local defense forces. Factories and collective farms have received large quantities of arms and begun training. All cadre personnel are filled with loyal communists to prepare for future guerrilla warfare. On the other hand, a scorched earth policy is being adopted. All materials in the occupied areas are being transported out as much as possible. If it is too late to move them due to the urgency of the situation, they are destroyed to prevent them from benefiting the enemy. Stalin has ordered all materials within Estonia to be moved to Leningrad, and similar measures are being taken elsewhere.

Referring to Britain's attitude towards the treaty, Saydam concluded: "This attitude of Britain is a manifestation of the confidence possessed by a gentlemanly nation." He also stated that the major crisis sweeping the ground has now reached the Turkish border.

Jerusalem, 5th (Reuters) – It is learned here that in addition to capturing Palmyra, Allied forces in Syria have also occupied Deir ez-Zor, greatly enhancing their position in eastern Syria. These two cities were strongholds of the Vichy forces in the region. Deir ez-Zor is located 120 miles northeast of Palmyra on the Euphrates River. The Allied forces occupying this famous grassland can use it as a base to attack the important cities of Homs and Aleppo to the north. Most of those who occupied Deir ez-Zor are Indian troops, who mainly set out from Iraq and crossed the border into Syria near Kamar. Indian troops have also achieved military successes in the Damascus area, continuously launching surprise attacks to assist the Allied forces in entering the Syrian capital.

Vichy, 5th (Reuters) – A communique issued by General Dentz, commander of the Vichy forces in Syria, did not mention the fall of Deir ez-Zor, but stated that "enemy tanks have been in contact with Vichy forces along one route, while Vichy forces in southern Syria have repelled Allied attacks, capturing many enemies. Patrols and artillery units are active along the coast south of Beirut. French aircraft are still actively bombing and strafing Allied forces."

Ankara, 5th (United Press) – According to reports here yesterday, the Syrian war may be ended within a week by peaceful negotiations between the two sides' armies. Although British sources deny the possibility of an armistice agreement being established, it is widely believed that negotiations are already underway secretly. It is reported that Mr. Mesnil, assistant to the French High Commissioner, has held talks with Mr. Rossom, the representative of the German-Italian Armistice Commission sent to Syria, in the past ten days. It is rumored that the two officials will soon return to Aleppo in an attempt to conduct armistice negotiations with the British side here.

### Vichy Envoy Returns Home from Turkey

Vichy, 4th (Havas Agency) – Mr. Mesnil, assistant to the Cabinet High Commissioner, representing Marshal Pétain, went to Istanbul, the capital of Turkey, to meet with various important figures in that country. There have been rumors that the purpose of this trip was to request Turkey to allow France to transport arms through its territory to Syria or to allow the French forces in Syria to withdraw back to France through its territory. This statement has been denied by political figures here, who stated that Mesnil only carried a letter from Marshal Pétain to Turkish President Ismet. When he met with President Ismet, the President asked him to convey his congratulations on France's revival to Marshal Pétain. The relations between France and Turkey have always been extremely close, and it is certain that they will become even more cordial in the future. The Franco-Turkish alliance established in June 1939 has also been reiterated by both sides. At this time of tension in the Near East situation, the significance of Mesnil's trip is self-evident. In addition, it is possible to resolve trade issues between the two countries, that is, to extend the validity period of the current commercial agreement.

Although Sino-American Trading offered to sell, it was difficult to curb the strong buying, and the market closed at the tightest price. British currency was at 3/4 pence at 23.4375, and US dollars at 5.21875, both tighter than HSBC's official rates. Trading was extremely active in the morning.

Because Chinese and foreign merchants were willing to supply US dollars at 5.28125, and there were rumors that the stabilization fund would maintain the black market US dollar at 5.25 and that the United States would issue new $25 bills, the buying subsided temporarily. However, after 10:30 AM, a rumor suddenly spread that banks would stop supplying forward US dollars, causing panic among speculative shorts who rushed to cover their positions in July and August at 5.28125 to 5.25. Favreau, Hua Bi, and others absorbed US dollars for July at 5.25. Sino-American Trading's willingness to supply diminished at midday, and the price of gold soared beyond 6,600 yuan.

It was then noted that firms like Cheng Ji, De Da, Gong Da, Da Feng, Xiang Xing Yong, Tian Yuan, and Heng Ji were selling. There were also rumors that Chinese and foreign firms were willing to supply US dollars at 5.28125, and that the US would issue new $25 bills, and that the Stabilization Fund would maintain the black market US dollar at 5.25. This halted the rise and caused a slight dip to 6,552 yuan. However, after 10:30 AM, Xiang He, Ming Feng, Chi Da, and De Fu came to absorb the supply, gradually pushing the price back up. When rumors circulated of a favorable turn for buyers and the foreign exchange market suddenly tightened again, Tian Yuan, Xin Feng Yong, Yi Da, and others also aggressively bought, and those with floating profits took the opportunity to push prices up sharply, breaking through the 6,600 yuan mark.

### Food: Rice Merchants Advocate Supply Shortage, But More and More Foreign Rice Arrives; Five Ships Arrive in One Day with Over 160,000 Bags; Even if Southern Advance is Achieved, Will Rice Prices Necessarily Be High?

Rice hoarders are proclaiming a shortage of supply and dwindling stockpiles, thinking of taking the opportunity to raise prices and manipulate the market, hindering the people's access to food. Fortunately, large quantities of foreign rice are arriving in Shanghai. The French public company's General Joffre mail ship arrived yesterday morning, carrying 39,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, unloading at the Hongshun Tai Wharf. The Hua Lun Shipping Company's Grant steamer, carrying 27,150 bags of Public Warehouse rice from Rangoon, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning.

The Taikoo Company's Guangdong steamer also arrived in Shanghai in the morning, carrying 15,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, docking at the Bund Wharf in the French Concession. Whether this is the Public Warehouse's low-price rice is unknown, so it could not be verified due to the lack of information. In total, yesterday's five ships brought in a massive 162,150 bags of foreign rice. Facts speak louder than words, but rice hoarders will use the Japanese occupation of Vietnam as an excuse to raise prices. However, considering the overall situation, no matter how the situation changes, it will not be as the rice merchants hope, and rice will not be so expensive as to starve the masses. (Zu)

The foreign rice market recently has been in a state of uncertainty. Yesterday, it continued its fluctuating pattern of rising first and then falling. However, speculative hoarders are very greedy, with groups from the west of Shanghai and the interior being particularly active. Although there was no smooth sale for actual customers, the market price was gradually pushed up by raising and releasing prices. Not only did it rise above the previous day's closing price, but it also exceeded the previous day's highest price, once rising by as much as two or three. Subsequently, due to the continuous arrival of new supplies, retailers with surplus and profiteering floating buyers were eager to sell at high prices, and the market rose and then fell. As a result, it was still about one yuan higher than the previous evening. Number 2 Luo Siam Yinghua Company was at 144.5 yuan, while small Jiao spot was all from 150 yuan to 151 yuan, reaching as high as 151.5 yuan. Broken rice opened only at 113 yuan for medium-grade goods, with over 1,000 tons traded. There were no fewer than 20,000 bags of spot rice, but most of them were taken in by hoarders. Actual sales accounted for less than 30%, because it was expensive and difficult to transport, and demand was not strong. The local merchants were stabilized by the public sale, while the hoarders were confused by international changes and currency rumors, and were absorbing supply.

Thick and thin japonica rice and domestic rice saw different situations yesterday, and the market conditions also diverged. The South Port fresh early and late rice, due to its scarcity, became more and more popular, and the selling price continued to rise by two to three yuan, opening as high as 142 yuan, settling at 140.5 yuan. Wuxi original-packaged old japonica rice, due to the seasonal relationship, had changed in quality and lacked interest, so the market was flat, opening at 132 yuan, then falling to 127 to 128 yuan.

Glutinous rice, whether domestic or foreign, saw a decline in sales. Although the market supply was limited, sellers still tried to hold up the price, but they were unable to do so, and could only follow the foreign rice market in presenting a firm situation. The price was similar to before, with Hong Kong high white glutinous rice selling for 123-124 yuan, medium grade for 120 yuan, special glutinous green for 114 yuan, and ordinary glutinous green for 112 yuan, settling at 108 yuan. Jin Dan domestic glutinous rice ranged from 123-124 yuan, settling at around 120 yuan.

### Customer Sales Active; Flour Market Trends Higher Again

Yesterday's spot flour market saw active sales to customers and strong purchases by customers and hoarders, fueled by numerous positive news in the local market and rising prices in the financial and rice markets. Golden Dragon flour opened at 32.80 yuan and quickly rose to 33.25 yuan, with Turret flour also rising to 34 yuan, and Five Swallow brand American flour at 33.40 yuan, a gain of 4-5 cents from the previous day. There were also numerous direct sales to customers of various other brands. All goods rose by 3-4 cents, with total market sales of over 20,000 bags, half of which were actual sales and the rest were speculative transactions. Wheat saw quiet supply and demand. Day factories occasionally purchased, with only 30-50 bags, and the price remained around 40 yuan. The miscellaneous grains market will be closed for the 7/7 anniversary, reopening on the 8th as usual.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Oil Cake Moves Without Smooth Sales

Yesterday's soybean oil cake sales moved but were not smooth. Hoarders were also mostly in a wait-and-see attitude. Transactions were mostly small and scattered, with the market presenting a flat and soft appearance. The market saw the sale of 30 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 100 loads of Da You factory soybean oil, 300 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan, over 100 bags of Jiaozhou soybeans, 100 bags of Guid German soybeans, 300 bags of Qingkou soybeans, 3,000 pieces of Da You soybean cake, 1,400 pieces of Lu Zi soybean cake, 2,000 pieces of Shen Ji soybean cake, and 15,000 pieces for July delivery. Prices were all slightly lower (see market price section for details). 100 pieces of soybean oil were shipped from Yantai yesterday, as well as 140 cans of butter, shipped from Tianjin.

### Yarn and Cotton Merchants Cautious on Both Sides; Spot Yarn Fluctuations Narrow; Guangdong Yarn Sales Also Appear Sluggish

The yarn market has risen through consolidation, but actual trading has weakened slightly. Due to the shortage of 32-count single yarn and strong demand from Guangdong, market prices have risen daily, so sentiment is good. However, 20-count Double Horse brand single yarn is difficult to sell and the premiums are shortened, so fluctuations are narrower. As for the bankrupt yarn firms, there is still no satisfactory solution, so both sides are cautious and mostly adopt a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for the market to recover its vitality before regrouping and relaunching. Then the market will become prosperous. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,616 yuan, and the low price was 1,595 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the weekend, the market was deserted.

Double Horse opened in the morning with a positive sentiment. Everyone shouted to buy. The opening price was 1,602 yuan, rising directly to 1,615 yuan. Subsequently, because transactions for 20-count yarn from Guangdong were not smooth and there were no new buyers on the market, the situation loosened to 1,595 yuan. Unexpectedly, the spot price rose sharply, and sentiment revived. The final closing price was 1,615 yuan. According to the half-day trading statistics, 4,145 bales were traded, including 145 bales from the Hong Kong group and 4,000 bales of inter-firm transactions.

For the Golden Bell Horse brand yarn market, the opening was flat. It was subsequently reported that spot yarn transactions had declined. Until the close, it was reported that the price of gold had risen and the yarn price rose accordingly. As a result, July was flat, August was slightly higher by one yuan, and September was flat. According to the half-day trading statistics, 12,560 bales were traded, a decrease of 11,440 bales from the previous day. The half-day high, low, and closing prices are listed on the left:

### Rough Cotton Shows Improvement

The current cotton situation remains firm, although trading has decreased somewhat. However, optimism persists because fine cotton raw materials are exceptionally scarce and expensive, making them difficult to move. Therefore, attention has been focused on Indian rough cotton and locally produced "fire engine" cotton. The large-scale purchasing of locally produced "fire engine" cotton by Japanese trading firms has contributed to the strength of rough cotton.

The New York cotton market was closed yesterday.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to selling in Calcutta and profit-taking by bulls. It then stabilized as European exporters began buying. Finally, the market fell again due to further profit-taking and a climate report favorable to bears. Yesterday's closing prices fell by four to seven rupees.

In Shanghai, the foreign cotton market was quiet but firm. Transactions were slightly rare due to frequent orders and an unstable source of supply. Yesterday, besides 500 bales of Brazilian cotton being transacted by foreign factories, only slightly more than 400 bales of Indian and Argentinian cotton were transacted by cotton firms.

### Piece Goods: Bleached Cloth Rises Sharply, Cotton Cloth Recovers in the Afternoon

Factory Cloth: The market initially fell and then rose yesterday. The morning saw a release of floating stocks. Interest from local buyers was weak, creating a soft market. All cloth sales suffered declines, with white cotton, coarse and fine cloth, and twill falling by 2.5 cents. Some bleached and dyed cloth fell by 3.5 cents. However, the sharp rise of bleached cloth at noon triggered purchasing interest among speculators, causing holders to raise prices, leading to a rebound. Ultimately, there was little change compared to the previous day. Afternoon transactions were more active, totaling more than 300 pieces. Guangdong and Hong Kong buyers, such as Huafeng Factory, purchased more than 200 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, khaki cloth, and other goods.

Eastern Cloth: Initially weak, eventually rising. The closing price for fine cloth futures for the July term fell by 4 cents, while the October term rose by 7 cents. In the spot market, Saturday's trading was quiet. The closing price for Dragon Head fine cloth was also down 1 cent, at 48.8 yuan. Jean rose by 0.25 cents, to 1.6225 yuan. However, the market suddenly rose after the close due to rising margin calls, creating a strong bullish atmosphere. Transactions for Dragon Head fine cloth reached 49.6 yuan off the market, while Flying Fish fine cloth also saw transactions at 49 yuan.

Exports: 100 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai today, and another 30 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.

### Though Expensive, Woolen Fabrics Are Still Sought After

(Spring Goods): These can still be sold because the new autumn season has not yet arrived. Most of the trading is still active, with many prices remaining firm and few falling.

(Summer Goods): Sales are excellent, although most of the peak sales period has passed. Therefore, trading is mostly small and fragmented. Paris flannel, "Fan Er Ding" feather yarn, linen, waxed thread, and "glue cloth" are selling particularly well. Prices are stable because the season is late.

(Autumn Goods): These have been selling the best recently. Wholesale dealers are busy with daily transactions. Sales of locally produced goods are much more active than imported goods. Riding breeches cloth, "Tuo Si Jin," yellow "Hua Te" cloth, and yellow serge are trading particularly well. Worsted suit fabrics priced around 40 yuan are the most popular.

(Winter Goods): These are selling even better than other woolen fabrics, and prices are rising alarmingly. The main reason is the perception that the current European war situation will make shipping difficult and supplies scarce. This leads to most people hoarding them, treating them like precious treasures. Despite the high prices, there are still many buyers, which is quite surprising.

### North-South Goods: New Golden Lily Buds Go on Sale

New golden lily buds from various producing areas have been harvested successively. It is reported that this year's output is fairly good and will be shipped to Shanghai. A small amount of Qingjiang goods arrived yesterday and went on sale immediately, priced at 250 yuan. The quality of the goods is just average.

### Hainan Dried Longan Soars

Hainan dried longan prices are soaring because the goods will soon be released, pushing vendors to increase their prices. Cold-stored goods are now selling at 35 yuan, with 10 transactions. At the same time, the asking price has also risen to 50,000 yuan. Sales of large-sized dried longan have been rare recently, and the asking price has risen by over 20 yuan, seemingly set to rise rapidly.

### Sugar Market: Table Sugar Steady

The sugar market was stable yesterday, with no significant changes. The exchange's price for Grade 24 coarse granulated white sugar for April arrival was 91.7 to 91.8 yuan, May arrival was 92.55 yuan, and June arrival was 92.7 yuan. Sugar arriving on the 26th of last month was priced at 93.7 to 95.6 yuan. Taikoo's "Car White" B brand was 109 yuan, and HX brand was 91.5 yuan, both clearly for immediate delivery. Dutch red KD brand was 74.2 yuan, and TMLNT brand was 72 yuan. Furthermore, Taikoo Sugar transported 4,100 bags of sugar from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Seafood: New Jellyfish Plentiful

New jellyfish has arrived on the market. A batch was recently shipped, and this year's output is reported to be abundant. New jellyfish skin is selling for 140 yuan, while old stock requires 165 yuan. New jellyfish head is 110 yuan, and old stock is 125 yuan. Cold dishes are most suitable in this hot summer, so sales are very active.

### New Shrimp Offerings

The first batch of new shrimp has arrived in small quantities and is of excellent quality. Ningbo shrimp is selling for 250 yuan, old stock for 200 yuan, and Zhoushan new shrimp for 395 yuan, a significant increase of 15 yuan compared to the previous market.

### Grade One Pepper is Extremely Popular

The pepper market has recently stabilized. White pepper and large black pepper have not changed much, maintaining their previous prices. However, Grade One pepper is extremely popular, so the asking price yesterday was 150 yuan.

### Coal: Coal Quietly Stabilizes

Coal dregs and various other coal types have returned to inactivity. Sales to customers remain sluggish. Besides a few scattered transactions, there have been no large-scale sales. Therefore, the market is flat, with no significant fluctuations. Yesterday, Indian coal dregs sold for 360 yuan per ton, Kaiping dregs for 348 yuan, and Grade Two dregs for 320 yuan. The above prices are for inter-dealer transactions, ex-warehouse delivery, delivered to customers with a small handling fee added.

### Taiwanese Coke Squeezes In

The price of coke varies greatly. High-end coke such as Kaiping coke and Zhongxing coke is priced above 1,000 yuan, which is alarming. Not much stock has arrived, and there are few wholesale transactions. It was recently reported that Taiwanese coke in straw bags has been loaded at a certain wharf in Hongkou, about 300 tons. The pieces are small and broken, and the quality is poor, so the price is relatively low. Lump coal is priced at 400 yuan per ton, ex-truck, and there are many interested buyers.

The above nine items are important tasks in the commemoration of China's resistance and the aid-China movement. The progress of public diplomacy between China and Britain has already merged into one, shoulder to shoulder in the battle for democracy.

### Belgian Ambassador to Arrive in Shanghai the Day After Tomorrow

Belgian Ambassador to China, Mr. Guillaume, flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong. He originally intended to take a boat to Shanghai that day. However, he encountered a typhoon in Hong Kong, so the Ambassador had to stay for a while. According to relevant sources, the typhoon in Hong Kong and the surrounding area has now passed, so the Ambassador has already set off for Shanghai. He may arrive in Shanghai the day after tomorrow (the 8th).

### Customs-Guaranteed Internal Debt Principal and Interest: Current Method, Still Collected in Six Installments

The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank is ordered to handle the discounting and payment of principal and interest of internal debt guaranteed by customs duties.

(2) Various principal and interest coupons of Unification Bonds can be filled in on one form. If there are both Unification and Reconstruction Bonds, they should be filled in on two forms.

### Authorities in Both Concessions Adopt Joint Alert: Defense Forces and Merchant Corps Mobilized to Assist, Unnecessary Lanes and Alleys to be Locked

The authorities of the two concessions have decided to adopt joint alert measures to prevent gatherings and protect the security of the concessions in order to eliminate sources of disorder. Starting today, all police officers of the affiliated police stations will be mobilized. The garrison forces stationed in Shanghai and the International Settlement Volunteer Corps will also assist in the defense. As for unnecessary roads, bridges, lanes, and alleys, traffic will be restricted as needed. All armored vehicles, patrol teams, and male and female inspection teams will be dispatched to patrol in different areas and implement interception searches of hotel areas and designated mobile searches to prevent villains from hiding.

### Five Foreign Ships Imported Yesterday, Arriving with 160,000 Bags of Rice, Public Granary Rice Also Arrived via Grand Line Ship, Rice Market Still Controlled, Rice Prices Abnormal, Bean and Grain Warehouse Workers Requested Increase in Pay and Treatment, Walkout Due to Failure

A large batch of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The French Far East Shipping Company's General Joffre mail ship arrived from Saigon with 39,000 bags and docked at the Shanghai Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. The French ship S.S.G.G.Varenne, managed by Wah Lun & Co., arrived from Saigon with 34,000 bags and also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, docking at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong for unloading. In addition, the Thai-flagged S.S.Suiythai Nawa arrived from Rangoon with 47,000 bags yesterday afternoon and docked at the Shanghai Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. The import of this Thai ship is managed by the British Lishi Trading Company, and exports are still handled by Tongyi and Taishengli. The Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, loading 15,000 bags of rice from Hong Kong and docking at the Bund of the French Concession for unloading.

Public Granary Rice Similar to Hong Kong Rice

Wah Lun & Co.'s Norwegian ship Grand Line arrived from Rangoon with 27,150 bags of public granary rice yesterday morning. It was originally scheduled to dock at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong, but after arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, the company ordered it to change to the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. When reporters visited the ship, they saw that the quality of this public granary rice was similar to that of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Hong Kong rice, which is ordinary small-grain rice. According to the current market price, each stone is 122.5 yuan. However, the authorities decided to sell it to local households in Shanghai at a price of 110 yuan. The method is for the Public Granary Management Committee to sell it all to the Shanghai Municipal Council, and then the Shanghai Municipal Council will distribute it to various rice shops for sale. It is reported that the second and third batches of public granary rice will also be shipped from Rangoon to Shanghai. In total, 162,150 bags of foreign rice arrived yesterday.

Bean and Grain Warehouse Workers Walkout

The bean, rice, and grain warehouse workers in this city, because their monthly income is not enough to cover their expenses, jointly submitted a request to the industry association for increased wages and improved treatment, including: (1) Warehouse workers' salaries should be increased by seven times based on the original salaries in 1937. If the increase is less than 70 yuan, it should be calculated as 70 yuan. (2) Warehouse labor should be increased by two times. If the increase is less than four points, it should be calculated as four points. (3) A monthly allowance of five "dou" of white rice per person. (4) Five days of promotion pay should be issued per month. (5) Red river workers should be treated the same as employees, etc. These five items have been requested three times. The employer did not accept them because the conditions were too high. All warehouse workers, together with dockworkers, began a joint walkout on the previous day. However, the strike by the rice warehouse workers has a significant impact on people's livelihood. It is hoped that the employers in the industry will accept the demands put forward by the workers in order to maintain their livelihoods together.

Despite Large Rice Arrivals, Rice Prices Persist

Yesterday, the rice market situation was affected by numerous rumors, and hoarders became active again. However, speculative elements felt that a large amount of foreign rice was arriving, inventory was increasing rapidly, and the Shanghai Municipal Council's cheap rice continued to be handled continuously, causing actual sales to decrease greatly. They fabricated various rumors to induce the general public to buy in large quantities to achieve their goals. Therefore, the price of rice in each stall rose slightly yesterday. However, this phenomenon will only be a flash in the pan and cannot last. Since the facts are all there, how can it continue to be concealed? Therefore, rice prices must eventually fall.

Dispatch of Vehicles Transporting Rice and Grain

Rubber-wheeled small carts and trucks for transporting rice and grain have formed a cooperative society to adjust transportation work in the industry. Workers from the rice shops and shippers have joined and have been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council. Starting yesterday, all cargo matters at various wharves and foreign godowns will be handled by the cooperative society. In total, there are 350 small carts and 70 trucks dedicated to transportation. In order to reduce accidental losses in rice shops, in the future, if there are any accidents involving vehicles, all those transported by the cooperative society will be compensated at the original price. Therefore, the rice shop association has also issued a notice to all members to support it in order to reduce losses.

### Xiangshan Port Blockaded, Zhejiang Ships to Shanghai Anchored in Donggou

According to shipping industry sources, Xiangshan Port in eastern Zhejiang was recently blockaded by the Japanese fleet stationed in China, prohibiting all ships from entering and leaving. The ships entering and leaving the port are all sailing ships and fishing boats. Since the outbreak of the war in eastern Zhejiang, fishing boats have had no fish to catch and have mostly been used to carry passengers, specializing in carrying passengers from places such as Shipu and Xiepu to Shanghai. Therefore, although the decision was blocked, besides these ships being unable to return to the port, there was no impact. Currently, passenger ships from Shipu and Xiepu to Shanghai are endless, sometimes several a day, all fully loaded with passengers. They are all coming to Shanghai to make a living due to hunger, and most of them are women and children. However, according to passengers, the wind and waves in the sea have been very strong recently, and the sailing ships are unbearable, so there are many dangers. Passengers taking these ships have endured hardships. All ships are anchored in Donggou, Pudong, after arriving in Shanghai, so that place has become a concentration of sailing ships coming to Shanghai from eastern Zhejiang.

### French Municipal Council Staff, Ordered to Pledge Allegiance to Vichy, Otherwise Regarded as Traitors

The French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme, recently stated that he recently received an order from the Vichy government instructing all French staff serving in the Shanghai French Municipal Council to take an oath immediately to express their allegiance to the Vichy government, otherwise they would be discriminated against and regarded as traitors. However, the Free French in Shanghai expressed their opposition. The Shanghai French Municipal Council has received a notice from the French Ambassador, limited to reporting by the 10th of this month. It is reported that the Shanghai French Municipal Council has expressed its compliance. The oath papers can be collected and sent to the Embassy next week. However, the French Police Department is considering whether to comply with this order and has not yet announced it.

### Industrial and Social Affairs Office Planning to Set Up Industrial Training Night School, Designed Specifically for Adult Workers, Divided into Two Schools with a Fixed Number of 160 People

On the 4th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial and Social Affairs Office held this year's industrial technology and safety training class at the Jindu Grand Theater on Avenue Foch, holding a ceremony to issue certificates to students. More than 1,000 guests attended, all from the machinery industry. A total of 190 trainees received certificates.

Technical Training

Ms. Xie De, Director of the Industrial and Social Affairs Office, presided over the meeting. During the meeting, it was announced that two technical training night schools are planned to be held in September, designed specifically for adult workers. Dr. Minsider, Chairman of the Education Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, spoke at the meeting, followed by Mr. Jin Zhixuan, an engineer approved and registered by the Shanghai Municipal Council (i.e., the future teacher of the night school), who clarified the significance of the above plan. Mr. Shen Jichao, head of the technical training department of the office, explained the details of the night school.

Academic Content

The school is planned to be set up in the Shanghai Municipal Council school building, one at 25 Avenue Mabille in western Shanghai and one at Jingzhou Road in the eastern district. It is scheduled to have classes three times a week, two hours each time. The subjects taught include machinery workshop practice, workshop calculation, basic physics, machine drawing and design, mechanical installation, etc. The tuition fee is five yuan per semester. Those who have completed the limited period of apprenticeship and are able to pass the entrance examination can enroll. The entrance examination is scheduled to be held on August 18. Applicants must submit a written statement outlining their education and apprenticeship status to the Industrial and Social Affairs Office for review. In addition, the night school plans to enroll the 160 students with the best entrance examination results in the first year.

### Citibank's Beiping and Guangzhou Branches Close, Merged into Tianjin and Hong Kong Branches Respectively

Due to the special commercial conditions in Beiping and Guangzhou, Citibank's Beiping and Guangzhou branches have decided to merge their businesses into the Tianjin and Hong Kong Citibank branches starting on July 31 and August 31 of this year, respectively. From the above-mentioned merger dates, all inquiries regarding the Beiping and Guangzhou branches should be contacted to the Tianjin and Hong Kong branches.

### Harmonious Labor-Management Relations in Tea Shops, Agreement Signed Yesterday

The labor-management dispute in more than 500 tea shops in the city has been resolved satisfactorily after open consultations by representatives from both sides. The employer has agreed not to dismiss employees without cause, and 28% of the annual surplus of each shop will be used for profit-sharing. Employees' salaries are divided into nine levels, with the lowest increased to 24 yuan and the highest increased to 110 yuan. Yesterday, the employer sent Zhen Huan and the labor sent Jiang Jingbo as representatives of both parties to officially sign and take effect. Therefore, the labor-management dispute in the industry has now been resolved satisfactorily. It is reported that employees of each shop are satisfied with the agreement.

### National Liberation War Must Have All-People Service, Continental Daily Calls for Enforcement of Military Service Law, Taking Chairman Chiang as a Model

Recently, the Military Affairs Commission launched a campaign for the sons of gentry and civil servants to join the army. On the 2nd, Chairman Chiang issued a telegram ordering all localities to comply. The English-language Continental Daily in this city commented on this yesterday, stating that the payment of substitutes for military service was a phenomenon in the American Civil War. At that time, the bourgeoisie was unwilling to perform military service and abandoned their national obligations.

Bourgeoisie to Enforce Together

Now China's military service law stipulates that anyone who reaches the age of enlistment must serve the country. However, in fact, this regulation has not been enforced by the bourgeoisie. This is the weakness of China's social system. China is carrying out a national liberation war for freedom and should not rely solely on the bloodshed and sweat of the Chinese working masses.

Feudal Concepts Should Not Exist

Now that they have served the most in this great struggle compared to other classes, if China's war in the future relies solely on them, then their lofty consciousness will be deeply unhappy because the sons of the bourgeoisie can be exempted from military service. The feudal concept of Chinese society is deeply ingrained, so some noble children can be exempted from military service, not because they are willing to do so, but because their families prevent them from fulfilling their national duties.

Urgent Need for Sacrificial Spirit

Although their parents are unwilling to sacrifice their children for the country, unless their parents do not know the pain of national subjugation, we must understand the importance of this sacrifice for the country. China needs the entire nation to have a sacrificial spirit, which is more urgent than any other country. China needs every people to have the lofty will and personality like Chairman Chiang to solve the various difficulties of the country. China must make the military service law enforceable everywhere, regardless of the poverty or wealth of the classes, and then China will forever become a great nation, striving to protect the well-being of all mankind.

### Son of a Numerologist Kidnapped, Rescued Yesterday, Ransom Note Demands 150,000 Yuan, Three Bandits Captured During Yesterday's Negotiations

Zhang Xietang's numerology hall, located at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Villemon in the French Concession, has a good business, which has been coveted by kidnappers. At 4:00 p.m. on the 1st of this month, Zhang's son, Zhang Daqing, who was only eight years old, was playing in the Shangde Lane nearby.

Suddenly Reported Missing

After searching everywhere to no avail, Zhang reported the disappearance of the child to the French police. Several days passed without any news. Yesterday, Zhang suddenly received a letter from the bandits demanding a ransom of 150,000 yuan and specifying that someone should be sent to Zhaofeng Garden in western Shanghai at 7:00 p.m. that afternoon to negotiate.

Proceed to Negotiate

Zhang sent the letter to the French police, and the head of the police instructed several detectives from the criminal department to go in disguise, together with police officers from the Special Police Department, and arrived on time, arresting two bandits negotiating on the spot and confiscating a live handgun, and confessing the location of the hostage.

Hiding Place

Immediately rushed to the address and rescued the little hostage Zhang Daqing on the spot, and continued to capture two bandits guarding him, and took them back to the French police for investigation. As for the little hostage Zhang Daqing, he was immediately escorted back to his residence.

### Woman Uses Fake Ornaments to Deceive and Exchange for Real Goods, Many Jewelers Affected, Arrested and Detained Once Discovered

Zhang Zhang, an Anhui woman, is 27 years old. Her husband, Zhang, is currently in the army. Zhang is an old woman, dressed in modern style. In the past one or two months, she has gone to more than ten stores, including Tianchang Jewelry Store at 578 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, Zhenchang Diamond Shop on the same road, and Lianfa Secondhand Store on Avenue Foch, on the pretext of buying jewelry and secretly exchanged fake ones for real ones. The value of the deceived items reached tens of thousands of yuan. The day before yesterday, Zhang went to China Jewelry Store, opened by Cai Shuren at 339 Avenue Foch, and used her old trick to exchange fake ones for real ones. She was discovered by the store clerk, who obtained evidence of the stolen goods and called the police to arrest her and take her to the police station.

### Gang Constable Kills Three in a Case Stemming from Romantic Jealousy: Encounter at a Bookstore Leads to a Love Triangle and a Gruesome Murder-Suicide

The incident of a Huabao (Chinese Constable) surnamed Hua absconding from his post and killing three people the day before yesterday (the 4th), followed by his suicide out of fear of punishment, is truly a bizarre and tragic occurrence in the city's assassination cases of recent years. It is understood that this bloody case originated from a love quadrangle, with the protagonist Wang Lijuan (aka Mrs. Sun Wang) maintaining relationships with Qin Li and Constable Hua despite being married to Sun Jinyuan. This led to the unfortunate incident. Currently, only Wang Lijuan remains hospitalized for treatment; the other three have died one after another. The details will be further chronicled below.

**Father Assists Daughter in Hospitality at the Huyuan Bookstore**

Wang A'gen, a native of Changshu, operates the Huyuan Bookstore at 190 Kuling Road. His daughter, Lijuan, assists her father in hosting the audience. She developed romantic relationships with three customers of the bookstore: Sun Jinyuan, Constable Hua (from Zhenjiang, 28 years old, residing at Lane 56, No. 3 Meibage Road), and Qin Li, a student at Zhijiang University. Ultimately, Sun emerged victorious, and on January 1st of last year, they officially married at the Yingbinlou Restaurant on Simalu (the 4th Avenue). They rented a small room in the kitchen area at Lane 38, No. 18 Meibage Road. Wang still frequented the Huyuan Bookstore, and Constable Hua and student Qin Li also used listening to the storytelling as an excuse to meet with Wang, as in the past. Sun Jinyuan was truly a thorn in the side of Qin and Hua.

**Smiling and Chatting, a Sudden Murderous Impulse Arises**

According to eyewitnesses from nearby residents, Constable Hua was stationed at the intersection of Meibage Road and Burke Road every morning. Recently, he had been transferred to the intersection of Meibage Road and Jing'an Temple Road. On the day of the incident, around 11:00 AM, Qin Li and the constable were seen whispering to each other for a long time. Around 11:30 AM, the two went together to Sun Jinyuan's house, chatting and laughing along the way. Unexpectedly, as soon as they arrived in front of Sun's house, Hua suddenly pulled out a pistol and fired a shot at Qin's head. Blood splattered everywhere, and Qin fell to the ground in front of the house. Hua then carried the gun into the kitchen, where Sun was still asleep. He fired three shots at him and immediately turned around and fled, hoping to escape. However, as soon as he reached the entrance of the lane, Sun's wife, Wang Lijuan, returned from buying groceries. Hua raised his gun and fired two shots at her face and abdomen. At this point, only one bullet remained in Hua's pistol. He aimed it at his head, fired, and fell to the ground next to Wang.

**Wang's Life is Still in Danger Despite Hospitalization**

Hua and Sun died from their severe injuries upon arrival at the hospital. Qin also died from his injuries at 2:00 PM that afternoon. Wang Lijuan's injuries were relatively minor; the shot to her face was not a major issue. However, the bullet in her abdomen had not passed through. Although the bullet was surgically removed at Baolong Hospital yesterday, she lost too much blood, and her life is still in danger. According to reports, there were no prior quarrels or altercations before the incident. Hua's sudden action surprised all the residents in the lane. According to a Chinese constable who was Hua's colleague, this incident was generally believed to be a result of jealousy. It was said that Qin Li encouraged Hua to kill Sun, but Hua himself, for some unknown reason, changed his mind and decided to commit suicide after killing Wang.

### Two Public Buses Vandalized Yesterday, Incidents Occurred on Yuyuan Road

A public bus numbered 15167 of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, running on Route 9, was carrying passengers from Jing'an Temple westward yesterday around 11:00 AM. When it reached a certain point on Yuyuan Road, more than a dozen men lying in wait by the roadside, each wielding wooden sticks and other weapons, blocked the way. They forced the passengers, ticket seller, and driver off the bus and proceeded to smash all the windows. They then scattered. Afterward, the driver and others reported the incident to the company. Around 12:00 PM, another bus, numbered 15104, on the same route was also ambushed and vandalized on the same road.

### Shi Zhenghong's Fan Calligraphy Collaboration with Painter Hu Yaguang

Shi Zhenghong from Yun Jian has been renowned in literary circles for his poetry and prose for the past twenty years. It was only recently discovered that his calligraphy is also exquisite. Shi himself claims that his poetry surpasses his prose, and his calligraphy surpasses his poetry. However, he is usually busy with teaching duties and has no time to hold a brush. Taking advantage of this vacation, he has collaborated with the famous West Lake painter Hu Yaguang on one hundred painted fans. Each fan is modestly priced at ten yuan. Since the news spread, requests have poured in, and the quota will soon be filled. No further requests will be accepted. Submissions can be made to Mr. Tan at the dispatch department of Shen Bao Newspaper Office, and Da Jing Middle School in Qingyuan Li, Henan Road, Beijing Road.

### Friends Turn Foes Over Debt: Gunfight Leaves Both Injured, Both Had Guns and Refused to Yield, Gunshot Wounds to Arms and Chest, Fortunately Not Serious

A shooting occurred at the Yuelai Apartment in Run Kang New Village, Jing'an Temple Road, in the Public Concession at 5:40 PM yesterday. As a result, both parties were injured, fortunately, only slightly. The details are chronicled below.

**Originally Good Friends**

In Room 293 of the Yuelai Apartment in Run Kang New Village, Lane 591 Jing'an Temple Road, resided Wu Heyue, 26 years old, from Wuxi, who lived at 579 Wuding Road. He worked at the Zhaochang Iron Factory. He had a friend named Wang Zhentingzhu, 37 years old, residing at 49 Avenue Muntigny in the French Concession. They were close friends, like brothers.

**Friends Turn Foes Over Debt**

Wang, due to unemployment, felt economically strained. He borrowed 600 national currency from Wu. Last month, when Wu demanded repayment, Wang issued a bad check from the China Industrial Bank as a temporary measure. Wu was unable to cash the check upon maturity and confronted Wang, who avoided meeting him. At 9:40 PM yesterday, Wu learned that Wang was at the above location and drove there.

**Gunfight Ensues**

Wu went to Room 293 of the apartment to confront Wang. They disagreed and resorted to violence. Both sides produced their own guns and exchanged gunfire. A bullet hit Wu's right arm, grazed his chest, and penetrated his left elbow. Wang was also hit in the right leg, bleeding profusely. Fortunately, none of the injuries were serious. Afterward, the apartment reported the incident to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched to the scene, and the firearms were confiscated and taken back to the police station for safekeeping. Ambulances were quickly summoned to take the two injured men to Baolong Hospital for treatment.

### Kidnapping of Hu Qingchen, Robbery of Chinese Constable's Gun, Notorious Bandit Fan Jinbiao Yesterday Escorted to Court for Questioning, Fan Pleads Guilty to Both Cases

Chinese and foreign detectives from the Xinzha Police Station in the Public Concession previously apprehended a notorious bandit named Fan Jinbiao from Jiangbei. He was transferred to the Chief Inspector's Office for investigation. As a result of the investigation, Fan confessed to committing a kidnapping and a robbery. (1) Hu Qingchen, manager of the Shanghai Silver Company at 327 Jiangxi Road, resided at Lane 608, No. 60 Yuyuan Road.

**Wealthy Family**

His male servant, Zhu Yizhong, had been in contact with the bandit gang. Zhu initiated the plot and gathered several kidnappers. On November 23rd of last year, at 9:00 AM, they went to Hu's residence and kidnapped him. After several negotiations, Hu was released for a ransom of 120,000 yuan. Fan also participated in this case. (2) On October 22nd of last year, at 8:20 AM, Fan and his accomplices passed by a small hotel at 408 Yidingpan Road and saw two Chinese constables from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, No. 1305 and No. 1320.

**Having a Snack Inside**

They entered the hotel and, through intimidation, robbed the two Chinese constables of their two official pistols and 24 bullets. Yesterday morning, this case was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated that the plaintiff in the kidnapping case, Hu Qingchen, claimed to have left Shanghai and was therefore unable to be summoned to court. When questioned, Fan confessed to the crimes. Judge Chuan Lin reviewed the confession and ordered a postponement for further questioning in one week.

### Venerable Rongzeng Lama Goes to Hong Kong

The Tibetan Tantric Vajra Master Rongzeng Khenpo, by order of the former Panchen Lama and at the invitation of Duan Zhichuan, Qu Wenliu, and others, has been promoting Tibetan Buddhism and translating scriptures in Shanghai, remaining aloof from worldly affairs. Recently, disciples of Tantric Buddhism in Hong Kong have repeatedly requested him to travel south to offer guidance and preside over Dharma assemblies and consecration ceremonies for bronze Buddha statues. He has been delaying his departure. However, due to the depressing climate in Shanghai and to avoid the noise and dust, as well as to comply with the request of his Hong Kong disciples, he left for Hong Kong the day before yesterday. It is expected that he will be delayed there for a considerable period of time.

Children's Weekly

### Never Cease Studying

— Yang Chunlv

Dear children! Have you heard the story of "The Tortoise and the Hare"? The simple story is this: One day, the tortoise and the hare had a race. Although the tortoise walked slowly, it climbed diligently step by step, never giving up. The hare ran very fast at first, but it fell asleep halfway, ending up behind the tortoise.

Our pursuit of knowledge is like a race; we cannot stop for even a moment. If there is any interruption, not only will our studies not progress, but we will also regress due to forgetting. As the ancients said, "Studying is like sailing against the current; if you do not advance, you will fall behind." This is truly a profound saying.

Now that summer vacation has begun, children, you must feel very happy to be freed from the strict school life, right? However, the pursuit of knowledge cannot be interrupted. The weather is very hot during the summer vacation, and it is not advisable to use too much brainpower, but naturally, we should not let the time go to waste. In the morning, the weather is relatively cool, which is the perfect time to study. In addition to reviewing lessons, reading some valuable books and newspapers can increase your knowledge. Also, writing and keeping a diary should not be missed for a single day. The vacation assignments prescribed by the school should be done daily. If you feel too lonely working alone, then invite a few like-minded friends to organize a "Summer Reading Group" to learn from and encourage each other. The benefits you gain will naturally be many!

Children! I hope that during this summer vacation, you will not be intimidated by the heat, nor tempted by entertainment, but will still work hard to pursue knowledge, not interrupt it even slightly, and continue to make progress!

### Life is a Road

— Xin Gao

It was a summer afternoon. After Joan and Wayne finished eating, they had nothing to do, so they planned to go play in the nearby forest. It was a very large forest, with tall trees, red flowers, and green grass. There were also little birds flying around, singing happy songs. The beautiful scenery captivated these two children. Not until the stars appeared in the sky did they realize that it was getting late and that it was time to go home. But they had long forgotten the road they had taken to get in.

"Let's hurry up and run. Mom must be anxiously waiting at home!" Wayne said to Joan.

"But where's the road? This place is so big, there are so many small paths. Which path should we take to get out?" Joan was at a loss.

They could only grope around in the dark, trying each path, but all were failures. They were still in the forest, no matter where they went. There was one path that they wholeheartedly believed could lead them out, but although it led them out of the forest, a large swamp blocked their way.

Later, their mom ran out and brought them out. "Children, I've been waiting for you for so long!" she said to them. "The so-called life is also like this. No matter where you go, you should always carry a guide. Then you won't get lost. There are often many seemingly spacious roads in the world that will give you all sorts of fascinating pleasures, but they are actually dead ends that lead to corruption."

Children, what is the guide for life? Isn't it to read more and study more?

### Top Student

— Zhang Mengzhao

Praised by neighbors, delighted by parents, but absolutely must not be complacent.

When schools hold summer vacation closing ceremonies, what children are eager to know and anticipate is their overall average grade and their ranking on the list. This is because it's a thermometer of their usual hard work and a comprehensive test of their academic performance.

My son, Xixian, has been studying at the private Ziqiang Elementary School for years. He is currently in the fifth grade, class A, and will be entering the sixth grade next semester. He usually relies on his natural intelligence and is not willing to study diligently. I am deeply concerned that he is too clever for his own good at such a young age (he is twelve years old this year and lost a year of schooling during the Shanghai battle). Therefore, we constantly use both kindness and strictness to supervise him, urging him to learn and never be lazy. He is obedient and focused, so in every school exam, he is ranked second or third, never falling behind. This time, he again achieved "Five As" and "First Place," receiving a "scholarship voucher" from Mr. Shen Erke, the principal of Ziqiang School. The voucher stated: (1) This voucher is only awarded to the top three students in each grade. (2) Holders of this voucher can attend this school's current summer school session, exempt from tuition and book fees. (3) This voucher cannot be used as a substitute. (4) If the holder does not attend summer school, it cannot be used for other purposes, etc. We decided to have him attend summer school for further studies. He is temporarily praised by neighbors and delighted by us, but as parents, we must warn him against complacency. He must strive harder, be more self-motivated, and work hard in his studies. We hope that children who achieve "First Place" will also avoid "complacency."

### The World's First Mosquito Eradication Campaign

— Zhang Zhaolin

Dear children, you probably all know about world geography. In the Americas, there is the Panama Canal, connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, which can be said to be the largest canal in the world today.

This canal was originally managed by a Frenchman named Li Sai Pu. Because the Panama area had a very severe yellow fever, killing tens of thousands of workers every year, everyone was afraid of dying and unwilling to work. Li Sai Pu had no choice but to stop the canal construction.

Later, an American doctor stationed in Cuba, named Dr. Gorgas, studied the source of yellow fever and learned that it was transmitted by mosquitoes native to Central America. The mosquito sucks the blood of a person with yellow fever, and the germs follow the blood sucked, mixing into the mosquito's mouth. When it bites a healthy person, it mixes the germs into that person's blood, and thus yellow fever is transmitted to that person. In 1904, Dr. Gorgas went to the canal area and distributed many technical staff to carry out mosquito eradication work in the two major areas from the Panama Canal to Colón. He cleaned ditches, filled small puddles and ponds, sprayed kerosene inside, covered drinking water, and completely isolated and treated people who had already contracted yellow fever to prevent mosquitoes from sucking the germs again. In places with more mosquitoes, sulfur was burned to fumigate and kill them...etc. After exactly one year, by December 1905, the mosquitoes were eradicated.

This campaign consumed a total of 200,000 pounds of insecticide and 400,000 pounds of sulfur, which can truly be regarded as the world's first large-scale mosquito eradication campaign!

After the mosquitoes were eradicated, yellow fever no longer occurred, and the Americans began to dig through the Panama Canal.

### The Frog's Tongue

— Guan Qun

Hui'er came back from school and saw a frog on the bank of a field, sticking out its tongue to catch small insects. He squatted down, caught the frog, and put it in his clothes.

When Hui'er returned home, he took the frog out and looked at it carefully. After a while, he opened its mouth to look at its tongue, but its tongue suddenly disappeared.

Hui'er felt very strange and asked his sister, "Where did the frog's tongue go?" His sister said, "I think frogs probably don't have tongues." Hui'er quickly said, "When I didn't catch it, I clearly saw it sticking out its tongue to catch small insects. How can you say it doesn't have a tongue?" His sister said, "Then, I don't know. Go ask Dad."

Hui'er ran to ask his father. His father said, "Why did you think of asking me this?" Hui'er said, "When I didn't catch it, I saw it sticking out its tongue to catch small insects. Now, when I open its mouth to look at its tongue, the tongue suddenly disappears. Isn't this a strange thing? So I asked my sister, and she didn't know, so I came to ask you!" His father said, "You are really observant, and I am very happy for you! Do you want to understand the structure of a frog's tongue? Wait a moment! I will get a book about frogs to show you." Hui'er was very happy to hear his father praise him, and his interest in studying the frog's tongue became even stronger.

After a while, his father brought a book and pointed to the section about frogs, saying to Hui'er, "Because its tongue root is connected to the lower jaw, and the tip of its tongue faces inward, you can't see the tongue when you open its mouth." Hui'er said, "Dad! What you said is wrong. You said the tip of its tongue faces inward, so how can the tip of its tongue extend outside the mouth?" His father smiled and said, "Precisely because the tip of its tongue faces inward, it can be turned outward and extended." Hui'er said, "Then, how can it catch the flying insects firmly?" His father said, "Because there is a layer of mucus on its tongue. When mosquitoes or moths fly by, it can stick them with a roll of its tongue and swallow them into its stomach." Hui'er understood and said, "Oh! That's how it is."

### Norma Shearer Hates Solitary Life

— Qing Hui

Speaking of Norma Shearer, everyone knows that she is the widow of former MGM manager Irving Thalberg. They married in 1928 and had a son and a daughter. But good times didn't last long. Before long, Thalberg abandoned his beautiful wife and passed away, and this unparalleled artist fell into the abyss of darkness. This sudden trauma and the sorrow of death forced her to temporarily leave the screen until 1938, when she returned to the silver screen, awakening her black and gray dreams. Recently, she met George Raft, and the extinguished fire of love rekindled. Is she really going to remarry? Indeed, here is her confession as proof:

"What surprises me the most is that people seem to care about me. Now I have a chance to pour out all the sorrows hidden in my heart," said Norma.

"The first thing I should declare is that I think solitary life is wrong, fundamentally wrong, and harmful to health, especially for someone in my profession. When filming, at home, everywhere, I am alone, so my personality gradually becomes special, very selfish and strange. Recently, I feel that I am extremely easy to get angry. When I can't find hand sanitizer or the shoes I usually wear, I scold people, and even feel that the world is cold and not surrounded by sunshine. Only in all dark places does my insignificant self exist." Norma seemed very sad and paused for a long time before continuing:

"In my house, I can eat whatever I want, and no one interferes or criticizes me. I can go out whenever I want, and I can go home whenever I want, and I never have to say 'Goodbye!' or have anyone tell me to come back early. If I lie in bed and read novels all night without sleeping, no one will stop me or tell me that I shouldn't. Really! I am too free. But, God! I hate myself. Why do I have to live alone and lonely in this vast universe?"

"Also, many reports in newspapers and magazines have reported about my friendship with Raft. I also admit that this is not entirely false. My children respect him, and we do have a good friendship, but I still need to consider marriage carefully. Of course, I am willing to remarry, because of the children and for my own sake, I do need a husband to help and comfort me again. I believe a widow should remarry, especially a passionate woman."

As she spoke, her pair of black eyes sparkled as if she were about to cry. That delicate face, jet-black hair, and bright red lips, paired with black velvet trousers and a loose short jacket in alternating golden yellow and tender green colors, were indeed beautiful and charming. You might ask, "Why would such a lovely woman live a solitary life?"

### Evaluation of "Long, Long Ago"

— Sha Fei

I have read Alexandre Dumas fils' "La Dame aux Camélias" more than ten times, and each time it brings me to tears. I let emotion carve through pieces of wounds. This is the depth to which the article moves people.

"Long, Long Ago" is adapted from the story of "La Dame aux Camélias." Some of the plots inside are roughly the same. The only differences are that one has a Western background and the other has local scenery. Also, in terms of consciousness, one is a powerful satire against feudalism, and the other instills a correct sense of patriotism.

The entire play has five acts. The first two acts are relatively calm and dull, and it seems that the actors only have dead bodies as a backdrop, without the expression of living souls. From the third act onwards, it is directly surrounded by a tense atmosphere.

Vera plays the Camellia Lady, and Qin Wei plays Hu Zhisheng. Their tit-for-tat confrontation in the third act is one of the best scenes in the entire play. Hu Zhisheng forced her sentence by sentence to leave his son, to make her know that the greatest love does not belong to private possession, and to encourage or rather, to agitate Hu Yamin to serve the country. In short, it is to make her bravely sacrifice everything. The external and internal pain conveyed by the Camellia Lady during this period concerns the lifeblood of the entire play; Vera plays it very well, her face changes constantly, her tone changes from time to time, and every move can grasp the audience's heart.

In the fourth act, the Camellia Lady and Hu Yamin have a reunion, and Jin Baiwan comes with them. Thus began the dueling dialogue.

Qiao Qi, who plays Hu Yamin, ridiculed Jin Baiwan (played by Shao Fan) on the one hand, and scolded the Camellia Lady on the other, with every word biting and every sentence powerful. It is a pity that Shao Fan's Jin Baiwan's expression and movements are a bit stiff, and it seems that it is not stimulating enough.

The fifth act is "Death Separation."

The Camellia Lady's words to Hu Yamin on her deathbed were: "I hope you will cherish yourself for the country!" In terms of actors, in addition to these important roles, others such as Lu Shan's Mrs. Lü, Sun Qi Ying's Fan Shaofu, Li Yi's Cheng Guoqing, Xia Wang's Qian Ailan, Bi Sheng's Guo Shidong, Qiu Zhi's Tang Rensui, and Lin Na's Lingli, can all be competent.

Chapter 12 As Expected, Ning Wu Can't Be Helped

Zhou Yuji saw that the morale was still good and felt a little relieved, so he went to inspect the city walls. He ordered the soldiers to repair the loopholes in several places and guard them carefully. There were several earthen cannons on the pass. Zhou Yuji selected more than a dozen gunners, prepared ammunition, so that they could bombard the bandits in an emergency. The next day, the vanguard of the rebels arrived. Two bandit generals challenged the defenders at the pass. Zhou Yuji wanted to meet the enemy himself, but Wang Weiguo was willing to do it for him. Zhou Yuji then ordered Xu Jing to guard the formation and dispatched four hundred men to kill out of the pass. Wang Weiguo wielded two copper hammers, riding a tall horse, and fought with the two bandits. Before long, one hammer hit a bandit's head, and his brains burst and he died. A bandit turned his horse to escape, but Wang Weiguo chased after him quickly, and another hammer swept across, hitting the bandit general's back, and he fell off his horse. Wang Weiguo killed two bandits in a row, and chased after them on horseback. Xu Jing, fearing that he would lose, also killed after him. The bandit soldiers were defeated and fled. The two men withdrew their troops into the city, and Zhou Yuji offered wine to comfort them. He still ordered his subordinates to guard the pass strictly, and a large force of rebels would surely arrive. Sure enough, when the setting sun hung over the mountains, the dust outside the pass covered the sky, and the sound of the Jia horn filled the ears. Li Zicheng had led a large force of rebels to attack Ningwu Pass. They set up five large camps in a plum blossom formation under the pass, and many small camps were set up on both sides. Looking over, the flags fluttered in the wind, circling like earthworms, filled with murderous intent, and the momentum was vast. But in the blink of an eye, it was evening, and there was no sign of the rebels attacking. Zhou Yuji, having learned a lesson in Daizhou, ordered his subordinates to be careful and prepared. He himself did not rest for a moment on the city wall. The rebel army was quiet and motionless. The next morning, at dawn, the shouts outside the pass shook the sky, and people gathered like ants. The rebels attacked Ningwu Pass in one go, shooting rockets into the city. In an instant, the dilapidated building caught fire and burned. Zhou Yuji hurriedly directed the soldiers to extinguish the fire as soon as possible. He then ordered the gunners to fire all the earthen cannons at once. The sound of the cannons was deafening, hitting down on the pass. Sparks exploded, and smoke filled the air. Countless rebels died in the artillery fire, and the offensive was greatly reduced. (108)
