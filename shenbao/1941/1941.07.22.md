### The Eastern Front Enters Its Fifth Week: Two German Heavy Artillery Battalions Annihilated; Soviet Forces Engage in Fierce Rearguard Action on Central Front; Moscow Communiqué Cheerfully States No Change on Front

United Press, Moscow, 21st – Yesterday, the battle entered its fifth week. German and Soviet tanks and large armored units, aided by a substantial number of infantry, engaged in fierce fighting throughout the day across four sectors in the west.

TASS, Moscow, 21st – On the night of the 20th and the morning of the 21st, intense fighting continued in the areas of Polotsk, Nevel, Smolensk, and Novogrudok. There were no changes in other sectors. On the 25th, the Air Force shot down 31 enemy aircraft, while we lost 6.

TASS, Moscow, 21st – The Soviet Information Bureau announced in its battle report for the night of the 20th that partisan warfare was proceeding smoothly in the enemy rear. Partisan detachments inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. Our Air Force, in unfavorable flying conditions, continued to bomb enemy motorized columns, mechanized units, and airfields. According to preliminary statistics, on the morning of the 20th, a total of 25 enemy aircraft were shot down. In the Baltic Sea, our Air Force sank one enemy destroyer.

TASS, Moscow, 20th – The Soviet Information Bureau announced in its battle report for the early morning of the 20th that our Air Force continued to bomb enemy tanks and motorized columns. It was previously reported that 18 enemy aircraft were destroyed by our Air Force in the air and on the ground on the 18th. According to current accurate statistics, a total of 71 enemy aircraft have been destroyed.

TASS, Moscow, 21st – Our patrol reports that the enemy is concentrating a large force in a certain area in preparation for an offensive. Upon receiving the report, Major General Goyeninov's unit, taking the enemy by surprise, suddenly surrounded a Fascist battalion and opened fire. The battle lasted for several hours. Our Red Army soldiers destroyed 300 enemy trucks and two German heavy artillery battalions. The spoils of war included 30 trucks, countless horses, and a large amount of ammunition. Many prisoners were also taken.

Haitong News Agency, German Headquarters, 21st – This afternoon's German military communiqué stated that German, Romanian, and Hungarian allied forces in the southern sector of the Eastern Front are continuing to pursue the enemy. Battles elsewhere are also favorable to Germany. Many enemy troops are surrounded, and many more are being annihilated.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 21st – It is reported today that, after weeks of stalemate between German and Soviet forces in the central sector of the Eastern Front, a Soviet division in that area was completely annihilated by German forces yesterday.

Havas News Agency, Rome, 20th – "Il Messaggero" reports that the participants in the German-Soviet war total 9 million army personnel, 20,000 tanks, 40,000 trucks, 20,000 aircraft, and 200,000 machine guns. The Red Army is currently making unprecedented efforts, but in terms of the overall strategic situation, the Red Army's position is quite precarious. General Voroshilov has mobilized a million troops to defend Leningrad. However, all transportation networks along the Soviet border have been destroyed by the German Air Force. In recent days, the Soviet Union has mobilized large numbers of reserve troops, continuously sending them to the front lines as reinforcements to stop the German advance.

Continuous Fierce Battles in Various Areas; German Progress Slow

Reuters, London, 21st – Recent Soviet communiqués continue to state that there are no significant changes in any area of the front lines. Today's German news, however, quoted a Berlin military spokesperson as saying that Soviet forces are currently retreating along the entire line from Leningrad to the Black Sea. The main force of Soviet troops retreating from Smolensk has been repeatedly attacked by German forces and has no opportunity to organize resistance. The Soviet communiqué did not mention this general retreat. Although the German High Command stated that the fighting in the Smolensk area is continuing according to plan, sources here say that five days have passed since the Germans claimed to have occupied Smolensk, and the German advance has been slow and can hardly be described as a blitzkrieg. Recent Soviet communiqués state that fierce fighting continued on Sunday in the areas of Biskov, Bobruisk, Nevel, Smolensk, and Novogrudok, and that there were no significant changes on the front lines. Soviet partisans have been quite successful in operating behind German lines, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The Soviet Air Force, braving unfavorable weather, continued its attacks to destroy enemy mechanized units and enemy aircraft. According to still incomplete reports, on the morning of July 20th, 25 enemy aircraft were destroyed in aerial combat and on airfields. In the Baltic Sea, the Soviet Air Force sank one enemy torpedo boat. Last night, Moscow Radio announced that Stalin had been appointed Chairman of the State Defense Committee, which was warmly welcomed by the Soviet people. It is also reported that fierce fighting is taking place east of the Dniester River. Last Saturday and Sunday, the Germans claimed that German forces had forcibly crossed the river from Bessarabia. The Italian official news agency recently reported that German and Romanian troops, starting from bases on the west bank of the Dniester River, have reached the fortresses of the Stalin Line. These fortresses are made of reinforced concrete and steel, guarded by cannons of various calibers, and garrisoned by some of the best Soviet troops. As of last night, German and Romanian troops had breached the line in a certain area. Furthermore, according to the Italian news agency's Berlin report, after the Soviet troops retreated from the Soviet-Finnish border, large fires broke out in the forests north of Lake Ladoga on the border, and villages and towns were reduced to ashes. Vichy News Agency reported news from a Swiss capital newspaper, stating that the solidity of Leningrad's defense system is rarely seen globally. Its surrounding fortress area extends west to the Neva River, Lake Peipus, and the Velikaya River, east to Valdai Hills, and north to Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of Finland. The fortified zone along the Gulf of Finland is fifty miles deep, and these fortifications have recently been strengthened. The fortress area can accommodate 5,000 aircraft.

Reuters, London, 21st – Fierce fighting continued yesterday in the main areas of the German advance towards Leningrad, Moscow, and Kyiv. Neither Moscow nor Berlin official communiqués mentioned any new place names. Yesterday, the Germans claimed victories on the Finnish and Bessarabian fronts, and stated that the fighting in the Smolensk "wedge"-shaped battlefield was proceeding according to plan. According to a Berlin dispatch in the Basler Nachrichten, Nazi officials believe that the time to threaten Moscow is not yet ripe, as the German objective is to completely destroy the Soviet forces, not to focus on place names. The dispatch stated that this attitude of German officials is widely regarded as an indication that the German advance has slowed.

Soviet Forces Repulse German Offensive, Maintaining Straight Front Line

Central News Agency, London, 21st – It has been learned that the hard-fighting Soviet Red Army repulsed a fierce German offensive at the end of last week, the fourth week since the start of the war. As a result, the intensity and scope of the fighting have greatly increased. At present, the Soviet Union appears to be maintaining a straight front line, albeit one that has been pierced in places, along the entire line from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea. The full force of the German army is obviously attacking along the tip of a salient, one advancing directly along the Moscow highway from Smolensk, and the other advancing from Biskov. The Soviet army is clearly preparing to retreat in an orderly fashion, while maintaining a stubborn front line. It can generally prevent the Germans from suddenly breaking through any gaps or implementing encirclement strategies, as they did in Poland and France. It is now believed that Marshal Timoshenko's central army is conducting a fierce rearguard action, not only to defend Moscow, but also to mobilize reserve forces to counterattack the German army. Rumors that the German army has cut off the Red Army's northern and southern lines of communication, and that it has driven a pointed wedge into the middle, have not been confirmed.

United Press, Berlin, 21st – Authoritative sources said last night that the German forces on the Eastern Front are attacking the rearguard units of the retreating Soviet forces, inflicting heavy casualties on the Soviets in both land and air battles. It is heard that the German forces are thwarting the Soviet Union's attempt to establish a new defense line west of Moscow. The Nazi armored units in that area are advancing using modern highways leading to Moscow from the Smolensk area. Sources in that area said that the German forces are also clearing pocket-shaped defense lines behind the main battle lines. It is reported that the German forces suffered extremely heavy losses during the mopping-up operations because of the strong resistance of the Soviet forces.

### Nazi Morale on the Verge of Collapse

United Press, Montreal, 21st – Strasser, a former Nazi leader who now calls himself the leader of Free Germany, declared last night that the internal morale of the Nazis, already weak, is about to collapse. The new British psychological warfare against Germany will be a powerful weapon to cause this Nazi morale to collapse. He said that this offensive, including increased air raids on Germany, will require considerable time to undermine German morale, but it will succeed. He said that this attack on German morale, this work of destruction, will have considerable effect, or may take some time, but it will succeed. He warned that if Germany defeats the Soviet Union, it will be very serious for the Allied countries, and predicted that after Hitler succeeds on the Eastern Front, he will then propose peace and restoration of their national freedom to Belgium, the Netherlands, and France to create a neutral front against England. He pointed out that this plan would make the arguments of those in the United States who advocate isolationism even more plausible.

### German Soldiers Flee in Panic Under Red Army Bayonet Charge

TASS, Moscow, 21st – Major General Penikhov wrote in Red Star that German infantry rarely excel in bayonet charges. They are accustomed to advancing behind tanks and are not good at acting alone. Whenever the Fascists engage the Russian bayonet troops, they either flee in panic or surrender. They can hide in trenches to avoid guns and cannons, but they cannot escape under the bayonet. A certain army major was ordered to defeat a German detachment occupying a certain area. This detachment had a large number of tanks and motorized infantry. Initially, the enemy infantry advanced under the cover of tanks, but when the Red Army rushed forward to carry out a bayonet charge, the Germans could not cope. They mostly failed to get on their vehicles and fled in droves. The drivers of the military vehicles fled in haste, even forgetting the soldiers behind them. Some soldiers hid in the wheat fields, but were eventually killed by bayonets. Not long ago, we engaged the enemy in close combat at a certain densely populated point. The panicked German soldiers scattered in all directions, some climbing onto rooftops, some hiding in trenches. Within half an hour, the enemy detachment had been defeated, while we suffered only minor injuries. A prisoner named Brod said, "The Russian bayonet is lethal. We only understood what real war is like in Russia." Whenever the Fascists engage the Russians in bayonet combat, corpses are scattered everywhere. In future battles, the Russian bayonet troops will defeat the enemy with even greater force.

### Rumor That Aged German Generals Oppose Invasion of Soviet Union

TASS, Bear City, 21st – Military sources here say that due to the unsuccessful conduct of the war on the Eastern Front, the first strong friction in several years has occurred among German generals. The current military operations are being conducted solely by Hitler's military allies. Old and experienced generals are fiercely opposed to Hitler's style of command. On the eve of Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, German generals convened a meeting. Details about the meeting have recently been leaked. It is said that there were extremely conflicting opinions at the meeting. Those who advocated the "blitzkrieg strategy," Riesterd, Goldmann, and Li Qunuoyi, argued that the Eastern Front campaign would inevitably turn into a protracted war of attrition, which would inevitably lead to Germany's collapse. This was said by experts in German tanks and armored vehicles. Others who opposed Hitler's adventurous actions included Goering, Mier Qu, and General of the Army Thomas, director of the military economy of the Supreme Command. Nevertheless, Hitler signed the order to advance on June 21. After the invasion began, the opposing generals immediately suffered retaliation. Goering was returned from aerial combat on the Eastern Front, and Li Qunuoyi's position was replaced by Shi Qiumitte. He was transferred to a secondary front. Riesterd, Sedornergier, and Fulgenhorst were all monitored by Hitler's secret agents. Several generals were sent back. Rumors have it that several senior generals have committed suicide.

### Danish Volunteers Arrive in Germany

Haitong News Agency, Hamburg, 21st – The first contingent of Danish volunteers sent to the Eastern Front, the "Danish Corps," arrived here yesterday morning. The contingent was led by a police brass band and a storm troop unit of the Hamburg City Police. The entire contingent marched through the city streets toward the barracks. Many onlookers lined the streets and cheered continuously.

### Finnish Troops Attempt Landing; One Unit Annihilated

TASS, Moscow, 21st – A detachment of Finnish White Guards attempted to land behind our army's lines. Machine gun detachment commander Leishmikoff waited until the enemy ships approached the shore and opened fire fiercely. Six ships carrying Finnish White Guards were destroyed, and the rest fled.

Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 21st – The official announcement yesterday stated that enemy aircraft attacked the cities of Mitsinan and Kio on Saturday, causing little damage, and dropped many naval mines around the outer islands in the Gulf of Finland. During the air battle near Keisalai in the vicinity of Lake Ladoga on Saturday, three enemy warplanes were shot down by our planes, and another six were shot down by anti-aircraft guns.

### Chinese Troops Recapture Guangji in Eastern Hubei; Japanese Troops at Xiyangsha on the Xiang River Suffer Heavy Losses; Chinese Troops Launch Successful Offensive in Western Zhongtiao Mountains

Chongqing – It is now reported that Chinese troops are very active in the western part of the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi. Although the main force of the Chinese army has withdrawn to other positions after the recent Japanese offensive in the Zhongtiao Mountains, according to the latest war news from southern Shanxi from the Chinese side, the Chinese army has now recaptured Yongji, Ruicheng, Yuxiang, and Jiexian in the western part of the Zhongtiao Mountains. Since July 8, the Japanese artillery units on the north bank of the Yellow River have been shelling the Chinese army positions near Shanxian on the south bank in an attempt to disrupt traffic on the Longhai Railway. The Chinese artillery units on the south bank returned fire, inflicting losses on the Japanese army. According to Chinese sources in Yichang, Guangji on the north bank of the Yangtze River in eastern Hubei, which was captured by the Japanese army on July 11, has now been recaptured by the Chinese army. When the Japanese army attacked on the previous day, the Chinese army retreated to the mountains northwest of the city, and then, when reinforcements arrived, the Chinese army counterattacked and recaptured it. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)

Chongqing – Military News: (1) In the Ruicheng area, more than a thousand Japanese troops wreaked havoc in the northwest of the city. On the 16th and 17th, a unit of the Chinese 104th Division, together with local militias, ambushed the Japanese troops in segments in the vicinity of Lijiami, Dawangzhuang, and Zhangcun. Chinese artillery also provided fire support. In total, two Japanese officers and more than 300 soldiers were killed or wounded, and dozens of mules were killed. (2) In the area opposite Bailangdu in the southwest of Yuanqu, Japanese troops fired more than a hundred shells at the south bank on the 16th. Fortunately, the Chinese had made preparations and suffered no damage. Chinese artillery returned fire, hitting the Japanese positions and inflicting some damage on the Japanese. (3) The thousand or so Japanese troops who fought against the Chinese near Dongzhang in western Fuqing suffered heavy casualties. On the 19th, the Chinese and Japanese were still engaged in fierce fighting. (Dispatch on the 21st)

Changde – A unit of the Chinese army north of the Yangtze River searched for Japanese soldiers along the west bank of the Xiang River on the afternoon of the 16th and advanced to the vicinity of Wangjiachang, about ten miles south of Shayang. They spotted seven trucks loaded with Japanese soldiers coming from Shayang. They immediately hid in the area. When the trucks drove close, they suddenly launched an attack. The Japanese soldiers also returned fire at the Chinese army from the trucks with machine guns and grenades. At this time, four Japanese aircraft flew in to provide support. The officers and soldiers of the entire company of the Chinese army showed great courage and charged forward, throwing hand grenades at the trucks, eventually destroying several Japanese trucks and killing nearly a hundred Japanese soldiers. Only a few Chinese soldiers were wounded. After the unit fiercely attacked the Japanese army, they returned to their unit safely. In the afternoon of the same day, another unit of Japanese infantry and cavalry, with nine trucks and under the cover of three Japanese aircraft, started from Shayang and, when they arrived at the three-way intersection near Zushidian, were also ambushed by a unit of the Chinese army, suffering even heavier casualties.

### Moscow Not Subjected to Air Raids

Reuters, Moscow, 20th – The Soviet capital has not yet encountered air raids. The blackout regulations have become stricter than before. When alarms are sounded, traffic is completely suspended, and people all enter air-raid shelters. On the surface, Moscow is still as usual. Reports also state that Leningrad is the same. Shops in the city are open as usual, and factory workers are stepping up production. Anti-Hitler cartoons, posters, and oil paintings are pasted all along Kuznetzky Most Avenue, often with doggerel attached. One painting depicts Teutonic knights in armor drowning near Leningrad in 1241. There are also many pictures depicting the suffering of people in countries oppressed by Hitler and the secret resistance work carried out by forced nations.

Editorial

### The Preliminary Skirmish in the Struggle for Economic Freedom

The world powers each have their own territories, races, political systems, and other differing factors, and each raise their own flags. However, when it comes to the foundation upon which they establish their nations and the goals of their governance, whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, all regard the means of resolving the people's livelihood as the ultimate aim. What is called national planning and state policy is, in essence, referring to the people's livelihood. The utopias of the ancient philosophers Aristotle and Plato, and the theories of governance of Confucius and Mencius, all take the pursuit of economic freedom for all the people as the purpose of establishing a nation. The economy is the lifeblood of the factors that establish a nation, and it can indeed stand tall above politics. The reason why politics seeks to control the economy is mostly a measure of correction, which is very clear. The economy as a necessary element for establishing a nation has never been as clear as it is today. This is why the powers are willing to abandon all friendship and credit, and do not hesitate to exhaust their military power to achieve it.

Today's weapon wars will inevitably come to an end; and fierce economic wars will follow. Therefore, while countries on the front lines do not hesitate to take a desperate gamble and implement cruel means of destruction, behind the lines, they are all plotting against each other, actively preparing to thoroughly transform the economic organization of the future, in order to strengthen their economic power and prepare for future confrontation with other countries. Moreover, the people of various countries are dissatisfied with their national economic organizations and have expressed their grievances. They eagerly hope to realize a superior life after the war. If those who lead the people cannot fulfill their promises and thoroughly improve the people's livelihood, then social disputes within the country will have the danger of overflowing like a flood.

Even with the perfect economic development of the United Kingdom, it is still subject to severe criticism from its people. One can imagine the current situation of countries without economic plans and those that are backward. Therefore, taking the United Kingdom as an example, the most important and obvious points that its people hope for are highlighted as a reference for us.

According to the British system, equal opportunities in life, as well as all political and economic rights, are to be enjoyed by all citizens. When they are old or unemployed and unable to work, the government provides pensions and relief funds to maintain their lives. Such complete facilities, when compared to our country's customs, are the ultimate in what is called the way of nurturing life and providing for death. Who would have known that the British people's comments on the corruption of their motherland's system are greatly contrary to our ordinary psychology, which is incredible. According to the thinking of the generally progressive British people, today's Britain has not yet realized true equal opportunity, nor is it a true democratic government. Some even point to it as a centralized government with a changed face. The very existence of relief funds and other facilities is proof of the flaws in the British economic organization. The intention here is that a perfect organization must enable everyone to support themselves without having to rely on government relief. Countries like the Soviet Union and Germany often boast that they have no unemployed people and criticize the alarming number of unemployed people in the United States and Britain, which is how they distinguish between the good and bad of their systems. As for today's low prices in the United Kingdom (this was discussed in this newspaper's editorial on the 15th of this month, "General Discussion on People's Livelihood and the Serious Key to Prices"), the British are still not satisfied, and they all advocate for universal and effective suppression of prices.

The British firmly believe that the people are the foundation of the nation. Whether in peacetime or wartime, the greatest sacrifices are made by the majority of the people. As Federman said, "Everything comes from the people." Therefore, the prerequisite for the implementation of a democratic political system must first meet a social system of fair sacrifice, rather than the so-called system of seeking welfare for the majority of the people in the past. Even if the burden of sacrifice cannot be absolutely and fairly distributed to all the people, the greatest effort must be made to achieve an ideal system that is targeted at this goal. In short, due to the needs of the war, the government has already greatly changed the economic and social organization, and the people not only eagerly hope for a thorough transformation of the system after the war, but also demand the immediate realization of an ideal democratic facility during the war.

For example, there are several things that the United Kingdom urgently needs to implement at present. The unified distribution of daily necessities should not only be limited to essential foods, but also make rare and expensive items available for popular consumption, and should not be exclusively for the enjoyment of special classes. Although taxes have already been raised, there are still many people who enjoy luxurious lives. This should be corrected as soon as possible to ensure that no citizen enjoys extra food and service supplies. The country should immediately formulate a unified wage policy to remedy the current abnormal and divergent income. All industries requisitioned for military needs should not be given special consideration due to special relationships. All patented businesses that have a necessary relationship with public services must be purchased and operated by municipal authorities. All uncultivated land should be taken over by the central government and nationalized. If a store does not need to continue operating during the war and is closed, and the owner can take on a position related to national defense, then the government should compensate for the loss of business.

As for what the British people hope to achieve after the war, it is described in two sections below. Every citizen, regardless of gender, age, or status, should have access to sufficient food to maintain their highest level of health. Every child should have the opportunity to receive a full education, and poor and wealthy students should be in the same school, and there should be no separate schools for different classes. Regarding people's services, a Ministry of Social Affairs should be established to manage all social security services, including setting minimum wages, reorganizing social security insurance, and expanding the work of the subsidy service department, in order to seek appropriate work for the people. In order to promote the development of sports, government medical institutions must be committed to the widespread promotion of health, and must not be complacent with epidemic prevention work. Furthermore, in terms of land, agricultural land cultivation must be thoroughly reformed and utilized to ensure that there is no phenomenon of wasteland.

All ownership of land and real estate can only be regarded as a responsibility of trust, and must not be regarded as a tool for speculators. Therefore, with regard to reconstruction of towns and houses, etc., speculators must not be allowed to participate, and it must be implemented in accordance with an open plan. Furthermore, all production enterprises can no longer be allowed to fall into the hands of traditionalists. In order to realize this plan, investment must be controlled, not only investment in housing or other fixed assets, but also all circulating capital. If an individual is unwilling to invest in this way, then a social organization should come forward and take their place. Therefore, all securities issuance markets and bank operations, even issues such as profits and public reserve funds, must be strictly controlled. At the same time, a national investment company should be established to provide capital with reasonable interest rates and conditions for indirect or direct investment in all construction matters.

Based on the above, the scope of matters that should be promoted and reformed in the British economic organization is vast and boundless, and its implementation will inevitably seriously affect the rights of traditionalists. Fortunately, the elimination of class concepts and the cooperation of mutual understanding among various factions are all supreme gains of the war. Therefore, the British government has been able to realize various reforms. Judging by the rationality of the British people, there is no doubt that other reforms will also be realized in order. In short, the overall situation of the world and the organization of economic and social systems in various countries will inevitably undergo major reforms. If those in power want to stick to old ways and go against the tide, they will inevitably be eliminated by natural selection and competition. If they can meet the progress of the times and plan a fair adjustment of the overall organization, then they will surely be able to grasp the left coupon of victory. At this moment, the preliminary skirmish is flourishing. If those in power want to establish a national economic foundation and defend the front line of economic freedom, now is the time.

### US Administration Hopes for Peaceful Resolution of KMT-CPC Friction; US Military Aid to China Will Not Be Used in Chinese Civil War; Making KMT-CPC Reconciliation Lattimore's Important Mission

Washington: Administration officials said last night that the United States is trying to achieve peace between Chiang Kai-shek's central army and the Communist Party so that US military aid to China will not be used in the Chinese civil war. It is said that one of the important missions of Lattimore, the newly appointed American advisor to General Chiang Kai-shek, is to bring about peace in China. Lattimore has now arrived in Chongqing. Officials here are deeply concerned that the conflict between the KMT and the CPC will have a major impact on China's resistance. Reliable Far East sources believe that this conflict is not important, but only a small war of a local nature. These people also said that the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Germany and the conclusion of an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union may bring the KMT-CPC friction in China to an end. They also said that the Chinese Communist Party now recognizes that everything depends on whether the war against Germany is won, and everything else is secondary. They stated that the KMT and the CPC may soon reach an agreement on some special issues. The Foreign Policy Association recently published an important research report on the KMT-CPC dispute, stating that what worries the United States the most is that such conflicts, if continued, will jeopardize China's victory. The report continued that China's opportunities are greatly affected by such factional differences. Although China's national unity cause has been subjected to a terrible challenge, the situation is somewhat better because China's responsible leaders, whether from the Kuomintang or the Communist Party, now recognize that if they openly break down, there will be danger, and they are working hard to adjust all kinds of problems, even the most difficult ones. The report also said that at present, the people of the whole of China are unanimously heading towards resistance and construction, and will not stop until victory is achieved, and do not want to attach themselves to any party. This determination may be a factor that breaks through all obstacles and controls everything. Diplomats believe that this local incident may continue for a long time, because China has never been able to stabilize local separatist regimes, and political funds are mostly not provided by the central government, but are collected by each local official in the place he governs. This system inevitably leads to political friction, but judging from the current situation in China where the necessity of unity is felt, it may tend to disappear. (United Press Agency, 21st)

Original Text of Military Department's Telegram to Zhu De Expressing Gratitude

Chongqing: The Xinhua Daily News on the 20th published a debate by Mr. Zhou Enlai regarding the 18th Group Army's free actions in attacking friendly forces. The most important statement was that "The telegram of the 18th was published on the 19th, not only was Commander-in-Chief Zhu unable to reply, but I did not receive any prior notification, etc." In order to clarify the truth, the reporter visited the spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission, who informed him: "After the Shanxi incident occurred, this Commission sent two telegrams to Commander-in-Chief Zhu on June 27th and July 9th respectively, ordering him to stop. The telegrams of June 27th and July 5th to Commander-in-Chief Zhu were also copied to Mr. Zhou Enlai." How can it be said that no notification was received?" While saying this, the spokesperson showed the reporter the original text of the two telegrams, which are transcribed as follows: (Commander-in-Chief Zhu Yu Jie, Confidential, According to reports: (1) Bo Yibo's troops attacked the Ouyang Regiment of the Liu Division near Zhangshang (northwest of Tangcheng) at dawn on the 8th, and forced officers and soldiers to collect firearms, in large numbers. Another unit forcibly took away Sun Zengwen, the magistrate of Changzi County, and civil servants in Xinzhuang, Changzi County, on the morning of the 12th. (2) The Fifth Battalion of Liu Maogong's troops of your department stationed in Longdong Huan County has invaded the defense zone of the friendly army of Ranxia Yuwangpu. Please investigate and stop it as soon as possible, return the firearms of the Ouyang Regiment, release the Changzi County magistrate and county government personnel, and order the troops entering Yuwangpu to withdraw to their original station, so as to avoid conflict. Military Order Department Respectfully. (Commander-in-Chief Zhu Yu Jie, Confidential, According to reports, Lei Regiment and the Hu Regiment of the Dare-to-Die Corps of your group army are active south of Hongtun Road, causing misunderstandings with Wu Shimin's troops who are guerrillas in the Taiyue area. Please investigate and stop it immediately, and order them to withdraw to their original defense, so as to avoid disputes and help each other and unite against foreign enemies. I hope to reply, Military Order Department Respectfully. (Telegram of the 20th)

Dagong Bao Earnestly Advices the 18th Group Army

Chongqing: The Dagong Bao's editorial today, entitled "Earnestly Advicing the 18th Group Army," stated that it is a matter of course for the army to obey orders and abide by discipline. However, the 18th Group Army has repeatedly attacked friendly forces and seized political power. The central government has been tolerant and advised them, hoping that they would return to the norm. This is entirely out of the commander-in-chief's concern for unity. However, such unfortunate incidents continue to occur. In addition to hoping that the General Headquarters will continue to adopt a lenient attitude, we also hope that the 18th Group Army should know that after the Soviet-German war and the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, the interests of the two countries have become consistent. Therefore, there should be no more partisan disputes in China. It should also be known that Stalin and Molotov have repeatedly shouted "Defend the Motherland" in the face of a powerful enemy. Therefore, the CCP should fight for the motherland. Furthermore, after the Japanese army succeeded in the Zhongtiao Mountains, it turned to sweep away the troops of the Xiaoba Group Army. It can be seen that the Japanese army is accustomed to defeating them one by one. We must not be fooled. (Havas News Agency, 21st)

### District Chief of the Third District of Xiushui Commended

Changsha: Xiong Yangying, the district chief of the Third District of Xiushui, Jiangxi, has spared no effort in promoting wartime government orders, and has repeatedly dealt heavy blows to the Japanese army. The Japanese police captain of Baicha Street in the county, Tianchuan, deeply felt unable to cope and offered him a high position, trying to induce him to surrender. Xiong not only did not waver, but also wrote back to scold his recklessness, and strongly stated that the Chinese side has always treated Japanese soldiers who surrender with great kindness, advising him to return with his weapons. When this was refused, he drove his troops to launch a large-scale invasion. District Chief Xiong led his team to ambush at Jinfu Mountain and Fengyuan and other places, intercepting them. After four days of confrontation and five fierce battles, it was estimated that more than 50 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and several Japanese ships were sunk. The Japanese could not hold out and retreated. After receiving the report, the Party and Government Branch of this war zone believed that the district chief was loyal to the Party and loved the country, was not tempted by profit, and was able to take on great difficulties. Therefore, he was issued a commendation order and telegraphed to the Jiangxi Provincial Government to grant him a meritorious record or promotion to encourage him. (Telegram of the 21st)

### Reorganization of Hankou Navigation Administration Bureau Approved by the Executive Yuan; Renamed the Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau; in Charge of Navigation Administration on the Entire Yangtze River Line

Chongqing: The Hankou Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications was originally in charge of navigation administration in Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces. Since the outbreak of the war, the Shanghai and Tianjin Navigation Administration Bureaus have been abolished, and the river and sea steamers that retreated into the Yangtze River have all been under the jurisdiction of the Bureau. At the end of the 27th year, the Bureau moved to Chongqing and handled new businesses such as towing shoals and shipbuilding. The affairs suddenly became complicated. Recently, the Sichuan River Navigation Affairs Office was abolished, and all navigation affairs in Sichuan Province were also assigned to the Bureau for management. The Ministry of Communications believed that the Bureau's business had expanded and the original organization was difficult to adapt. In order to adjust the organization, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, the Bureau was reorganized into the Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau, and the area under its jurisdiction was expanded to the entire Yangtze River line. From now on, as the military advances to Jiangsu and Anhui, the navigation administration along the river can also be promoted at any time. The Ministry of Communications has ordered the Hankou Navigation Bureau to actively prepare for the reorganization, which is limited to August 1. Wang Guang is still appointed as the director of the bureau. (Telegram of the 21st)

### European "V" Movement; "V" is the Initial Letter of "Victory"; Both Britain and Germany Claim to be the Originators

Reuters, London, 21st – Although Germany and its occupied territories forbid people from listening to British broadcasts, with severe penalties for violators, the "V" movement initiated by British Prime Minister Churchill is being eagerly listened to by residents everywhere. Therefore, the German side has now changed its strategy, claiming that the "V" represents Germany's victory. Last night, Berlin Radio announced that "V"-shaped flags are hanging everywhere in the Netherlands, and that similar symbols are also present in countries like France and Belgium. Aircraft are even dropping "V"-shaped leaflets from the air.

Reuters, London, 21st – The "V" movement, being promoted in the occupied areas of Europe, has spread to London. The letter "V" is the initial letter of "Victory," symbolizing the inevitable victory of democratic nations. Now, the letter "V" can be seen everywhere in London: on the walls of buildings, on vehicles, and in train stations. Even the headlines of newspapers are arranged in the shape of a "V".

### Overview of American Military Production; Aircraft, Tanks, Warships, Firearms, etc., Are All Actively Increasing Production

Havas, Washington Aviation Correspondence – The American government has now entered a new fiscal year. Based on figures released by official and semi-official sources, the situation of America's unprecedented military buildup is vividly portrayed. Officials have repeatedly stated that the national defense plan currently completed accounts for only a small portion of the entire plan. Continued active production is needed thereafter. People in the National Defense Production Administration also said that the entire plan would cost more than $100 billion. To date, the government has ordered $19 billion worth of war materials, and Congress has approved $44 billion in operating expenses. Some of these figures are not made public due to national defense secrets. The semi-official "Army Gazette" revealed some of these figures: (1) The average monthly production of military aircraft is around 1,500 units, an increase of about 300 units compared to a year ago. This fiscal year, there is even more momentum for increase. Some quarters believe that 30,000 units can be manufactured throughout the year. The total number of units manufactured throughout the previous year was less than 12,000 units. The exact figures are as follows: 547 units in July 1940, 586 units in August, 670 units in September, 742 units in October, 779 units in November, 900 units in December, 1,036 units in January 1941, 975 units in February, 1,216 units in March, 1,427 units in April, 1,376 units in May, and approximately 1,500 units in June. The reduction in production in February was due to changes in styles, shortages of raw materials, and strikes. The reduction in May was due to the suspension of production of small fighter aircraft and the longer time required to transform larger bombers. (2) Regarding tanks, 150 thirteen-ton light tanks are manufactured each month. Twenty-six-ton tanks have been redesigned and temporarily suspended from production in order to utilize mechanical tools to manufacture other more important war equipment. Production is expected to resume to its original state around late summer or early autumn. However, the army currently has six times more light tanks than it did a year ago. (3) Regarding the navy, as of May 1, 1941, there are a total of fifteen battleships in active service and seventeen under construction. Among them, the "North Carolina" and "Washington" (with a displacement of 35,000 tons each) have been launched, but have not yet been incorporated into the fleet. There are a total of six aircraft carriers in active service and twelve under construction, 165 destroyers in active service and 199 under construction, and 109 submarines in active service and 78 under construction. (4) Although the exact numbers of general military supplies such as guns, artillery, and ammunition are unknown, it is reported that tens of thousands of "Garand" rifles can be manufactured every day, nearly doubling the number compared to a year ago. The number of .30-caliber machine guns has tripled compared to before, the number of .50-caliber machine guns has quadrupled, and the number of field guns and anti-aircraft guns has increased by 35% to 40%. Four hundred reconnaissance vehicles can be manufactured each month, and the amount of gunpowder has increased tenfold to twelvefold. In summary, the only shortcoming of the national defense industry is that the mechanical tools required for manufacturing military equipment cannot meet demand. However, at present, 1,000 types of mechanical tools can be manufactured every day, and their distribution to major arsenals has also been significantly improved.

### Rumor of Japanese Withdrawal from South Africa

The newspaper also stated that Japan's diplomacy is based on the Tripartite Alliance and the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. The latter treaty is effective for Japan in dealing with the Pacific situation and resolving the China Incident. Currently, due to the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the foundation of Far Eastern policy has also changed. Therefore, Japan's responsibility for the Far East has increased. Miyako Shimbun advocates that Japan's policy should be completely focused on resolving the China Incident and developing the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.

### German Troops Concentrate on the Turkish Border, Seeking to Occupy the Dardanelles; Plan for a New Macedonian State Drafted; Plan to Include Baltic States

Reuters, Moscow, 21st – Well-informed diplomatic circles in Turkey claim that Germany intends to seize the Dardanelles Strait.

Moscow Radio broadcast last night that, according to sources in Ankara, the German Foreign Office has drafted a plan to reorganize the Balkan Peninsula, including the establishment of a new Macedonian state with Western and Eastern Thrace and the Dardanelles area. Italian residents in Ankara have expressed disappointment with this plan and believe that it contradicts Hitler's promise that Italy should occupy important locations in the Mediterranean.

Reuters, Lisbon, 21st – According to news received here, Germany claims to have liberated the occupied Baltic states. However, the people of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and western Ukraine now know that their countries, in the plan for Germanic Europe, will only become German provinces or protectorates.

Reuters, London, 21st – The new type of infantry heavy tank currently being mass-produced in British factories has been named the Churchill tank by Minister of Supply Beaverbrook.

Even when stationary, this tank can be used as a fortress. The structure of this tank is currently kept secret. Its movement and turning are as easy to drive as a car. The Prime Minister has personally driven it and praised its ease of driving.

### Coastal Skies British Planes Active Axis Nations' Ships Destroyed: 55,000 Tons

Reuters, London, 21st - The Air Ministry intelligence office states that yesterday, six Hurricane British planes attacked an enemy oil tanker off the Dutch coast, setting it ablaze with hits. Simultaneously, another six Hurricane British planes heavily strafed an anti-aircraft ship protecting the oil tanker, firing thousands of rounds and rendering it ineffective.

The enemy ship exploded and emitted smoke, fleeing towards the coast. The Air Ministry also stated that British planes were active in the coastal skies on Sunday, and British fighter planes were also active in the skies over northern France.

### Dutch East Indies Parliament Focuses on Post-War Relations with China 1.5 Million Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies Diplomatic Improvement Deemed Necessary

Reuters, Batavia, 21st - A commentator on Dutch East Indies radio last night broadcast to the Netherlands that the most discussed topics in the Dutch East Indies parliament are the post-war status of the Dutch East Indies and the relationship between the Dutch East Indies and China and Japan. Mr. Gan, a Chinese member of parliament, recently advocated for improving relations with China because there are over 1.5 million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. Once the war in China ends, China will experience significant development, which must be considered. Members of parliament generally believe that the relationship between the Dutch East Indies and Japan is currently stable, but there are various possibilities, and they believe that the absolute preparedness of the Dutch East Indies is the most stable way to ensure peace. A spokesperson for the Dutch East Indies Catholic political party believes that there is a foundation for future successful cooperation in the interaction between Westerners and Asians. A faction in parliament, known for its advocacy of unity, has been promoting this cooperation for twenty years. This faction has recently advocated for a United States of the Dutch East Indies. The Queen of the Netherlands recently announced that the Dutch East Indies will have a new status after the war. However, the majority of members of parliament believe that the new situation and new relationship should be considered at this time and should not wait until after the end of the war. Therefore, the parliament recommends that an investigation be conducted by a conference or a delegation of representatives of the people of the Dutch East Indies. In short, the parliament is currently very focused on preparing for the new future of the Dutch East Indies, knowing that the Dutch East Indies will have an important role in the world.

### European War Discussions (70) Submarine Warfare Diary

The water's surface in the early morning was covered in fog, like a thin layer of wool. After a while, the sun rose from the east, perching high on the snow-capped mountains, like a red lantern. The fog on the water gradually dissipated, but the shore remained shrouded in mist. At that time, a submarine parked next to the mother ship untied its mooring lines and set sail, with its stern heading towards the center of the harbor. Slowly, the scenery on the shore became visible, and houses and trees gradually emerged, subtly revealing their colors in the winter dawn.

The submarine was floating on the surface of the water, slowly turning its hull, with spray splashing under its diving planes. The commander was focused on maneuvering his submarine, not looking towards the shore. He stood under the simple dome of the conning tower, his hands tucked tightly in the pockets of his coarse wool coat, a blue wool scarf wrapped around his neck, and his military cap, due to its age, had turned green. The helmsman and signalman were also standing next to him on this small platform, and six or seven soldiers in white undershirts were running around on the submarine, focused on the last-minute tasks.

The captain issued the order: "Engage both engines, forward at half speed!" At this moment, he glanced at the shore on the port side for the first time.

The helmsman pointed the submarine towards the water gate of the fortified harbor and said to him, "We will pass half a mile from the gate. Do you want to get closer? The water there is very deep."

The captain replied, "No need, just continue in this direction." After speaking, he took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, took one, lit it, and smoked, his gaze still fixed on the shore.

A few minutes later, a white object suddenly appeared in the window of a thatched cottage on the shore, slowly waving forward. The captain took out a handkerchief from his pocket and waved back in response. He mused that it was truly uninteresting to be the wife of a submariner on days like these. He tried hard to recall how many times he had had this kind of thought in this place, although he was often able to return. Just as he was lost in thought, his consciousness naturally told him not to think any further.

The white object had disappeared. This was what they had agreed upon, otherwise it would only increase the sorrow. He put the handkerchief back in his pocket, his eyes still watching the shore, but the shore was receding further and further away.

The helmsman said, "The water gate is open." He raised his binoculars, stared for a while, and said, "Our escort ship is waiting."

The captain coldly replied, "Good."

The captain of the destroyer escorting the submarine looked at the surging gray sea. A black dot was breaking through the waves. The sunlight had already faded, but the sunset glow in the western low sky was illuminating the sky red, like a fire that had gone out, but the iron grates were still red. The captain turned and ordered the signalman, "Signal the submarine: 'Our ship is about to turn back, what do you think?'"

In the dim twilight, the Aldis lamp flickered to signal the submarine. The people on the destroyer's bridge, because of the strong wind and rain, used their hands to shield their eyes and saw the submarine rising and falling with the waves, like a water snake, surging forward on the wave surface reddened by the setting sun. Sometimes only the dome of the conning tower and the periscope on the tower were visible, struggling with the waves. In the vast sea, it was like a lonely fortress. The people standing on the submarine, illuminated by the white spray, only showed half of their dark shadows of their heads and shoulders, which, in contrast to the surroundings, precisely expressed the ideals of courage and fortitude. The submarine's commander read the message, and a hint of a smile appeared on the young and fierce corner of his mouth. The signalman next to him raised his nimble signal lamp.

"Thank you for your kindness," this reply was sent across the waves by the light.

The destroyer's lamp moved again. She had turned the rudder and was making a large circle away from the submarine, leaving only a long white trail under the rudder.

The submarine's signalman reported: "Good luck and much success," but his tone was a little different. He had already sensed that the captain was tired of this kind of engraved farewell.

The captain hummed and said, "Just reply as usual! I really don't like flashing lights in this wide open sea and sky."

The signalman turned the mechanism, quickly making several dots and dashes, meaning "All the best, thank you for the escort."

The destroyer was visible for a while, gradually turning into a tiny black shadow, and then gradually disappeared into the undulating waves. After that, only a vast expanse of night remained.

On the platform of the submarine's conning tower, in addition to the captain, there were three officers, a lieutenant in charge of torpedo firing, a signalman, and a lookout. They all raised their binoculars and looked out at the sea, the lenses rotating back and forth along an arc, and their heads slowly followed. The platform shook violently, but they were still very natural. Their movements were silent and maintained a certain rhythm, like automatons or wax figures, driven by machinery.

The captain's gaze was directed at the bottom of the conning tower hatch. He opened his mouth first and said, "Now that things are over, I really want to have a cup of tea." At that time, only the hum of the diesel engine at the bottom of the tower and a person singing out of tune, "If you were the only girl in the world..." could be heard.

The torpedo lieutenant put down his binoculars, his face turned from the sea. He was wearing a coarse wool coat, at this time like a solemn young monk, but with an aesthetic eye.

He asked, "Are you still letting this submarine float on the surface of the sea?"

"No, we have to keep it safe. In any case, I don't really like letting her be on the surface in this kind of light."

This young monk said, "I have a bottle of cherry jam, which my mother sent me. I saved it because I wanted to eat it on the road."

The captain pressed the button and transmitted the order to the body of the submarine below them. The signalman quickly ran down the tower, followed by two officers. Only the captain glanced around before descending. Immediately, the roar of the diesel engine ceased, and the soft whirring of the engine followed. The line of sight had shrunk to several hundred yards, and the seawater impacted and shook the bottom of the conning tower all around. Splashes of water freezing on the ship's cables. The captain hurriedly jumped into the entrance, slammed the hatch shut, and then entered the electrical control room. A naval lieutenant in the room turned around to greet him, with an expectant expression on his face. (To be continued)

### After the Reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet Still Maintains a Bystander Attitude Moderate Elements Tend to Rise Basic Policies Seem to Show No Signs of Change Shanghai "North-China Daily News" Discusses the Trends of the New Japanese Cabinet

The formation of the Third Konoe Cabinet, and its subsequent trends, have attracted the attention of people around the world. According to the private remarks made by observers in this port, the recruitment of Toyoda into the cabinet by Konoe, to serve as foreign minister, is the rise of the moderate faction. It is said that, among Japanese diplomatic figures, Matsuoka was quite active, only slightly less than the extremist elements such as Toshio Shiratori. Toyoda has always been known for his stability. According to their opinions, Japanese policy will likely continue to maintain a bystander attitude. Yesterday, the "North-China Daily News" also discussed the future trends of the new Japanese cabinet. Here is the translation:

Cabinet Reorganization in a Difficult Situation

Konoe has formed a cabinet for the third time. The only reason for the sudden collapse of the Japanese cabinet this time was to remove Foreign Minister Matsuoka alone. The results obtained by Matsuoka during his previous trip to Europe will either force Japan to assist the Axis according to the planned schedule, or will prevent Japan from obtaining the corresponding concessions from the Axis as expected. This is seen as extremely embarrassing in Tokyo. Therefore, observers generally believe that Matsuoka should have been dismissed long ago, and it is too late to wait until today. Now that Toyoda has replaced Matsuoka, this person is slightly more mature and prudent and cannot be compared with those who are hasty and reckless. However, it is not accurate to regard this as a symbol of a change in Japan's basic policies.

Estrangement from the Axis Seems Possible

There is little doubt that the new cabinet's foreign policy will be based on the decisions made at the Imperial Conference a month ago. However, the methods of implementation will be different. This can be inferred from the new foreign minister's statement that Japan adopts a free and independent foreign policy. As for whether the new cabinet will express Japan's estrangement from the Axis, it remains to be seen. However, Tokyo's refusal to obey Hitler's orders seems possible. If Konoe's third cabinet is anti-Axis, then the moderate faction in Japan has defeated the extremist elements. This is because Mitsui and Sumitomo, which represent the Japanese financial and industrial giants, have a close relationship with the Japanese cabinet and have the power to influence it. The military and naval forces' permission to cooperate with the new cabinet, in the eyes of moderates, seems to indicate that Japan knows that hasty actions will plunge Japan into irretrievable disaster.

Fundamental Policies Unlikely to Change

In recent months, the attitudes of the United Kingdom and the United States towards the Pacific issue have become increasingly active. They are unwilling to sit idly by and watch their interests being infringed. If Japan's desires are insatiable, it will inevitably cause a counterattack from the United Kingdom and the United States. This is well known to people in Tokyo. Moreover, when Japan was preparing its military and implementing the plans set by the extremists, the European situation had already changed. Therefore, it is not unfounded that we conclude that Japan's future policies will still not deviate from the old framework.

Threats to the UK and the US Will Never Be Tolerated

Opinions vary as to whether the new cabinet will improve Japan's relations with the UK and the US. However, in general, there is a significant possibility. However, we still have a word to tell Tokyo that the attitudes of the UK and the US towards Japan's invasion plans have already been decided, and there will be no changes in the future. As for ending the "New Order in East Asia" that has created Japan's monopoly, it is also unacceptable to the UK and the US. If Japanese policies threaten the interests of the UK and the US in the Far East, then the UK and the US will not hesitate to defend the rights and interests of this part of the world. We sincerely hope that the new Japanese cabinet can recognize this fact and manage national policies so that peace in the Pacific can be maintained and not collapse.

### Shanghai and Hong Kong National Goods Merchants Ordered to Develop Trade with India Indian Manufacturers Eager to Trade with China Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Office Forms a Business Delegation for Investigation

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong Office received an order from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating that Indian commercial firms are eagerly hoping to trade with our country. They requested that Shanghai and Hong Kong national goods industrial and commercial groups be united to form a business delegation to go to India and Southeast Asia to investigate, in order to develop foreign trade of national products. On July 14, the Shanghai-based Su-Zhe-Hu Merchant Association in Hong Kong, invited the Overseas Chinese Production and Construction Association, Southwest Industrial Construction Association, China National Goods Industrial Service Society, China National Goods Production and Marketing Association, Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, China National Goods Manufacturers Association and other groups to meet. Preparatory committee members were appointed to make efforts to proceed, in the hope that it would be accomplished as soon as possible.

Instructions from the Ministry of Economic Affairs

The Ministry of Economic Affairs instructed the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that the Ministry has received a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, forwarding two items from the Consulate in Bombay regarding the promotion of foreign trade, as well as a list of Indian commercial firms and the goods they require. They were instructed to verify and handle them. It has been found that, due to the European war, the import and export of goods in India has decreased sharply. General manufacturers are eager to switch to trading with our country and have requested introductions to Chinese merchants to communicate with them. Now is the time for our merchants to take the opportunity to promote trade with India in order to develop the export of national products. The Chamber of Commerce should contact Shanghai and Hong Kong national goods industrial and commercial groups to form a business delegation to investigate the actual situation in the Southeast Asian market, in order to establish contact methods. The latest list of factory and firm names and detailed addresses submitted by the Consulate in Bombay will be sent by the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce is to be informed of this order, and appropriate steps are to be taken.

Two Items for Promotion

As for the two items for the promotion of foreign trade, they are listed below: (1) Domestic authorities, such as the International Trade Bureau and merchant groups (major city chambers of commerce, exporters' associations, or certain commercial associations), should classify and compile a directory of all manufacturers in the country according to their products, detailing the nature of the company (limited, unlimited, individual operation, etc.), name, address, total capital, whether it is registered, the bank with which it deals, its past credit, etc., and report it to the embassies and consulates for reference. If a foreign merchant inquires or requests an introduction to a manufacturer, it can be answered at any time. (2) If domestic manufacturers have doubts about the credit of a foreign merchant, they can report its name and address to the embassies and consulates, which can conduct local investigations to avoid losses to domestic manufacturers.

Forming a Delegation

The Shanghai and Hong Kong industrial and commercial circles' Southeast Asia business delegation has selected Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Ye Lanquan, and twelve other preparatory committee members, and Wang Xiaolai has been elected as the chairman, and Pan Yangyao and Cao Zhigong as secretaries. Regarding the organization of the delegation and the issues of investigation sites, routes, and funding, it has been decided to have Tang Weibin and Pan Yangyao responsible for drafting. A request will be made to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for a subsidy for the delegation. The investigation period is tentatively scheduled for two to three months, and it is hoped that national goods manufacturers will participate to live up to the expectations of Southeast Asia. It is heard that the delegation will focus on departing from Hong Kong.

### Two Million Pounds of Relief Wheat Arrives

The new cargo ship Azalea City, commissioned by the American Red Cross to carry two million pounds of crushed wheat to Shanghai, arrived directly from Seattle yesterday morning. The ship docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. The American wheat carried to Shanghai will be used to relieve refugees in Shanghai and the occupied areas. Among them, there are also 50,000 pounds of milk powder, which will be distributed to refugee children by church hospitals. The Azalea City and the Freydis are sister ships designed and built by the American Shipping Association, specializing in sailing between the Far East and the United States. The ship needs to dock for two days and will leave directly for Manila this Wednesday. Additional crushed wheat for China will be unloaded in Hong Kong.

### American Cotton and Flour Arrive in Large Quantities in Shanghai More Than 30,000 Bales of Cotton 400,000 Bags of Flour

The Azalea City, managed by Wah Lung & Co., arrived from Santos in South America

Cotton

Sixteen thousand bales arrived in port yesterday evening and docked at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong to unload. In addition, the SS Pan Gnlb has even more cotton coming in, totaling approximately 20,996 bales, which will arrive in Shanghai this Thursday. It is heard that in addition to a large amount of cotton, the ship also has

Flour

Two thousand seven hundred and ninety-three tons, approximately 120,000 bags plus. Also, the SS Don jose has 291,200 bags of flour and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th. The above three ships are all managed by Wah Lung & Co. Most of the cotton was purchased by Japanese spinning mills and originally transported by Japanese ships. Due to the US government's export control, Japanese ships going to the US have decreased, so they have switched to other ships for transportation.

### Portuguese Captain Rescues People in Danger

The English "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that Mr. Silva, the Portuguese captain of the Portuguese ship Santarem, received an award from the Portuguese Maritime Association for rescuing four Chinese people at sea on October 24 last year. It is reported that the Santarem left Shanghai on July 23 last year, heading to the vicinity of Haizhou. The next morning, Captain Silva saw flotsam floating in the water about seven kilometers from the ship. He ordered the rudder to be turned and sailed towards it. He saw a sailboat that had been damaged and was about to sink. Of the ten boatmen, only four were left, barely alive. Mr. Silva quickly ordered the crew to rescue the four people, take care of them, and raise 50 yuan to send them ashore.

### Coal Briquette Prices Plummet, Trade Rivals Engage in Secret Struggles, Small Factories Intensify Production to Suppress High Prices, Large Factories Helpless and Perplexed

Coal briquette prices, previously due to hoarding and speculation, with major coal briquette factories citing soaring water transportation costs, raising prices arbitrarily without the legal permission of the trade association. On one hand, factories such as Yi Tai Xing and Nanyang stopped selling all raw materials to small coal briquette factories, causing prices to skyrocket several times. Small coal briquette factories, due to the monopoly of raw materials, were unable to produce, and jointly requested the association to intervene and stop it.

Small Factory Competition

Subsequently, the trade association turned to raw material suppliers such as Yi Tai Xing, Da Long Xing, and Tong Cheng to request the supply of raw materials to small factories to facilitate their business. As a result, only Tong Cheng Company provided a portion, leading to soaring prices due to supply exceeding demand at the time (as high as 320 yuan per ton, 17 yuan per dan). Later, small factories turned to other sources for raw materials, intensified production, and competed with large factories, and market prices gradually fell back.

Hot Weather, Slow Sales

Now that the weather is hot, and citizens are threatened by life, they all advocate cold food, and coal briquette sales have sharply decreased (and because coal briquettes are more expensive than firewood and kerosene, most people switch to firewood). In winter, daily sales reach 1,500 tons, but now only 500 tons are sold daily. Due to oversupply, prices have gradually fallen back in recent days, with each ton selling for only 270-280 yuan, and each dan ranging from 13 to 15 yuan. However, sales are still difficult to improve.

Trade Disputes

Due to raw material issues, coal briquette businesses, large and small, have been engaged in business competition since the Zhao Men incident. There have also been cases of refusing to pay membership fees and withdrawing from the association. The trade association has scheduled a joint meeting of all executive supervisors and also requested legal adjudication, but the outcome is still unknown.

### Two Shootings Yesterday, Wu De Zhou Killed, Family Killed in Songjiang Two Months Ago, Came to Shanghai for Treatment and Was Shot Dead, Pig Intestine Merchant Couple Died Tragically

Yesterday at 11:00 AM, a shooting occurred on Avenue Grosier in the French Concession. The deceased was named Wang De Zhou. At the time, he was shot by a man lying in wait, suffering three shots, all in vital areas, and died. Police officers who heard the shots rushed to pursue the shooter, and both sides exchanged gunfire, injuring a Vietnamese police officer. Among the escaping suspects, one was arrested with a leg injury. The details are as follows:

Family Killed, Came to Shanghai Alone

Wang De Zhou, a 35-year-old native of Songjiang, currently residing at No. 5, Lane 51, Avenue Grosier in the French Concession, was a graduate of the Whampoa Military Academy. He previously served in the military and joined Ding Xishan's forces last year, stationed in the suburbs of Shanghai. Wang himself and his family lived in Songjiang. Two months ago, Wang was stabbed and injured in Songjiang, and his mother, wife, and two children were all killed. Wang escaped to Shanghai with injuries and went to Hongkou Fumin Hospital every day to treat his wounds. Wang's life in Shanghai was very wealthy, and he had a private car with license plate number 11682 for transportation. His mother-in-law, Gu Li, 52 years old, stayed in Shanghai to care for Wang.

Shot While Stepping Out of Residence

Yesterday at 11:00 AM, Wang left his residence, intending to go to Fumin Hospital for treatment of his gunshot wounds. He was wearing a gray suit, but because his foot was not healed, he could not wear leather shoes, so he changed into black cloth shoes with leather soles and walked out. Just as he was about to step into the car at the door, two men suddenly jumped out of the lane, blocked his way, and fired shots at Wang, firing four shots in a row, hitting Wang's chest and other parts three times. He fell into a pool of blood in extreme pain and died on the spot.

Injured Vietnamese Police Officer, One Suspect Arrested

The shooters, seeing that their purpose had been achieved, took a rickshaw and fled along Avenue Grosier towards Avenue Petain, Avenue Paul Henry, and Rue Massenet. When they reached the intersection of Avenue Haig, intending to enter the Chinese area, they were intercepted by police officers stationed there because there was barbed wire and suspicious individuals. The two suspects, seeing the situation was not good, took preemptive action and fired at the police officers. The officers returned fire, and as a result, a Vietnamese officer No. 61 was hit in the back of the right hand by a bullet. One of the suspects was also shot in the leg and fell to the ground and was captured. A box cannon was seized. The other suspect escaped.

Strict Investigation of the Inside Story of the Case

After Wang De Zhou was shot, the French police also received a report and immediately dispatched a large team of Chinese and foreign detectives to search for the shooters. They took the captured man back to the police station and, after a brief interrogation, ordered him to be sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. His name has not yet been announced. The police are currently investigating the case. Wang's body was first sent to Guangci Hospital and, after examination by a doctor, was transferred to the autopsy room on Avenue Testelin. However, Wang had no relatives in Shanghai. Today, his mother-in-law, Gu Li, will come forward to claim the body for burial. The inside story of the case is currently under strict investigation by the police.

### Pig Intestine Merchant Couple Killed

Yesterday morning at 6:00 AM, in a house on the Yan Jia Zhai on Route Say Zoong in Western Shanghai, lived Gao Qi Nong (46 years old) from Anhui and his wife, Zhou (41 years old), also from the same hometown. They made a living buying fresh pig intestines and bristles for many years and had accumulated some savings. Yesterday morning at 6:00 AM, it was said that a man who usually associated with Gao, along with two young men, went to knock on Gao's door, claiming to have ten pig intestines for sale. Gao and his wife were still in bed, but since they were acquaintances, they got up and took the pig intestines. Just as they were about to pay for the goods, the visitor unexpectedly pulled out a pistol and fired several shots at Gao Qi Nong and his wife. Gao and his wife were caught off guard, and both were shot and fell into a pool of blood. Gao was shot once in the head, and the bullet entered from his mouth. Zhou was shot once in the abdomen. The shooter, seeing that their purpose had been achieved, fled with the weapon. Later, Gao's nephew, Shou Gen, and niece, A Mao, from No. 31 next door, rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and urgently called an ambulance to take Gao and his wife to Tongren Second Hospital on Avenue General Foch for treatment. However, due to the wounds being in vital areas, the two died on the way. The Shanghai West Special Police were unable to determine the motive of this bloody case, but believed that Gao was killed by competitors in the pig intestine business who held a grudge and committed this heinous act, causing him to die by gunfire.

### Leaflets Found Inside the Great World, Large Number of Detectives Rushed to Search, and Ordered to Close Business Yesterday

Yesterday at around 3:00 PM, a rather serious incident suddenly occurred inside the Great World. It is reported that at around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, someone was distributing leaflets inside the Peking Opera venue of the Great World. At first, no one noticed, but later more and more were distributed, so the detectives stationed at the entertainment venue reported to the police station. The police authorities dispatched a large number of detectives to search for the person distributing the leaflets inside the venue. On the one hand, the police ordered the entertainment venue to close business, forcing all tourists to leave. Therefore, the Great World hung up a red sign at around 4:00 PM, which read "Ordered by the police station to temporarily suspend business," and the entrance was full of detectives, not allowing pedestrians to stop, and the situation was very serious. It is also rumored that when the detectives entered to search, there were also four Japanese military police officers who accompanied them, but the search yielded nothing, and the distributed leaflets were all taken away by the police.

### The Commercial Press Resumes Business

The Commercial Press has been closed for three months due to labor disputes. It resumed business yesterday. It is reported that the internal reorganization of the company, manager Li [omitted character] requested leave due to illness, and Bao Qinglin acted as agent. Manager Xia Xiaofang also requested leave, and Li Bojia acted as agent. Shi Jiu Yun and Wang Kang Sheng both served as associate managers. Six [omitted character] managers were established, three stationed in Hong Kong and three in Shanghai. All original departments and profit shares were abolished and replaced with four groups. The first group was in charge of production and personnel. The second group was in charge of business documents, stock affairs, safekeeping, and various inspections. The third group was in charge of purchasing, warehouse affairs, accounting, and cashier. The fourth group was in charge of editing and reviewing. Each group established its own responsibilities and handled affairs separately. The organization of the Shanghai distribution office and the plate making and printing plant remained the same, but some parts were slightly modified and merged. Yesterday, the distribution office and two branch stores of the company were operating in the market, and it was quite crowded.

### Parts for Marre Launch Exported, Suddenly Detained by the Japanese Military, Parts Installed Were Not Important, British, American and Japanese Sides Are Negotiating

The Hilda Marre wheel of the British company Laidlaw & Co. was anchored at floats thirteen and fourteen, loading goods, and cleared customs last Saturday.

Intended to Sail to Five Ports Including Hong Kong

It was planned to sail the next day, Sunday (20th), to five ports including Hong Kong, Singapore, Yangon, Kolkata, and Suez. The afternoon before, just as it was about to set sail, a Japanese naval motorboat, carrying many Japanese soldiers, arrived at the Marre wheel and moored.

Still Under Surveillance Yesterday Evening

After each Japanese soldier boarded the ship, they stated that they were not allowed to set sail. The shipowner tried to negotiate without success, and the ship could not be exported. As of yesterday evening, it was still under surveillance at floats thirteen and fourteen. It is heard that the ship was loaded with many unimportant machine parts, and the Japanese side used this as an excuse to detain the ship. The British and Japanese sides are currently negotiating.

### Traffic in the Hongkou District Temporarily Blocked Yesterday, Because Three People Were Found Acting Suspiciously, Shot and Fled, Leaving Behind a Hand Grenade

Even Japanese police officers from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department were restricted. At around 1:00 PM, those wearing uniforms with numbers were allowed to pass. The situation was tense at the time, and rumors were rife. Alcott said during the noon broadcast that a Japanese person was shot in Hongkou, but this point has been denied by the Japanese Navy spokesman yesterday.

Bridges Blocked for a Major Search

According to reliable sources, the reason why the Japanese army suddenly implemented special martial law yesterday was because three Chinese people tried to break through a window and enter a certain house in Renzhi Lane near North Sichuan Road. This was spotted by a Japanese person who was about to rush to the police station to report it. The three Chinese people, seeing that their plan had been exposed, fired a shot and attempted to escape. The nearby Japanese military police immediately rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm, saw the three people from afar, and ran south towards North Sichuan Road without a trace. The Japanese military police also found a hand grenade near the scene and believed that the case was serious. It was believed that the three people were terrorists, so they immediately closed the bridges and surrounded the vicinity of Renzhi Lane, searching house by house. As a result, nothing was found, and the ban was lifted at around 2:00 PM. However, the investigation is still ongoing. According to the Shewen News Agency, five Chinese people were arrested at the time, and four pistols were seized.

Western Newspaper Indicates One Person Was Captured

The English-language North China Daily News reported that the Japanese authorities in Hongkou received intelligence this morning (21st) that five terrorists were planning to go to a certain house in Renzhi Lane, Hongkou. Therefore, at 9:20 AM this morning, all bridges over the Suzhou Creek connecting to Hongkou were closed. According to reliable sources, a certain Chinese person hired by the Japanese Naval Headquarters first received a report that the terrorists would go to the house in the morning, so he planned to go to the scene to spy on the situation. He walked along North Sichuan Road and, near the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, suddenly saw the five terrorists in front of him. Mr. Jia recognized one of them, so he pulled out a pistol and fired a shot into the air to warn the Japanese military police. The terrorists suddenly heard the gunshot and ran away. The Japanese military police had already rushed out upon hearing the sound and captured one person. At the same time, they closed the bridges in order to capture the remaining four people, but they were unsuccessful. At 12:40 PM in the afternoon, the bridges were reopened.

### Special Martial Law Near Zhabei Station, Japanese Soldiers Beat Japanese People

Starting at around 9:00 AM yesterday, special martial law was suddenly implemented in the area of Zhabei North Railway Station towards Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road. Japanese naval marines, military police, Chinese police, etc. were stationed along the road, one post every five steps, and the situation was very tense. Vehicles and pedestrians were prohibited from passing. Passengers on the 9:30 AM special express train from Shanghai to Nanjing, the 10:20 AM ordinary passenger train, the 11:00 AM Suzhou train, and the 11:55 AM Nanjing train were all

Unable to pass, they all watched in the concession road area, otherwise they had to detour in the direction of the New Zha Bridge. Even Japanese businessmen, etc., were not allowed to pass. Officials passing through had to show their passes. At the intersection of Qiujiang Road, a certain Japanese person slightly debated with the guard there because he had something important to do, and was beaten, his head bleeding. Another Japanese person, seeing the Japanese soldier hindering the beaten person, tried to take the opportunity to pass through the post and was chased back by the Japanese

Soldier reported with slaps and gun handles, thrown to the ground, beaten severely and ordered to return. Another person, a certain Jia, riding in a car, was dragged out of the car and beaten severely for trying to pass through forcefully, and was seriously injured. This alert did not end until nearly 1:00 PM in the afternoon. During these few hours, no less than 30 Japanese people who wanted to pass through the posts in various places were beaten. However, there were no Chinese people among them. The Taikoo Company Guangdong wheel, contracted to transport the machine parts entrusted by Anli Foreign Company, was detained by the Japanese army in Wusong on the 10th of this month, and the machine parts were unloaded. This unloading work was just completed last Saturday. The ship was originally scheduled to set sail south on the same day, but was postponed to yesterday morning due to the hurricane. As for this item, the Japanese side claimed to be inspecting, but since it had already been unloaded, it is said that it will no longer be inspected. Regarding the question of the subsequent disposal, Anli did not express anything, only saying that the case will be handled by the British Consul General in Shanghai.

### Yarn, Should Rise But Does Not, Could There Be Something Wrong With the Yarn Market? Throwing In and Throwing Out… Actions Are Unpredictable

The yarn market started and continued to fall, and was weaker than Saturday's price. It is conceivable that the popularity is not good. It is actually because the customer gangs' transactions are dull, and Nian Zhi yarn is indigestion. Today, only 55 pieces were exported to Yangon. At the same time, although cotton prices rose sharply, market prices could not rise sharply, which aroused the ideals of general speculators. It should have risen but did not, fearing that there was something wrong, so a large amount was frequently spit out. As a result, the stage loosened, and those who were shorting and grabbing hats took the opportunity to be active. In addition, rumors unfavorable to the bulls took advantage of the situation, and the market wanted to rise but fell instead. A certain note on the market dragged in a large amount, but a certain major household also threw out a lot. In and out, I don’t know what the reason is. The highest price of 20-count Shuang Ma was 1,615 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,591 yuan. It initially traded at 1,590 yuan in the afternoon, rose to 1,596 yuan, and the final price was 1,5923 yuan. The current yarn market should rise given the sharp rise in every foreign cotton market. However, the Hong Kong gangs' Nian Zhi yarn transactions are not smooth, and people's hearts are not encouraged and are depressed.

Shuang Ma opened in the morning because US cotton jumped more than 50 pounds on the weekend. People's hearts in the market unanimously hoped to rise, and the popularity was strong. The first bid was called 1,618-9 yuan, and the result was a father price of 1,615 yuan. At this time, the reward households were enthusiastic, but a certain Fengzhao City dragged in a huge amount. Fortunately, a part of it was thrown out as much as possible, so it held for a moment. It was heard that gold prices were flat, and the Guangdong gangs had ins and outs for Shuang Ma yarn. People's hearts relaxed, and the market tended to fall, to 1,598 yuan. Although there was a struggle in the middle, rumors unfavorable to the bulls rose up at the time. By the time the market closed, it was still not good, and the result was 1,591 yuan. It was found that the half-day transaction statistics were 6,165 bales. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:

Jin Shuang Ma futures yarn market conditions: At the beginning of the morning market, the spot yarn price also rose sharply due to the sharp rise in US cotton. Jinhao and Zheng [omitted character] Gang were optimistic and bought in. The August period rose five yuan from the previous increase, the September period rose six yuan, and the initial market price for the October period was 1,528 yuan. After the opening, there were many new buyers and those covering short positions. August once rose to 1,466 yuan, September rose to 1,527 yuan, and October stabilized. After entering, the foreign exchange rate and the remaining price suddenly turned calm, and passenger sales still did not improve significantly. As a result, the bulls took the opportunity to take profits and get out of the market, and the price quickly turned downward. August once fell to a minimum of 1,450 yuan and 5 jiao, September was 1,516 yuan, and October was 1,529 yuan. Afterwards, there was a slight recovery. The noon closing price for August and September both fell three yuan. The transaction volume was 7,075 bales. The subsequent market situation continued to be weak, and the August period fell to a minimum of 1,448 yuan, the September period was 1,512 yuan and a half, and the October period was 1,528 yuan. After entering, there was a slight recovery. As a result, the August period fell four yuan compared to the previous day, the September period fell two yuan and a half, and the October period had no comparison. The total transaction volume for the day was 9,880 bales, an increase of 4,910 bales from the previous day. The full-day opening, closing, high, and low prices are recorded on the left (this is the net plate call price).

### Large Quantities of American Cotton Arrive at Port; More Expected Soon; Cotton Market Inevitably Affected

The current cotton situation remains firm, as American cotton prices surge and Indian cotton follows suit, leading to daily increases in purchase prices. Industry sentiment is increasingly bullish, and the price of coarse cotton continues to rise. In other news, foreign cotton orders in Shanghai are robust due to further increases in American cotton prices and strong market conditions. At the same time, demand is keen from all quarters, and purchasing interest is high. Although the continuous arrival of Brazilian cotton has caused some congestion, spot prices remain above 460 yuan. As a result, some foreign-owned spinning mills are happy to place orders, as American, Indian, and Brazilian cotton arriving in Shanghai in August and September seem more cost-effective. Yesterday's total transaction volume exceeded 1,000 bales, with Brazilian cotton accounting for more than half. Furthermore, cotton suitable for 40-count yarn is priced around 450 yuan. A large quantity of Chinese cotton arrived in Shanghai on the Azalea City, a Hua Lun Shipping cargo ship chartered by Yi Li, carrying 16,000 pieces of cotton from Santos, South America, arriving at the port around 7:00 PM yesterday and docking at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading. It is reported that more large shipments of cotton are expected to arrive soon. (Zu)

### Piece Goods: Large Discrepancy Between Domestic and Foreign Prices; Fabric Stockpilers Remain Confident

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market trend was stable, and transaction sentiment among industry stockpilers saw renewed development. This is because factory prices are gradually increasing, and domestic cloth prices are more than double those in Shanghai. However, due to control measures, there is no hope for smooth sales. Yesterday's cloth prices were flat. This street handled over 600 pieces of grey cloth, bleached cloth, and printed cloth, while the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Nanyang group handled 200-plus pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and colored cloth, and the North Road Tianjin group handled over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, flannel, and colored cloth. Furthermore, 79 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Singapore today (the 22nd), and another 1,695 pieces were shipped to Rangoon.

Eastern Cloth: After an initial rise, the market weakened. Bai Huo Longtou Fine Cloth Factory closed in the afternoon at 49.25 yuan, down 0.075 yuan. Si Jun Zi Serge in colored cloth was 1.60875 yuan, also slightly down 0.00125 yuan.

### Finance: Japanese Spinning Mills Acquire Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The black market saw only slight fluctuations, shifting from tight to slightly loose. Initially, Japanese banks did not sell, but Japanese spinning mills suddenly made purchases, followed by speculators, causing the US dollar to tighten to 5.28125 yuan. However, British and American commercial banks showed some willingness to supply, and speculators also moved to cover their positions. 5.34375 yuan for forward months was once strong enough to be settled, but in the afternoon, speculators again aggressively covered their positions, making it difficult to sell the US dollar at 5.34375 yuan. Eventually, British and American commercial banks shifted to buying, bringing the market back to equilibrium. The closing price was the same as last Saturday's closing price, with thin trading volume.

American Banks Supply

Since morning, there have been no changes in the British and American markets for foreign exchange from foreign exchange banks, and there have been no changes in the exchange rates of British and American currencies against foreign currencies. Central bank listed rates have not changed. In the domestic market, banks opened with selling prices of 3 pence and 23.4375 yuan for spot British gold, and 5.3125 yuan for US dollars. Japanese spinning mills initially bought US dollars for July delivery at 5.3125 yuan, which then softened slightly, becoming difficult to settle, settling only at 5.28125 yuan. HSBC listed rates remained unchanged. The silver parity tax remained at 23.75%. HSBC's small counter reduced the US dollar rate by 0.0625 yuan to 5.25 yuan. In the black market, American banks such as Chase and Citibank supplied July US dollars at 5.3125 yuan. After a certain foreign bank absorbed these, Chinese merchants also settled, and the market was quite stable. Speculators subsequently came to unwind at 5.34375 yuan, once so strong that settlement was possible at the quoted price. However, the afternoon closing price for British gold was 3 pence and 23.4375 yuan, and for US dollars, 5.3125 yuan.

Closing Price Unchanged

In the afternoon, speculators unwound their positions, causing the August US dollar to strengthen to a level at which it could be settled. Later, British and American commercial banks supplied at the quoted price, so the market soon returned to equilibrium. At the 4 o'clock closing, spot to August futures were all 3 pence and 23.4375 yuan for British gold, and 5.3125 yuan for US dollars, the same as last Saturday's closing price.

Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises Alone

Hong Kong, 21st (Monday): This morning, the foreign exchange market opened flat. The Shanghai exchange rate rose alone by 4 yuan, to 464 yuan. The rest were unchanged.

Tianjin: Both British and American Currencies Tighten

Tianjin, 21st (Monday): This morning, the foreign exchange market opened flat. London and New York telegraphic transfer rates both tightened by 0.03125. London was 3 pence 6875, and New York was 6.0625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate dropped by 0.25 yuan, to 87 yuan. The "Joint Note" in the black market was cheapened by 0.50 yuan, to 61 yuan.

### Cash Gold Soars; 510 Yuan Higher Than Futures

Yesterday's gold market saw wild fluctuations in the black market, suddenly becoming unpredictable, initially rising, then falling, and finally slightly rising again. Sentiment in all quarters was uncertain. In the morning, continuing the upward momentum from the end of last week, foreign short positions covered, briefly pushing the price to 6,570 yuan. This was fleeting, and the market immediately declined, as US dollar rates returned to equilibrium, and large Shanghai Westside gangs released significant volumes, with Li Tai selling nearly 10,000 taels and Yi Yuan also selling around 8,000 taels. However, remittance merchant Xinfeng repeatedly bought 11-12,000 taels, causing the market price to fall alone and trade heavily in the 6,534 yuan range. In the afternoon, rumors spread that German troops had approached Moscow, and the price briefly fell to 6,519 yuan amidst short covering by retail investors. The rumors then shifted to benefit buyers, and the Shanghai Westside bull group again raised the price by 20 yuan. The day closed up slightly by 1 yuan. Total trading volume was 80-90,000 taels. Few sellers of cash gold appeared, and the market price soared. In the morning, Wanfeng sold at 20 taels, with the price 490 yuan higher than futures delivery. In the afternoon, the premium was 510 yuan higher (aggregate price of 7,030 yuan). Demand exceeded supply, with the premium rising by 50 yuan compared to the previous day. Jewelry gold also rose by 5 yuan, to 725 yuan.

Futures Only Decline by One Yuan

Starting at 9:15 AM, each bar (10 taels) opened at 6,550 yuan, 13 yuan higher than last Saturday's afternoon closing price. Yi Da, Xinfeng Yong, and Xiangxing Yong retail investors all bought in, pushing the price up to 6,570 yuan. Defu, Chengji, Yi Yuan, and Li Tai suddenly sold, and large Shanghai Westside groups released significant volumes, triggering a reversal, with the market falling to 2,535 yuan. Later, it briefly hovered around 40 yuan. Remittance merchants Xinfeng Yong and Xiang He bought, raising the price to 6,550 yuan. As the foreign exchange rate returned to equilibrium, Li Tai, Yi Yuan, Defu, Tongkang Yong, and Tianyuan all competed to sell, further lowering the price by 25 yuan, retreating to 6,525 yuan. Chengji and Xinfeng Yong continued to buy, pushing the price up to 6,542 yuan. The morning closed at 6,537 yuan. The afternoon session opened at 2:00 PM, down 12 yuan, at 6,525 yuan. Retail investors sold off, retreating from 6,528 yuan to 6,523 yuan. Xinfeng Yong bought again, and silver house groups also absorbed supply, rising to 6,534 yuan. Upon hearing that US dollars at 5.34375 yuan could be settled again, Gonghe, Jufeng Yong, Rencheng Yong, and other retail short sellers increased selling pressure, dropping the price to 6,519 yuan. Suddenly, favorable rumors emerged, and Li Tai suddenly resumed buying. Xinfeng Yong, Chengji, and Defu aggressively bought, pushing the price up by 24 yuan, to 6,543 yuan. Yi Yuan again sold off, briefly falling to 6,528 yuan. Defu bought again. The market closed at 3:00 PM at 6,536 yuan, only 1 yuan lower than the previous day. Based on the August US dollar settlement price of 5.3125 yuan, it was 6,555 yuan, a reduction of 19 yuan. After closing, it was 6,540 yuan. The overall difference for the day was 51 yuan. The selling price of cash gold from cash houses was 510 yuan higher than futures delivery, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for spot standard gold.

Jewelry Gold Rises Another 5 Yuan

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael was initially quoted by Da Tonghang and Xin Tonghang at 720 yuan, rising by 5 yuan at 3:30 PM, to 725 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 40 yuan.

### US Dollar Futures Rise by One Yuan

### Grain: Good News for Public Food Supply; Brows Slightly Unfurrowed

Large quantities of foreign rice continue to arrive in Shanghai. The Java mail steamer "Chigenekana" arrived last Saturday (the 19th), carrying 1,900 tons of foreign rice, about 19,500 bags, from Java, in addition to a large shipment of sugar. It docked at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong for unloading. The French mail steamer "Dadenan" arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 20th), carrying 4,000 tons of foreign rice, about 41,000 bags, from Saigon. It docked at Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. Jardine Matheson's "Mingsheng" also arrived the day before yesterday morning (the 20th), carrying 15,000 bags of low-priced foreign rice from Hong Kong for the Shanghai Municipal Council. It docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Also, the Thai ship "Xinshengtong" was scheduled to arrive from Siam with rice, but it had not yet arrived as of last night. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai in the next few days. (Zu)

Yesterday, foreign rice prices fluctuated again. This is because arrivals have been abundant recently, inventories have been increasing, new shipments have been arriving continuously, and the Shanghai Municipal Council has also released nearly 1,000 tons at a low price of 138.5 yuan. Furthermore, it is rumored that prices are falling in the production areas, and lower prices are expected. The possibility of public sales at a price of 110 yuan may materialize in the short term. As a result, sentiment has weakened, and selling pressure has increased. No. 1 Saigon fell to 126.5 yuan, No. 2 to 125.5 yuan, and No. 2 to 118.5 to 116.5 yuan. Small-sized varieties were the weakest, falling from 120.5 yuan to 119.5 yuan. High-quality goods were sold at 118.7 yuan, and prices of other rice varieties also declined. Although internal customers showed interest in Jardine Matheson original packages, market sentiment could not be sustained. Small-sized current rice fell again to 146 yuan, with futures at 148.5 to 148 yuan. Siam fell from 140.5 yuan to 139.5 yuan, and broken rice fell from 107.5 yuan to 106.5 yuan, about 1-3 yuan lower than the previous day. Jardine Matheson transacted 6-700 tons, or 12,000 bags of current rice.

Thick and Thin Japonica Rice, Southern Port Rice: Arrivals have been relatively abundant recently, and most are small-scale, with sluggish sales, making it difficult for market sentiment to be sustained, leading to a depreciation of yuan. Fresh high-quality rice opened at 140 yuan, and second-grade at 138 yuan. Wuxi original package Japonica, however, was in short supply, and merchants were reluctant to sell easily. Under sustained pressure, it continued to open at 133.5 yuan and 133 yuan, with no market for second-grade goods.

Glutinous Rice: Extremely sluggish, with thin trading volume and a flat, unremarkable situation. Therefore, market prices have not changed, and opening prices are similar to the previous day.

### Large Quantities of Foreign Flour Expected to Arrive in Shanghai

Yesterday's foreign flour market situation remained in a state of fluctuation. This is because customer sales have been quiet for days, local demand is limited, and foreign firm futures have been arriving continuously, so it is difficult for sentiment to be boosted. The market was quiet, with few transactions. Golden Dragon Flour opened at 31.95 to 31.90 yuan, and Fortress Flour opened at 32.80 to 32.75 yuan. Transactions were less than 5,000 bags. Since the local flour factory suspended supply, market inventories have been thin, with only a few small transactions. The price for battleship flour returning to the market opened at 32.50 yuan, and Red and Blue Car at 33 yuan. The market is brewing.

In other news, a large quantity of foreign wheat flour is expected to arrive in Shanghai this week, about 400,000 bags, shipped from the United States.

Wheat transactions have also been limited. Recent domestic wheat production prices have declined, so there have been some arrivals from nearby areas, mostly directly allocated to Japanese factories. Daily volume is about 1,000 bags, with Japanese factories' retail buying price at 41 yuan, and Chinese factories at about 46-47 yuan. The market situation is weak.

### Oil Cakes: Oil Prices Surge

Yesterday, the speculative atmosphere in the edible oil market remained strong. Most oil merchants have used raising prices to make trades. Buying sentiment was high, and the market rose step by step. As a result, soybean oil rose by another 5-6 yuan, and raw oil and cottonseed oil both rose by 3-4 yuan. 100 barrels of Dasu soybean oil were sold, setting a record price of 196 yuan. 10 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil were sold at 193 yuan, 50 barrels of raw oil at 187 yuan, 200 cans of Jiangbei raw oil at 173 yuan, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil at 133 yuan, and 7,000 dans of Qingyou from Da You Factory were sold for July delivery at 135.5 to 137.25 yuan, and for August delivery at 136 to 138.5 yuan.

However, Indian gunny sacks remained soft, while domestic Hangzhou gunny sacks rose slightly. Original machine-made cloth and 84 cloth were flat.

### The Research Method of History (8)

— Xue Wu Jing

Mr. Liang Rengong said, "Culture is the collective achievement of values created by the mental abilities of humanity." A detailed examination of the word "culture" includes language, customs, ethics, politics, law, economics, academics, literature, art, and religion. Recently, some scholars advocate for the complete acceptance of Western culture, while others advocate for preserving China's inherent culture. The former is too radical, and the latter is too pedantic. In fact, in the more than four thousand years since China established itself as a nation, such as the Northern Wei, Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Manchu Qing dynasties, others have assimilated into us, and we have rarely assimilated into others. All academics, writing systems, and institutions naturally have deep-rooted, unshakable foundations. If they are completely destroyed, how can we establish ourselves in the world? However, I am not advocating for "Chinese learning as the essence, Western learning for practical use," or making absurd comparisons, saying that a certain Western invention is the legacy of a certain Chinese theory. That would be truly ridiculous. I remember Mr. Chen Guofu published an article on the Chinese-centric culture in the Cultural Construction Monthly. His construction is not conservative or blindly following. His attitude is to use scientific methods to review the past, grasp the present, and create the future. Researchers of history should use this standard to liquidate the old culture in history, remove its dross, preserve its essence, and absorb the culture of Europe and the United States, taking its strengths and discarding its weaknesses, to create a new culture, restore the glory of the past, and create a brilliant new China. This is also the attitude that scholars should have. The research method The historical volumes are really too numerous. If we beat the pot to find the candle, rush blindly, have a superficial understanding, and have no clue, then we are just accumulating some dead materials in our minds. What is the benefit of reading it? If we want to turn the dead into the living and transform the rotten into the miraculous, then the research method is also necessary for us.

A. Overview Recently, Mr. Lu Simian said that he read history at the age of eight, and Mr. Hu Shih read "Zizhi Tongjian" at the age of fourteen. If we are determined to study history, we must treat all historical books as novels, limiting the progress every day without interruption. In some places, we may take a cursory glance, and in some places, we must think deeply. With more reading, we will naturally find a way. This is called the overview method.

B. Analysis Life is complex, and things are chaotic. Often, there is a cause in the effect, and the effect is the cause, and the cause produces the effect. Researchers of history, whether it is a book or an event, must thoroughly understand it, with distant causes, recent causes, processes, and results, and understand the impact and changes, so that they can link ancient and modern historical materials into a string. The books of modern representative interpretations are so popular for this reason. This is called the analysis method.

C. Synthesis History is the past activities of mankind. It is whole and systematic. If we only arrange some facts and explain some systems, like the method of chronological history, which makes it fragmented and disjointed, how can we develop our consistent thinking? The body of chronicles and events rose to correct this defect. Objectivists say, "The truth itself is the whole, is the infinite, is the immortal. Any part of the truth is an infinite and finite part, so it is also finite and infinite, perishable and imperishable. Any part is an inseparable part of the whole." This is called the synthesis method. One

D. Comparison In terms of style, old history has differences between biographical chronicles, chronological chronicles, and chronicles of events. Biographical chronicles are based on people, chronological chronicles are based on years, and chronicles of events are based on events. Which is superior or inferior? This is a kind of comparison. Chinese historical works are broad, and foreign historical compilations are refined. Because they are broad, the materials are rich and the clues are complex. Because they are refined, they can use scientific methods to simplify complexity, summarize the main points, and have a clear understanding at a glance.

Historical Tales

### How Did Napoleon Fail?

— Xia Chu

On June 24, 1812, French Emperor Napoleon personally led the "Grand Army" of 610,000 men, with 1,242 field guns and 130 siege guns, across the Niemen River to attack Russia. On the 28th, he captured Vilnius, the ancient capital of Lithuania.

Since Napoleon came to power, the relationship between France and Russia has been somewhat special. The old Tsar Paul I once planned to join forces with Napoleon to invade India. Although the new Tsar Alexander I had joined the anti-French alliance, he also annexed Finland and severed Turkish lands with Napoleon's tacit consent. Napoleon had even intended to marry his sister as his queen. However, the alliance was never made, and the two countries were already at war.

After the two countries went to war, the battle line stretched 600 miles from the Baltic Sea along the Polish border. Napoleon gathered an unprecedentedly large army of more than 600,000 men, of which only half were French troops. The rest were troops from other countries, including Prussian, Austrian, Polish, and Italian troops. The entire European continent, except for Turkey, had joined the war against Russia. On the Russian side, the first line of combat included three armies: the First Army with 100,000 men, the Second Army with 35,000 men, and the Third Army as a reserve force with 40,000 men, totaling 175,000 soldiers and 938 guns. Including the second and third lines, the Russian army mobilized a total of 400,000 men.

The Russian army suffered initial setbacks, and Vilnius fell in a few days. However, Alexander I issued an edict, inspiring the entire country, saying that this was a war of the whole people and that "peace would not be negotiated until all enemy troops had withdrawn from Russian territory." Napoleon entered Vilnius and was welcomed by the local people. He initially intended not to advance further. If he had done so, the entire history of Europe might have been different today. But the Russian army was not far away, and he wondered why not pursue them and wipe them out in one fell swoop? This temptation was too great, and Napoleon could not help but lead his troops deep into the vast wilderness of Russia.

However, he never fought a hard battle with the Russian army. The Russian army kept retreating until Smolensk, where a major battle finally took place. After only a few days of fighting, Smolensk also fell. That day was August 17th. Napoleon originally wanted to stop in Smolensk and not go any further, but he still wanted to force Russia to surrender and he had not yet had a decisive battle with the main force of the Russian army, so he was not happy. He thought that Moscow was Russia's holy city, and the Russian army would definitely defend it with all its might, and then he could vent his anger. So he decided to attack Moscow.

In the small town of Borodino, the Russian army resisted again, resisting very fiercely, and then retreated again in an orderly manner. Napoleon then entered Moscow on September 14th without resistance and resided in the Kremlin Palace.

Moscow originally had a population of 250,000, but now it had all been evacuated. Only 15,000 foreigners, poor people, hooligans, and wounded soldiers remained in the city. Small fires broke out in the city on the night of the 14th, and it was thought to be accidental carelessness. On the 15th, the fire was slightly larger, and on the 16th, the fire was extremely fierce, and the flames illuminated the entire sky, visible from more than ten miles away. The palace where Napoleon lived was also surrounded by fire, so he had to flee to the outskirts of the city like a stray dog to avoid the fire. On the 18th, the fire subsided, and he returned to the city. But what he saw then was that four-fifths of the houses in Moscow had been reduced to rubble.

Moscow in September and October is a time of high autumn skies and refreshing air, the best season of the year. But as autumn came, winter was behind it. How would Napoleon spend the winter? He sent people to Alexander I to surrender, but this young Tsar was willing to eat yams with the serfs, and he would rather let his handsome face grow a beard that he would not shave, but insisted that "peace would not be negotiated until all enemy troops had withdrawn." Napoleon lingered in Moscow for 35 days, accomplishing nothing, and finally ordered the retreat on October 19th.

When the troops retreated, the army's order was very chaotic and discipline was completely abandoned. The Russian army's strength had been replenished and was chasing from behind, and guerrillas were attacking everywhere. At the same time, heavy snow fell and the weather suddenly turned cold. Countless French troops were lost, captured, killed in battle, or died of cold and starvation. By early December, when Napoleon crossed the Niemen River again, he reviewed the remnants of his army and found that he had lost 500,000 soldiers, 150,000 horses, and 1,000 cannons. At the same time, the Russian side lost about 200,000 people.

Although Alexander saw that the French army had completely collapsed, he still did not hold negotiations. He led his troops to pursue relentlessly, chasing them out of the country in January 1813. In October, he and the Allied forces defeated the French army at Leipzig. On March 31, 1814, Alexander entered Paris and declared that he was only an enemy of Napoleon alone, and that France's internal affairs could still be autonomous, so he won the great support of the French people. And Napoleon, the hero of his generation, was turned into a prisoner.

### The Second Landlord's Misfortune

It is said that the biggest harvest of Nazi planes bombing London was "the second landlord's sigh!"

In England, many old people, especially old women, rely on renting out houses to make a living. Mrs. Wagner once told me, "The house is my son." In fact, her son is the subtenant.

In Albert Street in the northwest district of London, known as "Chinatown," there are at least dozens of yellow-faced "sons" supporting their white-haired "foreign mothers." But from last year to this year, you can see that the "for rent" signs have faded, and the yellow-faced sons have long since run away! They dare not stay in these dangerous old houses anymore.

So, the second landlord racked his brains again. As long as you look at the rental advertisements in the newspaper, they all write the same thing:

"This house has a newly built air-raid shelter, very safe."

In fact, many old-fashioned houses in London originally had cellars. What newly built? Due to the strict implementation of population dispersion, the second landlords always can't lift their heads.

On the other hand, Shanghai, which is also in a state of war, has created a second landlord's throne, which makes the old women in London even more angry.

Animals

### Dogs Wearing Shoes

— Ke Zhong

Those who come to Shanghai from the inland for the first time are surprised to see wealthy people's dogs wearing warm velvet clothes and strolling the streets. This phenomenon of dogs wearing clothes is undoubtedly a clear proof of the eastward spread of European customs. It is said that Westerners care for animals in every possible way. In this Anglo-German war, in order to protect their pet dogs, the British not only built special air-raid shelters for dogs, but also made special velvet shoes for dogs to prevent their feet from being injured by glass shards on the road after an air raid. It can also be said that they have thought it through.

### Begonia

— Qin Shou Ou

"How much money can you earn like this! Meng's daughter-in-law is really the most unforgiving on the mouth."

"But apart from these, what else can we girls do?" When Mei Shiran wanted to continue speaking, Zhang Xiaogouzi had tiptoed in, with a very embarrassed expression on his face, as if he wanted to talk to Mei Bao, but when he saw the Meng shopkeeper's daughter-in-law, he swallowed his words again.

Mei Bao, of course, still had these clever tricks. She said all the way, "It's probably someone looking for us! Sorry, good sister-in-law, please help me pour out the medicine!" She walked all the way, and in the blink of an eye, she walked to the outer hall, and at the same time, Xiaogouzi couldn't help but came out.

The Meng family's daughter-in-law really did as she said, and very carefully squeezed the earthenware pot from the stove, and poured all the boiled medicine into a small bowl.

Just when she was considering whether or not she should bring the medicine to Qiu Haitang, Mei Bao had returned, her face flushed red, as if she had drunk alcohol.

"What's the matter?" The Meng shopkeeper's daughter-in-law asked her casually.

"It's the county urging for grain," Mei Bao told her frankly and honestly. "Originally, we had never owed a single penny, but this time, because my dad was sick, we spent a lot of money, and plus the fact that Zhang's family hadn't paid the money for selling three dan of corn a few days ago; right now, my dad is sleeping soundly, and I don't want to open the box to get the money for him, and wake him up. These people will scare the villagers. I went out and said a few polite words to him, and he left with a smile." As she said this, she took out a piece of white paper from a drawer on the side of the table and skillfully covered the bowl of medicine.

"You are a female student, and you speak cleverly, so people are scared to retreat as soon as they hear it!" The Meng family's little housekeeper stood at the side of the table, half serious and half joking.

"Xiaogouzi is really too useless!" Mei Bao replied with a smile. (164)

### Jin Suqin Indicates That Her Interest in the Stage Remains Strong

— Luo

A few days ago, there was news that the famous Kunqu actress Jin Suqin would be leaving the stage. On the evening of the performance of "That's Me" at the Gong Stage, Miss Jin was also watching. We met and talked about this matter. She said, "This is a misrepresentation!" She hoped to have the opportunity to correct it. Here are her words:

"When the Grand Stage decided to perform "Napoleon," they invited me to perform in "Napoleon." I thought, "Napoleon" is a Western-style new play, and I am sure I will not be able to perform it well. You see, the Grand Stage invited me, they must have great expectations for me. Rather than disappoint them after the performance, it is better not to agree. I know very well that if I rashly agree, I will definitely disappoint people greatly. Or it may be because of this that it was misrepresented that I would be leaving the stage. No, I feel a great interest in the stage. In the past two years, because I have not been in good health and there has been no suitable place, I have not performed on stage. Now, I am thinking of doing some activities."

As for what kind of activities, the location, date, and repertoire, she was unwilling to say, saying that "it is too early to announce it now."

### Zhang Cuihong Returns to the Film Industry

— Bao Jun

Everyone knows that Zhang Cuihong and Wang Xichun both emerged in the singing world of the Qinhuai River in Nanjing and were famous in the capital. Later, she was able to achieve today's lofty achievements in the film industry from the background of a singer, which was not accidental. She has her own struggling process.

Zhang Cuihong jumped onto the screen through the introduction of Shen Tianyin. She initially showed her skills in the Yihua-produced "Goddess of Wealth" film, which was a blockbuster. The film industry has been sighing for years about the difficulty of finding talent and the lack of new talent. Therefore, Zhang Cuihong was able to shine on the screen and become famous in the film city, which made people look at her with new eyes and laid her throne in the silver country. After the war, Zhang Cuihong was active in the booming trend of costume films. The beautiful demeanor of "Wang Baochuan," the exquisite posture of "Zhu Yingtai," the solemn appearance of "Guanyin," and the tragic and moving "Qin Xianglian," her acting skills were pure and refined, and she received rave reviews. Her reputation was beautiful, her art improved day by day, and she had already won the elegant title of "Classical Beauty."

After "Qin Xianglian" was completed, Zhang Cuihong, due to busy family affairs and her husband Xu Heng's unwillingness for her to engage in mercury lamp life, hired a lawyer to publish a notice in the newspaper in February this year, stating that due to physical exhaustion, she would retire to her family from now on. But her superb acting skills still made movie audiences miss her. Now news has come that she has finally decided to make a comeback due to the company's repeated requests and overwhelming enthusiasm and return to the film industry to shoot a film. This is good news, and we are here looking forward to her new work being released soon.

### Recent Events in the Film Industry

— Hu Ming

Since Wu Cun's trip to the South, the Guohua Company has been lacking in directorial talent and intends to cultivate new directorial talent. Therefore, it has been decided to entrust Yan Jianong with the sole direction of the film "Lonely Soul in the Black Night." Shooting has now begun, with Murong Wan'er and Xu Feng as the protagonists.

The divorce of "Golden Voice" Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua has not yet been resolved and has become unresolved.

### Casual Talk on the Serial Links (Middle)

— Lao Tu

(2) Dou Erdun

Yuan Shihai Shihai is a red card in Shanghai. Whenever the Serial Links is performed, he always plays the role. With Shihai's "hard work," the performance is colorful and lively, and he gets far more applause than Huang Tianba. The self-introduction "People call me Iron Arhat" when he sits in the stronghold is bold and proud, vividly showing the nature of a hero. A section of fast-paced clapper talk is decisive and enjoyable. Below the horse stealing, the energy is gone, far less than Liu Lianrong. It is said that Shihai has recently become a disciple of Lao Hao, hoping to learn more of Lao Hao's gestures, and promise to overwhelm the group and show off the majesty of the big painted face.

Qiu Shengrong I can't help but "sigh with emotion" when I pick up Lao Qiu. Last year, when I saw him and Li Wanchun perform this play together, everything was at home, from singing to acting to reciting, for up to four hours, in one go, without being discouraged, and he ate up Boss Li. This spring, when he performed with Wang Jinlu, he saw that he was weak. Last month, I watched his performance of "One Entrance and One Palace" with the intention of cheering him on, but I knew that his voice was like a pimp, stuffy and narrow, which was very disappointing. The times make heroes, which made Li Kechang, who "catcalls,"窜 rise. The lack of a Dou Erdun on the stage makes me more sad than the death of a Qingyi!

Liu Lianrong The Bao Erdun that makes me feel most satisfied is Liu Lianrong. The beauty of the hooked face is unmatched. He sings a few yellow bell tunes, and his acting is flexible and clean. It can be worthy of the four characters "perfect match" with Chuan Dewei. From beginning to end, he follows the rules and is meticulous, which is amazing.

Wang Fusheng The Gong Stage also often shows the Serial Links this year. The role of Tianba is played by four or five people, but Erdun is played by Wang Fusheng from beginning to end. When it comes to Fusheng's voice, it is really tasteful, and the martial arts can also pass. The problem is that he is tall but not majestic, and his facial makeup is full of blood but not divine. The so-called "selling appearance" is not working, and he suffers everywhere.

Gao Baisui Gao Baisui cross-dresses as a big face, with Cao Cao in Huarong Road being the most divine, but selling Erdun is also not weak. The appearance is magnificent, and the singing is bold and majestic. Baisui is one who can win a breath for the Southern actors.

### Blood Rain on Fine Jade

— Gu Mingdao

The last two lines of this narrative poem describe how Li Zicheng, after taking Ningwu Pass, gathered his generals to discuss their grand strategy. Although they managed to capture Ningwu in this campaign, their elite troops suffered heavy losses and significant sacrifices, requiring urgent replenishment. Li Zicheng believed that the journey ahead through Datong, Yifu, and Juyong would involve heavily guarded areas. Attacking Yanjing (Beijing) immediately would not be easy. What if the attacks resembled the difficult battle at Ningwu Pass? It would be better to temporarily return to Qin Province, rest, and then plan the next move. Niu Jinxing disagreed. He said, "Now, after enduring great hardships to conquer Ningwu, if we don't advance eastward, wouldn't all the sacrifices of our soldiers be in vain? I believe the defending generals of other prefectures and counties may not all be as loyal and brave as Zhou Yuji. Why worry so much?" Niu Jinxing's words proved to be accurate. Soon, surrender proclamations from Jiang Rang, the general of Datong, and surrender letters from Yifu arrived, greatly bolstering Li Zicheng's confidence, prompting him to resume the offensive. After the fall of Ningwu, Li Zicheng, listening to Niu Jinxing, surprisingly issued proclamations to reassure the people. However, after a night of burning, Ningwu Pass had lost 70-80% of its glory. Many refugees fled, wandering to other lands, some mixed with defeated soldiers. Thus, Xu Jing and Liu Yinying encountered them on the road and received reports from the defeated troops. Upon learning that Ningwu Pass had indeed fallen and that Zhou Yuji's entire family had died for the cause, Xu Jing could not hold back his tears, lamenting, "Heaven is destroying the Ming Dynasty, taking away our Lord Zhou! I regret not being able to die with him and feel deeply ashamed." Liu Yinying said, "Now that Ningwu Pass has been seized by the rebels, our going there would be futile. Let's return to Weifeng Mountain for now and reconsider. I am worried about my sick aunt." Xu Jing hesitated without replying. Suddenly, the fleeing people began to cry out loudly, frantically rushing along the official road behind them, shouting, "The 'Chuang' soldiers are coming! Flee for your lives!" Alerted, the two looked back at the refugees and saw a cloud of dust rising, banners obscuring the sun. A large group of rebels was speeding towards them. Xu Jing said to Liu Yinying, "The rebels are truly hateful! After taking the land, they still hunt down the people." Hearing this, Liu Yinying's eyebrows shot up, and he gritted his teeth, saying, "Good, I haven't fought them yet. When they arrive, I will fight them alongside you, Brother Jing, to our hearts' content, and avenge General Zhou." Xu Jing nodded. The two then allowed the refugees to escape, and waited on horseback for the battle. (End of Chapter Twelve) (121)
