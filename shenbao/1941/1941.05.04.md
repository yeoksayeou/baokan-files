### Pro-German and Anti-British Iraq: Near East War Suddenly Erupts; Iraqi Troops Occupy Important Strongholds and Cut Off Oil Pipelines; Fierce Fighting with British Forces Near Habbaniyah

London: Germany has opened a new battlefield on the path from Berlin to expanding its territory towards Baghdad. At dawn yesterday, pro-Nazi Iraqi troops shelled the British-held Habbaniyah airfield and began fighting with British forces. It is reported that Iraqi forces have occupied important British oilfields and transportation hubs. Iraqi Prime Minister al-Gaylani has appealed to Hitler, asking him to drive out the British. It is noted that in 1915, British forces suffered a major defeat in the conquest of Baghdad, and were bitterly besieged. Habbaniyah is 65 miles west of Baghdad and is an important base for British air patrols over the Mosul oilfields (which are vital to Britain). The shelling of the British airfield began on Thursday. Iraq has been implementing a compulsory military service system for those aged 19 to 25 since 1936. (United Press report on the 3rd)

London: Responsible officials have received reports on the events of yesterday's Iraqi army attack on the Habbaniyah airfield, stating that Iraqi forces first set up a警戒 line around the airfield and dug trenches on high ground, and then opened fire on the British Air Force. The British immediately retaliated against the Iraqi artillery positions, hitting several of their positions with bombs. The fighting is continuing. (Reuters report on the 3rd)

Istanbul: It was learned here today that the oil pipeline from Kirkuk to Haifa, which passes through Iraq and Palestine and is dedicated to transporting crude oil to the British Mediterranean Fleet, has now been cut by Iraqi troops. (Haitong report on the 3rd)

London: British and Iraqi forces have engaged in battle near Habbaniyah, the site of an important British airfield. An official British statement said that British forces took necessary responsive actions yesterday after Iraqi troops opened fire first. The fighting has not stopped all day and is still ongoing. The British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast in Arabic yesterday afternoon, calling on the Iraqi people to drive out the current government. According to London, Iraqi troops concentrated around Habbaniyah, leading to unfortunate clashes with the British troops stationed there. The Iraqi government not only ignored the request to withdraw its troops, but also reinforced its forces on Thursday. Yesterday morning, Iraqi troops opened fire on the British camp, forcing the British troops to counterattack. It is noted that after Gaylani seized power by force a month ago with the support of army leaders, he publicly announced his intention to respect the Anglo-Iraqi treaty. The British government informed him of its intention to open a transportation line in Iraq to transport British troops in accordance with the agreement reached with Iraq a year ago. Gaylani had no objection at the time, and a batch of British troops landed in Basra without encountering resistance. However, a few days later, when the British informed Iraq that another batch of troops was heading to Basra, the Iraqi authorities suddenly claimed that the British troops who had already arrived had not yet crossed the border and that they were unwilling to allow the subsequent batch of British troops to continue entering Iraqi territory. The British insisted on their treaty rights and still sent troops to land in Basra. After that, Iraqi troops concentrated around Habbaniyah in a threatening manner, and the local Iraqi commander sent a strongly worded letter to the British commander in Habbaniyah, stating that no aircraft or troops were allowed to move from Habbaniyah, otherwise they would be shelled. The British ambassador to Iraq negotiated with Gaylani to withdraw Iraqi troops, but to no avail. There is now reason to believe that the majority of the Iraqi people do not approve of Gaylani's anti-British policy and welcome the restoration of the original friendly relations between the two countries. Iraq is rich in oil resources, with pipelines to the Mediterranean. In 1938, it produced 4,272,000 tons of oil. The country has an area of 116,600 square miles. The population was surveyed in 1935 to be just over 3.5 million. In 1932, British trusteeship ended, and Iraq joined the League of Nations as a member. The army was formed in 1938, with a total of 28,000 men, including the air force. There were approximately 10,339 police officers. The king is Faisal II, who is only six years old. He succeeded to the throne in 1939 and is under the regency of his uncle, Ilah. Last month, National Party leader Gaylani launched a coup to seize power, and Regent Ilah fled to Transjordan.

London: According to the Italian official news agency, the Ali government of Nada issued a communiqué stating that British motorized units had attempted to occupy a desert airfield and outposts in the Rutba area of eastern Iraq, but were repelled. Rutba is a grassland in the Syrian desert, about 230 miles east of Baghdad, and is an important outpost on the land and air route from Palestine to Iraq.

According to a Jerusalem dispatch received in London, Arab人士 in Palestine have been listening to broadcasts from a self-proclaimed Baghdad radio station, which gave vivid descriptions of the Iraqi military situation and claimed that disturbances had occurred in Palestine. However, since the residents of Palestine knew that there were no disturbances, they laughed off and disbelieved other news broadcast by the radio station. (Reuters report on the 3rd)

Iraqi Prime Minister Begs for Assistance from Berlin; Goes to the Front Lines to Personally Supervise the Battle

London: The British Broadcasting Corporation recently broadcast a message stating that after Iraqi artillery shelled the Habbaniyah area, Prime Minister Gaylani has requested military assistance from Germany to oppose Britain.

Effective British Response to Various Slanders Against Iraq

London: According to news here, the British government has already prepared plans to deal with any interference with the oil pipelines in Iraq. The claim that any part of the oil pipeline has been occupied has not been confirmed here. It is reported that the status of the Iraqi embassy in Britain is not affected. According to a Rome radio broadcast, the government led by Ali issued a statement stating that the Iraqi authorities had made every effort to avoid accidents, but the British government's political behavior was incompatible with the treaty. The statement also accused Britain of provoking Iraq, and that British troops fired on Iraqi troops, who had no choice but to retaliate. British officials have made an effective response to the above-mentioned slanders in broadcasts to Iraq, pointing out that Ali declared that he would act in accordance with the treaty, while at the same time requesting military assistance from Berlin. Britain had no choice but to take countermeasures. The British communiqué also urged the Iraqi people to overthrow the regime led by Ali. (Reuters report on the 3rd)

Editorial

### After the Outbreak of War in the Near East

Just as the war in the Balkans was about to end, the disasters of war in the Near East unexpectedly broke out yesterday: Under the command of the new anti-British government, Iraqi troops actually shelled the British air force base in Habbaniyah, leading to fierce fighting between the two sides. It is widely rumored that Iraqi troops have occupied the airfield, key transportation points, and oil areas. At the same time, Iraqi Prime Minister Gaylani is said to have requested assistance from Berlin. Regardless of whether the German side will provide assistance or how it will do so, the British army's urgent task is obviously to quickly resolve the tens of thousands of Iraqi troops before German assistance arrives, so as to prevent a small spark from becoming a prairie fire. Therefore, in the next few days, the British army must use the most agile posture to unleash its supreme power to eliminate this army that once received its support but has now turned against it. If it does not, the future evolution of Asia Minor will inevitably add great trouble to Britain.

Investigating the inside story of Iraq's sudden turn, although it inevitably involves some political, ethnic, and even economic unrest left over from past British colonial policies, the incitement and secret assistance of Axis members is undoubtedly the main driving force. As early as the day of the coup in Iraq on May 3, people were alerted to the fact that the fifth column that Hitler had deployed in the Near East had already played a preliminary role. When the British military authorities were very stretched in the Balkan and African wars a few days ago, they suddenly sent troops to land at the port of Basra, probably because they had received secret reports and had to prepare in advance. However, the British troops had not landed for long, and the number was still limited. This time, they were caught off guard and inevitably suffered the disadvantage of "being taken advantage of." Fortunately, General Wavell, the British commander in the Middle East, is an outstanding general. In military terms, he must know how to deal with this not unexpected incident.

As for Germany, if she is determined to provide assistance, the first step can only be to assist in the war by aircraft. If she wants to send an expeditionary army, then the route issue will immediately arise. Assuming that troops are transported by troop ships from southern Greece to land in Syria, they will inevitably be attacked by the British fleet along the way. The difficulty and danger of this matter are exactly the same as the German army's inability to forcibly cross the English Channel. The most ideal solution, of course, is to pass through Turkey and go straight to the Mosul oilfields in northern Iraq. If Germany can gain a foothold in Iraq in the future, not only will Syria be like a turtle in a jar, but Palestine and other places will also fall into its clutches one by one. Finally, it will not be difficult to seize the Suez Canal in one fell swoop to cut off Britain's lifeline in the Red Sea. However, the premise of all this is that the Turkish government is willing to be dominated by Germany, willing to provide the Dardanelles Strait area and even the entire country for the long-term intrusion of Nazi mechanized troops, and willing to abandon the foundation of independence that the late President Kemal had painstakingly built, so as to align itself with the ranks of Romania and Bulgaria. This kind of "concession" may temporarily be exchanged for some benefits (Germany may use Syria as a reward for Turkey's alliance), but what is the difference between this and Bulgaria's division of Macedonia and Hungary's occupation of northern Slovenia? I am afraid that before this "harvest" obtained without effort has been digested, the country's independent sovereignty and the nation's glorious freedom have already been ruined. Is this the fate that the Turkish nation is willing to accept?

In addition, there is an important factor that cannot be ignored, and that is the future direction of the Soviet Union's attitude. According to Japanese propaganda, the Soviet Union and Germany have secretly agreed to divide the Near East, just like the division of Poland last year. However, for the so-called division to be established, both parties must not have disputes over the allocation of the division object. For example, the Iraqi oilfields in question are closest to the Soviet Caucasus. If they are assigned to Germany in the future, Stalin may not be happy to hear it. Assuming that they are assigned to the Soviet Union, wouldn't Hitler be busy for nothing? In case Moscow does not wait for German reinforcements to arrive in Iraq, and takes the initiative by sending troops to Iran to control northern Iraq, and at the same time encourages Turkey to refuse the passage of German troops, then the Soviet-German conflict that the democratic countries have been looking forward to may be inevitable.

### London Attaches Great Importance to the Development of the Near East Situation

London: Diplomatic and military commentators here now believe that British military leaders will deal with the situation in Iraq with strong measures, and warn that the seriousness of the military problem should not be underestimated. They also said that if yesterday's conflict was the prelude to a large-scale operation, Britain's resources in the Middle East will be exhausted. According to recent estimates, the Iraqi army has about 25,000 to 30,000 men, in addition to 12 artillery units, 45 aircraft, and some mechanized units. Their combat effectiveness is said to be ordinary. The British troops in the area, including the famous Gurkha and Sikh units, may be able to cope with the situation in Iraq without further reinforcements. However, diplomatic observers believe that many German officers or other Nazi soldiers have entered Iraq, or far more than Britain suspects. They also pointed out that Britain's important oil pipelines could be in great danger due to the actions of those who are reluctant to work, regardless of whether these reluctant workers are already in Iraq or transported to Iraq by aircraft taking off from the Dodecanese Islands. Commentators strongly stated that in addition to protecting Britain's oil sources, it is also necessary to restore Turkey's faith, and they believe that the British will take strong action to prevent the Germans from indirectly controlling Iraq. People here also fear that the Germans may take decisive action to destroy Iraq's important oil wells and transportation pipelines, or even risk sending a large number of aircraft to achieve this goal. It is reported that the Germans have hundreds of Junkers transport planes available. These aircraft can carry at least 20 soldiers in full gear or a corresponding weight of artillery. In addition, there are new types of giant aircraft that can carry tanks. It is reported that there are at least 100 of these transport aircraft in Libya, and it is also reported that there are some in Greece and the Balkans. The Germans may be prepared to sacrifice these aircraft to land in Iraq during combat, as they did in Norway and the Low Countries. (United Press report on the 3rd)

### To Defend Independence and Freedom, Turkey Does Not Hesitate to Fight; Determination Not to Abandon the Alliance with Britain; Clear Expression from Turkish Leaders; Nine Classes of Reservists Regularly Called Up for Enlistment

Istanbul: "The Yani Sabah newspaper" carried news from the Axis that Turkey had revised its policy toward Britain. Turkish Senator Yalchin recently criticized this, saying that if Turkey is forced to fight for national glory, it will stand on the side of Britain, not because Britain has made this request, but because the ideas and interests of the two countries are the same. Turkey cannot deviate from its friendship and alliance with Britain and join another camp, because if Turkey does so, it would be tantamount to self-abandonment. (Reuters report on the 3rd)

Sofia: Bulgaria predicted yesterday that Turkey would soon join the Axis countries as a friend. Turkish President Ismet recently held secret meetings with senior German diplomats in the Bulgarian capital. It was reported last week that the Turkish President was on a tour of inspection of coastal defenses. (United Press report on the 3rd)

Berlin: German officials said that Ambassador von Papen to Turkey has returned to Ankara after returning home to report on the political situation in Turkey. (United Press report on the 3rd)

Swiss Capital: "The Roman People's News" recently carried a dispatch from a reporter stationed in the Balkan Peninsula, stating that Turkey will soon sign a treaty with the Axis countries. This can be seen from the fact that German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen hurriedly returned to his post after returning home to report to Hitler, and that President Ismet went to inspect defenses in Anatolia and along the Mediterranean coast. However, although President Ismet and Chief of Staff General Chemak do not want Turkey to take any risks, they cannot tolerate any actions that endanger Turkey's interests. We believe that the actions recently taken by Turkish military leaders are of great significance. It is rumored that President Ismet's tour of various places was at the urging of military leaders, so as to prevent the President from feeling surrounded by external dangerous forces, but this so-called external force refers not only to Britain alone. Although the Turkish General Staff approves of negotiations with Germany, it cannot ignore its defense responsibilities due to its responsibilities. In addition, the evacuation of residents in some parts of Turkey has been ordered to stop, which can also be regarded as an important development in Turkey's political situation. (Havas report on the 2nd)

### Ambassador von Papen Stays in Berlin

Berlin: Well-informed sources here stated today that German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen is still in Germany.

### Sixty-Seven Japanese Aircraft Attack Suburbs of Chongqing; Two Hundred Incendiary and High Explosive Bombs Dropped; Five Fires Started, All Quickly Extinguished

Chongqing: Forty-five Japanese aircraft attacked the modern suburbs of Chongqing today, dropping explosive and incendiary bombs, causing considerable damage, but few casualties. Two years ago, on May 3rd, Japanese aircraft also bombed Chongqing, killing five thousand people. The Japanese aircraft arrived over Chongqing at 12:20 PM, shortly after Captain Roosevelt, the eldest son of the U.S. President, had departed for Rangoon by plane. The Japanese aircraft arrived in two waves of twenty-seven and eighteen, concentrating their bombing on two square miles of the modern suburbs, starting five fires and destroying several houses, but the fires were extinguished within half an hour. Two years ago, also on May 3rd, a large number of Japanese aircraft attacked, and at that time Chongqing was not well prepared, with only a few air raid shelters, so the damage was quite severe, with no less than five thousand people killed, leaving obvious and distressing scars on Chongqing. Today, although the Japanese aircraft tried their best to replicate the destruction of two years ago, Chongqing suffered only minor damage. There are extensive and well-defended air raid shelters to accommodate those seeking refuge, so there were only very few casualties reported. The house near where Captain Roosevelt had been staying before his departure this morning was also bombed and caught fire. Captain Roosevelt left here at 10:10 AM, and the air raid alarm was issued at 11:00 AM and ended at 2:00 PM. Within 200 yards of the press dormitory, 40 bombs fell, shattering the windows and walls of the dormitory. Forty thatched huts 100 yards from the dormitory were also set on fire and burned to ashes within twenty minutes. Many 4-type bombs also fell in the shopping area, but the damage caused was relatively minor. Air defense officials said that 75 aircraft participated in the bombing, but observers on the south bank of the Jialing River said they saw 62 aircraft. It is said that about 83 bombers departed from the Japanese base in Hankou. Many bombs fell in areas that had been heavily bombed two years ago. It is reported that two guards at the entrance of a certain air raid shelter were killed. The office of the British Boxer Indemnity Committee was also destroyed. Although the press dormitory was damaged, American journalists still hosted U.S. Ambassador Johnson there tonight, and the restaurant catering the banquet was hit by a small bomb, but the banquet was not canceled. Less than an hour after the bombing ended, workers had already begun repairing the roads and tidying up the power lines, and were watering the bombed areas to prevent dust from flying. Small shops also reopened. Rescue teams also went out to look for the injured, but since they were unable to find any, there were more people playing around in the worst-hit area than those who were sad. (3rd dispatch from Huang Qiao, special correspondent of the United Press)

Chongqing: Thirty-six Japanese aircraft flew over Chongqing this afternoon, dropping about a hundred bombs and incendiary bombs. Several landed in the Lianglukou residential area.

### President Roosevelt's Eldest Son Left Chongqing for Egypt Yesterday Morning; Taking Route via Rangoon, Expected to Arrive in Cairo Next Week; Spoke with Chairman Chiang Before Departure

He said that he trusted that Chairman Chiang and his wife were indeed capable and would be able to lead China through its current difficulties and into success. Roosevelt stayed in Chongqing for four days. During these four days, he also made a trip to Chengdu and went down the Yangtze River, meeting with the highest-ranking Chinese officials. Many Chinese officials and foreign journalists saw Roosevelt off when he departed. He will go to Rangoon and then fly to Cairo from there, expecting to arrive on Wednesday. He said that he had not recorded a list of items that China needed, because Dr. Currie, President Roosevelt's administrative assistant, had already done so recently when he came to Chongqing. Roosevelt also said that he had seen many interesting and valuable things during his stay here, but he would not announce what he had seen. He also said that he had accepted the invitation of the Chinese military authorities to visit Chengdu and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The hospitality of the Chinese was something he had never seen before and he was very grateful. He liked Chinese food very much, especially Sichuan roast duck. He had discussed many issues with Chairman Chiang, but he was unwilling to reveal the details. (3rd dispatch from the United Press)

### Talk of War Between Japan and the United States is Purely False; Japanese Newspaper Believes There are No Unsolvable Problems Between Japan and the United States

Tokyo: The "Chugai Shogyo Shimpo" editorial today stated that there are currently no outstanding issues between Japan and the United States that cannot be resolved peacefully, but this does not mean that Japan-U.S. relations can be quickly adjusted, like Japan-Soviet relations. As for the talk of Japan-U.S. war, it is a dream. Those who make this claim are clearly [text missing - the word should be 'belligerent/warmongering'], because Americans still consider themselves protectors of [text missing - probably 'democratic'] countries. Americans refer to Chongqing as a democratic government, which is simply daydreaming. If [text missing - most likely 'Japan']'s government and people can break this dream, then the Japan-U.S. [text missing - probably 'problems'] can all be solved easily, without the need for Matsuoka to visit the U.S. or President Roosevelt to visit Japan.

### Darlan Re-Goes to Paris to Negotiate with Germany; U.S. Retains Influence in France

Germany is now pressing Marshal Pétain to take actions that he desperately wants to avoid. German opinions are also inconsistent; some advocate for the reinstatement of Laval, while others support Darlan's continued maintenance of the status quo.

### Change of Governors in Gibraltar

The Spanish people did not want war, but Hitler used his well-known tricks to recruit elements similar to "Quislings" in Spain. Therefore, Gibraltar must step up its preparations so that when the enemy attacks Gibraltar from the sea and land, we can annihilate them. The commander of the Gibraltar Fortress is now working at the War Headquarters, which is the first time since the Great Siege of 1779 to 1783, he said.

### The U.S. No Longer Hesitates to Participate in the European War: All Parties Agree That Aiding Britain Requires War

Washington: The government is increasingly considering the possibility of participating in the war, believing that it is the only way to aid Britain. The idea of ​​aiding Britain by "avoiding war" seems to have become a thing of the past. Whether in public or private conversations, it is expressed that everything must be sacrificed to aid Britain. This sentiment is increasing, seemingly wanting the public to think that 40 years after the end of the First World War, the United States can fight Germany again. This movement to awaken the American people and make them aware of the seriousness of the situation is now developing rapidly, making the country truly prepared for war. Observers point out that any senior official who does not mention avoiding participating in the war to aid Britain has been doing so for a week. (International News Service Dispatch, 3rd)

### Random Notes on the European War (50): A New Model of American Diplomat

President Roosevelt's specially selected ambassador to Britain, Winant, is now undertaking one of the most important new roles as America's "overseas eyes and ears." He is not a career diplomat, nor does he rely on a diplomat's salary, and he gets along extremely well with the British officialdom. In these few points, he is no different from his predecessors. However, there are many differences.

For many years, Winant has worked hard to promote the orderly progress of civil society at home and abroad, so the British Liberal Party and Labour Party welcome him no less than the Conservative Party. He believes that today's foreign policy "cannot and should not be separated from social and economic policies." He believes that human happiness can only be achieved through friendly cooperation between countries, and only then can a world be created in the current chaotic international situation, "so that free people can live and work in peace with each other."

Therefore, he is not only a businessman but also a humanitarian. He wants to examine the important changes in British political life and philosophical evolution and report to the American government, so that the future world may gain a clue from this change.

Winant's origin can be said to be the most aristocratic in a democratic country. He came from an elegant colonial family and received the best higher education in his youth. He received an inheritance, and his property increased after his marriage. His hobbies are also what many people wish to keep for life.

He once taught history at St. Paul's School in Concord. He is fond of studying strategy, and he likes to excavate secret materials in American politics. He collects books, oil paintings, Arabian horses, and dogs, and he also loves gentlemanly farming.

Because of his poor eyesight, he was unable to enlist in the last World War, but he managed to join the French Air Force, transferred to the Allied forces, entered and exited the firing line, and took military photographs. When he returned to his country, he had been promoted to the rank of captain. His career has often changed, and he has achieved success in oil extraction, logging, mining, and business.

He could have engaged in these kinds of businesses, but he gave up this comfortable life early on to seek public welfare for the common people. He has studied issues related to worker well-being such as wages, dormitories, nutrition, medicine, working hours, and old-age allowances, and volunteered to do his part. No one seems to know the reason for Winant's such a big change, and it is not easy to explain, is it?

He began to show his characteristics in 1912. It is said that he was one of the three Progressive Party members in Princeton University, and the rest of the students supported Taft or Wilson. Later, in his speech when he took office as the Governor of New Hampshire, he stated his will. He told the Conservative Republicans in the state that he had learned the Republican platform from a Republican member of an internal strife, who told him that the Republican Party originally advocated human rights over property rights.

When he implemented his New Deal in New Hampshire and supported President Roosevelt's new policies in Washington, the Conservative Republicans were not satisfied with him. They could not understand why progressive Republicans across the country mentioned him as a possible candidate for president, and they still do not understand it.

Winant's personality reminds people of President Lincoln of the past. He is tall and straight as an arrow, with hazy eyes, as if in deep thought. He is in his prime of life, speaks somewhat stutteringly, and even when reading a manuscript, he is the same way. He is not particular about his clothing. He wears a dark, loose suit for a long time and lets it wrinkle. His tie is crooked, probably because he ties it while talking. He never brushes the disheveled hair on his forehead. He expresses sympathy everywhere. A hostess in Geneva said, "Winant's entry into the room makes everyone feel refreshed." When he was the director of the International Labour Bureau in Geneva, he received the welcome of at least two important figures in the current British cabinet, one was Labour leader Bevin, and the other was the current Foreign Secretary Eden.

He has the talent to make people respect him, because his respect for people comes entirely from sincerity. He is a patient listener, and he encourages those who visit him in a voice that is almost inaudible, saying, "You know I am not an expert!" He admits his limited talent so frankly. He likes to talk with guests, and a ten-minute meeting can be extended to an hour, so people say that he is not an administrative talent.

He is accustomed to searching for appropriate words when speaking in order to express his meaning, so people say that he thinks slowly. His words are hesitant and easy to deceive the listener. At first, they feel worried for him, and finally they cheer and praise him in the corridor. No matter how clumsy his appearance is, his sincere spirit will emit light.

When he is thinking deeply, he often turns a blind eye and a deaf ear. One day he was talking to someone in his office, he hung a coat on his arm and walked back and forth in the room. Later, the coat fell to the ground, but his thoughts were not interrupted, and he continued to walk, not knowing that his feet were trampling on the coat.

The closer people are to Winant, the less they find him strange. Therefore, the neighbors in Concord all unanimously support him. His party knew about his fascination at Princeton and did not want to nominate him to the state legislature, and he may never be able to enjoy the life of a civil servant. However, his neighbors all supported him. When the competition is fierce and the scores are close, such as the victory over Colonel Knox in 1924, he can at least steadily occupy a majority of fourteen to one in his hometown. Although his state does not approve of the governor's re-election, it has elected him to continue for three times. The British Labour Party's trust in him will surely win over many comrades.

There are many legends about his gentleness and kindness to mankind in Concord. Once he went to an orphanage, and a seriously ill child praised his leather coat. The governor sent someone to give him a leather coat as a Christmas gift on Christmas Day. Another time, when he was about to take a train in New Haven, he found that he was penniless and had no money to buy a ticket. It turned out that he had already spent all his money at St. Paul's School to help a female servant with many family problems.

### Germany Declares That It Is Not Afraid of the United States; The United States Joining the War Will Only Prolong the War

New York: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels met with former U.S. Ambassador to Belgium Kerdache yesterday and told him that Germany has not underestimated the important position of the United States as a world power, but is not afraid of the military impact that will be caused after it joins the war. The United States' participation in the war will prolong the war and make the economic life of the world even more chaotic, but Germany cannot be held responsible for the development of the current German-U.S. relations. Since 1933, Germany has not shown any unfriendly attitude towards the United States.

The President also said that he had not heard of sending a minister to New Zealand, and the detailed mission of his eldest son James' trip to Cairo was also unknown. He asked people to inquire directly with the American naval officers. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

### Jianming Elementary School Resumes Teaching, New Shi Erxiao to Be Judged Next Week

The faculty and staff of Jianming Private Elementary School in Xinling Village, Caishi Road, and New Shi Erxiao Private Elementary School on Weihaiwei Road, Chongqing Road, went on strike from the 2nd due to requesting higher salaries. The education authorities immediately sent personnel to mediate. According to a reporter from Dihua News Agency, the strike at Jianming Elementary School has been resolved satisfactorily. However, New Shi Erxiao is still at a standstill between the school authorities and the faculty and staff, and negotiations will be reopened next Monday.

Jianming Elementary School: The strike at the school occurred at 10:00 AM on the 2nd. The faculty's demands included four items: (1) Increase the allowance by 30 yuan starting in February, (2) Each semester should be calculated as six months, (3) Faculty and staff should not be dismissed without cause, (4) Faculty and staff appointment letters should be issued one month before the end of each semester. After the education authorities sent personnel to mediate, and after earnest consultations, the school accepted the following three items: (1) Starting in May, each person will receive an allowance of 20 yuan per month, and each person will receive an allowance of 5 yuan in April, (2) The salary for this semester will still be calculated as five months, and the salary for the next semester will be calculated as six months, (3) Faculty and staff will never be dismissed without cause. The faculty and staff were satisfied with the above three items and decided to resume teaching today. It is reported that the school also has classes as usual on Sundays.

New Shi Erxiao: The strike at the school occurred on the morning of the 2nd. The faculty's demands, as reported in yesterday's newspaper, were the same. Although the education authorities also sent personnel to mediate yesterday, because the principals and heads of both the school and the faculty and staff were not at the school, they did not get the point and did not start negotiations. It is learned that it has been decided to convene a joint discussion next Monday, so the resolution of the school's strike may still be at a standstill for a short period of time.

### Remembering the Football Lineup of Old Nanyang in the Fifth and Sixth Years of the Republic, Ou Xun

— Ou Xun

Recalling, fourteen years ago, I studied at the Fudan Public School in Li Gong Shrine, Xujiahui, this city, less than half a mile west of the school, which was the former Shanghai Industrial College of the Ministry of Communications (formerly Nanyang Public School, now Jiaotong University). At that time, the principal was Mr. Tang Weizhi from Taicang. Mr. Tang advocated the simultaneous advancement of moral, intellectual, and physical education. Therefore, the Nanyang football team had many talented individuals and was at its peak for a time. It competed with the St. John's football team from Fanhuangdu every year for supremacy in Xupu. Whenever the oranges and tangerines turned yellow and green, the banks of the Xujiahui River were bustling with activity, and tens of thousands of fans rubbed shoulders. I was also a football fan, and every Saturday afternoon, I would go to watch from the sidelines. The dragon fought the tiger, and the blood battle was fierce, which was no less than today's Yiyuan. I only remember the positions of Feng Jianwei and Yuan Qingxiang (nicknamed Flying General), because the distance was far, and the impression was shallower. Nanyang was a neighboring school, and there were countless fellow villagers and friends in the school, so the impression was particularly deep. Although more than 20 years have passed, and people have changed, I still remember the eleven most famous players of the Nanyang football team at that time. Now, I specially present it to provide a smile for the football fans on the sea. Although it is an old event of the Kaiyuan era, it is also an important page in football history. The lineup is as follows:

### Grain: Another 40,000 Odd Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive, Rice Price Only Slightly Lower by 3-4 Yuan

A large amount of foreign rice was transported to Shanghai. The French company opened its ship before (2nd) and arrived in port, transporting a large batch of foreign rice from Saigon, docking at Huashun Wharf for unloading. It was noted in yesterday's newspaper that the exact number of foreign rice loaded by the ship on that day was unknown because the ship arrived in Tanzania late. After special investigation yesterday, it was learned that the ship loaded a total of 27,010 bags of foreign rice, all of which were broken rice. Yesterday morning, Taikoo Company's Yuezhou ship arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, carrying 7,894 bags of foreign rice. The Guangdong ship transported 11,785 bags of foreign rice directly from Siam. Both ships arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession (Zu).

Yesterday's foreign rice market newly established a method in the rice market that can definitely eliminate the practice of kicking the ball and crack down on speculative robbery. The actual transaction between the cargo party and the rice store through the rice distribution company was small, so the total transaction for the day was only about 4,000 bags. New hoarders outside the industry did not get involved, and borrowers did not inquire. The market price immediately followed the normal trend and saw a downstream trend. The road for selling short and buying short remained closed. No. 1 Saigon once shouted 157 yuan, which was settled, and then gradually decreased from 156 yuan to 154 yuan. Xiaowen decreased from 148 yuan to 144 yuan. All other prices followed suit, a uniform drop of 3-4 yuan compared to the previous market. In the future, if Hong Kong rice at parity can continue to come to Shen, and Vietnamese rice continues to come to Shanghai, then the rice market can also be expected to enter a normal track. If there are any previous mistakes, then there are many worries. It is hoped that all parties concerned will seriously implement the measures to create real benefits for the citizens. No. 2 Saigon returned from 150 yuan to 146-7 yuan, the Min Party only 148-9 yuan, Xiaojiao fell from the initial 147 yuan to 144 yuan, and broken tip only opened at 120 yuan and then decreased to 112-3 yuan. The remaining goods could not be traded.

The arrival of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice was still sporadic, but the way out was still more suitable compared to foreign rice. Shops still had the capacity to accept it, and the owners had no intention of easily unloading the goods. Therefore, the market was able to maintain itself and did not change, presenting a stable situation. The listed price for Changbang Qing special japonica was 162-3 yuan, Wuxi japonica was 161 yuan, Su Kun japonica was 160 yuan to 158 yuan, Qingjiao thin indica was 155-6 yuan, and the original package was 161 yuan and 160 yuan. As for rice and glutinous rice, they were not traded due to the constraints of foreign rice.

### American Flour Pours In, Flour Market Rapidly Declines

Flour: The current situation of the foreign flour market, after the rebound from the decline in the market the day before, the situation has shown signs of collapse. The reason is that the rising winds in recent days have been too strong, and a large number of new American flour has arrived, totaling more than 300,000 bags, which has suddenly softened people's hearts. Speculative hoarders ultimately failed to fully maintain their position, and profit-taking bulls came out one after another. Therefore, the Golden Dragon brand immediately dropped to 33 yuan and 1 jiao at the opening. However, it was rumored in the middle that all the unarrived American Can-Australian flour would be delayed and would take time to ship to Shen. This was nothing more than the effect of speculative air, which slightly slowed down the market's decline. It is heard that the market price for Can flour is 33 yuan and 3-4 jiao, and the Flower and Bird brand Australian flour has also returned from 33 yuan and 7-8 jiao to the 34 yuan mark. Other miscellaneous brands have followed suit. Hua Factory's fair-priced flour is 29 yuan, supplied by Fuxin Factory with more than 5,000 bags. The insufficient amount is still supplemented by extracting foreign flour.

Wheat: The domestic wheat market, after being agitated by the rising winds in the flour market, the asking price has reached 51-2 yuan. However, due to the lack of spot goods, it has not been officially traded. Yesterday, the flour market declined rapidly after rising, and Fuxin Factory has received a ship of Can wheat, totaling 105,000 bags, which can produce 300,000 bags of flour for fair sale in the city. Therefore, Hua Factory no longer considers domestic wheat for raw material needs, and will wait for the new wheat to be launched before deciding whether to advance or retreat according to the environmental situation.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Oilcake Slightly Stabilizes After Two Weeks of Consecutive Gains

Oilbean Cake: It is no longer as crazy as it was in the past two days, and people's enthusiasm has also calmed down. The reason is nothing more than that the prices of all goods have soared for two weeks, and hoarders have made huge profits, so the intention to release the goods has been fully revealed. Today is Father's Day, so there is a potential trend of waiting for future changes. It is estimated that Dalian soybean oil fell by 1 yuan per standard, with the price opening at 185 yuan and 50 barrels traded. Soybean cake fell by 5-6 jiao, with 15-16,000 pieces of Shengji futures cake traded at a price of 22 yuan to 22 yuan and 1 jiao for the upper half of May, 23 yuan and 5 jiao to 26 yuan for the lower half of May, and 24 yuan to 23 yuan and 5 jiao for the upper half of June. The current price of Dada four-brand cake is 21 yuan, with 1,000 pieces traded. Yuanlong traded 3 cars for the lower half of May at a price of 21 yuan and 7 jiao. Changji traded 2,000 pieces for the lower half of May at a price of 20 yuan and 5 jiao, and 1,000 pieces for the lower half of May at a price of 21 yuan. Yuanji traded 3,000 pieces for the lower half of May at a price of 21 yuan and 6-7 jiao. There are also Hankou cakes that were previously thrown out for delivery at the end of April. Now, due to the lack of goods for delivery, it is heard that the price will be settled at 18 yuan, and both parties have completed the formalities. The current price of corn has fallen by more than 1 yuan, and the futures price has fallen by about half a yuan. The rising wind of soybeans was a flash in the pan, and it remained stable yesterday. 300 bags of Qingdao beans were traded at a price of 50 yuan, and more than 2,000 bags of Guizhou beans were traded at a price of 48 yuan. The listed price of Tianjin beans was 50 yuan. In addition, 50 bags of green beans were traded at a price of 48 yuan. Furthermore, there are 1,220 bags of soybeans today (4th) to be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Finance: Exchange Market Turns, Chinese and Western Merchants Sell in Succession

Foreign Exchange: Yesterday's market situation, HSBC's listed prices for each exchange rate did not change. The black market for British and American exchange rates turned loose and cheap. The US exchange rate of 5.125 yuan has been difficult to break, and the European war is unfavorable to the UK. The United States will further freeze the world's funds. Hua Bank and speculators have started selling in succession. HSBC has even turned to absorb and release, with the British exchange rate seeing 3 pence 21875 and the US dollar 5.1875 a loose price. Finally, it slightly recovered due to the better intention of other foreign banks. The closing price was 3 pence 203125 for the British gold and 5.15625 for the US dollar, a British loss of 015625 and a British gain of 03125. There were few transactions in the first half of the day, and there was no market on Saturday afternoon.

The opening price of the domestic market was the bank's selling price, with the spot British exchange rate at 3 pence 1875 and the US dollar at 5.125. After opening, the British exchange rate immediately hardened to 3 pence 20125, which could be settled. Hua Bank sold the May period to HSBC for 3 pence 21875, and the US exchange rate could also be settled at 5.15625 amidst the selling wind of speculators. It was even sold to HSBC for the May US dollar at 5.1875. HSBC's listed prices for each exchange rate did not change. After the silver balance tax was still levied at 24.50%, the US dollar at 5.1875 for this month was once difficult to sell and could be settled, and the British gold at 3 pence 21875 could also be purchased. However, soon, foreign banks saw that the intention to accept cheap goods was slightly better, and the speculative intention to sell turned weaker, so it was seen to soften. HSBC issued a US dollar at 5.12625 for this month from a certain bank, and the market trend later stabilized. At noon closing, the spot and June period were both 3 pence 203125 for the British exchange rate and 5.15625 for the US dollar, a British loss of 015625 and a British gain of 03125 compared to the closing price of the previous day.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Drops Alone

### Gold Market Downstream as All Parties Dump, Retreats to the 6,700 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's gold market was dark and the black market turned downstream, with the price retreating to the edge of the 6,700 yuan mark. People's hearts in all directions turned tired. The European war developed and the US exchange rate also loosened with the British gold, and news of the United States implementing a freeze on the world's funds was rumored. Therefore, under the successive selling momentum of securities firms, gold firms, silver firms, and exchange bill merchants, the price stepped back from 6,740 yuan to 6,701 yuan. It was pulled up by scattered shorts entering, ultimately squeezing down a small 28 yuan. The total transaction for the first half of the day was 16,700 taels. There was no market on Saturday afternoon. Jewelry gold, customs gold, etc. were all flat, and cash also saw a decline. Yongfengyu issued 100 taels at a price 130 yuan higher than the futures transaction price. Xianghe issued 100 taels, 110 yuan higher. Both were bought by Dofu. At the last moment, Shihe issued Xiangxingyong 50 taels, 120 yuan higher, which also squeezed down about 30 yuan.

Dark Red Returns Down 28 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (10 taels) was quite stable at first. The market opened at 6,735 yuan at 9:15 AM, 3 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. Next was 6,740 yuan. Dafeng, Chi Da, Hengji, Dofu, and retail investors sold vigorously. It was heard that the May US dollar at 5.15625 could be settled, and the price suddenly fell to 6,715 yuan. It was absorbed by Xinfengyong, Chengji, and Xianghe, and raised to 6,725 yuan. The May US dollar hardened to 5.1875, making it difficult to sell. Dafengyufengyong and Dofu came to release again, and it fell by more than 20 yuan, falling to 6,701 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange stopped loosening and slightly recovered. Xinfengyongxiang and He Lijin raised the price to 6,718 yuan. At noon closing, it was pressed down to 6,710 yuan, 28 yuan lower than the previous day. The settlement price for the May US dollar at 5.15625 was 6,754 yuan, which was 44 yuan less. After closing, it retreated to 6,707 yuan, and finally 6,710 yuan. There was a difference of 39 yuan in the first half of the day. There was no trading outside the market in the afternoon. The selling price of cash firm's own brand gold was 130 yuan higher than the dark red futures trading price, and the buying price was 70-80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no market for the current standard gold price.

Jewelry Gold Exchange Price Remains Unchanged

The exchange price for jewelry gold in silver shops is still listed at 705 yuan per tael, with a reduction of 40 yuan for buying back.

### American Notes at 19 Yuan, Enter and Then Exit

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, the dark red market price trended weak. British and American gold pounds also fell by 1 yuan each. British gold notes remained stable as before, and the market price stood flat. American gold notes once broke through the 19 yuan mark, ultimately closing at 19 yuan and 1 fen, a squeeze down of 5 fen compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes had even supply and demand, and the market price stood flat. Japanese gold notes still stood at the original price of 2 yuan and 9 fen. Korean notes had a slight supply, and the market price loosened. The evening market retreated to 1 yuan and 8 jiao and 3 fen.

Securities: Public Debt Does Not Escape Sideways Trading

The black market for public debt, yesterday's market situation still did not escape the sideways trading situation. There were many bulls emerging on the table, and the situation was still tired and unable to rise. There was no improvement in the market transaction, and buying and selling were not enthusiastic. The idle and dull state may not be easy to develop for a while. Therefore, the public debt market is temporarily more deserted. Yesterday was Saturday, and only half a day of trading was done. Tong Kang Lianhe bought Type C, and Shunchang Renchang bought Type E. Therefore, Types C and E were once raised by 2-4 jiao. However, Lianhe came to sell Type E again, and the supply of the remaining companies, such as Jiucheng Lianyi Runli Dunyu Xinfu, was endless. Although Renfeng Delong still had capacity, the supply was already felt to be greater than the demand, so it returned a small 2-3 jiao. Type D opened, but Type A failed to be traded. The results of the market situation were mixed, with mostly declines and fewer gains. The transaction volume was estimated to be about 8-900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Category Highest Lowest Closing Price Compared to Previous Day

Shares: Transactions, 100 shares of Dachina Dachai Company were traded at a price of 34 yuan.

London, 2nd (Friday) Telegram: Today, the foreign prices of Chinese and various East-British companies' stocks on the Tsai listing market showed a decline again.

Fick's Jinpu Yuanxu and Guangjiu each fell by 1 pound, Fick's at 7 pounds to 9 pounds, Jinpu Yuanxu (both original and continued issues) at 10 pounds, and Guangjiu Railway at 9 pounds. In addition, the British stock Kaiping Coal Mine unregistered stock also fell by 1 shilling and 6 pence to 16 shillings and 6 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn Flowers: Profit-Taking Emerges, Yarn Market Returns Looser, Actual Sales Have Reported Declining, Money Market Also Slightly Tightens

The yarn market started high and turned flat, but the trend is slightly stable. This is because the continuous rise has already caused a large degree of increase, causing profit-takers to emerge, with the table slightly looser. At the same time, actual sales are not as smooth as the previous day due to the weekend, which makes people's hearts carry flatness. Currently, the general discussion in the market is that if the 1,600 yuan mark fails to break through, there may be a 30-40 yuan pullback, and the price of 1,550 yuan may be seen before dragging in again. However, the amount of multiple and short transactions remains prosperous and frequent. The former changes are still in multiple events. The high price for 20-count yarn was 1,585 yuan and the low price was 1,563 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the weekend relationship, people's hearts were scattered, and the transaction price for a small number of transactions was 1,563-4 yuan. According to the reasons for being optimistic about the market some days ago, it is said that the Shuangma Factory has 26-27,000 packs on a single basis, which has been gradually reduced recently, leaving only 17-18,000 packs. Therefore, there are more who buy and fewer who sell. How the future will be is difficult to predict. Today, there were 1,320 pieces of cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong.

Shuangma opened in the morning. Because the market situation was quite beautiful on the afternoon of the previous day, the popularity was enthusiastic, there were more buyers and fewer sellers, and the table atmosphere was very tight. The shouts were loud. The first round price was 1,580 yuan. Due to the tense situation, it rose to 1,585 yuan shortly after. At this time, when the price was high, it caused a large number of multiple orders from the securities gang to emerge. Once the chips loosened, the market fell back to 1,566-7 yuan. This price circulated for a long time. It is said that the money market has tightened and there is a tendency to hold back. There were some ups and downs in the middle, and it rose back to 1,571 yuan. Ultimately, the closing price was 1,565 yuan because the current yarn transaction was not as prosperous as the previous day and people's enthusiasm turned light. After investigation, the transaction statistics for the half day were 8,010 packs. The amount bought by each gang is listed separately as follows:

Hong Kong 650 Inland 360

With Yarn Flat and Tired, Cotton Sales Turn Light

The situation of current cotton. It was colorful by tracking the yarn market the day before. All Chinese and foreign factories had considerable needs, and people's hearts were excited for a while. However, the amount of cotton transported from overseas was very large. Therefore, the market trended light again yesterday. This is because the yarn market was flat and tired in the morning, and the factory was not interested in purchasing goods, and it was also Saturday. The household transactions made by each company yesterday are listed on the left.

US Medelin 417 Synergistic Xing 200 Pieces, Warehousing

US Pennsylvania 324 C Chang 300 Pieces, Warehousing

Indian Rangoon Flower 3 Shunxingchang 100 Pieces, Warehousing

Another message from Shanghai's foreign cotton trading. There were not many transactions, but colleagues still saw the market high due to the good current yarn situation. Yesterday, Yongan also imported 650 bales of Indian cotton Huisi Deng, and Shenxin imported 200 bales of Pennsylvania. The market price was about 330 yuan.

The New York cotton market first rose due to the entry of peers and Wall Street, and then fell back due to the closing of profits by all parties. As a result, the closing price was about 2 pounds higher than the previous day.

Also, the US cotton statistics from August 1 of last year to May 2 of this year are recorded on the left (500 pounds per bale).

Cumulative Listing 10,497,000 bales

Cumulative Factory Use 7,847,000 bales

Cumulative Exports 889,000 bales

To Japan 95,000 bales

To China 51,100 bales

To the United Kingdom 36,000 bales

To Germany 149,000 bales

Stocks in Various Ports 6,155,000 bales

The Indian cotton market was quite weak, and it felt weak due to the selling of European exporters and the closing of profits. The closing prices fluctuated by 1-2 rupees.

Also, the predicted opening market situation today is seen as high by 0.25 rupees.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Passenger Sales Are Still Active

Factory Cloth: The market was stable yesterday, and colleagues' entry and exit turned lighter. Cantonese and Hong Kong merchants continued to take in passengers, and retail purchases from this street and various inland routes were still frequent. The selling of fine cloth and fine twill was mixed, with hand goods slightly cheaper by 1-2 jiao. Coarse cloth and group twill were firm, and a part of the scarce goods rose by 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half. The general market for bleached and dyed cloth was flat. This street transacted more than 300 pieces of various cloths, and the Cantonese and Hong Kong merchants handled more than 200 pieces of twill colored cloth and colored twill, etc. Singapore, Siam, and other places purchased 4-5,000 pieces of printed cloth, bleached cloth, and twill, etc.

East Cloth: Yesterday's market had extremely minor rises and falls. The leading white cloth and fine cloth now revolves around 51.7-8 yuan in the warehouse list, and the closing price at noon was 51.7 yuan, a drop of 5 fen. Colorful ball fine cloth rose by 2 jiao, flying fish fell by 2 jiao, and fine twill was as stable as ever. Serge fell first and then rose, and there was not much honor or disgrace. The Huang warehouse list was sold at 1 yuan, 6 jiao, 1 fen, and 2 and a half li.

Exports: Today (4th), there are 1,440 pieces of cotton cloth to be shipped to Hong Kong, and another 995 pieces to be shipped to Yangon.

### White Serge Supply Exceeds Demand

White serge is extremely scarce in this summer market, especially East goods. High-end West goods of more than 40 yuan still have supply, but ordinary and lower-end goods are non-existent among colleagues. Therefore, buyers have no choice but to equip themselves with high-end goods. According to East goods, high-end goods are scarce and there are more lower-end goods. Lower-end goods have quite a lot of jumps and are not clean, and they are also light and thin, so customers do not look at them at all. Yesterday, the British-made No. 1 white serge was generally sold at 46-7 yuan per yard, the deputy number was 42-3 yuan, the East goods No. 1 was 33-4 yuan, the ordinary was 28-9 yuan, and the lower-end secondary number was 23-4 yuan.

### Sugar Market Sugar Prices Rise Sharply, Then Fall Slightly—Profit-Taking After Exceeding Limit Prices—

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a sharp rise for several consecutive days. Spot and coarse white sugar prices all exceeded limit prices. Many long positions took profits, and there was some selling pressure, leading to a slight pullback. The guild's quoted price for spot #24 coarse white sugar was 24 yuan. Foreign godown prices were 113 yuan 7 jiao in the morning and 113 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen in the afternoon. The May 10 futures contract had risen by about 12 yuan on the 1st and 2nd. Yesterday morning, it was 116 yuan to 112 yuan 4 jiao, and in the afternoon, 113 yuan 5 jiao to 2 jiao, closing at 114 yuan 9 jiao, down 2 yuan 6 jiao. The May 20 futures contract was 117 yuan to 113 yuan 8 jiao in the morning and 114 yuan to 115 yuan 9 jiao in the afternoon, down 3 yuan 6 jiao. Dutch red sugar remained tight, initially at 87 yuan 5 jiao, rising to 88 yuan to 89 yuan, and 88 yuan in the afternoon, up 10 yuan from the low of 84 yuan. On the previous day, Taikoo Granulated B mark was priced at 120 yuan for Western godown stock, while yesterday, Eastern godown stock was 116 yuan, down about 3 yuan. DY mark was quoted at 107 yuan, and HX mark at 106 yuan for Western godown stock. There were 200 bags of sugar arriving from Hong Kong three days ago.

### Coal White Coal Prices Rise in the Gray Market

Hongji white coal has been arriving recently and is not unpopular. Several ships arrive each month, but mostly with coal dust, causing lump coal prices to be exceptionally high. Brokers and industry insiders report that while the official price remains at 370 yuan, this is limited to two baskets. To purchase larger quantities, one must search the market for old orders from hoarders, and the gray market price is 60 yuan higher than the official price, causing great confusion among the shops on this street. Screened lump coal delivered to customers costs 460 yuan per ton, it is said.

### Dried Goods Though Hainan Dried Longan Rises, Dealers Are Willing to Sell All Stocks

Hainan dried longan has been scarce recently. Although prices have gradually increased by 30-40 yuan, dealers have not been willing to sell all their stocks. Yesterday, prices were raised by another 5 yuan, and traders are observing the market and have not entered. If they persist, a deal will surely be made.

### Metals Pig Lead and Huisi Iron Remain Firm and High

The market for pig lead and Huisi iron has appeared quite firm recently. Due to continued demand from canneries and printing factories on this street, the market is lively, boosting the confidence of traders. Prices have remained very firm. Yesterday, each 200-pound case opened at 370 yuan, up 5-6 yuan from before. It is said that the total transaction volume for the day was about 140-150 cases. Because the overseas supply of these goods is not continuous and local inventories are limited, holders of goods are increasingly bullish and reluctant to release large quantities in wholesale transactions.

### Sundries Soap Continues to Rise

The soap price surge is unstoppable. Speculators and hoarders are sparing no effort to purchase and hoard, causing prices to rise repeatedly. Current market prices include 59 yuan per case for Goben Soap from Xiaoshadu Road, 52 yuan per case for Baixiangmao Soap, 48 yuan per case for Huangxiangmao Soap, and 46 yuan per case for Arrow Soap. All have risen sharply compared to last week. Speculative sentiment is strong, and prices are still expected to rise.

### Coordinating People's Food Supply and Suppressing Market Prices Hong Kong Rice Prices Determined Rice Shops to Sell at 110 Yuan per Shi Rice Merchants Directly Ordering Restricted The Authority's Plan to Control Rice Supply in the City Gradually Takes Shape

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement has completed the procurement of Hong Kong Kang price foreign rice. The first batch of 5,000 tons has already been shipped from Hong Kong and will arrive in the coming days. Yesterday, sources at the Municipal Council revealed that the selling prices of the foreign rice have been determined by the authorities as follows: (1) The Municipal Council sells to merchants at 122 yuan 9 jiao 1 fen per bag; (2) Merchants sell to rice shops at 133 yuan 5 jiao per bag; (3) Rice shops sell to citizens at 110 yuan per shi. It is understood that the profit margin for merchants is 5% to 10%. Merchants are required to pay 30% of the purchase price to the Municipal Council as a deposit when ordering, and the full amount is due upon delivery. It is said that many rice merchants have registered and applied to sell the rice. It is also understood that the first batch of low-priced foreign rice purchased by the French authorities has been shipped from Annam, but the exact date of arrival is unknown.

Hong Kong Rice of Superior Quality

Foreign rice is divided into #1 and #2 Saigon rice and small broken rice. Saigon rice is better, but small broken rice is also quite edible, only the grains are smaller. The two municipal authorities of the settlements have announced that a large batch of patterned rice shipped from Hong Kong and Vietnam will arrive in Shanghai within two weeks and will be sold at 110 yuan per shi. However, the price of #1 Saigon rice in Shanghai is still 155 yuan per shi, as speculative rice merchants are still waiting and watching. It appears that they will only be willing to comply after the rice has actually arrived in Shanghai. Citizens of the two settlements have stopped buying high-priced rice from retailers in the past two days, but laborers who buy and eat rice as they go are suffering. Therefore, those with surplus grain should refrain from buying rice for the time being, which would also curb the rampant activities of rice speculators.

Chartering Ships Most Important

An editorial in the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* stated that the Municipal Council's plan to ship rice from Hong Kong to Shanghai, having secured the necessary ships for implementation, is a major blow to speculators. There is no actual shortage of rice in the city at present; the only problem is the unavailability of low-priced rice. The culprits responsible for this situation are those who hoard large quantities of rice in order to profit from speculation. If the Municipal Council can ship rice to Shanghai and control rice prices to maintain a reasonable level, the rice currently hoarded in warehouses will be released for sale at lower prices. Since the Municipal Council sells rice at 110 yuan per shi, no one will be willing to buy rice from speculators at 150 yuan per shi. Moreover, even if speculators sell their hoarded rice at 110 yuan per shi, they will still make a profit and will be happy to sell it. Therefore, the price of rice in Shanghai will surely fall to a reasonable level. Furthermore, the Municipal Council's current regulation that all rice shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai in quantities exceeding 2,900 tons must be purchased and sold exclusively by the Municipal Council, and that the Hong Kong government will no longer issue permits, is extremely important. This will subject rice merchants to control and prevent them from engaging in illegal activities.

Rice Speculators' Arrogance Begins to Subside Yesterday

Business transactions among rice merchants in the rice market have become impossible after the Market Management Committee took emergency measures. Illegal transactions have gradually disappeared. All rice transactions made by rice merchants and customers in the market now require both the buyer and seller to issue a transaction slip, which is then taken to the "Public Notary Office" by the rice broker who facilitated the transaction to be stamped. Under close supervision in many aspects of yesterday morning's market, speculators seemed to have exhausted their tricks. Fearing a sharp drop in rice prices after the arrival of low-priced rice in Shanghai, they gradually supplied their hoarded goods to the market. At that time, the supply of spot goods increased slightly, and rice shops became less willing to buy. As a result, the price fell by about 4 yuan compared to the previous market price.

Brokers' Actions Worth Noting

The Rice Brokers Association issued a public notice to the rice market yesterday stating that all members must wear their badges and use the Association's standard brokerage slips when conducting business. This has long been the regulation. Given the current period of rising rice prices, members will temporarily take turns entering the market for brokerage on a daily basis in shifts of half. They must also deposit their Grain Guild certificates with the Association in order to prevent afternoon trading. They are requested to submit their Grain Guild certificates between 9:30 and 10:00 AM each day and pick up the Association's badge, returning the original certificate after 11:00 AM. Late arrivals will be considered as abandonment. In addition, the 35th Notice was issued stating that members' living expenses are increasing daily, and the brokerage commission has been increased to one jiao per bag in national currency. All non-members are required to register and join the Association within one week to obtain a badge and enter the market for brokerage. It is understood that there are currently over 110 brokers in the rice market acting as intermediaries for rice shops, all of whom are members of the Rice Brokers Association and hold badges issued by the Association. However, the market is already crowded, and it is difficult to understand why the Association is still recruiting non-members.

600,000 Bags of Flour Shipped to Shanghai

Shanghai's flour supply is being continuously shipped from the United States on American cargo ships, so there is no fear of shortage. On the 2nd of this month, the American cargo ship "Loganberry" (transliteration) arrived from the United States with 400,000 bags of flour. According to the American shipping company, another American cargo ship named "American" (transliteration) will bring 250,000 bags of flour to supply Shanghai merchants next week. Both of the above-mentioned cargo ships sailed from Seattle to Shanghai in October. Afterwards, the cargo ships will continue to travel between Europe, Asia, and the United States, carrying flour and other goods. The Shanghai Municipal Council continues to order flour merchants to sell flour at lower prices in order to ease the livelihood of the people.

### British War Time Fund in Shanghai Nears Two Million

According to yesterday's news, the British War Time Fund in Shanghai has reached nearly two million yuan. This is because more than 30,000 yuan were donated last week, bringing the total to 1,988,000 yuan. The largest donation last week came from "KYZI," totaling 1,021 pounds, 6 shillings, and 4 pence in British currency. The largest individual donation was from Mrs. Tao Si Paulo, totaling 4,000 yuan in legal tender. The Taikoo Company and the Oriental Paint Company jointly donated 1,101 yuan and 6 jiao.

Tianxiang Employees Dedicate Fighter Plane

It is understood that the employees of the British trading company Tianxiang Yanghang and its branches throughout the Far East, sympathizing with the British war effort and hoping for an early victory, launched a fundraising campaign to purchase a fighter plane to present to the British government. Since the launch of the campaign, the Chinese and Western employees of the company have enthusiastically contributed, and have already raised enough funds to be remitted to London to purchase a Spitfire fighter plane for the Royal Air Force. It is reported that the British Air Minister Sir Beverbrook Lorne has telegraphed the Hong Kong General Manager of the company, Mr. Tao Daweier, to express his gratitude. It is said that each Spitfire fighter plane is worth at least 5,000 pounds.

### New American Cargo Ship Cape Alava Maiden Voyage to Shanghai Arrives Tomorrow and Proceeds to Hong Kong Thereafter One Ship Every Two Weeks

The new American Mail Line cargo ship *Cape Alava* sailed from Seattle on its maiden voyage via Tacoma and Vancouver and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 5th of this month. The ship is the first of a new type of cargo ship built by the American Mail Line, with a speed of 14 knots and a cargo capacity of 7,000 tons. In addition, the company's new ship *Cape Flattery* is also scheduled to sail from Seattle to Shanghai in mid-month. The American Mail Line currently sends a ship every two weeks to travel between Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. It is expected that more ships will be added to this route within the year. Its Eastern management office is the Flood Line Shipping Company.

### National Medicine Raises Prices to Improve Employee Benefits Aid Should Be Given to the Poor and Sick Who Cannot Afford Medicine French Concession Garbage Workers Cause Trouble Again

The French Concession Public Works Bureau employs approximately 700 garbage collectors, including 46 "A-type" temporary workers. Due to unfulfilled demands for improved benefits and increased wages, a general strike broke out on the morning of October 27. By November 1, negotiations were completed, and the wages of all workers were increased by 30%. The workers declared the strike successfully resolved and resumed work on the same day. However, the Public Works Bureau dismissed all 46 "A-type" temporary workers who had initiated the strike.

Garbage Workers Salary Deduction Dispute

At 1:00 PM yesterday, some of the workers who had resumed work suddenly went on strike again and incited others to engage in slowdowns. The reason was that they did not want the French Public Works Bureau to deduct three days' wages for the strike period and demanded that they be paid in full. The dismissed "A-type" temporary workers also demanded to be rehired and allowed to resume work. As a result, many workers gathered in front of the engineering office at the intersection of Route Doumer and Rue Massenet to await news of the negotiations. The French police, upon receiving the news, immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to suppress the workers and disperse them. It is reported that five or six workers who caused trouble were arrested. Fearing that the workers would cause further disturbances, the police dispatched Chinese, Western, and Vietnamese detectives to guard the engineering office to prevent incidents.

National Medicine Industry Improved Treatment

The case of national medicine workers demanding improved treatment has lasted for more than half a month. Fortunately, both sides were able to understand each other, so a strike did not occur. The representatives of both labor and management negotiated again the afternoon before yesterday, and a satisfactory resolution was reached. The conditions agreed upon by both labor and management are as follows: (1) Salaries will be increased by 140% of the original contract level as a living allowance. (2) The original rice subsidy will be changed to a special allowance and divided into two types: Heye Hall and Xinyi Hall. Heye Hall will be divided into four levels: special, A, B, and C. The special level will receive 26 yuan per month, A 20 yuan, B 14 yuan, and C 8 yuan. Xinyi Hall will be divided into four levels: A, B, C, and D. Level A will receive 16 yuan per month, B 13 yuan, C 10 yuan, and D 7 yuan. If there are grades better than the above, all will be increased by 50%. (3) Monthly regulations will be 4 yuan per month uniformly. (4) All the above conditions will be implemented in May. The capital also took the opportunity to raise prices, increasing the fees for drugs sold in stores by 20%. However, the prices of national medicines have risen greatly since last year, and the business of this industry has flourished recently. The salary increase should not be difficult to compensate for, so there is no need to increase the burden on patients, which is despised by society. Special care should be given to the poor.

Business Colleagues Petition Today

Since the assistant manager, Li Bojia, came to Shanghai and announced that all the requested conditions had to be decided by the board of directors, representatives from the factory and the publishing house will each send three representatives today to petition the directors, asking them to quickly resolve the urgent situation to avoid serious problems. Moreover, at this time and in this situation, both parties should work together to overcome difficulties. It is said that the board of directors will hold a strike in a day or two, hoping that the future will be resolved through reasonable means.

Machine Model Labor-Management Agreement

Workers in the machine model industry have requested an increase in wages. Labor and management have reached an agreement, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Wages are divided into two types, A and B. Type A workers, those earning 1 yuan or more per day, will receive a general increase of 50% of their original wage. Type B workers, those earning 1.5 jiao or less per day, will receive a general increase of 60% of their original wage. If the price of rice rises to 180 yuan, wages will be renegotiated. (2) The rice subsidy will be 3 jiao per person per day. If the price of rice exceeds 130 yuan, an additional 2 jiao will be added for every 20 yuan increase. (3) The wages of short-term workers will be increased by 30% of the original price. Workers shall not be dismissed without cause.

### Shen Qiquan Declines Birthday Celebrations and Writes to His Nephews to Express His Aspirations

Shen Hongquan, a historian from Yuanhu and a respected figure in the Hanlin Academy, will be 80 years old on the 9th day of the fifth month this year. His nephews and nieces requested to offer him congratulations, but he firmly refused. Recently, it was reported that he wrote a letter to his nephews and nieces, refusing their birthday greetings. The sentiments expressed were sincere, and the literary style was excellent and worthy of being read. It has been copied here. The letter reads: "I am now eighty years old. Gentlemen in my hometown want to celebrate my birthday, but I have firmly declined. My children and grandchildren are planning ways to entertain me on this day, but they have not understood my intentions, so I am writing this letter to explain. Our country is suffering from war, and it may not end in five years. The war in Europe is expanding, and countless people are donating their lives and brains. How can I celebrate my birthday in peace? My ancestors were honest officials. For decades, I have viewed officialdom as like studying in Shaanxi. I have never taken any illegitimate money. My nephews and nieces have seen this firsthand. Now I am old and sell my writing for a living. My hernia causes me severe pain, but if I can hold a pen, I will force myself to write. Recently, everything has become expensive, rice is more precious than pearls, and firewood is more precious than cinnamon. Prices are still rising every day, and I am worried that I will not be able to afford congee. The banquet that my nephews and nieces are planning will cost several thousand taels of gold in one day. How can I afford it? My nephews and nieces know this very well. My close friends have always taken care of me, and I am grateful. But even if my nephews and nieces are planning for me, it is easy to gather thousands of fox furs, so why not allow me to save my limited energy for the remaining years of my life, instead of spending it all in one day for pleasure? Even if those who benefit me do not say it, can I not feel ashamed in my heart? I heard that Zheng is asking Sun Zhang to write a birthday speech for me, but I firmly refused. It seems that I am being unfeeling. When Tang Jingxian was governing Suzhou and his birthday arrived, the scholars and officials of Suzhou offered him birthday screens, but he firmly refused. Wang Hanlin ordered the scribe Wen Zai to record this matter. How can I dare to compare myself to Jingxian, and view Yao Feng as the author? It is still being unfeeling. It is not too late to cancel the banquet. Zhou Zhigui sold his house in his later years to help the army and moved to a humble alley. When he was eighty years old, his son joined the army. His nephew asked to perform a play to celebrate his birthday. Zhigui said that he did not take the goods and property of the poor, nor the strength of the old. He also told his nephew that scholars are nothing but paper tigers, and they cannot be lavish. I will use these words to thank my nephews and nieces and the gentlemen in my hometown. They have always understood me. Chao Laoren."

### Four American Liners To Arrive in Shanghai This Month

### Coal Companies Control Spot Goods Excessively Issue Warehouse Receipts

The supply of spot goods in the coal market has obviously increased in the past two weeks. However, there are few inquiries for these spot goods, and although the supply of warehouse receipts is large, the demand still exceeds the supply due to the wide range of channels. This is because most of those active in the coal market at present are speculators, who are solely focused on raising prices for profit. They are not interested in buying and selling spot goods, because once spot goods are purchased, they must be released quickly. Otherwise, they would have to rent additional warehouse space and pay storage fees or transportation costs, increasing the cost. However, there are no such expenses for purchasing warehouse receipts, and the cost is naturally lower. If the authorities were to investigate the inventory of coal, they could avoid suspicion of hoarding. Moreover, buying and selling warehouse receipts is easier and more convenient than spot goods. Therefore, warehouse receipts are considered a scarce commodity in the market, and speculators are competing to buy them, and there is a risk of prices being raised. As a result, gray market activity is rampant, and speculators are waiting for slight changes in the domestic and international situation to sharply raise prices. According to another source, several large coal companies are also taking advantage of the opportunity to issue more warehouse receipts, claiming to "regulate the coal market," while hiding spot goods for their own use and refusing to sell. Therefore, the only important thing today is for the authorities to order the major coal companies to restrict the issuance of warehouse receipts. The supply of legitimate coal merchants should also be adjusted to prevent hoarding, and other industries that are legitimately using coal should be supplied without restriction. This would perhaps eliminate gray market activity in the coal market.

### British Territorial Waters Surcharges on Water Insurance

The Shanghai Marine Insurance Association and the Insurance Industry Association have reportedly agreed that, as of April 10 of this year, the insurance rates for the coasts of the English, Irish, Red Sea, Black Sea, and Gulf of Aden will be subject to the following surcharges on the current water insurance rates for all voyages originating, terminating, or stopping in the following areas, with the insured amount calculated per hundred yuan: (A) All of mainland Europe and Iceland within the area from the northern White Russia to the Strait of Gibraltar: 5 jiao per hundred. (B) Black Sea, Red Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and their connecting waterways, as well as all ports in the Gulf of Aden: 3 jiao 7 fen 5 li per hundred. (C) Within the British Dominions and territories, and the territories of its Allied countries, outside of areas (A) and (B), but excluding voyages originating, terminating, or both originating and terminating in the Western Hemisphere (i.e., North America, Central America, South America, and the islands within their territorial waters): 1 jiao 2 fen 5 li per hundred. The surcharges for the above items (A), (B), and (C) must be calculated incrementally. For example, a voyage from Shanghai to the Suez Canal via Hong Kong will be subject to both (B) and (C) surcharges, i.e., 3 jiao 7 fen 5 li per hundred plus an additional 1 jiao 2 fen 5 li per hundred.

### Consistency in the Practice of the Five Teachings

At the 14th lecture of the Melting Pot Sutra Society, Mr. Sun Xiangzhong lectured on the consistency in the practice of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam. After members of the society introduced Mr. Sun's background, he began his lecture by saying: The world has countless religions. To name the major ones, there are Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam. Those who enter into these religions with a heart for integration often say that the spirit of each religion is the same, so why are their actual manifestations so different? Upon careful examination, one finds that the rise of each religion has its own time and place. Ancient sages established teachings to save the world and guide people, so they necessarily focused on the customs and practices of the people of their time. Because the customs and practices of different eras differ, the rules of each religion also differ from one another. However, the differences among religions are also their strengths, and that is where they offer remedies for the contemporary world.

Since the rules of each religion are not the same, it seems difficult to communicate based on their apparent differences. But today, when we talk about the possibility of integrating religions, we are tracing back to the fundamental nature of their source. However, when it comes to this fundamental nature, how exactly is it round or square, long or short? There are things that cannot be measured, and so ultimately we return to the unspeakable, the unspeakable. If it is said to be unspeakable, then it can no longer have names or forms. In the end, even the teachings cease to exist, and there is no need to talk about integration anymore. This is pursuing the essence of religion, detaching from reality, and naturally walking the path of transcendence.

To understand religion, both ends must be given equal importance, and especially the way the ancient sages dwelt in the central path and put it to use must be sought. The foundation of religion is rooted in the source of inherent nature: Confucianism's Great Heaven, Buddhism's Tathagata, Taoism's Naturalness, Christianity's Universal Love, and Islam's True Master. This is the upper end. The purpose of religion is to love humanity universally. Confucianism seeks to illuminate virtue throughout the world, Buddhism takes great compassion as its foundation, Taoism values taking the world as one's own self, Christianity teaches that I came to serve others, and Islam considers this world as the field for the next. This is the lower end. What is valued in dwelling in the central path and putting it to use is precisely the practice that connects the upper and lower ends, the perfect integration of nature and form, responding to events without forgetting one's nature, preserving one's nature without forgetting the events, body, mind, Dao, and art, all working together. This is the consistency of practice.

The Great Dao is everywhere, and principle and phenomena are inherently not two. It is only people's opinions that obstruct the space between them, so they often go to extremes, clinging to principle and becoming rigidly empty, adhering to events and becoming bogged down. Events and principles do not complement each other, and so they deviate from the Dao, straying further and further away, creating immense suffering in the world.

Now, if we want to save this world of great suffering, there is one prerequisite: What is this condition? It is that we must value human morality. If people seek to accord with the Dao, they must strive to fully realize their human nature and exert themselves in the world. Therefore, we utilize the already established plans of the great religions to achieve their goals. Goals have different sizes and priorities, so the implementation of plans also vary in size and priority. By studying religion, one can understand its essence, not cling to its forms, and not conflict with one another due to differences in rules. Moreover, one should adopt new plans in a timely manner, melting ancient and modern learning, Dao, and art into one furnace. What is central and what is secondary should be used together. From religion, various sciences can be nurtured, so that a complete and good civilization can be cultivated. The goals that each religion sets, such as Great Harmony, the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the Kingdom of Heaven, and so on, can then be realized everywhere.

As for the stages of implementing the plans of each religion, there are naturally near-term and long-term perspectives. Speaking of what humanity urgently needs, the high and far-reaching lies in extending the origin to attain the union of nature and heaven, a deep and traceless state, equating a thousand ages to a single breath. The broad and near-term lies in encompassing the present world to seek the union of self and others, promoting universality, and uniting all nations into one. But the key to implementation lies in first achieving the union of body and mind. When the heart has a central master, it is sufficient to open and close all phenomena, never ceasing. How can body and mind be united? One must firmly adhere to precepts, temper habits, and return to purity. How can self and others be united? One must broadly extend love, and only by truly having no self can one truly have others. How can nature and heaven be united? One must forget oneself and also forget things, and naturally attain a state of divine movement. These methods are vastly different, and the efforts required are extremely different, but every drop returns to the source, all being in accordance with the way of humanity. Only in this way can one truly connect the spirit of each religion, and only in this way can one truly realize the consistency of practice in each religion. These humble opinions are not meant to be definitive. I respectfully ask the eminent figures of the present age to offer their guidance!

The thirteenth lecture, given by my late father, on the fundamental consistency of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam, has already been announced in print.

### Mourners at the Lonely Battalion Camp Continued to Arrive Yesterday in an Endless Stream, but Strict Precautions Prevented Entry; the Date of the Memorial Service Has Not Yet Been Decided

Since the memorial service for Lonely Battalion Commander Zhang Xie was postponed, due to the abrupt nature of the decision, many in various circles were unable to learn of it. Therefore, from morning to night yesterday, many people continued to arrive to participate. The police department, in order to maintain order on the occasion of the Fifth Anniversary Memorial, took special emergency measures. Except for those who sent wreaths and elegiac couplets, no one else was allowed to enter the camp. Many Chinese and Western detectives were stationed at the camp gate, and a red police car was on alert nearby in the morning. In addition, temporary barbed wire was set up at the intersections of Singapore Road and Haifang Road, and Jiaozhou Road and Changping Road, to search pedestrians and vehicles if necessary. As a result, the atmosphere around the Lonely Battalion camp was quite tense. According to reliable sources, the Public Works Department police authorities did not have any contact with Deputy Regiment Commander Lei yesterday. They plan to send someone to the Lonely Battalion camp this morning to discuss and decide on the date of the memorial service with Deputy Regiment Commander Lei.

### American Missionary in Yichang Lives in Constant Worry, Movement and Food are Restricted, US Dollars Cannot be Remitted

The Continental News reports that news from Yichang describes the plight of an American missionary and his family living outside the city. It is said that the missionary's family is restricted by the Japanese army, allowed to leave their residence only three times a week. Moreover, their purchase of food is also restricted by the Japanese authorities, leaving them with insufficient food for the missionary couple and their two children. For example, eggs can be bought for four per dollar, but the quantity is limited and insufficient. What is worse, the missionary is now penniless, which is also due to the restrictions imposed by the Japanese army. The missionary's salary, paid in US dollars, is all stored in Shanghai. For several months, they have wanted to remit it to Yichang, but they have not obtained permission from the Japanese.

### Price Increase for Public Buses of British Merchants Must be Approved

The British-owned China General Omnibus Company has recently petitioned the Public Works Department to increase fares, citing huge expenses. According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter, the fare increase for public buses must be reviewed and approved by the Public Utilities Committee, so its implementation is still pending. Residents generally believe that the fares of public buses on various routes have been repeatedly increased since 19XX, so they hope that the company can reorganize its business, prevent fare increases, and reduce the burden on passengers.

### Japanese Side Claims That the Goods from Nanguo Ship Case Was Smoothly Resolved

The Shanghai Times reports that when answering questions about the Nanguo freighter Tommy Kirafu at a press conference yesterday afternoon (the 2nd), a Japanese naval spokesman said that the Japanese side believes that the matter has been smoothly resolved. The spokesman reiterated the Japanese desire to prevent European wars from spreading to the Far East, saying that the peaceful resolution of the matter made the Japanese authorities "pleased." The Italian authorities' purchase of Tommy Kirafu was the basis for the resolution.

### Daughter of a Prominent Family Conspired with Kidnappers to Kidnap Her Brother and Sister-in-Law, but Failed; Failed to Entice Cheng Zeheng's Chauffeur; Accomplices Also Committed Other Kidnappings

Jing'an Temple Patrol arrested Wang Wenying, a 22-year-old woman from Ningbo, and Zhang Hongxiang, Zai Jinbiao, Mark Bai, and others, and sent them to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu took the seat to continue the interrogation. The defendants were represented by lawyers Wang Yaotang, Fan Gang, Qian Zheng, Yu Enliang, Song Yuntao, and others. According to Patrol Lawyer Li Zhishan, the defendants Wang Wenying, Zhang Hongxiang, and Mark Bai are being prosecuted for conspiring to kidnap Cheng Zeheng

with intent to extort a ransom.

Cheng Zeheng graduated from the Soochow Law School and is a lawyer living at 533 West Ames Road in the French Concession. His family is wealthy. He has a private car with license plate number 320. However, he did not follow family instructions and had an affair with the rogue Zhang Jipin, opening room 425 at the Continental Hotel. Zhang and Ma also often went there to chat. Because they were financially strapped, Wang suggested that since her brother-in-law Cheng Zeheng

is quite wealthy,

it would be better to kidnap him and demand a ransom of at least hundreds of thousands or millions of yuan. They discussed it and agreed to use a car to kidnap him on a certain day, but it failed due to time constraints. Later, they bought a car and tried to kidnap him again. On one hand, Wang contacted Cheng's chauffeur, Yu Chang, and asked him to cooperate. However, Yu Chang's conscience had not been extinguished. Not only did he refuse to cooperate, but he also told Wang not to commit such an illegal act, and the matter failed again. Lawyer Li then said that the defendant Zai Jinbiao kidnapped

Sheng Sheng Ranch

Owner Shen Jiucheng at 10:11 AM on August 24 last year. Shen's family lived at 500, Lane 541, Anhe Temple Road and had a car with license plate number 3735. Every morning, he went to Sheng Sheng Ranch at 175 West Avenue. On that day, he was kidnapped outside Lane 133, Columbia Road. It was not until November that he was released. After Dai Jinbiao was arrested, he confessed that he had met Zhang Aliu at the Tongxing gambling house in Caojiadu because he liked to gamble. Zhang told Dai that they were planning to kidnap Shen Jiucheng and asked Dai to join them. Dai agreed, and they acted on August 24. At that time, Dai

carried a load of straw

on his shoulder to block Shen's car and kidnap him. Zhang told Dai that he had received a ransom of 120,000 yuan and gave Dai 10,000 yuan. Judge Liu interrogated Dai and ordered him to be detained for further review at a later date.

It is unknown how, but suddenly one of the male guests used the phone to call a friend, Mr. Jia, saying that he needed 20,000 yuan immediately. The tourist's relative, Mr. Jia, immediately called the patrol.

The New Zha, Xiehe, and Yindu gambling dens were all searched by the Japanese army. As a result, all the staff and gamblers in the three gambling dens were arrested. The reason is unknown. It is generally speculated that it may be related to the sniper attack on Japanese sentries in the area on the 28th of last month.

### Kidnapping Suspects Arrested in Hotel

Jing'an Temple Patrol Detectives Yang Fusheng, Xian Chengming, Liang Junshan, and others arrested Zhang Zhongdong, Ma Hongjun, Gu Jun, and three others from Nantong in room 209 of the Weizhi Hotel at 536 Jiujiang Road at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. Because they were suspected of being involved in a kidnapping for ransom case, they were brought to the patrol station together. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Patrol Lawyer Li Zhishan described the case, saying that Zhang Zhongdong's father was kidnapped in the Jinsha area of Nantong, and Zhang contacted the ransom procedures in Shanghai. Gu Jun had obtained 5,000 yuan from Zhang Zhongdong. Now, because the case still needs to be investigated, he requested permission to detain them. Zhang and others hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to appear in court, denying everything. The court approved the detention and adjourned the hearing for seven days for further review.

### Robbery on the Road Leads to Sentencing

### Rumors of Resumption of Navigation Between Shanghai and Ningbo Still Face Many Difficulties

The North-China Daily News reports that the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route, which has been suspended for a long time since the Japanese occupied Ningbo, is reportedly being discussed by various Japanese shipping companies to resume. According to reports, a Japanese ship has already made a trial voyage from Ningbo to Shanghai four days ago, which will be a prelude to the resumption of regular shipping in the future. However, according to relevant sources, the resumption of navigation may encounter many difficulties. All the wealthy families in Ningbo have now moved to other places, and only a few poor people remain in the city. These people have no need to travel between Shanghai and Ningbo. Moreover, since Ningbo was occupied, it is feared that no one will want to return to their hometown. According to reports, cargo transportation along the Zhejiang coast has been suspended because the Chinese authorities have ordered the blockade of all waterways and harbors, prohibiting passage. At present, the Chinese army in Zhejiang and Fujian is actively counterattacking, and fierce battles have broken out in various places near Ningbo, Zhuji, and Yongjia.

Children's Weekly

### Correcting the Attitude Towards Learning

— Yong

Many children often ask themselves: "How can I make my knowledge continuously improve?" Today, I will express some personal opinions based on this question. The first thing I want to say is that most of your attitudes towards learning are not yet on the right track. Now, let's start by discussing a few points.

Children! Are you studying medicine to seek your own knowledge, or are you studying for your parents or teachers? You certainly won't answer me that you are studying for your parents or teachers. Then why don't you pick up a book to read unless you are urged by your parents or supervised by your teachers? Of course, there are such children, but they are probably in the minority.

The second point that should be corrected is that you must never be shy when seeking knowledge. I have seen several elementary school students who are shy when asking their teachers questions from the books in the classroom, as if they can't get a word out. I really don't understand why they are so shy. The result of being shy will definitely affect their academic performance!

Now is spring, don't children like to fly kites? The higher the kite flies, the happier you are. Dear children! Seeking knowledge is just like flying a kite! After learning arithmetic, there is algebra, after learning algebra, there is trigonometry... Learn one more point and know one more point. You must never be satisfied with learning only a few points. There is often a phenomenon in schools where students in higher grades often think that their knowledge is already rich, so they despise students in lower grades! These students will one day find that they are wrong!

If you correct your attitude towards learning and are willing to work hard, your knowledge will definitely improve continuously! I hope all the children will work hard!

### Taking Notes

— Yinhua

The class leader ran in from outside and said to the classmates: "Today, Chinese teacher Mr. Li cannot come to class because he has something to do at home. Everyone should study quietly on your own"! At this time, most of the students really lowered their heads and began to read or write, but some naughty students started to make noise or scream. The class leader felt embarrassed, but luckily he quickly came up with an idea. After a while, he suggested to everyone: "Oh, classmates! I remembered, isn't Pan Xiaojuan the most hardworking and best-performing student in our entire grade? Don't all the teachers praise her? Then can't we take this opportunity to ask her to talk about her study methods? What do you all think"? Before he finished speaking, a chorus of approval immediately erupted, and all the classmates focused their eyes on Xiaojuan, watching how she would react.

Of course, she was shy and blushed, unwilling to get up. Some classmates nearby waved at her, some winked and stuck out their tongues, all urging her to go up quickly. As a result, she was finally dragged up by Ying, who sat next to her, and had to walk to the stage.

Once she was on stage, she was no longer coy. She put on a serious face and began to speak, her voice was quite loud.

"I am very grateful for everyone's praise for my academic progress and for asking me to talk about my study methods. Actually, I am not very hardworking. The method I use is nothing more than "taking notes" that Mr. Li has talked about in the past. Indeed, the effectiveness of taking notes is great, especially in helping our memory!..."

"Well, we cannot deny that we always remember a big discount on the scattered but important words, sentences... etc. that the teacher says in class. At this time, we need to use "notes". On the one hand, it can concentrate our attention, and on the other hand, it can enhance our memory and impression. In other words, the effect is several times greater!

"As for the method of taking notes, it is even easier and more extensive, because taking notes is a work that can be done anytime and anywhere. When the teacher is speaking, those difficult, fresh words, sentences, wordings, or classical narratives, the places where we are prone to make mistakes when writing essays, ... and many other things that are not easy to remember are all good materials for notes.

"After you get home, you can organize them, or look up the dictionary again, and add some annotations and pronunciations. Finally, make a careful deliberation and reflection... In this way, what you get is of course very rich and perfect. Therefore, when you are writing an essay, you can apply it very freely, and progress will naturally be fast!...

"Finally, there is one more thing to say: The formation of this habit of taking notes requires great perseverance and patience"!

The classmates who were messing around just now all nodded knowingly.

### Fantasy

— Wenya

Once upon a time, there was a country girl whose family was very poor. Therefore, she went to work for a milk company—milking cows for them. She worked very diligently, so the company owner often praised her.

One day, the company's mistress gave her a bucket of milk and said to her: "You can sell this bucket of milk, get the money, and buy something you need." The girl was very happy when she heard this, so she quickly thanked the mistress, put the milk bucket on her head, and walked towards the town triumphantly.

On the road, she smiled all the way, thinking to herself: "What a lucky girl I am! I am going to sell this bucket of milk and buy some eggs. After I get back, I will borrow a hen from the mistress and put the eggs under her to incubate; I think the mistress will definitely allow me to. Soon, the hen will hatch a group of exquisite and lovely chicks. I will raise them, and after a year, they will all have grown very fat and big. At that time, I will sell them and definitely get more money! Then, I will go buy a beautiful dress, and it must be made of green silk. Yes! With this new green silk dress, plus a new hat and new shoes, I will become a pretty lady! At that time, I will be more noble and gorgeous than the girls on the farm. When I walk past them, I will no longer look at them. If they talk to me, I will no longer answer a word. I will stick out my chest and shake my head—like this. Ha..." As soon as the girl thought of shaking her head, she really shook her head a few times. Unexpectedly, the milk bucket on her head immediately fell down after she shook her head like this. All the milk in the bucket was spilled on the ground. So, she stood by the side of the road and cried loudly. The fantasy in her heart also disappeared with it.

### Can Plants Feel?

— Yesuo

Dear children! If I were to ask you, "Can plants feel?" I think you would definitely answer me, "No, they cannot. Plants have neither brains nor central nervous systems, so how can they feel like animals?"

However, children! Your answer is indeed wrong. You should know that some plants possess special cells that can sense external stimuli and vibrations.

In Brazil, there is a plant called Mimosa pudica. If you blow on it or touch it with your finger, it immediately closes its leaves and droops down, as if a person is lowering their head in shyness. Therefore, people call it Mimosa pudica.

Besides Mimosa pudica, there is also a plant called Hydrangea macrophylla. Its stamens are exceptionally sensitive. As long as you touch it lightly, its stamens will immediately contract.

Children! Do you find these two plants strange? Do you want to see them once? While Hydrangea macrophylla may not be easy to find, Mimosa pudica can be seen in Shanghai.

### Two Methods of Making Plaster Models

— Kun

Xiao Lin saw that his classmates at school mostly had plaster models. They used wax to cast little cats, Snow White, the Seven Dwarfs, ... and he couldn't help but feel envious. So he asked his father to buy him one. His older brother, Da Lin, heard this and chimed in, "I'll make one for you!" It turned out that he had learned how to make models. Xiao Lin's original desire was just for one model. Now, seeing that his brother had agreed to make one for him, he was very happy. So Da Lin went to buy the materials—plaster powder and a celluloid toy. When he came back, he put the plaster powder in a pot and stir-fried it for a while, then poured it out. Then he found a suitably sized cardboard box.

With everything ready, Da Lin began to work. He first coated the celluloid toy with a thin layer of Vaseline, then mixed the plaster powder with water to make a slurry (neither too thin nor too thick), poured it into the box, and placed half of the oiled toy into it. In an instant, half of the plaster model was made. He took it out, trimmed it a bit, and used a knife to carve out a square piece of plaster on the side.

Xiao Lin watched in a daze, but he didn't understand why the plaster powder had to be stir-fried? Why did the toy have to be oiled? And why did a square piece have to be carved out of one side of the model? Finally, he couldn't wait to ask his brother.

Da Lin agreed and, while pouring some more plaster powder into the box, explained to him, "Because the plaster powder I bought is raw plaster powder, it still contains some moisture. Stir-frying it evaporates the moisture, making it mature plaster powder. After this step, the model will dry faster. Coating the toy with oil prevents the plaster from sticking to it, so you can't take it out. As for why a square piece is carved out of half of the model and trimmed? Because this makes the model fit together better; the cast wax figure will also be more lifelike." At this time, the plaster model was complete. The toy was also taken out. There was a lot of plaster powder left, so Da Lin broke open the toy with a knife, also coated the inside with Vaseline, poured in some more plaster powder, waited for it to be half-dry, put the two halves together, pinched them tightly, and after it dried, removed the toy. A snow-white plaster model appeared before his eyes. Da Lin handed them to his younger brother. Xiao Lin held the two models and ran off joyfully.

### The Poor Man Buying Cheap Rice

— Shizi

At noon, Ming'er carried his schoolbag home, running with skips and jumps. When he reached the corner of the road, there were many poorly dressed people, lined up as if they were doing gymnastics class at school, but in their hands, they all held a tattered bag or basket. There were old women and little girls, tall ones and short ones, but unlike the gymnastics class at school, they weren't lined up neatly according to height. Ming'er felt very strange. He carefully followed the strange line of people and saw a piece of white paper pasted on the wall around the corner, with the words "Cheap Rice for Sale" written on it. Ming'er thought this was a rice-selling shop, but why did people have to line up to buy rice? Ming'er didn't understand! He decided to go ask his brother, so he quickly ran home.

Zhao'er had also just come home from school. He saw Ming'er running in urgently, grabbed his arm and said, "Brother, when I came back from school, I saw many poor people on the road, lining up to buy rice in a restaurant. Do you have to line up to buy rice?"

Zhao'er also often passed that place on his way home from school, so he understood as soon as he heard. He told Ming'er to let go of his hand and said kindly, "This is a place to buy 'cheap rice', not a restaurant..."

"Cheap rice', that's right! I saw a sign on the wall that said, 'Cheap rice for sale'." Ming'er said happily.

"But you don't know what 'cheap rice' means, so you mistook it for a 'restaurant'. 'Cheap rice' is rice that is very cheap. A group of philanthropists, seeing how high the price of rice is, and that the poor can't survive, had a good idea. They cooked white rice and told the poor to come and buy it, and the price is much cheaper than elsewhere. So ordinary rice in a restaurant costs two dimes a bowl, but at this 'cheap rice place', you can buy a pound of rice for a dime. Because the people running this 'cheap rice place' intend to help the poor, they not only don't make money on the rice, but they're probably losing money."

As Zhao'er said this, their mother called them to eat lunch. The two brothers walked hand in hand to the living room to eat. Zhao'er held a bowl full of white rice and said to Ming'er, "Little brother, we eat ready-made white rice every day and don't know that many poor people are eating 'cheap rice'; even more poor people have no rice to eat and are starving to death on the streets."

Ming'er nodded, indicating that he agreed with his brother's words. His mother looked at them strangely and asked what they were talking about. Zhao'er told his mother what Ming'er had seen. His mother couldn't help but say solemnly, "Good children, it's good that you can care about the lives of the poor; but this 'cheap rice' still has to be bought with money, and many poor people don't have money; they can only starve to death. So to thoroughly help the poor, you have to make sure that every poor person has enough money to buy 'cheap rice'; this money needs to be given to the poor by every person with a conscience."

Zhao'er and Ming'er quietly listened to their mother's words. Ming'er silently put his hand into his pocket, took out a one-dollar bill, handed it to his mother, and said sincerely, "Mom, I don't want to use your money to buy candy anymore. Please give this dollar to that Jiangbei child in the alley. I saw him swallowing chaff once."

Zhao'er also took out the one dollar his mother had given him, handed it to his mother, and said to Ming'er, "Little brother, we should not only do this today, but we should do it every day."

Their mother gently continued, "That's right, you must think of the poor every day and not be selfish people!"

Memories of the Pear Garden

### Guan Opera

— Jun

During the late Qing Dynasty, the performance of Guan Opera was prohibited. Therefore, although many talented leading male actors emerged, only a few, such as Mi Xizi and Cheng Changgeng, were known for their Guan Opera roles. At that time, Beijing opera tunes were simple, focusing solely on singing skills. Mi and Cheng's performances were initially of a supporting nature, not exclusively specializing in this red-face role. According to old traditions, the earliest performer of Guan Opera was Yu Sisheng. Yu, a native of Shitai, Anhui, initially joined the Chuntai Troupe. However, due to his poor voice, he had no reputation and often ruined performances with off-key singing. He eventually retired and pondered ways to gain recognition. Before long, he suddenly rejoined Chuntai, visited the troupe leader, and requested to perform again. When asked about the play, he chose "Battle of Changsha." The troupe leader, pitying his situation, agreed. On the day of the performance, a large audience gathered. Yu Sisheng didn't apply makeup backstage but drank dozens of cups of wine without getting drunk. When the curtain rose, Yu Sisheng strode out with his sword, his energy surging, his face as red as a rainbow, dignified and solemn, his presence captivating the audience. They praised him greatly. From then on, his singing, acting, reciting, and fighting were all impeccable. He was no longer the listless and disheartened performer of the past. Since then, Yu Sisheng became famous overnight. Cheng Changgeng, who was in the Sanqing Troupe, heard of Yu Sisheng's name and was greatly surprised. He disguised himself and went to watch. Returning, he scoffed, "Is that really skill? It's just a naturally red face." The next day, Changgeng also posted "Battle of Changsha," carefully mixing ink and vermilion, meticulously applying makeup, creating unparalleled beauty. When he performed, his singing and acting were even more outstanding. The audience, who had previously praised Yu Sisheng, all agreed that Changgeng's "Old Master Play" was the best. From then on, Guan Opera occupied a place in Beijing Opera. Tracing back to its origins, the creator of Guan Opera was actually Yu Sisheng.

Although Changgeng became famous for performing Guan Opera, he was restricted by the prohibition and dared not perform it often. In his later years, he collaborated with Chi Yuquan to perform "Battle of Changsha" at Tianhe Hall. Afterward, he was summoned by the censor-in-chief. At that time, Changgeng was a leading figure in the performing arts world, with a very high reputation. He had no choice but to be supported by his disciple Xu Ani to go. Ani took five lashes on his behalf before the matter was dropped. This shows how strict the ban on performing Guan Opera was at that time. Few people know about this today, perhaps it is also a precious anecdote about Guan Opera.

Since Guan Opera was strictly prohibited during the Qing Dynasty, performers often did not seek deep understanding. In modern times, performers either lacked refinement or were too crude. It was impossible to find a complete talent. In his later years, Yang Jiang once rehearsed "Sealed Gold and Challenging the Robe" with Hao Shoushen. Hao was famous for playing Cao Cao, while Yang's Guan Yu was still a new attempt. When he appeared on stage, Yang was full of energy, neither bland nor excessive. He fully revealed Guan Yu's strong character. His makeup and recitations were also naturally exquisite, with very little artificiality or idolization. Compared to Hao's Cao Cao, it seemed to have traces of deliberate portrayal. Yang's associates regarded Yang's Guan Opera as a masterpiece, suggesting that it could not be performed again, so it was never performed again. Otherwise, the Yang school of Guan Opera could have overshadowed the Wang school, the Jing school, and the Peng school, the various schools that sing Guan Opera today.

### Shirley Temple: Recent Life Photos

— Xinying

Last year on this day, Hollywood was rumored to believe that Shirley Temple intended to leave the screen. But now, it has been proven inaccurate. Because after "The Blue Bird," she continued to make films, and recently MGM or RKO have reportedly borrowed Shirley Temple from 20th Century-Fox. This further proves that, at least for the time being, this child star will not leave the screen. Here, I will write about the reasons why Shirley Temple continues to make films to report to readers.

Nine Years in Film

She was on the screen at the age of three, and as of April 23 this year, she is exactly twelve years old. In these nine years, she has starred in many films, and each one has had considerable box office success. So not only has she earned a huge salary, but she has also earned a lot of money for 20th Century-Fox. At one time, the film company regarded her as a cash cow. The films she starred in had low costs and high profits and were sure to make money.

Preparing to Retire

The period for child stars is originally very short. A twelve-year-old child will soon lose the qualifications of a child star. Especially Shirley Temple is a precocious girl, looking like a fourteen or fifteen-year-old girl, so her mother decided last year to have Shirley Temple stop filming and leave the screen. This would allow her to go back to school for a few more years to seek a future path.

Canceling the Plan

But after this news came out, 20th Century-Fox was the first to express its retention, requesting Shirley Temple to make a few more films. At the same time, fans from all over the world also wrote letters to her mother and the film company, hoping that Shirley Temple would continue to make films. Under these circumstances, it was difficult to refuse, and Mrs. Temple had to cancel the plan.

Competing to Borrow

Therefore, Shirley Temple is still making films to this day, and recently the films she has starred in are still popular. As for the decline in box office records, it was originally affected by the war. Recently, MGM and RKO are planning to shoot the film "Panama Hattie." After it is determined which company will shoot it, it is said that they will borrow Shirley Temple to play the child role in this film.

### A True Movie Fan

— Rubing

He Yongjin, a Chinese overseas resident in the United States, has been a movie fan since he was a child. He spends all day in the cinema watching movies, becoming addicted and fascinated, and he is still like this now. He originally ran a laundry in New York, but in order to get close to the big stars and see their style, he sold his shop and went to Hollywood to work as a temporary actor to fulfill his ambitions and wishes. He appeared in the film "Heart of a Harlot" starring George Raft, Ida Lupino, Ann Sheridan, and Humphrey Bogart. George Raft liked him very much and was willing to pay him a generous salary to be his trusted attendant, but He Yongjin said, "I hope to see many stars, and don't want to follow just one person."

Chapter 8: Fallen Flowers Intentionally Follow the Flowing Water

He didn't expect that Li Xin could escape back to Qixian, and there was still a tragic massacre! He traveled day and night, traversing mountains and rivers, rushing to Daizhou. He learned that General Zhou Yuji was stationed here to prevent the Eastern invasion of the rebels, and of course Wang Yongtai was also here. On that day, he first checked into the inn, put down his luggage, and went to Zhou Yuji's headquarters to inquire about Wang Yongtai's news. He learned that Wang Shui Tai did not live in the yamen, but had a private residence on Wanhua Street in the city. Xu Jing inquired clearly and went to Wanhua Street to visit Wang Yongtai. He happened to meet Wang Yongtai entertaining guests in his residence. Receiving Xu Jing's calling card, knowing that the son of an old friend had come from afar, he immediately ordered the servants to invite him in, and went down the steps to greet him himself. Xu Jing saw that Wang Yongtai's appearance was much older than before, his temples were already gray, but his spirit was still strong. He was wearing a Tianjin blue satin jacket and black boots, with a friendly smile. He quickly bowed to him. Wang Yongtai hurriedly returned the greeting, helped him up himself, called him a virtuous nephew, and invited Xu Jing to take a seat, and introduced him to everyone, praising him. Everyone saw that Xu Jing was handsome and outstanding, a scholar but full of heroism, worthy of a young hero, and with Wang Yongtai praising him in front, everyone looked at him with new eyes. After three rounds of wine, Wang Yongtai asked him about his family situation. Xu Jing replied that his old mother had passed away, his father in Qixian had been ravaged by bandits, and he was living in obscurity, wanting to make a career in these times, so he abandoned his pen and came to join him. Wang Yongtai nodded and said, "Virtuous nephew has come at the right time. Now the world is in turmoil, it is the time for a great man to serve the country. Wait for me to introduce you to General Zhou tomorrow, and you can serve here together. Recently, I heard that the rebels Li Zicheng and others in Guanzhong are attacking and forcing Tongguan. If Tongguan is lost, they will definitely raise their troops north to spy on the capital. Maybe this place will be the first to bear the brunt, and a battle will be inevitable. The old man is about to die, only suffering that he cannot get his death. If the rebels come to covet Daizhou, I will follow Ma Fubo and wrap my body in horse hide, vowing not to return alive." All the guests said, "With General Zhou and the old hero Wang guarding here, if the rebels come, they will surely be killed without leaving a single piece of armor." Xu Jing also said, "What my uncle said is truly old and strong, I am willing to follow the whip and work together to give the rebels a heavy blow." Everyone raised their glasses, drank happily, and dispersed. (54)

Self-improvement is an active saying, while non-cessation is a passive saying. Non-cessation is the first realm, while self-improvement is the second realm. Without being able to not cease, one cannot self-improve.
