### Resolute Stance Against Aggression: Britain and America's Unwavering Resolve to Aid China; Japan Contacts the U.S. to Reopen Negotiations: A Litmus Test for Future Intentions

Reuters, London, 19th – The Sunday Times diplomatic correspondent stated that the UK and its Dominions, as well as the United States, intend to make clear to Japan their opposition to any continued development of its policy of encroachment. The determination of the democratic nations has been strengthened by Tojo's insistence that Japan maintain its ties with the Axis powers. The British Ambassador to Japan will soon meet with the new Japanese Prime Minister to clarify Britain's official stance and, at the same time, inquire into the relationship between the change of cabinet and Japan's future foreign policy. Tojo's statement that he will continue to promote the resolution of the China Incident does not affect the determination of Britain and America to continue aiding the Chongqing government. As for Japan's future intentions, they can be assessed by how it approaches the continuation of the U.S.-Japan talks in Washington.

Reuters, London, 19th – Insiders are paying close attention to the news that Japan is currently seeking to reopen talks with the United States, considering Japan's approach to these talks as a litmus test for its future intentions. According to observers here, one of the reasons for the collapse of the Konoe Cabinet was dissatisfaction from some quarters regarding the speed and direction of the U.S.-Japan talks. While some here suspect that Japan may take the opportunity to launch a surprise attack on the Soviet Union, others welcome the new Japanese cabinet's proposal to Washington as an encouraging sign and an indication of a genuine desire to maintain peace in the Pacific.

Reuters, Washington, 19th – The State Department disclosed that Secretary of State Hull and Assistant Secretary Welles met with Japanese Deputy Ambassador Wakasugi for a considerable time on Friday. A State Department spokesman stated that the two sides exchanged general views on U.S.-Japan relations. Some officials believe that Wakasugi informed the State Department that, despite the cabinet change in Tokyo, negotiations aimed at resolving the U.S.-Japan dispute will continue.

### Chongqing Newspaper Analysis: Japan's Political Situation - Three Factions Stand Opposed Domestically; New Cabinet's Lifespan Unlikely to be Long

Reuters, Chongqing, 19th – The Central Daily News today published an article, cautiously analyzing the nature of Japan's new cabinet, concluding that the Tojo Cabinet is merely an extension of the Konoe Cabinet, not a war cabinet, and is therefore destined to fail. The article states: "Upon careful study of the figures in the Tojo Cabinet, the following observations can be made: (1) Many members of the new cabinet are reappointments from the previous cabinet, indicating that Tojo was unable to find suitable individuals to fill the vacancies, at least four of them. This may be because many people were unwilling to join the new cabinet. (2) When Tojo was ordered to form a cabinet, the Emperor summoned the Minister of the Navy and ordered the Navy to cooperate with the Army. This indicates that the Japanese Navy and Army are still in opposition, their intentions not aligned as before. (3) Five of the ten new cabinet members were members of the Konoe cabinet, representing the forces of Konoe, Hiranuma, and Kido. (4) The appointment of Kaya as Minister of Finance by capitalists and industrialists indicates that Tojo is still under their influence. Furthermore, the new Foreign Minister Togo is an experienced diplomat, and he has never been known to engage in adventurous diplomacy, and he initiated the negotiations for the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. (5) The Tojo Cabinet is definitely not a war cabinet, as only four out of ten members are military personnel, while the Konoe Cabinet had seven military personnel. Of the four military personnel in the new cabinet, two are from the Navy and two are from the Army. Therefore, we dare to say that the Tojo Cabinet is composed of military figures, civilian officials, and financiers, and has no special character. The Tojo Cabinet will not adopt a foreign policy that is radically different from that of the Konoe Cabinet. This is not a strong cabinet, and its lifespan will not be long." The newspaper's diplomatic correspondent said that there are currently three factions in Japan: (1) Those who advocate resolving disputes with Britain and the United States through negotiations; (2) Those who advocate taking more active action, either northward or southward; (3) Those who stand in the middle of the two extremes, which Tojo represents. The Konoe Cabinet was forced to resign due to dissatisfaction with the 49 days of negotiations with the United States without results. However, the Emperor and the elder statesmen hesitated to hand over power to the extremist faction, and decided to order Tojo to form a compromise cabinet to continue efforts to seek concessions from Britain and the United States. However, the obstacles encountered by the Konoe Cabinet still exist. The Tojo Cabinet's compromise policy will fail after a short life, and then the extremist elements will be in control of the government.

### Japanese Ambassador to Spain Arrives in Portugal to Discuss Aviation Issues

Reuters, Lisbon, 19th – The Japanese Ambassador to Spain, who flew here from the capital of Spain on Friday, will discuss matters relating to the establishment of a postal air route between Japan and Portuguese Timor Island (in the Malay Archipelago). According to news earlier this week, the Portuguese Prime Minister and the Japanese Minister to Portugal have signed an agreement to establish this route.

### Japan's New Cabinet is Weak Externally but Strong Internally; Adopts a Two-Faced Diplomatic Policy: Simultaneously Seeking Rapprochement with the U.S. and Aiding the Axis; Unlikely to Take Rash Action Against the Soviet Union

United Press, Washington, 19th – It is generally believed here yesterday that General Tojo's new Japanese cabinet will take strong steps to safeguard Japan's position, but it is not believed that Japan will immediately take further expansionist actions. It is speculated that Foreign Minister Togo's first step will be to attempt to negotiate a resolution with the Soviet Union while continuing its talks with Washington on Far Eastern issues. Although an attack on the Soviet Union is not considered absolutely impossible, it is believed that Japan will first seek a diplomatic solution.

Reuters, Washington, 19th – Yesterday, all the newspapers here prominently featured Prime Minister Tojo's remarks and the talks between Japanese Deputy Ambassador Wakasugi and State Department official Welles, with headlines such as "Tokyo Asks the United States to Resume Peace Talks" and "Japan Plans to Aid the Axis While Seeking to Appease the United States." The Star criticized Tojo's remarks, saying that Japan has clearly stated that its government is two-faced, seeking to tie the hands of the United States while at the same time aiding Hitler to the extreme. Tojo even admitted in his official remarks that he would make Japan's ties with the Axis powers even closer, while Wakasugi relayed to Welles Japan's willingness to reopen peace talks. The Australian government's Prime Minister Curtin's statement that the Australian government is closely watching all developments is also highly valued by the evening newspapers. However, the Australian government's order that newspaper reports regarding the Far Eastern crisis be limited to official statements is considered significant by the evening newspapers.

United Press, Washington, 19th – "The Washington Star" stated in yesterday's editorial, "Unless a political miracle occurs, Japan has decided to achieve its hegemony in East Asia with the samurai sword, or else commit national seppuku as punishment for defeat." The newspaper stated that the new Prime Minister Tojo Hideki is a well-known warmonger, "When the time is ripe, Japan will take action. Is there any doubt? As the Soviet Union suffers a disastrous defeat in Europe, Japan's attack on Siberia is imminent."

### Japanese Newspapers Comment Extensively, Expressing Great Expectations for the New Cabinet

United Press, Tokyo, 19th – Japan's new Prime Minister Tojo visited the Ise Grand Shrine in central Japan at 10 p.m. last night to report his "assumption of new office." This move reflects the severity of the international situation. He will return to Tokyo today. According to normal procedures, the Prime Minister usually makes his first trip to the shrine within two weeks of forming a new government. Other cabinet officials will go within this week. Japanese newspapers celebrated the rapid formation of the new cabinet, because Japan is encountering an unprecedented crisis.

Reuters, Tokyo, 19th – "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that Japan's new cabinet is what the Japanese people have long hoped for, a cabinet that can cope with the serious situation facing Japan. It eagerly hopes that the new cabinet can fulfill its mission, and at the same time, it will strive to eliminate various internal and external obstacles that may hinder the realization of Japan's national policy. "Nichinichi Shimbun" commented on the fact that the new cabinet only replaced six members compared to the previous cabinet, saying that Tojo, who was a key figure in the Konoe cabinet in his capacity as Minister of the Army, is now the head of the new government, which shows that there will be no major changes in policy. The new Minister of Commerce and Industry stated that the new government's aim is to promote the edge of the East Asian prosperity sphere, and to adopt a policy of low prices. It is generally believed that the new cabinet's retention of four former cabinet civilians is only for the convenience of affairs, and not because of policy reasons. Prime Minister Tojo's concurrent appointment as Minister of the Army and Minister of the Interior is noteworthy, and Tojo's appointment of Togo as Foreign Minister can be seen as a clue to Japan's future foreign policy, as Ambassador to the United Kingdom Shigemitsu Aoi is currently in Tokyo, and has the qualifications for a long diplomatic career, but is not used. Therefore, some people believe that Japan will try to maintain tranquility in the north and leave the south to wait for future development. Furthermore, Lieutenant General Suzuki, a cabinet member who does not hold a ministry, is currently retaining his original position, which is also a noteworthy point.

### Willkie's Radio Address: Incompatible with Axis Powers; Advocates Abolishing Hypocritical Neutrality Law; Yarnall Also Criticizes Japanese Policy

Reuters, New York, 19th – Willkie recently delivered a speech during a national broadcast initiated by the "Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies," stating that the United States must abandon the hope of peace. The Axis powers are now gradually gaining the upper hand. If we do not act quickly, it will be too late. We must no longer deceive ourselves. We must know that Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo are linked by the dangerous dream of conquering the world, unbreakable, believing that the victory of one country is the victory of all. Their aim is to control the world and destroy freedom and democracy. Our ships, if not armed, will continue to be torpedoed and sunk. Unless we deliver rapidly increasing quantities of goods to the countries fighting for freedom by sea and land, the victory of the Axis powers cannot be stopped. But even that is not enough. We must abolish the hypocritical Neutrality Law. We have no room for negotiation with the warmongers of Tokyo and the dictators of Berlin, but only to stop them on every continent and in every ocean. Mr. Willkie did not broadcast in person due to a cold. The speech was read by Ms. Thompson on his behalf.

International News Service, Providence, Rhode Island, 19th – Former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Rear Admiral Yarnall, said in a radio address today that the policy of Japanese expansionists is merely an "excuse." He also said that the soldiers in Tokyo are now trying to profit from the war in China. Mr. Yarnall continued, "We anticipate that the futile efforts to mediate between the U.S. and Japan will now come to an end." Mr. Yarnall has always advocated a tough policy towards Japan.

United Press, New York, 19th – "The New York Times" stated in yesterday's editorial that no matter what difficulties the United States encounters, it must not abandon its opposition to Japanese aggression. The newspaper said that the only hope for limiting the area of unrest from spreading and the conquest actions in the Pacific is to continue the current policy of the U.S. government. The editorial warned against allowing Japan's policy of intimidating the United States to continue to develop. The newspaper pointed out that the U.S. Pacific Fleet has the power to tighten economic pressure, and can also send more bombers from the U.S. Army to China, in order to effectively resist any aggressive action by the Japanese cabinet. "The New York Herald Tribune" said, "The era of short-sighted appeasement is now over, and a new era of honesty is about to begin, but this may worsen U.S.-Japan relations." "The Baltimore Sun" explained the Japanese cabinet crisis, saying that it was another victory for the extremist elements in Japan. This move is a good lesson in isolation, and they opposed the U.S. policy of aiding the Soviet Union, but have failed.

### U.S. Aircraft Arrive in New Zealand: Maiden Flight Postponed

At the same time, the "Clipper" on the route to Honolulu has also been postponed.

### Australia Cooperates with Democratic Nations to Jointly Cope with the Far Eastern Crisis; Australian Prime Minister States that Preliminary Defense Plans Have Been Completed; Dutch East Indies Hints at Willingness to Provide Bases for U.S. Use

Reuters, Canberra, 19th – Australian Prime Minister Curtin warned last night that aggressors are now making desperate attempts to defeat the Soviet Union and expand the war in the Pacific. If the Soviet Union is defeated, Germany will be free to turn to Southwest Asia and North Africa in the winter, and return to attack Britain in the spring. If the war extends to the Pacific, the Australian people will take a completely realistic view of the protection of their vital interests. Australia wants to maintain peace in the Pacific, and does not want to participate in a policy of encirclement, nor does it want to take aggressive actions that could disrupt peace, but Australia is fully determined to do everything in its power to defend itself. All preliminary measures necessary for the defense of Australia and its territory have been taken. Important decisions have been made regarding cooperation with Pacific nations, which is the responsibility of the government. In summary, the Australian people and government are paying very close attention to all developments.

United Press, Canberra, 19th – Australian Prime Minister Curtin suddenly convened a special wartime cabinet meeting yesterday. Afterwards, an official gazette was issued stating, "I assure the people that the government is paying attention to all the facts and has taken all necessary preliminary defense steps to protect the territory of this country." Mr. Curtin said that he had recently discussed Pacific defense measures with the United States. He said, "Since I took office, the government has taken a number of important decisions to cooperate with other Pacific nations. These decisions have gone further than what was previously considered possible. Our naval strength is very abundant, the army is well-trained, and the armaments have greatly improved. Our air force strength has greatly increased, and the production of armaments, including aircraft, is progressing every week. In addition to our self-defense capabilities, it is particularly exciting that our country can closely cooperate with other democratic countries in the Pacific. If the war spreads to the Pacific, Australians will take an absolutely practical view of protecting their main interests, and will resolutely do everything in their power to defend themselves." He also said, "The government has jointly conducted a broad review of the situation with Sir Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Forces."

London, 19th – A spokesman for the Dutch Foreign Ministry hinted yesterday that "if the United States requests to find a base in the Dutch East Indies, the Netherlands may grant its request."

We stand with the democratic countries in the Pacific." When asked if the U.S. fleet could obtain a base in the Dutch East Indies, the spokesman said that this matter could be decided by a meeting of military leaders.

International News Service, Sydney, 19th – "The Sydney Daily Telegraph" yesterday called for the United States to immediately "wake up Japan's delusion" regarding its intentions in the Pacific.

They are now being instigated by the Germans, so these people should be awakened from their delusion immediately. The United States should take the lead in this matter." "The Sydney Morning Herald" also said, "The war is now on the verge of crisis. Tojo's appointment as the new Japanese Prime Minister can predict this island nation's pro-Axis policy. The United States should take on this most difficult responsibility in this time of crisis."

Editorial

### A Perspective on Japan Today

When the news of Konoe's resignation and Tojo's cabinet formation first spread, the international community experienced no less trepidation and shock than when the Tripartite Pact was concluded last autumn. Even now, the personality of the Tojo cabinet remains, in the eyes of the Japanese themselves, as something whose "precise political qualities are not yet fully clear." However, in its first declarations upon formation, such as the selection of cabinet members and the announcement of domestic and foreign policy platforms, it has not given the impression of reckless recklessness. Instead, it appears to align with the views of some who speculated that "once the military takes the stage, it will shift toward conservatism." Based on this observation, even though various aspects related to the Pacific have been extremely tense in recent days, it may not necessarily be difficult for them to relax momentarily. What follows the cabinet reshuffle in Japan may not necessarily be the initiation of southward or northward expansion, but rather the continuation of US-Japan negotiations or the launching of a diplomatic offensive against the Soviet Union. In the past two days, optimistic views have begun to sprout in the democratic countries. Some may believe that the tense Pacific situation is not difficult to restore to what it was more than a month ago!

The mandate to form a cabinet in Japan being bestowed upon a young, active-duty military officer can naturally be explained by numerous reasons. However, the most important point is that, apart from this, Japanese politics today has no other path to take. In other words, after all other attempts have failed, it is necessary to play its last card. Tojo is the center of gravity of the young military officers, but in addition to being capable, he is also a military officer with a multifaceted personality. He drafted plans for operations against both China and the Soviet Union and launched anti-British and anti-Soviet movements. However, he also patiently supported the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact and negotiations with the United States in the second and third Konoe cabinets. He is known as a radical but has little connection with the "reformist" faction and has always remained a military officer, unlike other military officers with strong political inclinations such as Koiso, Yanagawa, Kawakami, and Kobayashi. In recent Japan, there is no doubt that the conservative camp has failed. However, no matter how much the radical elements clamor, or how Nazi Germany uses diplomacy, they would rather let the military officer Tojo take power than allow the likes of Nakano Seigo to rise to prominence. This shows that they have not given up the final step of control over the political situation. What Tojo has been displaying in recent days may be precisely what the senior statesmen expect of him. After the "February 26th Incident," Lin Senjuro formed a cabinet as a military officer and unexpectedly obtained the cooperation of the zaibatsu. His measures were not more extreme than those of his predecessors. This is not without precedent in Japan.

However, the essence of things can never be judged solely by their appearance. Especially in today's Japanese political situation, one should not attempt to discern the whole from one or two isolated phenomena. Even though the Tojo cabinet lacks radical colors in personnel and political platform, there are several noteworthy characteristics of the new cabinet itself. First, regarding the rejuvenation of Japanese military affairs and the promotion of national defense production, Tojo has devoted the most effort among successive Japanese Army Ministers. Of the four political platforms he announced the day before yesterday, the item "strengthening domestic military institutions and mobilizing the strength of the entire nation," although listed last, can be believed to be the most central task of the new Japanese cabinet. Second, in the "New Order Movement," which failed under Konoe, the highest ideal was the unification of military and political power. Now that Konoe has stepped down, this ideal has also been realized. However, it is not that politics is unifying military power, but rather that the military has begun to control politics in name and in fact. Third, the position of Japanese Home Minister is of great importance in domestic affairs and is usually held by someone with the qualifications of a Deputy Prime Minister. Now, Tojo serves as Prime Minister, Army Minister, and concurrently Home Minister, concentrating major political and military affairs in one person. Apart from him, there are few strong figures in the cabinet. Apart from the military, almost everyone else is a bureaucrat. This is an extremely authoritarian form of political system, strengthening military power and control over everything internally. All of this is intended to simply emulate Nazi Germany and quickly transform the entire country into an institution suitable for war. This trend cannot be concealed by its moderate appearance.

So, why hasn't it manifested a tense and confrontational stance on the surface? First, because preparations are not sufficient. For the past year, the "Movement to Establish a Highly Developed National Defense System" has only sacrificed the people's enjoyment of the lowest level of life to force Japan, which has a light industry advantage, to embark on the path of developing heavy industry. However, due to insufficient resources and manpower and the heavy pressure of the international economy, peaceful industries have shrunk extremely, and the results of war industries have not been good. The miracle of the United States completing four 35,000-ton battleships in a row this year is something Japan cannot dream of. Second, it must wait for the right opportunity. The Soviet Union has not been completely defeated, and the United States has not yet truly faced a two-front war crisis. If it were to take action against the outside world in such a situation, it would only further stimulate the other party and strengthen its vigilance. And third, and most importantly, it is still necessary to obtain a more favorable strategic situation. If it were to immediately advance southward or attack the Soviet Union, Japan would inevitably face fighting in an environment of encirclement on all sides. Even if Tojo is a proponent of operations against both China and the Soviet Union, he cannot help but hesitate under the current circumstances. In his ideal, he must open one or two sides of this encirclement before attempting to take risks. Therefore, on the one hand, Togu, who has pro-Soviet aims, is appointed as Foreign Minister, and on the other hand, Sugimura makes demands on the United States to continue negotiations. And in its four political platforms, it first put forward the resolution of the "China Incident."

The Lin Senjuro cabinet was once a relatively moderate cabinet in form, but in fact, it formed the ladder for the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. This past event is precisely what the world should be most wary of.

### Battles around Moscow Reach a Stalemate; Red Army in the Center Launches Fierce Counteroffensive; Recapture of Kalinin Not Yet Confirmed

International News Agency dispatch, Moscow, 19th – The Soviet Supreme Command announced yesterday that the fierce resistance of Soviet troops at the approaches to Moscow has inflicted significant setbacks on the German forces. As the battles around the outskirts of Moscow have reached a stalemate, Moscow Radio announced last night, "When Soviet troops rise up to defend their sacred city, they are like a wall of steel." It is claimed that the Soviet 9th Regiment has repelled the German advance in the Vyazma district, annihilating two German infantry battalions. In the past five days, Soviet troops have annihilated 10,000 German soldiers in this area alone.

Reuters dispatch, London, 19th – Winter has arrived in Soviet territory, and the Eastern Front is now covered with ice and snow. Fierce fighting continues, especially in the center. German forces have repeatedly attacked the defense lines around Moscow but have been repelled. According to Soviet announcements, German forces have suffered particularly heavy losses in the Belinsk area, losing 3,000 soldiers, 50 tanks, and a large amount of other equipment in one decisive battle. According to reliable sources contacted by Angara, the unexpectedly fierce resistance of the Soviet forces on the central front has forced the German side to withdraw a large number of troops fighting on the southern front. Therefore, the pressure on General Rabuteni's forces has eased somewhat. Rabuteni's forces are still fighting valiantly around Mariupol.

United Press dispatch, London, 19th – The Red Army High Command broadcast an official communiqué on Moscow Radio last night, which did not confirm the Red Army's recapture of Kalinin, 100 miles north of Moscow, and Orel, 215 miles southwest of Moscow. However, the communiqué stated that Soviet troops fought stubbornly with German forces throughout the day yesterday on all fronts, with particularly fierce fighting on the western front.

Reuters dispatch, London, 19th – The Moscow newspaper Pravda stated that the German plan to encircle Soviet troops in the Belinsk area was anticipated by the Soviet side and dealt with accordingly, so the German forces ultimately failed to achieve the victory they had hoped for. Pravda's reporter in the Belinsk war zone reports daily on the situation in the area and on the southern front. It is said that the German attempt to encircle Soviet troops in Belinsk was repelled. It is difficult to predict how the battles in this area will develop. It is said that German forces have repeatedly suffered heavy losses. German forces on the southern front are now intensifying their attacks on the Donets Basin and the Sea of Azov. Soviet troops are fiercely resisting, and the fighting is extremely fierce. Many villages have been lost and regained repeatedly. At the same time, the German High Command also announced the end of the battles of Belinsk and Vyazma. A special communiqué issued by Hitler's headquarters stated that the battles of Belinsk and Vyazma have now concluded satisfactorily. General Bock's army, together with the air force commanded by General Kesselring, has almost completely annihilated the Soviet troops under Timoshenko, totaling as many as eight armies. Reuters' military commentator said that both Soviet and German communiqués indicate heavy fighting in the past 24 hours, especially in the center. However, the advance on Moscow has not made much progress, indicating the increased resistance of the Soviet troops and the slow progress of the German forces.

### Soldiers and Civilians United in Defending Moscow; Defense of Moscow as Solid as a Wall of Copper

Reuters dispatch, London, 19th – No detailed reports other than official communiqués have been received from the Soviet Union. However, the situation in the past two days has not caused pessimism. The tenacity of Soviet resistance is stronger than the German ambition to advance, giving the Moscow garrison time to arrange defenses. Soviet radio mentioned that the defenses around Moscow are as strong as a wall of copper, indicating that the defense lines around Moscow are deeply layered and not easy to break through.

Reuters dispatch, London, 19th – Moscow Radio broadcasted to Leningrad last night, briefly stating that Moscow will forever be a Soviet city and will not allow the enemy to enter. The enemy is currently deploying many troops to the eastern theater, but we will never abandon this famous city. We are all participating in the defense, and the spirit of the people of Moscow is the same as that of our comrades in Leningrad. We will never abandon the Soviet capital.

### Soviet Union Possesses Vast Military Strength; Determined to Fight to the End

Havas dispatch, London, 19th – Radio stations here broadcast news today, strongly asserting that the Soviet General Staff still possesses 150 fully equipped army divisions, totaling 2.5 million soldiers. These troops are stationed in the Ural Mountains and are actively training. They can be transferred to the front lines at any time to assist in the war.

International News Agency dispatch, London, 19th – The Sunday Express published an interview with Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky today, stating that the extent of British aid to the Soviet Union will determine how long it will take to defeat Hitler. "However, in the coming weeks, no matter what changes occur on the battlefield, the Soviet Union will fight Hitler's Germany to the end. The Soviet people know what the purpose of the war is, so they are united as one and as solid as iron. The two great powers of Britain and the Soviet Union, militarily, politically, and economically, should help each other as needed to achieve success."

### Soviet Garrison Completes Mission; Safe Withdrawal from Odessa

TASS dispatch, Moscow, 19th – The Battle of Odessa lasted for about two months. From the first day to the last, the Red Army and the National Guard repeatedly repelled the German and Romanian forces. The valiant defenders of Odessa have completed their mission of destroying enemy manpower and materiel. The German claim that the Red Army withdrew from Odessa after being pressured by German and Romanian troops is a ridiculous lie. In fact, the German and Romanian forces mobilized 18 divisions and repeatedly attacked the city without success. If the Soviet High Command had not ordered a withdrawal for strategic reasons, the German forces would never have been able to enter the city. This battle cost the German and Romanian forces several divisions, with particularly heavy losses suffered by the 13th and 15th Romanian divisions. In the final battle, these two divisions suffered 6,000 casualties. The Red Army's withdrawal from Odessa was without loss, which proves the perfection of its organization.

### Britain Establishes Strong Base in the Near East; If Nazis Attempt to Invade the Caucasus, Britain Will Provide Military Assistance to the Soviet Union

International News Agency dispatch, London, 19th – News from Cairo released here yesterday stated that British and Indian Army Commander-in-Chief General Wavell has established a strong base in northern Iran and Iraq. If German forces attempt to advance from the Sea of Azov to the Caucasus to seize Soviet oil resources, British forces will launch an attack from the aforementioned base. Sir Croford, of the Army Ministry, declared yesterday that if Germany invades the Caucasus, Britain will provide military assistance to the Soviet Union. It is said that "the test of true strength is about to begin." It is also pointed out that German forces have advanced an average of 400 miles along a 1,400-mile front in Soviet territory. German forces will attack Baden and Baku to control Soviet oil fields. As for Britain, it will also support Soviet defenses in this area, because aiding the Soviet Union is also defending Egypt, India, and the Far East. Labor Minister Bevan stated yesterday that the Soviet Union has now lost a large amount of resources for national defense production, so its situation is indeed very difficult.

### Soviet Union Decides to Move Capital to Samara

Havas dispatch, London, 19th – According to the latest news received here, the Soviet government has reportedly decided to move to Samara.

### Guangdong Christian Organizations Establish Joint Secondary School, Classes Have Begun Successfully

(Hong Kong Dispatch) To facilitate domestic youth enrollment, Christian organizations have recently established the "Guangdong Christian Joint Secondary School" in Shuangxi Mountain, Lian County, Guangdong. The principal is Pastor Guan Enzhu. According to what Mr. Guan told reporters in Hong Kong, the school is jointly run by ten Christian schools and several Christian organizations, including Lingnan, Zhenguang, Zhenzhong, Peiying, Lingying, Xien, Huaying, Xiehui, Guangzhong, and Meihua. Classes began on September 16, with a total of 200 male and female students in both senior and junior high school levels. The school has 35 faculty members, including three foreigners: Professor Paul from National Sun Yat-sen University, and Mrs. Chuan Xin and Ms. Carol, who have already departed from Canada and will arrive soon. To facilitate enrollment for poor students, those who cannot pay tuition are allowed to substitute with rice, paying 100 or 200 catties of rice depending on their grade level. This is a special feature of the school. The school has now set aside 10,000 yuan for scholarships to reward poor and diligent students. It also plans to open an agricultural studies program to cultivate agricultural talent and increase agricultural production. Mr. Guan also stated that Mr. Li Hanshun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, has expressed great welcome to the organization of the school and has offered many words of encouragement, requesting the establishment of branch schools in various places. However, the school is financially strained and has limited capacity, so it is afraid that it will be difficult to meet Chairman Li's expectations. In the current situation, the establishment of each branch school would cost 10,000 yuan in national currency, but we are still willing to make the greatest effort in hopes of establishing a branch school.

This year's Chinese Football League did not stop due to the withdrawal from the Western League. Good news came yesterday, the first match between the Hong Team and Xuhui kicked off. The match was held at Xuhui Public School. Fans were excited, with over 5,000 people attending. The scene along the Xuhui Bridge was unprecedented. The Hong Team is the incarnation of Donghua, showing its strength from the beginning. Xuhui has many rising stars, but they were able to calmly cope with the strong opponent. Goalkeeper Gao Zhiwen and center forward Zhou Defa showed their experience. The Hong Team took the lead 3-1 in the first half, and ultimately won 7-1, defeating Xuhui.

Dai Linjing Scores First

Xuhui kicked off, testing their skills, but it was saved by Banglun. Li Ningquan led the Hong Team's center forward, with Linjing providing support. The Hong Team launched a fierce attack, and Gao Zhiwen made many saves. At 15 minutes, Binghao picked out Linjing who shot low from 15 yards and scored, opening the scoring. Huang Rengui of Xuhui then hooked a player with his foot and was penalized with a penalty kick. Lu Fang missed the shot. At 25 minutes, Lu Fang received a clever pass from Youliang and scored with a header. At 35 minutes, Zhou Defa broke through and scored, making it 1-2. Soon after, Binghao took a corner kick, and Youliang headed it in. The Hong Team led 3-1 at halftime.

7-1, Xuhui Defeated

The second half began, and Ah Dai of the Hong Team retreated to defense. Dianhua was moved to the front line, and Li Ning stepped down. Guodong entered the game. At 16 minutes, Han Longhai hooked the ball into the net, making it 4-1. Zhuang Wenquan scored an own goal, making it 5-1. At 31 minutes, Longhai lightly pushed the ball in, making it 6-1. Lu Fang charged into the box, and because Gu Zhiyi committed a handball, a penalty kick was awarded. The shot was invalid. Zhuang Youren took the penalty, but the goalkeeper moved his foot first, so it was retaken, and he missed again. Finally, Binghao scored again, and the Hong Team won 7-1.

### Applications for Foreign Exchange Not Approved: Stabilization Fund to Reconsider, Designated Operating Banks Have Been Notified, Actions to Collect US Dollars Can Be Suppressed

The Sino-British-American economic conference, held in Hong Kong, concluded on the 15th. British representative Bomb Meier and American representative Kirkland, who participated in the conference, have flown to Chongqing. Members of the Stabilization Fund, Fox, Chen Guangfu, and others, also reviewed and adjusted the working principles of the Stabilization Fund as a result of the conference in Chongqing. Their mission in Hong Kong has ended, and they have returned to Chongqing together. As a result of this conference, news has emerged from the Hong Kong financial community that the following points will be given important consideration: (1) Controlling Anglo-American trade in Shanghai, (2) Strengthening control over finance between Hong Kong and Shanghai, (3) Curbing speculation by Shanghai merchants, (4) Determining countermeasures against the actions of Japan and Nanjing, (5) How to provide effective assistance to the Chinese government. As a result of the Hong Kong conference, more lenient measures have been taken regarding applications for foreign exchange from Shanghai importers.

Good Faith Applications to Be Reconsidered

A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from reliable sources yesterday that all banks in this city holding special certificates from the US government to operate foreign exchange have recently received a notice from the Stabilization Fund, stating that the Fund is prepared to give favorable consideration to applications for foreign exchange in good faith by importers before August 18, which have not yet obtained the necessary backing for trade from any source. Once the amount of foreign exchange to be settled can be allocated to each bank, the Stabilization Fund will make a comprehensive decision on this matter. The financial community believes that most of the good faith applications for foreign exchange will be approved. Under these circumstances, the soaring price of US dollars will retreat to a considerable extent, making Shanghai's trade more regular. However, applicants must answer the following questions, which are included in the application form. The application form first states, "For goods imported before August 18 that lack all or part of the necessary foreign exchange backing, if you intend to request approval for foreign exchange, please submit an application form including the following questions together with the handling bank."

Detailed Items in the Application

(1) Name, address, business, and nationality; (2) Name and nationality of the shipper; (3) Name and nationality of the manufacturer of the goods; (4) Is your bank the owner of the goods? If not, what is your relationship with the goods? (5) Details of the goods, quality, unit price, and country of origin; (6) Date of purchase by your bank or the shipper; (7) Are the goods sold or unsold? (A) If sold, please specify the details of the buyer. (B) If unsold, please state the facts that can be explained and indicate to whom and how the goods will eventually be allocated. If the "final allocation" is already known, what kind of guarantee will your bank provide to ensure that the goods will eventually be allocated accordingly? (8) Where are the goods currently located? (A) If they have arrived locally, when did they arrive and where are they stored? (B) If they are in transit, please provide details about the transportation, such as the name of the ship, date of loading, estimated date of arrival, and destination. (C) If they are still on order and not yet shipped, please specify the expected date of shipment and destination.

Provide Guarantees

(7) How is foreign exchange maintained for the goods? (A) If they have arrived or are being transshipped, is the foreign exchange backing obtained by drafts? (I) Who holds the drafts? (II) When do they expire? (III) Has your bank paid off the drafts in foreign currency or national currency? If not, please explain how the foreign exchange is maintained. Has part or all of the value of the drafts been paid in national currency or foreign currency? (B) If the goods have not yet been shipped, please explain carefully how foreign exchange will be maintained when the goods are shipped, and explain what kind of payment has been remitted to the supplier. (11) Explain how the following items are resolved with foreign exchange. Please answer. (A) The amount obtained, (B) The name of the seller, (C) The date of settlement, (D) If foreign exchange has been obtained from the Stabilization Fund (applied for by the bank), please state the name of the handling bank and the details of the application (if possible, please attach a copy of the original letter) (12) Has your bank paid for the goods in a way other than remittances, such as using export drafts or other methods? (13) Is your bank willing to provide guarantees to the Stabilization Fund regarding the answers to these questions (if the Stabilization Fund requires it)?

Comply with Regulations

(14) Each answer must follow the order of the questions and must specify the item number of each answer; (15) The above questions only apply to goods for which foreign exchange has not been requested before August 18 of this year. The above application form, after being inquired by the receiving bank, should be sent to the handling bank within three days. Please contact the trusted bank for consultation if necessary (signed by the Stabilization Fund Committee). According to what a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency has revealed from the financial community, this new measure by the Stabilization Fund is sufficient to further clarify various disputes that may arise. On the one hand, banks must comply with the regulations of the Stabilization Fund Committee. On the other hand, they must liquidate various foreign exchange application businesses handled on behalf of customers.

### Stock of Miscellaneous Grains

(2) A total of 15 dan of sago flour were shipped to Shanghai, worth 237 customs gold units, equivalent to 642 yuan in national currency. (3) A total of 796,213 dan of wheat flour were shipped to Shanghai, worth 7,038,505 customs gold units, equivalent to 19,053,233 yuan in national currency, most of which came from the United States and Canada. (4) A total of 833,649 dan of unnamed miscellaneous grains were shipped to Shanghai, worth 2,625,581 customs gold units, equivalent to 9,814,448 yuan in national currency, most of which came from the Dutch East Indies.

Banks and firms are extending 70-80% of the loans due until the end of April next year. New credit loans are more than in previous years, with interest rates ranging from 8% to 1.2%, aiming to regulate industry and commerce finance. The Money Trade Association has scheduled an inner plate conference for 2 p.m. on the 25th of this month to publicly decide on inner plate market prices.

Special Preparation for Industrial and Commercial Reserves

Shanghai's industry and commerce, in accordance with the "Special Reserve Measures for Industry and Commerce in Extraordinary Times" promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stipulate that when there is a surplus at the end of each business year, in addition to setting aside public reserve funds, a special reserve must also be set aside. Now that the end of the lunar year is approaching, they have all prepared to set aside reserves themselves to consolidate their own foundation. The methods for setting aside reserves are: (1) For surpluses exceeding one-fifth of the total paid-up capital, 10% of the surplus is set aside. (2) For surpluses exceeding one-quarter of the total paid-up capital, 20% of the surplus is set aside.

Gladetti Returns to San Francisco, Prepares for Shanghai-US Shipping Route, Plans How to Bypass Mandated Islands, Determines Course of Ships Based on Situation

The rumor that the US President Lines' ships will suspend service to the Far East has not been confirmed by any telegrams from the Washington headquarters. However, Assistant Secretary of State Gladetti came to the Far East on August 10th to inspect and study the economic situation and to focus on the issue of shipping in the event of war. It is widely believed that the Pacific situation will worsen. Gladetti is currently the general manager of the US President Lines, and his visit to the Far East must involve a comprehensive consideration of this matter.

Considering Shipping Routes

According to informed sources in the shipping industry, Shanghai is a neutral port. Regardless of whether war breaks out in the Pacific, American ships can, in theory, sail to Shanghai as usual. The shipping route may avoid passing through Honolulu, Hawaii, and Japan from San Francisco to Shanghai. At that time, American ships will sail directly from Honolulu to Manila, then through Hong Kong to Shanghai. However, how to bypass the Japanese-mandated islands that cross the Pacific remains a question worth studying. Therefore, the shipping industry is finding it difficult to make a definitive statement about the future.

Current Voyages

The current voyage of US President Lines ships already avoids passing through Japanese ports when coming to Shanghai, instead changing course to Manila and Hong Kong before arriving in Shanghai and returning to the US. Recent arrivals in Shanghai, such as the President Coolidge, the President Pierce, which arrived on September 23rd, and the President Cleveland, all took the route through Manila and Hong Kong. Only on their return to the US do they pass through Japanese territorial waters from Shanghai to San Francisco. This approach is based on the original voyage plan, but in the event of any action in the Pacific, this route cannot be considered safe. Shipping companies are currently hesitant.

US Hesitation

Mr. Gladetti, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, recently left China and returned to San Francisco. His decision to come to the Far East was to inspect the economy and the repercussions of the war in the Pacific, as well as the shortage of ships and the goods needed in the export market at that time. All of these issues were on Mr. Gladetti's agenda. Mr. Gladetti, not only in his capacity as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, but also in his capacity as manager of the US President Lines, is studying the allocation of wartime-controlled shipping tonnage. Mr. Gladetti has already returned to San Francisco and is working with shipping leaders in Washington to study the navigation of American ships to the Far East and Shanghai at length.

New Ships Arriving in Shanghai

According to the schedule set by the US President Lines, several President ships will sail to Shanghai before the end of November. Although the US Maritime Commission requisitioned seven President ships on June 16th, including the Coolidge, Cleveland, Taft, Jackson, Adams, etc., the order has been increased to twelve ships. Unless the US President Lines headquarters issues special orders, which are unlikely to change, the President Taylor will return from Hong Kong to Shanghai before the 27th of this month. The President Van Buren will join the Far East route on her maiden voyage from San Francisco. According to information obtained by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the General Pershing is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on November 1st, and the General Holbrook will sail from Shanghai to San Francisco on November 17th. Furthermore, although the Panama Line's Purita left Shanghai three days ago, it is expected that the ship will sail to Shanghai again.

Few Passengers on Shanghai-Ningbo Ships

After the Italian merchant ship "Real" was detained and released, it was leased to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, renamed "Hualin," and originally scheduled to sail on the 18th on its first voyage on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. However, due to incomplete procedures, it did not depart as scheduled. It is now learned that the ship is scheduled to sail to Ningbo on the 22nd. The tonnage of this ship is more than twice that of the original "Naruto Maru" that sailed on the route, so it is said that after the official maiden voyage of the ship, the "Naruto Maru" will withdraw and sail on another route. It is also learned that the "Haitong" and "Dahua," two ships leased by the Zhejiang East Shipping Company, have also joined the Shanghai-Ningbo route. There are very few passengers.

### 免費種痘運動 定期開始

Free Vaccination Campaign Scheduled to Begin

The Municipal Council has issued a notice stating that a free vaccination campaign will begin on the 20th of this month. At that time, citizens can request free vaccinations from the following health sub-bureaus near them:

Vaccinations will not be given on Saturday afternoons, Sundays, or holidays. Vaccination certificates for domestic use can be requested from any of the above health sub-bureaus. Vaccination certificates required by travelers leaving Shanghai can only be obtained from the sub-bureau at 340 Hankou Road. Factories wishing to request the dispatch of mobile vaccination teams to vaccinate their workers can apply in writing to the nearest health sub-bureau, but only for workers who are vaccinated at one time with 100 or more people. As for groups wishing to obtain vaccine seeds and hire doctors to administer the vaccinations themselves, they can apply in writing to the director of the Health Bureau for verification and allocation.

### Record of a Visit to the China Underwear Weaving and Dyeing Factory

— Nu

In the past twenty years, the weaving industry in our country has been booming. Even in Shanghai alone, there are factories everywhere. Unfortunately, the war broke out, and seven or eight out of ten were destroyed. Only the China Underwear Weaving and Dyeing Factory has remained intact. Because of the pressing needs at home and abroad, the production volume has increased daily, and the business has become more and more developed.

The factory was established in 1920 and was initiated and organized by Huang Hongjun, a textile expert who studied in the United States and is now the general manager. For more than twenty years, he has been focusing on management and has become the only great factory in China that weaves, dyes, bleaches, and sews on its own today.

The factory is located on Connaught Road, covering an area of more than twenty acres. It is divided into three major departments: weaving, dyeing, and sewing. The weaving department is divided into spinning, warping, threading, sizing, and finishing rooms. There are 565 looms, each equipped with an automatic motor, and can produce more than 1,700 bolts of cloth per day. The dyeing department is also equipped with the latest equipment, including a singeing machine, steaming vat, bleaching barrel, dyeing vat, drying cart, stretching cart, calendering cart, and yarding cart. It can bleach and dye more than 2,000 bolts of cloth per day. The sewing department is located on the upper floor of another factory building. All kinds of machines are used to cut clothes with electric scissors, which can cut dozens of layers of twill thick cloth at the same time. The style is accurate, and the work is fast. After the clothing materials are cut, they are handed over to female workers for sewing. The machine used is an electric sewing machine. Although the form is the same as the sewing machines we usually see, each machine has a small motor installed under it, which can be turned on and off at will with a step. It is said that more than 100 dozen ABC underwear, dozens of raincoats, and double-linked shirts and trousers (that is, shirts connected to trousers) can be produced every day, which are the factory's exclusive products, because it has a special double-linking machine.

The machine room is equipped with various master machines, just like a machine factory. The generator room drives all the motors and needs to burn 18 tons of coal per day. To the right is the water plant, which uses electricity to draw well water into the water tank. This place is like a water plant. Others are warehouses, packaging rooms, and decoration rooms. Looking at the entire factory, the scale is grand, and the layout is well-organized. It is truly a rare weaving and dyeing factory in our country. As for its products, there are more than 50 types of underwear cloth, flannel, indanthrene cloth, yellow twill cloth, serge, and raincoat cloth, which are sold throughout the country and Southeast Asia.

The factory's distribution office is located on Nanjing Road and has a department store, which sells not only the factory's products but also daily necessities and Western-style clothing. General Manager Huang, for the sake of further expansion, purchased more than 400 acres of factory land in Kunshan Chajia Port next to the Suzhou River as early as 1937 and planned to build it in three zones, such as a large factory zone and a staff residential area. The remaining land will be allocated to the shareholders according to the size of their shares as a model village for shareholders' residences. The factory is moving forward, and the future is unlimited.

### 前面紅燈駕車小心 爲新創銀行進一言

Drive Carefully When There's a Red Light Ahead – A Word for Newly Established Banks

— Qi

A bank is like a marriage agency. The task of a marriage agency is to act as a matchmaker, not to meet the needs of single men and women themselves. If it meets the needs of single men and women itself, it is not a marriage agency but a brothel.

A bank's responsibility is to match social idle funds (equivalent to single women) with the need for capital (equivalent to single men), so that each can get what it wants, not to open up convenience for itself. At this time and in this place, idle funds are abundant, which is of course inevitable. But why has the abundance of idle funds become a natural phenomenon? It is precisely because at this time and in this place, there is no legitimate need for capital at all. The recent successive interest rate cuts by various banks are sufficient proof of the business distress of the established banks. With only single men or only single women, a marriage agency has nothing to do. If there are more men than women, or more women than men, even the God of Marriage cannot fulfill his responsibilities. A marriage agency that sincerely works for others should only reduce in this situation, and there is no reason to increase. Unless it wants to take advantage of the needs of single women and play the role of a gigolo to satisfy its bestial desires to play with women. Using this as an analogy to the new banks at this time and in this place, which are like bamboo shoots after rain, I cannot help but worry about the general single women.

This article is specifically written for newly established bankers who sincerely work for others, not with gigolos as the target. If it is a gigolo, it is surrounded by bestiality, and there is really no reason to make an analogy. The author is a member of the banking industry, and all the points he discusses are based on banking business, and the destination is also banking business. Every word is pertinent, every sentence is practical, revealing the subtle and crucial points, and enlightening people to wake up suddenly. The emotions are sincere, and everything is to consider for the newly established banks. If not a banker with authority, how could he say this? The editor dares to tell the readers that the author is one of the most famous contemporary bankers, and the name under the article is only limited to under the article. As the ancient saying goes: Honest advice is unpleasant to the ear, and good medicine is bitter to the mouth. However, discerning people will not ignore these words. (The Editor)

New Banks Springing Up Like Bamboo Shoots After Rain, But Looking Around, There's Nothing to Do

In the past year, the new banks established in Shanghai have been like bamboo shoots after rain, flourishing for a while. According to the author's statistics, there are dozens of them, large and small, that have already opened or are still in preparation.

The above is only what the author knows and is listed in the table. There are unknown numbers of those that have already been prepared but have not yet held an inaugural meeting, or those that have already been initiated but have not yet been completed. Looking at the above situation, it can also be seen that there are so many new banks that it is an unprecedented phenomenon. However, looking around at the facts: What is the current situation in the Shanghai market? Do we need so many banks? Can we accommodate so many banks? And is the emergence of so many banks for the sake of industrial development? Can they develop and grow? In today's abnormally developing market, we really cannot help but say something.

Deposits and Loans are Contradictory, Poor Digestion

The prosperity of the Shanghai market seems to be growing day by day. However, considering the actual situation, industry is not developed, and trade is not prosperous. This superficial prosperity is undoubtedly not a normal economic development but a special phenomenon during wartime. Let's analyze the current market situation: The first factor contributing to the prosperity of the market is the concentration of population. People from the occupied areas are still stranded in Shanghai. The second is the concentration of overseas hot money. As a result of exchange control in various countries, overseas funds are moving to the Shanghai market. The third is the depreciation of currency and the soaring of prices. All industries are making profits. The fourth is the active speculative market, and the number of nouveau riche is emerging one after another. Because there are these factors to support the market, the Shanghai market is booming on the one hand, but on the other hand, it is suffering from excessive surplus of funds. Under such circumstances, the banks' use of funds also first encounters unprecedented difficulties. Large loans are dared not to be made in this turbulent situation. Small overdrafts are rarely needed by industry and commerce. As for hoarding goods, the current prices of goods have already reached their peak. Who dares to take this risk? It is of course not easy for banks to cope with these difficult times. Government banks are tightening their business, which may be an exception due to environmental factors. However, commercial banks have always relied on deposits and loans to make a living. Since loans cannot be made much, they can only make calculations on deposits. Therefore, commercial banks have recently needed to reduce interest rates repeatedly and impose various restrictions on deposits. This abnormal disposition of not welcoming deposits is also precisely to indicate that it is extremely difficult for banks to use deposits currently and that they have to find ways to reduce deposits to lighten the burden. Although the increase in bank deposits is due to the prosperity of the market, if the bank's business cannot keep up with the prosperity, it will only make the bank suffer from indigestion. This phenomenon is ultimately not a blessing for the future of banks.

Different Motives, But the Same Risk

The current Shanghai market is like this, and the bank's situation is like this, but why do emerging banks still spring up like bamboo shoots after rain, regardless of the difficulties and dangers? The reason is:

(1) Clerks Want to Experience the Addiction of Being a Manager Clerks of general banks or money shops are usually underlings and are not easy to rise. Therefore, taking advantage of the current abundance of idle funds, they organize banks under the lobbying of various parties and realize their idea of ​​becoming a manager.

(2) Old Banks Do Not Give Interest on Deposits Most commercial banks currently do not pay interest on demand deposits, while loan interest rates are still around one point per month. On the surface, there is a profit of more than one point per year on a deposit and a loan. Such cheapness is a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity, so it has aroused the interest of various parties in establishing banks.

(3) The Large Number of Nouveau Riche Recently, due to the active speculative market and the prevalence of hoarding goods, many nouveau riche have emerged. These people can organize banks and recognize sufficient shares in a moment's chat after tea and wine.

(4) Industry and Commerce Run Banks Themselves Industry and commerce, in view of the past dealings with banks, have been at the mercy of others in everything. Currently, each industry is thriving, and funds are abundant. Therefore, they run banks themselves. On the one hand, it is for their own funds to move around. On the other hand, it is for industry and commerce to stand up for themselves.

(5) Regarding Banks as a Glorious Career Banks are the head of all industries, and doing banking seems to be glorious. Furthermore, they can take this opportunity to appeal to the public. Those who want to start a business often change to running banks.

(6) The Government's Tolerant Policy The Shanghai environment is special, and the government is far away in the southwest, so it is beyond its reach. The government is too lenient in accepting applications for verification of capital and registration for new banks. As long as there is proof, registration can be approved and a license can be issued. Therefore, the procedures for establishing a bank are easier than before.

Judging from the above factors, it can be seen that the rise of new banks is not really due to the needs of the environment, but because the general public regards banking as a fashionable business, and everyone wants to try it adventurously. Establishing a bank with this mentality, the success or failure of the future is really unimaginable.

### 名目五花八門 業務不脫陳軌

Various Names, But the Business is Still Stale

The establishment of new banks is easy, and the number of them is naturally in line with expectations. This small concession has suddenly increased so many banks, and competition in business is inevitable. However, new banks are not comparable to old banks. Without special characteristics, it is not enough to attract customers. What is the nature of these new banks? It can be understood from their business. The main business of banks is to handle deposit and withdrawal, make various loans, and engage in trust matters. In the current commercial banks, they are generally the same and have no special distinctions. However, among these emerging banks, there are those called commercial banks, those called iron and steel banks, those called tobacco banks, and those called industrial banks. There are many names and various patterns. Their business in commercial banks is to engage in commerce and handle savings and trust businesses, which is of course no different from general commercial banks. In specialized banks, as the name suggests, their scope of business should be limited to a certain industry. However, taking a look at the reality, these specialized banks are still commercial banks in nature and have not reached their specialized level. Even if specialized banks want to achieve business specialization, under the current financial situation in China, it may not be possible to do so for a while. There are quite a few specialized banks that already exist in China, such as the Industrial Bank, the Industrial Bank, the Reclamation Bank, and the Salt Bank, but after decades of struggle, their business has not yet reached the specialized purpose. These emerging specialized banks are certainly not talked about. Therefore, when it comes to the nature of newly established banks, there is nothing special about them, and they are no different from commercial banks. Although there is this specialization as a banner, it is only to appeal to the public and add many specialized bank terms in the banking industry.

With the Elderly on the Road, Banks Take the Lead

A bank is a business organization that relies on doing business to maintain survival. Since new banks have no special characteristics, their scope of business is naturally no different from that of old banks. However, under the current situation, the business of old banks is shrinking day by day: restricting deposits, reducing loans, suppressing deposit interest rates, and saving expenses. This phenomenon is sufficient to show that banks cannot develop externally and can only find ways to remedy internally. If the situation of old banks is like this, how can new banks be an exception? Moreover, new banks have not yet gained credibility, and the difficulties in business are only more serious than those of old banks. The following facts can be used as evidence:

Deposits

Currently, the market is full of idle funds, and it seems that it is not difficult for banks to absorb deposits. On the side of old banks, because of their existing reputation, they can attract deposits, but they have this feeling. However, on the side of new banks, first, their own credibility is not established, and second, there are too many newly opened banks. It is not easy to absorb a large number of deposits. Therefore, new banks often cause competition among their peers because it is not easy to absorb deposits. Because of competition among their peers, the phenomenon of releasing plates to absorb deposits often occurs.

Loans

Loans are the main business of banks and the source of interest. If there are no special reasons, why would they easily give up? The fact that old banks dare not make a large number of loans at present of course has its internal factors, which is also felt by new banks in common. Moreover, judging from the situation when banks make loans: banks simply dare not deal with bad customers. Good customers, in peacetime, if there is a small shortage, banks want him to use money, but they have to buy over the negotiations. Currently, good customers still use very little money. Even if they occasionally lack funds, they have to talk to the bank about the conditions before asking the bank to accommodate them. Therefore, under this situation, bank loans can be said to be mostly the borrower's market. The terms of the loan are opened by the borrower. Old banks' customers are still like this, and in order to promote business, new banks may have to accommodate customers even more. There is no doubt about this.

Other

In extraordinary times, in addition to deposits and loans, the business operated by banks also includes foreign exchange, domestic remittance, government bonds, stocks, real estate, and goods. In the past, many banks made money from this aspect. However, this way of making money is either because the market has declined, or because the changes are small, or because market prices have already reached their peak. Currently, it is either that the doors are closed, or that the risks are heavy. It has been regarded as a daunting task by general banks. If new banks still do it, I am afraid that not only will they not be able to pick up what others have spit out, but they may also end up losing more than they gain.

Where to Fill the Huge Expenses

Therefore, the business of banks is becoming narrower and narrower. What old banks cannot do, new banks may not be able to do. Moreover, old banks are not fools and will not make money. New banks may not have unique eyes and be good at making money. The difficulties in business are the same for new and old banks.

Currently, the situation is turbulent and uncertain, and prices are soaring endlessly, but the banking business cannot develop with it. However, it is quite difficult to maintain the expenses of a bank, especially for newly established banks. In addition to the regular expenses, they also have to spend a huge amount of start-up expenses. Where do these two expenses come from? It is worth discussing.

### Increasing Start-up Costs

Before opening, a bank's largest expense in the first year is for premises and decoration. Bank premises must not only be neat and beautiful, but also located in the city center. Currently, in Shanghai's central business district, businesses stand shoulder-to-shoulder, leaving hardly any vacant space. The few suitable locations for bank branches are even scarcer. To solve the branch location problem, new banks are willing to offer huge transfer fees to secure superior and well-appointed premises. Consequently, transfer fees are driven higher and higher, and bank start-up costs also increase significantly. In the current situation, it is not surprising that a new bank spends ten or twenty thousand yuan on transfer fees, decoration costs, and the like. If the bank's capital is only one million yuan, then before opening, its liquid assets have already been reduced by 20% or 10%. Whether a new bank can bear this is a serious question.

### How to Secure Regular Expenses

Recently, prices have soared, and the cost of living has increased daily. Banks' regular expenses have also grown substantially. As a public service, banks cannot excessively cut costs. For a small-scale bank, even with the most economical calculations, monthly expenses would likely not be less than 25,000 yuan, and annual expenses would not be less than 300,000 yuan. The question is, where will this 300,000 yuan in expenses come from? Let's analyze it. Banks rely on deposits and loans to survive, using the interest rate difference between deposits and loans to offset expenses. New banks cannot offer no interest, or only nominal interest, like established banks. Therefore, their interest rate spread is likely only around 3%. Assuming deposits are ten million yuan and loans are also ten million yuan, the income and expenses would balance out. However, in reality, not all deposits can be loaned out, and due to the unstable situation, most deposits are demand deposits. Banks must retain some reserves. If five million yuan of the ten million yuan in deposits are kept as reserves, the income from operating the remaining five million is clearly insufficient to cover expenses.

The above only applies to medium-sized banks. The situation is even more dire for small banks with a capital of 500,000 yuan or large banks with a capital of 2 million yuan. Assuming a simple break-even scenario in operations, the current situation is already stretched thin. How can they maintain long-term sustainability? It is truly perplexing.

Enthusiastic During Founding, Dumbfounded After Research

Judging from the circumstances when new banks were founded recently, the founders are enthusiastic, and investors eagerly participate. On the surface, it seems that running a bank offers great profits. However, upon closer examination, banks face increasingly difficult circumstances, and business expansion is impossible. Expenses are growing rapidly, and how will the profits and losses be balanced? The future is fraught with difficulties, and running a bank is not an easy undertaking. Moreover, with the current uncertain situation and the superficial market, storms and rains can strike at any time. If a new bank's foundation is unstable, it is in danger of collapse. Therefore, in such an environment, the only way for new banks to survive is to stabilize their foundation and advance slowly. The most important methods for stabilizing the foundation are: (1) Do not overextend business, (2) Strive to save on expenses. Of course, at the beginning of a new bank, it is necessary to seek more business, and when prices are soaring, it is impossible to save on expenses. Undertaking it is quite difficult. However, how to handle this dilemma depends on each bank's own decision. The author is merely revealing the facts and analyzing the advantages and disadvantages. New bankers are not short of intelligent people and should be able to respond well.

### Reflections on the Essay Contest on Filial Piety Sponsored by the YMCA

— Yi

The Shanghai YMCA's Junior Group has designated the previous month as "Filial Piety Month" since last year. This year, they are holding an "Essay Contest on Filial Piety" as usual, which is truly meaningful. We naturally sympathize with and are happy to support this initiative to promote traditional morality. Filial piety is inherently a virtue. Everyone, whether in childhood, middle age, or even old age, must do their best to be filial while their parents are alive. If parents are psychologically troubled, spiritually distressed, or economically in need, children should do their best to find ways to alleviate their concerns and put their parents at ease. This is the first condition for conducting oneself in the world, establishing oneself, and practicing the Way. If a person cannot fulfill their filial duty to their parents, I can assert that this person will not make great contributions to society or the nation. Throughout history, there are countless examples. Think about it: our parents are the first benefactors who gave us life and raised us. To be unfilial to one's parents is to forget one's roots! How can a person who forgets their roots be trusted? However, in addition to filial piety, we should also distinguish between knowledge and ignorance, right and wrong. If parents engage in rebellious or immoral behavior, children should directly admonish them to avoid future harm. Therefore, filial piety must also have its limits. Blind filial piety is absolutely unacceptable.

The British humorist and playwright George Bernard Shaw had a perspective on raising children. He believed that parents raising children is a form of investment in society, and society should later demand from these children the rewards they owe. I believe this view is excellent. Then, when we practice filial piety, wouldn't it be even better to expand the scope and serve society?

If we ourselves have become parents, then we should work hard to cultivate ourselves and create a rational family life. Otherwise, how can we pass on excellent character to our children?

My Family Problems

### Excerpts from the Essay Contest: My Problem of Remarriage

— Wushuang

After three years of companionship, my wife, who was ill for a long time, finally quietly passed away. What she left behind was a three-year-old child who didn't yet understand human affairs. On one side, there was a husband living a solitary life; on the other side, there was a lonely father. This has been going on for more than a hundred days.

Although my mother came from the countryside to take care of my food, clothing, and daily life, and to raise this poor child, a problem is clearly looming: "Remarriage."

Not long after my wife passed away, many relatives and friends came to talk to my mother, to talk to me about matchmaking. This is undoubtedly well-intentioned. However, on my side, my parents have only one son, and the child has only me, the one who loves him the most. I used to be an extremely ambitious person. Although that ambition gradually diminished after entering society from school and gaining a slight understanding of the ways of the world and human hearts, I still want to struggle while I still have energy. A family is naturally needed, but how to form that family is worth considering.

Some people say, "You are remarrying, so you should be more flexible in choosing a spouse." The wife is the husband's support in times of success, his comfort in times of disappointment, his lifelong companion, and his only confidant. In what things can you be flexible? Can you be flexible in choosing a spouse?

Others say, "The first condition for marrying a wife is that she has a good temperament." Yes, for the sake of my child, the new wife naturally needs to have a good temperament. Although she cannot treat the child as his biological mother, she must not abuse or discriminate against him. But in reality, how many stepmothers do not abuse or discriminate against children? Nine out of ten matchmakers will say that this girl has a good temperament, but after marriage, she may treat other people well, but not you; or she may treat you well, but not the child. Then it will be "too late to regret."

Others say, "To find a spouse who meets your ideals, you must go out and socialize." Indeed, many happy couples are formed in the arena of love! But I don't have that kind of interest. Moreover, although I received the latest education, I still feel like a Chinese person and don't quite agree with the latest forms of socializing and the concepts of men and women.

So, I can only rely on other people's "matchmaking." However, when the issue of men and women reaches the stage of "matchmaking," marriage is not far away. What I want is to seek mutual understanding through this, and then talk about marriage after a considerable period of time. "Understanding" is not a "promise." I can't casually agree, but the matchmakers are so sincere, and those being matched are so serious, I am afraid of delaying other people's youth.

Therefore, my method is limited to the first impression or even a photo of the other party, and a few words of introduction from the matchmaker. Isn't that even more difficult?

I can apply formulas and check tables to solve a problem in natural science. I can also refer to books and consult experts to come up with an answer to an international problem. But I can't answer the problem of "remarriage."

Thinking of my deceased wife's voice and appearance, stroking my child's round face, I suddenly realize that I am still young. Let's wait a few years before talking about this problem. (Contribution to Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund)

Editor's Note:

It is truly commendable that Mr. Wushuang can consider his problem of remarriage so thoroughly and do his best to think about his child. I hope he can continue to use his calm mind and passionate paternal love to choose his future spouse.

I don't know if Mr. Wushuang's deceased wife was married through matchmaking or how the couple's feelings were. When getting married the second time, at least he can avoid the mistakes of the first marriage. American marriage experts often ask this question when examining whether a marriage is happy: "If you were to marry again, would you marry someone like your current wife?" I would like to ask Mr. Wushuang to ask himself.

In modern times, choosing a spouse should be done with caution. It is best to choose one from several women (women should also use the same method to choose a husband). Relying solely on a photo and a meeting is too dangerous.

Many people now advocate that the time between getting to know each other and getting engaged should be long, and the time between getting engaged and getting married should be short. Mrs. Shan'e is one of those who advocate this. As for formal socializing, it is very noble. Mr. Wushuang doesn't seem to want to insist.

Finally, I am very moved by Mr. Wushuang's love for his child.

### Protecting Eyesight

— Bai

To protect eyesight, don't make the light too bright or too dim. The light should come from over the left shoulder.

Do not lie down to read, and do not read in moving vehicles. If you must use your eyes constantly during the day, you should not use them too much at night. Every fifteen minutes of reading, look into the distance for a while and often rotate your eyeballs left, right, up, and down.

### A Week's Menu of Everyday Dishes

— Ms. Huaying

Chop pork or beef finely to make minced meat, commonly known as "thousand-cut meat." Some people, for some reason, never eat thousand-cut meat in their lives. In fact, thousand-cut meat is not bad at all and is easy to digest. Many dishes and snacks also require thousand-cut meat. For example, cabbage heart with crab roe lion's head, minced meat with tofu, mashed potato and beef patties, shao mai, soup dumplings, tangyuan, shui jiao, guo tie, etc., are all very delicious dishes and snacks. Isn't it a pity not to eat them? In this era of expensive rice and firewood, it is already very fortunate to have meat to eat. You must not be picky and complain too much. In a family, every husband should know this to avoid making it even more difficult for the wife in charge of the kitchen to plan the daily meals.

Celestial Kitchen Recipes (77)

Holding a crab and admiring chrysanthemums has always been regarded as a joyous and elegant affair. Now, the "gutless gentleman" (crab) is running rampant in Shanghai from various production areas. Regardless of the season or flavor, everyone wants to enjoy a good meal. However, while the taste of crab is good, proper cooking is especially important. Therefore, I will publish various methods of eating crab in this recipe to add to everyone's enjoyment.

### (139) Roast Crab

— Draft by Xu Yangzhen

Ingredients: Perilla, ginger, Zhenjiang vinegar

Instructions: The method for cooking roasted crab is the most common, but there are a few points to note. Add perilla when cooking to detoxify it, and embed a slice of ginger on the crab's belly button to dispel its coldness. Before cooking the crab, tie it with hemp rope into a tightly bound package. Do not immerse the crab in water when cooking. Instead, use a steamer rack or a bamboo basket to prop it up and steam it. This way, the cooking method will not cause the crab to lose its freshness because it is immersed in water. When eating, do not forget Zhenjiang vinegar and minced ginger.

### (140) Crab Stuffed with Pork

— Draft by Cao Fukun

Ingredients: Crab, lard, salt, wine, ginger, soy sauce, fennel

Instructions: Wash the crab, open the back, embed a whole piece of lard, place it in a bowl, add salt and wine, put it in a pot and simmer. Once cooked, it can be eaten.

Dear friends: If you want to purchase "monosodium glutamate," "essence of Celestial Kitchen soy sauce," and oil, salt, medicine, and vinegar, please call "44594," and a special messenger will deliver it immediately without charging a delivery fee.

Family Mailbox

This publication originally planned to set up a family mailbox and is in the process of planning it. Recently, however, we received two letters from readers, and in fact, we have to reply immediately.

Ms. Jiaying: Your brother-in-law is suffering from loneliness, so he naturally needs you as a companion. However, Ms. Jiaying, in your current position, you should use your reason more and not act on emotions, because you are in a very important position. It's not just about the present, but about your next few decades. How are you and your brother-in-law in terms of interests, are your temperaments compatible, how much is the age difference? If you get married, can you have a happy married life? These are all things you should consider. If you have the value of getting married, naturally it's not impossible, but you must go through the proper procedures to ensure that you have solid protection. Do not let emotions cloud your reason. If you think there is no possibility of marriage, then you can explain your difficulties to your brother-in-law frankly and ask him to respect your will with the passion of loving your sister.

Ms. Guaiguai, it's great that you and your half-sister have good feelings, but you don't have to focus on formalities. Feel free to look for opportunities at any time. Why rush? At the same time, you can use appropriate methods to resolve the bad feelings between her and your mother.

Spring and Autumn

### Saving a Poor Child

— Weisun

Every day, we receive many letters from readers and never neglect them. Small problems are solved immediately. What makes us most heartbroken and difficult to solve is the appeal of general impoverished readers. If we ignore it, we suffer the condemnation of our conscience. If we want to help them, we don't have an ideal solution. Often, there are several difficult events on the desk. After reading the sincere and sad letters, we turn them over and over, and finally, we cannot easily throw them into the wastepaper basket. As a result, we try our best within our personal means to find ways to help them separately. Some are especially asking friends for help, and some are pointing out a path.

Last night, a reader wrote that last spring, a neighbor sent over a newborn baby boy. They were very happy to adopt him. They feed him milk powder every day. Now he is growing up, smart and lively, and very lovely. Unfortunately, this child recently fell ill. They consulted both Chinese and Western doctors, and the prescriptions have accumulated to dozens, enough to be bound into a small account book. The writer's financial situation was originally extremely difficult, and he has spent a huge amount of medical expenses and has exhausted all resources. Now that the child's illness is improving, but he is absolutely unable to afford the cost of diagnosis and treatment, he hopes we can think of a way to save a poor child. He said that he couldn't bear to see a lively child end his life after a short journey in life.

We were moved by him. After some consideration, we didn't want to appeal to readers publicly. We have already asked a respected doctor to solve this problem. Our agreement with the doctor is that the medical expenses will be completely waived, and he will do his best to diagnose and treat the child. However, it is necessary to investigate the writer's situation who appealed to us.

Saving a child is not difficult, but how to save countless people who are "poor and have no one to turn to"? That's what we think.

### Local Scenery: "Speculation"

— Cai Jiedong

What is this place? It is the oil market. Recently, life has become more and more difficult, and even basic things like pancakes and fried dough sticks have to be sold for ten cents each, and they are getting smaller and smaller. This is the situation created after going through here:

"Naturally! The market will continue to rise. Short sellers are embarrassed, hahaha!"

"How long will it rise?! Speculation, speculation, it's terrible!"

"Only buying in, no selling out. Can you still start? The market is going to be terrible."

So, there are many people buying oil in the streets and alleys.

Not long ago, it was only selling for a little over one yuan per catty. In a few days, it quickly rose to two yuan and a few cents, with daily restrictions. The words that the seller refused multiple purchases were used to regulate prices. The oil bought at two yuan and a few cents is very different from the oil at a little over one yuan. The oil color is brownish-yellow and cloudy. I don't know what it was mixed with. Insiders say it is mixed with Qing oil. Qing oil is refined from cottonseed, which is the lowest grade of oil. No one eats it much, but what can you do?

At this time, some people who uphold justice came out to speak. This is almost the old rule. Aren't you in charge of what you say, and I'm in charge of what I do? Who is willing to be in charge? The current time is an extraordinary period, not like normal times. On the other hand, public officials are fighting among themselves. This is happening between bulls and bears. The bulls are greedy and insatiable, and the bears are desperate. How much rice will be lost is still unknown. The bears are obviously a little overwhelmed and want to hang up the "no war" sign. At this moment, the momentum of the bulls is strong, so how can they give up? What's the solution? It's terrible too!

One day, at the entrance of the market. Suddenly, there was an unusual discovery... In order to ensure safety, the market announced that everyone was prohibited from selling short, and advised both parties to compromise. Somehow, someone suddenly said that this was completely the conspiracy of the short sellers, or perhaps the bulls were unwilling, and they insisted again.

Don't care about them! Most people are sighing:

"It's getting harder and harder to be a person!"

The majority of people are manipulated by a minority of people, but this world does not belong to a minority of people. The sky will not be dark forever. One day, it will be easy to be a person.

### Safety First

— Ge Liang

A girl earnestly asked her grandfather about his age, got a satisfactory answer, and then asked him if he had teeth.

"Yes."

"Um!"

"But there are only a few left, and those teeth are useless."

"Can you chew hard things?"

"No, no, even soft foods have to be chewed for a long time before they can be swallowed. How..."

"Then, Grandpa, can you keep this bag of peanuts for me?"

Thirteen: Wandering to Shanghai

"Child, Nanjing is certainly a good place, but compared to Shanghai, it is ultimately a little worse. Let's not be indecisive anymore!" Because Mei Sai wanted to find a suitable organization to join in Nanjing after arriving in Shanghai, or go to a war wounded hospital to be a nurse, to both make a living and contribute to the nation. But Qiu Haitang did not think it was very appropriate, so before leaving Xuzhou, he repeatedly explained it to her.

Since the incident of Shang Laoer, Mei Bao has been particularly filial to her father. After listening to him say this several times, she no longer insisted on staying in Nanjing.

"As long as Dad wants to go, I will always follow you!"

"I think Shanghai is not as good as Nanjing. I still have a few acquaintances there. It's not that I necessarily like that place." Qiu Haitang thought of those old officials who desperately supported him in the past, and he felt a little hope in his heart. Of course, he did not hope that people would send him dowries, diamond rings, write articles, or even embed his photos in the newspapers, but he thought that as long as one of these people could use one percent of their previous kindness again, then his and Mei Bao's life would not be a problem.

For me, life always chooses the easy path, just like moths must flutter towards the light.

In less than half a month, Qiu Haitang and his daughter wandered to this world-famous metropolis. But Qiu Haitang's pocket only had eleven yuan left. (240) (End of Chapter 13)
