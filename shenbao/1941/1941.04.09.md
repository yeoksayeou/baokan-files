### Initial Victory of the Southern Armies: Occupies Three Important Seaports in Italian Territory; German Forces Launch Blitzkrieg in Northern Greece; Greek Army Withdraws from Thrace Due to Strategic Considerations

London – It is rumored that Yugoslavian troops have penetrated the borders of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania with lightning speed, but this has not yet been confirmed. According to sources in Xiongcheng (likely a transliteration of a foreign city), the Southern armies are currently exerting heavy pressure on Italian forces who are putting up strong resistance in the mountains northeast of Scutari in Albania. It is reported that Greek forces have been staunchly resisting the powerful German offensive in the Struma River basin and the surrounding highlands. German forces are using tanks, heavy artillery, and bombers. Two Greek fortifications in the Struma area have been destroyed by artillery fire after fierce resistance. Furthermore, a Xiongcheng dispatch states that Italian forces are awaiting German assistance. When the Italian forces retreated from Zara on the Dalmatian coast, they abandoned a large quantity of military supplies. Considering the vast operational range of the Yugoslavian air force, the number of pilots and aircraft lost is remarkably small. It is rumored that the Southern armies entered Scutari on Sunday. Other dispatches indicate that Fiume in northeastern Italy has been occupied by the Southern armies. A Greek communiqué stated that strong positions have been occupied on the Albanian front, and 500 enemy soldiers and a large quantity of military supplies have been captured. Meanwhile, a Reuters correspondent stationed in Greece reports that most of the British troops arriving in Greece have been transferred directly from the Libyan battlefield, fully equipped and ready for combat anywhere.

New York – Columbia Broadcasting Company broadcast news from Tokyo stating that the Southern armies have occupied Fiume (northeastern Italy), Zara (Dalmatian coast bordering southern Italy), and Scutari (Albania). (Reuters, 8th)

London – A broadcast from Ankara was heard here yesterday, stating that the Southern armies have begun a lightning-style offensive against Hungary, capturing the Italian port of Zara and Scutari in Albania. The report regarding the Southern armies occupying the port of Zara has not yet been confirmed. The Southern armies' blitzkrieg against Hungary is advancing towards Zagreb. Scutari is located in Albania, 20 miles from the Adriatic coast. The Ankara broadcast essentially indicated that the Southern armies are attempting to drive the Italian forces into a trap formed by the Greek southern army and the British naval forces along the coast. It also stated that the Southern armies have begun a large-scale offensive against the Italian forces on the Albanian border. The radio station also stated that the Southern armies first bombarded with heavy artillery before attacking Albanian territory. The station further reported that the Southern armies have opened fire on the border between the two countries of Southern and Albanian, in preparation for an invasion of Albania. (United Press, 8th)

New York – Columbia Broadcasting Company received a broadcast from Ankara last night stating, according to confirmed sources, that Yugoslavian troops have occupied the Italian seaport of Fiume on the northwest coast of the Southern nation. Fiume was ceded to Italy in 1924 after a fierce dispute through the efforts of the famous Italian poet and soldier Gabriele D'Annunzio. Yugoslavia recognized the cession by treaty on April 5, 1925, and granted Hungary the right to use Fiume as a free port. Fiume is located on the Adriatic Sea, where Yugoslavia borders Italy.

Berlin – The Greek observation line on the Greek-Bulgarian border was captured by German stormtroopers at dawn on the 6th. Although the Greek forces offered some resistance, they were defeated by the German forces, and the first trench fell. German aircraft heavily bombed the area, shaking the mountains. Most of the observation posts were destroyed by bombs. The Greek forces continuously returned fire with machine guns, but the German troops bravely charged and are believed to have occupied the Greek observation posts one by one. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

New York – According to broadcasts heard here last night by NBC, German forces have advanced from Eastern Thrace to the Aegean coast, forming a wedge between Greece and Turkey, thus separating them. German forces have occupied the border region in eastern Greece bordering Turkey, thus cutting off the only point of contact between Turkey and the Greek mainland. We can now realize that if Turkey wants to assist Greece, it must be prepared to attack the German forces on this Turkish-Greek border. (United Press, 8th)

Athens – An official war communiqué recently announced that Greek artillery has frequently fired heavy shells across the important Rupel Pass, repelling repeated attacks by hundreds of German tanks, which were advancing under the cover of low-flying bombers. However, the low-flying aircraft guarding the tanks were also forced back by intense anti-aircraft fire. Even though German forces concentrated artillery fire, aircraft, and tanks to launch vicious attacks, the Greek forces have stopped the German forces in the most important areas. However, Greek forces in western Thrace have withdrawn due to strategic considerations. As the Greek artillery fired shell after shell, fiercely bombarding these seemingly terrifying monster German tanks, and the teams holding all the main fortresses, many German tanks have been destroyed. The communiqué also stated that the Greek forces on the Albanian front are still advancing. However, the Greek forces on the Thracian front have retreated for military reasons and to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. The area of retreat is now guarded by small detachments of Greek troops. On the Albanian front, the Greek forces adopted a strong offensive and occupied several important positions of the Italian forces, capturing 500 Italian soldiers. All the supplies abandoned by the Italian forces were captured by the Greek forces. The communiqué also stated that two fortresses in western Thrace, named Ischino and Nefeia, are still resisting the enemy and preventing their entry. Furthermore, the German forces attacked Lisborg on the Greek-Bulgarian border west of Macedonia, with tanks assisting in the battle, but they were repelled by the Greek forces, and many of their tanks were destroyed. On the heights of Navrokopp, the enemy forces entered the fortress of Beritoli after a strenuous attack. However, after a fierce battle in the tunnels, most of the German soldiers who entered the fortress were annihilated, and the fortress remained in the hands of the Greek forces. In the Struma Valley, the garrisons in the two fortresses of Istinbe and Karkal fought until only one person remained. The two fortresses were then destroyed. Lupel, Akisia, and Laven were attacked several times by tanks and aircraft, but intense artillery fire finally repelled the enemy forces. (United Press, 8th)

### 150,000 German Troops Launch Large-Scale Invasion of Greece: Bloody Battle Unfolds at Rupel Pass

Zurich – There was a major battle at the Rupel Pass in northern Greece last night. 150,000 German troops concentrated in one place, carrying out Hitler's blitzkrieg. British air force heavily bombed the German troops on the mountain road and engaged the German air force in battle, vying for control of the airspace over the mountain pass. The German army admitted that the Greek army's resistance was very strong. Another 150,000 German troops attacked Yugoslavia from the two countries of Bulgaria and Romania. A third group of 300,000 German troops attacked the Southern nation from the northern border. Italian forces also dispatched 100,000 troops from Italy southward to attack the northern border of the Southern nation. The Allied forces resisting the German army in all directions totaled approximately 2 million people, including 1 million from the Southern army, 80,000 from the Greek army, and 100,000 to 300,000 from the British army. (United Press, 8th)

Athens – News from the Greek-Bulgarian border last night stated that although the German Nazi army launched a large-scale invasion, it has not yet broken through the Greek army's defense line. It is believed that the Yugoslavian army is also resisting the German army's attack. Unconfirmed news stated that the Yugoslavian army captured more than a dozen German tanks. Military observers believe that the general living situation is still satisfactory. The high command also broadcast an announcement on Greek radio, stating that the Greek army is holding its position on the Bulgarian front, but the fortresses of Ishtiba and another one in the Struma River basin have been occupied by the German army. The German army launched a fierce attack on the Rupel Pass but has been repelled. The German army once rushed into the Thilidor of Nivipinosantou, but "after struggling within the fortress, the Thilidor was wiped out, and the fortress returned to Greek control." It also stated that on the same day, a large German army launched a frontal attack on the Struma River and Ryu Ken, and fierce battles were launched on the peaks of Niviro Kopp. It was also stated that countless German tanks attacked Lispa Fort, but many were destroyed by the Greek artillery. (United Press, 8th)

### Greek Suicide Squad Fights Against Overwhelming Odds: Entire Unit Sacrifices Themselves on Greek-Bulgarian Front

London – According to a dispatch from a Reuters special correspondent with the British army in Greece, details of how a Greek suicide squad of 150 men, led by a corporal, fought against 20 times as many German troops, resulting in the sacrifice of the entire unit, were released today. This small number of Greek soldiers blocked the German army from breaking through the most important part of the Greek-Bulgarian front. It is said that when the German army launched a full-scale attack, the Greek commander called for a suicide squad to remain at the front and hold a mountain ridge with all their might, so that the main force could calmly transfer to pre-arranged positions in the rear. All the soldiers eagerly participated, and the corporal selected 150 men. After being selected, they set off, first destroying a bridge and destroying several enemy tanks, then, with extraordinary courage, holding the front positions to resist the enemy's fierce slaughter. They fell one after another until the entire unit was killed. (Reuters, 8th)

### German Use of Paratroopers Encountered Failure: All Captured in Macedonian Region

Athens – A Greek official spokesperson stated last night that on Sunday, German planes carrying paratroopers and leaflets flew to Macedonia to drop them. Some of the paratroopers have been captured. The leaflets dropped by the German planes proclaimed that "Germany is friendly to the Greek people, so we hope the Greeks will not suffer the horrors of war." The spokesperson also stated that the main German offensive was in the areas of Beers and along the Struma River basin. While the Greek army was resisting another invasion, multiple German divisions used various modern mechanized military equipment to attack the Greek army from the rear, starting from Beers along the entire border, but did not succeed in breaking through. The Greek soldiers on the front line resisted fierce artillery fire, destroyed invading tanks, and launched a counter-offensive. Greek aircraft shot down six German aircraft, with no losses for the Greek aircraft. The Italian forces in Albania did not engage in any activity, apparently intending to reap the benefits of others. Athens Radio broadcast a Greek military headquarters communiqué last night stating that the German offensive continues unabated, and small Greek teams are adding resistance. The people of western Selos are currently withdrawing as usual. Greek forces on the Albanian front continue to attack, capturing 500 enemies. (Reuters, 8th)

### Military Cooperation Between Britain and Turkey: Turkey Allows Britain to Use Its Territory as Air Force Base

Istanbul – Britain has indicated that Turkey may soon declare war, but will not take offensive action. Well-informed sources say that a large amount of British military supplies have recently arrived in Turkey. Britain claims that Turkey will take a defensive stance militarily, but will allow Britain to use Turkish territory, at least as an air force base, and will allow British ships to pass through the Dardanelles Strait to the Black Sea.

Editorial

### The "Blitzkrieg" in the Balkans

Germany and Italy had no choice but to simultaneously attack the two countries of Southern and Greece with a large amount of force. This move was actually due to the pressure of the current situation, which declared the complete failure of the various machinations, persuasions, and threats they had recently made. This is also admitted by Germany's spokesperson as a situation that its enemies attempted to bring about. What is worthy of world attention is that the Soviet-Southern non-aggression pact was signed on the eve of this war, which shows that this German-Italian action clearly went in the opposite direction to the basic interests of the Soviet Union and its desire to maintain peace in the Balkans. This is what the German-Italian side has always tried to avoid, and what the British and Greek nations now feel comforted by. Therefore, after the outbreak of the Balkan War, two unfavorable new situations immediately appeared in front of Germany and Italy: First, the German-Italian group will have to fight on both the eastern and western fronts of Europe at the same time in the future; second, the existing friendly relationship between the Soviet Union and the Southern nation has gradually become strained. If the war is prolonged, the possible adverse effects on Germany and Italy in the future development will be unimaginable. For Germany and Italy, the supreme strategy of this Balkan gamble should be to resort to the so-called "blitzkrieg tactics." General observations in the past two days have also believed that their greatest attempt now is to replay the Polish campaign two years ago.

At the beginning of the Polish campaign, the first step of the invading army was to bomb transportation hubs, industrial areas, and densely populated cities on a large scale, so that the entire territory of Poland immediately fell into chaos. Secondly, it immediately launched a three-sided encirclement of it, and launched a fierce attack to break through the defense line along many routes at the same time. As a result, in less than a week, it was found that there were more than a dozen offensive routes, making the Polish defenders overwhelmed, and in less than two weeks, the entire war machine of Poland disintegrated. This dazzling and fierce tactic is still deeply etched in everyone's memory. In this Balkan War, in addition to the brutal bombing of the two countries of Southern and Greece by Germany and Italy for the past two or three days, which has been carried out fiercely; on the land front, at least seven offensive routes have also been discovered, and the situation is almost exactly the same as the above-mentioned Polish War. Geographically, Germany and Italy occupy a three-sided encirclement of the two countries of Southern and Greece: In the east, Germany, based on Bulgaria, began to attack along four routes. In the north, it divided into three routes to attack, one based on Romania, two based on Hungary, and three based on Austria. As for the west of the two countries of Southern and Greece, it is under the threat of Italy and Albania, and the long coastal area along the Adriatic Sea, if it is within the reach of Italian forces, can be landed at any time and anywhere.

The battle results of the past three days are not very clear now, and the future victory or defeat is of course unknown at present. According to various reports, Germany is said to have used about 500,000 troops in this battle; while the Yugoslav army is probably around 1 million, and the British troops landed in Greece also reached 600,000. In addition, plus the military strength of Italy and Greece, this is undoubtedly brewing a big war. As for strategy: Germany and Italy absolutely need a quick decision. No matter what the source of the German side's statement that it has abandoned blitzkrieg tactics, Germany and Italy must expect the blitz to be effective and go down in one fell swoop. As for the British, Southern, and Greek Allied forces, it is fundamentally different from the other side. The most important task at present is to stabilize the situation, so as not to repeat the mistakes of Poland. Once the Nazi army's "blitzkrieg" edge is frustrated, the war can gradually enter a prolonged situation. In this way, half of their greatest goal of resisting the war will be achieved. Therefore, it is said that the capital of the Southern nation has moved south, and it is of course necessary for strategic reasons, so as to obtain closer contact with the British and Greek armies. Furthermore, in terms of Greece, the most urgent thing is the land where it connects with Turkey and Britain in terms of the sea and the land, so it must defend the Turkish-Greek border passage and the sea ports at any cost. The most important thing for Yugoslavia is to protect its southern territory bordering Greece, and at the same time try to prevent any landing attempt by Italy, so that it can always maintain contact with the British army from the sea and receive supplies from the United States. Therefore, the significance of the Southern army's offensive yesterday to attack the free city of Fiume, Italian-owned Zara, and Scutari in Albania at the same time lies in this.

The basic weakness of Germany and Italy's strategy in this Balkan War is that, first, they were not prepared for this war on the Balkan Peninsula, especially against Yugoslavia; second, the blitzkrieg is no longer the latest strategy, and the other side has experience in dealing with it. Even in terms of "blitzkrieg," there are three major obstacles: First, the dispersion of German and Italian military forces. In addition to defending the 2,000-mile coastline along the northwest coast and the eastern border with the Soviet Union, they must also garrison defense troops in the conquered areas. It is now almost impossible to concentrate large-scale troops for a fierce attack like against Poland. Second, geographically, the mountainous areas of Southern and Greece are different from the western plains of Poland. And the most important third obstacle is that the British Navy almost completely controls the seas of the two countries of Southern and Greece, so that supplies can be continuously increased. According to what British Mediterranean Fleet Commander Cunninghame said not long ago, the Italian fleet suffered losses in the two major battles in Toranto and the Ionian Sea, plus other small contacts. Two-thirds of the battleships are gone, and more than 50% of the cruisers and destroyers are lost, and the submarine losses are 20% to 30%. Under the absolute advantage of the British fleet, Germany and Italy will find it difficult to put the two countries of Southern and Greece in the same predicament of foreign aid being cut off as Poland.

Finally, it must also be pointed out that the air force strength of the British, Greek, and Southern sides, with unlimited supplies from the United States, is by no means comparable to Poland more than two years ago. Judging from the above, the possibility of Germany and Italy's blitzkrieg tactics succeeding in this battle is very slim.

### Greek-Southern Border Will Become Major Battlefield, Terrain More Dangerous to German Forces

London – Today's news from Istanbul states that the section where German troops pass through Thrace to the Aegean Sea is enough to show that German troops have formed a wedge between Greece and Turkey to prevent any reinforcements from the sea for Greece and Yugoslavia. The Germans may also launch a flank attack on the Greek forces fighting in the Struma River basin and the Navrokopp highlands. This side attack must follow the railway from Sande to Darama and Sears to progress, but we dare to believe that the British-Greek high command must have foreseen this threat and have full preparation. The main war is in the Navrokopp Plateau and the Struma River basin, and the war in Mount Ruppel is of great importance. Thessaloniki is at least the object of these wars, but even if the Germans actually cross Mount Ruppel and enter the plains of the Struma River basin, its difficulties cannot be said to be over, because the terrain of the road to Thessaloniki suddenly rises to more than three thousand feet, and on this kind of terrain that has become a natural barrier, Greek troops can also deploy defenses to reject the German army, and the German transport line passing through the Lugel Pass is also afraid that it will be frequently bombed by the Allied forces. Military personnel here all unanimously believe that the German offensive against Yugoslavia seems to focus on Skopje, the main transportation center. If it is occupied by the German army, the contact between southern Yugoslavia and the rest of the country will be severed. (United Press, 8th)

### Southern Army Forced to Withdraw from Southern Servia, Causing Greek Army Left Flank to Lose Cover

Athens – The Yugoslavian army in southern Servia is withdrawing under great pressure, causing the Greek army's left flank to lose cover. The Greek army is currently fighting hard to make up for this gap. (Reuters, 8th)

Capital of Syria – According to telegraphic dispatches received here, the Northern Army of Yugoslavia is withdrawing to the Sava River according to plan. Although there are as many as twelve divisions of German troops concentrated in Bulgaria, they cannot all be used to attack the Southern nation, because the Greek government has concentrated troops in the Maritza River area in the eastern end of the Thracian region. The German army must allocate some troops to pay attention to the war on this front. (Havas, 8th)

Rome – The Italian radio station sent out news this morning saying that the Greek army's attempt to make contact with the Yugoslavian army in Albania has failed. One division of the Greek army was completely wiped out, and our army intercepted a large number of prisoners and military supplies. (Havas, 8th)

### Southern Capital Bombed Five Times, British Planes Heavily Bomb Bulgarian Capital in Retaliation

Berlin – A Haitong News Agency interviewer recently learned from responsible personnel that the German Air Force carried out the fifth bombing of Southern national airfields and the Belgrade Fortress today. The German dive bomber group and fighter group heavily bombed the airfields in the Topola, Palanka, Urosevac, and Pristina areas, achieving remarkable results. The dive bombers attacked the Grattisk Train Station and the railway near Novisad leading to Zagreb, the important town of Krott, destroying a train station and two trains. As for the Belgrade Central Railway Station, it has been completely destroyed by bombing, and countless military buildings have caught fire. Among the aircraft parked at the Topola Airfield, 14 were destroyed. At the Urosevac Airfield, 12 were destroyed. At the Pristina Airfield, 6 were destroyed by machine guns. (Haitong, 8th)

London – After German aircraft bombed the Southern capital, the British Air Force quickly responded and bombed the German troops concentrated in the Bulgarian capital on Sunday night. The train stations, railway intersections, warehouses, and motor transport vehicles in the area were heavily attacked, and explosions and fires occurred in many places. A certain truck was blown into the sky by the bomb. After the British aircraft finished bombing, they flew back to the Struma River basin and made diving sweeps of targets and heavily damaged motor transport vehicles. All the attacking British aircraft returned safely to their original defenses. News from the Axis side stated that Southern aircraft bombed several towns in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. The Hungarian side said that ten Southern aircraft attacking places like Schietin "and attempting to attack the Hungarian capital" were shot down. The Bulgarian Air Force issued a communiqué declaring that "the two undefended cities of the Bulgarian capital and Kostandil" were attacked. Telegrams from Rome also stated that Southern aircraft had attacked at least three cities in the western part of Vienna: Dussoffa, Arad, and Timisoara. News from the Axis side also stated that the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania had protested to the Southern nation. (Reuters, 8th)

New York – A radio station here recently broadcast news stating that, according to news from the capital of Southern Slav, that country's aircraft groups flew to Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary this month and bombed many strategic points. A second air raid alarm was issued in the Hungarian capital at 9:45 am today and was lifted after 20 minutes. (Havas, 7th)

### China Expresses Deep Sympathy for Greece and Yugoslavia's Resistance; Japan Closely Monitors European Developments, Says Implementing the Alliance Is Not Yet Under Consideration

Chongqing  Local newspapers here are paying close attention to the developments in the Balkans, and express deep sympathy for Greece and Yugoslavia. "Central Daily News" stated that Germany's invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia is not as easy as the invasion of France. There is no doubt about France's internal divisions, while Greece is united. Yugoslavia also has the hope of unity. Now British troops have landed in Greece, the United States has announced full assistance to Greece and Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union, knowing that Germany is about to invade Yugoslavia, suddenly concluded a non-aggression pact with Yugoslavia, which is noteworthy. Germany's current decision is taking a major risk, and the result may cause a major military change in the European situation. The spirit shown by Greece and Yugoslavia deserves our greatest admiration. We are willing to express sincere sympathy and look forward to their victory. "Saodang News" said that the recent developments in the Balkans are enough to show: (1) The military, political, and economic aggression pressure of Germany cannot be stopped unless it encounters military defeat. (2) All countries realize that compromise or surrender to the aggressor is suicide, and they are determined to fight back. The power of anti-aggression countries has been strengthened as a result. All those who are sacrificed by aggression are encouraged by the resistance of Greece and Yugoslavia. Now they will definitely rise up to resist the aggressors. The resources of the Axis powers are gradually exhausted, and their morale is weakening, especially Italy. The result will be a new development in the European situation. If the Balkan war is prolonged, the collapse of the Axis powers may be accelerated. Whether Japan will take the risk of starting a war with Britain and the United States to help Germany at this turning point in the European situation is what must be decided now. Japan should know that the unity of the anti-aggression forces will make the collapse of the Axis powers inevitable. (Reuters dispatch from the 8th)

Tokyo  At the opening of today's meeting of provincial governors, Prime Minister Konoe gave a speech, saying that Japan hopes for an early restoration of international peace. The basis of Japan's diplomacy is the Tripartite Pact, which goes without saying. Japan aims to strengthen cooperation with its allies in order to contribute to the restoration of world peace. According to Ishii, a spokesman for the Information Bureau, the Japanese government is very concerned about the new war in the Balkans and is carefully monitoring its development. Japan's economic interests in Yugoslavia are indeed very small, but Japan pays close attention to the political relationship of the new war. Ishii, fearing that reporters would ask questions, preemptively stated that he could not comment on whether Japan would implement the Tripartite Pact in the German-Yugoslav war, because the Japanese government had not yet considered the question. He heard that Germany had not yet notified the Japanese government regarding the implementation of Article 3 of the Pact in the German-Yugoslav war, so the Japanese government had not considered this point. Ishii also said that news from Berlin reported that when Yugoslavia signed the protocol for joining the Tripartite Pact in Vienna on March 25, it guaranteed that Yugoslavia would obtain access to the Aegean Sea under the new European order, including Yugoslavia's sovereignty over Thessaloniki and the harbor. He knew nothing about this. Foreign Minister Matsuoka had no real information about this matter. (Reuters dispatch from the 8th)

### Analysis of the Soviet-Yugoslav Non-Aggression Pact: The Nazi Desire to Dominate Europe Will Sooner or Later Be Opposed by the Soviet Union

New York  The Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Yugoslavia a few hours before Germany invaded Yugoslavia. It had previously blamed the Bulgarian government for allowing German troops to enter Bulgaria. All these facts should be regarded by Hitler as the beginning of Slavic provocation in the Balkans. The relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany is gradually returning to the hostility between Frost Somren and the Romanovs. Hitler's desire to dominate Europe will sooner or later be opposed by the Soviet Union. Stalin's expression of dissatisfaction with Bulgaria was expected, but it was still thought that he would send a secret diplomatic note, and he would never have expected him to make a public protest. The pact he signed with Yugoslavia was even more important. Stalin's attitude is based on the Soviet Union's opposition to the spread of war, but when the war expanded to Greece and Germany attacked Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium, the Soviet Union did not publicly criticize it. Stalin's dissatisfaction lies in the expansion of the war. The Soviet Union seems to be paying attention to Asia Minor and the Balkans. The general opinion is that the Soviet Union cannot fight Germany at this time, but if the war continues for another year, this situation may change. (Associated Press dispatch from the 8th)

### Britain and Greece Announce Severance of Relations with Hungary; At the Same Time, Germany, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Bulgaria Also Sever Diplomatic Relations

London  A Reuters diplomatic reporter learned that because Hungary has become a base for war against the Allied countries, the British government has decided to withdraw its representative in the Hungarian capital and has instructed British Minister to Hungary O'Malley to lower the flag and return home. (Reuters, 8th)

New York  It was learned here yesterday from a British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast that Greece has severed diplomatic relations with Hungary and Bulgaria. (Associated Press dispatch from the 8th)

Berlin  Yugoslav Ambassador to Germany Dr. Andrić and embassy staff, as well as Yugoslav journalists, left here by train yesterday afternoon. Greek Ambassador to Germany Langarba was also seen leaving here yesterday afternoon or this morning. It is understood that Argentina has agreed to take care of Greek interests in Germany, Switzerland will take care of German interests in Yugoslavia, and Sweden will take care of German interests in Greece.

### British Forces in Libya Continue to Retreat East of Benghazi; British General to Establish Military Government in Abyssinia Due to Chaotic Situation There

Cairo - Official reports state that the vanguard of British forces in Libya continues to face pressure from the German-Italian armies and is currently retreating to designated areas for concentration. Simultaneously, the British siege of Massawa in Eritrea is progressing, while British forces continue to advance smoothly toward Taishi and Yeda, capturing over 10,000 enemy soldiers and seizing a large amount of war equipment since March 25th. The city of Taipilamakesi in Abyssinia (approximately 90 miles northwest of the Abyssinian capital) is now under British control. Patriotic Abyssinian forces, who played a major role in capturing the city, have inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy, with over a thousand killed or wounded. The enemy is retreating southward and being pursued by British forces. British forces have also seized a large amount of war equipment in this area. Following the occupation of the Abyssinian capital, battles are now taking place on the northwest, south, and other fronts. A British spokesperson stated yesterday that British forces are retreating east of Benghazi in an orderly manner, awaiting an opportunity to counterattack. British forces are currently in contact with the enemy east of Benghazi, but the situation in that area remains unclear. It is reported that in Massawa, Eritrea, East Africa, the Italian commander, after consulting with British representatives, refused to accept the British surrender terms. British and Free French forces are now attacking the port, with many believing that the Italians are merely stalling for time to carry out sabotage, especially the destruction of port facilities. In Abyssinia, after the Italian forces in Taipilamakesi abandoned the city following the defection of Abyssinian leader Hailu and his troops to the British, the strength of the patriotic Abyssinian forces around the Abyssinian capital is expected to increase rapidly. In Tigray Province, several thousand troops led by Abyssinian Sain have also surrendered to British forces after the fall of Asmara. Generally speaking, Asmara is now completely controlled by British forces. (Reuters, 8th)

Life in the Abyssinian capital is quickly returning to normal. It has now been revealed that the important Italian commander, General Santini, narrowly escaped capture twice. It is also reported that Italian Governor Aosta and Italian military officers are leading troops north. (Reuters, 8th)

London - Organized Italian resistance in Abyssinia has collapsed. Britain intends to establish a military government in the country. The Empress of Abyssinia told Associated Press reporters yesterday at her residence in Bath, "I can fly to Addis Ababa at any time, waiting only for my husband's summons. I very much wish to ride alongside him on his favorite white warhorse as he enters the Abyssinian capital for a victory parade." Emperor Selassie's whereabouts are currently kept secret, but the Empress says she receives telegrams from him frequently, with one stating he hopes to reach Addis Ababa by the end of April. The British government will likely establish military rule in Abyssinia, but this military government will consult with the Emperor on matters of governance. The situation in Abyssinia is currently very chaotic, requiring strong measures to govern. (Associated Press, 8th)

### British Chancellor of the Exchequer Presents This Year's Budget to the House of Commons; Total Expenditure Reaches 4 Billion Pounds; Income Tax and Other Taxes Insufficient to Cover It

London - British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kingsley Wood presented this year's annual budget to the House of Commons yesterday, stating that the measures he proposed would not only enable Britain to sustain its current difficulties but also maintain a solid foundation for national finances, allowing for postwar reconstruction and social improvement plans in the future. British financial stability has been strong, and the steps taken to encourage exports and reduce non-essential imports have proven effective. Britain's foreign exchange control system and the requisition of U.S. dollar securities have enabled Britain to meet large-scale dollar needs. Now that the United States has backed Britain with the Lend-Lease Act, Britain has a guarantee of purchasing from the United States without difficulty and without hindering its combat capabilities. Britain's control over domestic capital mobilization has been extremely valuable, enabling the government to raise bonds on very favorable terms, with interest rates averaging below 2%. In the future, even as the war continues, it is not intended to raise bonds at high interest rates. We also hope to obtain even better bond terms, all of which are intended to alleviate the postwar financial difficulties arising from war debt and to facilitate the financing of postwar urban reconstruction. This war is the most expensive war in history, resulting in unprecedented difficulties of all kinds. We have found ways to prevent war profiteering. What we must control is the danger of excessive purchasing power surging due to government wartime spending. If we do not absorb excessive purchasing power through taxes to control its impact, this problem will be unsolvable. The government's strict financial plans have largely avoided the adverse effects of unrestricted inflation, and the danger of inflation has not yet occurred in British finance. The estimated revenue and expenditure for this fiscal year are as follows:

Total expenditure is £4,207,000,000. Revenue includes £605,000,000 from income tax (an increase of £81,000,000), £80,000,000 from surtax, £82,000,000 from estate tax, £14,000,000 from stamp duty, and £220,000,000 from excess profits tax, totaling £992,000,000 from domestic taxes. Customs duties are £578,000,000, and purchase tax is £70,000,000, totaling £1,636,000,000. What is expected of the public now is to minimize personal expenses and increase lending to the nation. Income tax is basically increased from 8 shillings and 6 pence per pound to 10 shillings per pound, an increase of 1 shilling and 6 pence. There are flexible measures for those with low incomes, while those with high incomes will be taxed more heavily. Thus, a married man will be taxed 45 shillings per week. Those who did not pay income tax last year will now have to pay 2 shillings per week, but the amount paid will be credited to their account at the Post Office Savings Bank and refunded after the war. As for those with very high incomes, they will have to pay 19 shillings and 6 pence per pound in income tax and surtax, leaving them with only 6 pence per pound for personal use. An individual must have a gross income of £66,000 to have a net income of £5,000, but today there are very few with such a large income. A married man with two children earning £350 per year paid only £5, 8 shillings and 4 pence last year, but under this year's new budget, he will have to pay £24, 7 shillings and 6 pence in income tax, an increase of about £19, but he can receive £47, 6 shillings and 8 pence after the war. The more taxes paid, the less will be recovered after the war. Thus, a married man with two children earning £1,000 per year now has to pay £300 in income tax (an increase of £90), but only £48 will be credited to the savings account. The total estimated income tax revenue for this fiscal year is £605,000,000. Last year's actual income tax revenue was £524,000,000, a record high, exceeding the original budget by £13,000,000. The excess profits tax remains at 100%. This tax is intended to absorb profits made from the war, preventing the increased industrial output caused by the war from becoming a shortcut for personal wealth at a time when the entire nation must sacrifice, as was the case during the last war. However, for the sake of postwar reconstruction, it is proposed that 20% of this 100% excess profits tax be refunded to industries after the war to assist in their postwar reconstruction. The total budget expenditure for this fiscal year is estimated at £4,207,000,000, not including supplies under the U.S. Lend-Lease Act. Last year's expenditure was £3,884,000,000. If overseas expenses for the self-governing dominions, India, etc., are excluded, domestic expenditure is approximately £3,700,000,000. This amount is covered by various tax revenues of £1,636,600,000 and private savings of £1,600,000,000. The shortfall of £500,000,000 will be covered by the new tax rules generating £250,000,000 annually and the new private savings scheme generating over £200,000,000. Domestic expenditure in the first year of the war was £2,058,000,000, in the second year it was £3,190,000,000, and now it has reached £3,700,000,000, demonstrating the continued expansion of Britain's war effort. The reason why the U.S. Lend-Lease Act supplies are not included in the budget is that the British budget is based on cash. The Treasury has a major responsibility to prevent increases in the cost of living. Shipping and insurance costs, etc., will be prevented from increasing. The government will continue and expand its policy of stabilizing prices. Coal prices, gas and electricity prices, and general employment will be maintained as they are, preventing inflation. In addition to announcing income tax, surtax, and excess profits tax measures, the Chancellor of the Exchequer also presented a revised compulsory savings plan by economist Keynes and announced the abolition of the medicine tax from September 2nd, but there were no proposals to increase taxes on tobacco and alcohol. The budget figures presented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer are indeed staggering, but the people have long been prepared to cope with even higher taxes. (Reuters, 8th)

### Matsuoka's Stay in the Soviet Union to be Extended

Moscow - Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka stated yesterday that he may extend his stay in Moscow. He also stated that he does not believe that there are any changes in the Far East situation at present that require him to return to Tokyo. Matsuoka began consultations with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday at 4 p.m. (9 p.m. Shanghai time). Before the meeting, Matsuoka stated upon arriving here that he would discuss general issues regarding Soviet-Japanese relations with Molotov. Matsuoka said he was prepared for a longer stay in Moscow. He was originally scheduled to leave Moscow on April 10th, but he will extend his original trip "if extending the visit proves beneficial." At the same time, he learned the full details of the Soviet-Yugoslav non-aggression pact when he arrived at the German-Soviet border on Monday. He also said that he believed this treaty would not affect German-Soviet relations. Matsuoka accepted an invitation from the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, to have lunch at the embassy at noon on Monday. Steinhardt passed through Tokyo on his way to the Soviet Union and was entertained by Matsuoka. On Tuesday, he was invited to attend, accompanied by the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, several of Matsuoka's aides, and U.S. and Japanese embassy staff. (Associated Press, 8th)

Matsuoka expressed sincere satisfaction with the German and Italian hospitality and thanked Hitler, Mussolini, and the foreign ministers and dignitaries of both countries for their friendship and kindness.

### Japan Deeply Wary of the Soviet Union

Tokyo - Asahi Shimbun commented on the future of German-Soviet relations after the conclusion of the Soviet-Yugoslav non-aggression treaty, stating that since the Soviet Union's first line of defense is now securing the safety of the Tatar Strait and the mouth of the Danube, the Soviet Union will, to the extent possible, suppress Germany with all its strength. Under the guise of a "policy of peace and neutrality," the Soviet Union is gradually gaining political advantages in the Balkans. Future actions by the Soviet side must be carefully monitored, but German-Soviet relations are not in immediate danger. Kokumin Shimbun raised "suspicions that the Soviet Union and the United States have already reached an agreement" and warned Japan to be wary of future actions by the Soviet Union and the United States.

### Random Thoughts on the European War (43): The Inside Story of Wartime Germany

In Berlin, the act of flirting with women on the street has suddenly disappeared. This is partly because the blackout makes it difficult for both men and women to see each other clearly, making it hard to make a move. It is also partly because Hitler has taken on the responsibility of protecting the wives of soldiers at the front. One day, a man who swindled 16 marks from the bride of a soldier at the front was sentenced to death and executed.

Even in peacetime, German women's clothing has always been simple and unattractive. But last fall, those who traveled to Germany saw that the clothes they wore were no worse than before. The current clothing ration for German women is 150 points (compared to 100 points last year). This is not enough for them to make a new dress every other year (each dress requires 60 to 85 points), because the remaining points must be saved to buy shirts, socks, handkerchiefs, and gloves. But German tailors are quite capable, and they can turn old clothes from the previous year into a new outfit. Although the Germans have occupied Paris, German women prefer the fashion styles of New York. This fall, I was surrounded by female German friends because they heard that my wife had left six or seven American fashion magazines with me when she visited me in Berlin. They treated them like treasures.

In the eyes of German housewives, the German occupation of France and Belgium is a godsend. They are only allowed to buy six pairs of socks per year, so they had planned to go barefoot in the summer to save socks. But that didn't happen. Last May and June, before the war had ended, millions of pairs of French silk stockings poured directly into Germany. In the cool of autumn, the number of silk stockings purchased by German housewives was the largest in their lives. German soldiers simply used worthless paper marks to buy silk stockings and send them home. The German postal service specially prepared several cargo trucks to deliver packages of goods to the soldiers' wives, daughters, and lovers. In late autumn, I traveled to France and Belgium, and all the shop owners, even in small towns, pointed to the empty shelves and sighed. All the silk stockings, women's underwear, and fragrant soaps, etc., had been completely bought up. The Germans need soap the most. Since the war began, only a kind of soap that looks like rough soap has been sold on the market. That thing is as rough as gravel, like the soap provided in factory washrooms. German women say that while this thing removes dirt, it is very harmful to the skin.

If the war drags on, the clothing problem for Germans will become very serious. All the cotton used in Germany is imported from abroad, and almost no wool is produced domestically. If you want to exchange for a new coat, you must first take your old clothes, and the old clothes must be so tattered that the authorities will agree to exchange them for a new one. German fur is very scarce. Fur must be worn until it is beyond repair before one is eligible to buy new shoes. If a person wants to buy a new set of clothes, they must spend two-thirds of their annual clothing allocation. In this way, they can no longer buy new underwear, socks, shirts, undershirts, handkerchiefs, and gloves. Textiles are also quite scarce in Germany, which even affects the military. Even thick coats cannot be made. At the beginning of the war, the Germans distributed uniforms looted from Czechoslovakia to the engineering corps in the army. Fortunately, these uniforms were modern, and there was no need to bother dyeing them. The so-called "Todt Organization" members, who were forced to work in the front lines, numbered in the hundreds of thousands. They did not wear uniforms. When I saw them on the front lines, these people were only wearing tattered casual clothes. As for the clothes worn by ordinary Germans, they are made of a kind of substitute fiber. 80 million people keep their bodies warm in this way.

The problem of people needing clothes to keep warm was particularly important last winter. At that time, the weather was severely cold, the worst in nearly a century. Most families and offices did not have fires for weeks. When the people get cold, the morale of the people is shaken. Last summer, the government supplied the people with 80% of the coal left over from the previous two winters (which were not severely cold). On the other hand, the people felt the hardship of not having a stove in the winter, so they started storing coal in the summer months. But the government always hopes that God will help, and that the winter will not be too cold, and from summer to autumn, except on Saturdays, the people are forbidden to take hot baths. In the city of Berlin, the only place where you can always get a hot bath is the Adlon Hotel. At that time, tourists were limited to foreigners. Last winter, my room was filled with German friends for several days. They were either waiting to take a bath or to warm up.

The lack of hot water or unheated rooms in Germany is not due to a lack of coal. Germany has a large amount of coal, but two-thirds of its transportation depends on canals, and last winter and this year, all waterways were frozen. Railway transportation is extremely busy and has no time to transport coal, because the German forces on the Western Front must be well supplied, and even those stationed on the "Eastern Frontier," facing the "friendly" Soviet Red Army, cannot be allowed to go hungry.

### Food Prices: Taking Advantage of the Southward Advance Rumor, Imported Rice Sees Another Surge

If imported rice stocks are high, the market should be stable. However, after domestic traders added purchases and speculators became active the day before yesterday, market sentiment became tense. Although arrivals continued yesterday, buying interest was even stronger, and major players both inside and outside the industry were absorbing stocks. Holders took the opportunity to raise prices, and old rumors about port transport being blocked and ships heading south were revived. Prices for all current rice grades rose across the board in tandem. Afternoon trading resulted in an overall increase of one or two yuan compared to the previous day. Huilong and Huasi small-pattern rice also rose by two yuan. Current small-pattern rice opened at 129, and speculative buying intensified in the afternoon, further tightening market sentiment. Number 1 Saigon rice even reached 115 yuan. Prices for all other rice grades uniformly rose by one or two yuan again. Total daily volume increased to 30,000 bags. At closing, Number 1 Saigon was at 113-114 yuan, Number 2 at 111 yuan, followed by 109 yuan. Number 1 Hualate was at 111-112 yuan, Huowen at 112 yuan, followed by 110 yuan, small-pattern rice at 108.5 yuan, 108 yuan, medium at 107.5 yuan, Tokyo polished long-grain at 102 yuan, followed by 100 yuan, broken long-grain at 88-89 yuan, followed by 84-85 yuan, and Min Party at 108-109 yuan.

Although owners of various grades of domestic rice, such as thick and thin japonica, saw imported rice surging, they also considered taking the opportunity to raise prices. However, due to weak buying interest in domestic stores, it was difficult to keep pace with imported rice. As a result, prices remained flat. Changbang high-quality special japonica opened at 120 yuan, special japonica at 117-118 yuan, high at 116 yuan, Kunshan high-quality white japonica at 115 yuan, followed by 109 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice at 109 yuan, 108.5 yuan.

Glutinous rice traditionally follows imported rice. Currently, not only are retail sales brisk, but major players are also absorbing stocks, resulting in a wide distribution. Holders are raising prices aggressively, with selling prices increasing by one or two yuan along with imported rice. Hong Kong special glutinous opened at 106-107 yuan, large market at 104-105 yuan, medium grade at 102 yuan, glutinous green bean special at 99 yuan, followed by 97 yuan, and broken glutinous at 91-92 yuan.

### Flour Market Remains Strong

Wheat Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour market continued to be strong. Due to rising rice prices and heightened tensions in the Pacific, market sentiment was generally firm. Holders were generally inclined to maintain prices. Bird & Flower brand Australian flour and Golden Dragon brand Canadian flour once reached 29 yuan, but as retail sellers released some stocks, prices fluctuated between 28.8-28.9 yuan. Other brands were also stable. Total market sales of Canadian and Australian flour were over 10,000 bags, all sold to retailers. Chinese factory plain flour remained at 25 yuan, with over 5,000 bags distributed by Fuxin Factory, the shortfall supplemented by imported flour.

Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market was as calm as usual. Domestic wheat supply has long been dwindling, and due to a lack of overseas shipping capacity, trading companies cannot accept orders for imported wheat. Wheat market transactions have essentially stopped. Currently, Japanese factories are not absorbing stocks from retail outlets. Old prices remain between 45-46 yuan. Amid rising rice and flour prices, the market has become more stable.

### Miscellaneous Grains Speculation Rises Again, No Oil Cake or Miscellaneous Grain Untouched by Price Increases

Yesterday, in the oil, bean cake, and miscellaneous grain market, people's minds were swayed by rumors, and the "kick the ball" business flourished again, causing market prices to be chaotic and unclear, creating alarming waves and many twists and turns. As a result, Dalian oil was intentionally cornered by the yarn and flower gangs due to a shortage of spot chips (a portion of over four thousand barrels of newly arrived goods were still being tested due to excessive moisture and could not be delivered). The market price soared by four to five yuan. Transactions included 300 barrels of spot goods, 1,400 barrels of futures, and 200 dan of factory oil. Peanut oil trends were flat and lackluster. Soybeans suddenly rose by two yuan. Tianjin beans, due to ample supply, only increased by six or seven jiao. Transactions included 1,400 to 1,500 bags of various beans. Bean cake futures and spot trading totaled over 26,000 pieces, with prices rising by four to five jiao. Corn rose by two to three yuan. Transactions included over 5,000 bags of spot goods and 400 tons of futures.

Yesterday, 1,000 cans of soybean oil were shipped from Tianjin. Today, 250 bags of soybeans and 500 bags of raw kernels will be shipped to Hong Kong. Additionally, 2,040 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Singapore.

### Finance Payment Settlement for Kerosene and Imported Cotton, Foreign Exchange Tightens

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed rates remain stable. The unofficial markets for British and American currencies showed a trend towards tightening, as the rumors from the previous day proved unfounded. The opening price for American currency was soft, and there was substantial real demand from foreign firms, such as payment settlements for kerosene and cotton. Speculators slightly covered their short positions. However, there were offers from outside firms seeking profit, so the situation in the middle remained relatively stable. By the close, British gold was at 3 pence 25, and the American exchange rate was at 5.34375 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 0.015625 and 0.03125 compared to the previous day. Futures for British currency were flat, while American currency weakened slightly.

Short Covering Also Occurs

In the morning, the London prime rate and the Bank of America rate, as well as the price of London raw gold, remained unchanged. Exchange rates were flat except for the Shanghai-US dollar rate, which rose by six fen. Central Bank listed rates remained the same. Banks' morning spot selling prices were 3 pence 265625 for British gold and 5.34375 yuan for the American exchange rate, compared to the previous day, British currency was flat and American currency tightened by 0.03125. After the opening, the market situation was calm and unchanged. Chinese banks absorbed May American currency at 5.375 and 5.34375 yuan from firms seeking profit. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The silver balance also remained flat. Afterwards, the foreign firms had settlement needs for items like kerosene and cotton, causing the market to soften. It is estimated that outside firms bought May American currency at 5.34375 yuan in April and May. At that time, immediate sterling was already tightening to 3 pence 25. After this, trading became sparse, and fluctuations were flat. By the close, rates were 3 pence 15 and 5.34375 yuan.

British Merchants Still Providing Supply

The after-market situation was calm. Foreign firms continued to buy, accounting for this month's Central Bank sterling at 3 pence 25. Later, speculators and brokers also settled April and May American currency at 5.34375 yuan, all supplied by Messageries Maritimes. At the same time, a certain bank also absorbed this month's American currency at 5.34375 yuan from its peers. As a result, both spot and futures for British gold closed at 3 pence 25. The spot rate for American currency was 5.34375 yuan, and the futures rate was 5.3125 yuan. Compared to the previous day, the British exchange rate tightened by 0.015625 for spot, while futures were flat. American currency weakened by 0.03125 for both spot and futures.

### Foreign Currencies Rise Slightly

The market price stabilized. American gold notes rose after an initial drop, having once fallen to 2 jiao 4 fen before immediately increasing. In the evening market, it reached 18.4 yuan, a rise of 1 jiao 1 fen compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes showed a trend towards firmness, with market prices rising. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes both trended firmer, with the former reaching 1.97 yuan and the latter reaching 1.62 yuan.

### Swap Period Ends, Gold Market Covers Shorts and Rises

Yesterday's silver dollar unofficial market saw the market rebound and strengthen as the rumors from the previous day subsided and the exchange market tightened due to foreign firms settling payments. The evening market trended especially firm, exceeding the 6,500 yuan mark. This was because operators, seeing that the swap was based on the American currency settlement price, continued to discount by 50 to 60 yuan, causing general short positions to be covered. Hengji and Kangyong absorbed particularly large amounts, and Da Feng also absorbed frequently. As a result, the market rebounded by 50 yuan. Total transactions amounted to approximately 16,000 to 17,000 taels. Spot transactions were quite active. Xiangxing, Yongxian, and Xianghe accounted for 190 taels, rising by 180 yuan. Chengji accounted for 60 taels, and Yongcheng accounted for 50 taels, both rising by 180 yuan. Yuxing, Yongxing, and Yongcheng each followed with 50 taels, rising by 175 yuan. Later, Tianyuan sold 10 taels to Tiancheng and Shunyuan sold 30 taels, with an increase of only 170 yuan. Later, Litae and Jin Feng sold 40 taels, rising by 180 yuan, approximately 80 yuan higher than the previous day. Ornamental gold and customs gold remained flat.

Silver Dollar Rises by 50 Yuan

In the early morning, each bar (ten taels) opened steadily, first reporting an opening price of 6,470 yuan, 15 yuan higher than the previous day. It then rose another 5 yuan. Rencheng Yong bought at 6,475 yuan. However, selling pressure suddenly increased, with Tianyuan adding to its short position and Xinfeng Yong closing its long position. The price briefly fell to 6,460 yuan. Subsequently, Tongkang Yong, Hengji, Chengji, Defu, and others competed to absorb and cover short positions. Da Feng also bought in. Before long, the exchange market continued to tighten, and the price gradually rose to 6,488 yuan. After 10 o'clock, Xin Yuan and Xianghe emerged as long players, and Xinfeng Yong and Shun Yuan also sold off. However, there were still buyers at this time, causing the market to fluctuate between 6,488 yuan and 715 yuan. By the close, the price was 6,485 yuan. The after-market opened again at 6,485 yuan, subsequently falling slightly by 3 yuan. However, Hengji Tongkang Yong resumed covering short positions, and Da Feng continued to buy. However, Chengji, Xianghe, retail investors, and others sold off, causing the price to rise to 6,497 yuan before returning to flat. Ten minutes before the close, due to the renewed entry of Hengji Tongkang Yong Da Feng and others, retail investors rushed in, and the price momentarily rose to 6,510 yuan. Later, Xinfeng Yong Decheng Deda sold off, falling by 7 yuan. However, the closing price was 6,505 yuan, resulting in a rise of 50 yuan compared to the previous day. Based on the April American dollar settlement price of 5.3125 yuan, it was 6,555 yuan 3 jiao, with a difference of 50 yuan 3 jiao. After the close, it rose again to 6,510 yuan, and finally to 6,508 yuan. The high and low points for the entire day also differed by 50 yuan. The selling price of cash shop's own brand gold was 200 yuan higher than the silver dollar futures price. The closing price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for spot standard gold.

Price of Ornamental Gold Unchanged

The price of silver shop's ornamental gold for each tael was 680 yuan, quoted by Datonghang and Xintonghang, and remained unchanged. The purchase price decreased by 40 yuan, it is said.

### Yarn and Cloth Long Positions Deliberately Spread Misinformation, Double Horse Ships Outward, Market Price Re-enters the 400 Yuan Mark

The yarn market has shifted from circumlocution to upward movement. This is due to the long positions releasing news that a batch of Shuang Ma (Double Horse) yarn is being shipped overseas for sale. In addition, miscellaneous brands of yarn are steadily advancing, which has especially boosted morale. However, sales through Hong Kong channels are still mediocre, with only 270 bales of various yarns being purchased. Therefore, the short positions remain unmoved, and the market condition still does not show signs of tightening. However, the long positions, observing the daily promotion of Shuang Ma, are trending higher in sentiment. There are quite a few who are taking long positions, so today's market condition is showing a slight trend of activity, unlike the dull and stagnant situation of the past. The high price for 20-count Shuang Ma was 1,400 yuan, and the low price was 1,393.5 yuan. In the early afternoon, it initially traded at 1,402-3 yuan. Subsequently, morale improved, and the price gradually rose to 1,410 yuan. The final price was 1,409.5 yuan. Today, 37 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Penang, 62 pieces to Singapore, and 475 pieces to Hong Kong.

The morning opening for Shuang Ma was still unremarkable, due to the ongoing Balkan conflict and the activities of the short positions. The opening price was 1,396 yuan, and selling pressure was strong, with chaotic shouting. The price fell to 1,393.5 yuan. Subsequently, as foreign exchange stabilized and standard gold prices increased, the actual situation within the market halted, and buying became even more prevalent. The long positions also spread rumors that Shuang Ma would be shipped to Germany. For a time, buying was enthusiastic, and the price recovered to 1,398.5 yuan. However, as procurement from Hong Kong channels was weak, the situation softened again. By the time of closing, it was heard that the selling price of miscellaneous brand yarn was very high, and the short positions covered, causing the price to rise to 1,400 yuan at the close. A review of the transaction statistics for the half-day showed 3,740 bales. The amount purchased by each group is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 270 Peer 2,400

Amoy 20 Statistics 3,740

Inland 50

### Fine Lint Has Only Rises, No Falls

The current cotton situation remains good, but the price of Indian cotton is falling significantly, and American cotton is also continuing to decline. However, people's sentiments have not been severely affected. This is because of concerns that the Balkan conflict will spread, potentially creating problems with future sources. Therefore, although factory demand is not very strong, the industry has a unified expectation for higher prices. The cost of fine yarn raw materials is resulting in a situation of only rises and no falls. Yesterday, a total of 1,339 pieces were transacted, plus 400 bales at a flat price. Attached is the current cotton market price as follows:

Brazilian Cotton 370 Anjian 200 pieces

Middling 373.75 Peer 200 pieces

Also 378 Also 100 pieces

Pengjiabao 2.4 Also 100 pieces

Also 296 Also 100 pieces

Fine Lint Bales 270 Also 239 pieces

Fire Machine Straw Bales 204 Also 400 pieces

Rangoon Cotton 208.25 Also 200 pieces

Also 208.75 Also 100 pieces

Brazilian Cotton 370 Also 100 pieces

Another piece of news is the enthusiasm, as the industry is very keen on mutual transactions, and factories also require goods. In recent days, the transactions, excluding Indian cotton and Brazilian cotton, have focused on fine yarn raw materials. Both factories and industry peers are actively competing for purchases. As a result, the cotton market has entered a good state, with both activity and firm prices. Yesterday, the market price of Brazilian cotton reached a high of over 370 yuan, it is said.

New York's cotton market initially fell in the morning due to sales by foreign merchants and the impact of the Balkan conflict. However, it later rebounded slightly due to some short positions covering. As a result, the closing price was lower by 6 to 10 points compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market fell due to a large number of long positions closing and sellers repeatedly selling. Yesterday's closing price fell by approximately 80 to 90 rupees.

### Piece Goods Cantonese Sales Increase Dramatically, Selling Prices Rise

Factory Cloth Yesterday, the market initially remained flat before rising, due to the recent dramatic increase in spot sales in Guangdong and Hong Kong. The future order amounts for various factories have already been half booked, arousing hoarding sentiment within and outside the industry. Selling prices have both trended upwards. As a result, white goods, fine cloth, and twill rose by 2.5 jiao, coarse cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao, colored cloth rose by 5 jiao, and Gold Pagoda bleached cloth rose by 5 jiao. The remaining brands remained flat. The total transactions in this street were over 600 pieces of various cloths. The Guangdong-Chaozhou group bought over 400 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, flannelette, etc. The Zhejiang-Fujian group bought over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and colored cloth, etc.

Eastern Cloth The morning market was flat, and the afternoon market continued to rise, due to active actual sales and high factory prices. In the afternoon, the Longtou fine cloth's Xinzhan order rose to 50.085 yuan, and the Sijunzi serge jumped to 1.535 yuan.

Exports Today, 950 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong, 95 pieces to Singapore, and 4 pieces to Penang.

### Securities Class C Lottery Tomorrow

The unofficial market for public bonds weakened yesterday due to the continued outflow of cash bonds. Yuxing's maturing goods had not yet been cleared out. Tongkang's appetite for them was growing stronger, and Shunchang's buying had not waned. It was rumored that they were collecting goods on behalf of a certain overseas Chinese, almost daily. On one hand, spot goods were continuously flowing out, and on the other hand, a strong force continued to collect goods. The market price was therefore unstable. Judging by the trend, the selling side still had the upper hand for the time being. However, most people in the market were long positions, so although they tried to raise prices, they ultimately failed to reverse the downward trend. It was estimated that the market would only develop slightly after the two types of lotteries. It has now been determined that the lottery will be held on the 10th of this month. Today's market price will be calculated after removing the lottery rights in the afternoon. Yesterday's trading was still not prosperous. In the morning, Lianyi, Lianhe, Shunchang, Hefeng, Yizhong, and Xinhua bought in, while Yuxing sold out a lot of Class A and E bonds. Renfeng, Hongda, and Yitai also continued to sell out. The noon close was slightly weaker. In the afternoon, Tongkang bought in approximately 300,000 yuan, and Shunchang, Zhongyi, and Datong also bought in. However, Yuxing and Renfeng continued to sell out. Xie Kang sold out approximately 200,000 to 300,000 yuan of Class C bonds, and Jiufeng also sold out. The market price was raised several times, but it was ultimately suppressed. The long positions were unable to gain the upper hand for the time being. As a result, prices continued to decrease by 5 fen, 1 jiao to 3 jiao. Transactions amounted to approximately 1,670,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Change from Previous Day

Unified A 73.30 73.00 73.10 Down 0.10

Unified B 68.95 68.10 68.40 Down 0.24

Dutch red was 67.8 yuan to 68 yuan. Tai Gu granulated white B mark in Western warehouses was 88 yuan. HX mark in Eastern warehouses was 82 yuan. There was little difference. National sugar stocks were already scarce, and new arrivals were also lacking. Quotations have been silent for a long time, equivalent to zero.

### Miscellaneous Items Match Hoarders Resume Purchases

The price of matches falls and then rises, driven by people's fears of the Balkan conflict expanding, potentially disrupting raw material sources. Hoarders have resumed purchases, and those holding goods are being picky. Purchase prices are moving upwards again. Yesterday, the price of the "Beautiful" brand was 790 yuan, and the price of the "Phoenix" brand was 710 yuan per case, a rebound of 20 yuan compared to yesterday.

### Based on the Land Regulations, Municipal Councilors Should Be Elected According to Law, Chinese Strictly Observe Silence, Awaiting Development, Portuguese, Swiss, and Russian Nationals Eagerly Compete in the Election

The election of the Municipal Councilors, on which the public has focused its attention, has entered a critical stage. According to news from relevant parties yesterday, the negotiations among the consuls-general of the three countries will soon conclude. The British and American sides, regarding the change in the number of Municipal Councilors, are rumored not to abandon their consistent policy of "appeasement," even though it has been approved by the Chinese government. The legitimate status of the concession is showing signs of wavering. Although relevant officials from various countries were tight-lipped yesterday and refused to issue any comments, the public believes that the various countries will still violate the law and support candidates who have been put forward based on the "New Ratio" to be the next Municipal Councilors. However, the Chinese community in the city remains strictly silent, awaiting the future development of the situation. The details are recorded as follows:

Legal View Should Be Noted

According to Article 10 of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, the number of Western Councilors on the Municipal Council cannot exceed nine or be less than five. In other words, the legal number of Western Councilors is five to nine. Currently, there are nine Western Councilors: five British, two American, and two Japanese, which is indisputable. However, the "New Ratio" increases the number of Western Councilors from nine to twelve, which is clearly illegal, this being the first point. As for the Chinese Councilors, according to the same article, five members are nominated by the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, but now it has been reduced to four, which is also illegal, this being the second point. Furthermore, according to Article 18, if the Land Regulations need to be amended, changed, or added to, the final decision rests with the diplomatic representatives of various countries and the highest authorities of China. However, the negotiations among the consuls-general of the three countries have "resolved" to change the number of Councilors first, without submitting the proposal to the Chinese authorities for approval afterwards, which is legally inappropriate. Also, according to international law, any country must be recognized by various countries or a majority of countries before it can have a legal status in the international community. Now that various countries recognize Chongqing as the legitimate government of China, if the British and American authorities take contrary measures, it will not have legal effect.

There are Still Three Chinese Councilors in Shanghai

Regarding the issue of Chinese Councilors on the Municipal Council, because it concerns the interests of millions of Chinese in the concession, the nature is extremely serious. Currently, several Chinese Councilors have already left Shanghai, and the vacancies left behind, according to the explicit provisions of Article 20 of the Land Regulations, the Municipal Councilors can pass a resolution by majority to nominate candidates (such as when American Councilor Kana resigned and returned to his country, and the Board of Directors nominated Ming Side to succeed him). The existing Chinese Ratepayers' Association will never illegally nominate candidates. Therefore, if the Board of Directors does not appoint appropriate personnel to fill the vacancies of several Chinese Councilors, no party may nominate candidates without authorization, otherwise it would be illegal. Although the position of the Chinese Councilors is extremely difficult, for the sake of the happiness of millions of compatriots, they should strive to maintain their legal status. Yesterday, reporters learned from responsible parties that only Yu Qiaqing and Chen Tingrui have left Shanghai among the Chinese Councilors on the Municipal Council. The rumor that Guo Shun has left Shanghai is absolutely incorrect. The other two Councilors are Xi Yushu and Yuan Ludeng. Therefore, there are still three Chinese Councilors in Shanghai, which is one less than the so-called "New Ratio." However, all parties have high expectations for Guo, Xi, and Yuan.

German Candidate is Ge Letai

German merchant Yali Yanghang at 410 Sichuan Road sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating that they had read in your newspaper about the candidates for the British, American, German, and Japanese Councilors. The letter stated that the German Councilor position would be held by German national Gao Laide from this port. They requested that the aforementioned name be corrected to "Ge Letai," etc. After checking, the original name of Mr. Ge is Alfred Glathe, which is hereby published.

Portuguese and Swiss Nationals Prepare Candidates

The Portuguese community has high hopes of obtaining one of the neutral Councilors seats. However, the Portuguese community has not yet decided who to recommend to serve as the Portuguese Councilor. The Portuguese Consul-General in Shanghai, Melo, has contacted the Consuls-General of other countries and hopes to announce the name of the Portuguese Councilor candidate in the near future. The Swiss Consul-General in Shanghai, Fontana, replied to reporters, saying that there are very few Swiss nationals here who are likely to be nominated as candidates for the Municipal Councilors. The Swiss community will meet in the next few days to decide who to nominate.

White Russians Attempt to Obtain a Seat

The Municipal Council's plan to change the number of Councilors and add two neutral Councilors has aroused considerable excitement among the White Russians in the city. It is heard that the White Russians have drafted a plan to recommend one Russian Councilor, but they have not yet announced who they will nominate. Russian newspapers have all published articles about the British election of the Municipal Councilors, saying that there are 25,000 Russian nationals in Shanghai, who have more right to obtain a Councilor seat than other neutral nationals with fewer people. It is true that most of the White Russians live in the French Concession, but there are still thousands who reside or do business in the International Settlement. Russian newspapers claim that the White Russians also made a contribution to the establishment of the International Settlement. The White Russian team of the Municipal Council Police Force has served the Municipal Council and the International Settlement for the past fourteen years, with excellent results, it is said. It is heard that the White Russian Immigration Committee once met regarding the Municipal Council election, but no resolution was reached. However, according to well-informed sources, the Portuguese and Swiss nationals have the best chance of each occupying a neutral Councilor seat, while the White Russian's chance is extremely slim. It is heard that the White Russian Immigration Committee will hold a general meeting this Saturday to discuss this matter.

### Confirmed that China Communications Bank Detained Employees Have Regained Freedom, Five Senior Executives Left the Night Before

Regarding the restoration of freedom for the detained employees of the China Communications Banks, the details of the situation were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to news from the English-language Da Mei Evening Post, 150 employees of the China Communications Banks were suddenly arrested on the nights of the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of last month. After repeated mediation by the banking community in the city, all have been allowed to leave. According to inquiries yesterday (the 8th), five senior executives of the Bank of China have regained their freedom. It is also heard that the special committee organized by the China Communications Banks is now conducting negotiations to release all employees. Once the detailed terms have been agreed upon, all employees will be able to leave soon. Responsible people do not believe the rumors that the bail is based on cash. It is said that a total of 128 employees of the Bank of China were detained, including 9 section chiefs, 1 clerk and 1 auditor, and the rest were junior employees. The number of employees of the Bank of Communications who were detained is unknown. Last night, according to news from the Da Zhong News Agency, it was confirmed yesterday that the detained employees of the various banks had been released.

### Coal Merchants Who Raise Prices Try to Cover Up Their Crimes

According to reports from honest coal merchants, the price increase in the coal industry is a planned action. They are willing to release rumors of urging the retrieval of warehouse receipts, and factories are using transport costs as an excuse to cover up the crime of raising prices. After researching, since the plot of those rascals was revealed in the newspaper regarding a certain large coal briquette factory ordering 30,000 tons of cheap coal cinders from Mitsubishi Foreign Firm, the excuses of transport costs rising and other excuses are self-defeating. Even according to the statement of a certain employee of the Coal Industry Association, the industry has not ordered goods from abroad since transport costs rose. Based on the above facts from various aspects, the authorities should urgently impose sanctions and not ignore it.

### Labor Unrest in Various Industries; Labor and Management Nearing Agreement

Due to their unsuccessful demands for increased living allowances from the four shipping and automobile companies in Ningbo, all drivers and porters went on strike on the 6th of this month.

Their views are gradually converging, so the labor unrest is expected to be completely resolved in the short term.

Garment Industry Labor and Management Show Mutual Concessions

Following a strike by garment workers in this city for higher wages, a dispute arose over the issue of tailors paying for their meals at shop owners' homes, leading to an escalation of the labor unrest. According to a report from the Datong News Agency yesterday morning, the shop owners have agreed to concede one dime on the meal allowance, meaning each person would pay the shop owner nine dimes per day. The tailors are only willing to concede an additional five cents, making it eight dimes. As a result of the impasse, the garment shops remained closed yesterday, awaiting sincere consultations between the two parties.

Commercial Employees Strive for Pay Raises

The Commercial Press Employees' Association on Henan Road, feeling increasingly impoverished due to runaway inflation, convened a standing committee meeting on the 19th of last month. They resolved to send a letter to General Manager Wang in Hong Kong, requesting immediate and reasonable remedies for the employees' livelihoods. They sent a second letter on March 24, providing a detailed report on the general price increases in Shanghai and the living conditions of the workers. The association then commissioned Section Chief Shi of the Personnel Department to go to Hong Kong to personally plead with General Manager Wang, hoping the proposed measures would be implemented starting in April. Yesterday, they sent another urgent telegram urging a response, but the head office still provided no concrete reply. The association is now strongly advising its members to remain calm and await a reasonable resolution. Yesterday, they also published a notice to the employees.

### Flat and Weak Cigarette Coupon Market Difficult to Revitalize; Speculation Suffers Setbacks

The cigarette coupon market is very flat and weak. The sales of various daily necessities, such as soap, matches, candles, kerosene, and tobacco, are no longer as brisk as before. At the same time, as the sales of spot goods in the market have declined, the amount of capital in the market has increased, creating a situation of oversupply. Trading by industry peers has been relatively stable for the past two days. Speculators are at their wits' end. Their price-fixing rumors are no longer believed. Although they still attempt to reverse the decline, they are unable to rally public sentiment and feel uneasy and panicked. According to a person familiar with the cigarette coupon industry yesterday, after the prices of the above-mentioned daily necessities were driven up by speculators, people felt uneasy and rushed to buy spot goods in the market in an attempt to hoard them and wait for high prices before selling. At that time, there were few sellers of spot goods in the market. However, various manufacturers increased production in order to meet market demand. Therefore, spot goods in the market have gradually increased recently. At the same time, the general public is also buying in small quantities due to high prices, so actual consumption has become weak. Therefore, cigarette coupon shops have no intention of continuing to buy in the market. Many external speculators holding large quantities of spot goods feel extremely uneasy because all of their hoarded goods were purchased at high prices. Now that market prices are loosening, they will inevitably have to sell them at a low price. Moreover, their capital is limited and they cannot hoard them for long, so they are suffering losses. If they do not wake up, it is expected that they will suffer even more severe setbacks.

### Foreign Pigments Allowed to be Transported from Shanghai to Zhejiang

According to transportation industry sources, pigments from all countries are allowed to be imported from Shanghai into Zhejiang Province.

### Touring Free China – The Life of Hemingway – An Introduction to Contemporary American War Literature

— Yu Zhen

"For Whom the Bell Tolls," published last year, is his representative work. The content takes a four-day short love affair of a young couple as the weft and the Spanish fascist nationalist army and the Republican army civil war as the warp. The structure is similar to "A Farewell to Arms," except that the former takes the tail end of the pre-European war as the background. At that time, the author believed that war was nothing but meaningless slaughter, so the book describes the protagonists meeting by chance and eagerly seeking moments of pleasure. In the latter book, the author has admitted that war is not only not crazy, but also has great significance and importance, and people should disregard personal feelings for the sake of honor. He used to be disgusted with the hypocrisy of "heroism" and "patriotism" of the world, but now he no longer holds such views.

Therefore, the "For Whom the Bell Tolls," which sings loudly of "returning to the battlefield," expresses the innermost feelings of the people and is by no means comparable to vulgar love novels. On the other hand, this is a political novel. The author believes that the Spanish Civil War was the prelude to the current European War, implying that the defeat of any nation in the world will affect other nations. Bureaucratic politics, corrupt elements, and heresies, once victorious, will be the end of justice and fairness. Therefore, mankind must fight for their beliefs. This is glory, this is the tragedy of mankind, and it is also the crystallization of great art.

The sharpness of the writing and the depth of emotion in this book are comparable to those of the great British writer Kipling, and the current sales have reached 700,000 copies. Because its impression on readers is too profound, although the material is taken from a corner of Spain, what it describes is the touching truth of all mankind.

In short, Hemingway wrote this masterpiece, recognizing him as a genius war writer. He needs a just war to endow his art with supreme dignity.

Hemingway is a burly man, good at hunting and fishing. He is also a first-class reporter. Although he is unwilling to talk about grand theories, he will talk and laugh eloquently when he is in the mood. He has worked in Paris, Madrid, and dozens of cities in the United States. He has been married twice, has one son, and inspected the front lines of Guangdong and Guangxi with his wife last month. He has now arrived in Chongqing. (He flew from Guilin to Chongqing on the 6th of this month.)

A list of Hemingway's works: "Three Stories and Ten Poems" (1923), "In Our Time" (1924), "The Torrents of Spring" and "The Sun Also Rises" (1926), "Men Without Women" (1927), "A Farewell to Arms" (1929

### Arresting Kidnapping Bandits and Punishing Them Separately

### Cheng Xinchang Robbed; County Offers Reward for Capturing Robbers

They then moved seven cases of Shandong Huangchang silk, valued at over 35,000 yuan, out and loaded them onto a vehicle parked in front of Yuting Gate, disappearing without a trace. A reward of 5,000 yuan has now been offered for the arrest of the robbers involved in the case.

### Lei Binglin Invents Coarse Spinning Guide Yarn Machine

It is reported that after various yarn factories received orders from the concession authorities to save electricity in order to reduce consumption, most have considered issues such as reducing labor and saving money. Therefore, the output of each factory will inevitably be affected. Now, Mr. Lei Binglin, chief engineer of the First Factory of Wing On Textile Company, after years of research, has successively invented the "Fine Spinning Large Draft Machine Parts", "Coarse Spinning Guide Yarn Double-Hole Horn", and "U-Shaped Machine Parts". The former has been approved for patents by the former Ministry of Industry and the governments of Britain, the United States, France, India, and other countries. The coarse spinning guide yarn U-shaped machine parts have also been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and granted patents. The installation of this type of guide yarn machine parts can reduce the number of coarse spinning frames by half while still achieving the same output, and the costs of labor, electricity, materials, and repairs can also be reduced by half. This machine part has been adopted by the Xinsheng Yarn Factory at 748 Tokyo Road, Shanghai, and compared to the original 14,000 spindles, more than 10,000 spindles have been added. The increase in effectiveness is almost 80 percent, and the supply of coarse yarn is not only not lacking, but also more than sufficient. Those who want to know the details can visit or study at the factory to know that the statement is not false. Under the current extraordinary circumstances, if each yarn factory wants to maintain its original output and achieve twice the result with half the effort, adopting Lei's coarse spinning guide yarn machine parts will really help, and the cost of modifying the machine is very cheap, and the results can be seen immediately. The contact address is 843 Weihaiwei Road.

Study Lecture

### How to Prepare Daily Homework (Part One)

— Lu Shaoji

3.  Methods for Preparing Homework

Young students who want to achieve good results in preparing their daily homework should pay attention to the following points in addition to having the above-mentioned conditions:

(1) Time and Place Allocation Should Be Appropriate: Every young person should arrange a detailed timetable of daily work according to his own ability, such as when to go to the classroom for class, when to prepare homework in the room, when to have meals, when to get up, when to go to bed, and list them in the table one by one. Also, how much time is needed for previewing a certain subject, or when to switch to the next class, should also be roughly specified. In this way, it can avoid the difficulties of "not knowing where to start." It is equally important for young people to have a fixed place and a fixed time to prepare their homework. When doing homework, there must be a specific table and a specific chair, often used for reading and mental work. That place is the place to study. When the scheduled time arrives, go to that place and sit down, so that you can naturally feel at ease to do things.

(2) Prepare Immediately After Class: Prepare the homework instructed for a certain subject immediately after that subject's class. The reasons are: A. After a certain subject's class, there is still a tendency to learn that subject, so it is advisable to take advantage of the situation. B. Preview questions are still in your ears. C. After studying the subject twice, it is easier to remember.

(3) Pay Attention Immediately When Starting: When starting to prepare homework, first take a complete look at the assigned teaching materials, and also understand the work to be done, and insist on doing the thing in front of you as quickly as possible. In other words, when starting work, start immediately and work until it is finished.

(4) Be Focused When Preparing: When starting to prepare, you should use all your strength. Later, you must also concentrate your attention, have courage, have self-confidence, and not be tempted by your inner self or by the outside world. You must steadily proceed towards the goal and work diligently. At a minimum, you must be able to prepare one subject. If the goal is difficult to achieve at once, you must also complete it in stages. But one point to note is that after intense work, you must take a moment to rest, so that your mind is free, and then continue to do other work.

(5) Have the Intention to Remember When Preparing: Having the intention to remember is also an important condition when preparing homework. If you only read mechanically without the determination to remember, the effect will not be great. Therefore, when reading your own books, if you see something important, you may want to underline it with a pen to make it conspicuous. Also, when you encounter complex reading materials, you can make a large outline to facilitate memorization.

(6) Have Interest When Preparing: "Interest", "attention" and "memory" are all elements of effective learning. Therefore, when preparing homework, you must find motivation and make yourself interested in the homework. If you encounter a subject you don't like, you must supplement it with motivation or inducements. The teacher in charge of the subject should be responsible for arousing interest.

(7) Connect New and Old Lessons: When preparing new lessons, you should make a general review of the old lessons. The reasons are: A. The old spies are more familiar and not difficult to pay attention to, and it is easy to use them as a starting point for previewing new lessons. B. This kind of review can deepen the impression of the review material once, making it easier to remember later. C. This review material can show many points of contact with the new lesson. In other words, its function is to connect the new and old, and to provide a fundamental condition for learning.

(8) Avoid Reliance and Perfunctoriness: When preparing homework, you should get rid of the idea of working for the teacher. For more difficult subjects such as Chinese, English, and mathematics, you should spend more time and pay special attention. Do not seek help from others unless absolutely necessary. When answering questions, do not be discouraged if you encounter the first setback. You should have the determination to try again and again. Also, when preparing homework, you must recognize what you are doing, and do not be perfunctory. You must understand the teacher's intention in assigning the preview and the importance of the subject.

In short, the method for young students to prepare their daily homework is to actively arrange a weekly homework schedule, prepare immediately after class, and pay attention immediately when starting. Also, when preparing, you must be focused, have the intention to remember, have interest, and seek to connect with old lessons. As for the negative aspects, you must avoid perfunctoriness and avoid reliance. Daily homework should be prepared in this way. The same can be done when preparing for exams. And if daily homework can be prepared very well, then preparing for exams will be very easy.

Essays

### "Different Tunes, Same Skill"

— Jue Hui

The wonder of "different tunes, same skill" lies precisely in "same skill" and yet "different tunes."

This is a very good way to hide things: perhaps relying on one's own authority and power; perhaps relying on the magic of one's own money; perhaps relying on one's own "unimaginable" potential... And so, doing whatever one wants, saying whatever one wants, everything is possible!

But after all, "Heaven bestows a great responsibility on this person," one cannot "use outright force" nor can one "repeat the same old tricks"; thinking this way and that, calculating this way and that, and so the "different tunes" are created, and the "skill," of course, is "six of one, half a dozen of the other," not much different.

And people suddenly look at it, not only thinking it is "disobedient," but even want to "applaud and praise": "What a kind gentleman!" (It's best to "sing" it.)

For this reason, the clever ones are competing to play "different tunes"; only fools specialize in playing "old tunes."

The more "different tunes" are played, perhaps it will respond to the principle of "when things reach an extreme, they revert"; people become suspicious...

Therefore, the unfortunateness of different tunes but the same skill also lies precisely in "different tunes" and yet "same skill"!

### Third Aunt Buys Coal Briquettes

— Contemplation

A night of wind and rain chased "spring" without a trace, and, the next morning, it was still drizzling incessantly.

Third Aunt, with a wrapped vegetable basket under her arm and an umbrella in her hand, adjusting herself carefully, walked home from the vegetable market with her bound feet.

On the trucks, large bamboo baskets were piled high with coal dust, one basket after another, about thirty baskets, stacked high. The trucks passed her by. The large oilcloth covering the coal baskets, caught by the wind, fluttered like a flapper's braids, making "pa pa pa" sounds.

This caught Third Aunt's attention and stirred up her household affairs worries. She thought, "The price of coal briquettes is probably going to rise again, right? I should probably order a load in advance to be safe."

She muttered to herself, and trudged to the front of the coal store. She peered inside stealthily. "Heh!" she thought to herself, "How much money are all these goods worth!" Inside the coal store, coal briquettes, lumps of coal, and firewood were piled up, leaving only a narrow path to walk through. Third Aunt only knew they were valuable, but couldn't estimate how much they were worth.

She hesitantly asked the coal-black-faced shop assistant:

"What's the price of coal briquettes?"

"Thirteen yuan."

"Thirteen yuan?" Third Aunt's heart skipped a beat. "Wasn't it only twelve yuan the day before yesterday?"

"It went up today."

"Oh! Oh..." Third Aunt calmed down, thinking to herself, "There's still enough for a few more days at home, I'll wait and see, maybe it will drop. Sigh, these days..."

Thus, one day passed in vain.

On the morning of the third day, Third Aunt passed by the coal store with her vegetable basket, worriedly going forward to test her "fate."

But...

"Sixteen yuan!"

"Ah!" Third Aunt was stunned. "How did it go up so much!"

The shop assistant glared at Third Aunt disdainfully, saying:

"Up, heh! Soon there won't be any to burn, if foreign countries start a war, the supply route will be cut off immediately."

"Then, then it hasn't been cut off yet!" Third Aunt anxiously argued with the shop assistant.

"You woman are really," the shop assistant's eyebrows suddenly tightened as if someone had punched him, "Don't you know the coal briquette factory is on strike? If the workers do all the work, what's left for the boss to earn!"

"Then, then what did they earn before?..."

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(6) Product of Love

"How could there be none! When my mother died the year before last, I personally sent her coffin back to my hometown, which is in Dongxiang, Cangzhou. Open your eyes and look around, it's almost all green." Mentioning his hometown, Begonia's spirits immediately increased a lot.

"The vegetables grown in the fields, freshly picked and cooked, are much tastier than big fish and meat!"

Xiangqi immediately stood up from the bed, obviously also very excited.

"Although Cangzhou is a bit closer, since it's the countryside, it's unlikely that they'll be able to find it. But did Yuan Shaowen go there with you the year before last?"

"No, because I have no home there at all."

"Then who else is there?"

"There's a paternal uncle and several cousins, all farmers, very honest." Begonia constantly stroked his hands, feeling that these hands were indeed kept very tender, and their fineness was no less than that of ordinary women. But when it came to practicality, how could they compare to the rough hands of his uncle, cousins, and cousins, which were worse than bamboo? "Living with them wouldn't be as interesting as it is now, but countrymen are inevitably more timid. If they knew about our affairs, they would definitely not dare to take us in."

Xiangqi took a few more steps forward, the corner of her clothes already touching the square table on Begonia's right.

"That's not what I meant at all," she bent her four fingers and tapped the table lightly three or five times. "A person wants to come up with an idea to teach others to take him in, that's not very interesting at all! Who can rely on who in this world? So we might as well not do this thing, but if we do it, we have to rely on ourselves..."

Begonia's lips barely moved, wanting to interject, but Xiangqi had already continued vigorously.

"You can first send some of the money you've saved back, and ask your uncle to buy a few acres of farmland nearby, and build a few small houses. Just say that every summer, you plan to go to the countryside to rest for a month or two, so they won't suspect anything else. At the same time, you can also take this opportunity to give your uncle some more money to make him happy, and it's always good to have more care in the same village in the future."

### Not Taking a Penny

— Shu Ying

Depending on leadership for food, depending on strength for food, depending on brains for food... it seems there is nothing more labor-saving, more profitable, and that comes with more "refreshing decisiveness" than "taking advantage of a fire to rob."

Understanding this point, then one wants to skim before, one wants to skim after, and one wants to skim from above and below. And the oath that always hangs on the corner of the mouth, "If there is any corruption, may Heaven punish and the Earth destroy," can definitely be used first, can definitely be used second, can definitely be used third; and it can be used forever.

Mencius said: "Not to give a penny to others, not to take a penny from others." Of course, regardless of whether old Master Mencius is "in line with the trend" now, I think these two sentences can be examined with a magnifying glass!

If, in the unlikely event that the examination reveals disagreement, then there is no need for the curse of "Heaven punish and the Earth destroy"! I would truly have to face the consequences, wouldn't that be terrible?

I say: As long as you have a "conscience," that's enough...

### Pen Flowers

— You Zuoxun

Willing to do "bitter" work, then there is no "bitter" situation; able to learn "good" examples, then one is a "good" person.

Evil friends should not be associated with, because the difficulty of "breaking off relations" with them is like a new brush stained with ink, which cannot be washed clean by any means.

Knowing one's mistakes and correcting them is indeed a virtue, but it is still like a nail on the wall, even if it is removed, its trace will remain forever.

The future is indeed vast and dark, but do not be afraid, for those who are fearless, there is always a bright and smooth road ahead. I got a lot!"

The workers ignored Granny Sanhao and left, shouting "Khan, Khan."

"Ah!" Granny Sanhao complained to herself, "Why did I ask him all these irrelevant things? How could my father figure out this kind of thing? My heavens, should I buy a load or not?"

Granny Sanhao thought of her child, thirty years old, uh, thirty years old, but looking as old as thirty-six or thirty-seven, especially in the last three years, alas, always coughing. Granny Sanhao advised him to buy some cheap tonics to eat, but, alas, but a hundred or so old dollars had to support a mother, support a wife, and support a baby just over one year old. It was already lucky not to be in debt, where would there be money...

"Why think about these things again?" Her nose was sour and watery, and Granny Sanhao almost shed old tears, "Should I buy a load or not? ...Ah, ...buy a load, alas! I'll use the money Ashun gave me to buy a water chestnut pillow first, I won't see it anyway when I'm dead!"

Granny Sanhao trembled and pleaded with the clerk: "Boss, send a load, make sure the weight is enough!"

"Sixteen dollars!"

"Yes, I know, six-teen—dol-lars! Alas, make sure the weight is enough!"

Granny Sanhao, with tears in her eyes, struggled to twist her small feet and walked towards her home, praying in her heart: "I can only ask the ancestors to bless me, so that Ashun can get a raise soon..."

A truck sped past her, coal dust, piled high in baskets, drilling into Granny Sanhao's eyes.

### Without a Title

— Juan Juan

A son getting married is just a father becoming an old grandpa, what's so strange about that? I am "just turning thirty," and it has nothing to do with twenty-nine or twenty-one, but I want to place an advertisement to announce it to relatives and friends. There is no other reason, everyone "knows what's going on."

Therefore, "old and sick, recuperating in another place," or "shutting the door to decline visitors, not asking about worldly affairs," all have profound meanings.

But things are valued for their rarity, and fabrics from 1941 are the most popular. Everyone copying old articles will inevitably lack interest and lose its "purpose," or even be "slapping oneself in the face"—for example, the account of "eating white rice" is "slapping oneself left and right" in the advertisement.

After the "white" ones suffered losses, the "black" ones naturally became smarter: first, they respectfully inform the holders of warehouse receipts to take delivery of goods immediately, as if "serving society and sparing no effort," and if there is any disturbance, only those holding warehouse receipts will be questioned! But this is the prelude; when the embroidered curtain is drawn open, the formal program begins, and this program is called "temporary increase in price"!

In addition to "sincerely expressing our sincerity," a new record of sixteen yuan per unit was created!

### Talking About Several Monkeys in Shanghai

— Xiao

In the North, those who are famous for performing monkey operas, after Zhang Honglin, were Yang Xiaolou, and among the Kunqu opera troupes, Hao Zhenji. Among the younger generation, Ye Shengzhang, Li Wanchun, Li Shaochun, Li Shengbin, Li Shengzuo, Liu Fengkui, Liang Huichao, and Zhang Yunxi, all excel in monkey operas, but their art and skill are not as good as Yang Xiaolou and Hao Zhenji. Xiaolou's monkey opera rarely has the air of a monkey, and Lao Hao's Monkey King is too much like an ape. Yang Ling said, "Although Wukong is also a monkey, he must break free from the form. It's okay to occasionally have the appearance of a monkey, but always acting like an ape will turn him into a little ape, not like Sun Wukong." Therefore, Yang Xiaolou's monkey opera doesn't have the ape-like tone, but his fame is very big because his face, figure, and limbs are already monkey-like enough. Hao Zhenji, apart from his facial movements, hand movements, and foot placements being exactly like a monkey, has no other special talents. Experts consider him inferior to Xiaolou.

Southern monkey operas have never been highly valued. Although Saihuohou (Zheng Changtai) was good at performing monkey operas, he was not very famous. His son, Xiaohuohou (Zheng Faxiang), is also a master in the field. This person is extremely moral. In his early years, he was highly valued by Huang Jinrong, who specially built a theater, named Qitian Stage (now the Gong Stage), and invited him to star in "Journey to the West," which caused a sensation at the time. In the last ten years, he has been quite frustrated. He once performed in a small theater, but he cherishes monkey opera very much. Before joining a stage, he insisted on not performing monkey operas as a prerequisite, and the order of the plays could be changed freely (except for "Sizhou City"). Recently, he was affiliated with the Da Xin Company's Beijing troupe and starred in "Journey to the West." It is a pity that a hero has not been recognized. He has an apprentice named Xiaoxiaohuohou, who is the grandson of Niu Songshan and the son of Niu Xiaoshan. Yang Xiaolou and Li Wanchun's "Night Flight" was passed down by the Niu family. The Niu family's martial arts roles are very famous, so Xiaoxiaohuohou's "Eight Great Hammers" is very outstanding. Martial clown operas and Guan operas are all family traditions. His monkey opera was corrected by Zheng Faxiang. In recent years, he has traveled to Gan and Yu and has a little reputation. He entered the Xianshi Amusement Park in the new year, and soon went to Tianjin. Recently, he returned from Tianjin to accept the assignment of the New World authorities and served as the pillar of the Da Jing troupe.

Gai Jiaotian once starred in "Journey to the West" at the Gong Stage. His monkey opera is different from others, focusing on real skills, such as playing the pipa on a camel's back, playing the pipa with one hand and wielding a whip with the other, and one foot can still dance with a ring. Wang Guiqing learned from him. Guiqing apprenticed to Gai Jiaotian and performed "Journey to the West" at the Great World. After Zhang Yipeng, he joined the Great Stage to fill Yipeng's vacancy and continued to perform "Journey to the West." His art is also very good. Zhang Yipeng is Gai Jiaotian's eldest son. He became famous for singing "Journey to the West" and relied on this one play at the Great Stage for four or five years. Yipeng's monkey focuses on the small movements of the monkey: scratching his head, moving his eyebrows, shrugging his shoulders, retracting his legs, and his demeanor when entering and exiting the stage. He is truly an ape.

Guo Kunquan comes from a family of actors. His grandfather, Guo Xiuhua, and his father, Guo Diexian, were both famous actors in their time. His childhood stage name was Guo Zhangyang. He has a solid foundation in short and long fighting roles. The two plays "Cutting Zidu" and "Jiepai Pass" can dominate the North and South. It is a pity that he has fallen into the amusement park because of his short stature and hoarse voice. I once watched his monkey opera "Golden Knife Formation," which is based on Zheng Faxiang's style. His hands, eyes, ears, techniques, and steps are all good. The most commendable thing is that he can flip down from a table with the chair and sit upright at the edge of the stage, with accurate footing and a beautiful posture. I have never seen a second person do it.

In addition, Zhang Yunlou, Gao Xueqiao, Li Zhonglin, Jia Binhou, and Yuan Xiaolou have all performed "Journey to the West." Zhang Yunlou was at the Old Gengxin; Gao Xueqiao replaced Gai Jiaotian at the Gong Stage; Li Zhonglin performed "Journey to the West" at the New World, and his name was still Xiaoxiaoguiyu. At that time, he could still sing old male roles. I also heard him sing "Feast of the Courtiers" at the Du Ancestral Hall fair.

### Zhang Yipeng's Sun Wukong

### Drama News

— Juexin

Because Kunqu opera singer Han Suqiu is sick and on leave, and Chen Hefeng and Yun Yanxia are also leaving the Tianchan Stage, the authorities feel a lack of female leads. To remedy this, they plan to borrow the Kunqu opera actress Mao Jianqiu from Xun Huisheng's troupe during their performance period at the Gengxin Stage, and then return her to Gengxin when Zhang Yipeng performs the two-part "New Journey to the West" again. The two sides have already had a round of consultations. If Jianqiu herself does not object, there may be no problem.

Martial arts actor Liang Huichao has accepted the Gengxin Stage's invitation to go south and departed on the Xin Beijing ship on the sixth. He is scheduled to arrive today. Gengxin has assigned staff members to welcome him at the Taikoo Wharf. After joining Gou Huisheng's troupe, Huichao will join the performance of the two-part "Journey to the West."

### The View of Life Through Struggle

— Zongyu

Optimism in struggle is not blind faith in divine power, not belief in natural changes, not arrogance, and even less deliberate pretense, but rather finding a true foothold for optimism. This kind of foothold can indeed be a weapon for struggle.

### Blood and Two Beautiful Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter Five: Red Skirt Hates the Pomegranate Flower

Seeing that the two horses were facing each other, separated by just over ten paces, Red Maiden suddenly took out something from her waist, twisted her willow waist, and threw it at Li Xin's head. It was the red brocade lasso she was good at using. Li Xin was not prepared for this move and could not dodge in time. The lasso fell straight down and landed right on his body. As soon as he said, "Not good!" Red Maiden quickly tightened the lasso in her hand and bound Li Xin, then pulled him hard into her arms, saying, "Come here!" Li Xin fell off his horse, and several bandits immediately rushed forward and captured him. Li Xin's retainers stepped forward to save him, but were stopped by Red Maiden. The magistrate of Qi County and Xu Jing saw Li Xin's loss and shouted in unison. Xu Jing wanted to leave the city to rescue him, but the magistrate of Qi County feared that the bandits would take advantage of the situation to attack the city and refused to let him go. Just when they were at a loss, they suddenly saw Red Maiden leading her troops to retreat completely, and the siege of Qi County was lifted. This made the magistrate of Qi County and Xu Jing and others confused, unable to guess the bandits' intentions. Li Xin was captured by the bandits and did not expect to return alive, allowing the bandits to mistreat him. Red Maiden gathered her troops and returned to Qingfeng Mountain, instructing two bandits to treat Li Xin well and send him to the upper room. She then went inside to rest. Li Xin was escorted by the two men to a beautiful guest room. The two men untied the ropes on his body, restoring his freedom, and then retreated outside. Before long, they brought up exquisite dishes and wine and food, filling a table. Li Xin felt very hungry at this time, so he sat down at the table without ceremony and had a big meal. After eating, the bandits took away the leftovers and brought a bathtub and two buckets of bathwater, inviting Li Xin to take a bath. Li Xin felt uncomfortable, and since someone was serving him to bathe, he readily agreed. After bathing, someone brought a new set of clothes for him to change into. After he was seated, someone brought fragrant tea and lit a censer. Li Xin found it strange that the bandits treated him so well. Weren't the bandits here to attack the county? Why did they take me as a prisoner and retreat with their troops? They captured me alive and did not kill me, but treated me so well. What were they thinking? Now I am trapped in a bandit's den, and I don't know how it will end. As he sat alone in doubt, he suddenly heard footsteps approaching and a great man walked in. Looking closely, it was none other than Tong Tianbao, Red Maiden's elder brother.

### A Record of the Shanghai Harmonica Concert

— Zhudong

The Shanghai Harmonica Society's third anniversary concert at the Carlton Theatre the day before yesterday morning was quite successful. The five ensemble pieces, two quintets, and three solo pieces were all of a fairly average standard. Comparatively speaking, the ensemble "Going to War" and the solo "Heaven and Hell" were the most popular, proving that the majority of the audience still prefers works with an upward meaning.

There were two musicians, one movie star, and one choir who provided assistance. Professor Mei Ye's violin solo and blind musician Wu Shaorong's piano solo both demonstrated a high level of technical skill. Bai Hong's solo was very popular, and it was also quite interesting to have the harmonica band accompany her.

The Experimental Music Society's choir showed even more progress. Although it was only a small group, they sang very movingly. "Cuckoo" is already a work we are used to hearing. Who wouldn't feel a kind of warmth when they hear the cry of "Coo-coo-coo-coo—the suffering is coming to an end, spring is near"?

Due to the success of this concert, it is said that the Shanghai Harmonica Society has an "ambitious plan" to hold another concert soon.

If realized, I hope there will be improvements to the stage setup.

### America's "New Respect" for Greece

— Wang Xuan

Greece rose up to resist Italy and won repeatedly, so the world cannot help but look at it differently. The United States expressed great sympathy for Greece's resistance. The American film industry authorities also notified all film companies that all films mentioning Greeks must be treated with new respect. All companies have been ordered to implement this. For example, in the Republic Pictures' new film "Sis Hopkins," there is a Greek who runs a vaudeville theater named Kopopolis, which has been revised. According to the company's announcement, the revised Kopopolis is still a vaudeville theater operator, but the role has been written as a more respectable character. In another Republic film, "Rookies on Parade," there is a Greek gambler named Nick, who wins all the money when people gamble with him. After the authorities notified them to respect Greeks, the role was rewritten. The gambler is still a gambler, but he has been changed to gamble with soldiers in the film and loses every time.
