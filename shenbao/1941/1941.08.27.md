### If the Anglo-American Declaration Is Not Realized, China Vows to Fight to the End; Vice President Kung Is Confident That America Will Uphold Justice; US-Japan Negotiations Will Be Based on the Nine-Power Treaty

Chongqing, 20th (United Press) - Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Dr. H.H. Kung, yesterday approved of Churchill's remarks, saying that China is not worried about hearing of US-Japan negotiations. Kung stated, "I have welcomed the Eight Principles procedure proposed by Mr. Churchill, and I am now pleased to hear Mr. Churchill's message. From China's standpoint, I dare to believe that any US-Japan negotiations will be based on the Nine-Power Treaty and the Eight Principles procedure. Therefore, China does not need to be apprehensive about the outcome of the negotiations." He also said that he dared to believe that "friendly countries will never betray China. I believe they will uphold justice and take into account the national rights of all countries in the world." Kung explained that the formulation of the Nine-Power Treaty was not only for the benefit of China and the Pacific, but also took into account the entire world. The principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration are based on world peace and order. Kung declared, "I deeply know that President Roosevelt will understand that if such principles are ignored and despised, it will cause danger and chaos, and will inevitably lead to war. I know that President Roosevelt will insist that Japan recognize these principles as the basis for reaching any solution." Kung expressed his belief that if Japan does not comply, there is no possibility of a peaceful resolution. Kung also said, "We have adhered to these principles and will fight to the end for these principles. We have been fighting for four years, and if necessary, we will fight for another four years or forty years to realize these principles." Kung also said that he felt that the eight principles of Roosevelt and Churchill had given a good omen for the future of the world, and Churchill's speech further clarified the situation and showed that Britain would fully cooperate with the United States to the end.

Washington, 25th - When Secretary of State Hull met with reporters today, someone asked what the British Prime Minister meant by saying that the United States was making every effort to reach an agreement with Japan. Hull acknowledged that he had engaged in some informal talks with Japanese Ambassador Nomura, but no agreement had been reached. The Secretary of State insisted that any solution to Far Eastern problems must be based on the ten points he himself announced in July 1937. According to well-informed sources, there is no doubt that the US and Japan are conducting talks in Washington. However, Hull has made it clear to Nomura that if Japan continues its aggression, the United States will not compromise with Japan and will further exert economic pressure on Japan. Hull refused to announce whether Japan had proposed an outline for resolving US-Japan issues, or whether US Ambassador to Japan Grew had received proposals from the Japanese side. Various parties have also speculated whether the United States is willing to maintain the status quo with Japan, allowing Japan to temporarily occupy Vietnam and discuss the entire Far East issue after the war, or whether the United States will break with Japan. Churchill's assurance that he would do his best to help the United States in the event of a US-Japan war is the first time in British history that such a thorough guarantee of obligation has been made to the United States regarding its Far East policy. Qualified observers generally believe that Japanese moderates are still unable to change the Japanese government's aggressive policies, and Japanese warmongers are still unwilling to give up their southward advance.

Washington, 26th (International News Service) - Secretary of State Hull warned Japan today against further aggression, declaring that the United States could not compromise on Pacific issues until Japan ceased its armed conquest. Hull said that the eight points announced by the United States at the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War remain the goals of the United States. He then listed the details of the eight principles calling for the adoption of negotiation methods and the prohibition of the use of force. Hull stressed that the United States insists that its Far Eastern rights must be preserved, and said that the US and Japan are currently conducting informal negotiations. However, Washington officials pointed out that, according to the articles of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Open Door Policy, if the relevant powers also participate in the negotiations, the current disputes between the US and Japan can be resolved peacefully.

Washington, 20th (International News Service) - Secretary of State Hull spoke with Japanese Ambassador Nomura on Saturday. It was revealed that the US and Japan still adhere to their respective policies. Therefore, the State Department believes that the Far Eastern situation is extremely fragile. It is said that Nomura requested the United States to stop aiding Chongqing in exchange for Japan's willingness to quickly resolve all issues concerning the Far East with the United States. Hull pointed out to Nomura that if Japan remains a member of the Axis powers and insists on its "New Order Policy" aimed at dominating the Western Pacific by force, then the United States will find it difficult to make any concessions to Japan, and it will also be impossible. However, it is reported that Hull also told Nomura that if Japan adopts a friendly attitude and is willing to achieve its goals through peaceful means, then the United States is fully willing to negotiate all Far Eastern issues with Japan.

Jenson Says US Determined Policy to Fully Aid China As It Aids Britain

Honolulu, 26th (United Press) - US Minister to Australia, Jenson, and his wife, eight-year-old son Nelson, and six-year-old daughter Patty, arrived here yesterday aboard the American ship "Mariposa" en route to Australia to take up their posts. Jenson told reporters that there have been no changes in the United States' Far East policy. He also said, "The United States has formulated a policy of aiding China as it aids Britain. Since the outbreak of the war, Japan has been the focus of the world's attention. The country is still in its former position."

Britain and the United States No Longer Appease Japan, but the Door to Peace Is Still Open

Manila, 26th (Reuters) - The Manila "Tribune" commented on British Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast, saying that democratic countries have opened the door of honor to peace, but the path of appeasement has indeed been completely closed. Churchill's words almost reaffirmed this meaning. Churchill declared that democratic countries are engaged in a war to destroy Nazism, and Churchill regards Japan, which seeks to create a new order, as the main follower of Nazism in the Far East. Churchill's words indicate that the strength of resistance to aggressors is increasing and will continue to expand. Although it is still dark at present, the light will be seen in the near future. The newspaper also detailed the Iranian incident, saying that Britain and the Soviet Union have benefited from the teachings of Iraq and the Balkans, and have now preemptively acted to prevent the Axis powers from occupying important oil areas and the gateway to India.

Tefft Couber Warns Japan That Reckless Actions Will Inevitably Lead to Misfortune

San Francisco, 26th (International) - Former British Minister of Information Tefft Couber dismissed his position as the British government's Far East liaison officer, comparing it to that of the Governor of India, saying, "I must ensure that I will be able to fully cooperate and will have good efficiency, and will never interfere with the rights of the Far Eastern governments." The newly appointed Far East liaison officer and his wife, Diana G., left San Francisco today by fast plane for Singapore.

San Francisco, 26th (United Press) - Tefft Couber warned Japan yesterday, saying, "Now is not the time to engage in imperialist adventures in the Far East." He said, "I can assert that it is too late for Japan to take any action now. A year ago, when we withdrew from Dunkirk, we were running out of ammunition and food. Japan should have acted at this time. Whatever action Japan wants to take, it should have gone all out at that time."

Chongqing, 26th (United Press) - Second Secretary of the British Embassy, Yalin, and his wife left Chongqing by plane yesterday for Singapore to serve as assistants to Tefft Couber, the former British Minister of Information who now holds an important position in the Far East.

Singapore, 26th (Reuters) - Yesterday, more Indian troops arrived here to increase the strength of the Malayan defense forces. Among them were infantry, artillery, and engineering teams, who disembarked in various places, all fully equipped. A large number of air force officers and soldiers came from England, the largest number in a year.

Japanese Government Spokesman Reveals US-Japan Negotiations Cover a Wide Range

Tokyo, 26th (Reuters) - Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told foreign reporters today that we are in the position of the government and do not want to comment on the broadcast speech made by British Prime Minister Churchill, but the comments of various newspapers are enough to reflect Japanese public opinion. When asked whether the Japanese government welcomes the negotiations with Japan to reach a fair and peaceful solution to the Far East issue mentioned in Churchill's speech, Ishii replied that if the five people can obtain a reasonable conclusion, they will naturally be welcome. When asked whether the overall situation has developed to the point where such negotiations can be held, Ishii replied that this must be determined by the situation. At that time, many people asked questions about the US-Japan negotiations. Ishii also replied that he was sorry that he did not know. When asked whether Waksugi, the diplomatic advisor to Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura, brought back concrete suggestions when he returned to China, Ishii replied no, but admitted that the member would return to China in the near future. He also said that although several reports have been sent to the government regarding Nomura's meetings with US authorities, he did not know the progress of the talks in Washington. What Nomura and the US authorities are discussing should be matters of common concern to Japan and the United States, but Nomura has a wide range of discretion, he said.

Tokyo, 26th (Reuters) - "Kokumin Shimbun" stated that British Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast was aimed at alienating Thailand from Japan. Churchill was also anachronistic, because the Sino-Japanese conflict occurred before the European war, so Japan is not imitating Hitler. China's construction is cooperative, Vietnam's advance is voluntary, and the only one putting pressure on Southeast Asia is Britain. Officials said they had not heard anything about the US-Japan basic negotiations implied by Churchill. They have not recently received reports from Ambassador Nomura to the United States.

### US Entry Into War Not Far Off, Prediction of US Senators

San Francisco, 26th (International News Service) - Senator Johnson predicted today that the US will enter the war within two months, "or will launch on several fronts simultaneously."

Washington, 26th (United Press) - Ohio Republican Senator Taft said yesterday that British Prime Minister Churchill's speech on Sunday indicated that British leaders believed that President Roosevelt had "guaranteed that the United States would enter the war." Taft also said, "Churchill's words are intended to instigate the American people to help Britain fight."

### US Gasoline Transport to Soviet Union Issue, US and Japan Conducting Negotiations, If British and Soviet War in Iran Succeeded, US Can Open Up Safe Supply Line

Tokyo, 26th (Reuters) - Information Bureau spokesman Ishii admitted today while receiving reporters that Japan and the United States are negotiating the issue of the United States transporting oil to the Soviet Union, but said that Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Takekawa has not held talks with Soviet authorities. When asked about reports that US oil tankers will be escorted to Vladivostok with convoys, Ishii replied that he was not aware of this matter. When asked about the freezing of American funds, Ishii replied that the Japanese government strictly adheres to the principle of reciprocity. He also said that he believed that the Dutch East Indies freezing regulations were not harsh. As for the issue of restoring trade with the Dutch East Indies, it is currently under discussion and much progress has been made. When asked whether Article 9 of the 1905 Portsmouth Treaty stipulates that the Soya and Tartary Straits will not be fortified and will be open to free navigation, Ishii replied that this article must be interpreted in light of the changed international situation.

Washington, 26th (United Press) - Qualified sources here declared yesterday that if the British and Soviet war in Iran succeeds, the United States will likely use the guns of the Pacific Fleet to protect the transportation of military supplies to Britain and the Soviet Union. After the British and Soviet forces meet in Iran, the final link of the Pacific supply line of military importance can be completed. The line starts from the west coast of the United States, passes through British Malaya to India and the Persian Gulf, and then crosses Iran or the Caspian Sea to the southeastern part of the Soviet Union. The United States Pacific Fleet can guarantee the safety of the transportation route without leaving the Pacific. Therefore, it has broken the Axis's hope of forcing the American fleet into the Pacific, so that Japan can freely engage in its extension program in the South Pacific. The route will be safe outside the war zone and will shorten the current route through the Red Sea and Egypt to the Middle East.

### US President Sets September 1st for Broadcast Speech

Washington, 26th (Reuters) - President Roosevelt's broadcast on Monday, September 1st, will be one of the highlights of the sixty-minute Labor Day broadcast program prepared by the Production Management Office.

At that time, both the National and Columbia Broadcasting Companies will broadcast across the United States. In addition, those participating in the broadcast include Green of the American Federation of Labor and Hillman, Assistant Director of the Production Management Office.

### Germany Shows Impatience, Calls on Japan to Unite

Tokyo, 26th (United Press) - The Director of the Information Office of the German Embassy, ​​Gerduen, told the Japanese press today, "Churchill's speech is a curse against our Axis camp representing justice." He accused the purpose of Churchill's speech of being to divide the Axis camp in a cunning way. The British conspiracy is to divide and then rule, so we Axis members should be extremely careful, he said.

### New Zealand Prime Minister Visits Roosevelt to Review the Far East Situation

Pa ​​Dimo, 26th (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser told visiting reporters yesterday that the Far East situation will be the main topic of discussion in his talks with President Roosevelt. Although the situation there is serious, it is not irreversible. British Prime Minister Churchill has already spoken on behalf of all of us to warn Japan yesterday.

### Thailand Newly Appoints Acting Prime Minister

Bangkok, 26th (United Press) - Thai Prime Minister General Songgram yesterday appointed Police Chief and Interior Minister Churas to act as his acting Prime Minister and other positions on his behalf. The Prime Minister explained this matter, saying that when he is unable to handle official affairs, he will act on his behalf to carry out national affairs, so as to avoid dereliction of duty.

### Dutch East Indies Expels Two Japanese Reporters

Batavia, 26th (Reuters) - According to Japanese sources, two Japanese reporters representing "Nichinichi Shimbun" and "Mainichi Shimbun" have been ordered to leave the country by the Dutch East Indies government and have now returned to Japan. The Dutch East Indies government refused to issue them residence permits because it was dissatisfied with the editorials of the two newspapers. According to today's statement, there are currently five Japanese reporters in the Dutch East Indies, including three from Domei, one from "Asahi Shimbun", and one from "Yomiuri Shimbun".

### Soviet Official Denies Sino-Soviet Conference

Moscow, 26th (TASS) - "Asahi Shimbun" reported on August 23 that Sino-Soviet representatives held a conference in Chita in the first half of August, and that the Chinese representatives participating in the conference totaled sixteen people, discussing issues related to Japan for a week. This kind of rumor was already denied by the Soviet official on August 5. "Asahi Shimbun" is now rehashing the old story. TASS specially authorized an official statement to solemnly declare that this report is purely fabricated and absolutely inaccurate.

Editorial

### Conjecture, Ideals, and Illusions

British Prime Minister Churchill's speech the day before yesterday formally announced that the United States and Japan are conducting important negotiations on the Far East situation. If we only try to interpret this speech, we still cannot get a relatively clear idea of ​​the specific scope and goals of the US-Japan negotiations. But generally speaking, there are of course three possibilities: (1) Thoroughly force Japan to accept the democratic countries' views on the future world situation, which includes canceling the East Asian New Order, withdrawing from the Axis alliance, and complying with the Nine-Power Treaty's provisions on China's territorial sovereignty. This is the most fundamental solution. (2) In order to meet the urgent needs of the current situation, the UK and the US, on the issue of the Tripartite Pact, ask Japan to provide guarantees that it will not respond to the German and Italian war against the UK and the Soviet Union. On the issue of Japan's foreign expansion, they will force it to make a promise not to continue advancing south or north. (3) Otherwise, in order to reduce friction between each other, negotiations will begin to resolve various outstanding issues, such as the withdrawal of expatriates, the freezing of funds, etc. Judging from the unusually solemn tone used by Churchill, it seems that the scope of these negotiations is far more than the resolution of outstanding issues, and the US Secretary of State Hull's statement also clearly indicates the broadness of the issues involved. But judging from the reactions of China, the US, and the Soviet Union to Churchill's speech, it does not seem that there is a strategy to fundamentally resolve the aggression of the East first. Because, given the current situation, if we want to fundamentally resolve the Eastern incident, we must resort to force; at the very least, countries such as the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union must separately engage in large-scale displays of force, and China's own large-scale counterattack is one of the most critical prerequisites. In short, before countries such as China, the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union launch a large-scale military action and diplomatic response, it seems that the simple diplomatic maneuvers of any one or two countries will never be able to force Japan to comply. So comparatively speaking, the second possible speculation mentioned above is more approximate. However, the content of these US-Japan negotiations is, after all, a concrete event, and before it is revealed, we can only wait for the answer of future facts with great attention and concern. What its content is will of course determine its outcome, and will further exert a very significant impact on the entire situation in the Far East and even the world.

In his speech, Churchill once again emphasized the UK and the US's unified awareness of the current world crisis, and made the greatest determination to move towards the path of thoroughly defeating the aggressive forces in the East and the West and building a new world ideal, regardless of everything. Indeed! We only need to take a comprehensive look at the various events that have occurred in Europe and Asia in the past two or three months, and we will feel very shocked both in terms of time and space. The opportunity for the forces of justice to turn danger into safety is truly a close call! Assuming that the United States had a trace of complacency, and did not pass the "Lend-Lease Act" in early spring this year, and resolutely announced its determination to thoroughly defeat Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the Soviet Union had a trace of fluke observation, and did not firmly refuse when Germany and Italy requested to pass through to attack the Near East, then, what the world situation would be today, of course, no one dares to say. Even on the British side, if Germany's peace offensive had not been stopped head-on early on when Hess flew to England, then the formation of the current anti-aggression front would have become a big question. Therefore, the formation of the anti-aggression front has reached the final time limit for realization in the first half of this year. In terms of space, the only land area that European aggressive violence has not yet broken through is the corner of Soviet Ukraine and Turkey. If Germany and Italy could pass through this area this spring and extend into the Near East, then undoubtedly, it would definitely be able to reach India and join hands with the violence lurking in the East, causing the forces of darkness to envelop the entire Eurasian continent. The separate defeat of the two groups of violence in the East and the West must be in the east of Thailand and the west of the Near East, which is also very obvious. Therefore, countries such as China, the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union, which first and foremost realized the urgency of time and the narrowness of space and resolutely formed a front against Eastern and Western violence, will certainly not have any actions of reversing the course and withdrawing their defenses today and in the future. Rumors of the revival of appeasement that have appeared in the past two days are of course groundless.

In fact, looking deeper, what the two powers in the East and the West are fantasizing and hoping to see today is not only the revival of appeasement. As Churchill said, the secret lies in carrying out individual strikes. For example, as far as Western aggressors are concerned, they fantasize that the UK and the US will sit idly by for a long time, so that they can attack the Soviet Union with all their strength. They also fantasize about dividing the UK and the US internally with a peace offensive. Even after occupying Ukraine, they still seem to have not given up the illusion of suddenly seeking a compromise with the Soviet Union and turning to attack the British Empire with all their strength. As for the Eastern violence, they fantasize about forcing appeasement from the UK and the US with a threatening posture, and exchanging the slogan of advancing north for blocking the Yunnan-Burma transportation and stopping aid to China. As for the Soviet Union, they dream of exchanging the Red Army's withdrawal from the Far East and the cessation of aid to China on the pretext of temporarily not responding to Germany and Italy. All of these things have already been completely shattered in front of the resolute statements and measures of the authorities of countries such as China, the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union, and are no longer worth mentioning. All the work of the forces of justice in the future lies in stepping up cooperation on their own side, accelerating the defeat of the aggressors, and working together to build a new world in the future. All the conspiracies, illusions, and rumors of the Eastern and Western violence only indicate that they are becoming increasingly desperate.

In addition, Burmese officials have also informally expressed their welcome. It is heard that the delegation will depart at the beginning of next month. (Electric message on the 25th)

### Shaoguan Implements Wartime Economy, Not Affected by Embargo

Hong Kong – Although Japan and other countries have issued freeze orders and implemented embargoes on exports, Shaoguan, the capital of Guangdong Province, and other parts of Free Guangdong have not felt a significant impact. Local merchants generally believe this is because Guangdong Province has become self-sufficient. Guangdong Province is now implementing a wartime economy, and even further restrictions may not cause serious repercussions. In addition to blockading the coast, Japan has also imposed a land blockade. The Hong Kong-Shaoguan highway has been cut off at Danshui. The Japanese in the occupied areas have ordered a ban on communication with the free areas. Shaoguan's wartime economy is now being fully implemented. Although the cost of living has risen sharply, general importers and exporters and transportation companies are making many times more profit. Many students have also abandoned their studies to engage in business, with profits exceeding the income of university professors. The most affected are school teachers and salaried civil servants, but the provincial government has provided subsidies for relief. General theaters, restaurants, and entertainment venues are experiencing abnormal prosperity. The authorities are now planning to reduce the opening of tea rooms. Due to fear of air raids during the day, shops are not open for business, so they are ten times more profitable at night. (26th International News Agency)

### Soviet Troops Cross Iranian Border, Advance Over Forty Kilometers; British Troops Land in Persian Gulf to Protect Iranian Oil Fields

Moscow, 26th TASS – According to a telegram from Tbilisi, in accordance with Article 6 of the Soviet-Iranian Treaty of 1921, Soviet troops have been ordered to enter Iran. On the morning of the 25th, our troops crossed the border and advanced 40 kilometers in the areas of Atbir and Toris. The advance of Soviet troops is continuing.

London, 26th Reuters – According to responsible sources here, British troops encountered some resistance in Iran. A communique was issued by Simora this morning regarding British military operations in Iran, stating that General Wavell's forces have occupied the Naftishah oil station and the small town of Khosravi. British troops did not encounter serious resistance, and the Iranian people showed no signs of hostility. Troops transported by British aircraft have taken steps to protect the families of British employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Iranian oil fields are located in the southwest of the country, with pipelines leading to Baghdad. British troops are currently advancing from various locations in Iraq, and more troops are continuing to land by sea at Bandar Shahpur in the Persian Gulf. In northern Iran, Soviet troops have crossed the border from at least two points in the Caucasus, and are now advancing towards Tabriz and Ardebil. It is reported that late last night, Soviet troops had penetrated 25 miles and were continuing to advance. Tabriz is 60 miles from the Soviet border, with a population of over 200,000, and is the second-largest city outside of Tehran. Ardebil is close to the Caspian Sea, and its surrounding area is not large. Another Soviet force is now advancing from the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea, encircling Achaibakin in northeastern Iran. British aircraft have scattered leaflets over the Iranian capital, explaining the reasons for the British action and stating that Britain has no quarrel with the Iranian people and has no designs on Iran's independence and territory. As for whether British and Soviet forces intend to converge, it is not yet known, but it seems unlikely to happen in the near future. Currently, British and Soviet forces will each occupy a region.

London, 26th Reuters – The German official news agency reported that British troops are advancing into Iran from Iraq in three directions. One route starts from Rawanduz and Rawat (100 miles northeast of Mosul), with the aim of meeting Soviet troops at Achaibakin. The central route is currently advancing from Kanikin towards Khosravi (100 miles northeast of Baghdad). The southern route's area of activity is in the Persian Gulf area near Bandar Shahpur and the Abadan oil region. The Soviet advance is towards Ardebil (25 miles west of the Caspian Sea) and Tabriz.

Iranian Troops Poorly Equipped, No Match for Anglo-Soviet Allied Forces

Cairo, 26th Reuters – Near Eastern countries were comforted by the news of the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, as it was known that Iran was a weak point in the large front line extending from West Africa to Singapore. It is not yet known whether the Iranian army will resist, but even if there is resistance, it will not be as extensive as in Syria. The Iranian army has about 19 divisions, which are said to be well-trained but lack modern equipment. It is rumored that its air force has only ten modern aircraft, and the number of German-made tanks it possesses is very small. Germany may now send troops by air to assist, but since the Soviet Union is cooperating with Britain, Germany will find it difficult to transport troops by air. British and Soviet troops can quickly establish contact by advancing from Iraq. This is the first step in establishing a front line from Murmansk south to the Near East. People in Cairo are increasingly anxious as the joint Anglo-Soviet war in Iran gradually unfolds. The Egyptian princess is the wife of the Iranian crown prince, but apart from this, the cultural relationship between the two countries is not significant, because although Egypt and Iran are both Islamic countries, they belong to different sects. Non-official observers believe that the Iranian war will take two forms: (1) the shortest route for British and Soviet forces to meet; (2) a rapid advance north from Bairah in northern Iraq.

Turkey Offers Guarantees to Britain and the Soviet Union, Resolves to Strictly Maintain Neutrality

Ankara, 26th United Press – The British and Soviet ambassadors here formally assured Turkey yesterday that neither Britain nor the Soviet Union has any permanent political or territorial ambitions towards Iran. This assurance was given to Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu, who in turn assured the British and Soviet ambassadors that Turkey would continue to maintain neutrality.

Ankara, 26th Huitong News Agency – The Iranian ambassador to Turkey, Kazemi, visited Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu yesterday morning to inform him of the Soviet invasion of Iran. British Ambassador Hugessen also visited the Turkish Foreign Ministry yesterday morning.

Ankara, 26th Reuters – Although Britain and the United States have fully informed Turkey of all developments regarding Iran, the news of the troops crossing the border still caused considerable surprise, as it was unexpected to happen so quickly. There has been no official Turkish reaction yet, but it is generally believed that if war breaks out, Turkey will declare that it will remain neutral. The Turkish people are not concerned about Britain's actions, but they cannot be said to welcome the Soviet Union's actions. However, the Soviet Union's declaration that it will withdraw its troops as soon as possible has indeed eased possible anxieties.

Istanbul, 25th Havas News Agency – It is generally expected here that Turkey will declare neutrality regarding the Iranian war. Regarding this matter, Moscow Radio today published the secret clauses of Article 6 of the 1921 Soviet-Iranian Treaty, which stipulates that the Soviet Union may occupy Iranian territory when necessary. The Sadabad Pact signed by Turkey and Iran is actually in conflict with this. Turkey may not be bound by the treaty.

Vichy, 25th Havas News Agency – Diplomatic circles here recently stated that the invasion of Iran by British and Soviet troops will cause serious repercussions in the Middle East. The main issue that urgently needs to be resolved is Turkey's attitude, as the country is now located in the center of the war and has signed treaties of friendship with Britain, Germany, and Iran, so its responsibility is extremely important. However, according to the Iranian-Turkish treaty, it does not include military clauses, so Turkey should be able to maintain neutrality in the Iranian war.

Britain Occupies Two Iranian Oil Regions, Encounters No Significant Resistance

Simla, India, 26th Havas World Telegraph Agency – The British military headquarters here issued a battle report stating that the oil regions of Naftishah and Galikeshirin in Iran have been occupied by our troops and encountered no significant resistance. The residents also showed no hostility towards British troops, and due to our rapid operations, the losses of the Iranian military were reduced to the minimum extent to avoid loss of life. In addition, we also used aircraft to transport troops to other oil regions to protect the families of British employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.

Istanbul, Turkey, 26th Havas News Agency – After the Anglo-Soviet allied forces entered Iran, the authorities here recently took emergency precautionary measures on the European part of the Turkish border. Since the 25th, people who do not hold special permits issued by the military authorities are not allowed to pass. Yesterday, many travelers on the Turkish-Bulgarian border were forced to return because they did not carry permits.

US Political Circles Attach Great Importance to British and Soviet Occupation of the Persian Gulf

Washington, 26th United Press – Political circles stated yesterday that if Britain and the Soviet Union use Iran as a supply route to the Soviet Union, the United States will play an important role in the Soviet defense. It was also stated that Iran is the most convenient and best route to transport supplies to the Soviet Union to maintain the Soviet resistance, especially its Baku oil fields north of Iran. It was also stated that the US fleet will undoubtedly play a historic role in this work, as the US will protect its supply lines in the Persian Gulf while continuing its protection responsibilities in the Pacific. It was also stated that Iran is the best and most likely outcome to see how the US can simultaneously assist Britain and the Soviet Union without having to withdraw its fleet from the Pacific. Observers believe that Churchill's promise to provide military assistance to the US in the event of war with Japan indicates that the US will protect its supply ships passing through the Pacific. Churchill said that there is no obstacle to the aid already promised to the Soviet Union, which clearly refers to Iran or Japan.

Rome, 26th United Press – The "Forum" newspaper published a telegram from Ankara yesterday stating that 15 Soviet divisions are concentrated on the Turkish border and estimating that 30 Soviet divisions have entered Iran.

### Japan Permits US Officials to Leave for Shanghai, Philippines Declares No Obstacles for Transit of Japanese Nationals

Tokyo, 26th Reuters – It is reported that 13 or 14 US government personnel, including about 10 from the Soviet Union, are scheduled to take a train to Kobe this morning in order to board the "Tatsuta Maru" for Shanghai on Thursday. Most of those who had originally purchased tickets for the "Nitta Maru" to the United States will also change to the "Tatsuta Maru". It is reported that there are also some newly arrived people in Japan, whose number is unknown, who are also eager to obtain cabin space on this ship. It is believed that there are 10 British nationals among them.

Manila, 26th Reuters – It is denied here that the 200 Japanese women and children who went to Shanghai yesterday aboard the "Southern Star" were subjected to strict restrictions, as reported by Tokyo. In fact, their luggage was inspected and sent out on the ship without any obstacles. According to the freeze order, the cash and securities they carry must not exceed the prescribed amount. A spokesman for the Office of the High Commissioner stated that the Japanese claim that Japanese nationals leaving the country encountered serious difficulties is an exaggeration. Luggage is inspected in accordance with regulations, but the inspection procedures are very fair and there is no undressing or anything like that. The seized cash and securities will be kept in custody and returned if no war breaks out. It is true that some cash and securities were confiscated on the ship, but the amount has not been announced. The Japanese Consul-General visited the customs authorities regarding the arrest of 17 Japanese for illegally fishing in Manila Bay.

### Full Text of the Soviet Note to Iran

Moscow (TASS), 26th – On the 25th, Molotov, the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, under the instructions of the Soviet government, sent the following note to Mohammad Seyed, the Iranian Ambassador Plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union: "The Soviet government, in view of the friendly sentiments of the Soviet Union towards the Iranian people, and in order to respect Iranian sovereignty, has always adopted a policy of strengthening friendly relations between the two countries.  The friendly policy between the Soviet Union and Iran can be confirmed by the notes sent by the Soviet government to Iran on January 14, 1918, and June 26, 1919. These notes describe the principles of the Soviet Union's policy towards Iran and the details of the agreements concluded between the Soviet Union and Iran.  The unchangeable principle of all agreements between the Soviet Union and Iran is to respect the independence and territorial integrity of Iran.

Soviet Assistance to Iran's Revival

Based on this principle, the Soviet government, in its note of January 14, 1918, declared the abolition of all agreements that affected the rights of the Iranian people to freedom and independent existence. The Soviet government abolished the funds that Iran should have paid to the Tsarist Russian government and stopped infringing on Iran's tax revenues. At the same time, the Soviet government also abandoned the consular jurisdiction that harmed Iran's national sovereignty (Russians could not be judged by Iranian courts based on this right). Afterwards, the Soviet government immediately returned some enterprises to the Iranian people (including railways, telegraph lines, and postal services). In addition, the Discount Bank and its assets were also returned to Iran. The actions of the Soviet government on January 14, 1918, and June 26, 1919, proved the government's will to assist Iran in achieving political and economic prosperity. In the Soviet-Iranian Agreement of February 26, 1921, the Soviet government declared the abolition of agreements signed between Iran and the Tsarist Russian government that hindered Iranian sovereignty, and implemented the cessation of the use of Ashurada and other islands near the coast of the Iranian province of Astara. At the same time, the Soviet government announced the abandonment of all rights to the loans lent by Tsarist Russia to Iran, because these loans were aimed at enslaving Iran. As for the Iranian tax revenue used as collateral for the loan, the Soviet Union also announced its abandonment. In addition to returning the enterprises listed in the 1919 note to Iran, the Soviet government also transferred the Sofia Island Mian Lake railway vehicles and the boats in Mian Lake to Iran. In the following years, the Soviet government continued to provide assistance in economic development, such as the trade agreement concluded between the Soviet Union and Iran on July 3, 1924, which granted Iran special rights in terms of import and export. In addition, the 1926 Water Supply Agreement, the 1927 Fisheries Agreement, the 1935 Agricultural Agreement, the 1936 Agreement on the Elimination of Locusts, the 1940 Trade Agreement, and all of its treaties are clear evidence of the Soviet Union's friendship with Iran. As a result of Soviet assistance to Iran, Iran has established large-scale sectors in the national economy (such as fisheries and cotton industry). Recently, the Soviet Union has taken further steps to strengthen and develop its economic relations with Iran. The Soviet Union has agreed to transport extremely important goods to Iran.

The Soviet Union Has the Right to Send Troops into Iran

Even at the time of the conclusion of the main agreement on February 26, 1921, both the Soviet Union and Iran were aware of the difficulties that would be encountered in the process of strengthening friendly relations between the two countries, and believed that anti-Soviet and anti-Iranian elements would use Iran as a base for attacking the Soviet Union. In order to eliminate this crisis, Article 6 of the Soviet-Iranian Agreement stated the following: "The contracting parties agree that in any of the following circumstances, the Russian Socialist Soviet Republic Federation shall have the right to send troops into the interior of Persia to carry out military operations, but after the crisis is eliminated, the Soviet government shall immediately withdraw its troops: (1) If a third party attempts to implement a policy of armed intervention in Persia; (2) If a third power attempts to use Persian soil to wage war against the Russian Socialist Soviet Republic Federation; (3) If a certain power threatens the border of Soviet Russia or its common allies, and the Persian government is still unable to eliminate this threat after Soviet Russia has issued a warning." From this point of view, the Iranian government has agreed that the Soviet government can take action to protect Soviet interests in Iran after the crisis described in the 1921 treaty occurs. At the same time, it has also been guaranteed that Soviet troops will withdraw from Iran after the crisis is eliminated. In the twenty years since the implementation of the 1921 agreement, the Soviet Union has never considered it necessary to invoke Article 6 of the agreement.

Nazi Conspiracies Threaten the Soviet Union

Although, recently (after the attack on the Soviet Union), the Nazi German conspiracies in Iran have further expanded, posing a major threat to the Soviet Union. German personnel occupy important positions in 50 parts of the Iranian government, attempting to disrupt Iran and involve Iran in the vortex of war against the Soviet Union. Nazi elements such as Radanovics, Hammoto, Meier Wilhelm, and Sapp, under the guise of serving in various German commercial firms, have organized terrorist groups, attempting to infiltrate Soviet Azerbaijan, the Soviet oil region of Baku, and the Turkmen Soviet Republic. On the other hand, they are plotting to launch an offensive in Iran. The recent arrival of the leader of the German secret agents in Iran is extremely active and is related to this matter. The leaders of the German secret agents, namely Hammoto and Meier, under the guidance of the German embassy, have formed military teams in German Hanley, preparing to move to Baku and other important Soviet border points at several points on the Iranian border, with the aim of setting fires and blowing up important buildings within the Soviet Union.

Activities of Germans in Iran

Throughout Iran, German personnel can be found supplying arms everywhere. Near Mianeh in northern Iran, they have stored 50 tons of explosives. Around German Hanley, they are conducting military exercises under the pretext of hunting. In addition, 56 German secret agents have infiltrated Iranian military factories, including the famous German spy Attle, who is stationed in the German commercial firm Klapproth, Radovi區, the host of Siemens, Quinn, and Wallf, the leader of German secret agents on the coast of North Erie Sea. The criminal activities of German personnel have undermined the principle of respecting Iran's territorial integrity and have turned Iranian soil into a base for aggression against the Soviet Union. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, Iran is full of crises. Therefore, the Soviet government has no choice but to immediately take various measures to defend itself in accordance with Article 6 of the 1921 agreement.

Britain and the Soviet Union Jointly Warn Iran

Since the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has three times (June 26, July 19, and August 16 of this year) asked the Iranian government to pay attention to the crisis caused by the activities of German personnel in Iran. On June 26, the Soviet government notified Iran that the Soviet government had obtained reliable information that German personnel in Iran were indeed plotting a coup. On July 19, the Soviet Union, together with Britain, once again asked the Iranian government to eliminate the activities of German personnel that could endanger the interests of Iran itself and its neighbors, and urged Iran to expel German personnel from the country, because the presence of German personnel in Iran posed a great threat to Soviet interests. Finally, on August 16, the Soviet and British governments urged the Iranian government for the third time to pay attention to this issue, demanding that it stop the activities of German personnel against Iran itself and Soviet and British interests, and expel German personnel from the country.

Iran Ignores the Soviet Union, So the Soviet Union Takes This Action

Therefore, the Soviet Union has issued warnings to Iran three times, but Iran has refused to take steps. This attitude is tantamount to encouraging German personnel to step up their activities. Therefore, the Soviet government has no choice but to send troops into Iran to defend itself in accordance with Article 6 of the 1921 agreement. This step is by no means aimed at the Iranian people. The Soviet government has no intention of undermining Iran's independence and territorial integrity. The military measures taken by the Soviet government are purely aimed at the crisis caused by the anti-Soviet activities of German personnel. Once this crisis is eliminated, the Soviet government will immediately fulfill its obligations under the 1921 Soviet-Iranian agreement and withdraw Soviet troops from Iranian territory.

### Soviet War Report Announces Withdrawal from Novgorod, Fierce Fighting on the Banks of the Dnieper River Continues, German Offensive Against Leningrad Blocked

Moscow (TASS), 26th – The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report on the night of the 25th, stating that on the 25th, our army fought strongly on all fronts. After fierce fighting, our troops withdrew from Novgorod. On the 25th, 46 enemy planes were shot down in aerial combat and on airfields. We lost 6 planes. Our Black Sea warships sank a German submarine.

Moscow (TASS), 26th – The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report stating that on the night of the 24th and the morning of the 25th, our army continued to fight fiercely with the enemy in the directions of Kexholm, Novgorod, and Dnepropetrovsk (west bank of the Dnieper River).

Leningrad (TASS), 26th – The Red Army is preventing the fascist bandits from advancing towards Leningrad with unprecedented courage. Hitler's troops continue to reinforce the area despite heavy losses, but they will never be able to break the determination of the people of Leningrad to defend their territory. Since the outbreak of the war, the people of Leningrad have been organizing a national army. Workers, artists, students, and writers have all received military training. Since Voroshilov issued an appeal to the people, the people of Leningrad have immediately armed themselves, vowing to defend their territory to the last drop of blood and crush the enemy. They are now fighting side by side with the Red Army. During the day, Leningrad is as usual. All shops are open as usual, and cinemas are also full. However, the enemy's threat has not been eliminated. The National Army is constantly moving to the front lines. At midnight, there is no one on the streets, only the sound of sentries' footsteps. The great fighting city and the city loved by the Soviet people have mobilized all their manpower to help the Red Army fight. Near Leningrad, the enemy will dig its own grave.

London (Reuters), 26th – The German offensive in the Leningrad area has made no further progress. It is not yet clear whether the German advance from Novgorod is aimed at capturing Leningrad or cutting off the important Leningrad-Moscow railway. The German troops advancing towards Leningrad from Estonia are now said to have approached Tallinn. It is expected that the Soviet army will be able to hold the city, as it is an important base for the Soviet Navy's activities in the Baltic Sea. A Reuters correspondent in Moscow claimed that if the rainfall on the front lines in the past 24 hours continues, it will have a great impact on the German army's actions. Most of the roads are now muddy. Nazi tanks will inevitably experience difficulties in western Leningrad and Ukraine. In Ukraine, the German army is now trying to occupy the entire right bank of the Dnieper River. The Soviet army is now fighting hard. There is no new news about the Battle of Odessa. Soviet propaganda claims that the navy has won another victory and has sunk a German submarine.

British and Soviet Troops Will Meet in the Caucasus to Open Up Transportation and Supply Lines

London (Reuters), 26th – London has not yet received confirmation that the German army has built a bridgehead on the Dnieper River. Therefore, the focus of the war is still west of the Dnieper River. According to current observations, the Dnieper and Petrovsk sluices have been blown up, but the Soviet government has not issued a formal statement on the destruction of the sluices. The fighting on the Leningrad front is still fierce, but there are no significant changes. Soviet troops in the Smolensk and Gomel regions are launching counter-offensives, but London has not received detailed reports of the counter-offensives. Both Soviet and German communiqués are extremely simple and do not mention any new developments in the Eastern Front. The Soviet communiqué stated that there was fierce fighting in Kexholm, Novgorod, and Dnepropetrovsk. The German communiqué stated that the war was proceeding satisfactorily according to plan. From this, it can be seen that there is nothing special to report and no progress has been made in the Leningrad area. Independent sources report that General Timoshenko's troops are launching a strong counter-offensive to relieve the pressure on the Dnieper River bend from the German army. The industrial center of the bend, Dnepropetrovsk, has been mentioned for the first time in the Soviet communiqué. However, there is no news that the German army has gained a foothold on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The German side has even admitted that the bridgehead built by the Soviet army is under attack, indicating that General Budyonny is still in control of the river. The Soviet garrison in Odessa is causing the German side to feel quite uneasy. The most important development is in the Caucasus region. British and Soviet troops are expected to meet in the area soon to open up this route for the transportation of military supplies and the deployment of reinforcements when necessary. This move will have a significant impact on the outcome of the war in southern Soviet Union, and the possibility of the British Air Force providing early cooperation should not be overlooked.

Germany Adopts New Tank Tactics to Avoid Heavy Losses

Ankara (Reuters), 26th – Observers claim that as a result of the destruction of most of the Nazi spearhead units by the Soviet army, the German army has now adopted a new tank tactic, stipulating that the maximum distance between tanks and infantry when advancing together must not exceed fifteen miles. At the latest, all tanks must rest behind the infantry.

### Australian Cabinet Decides to Remain in Office, Refuses to Transfer Power to the Labor Party

Canberra (Reuters), 26th – After a five-hour meeting, the Australian cabinet officially announced that the Menzies cabinet will not resign and will not hand over the government to the Labor Party.

Canberra (Reuters), 26th – The Labor Party preselection meeting opposed the coalition government and demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Menzies in order to allow the Labor Party to form a government. This decision has been communicated to Menzies today. The letter states the following: (1) Parliament is essential for the execution of the war effort; (2) Menzies' letter requesting the organization of a coalition government indicates that he does not have the ability to serve as prime minister and provide Australia with a stable government; (3) Opposes Menzies' claim that the Labor Party will not be able to achieve political stability.

### Soviet Guerrillas Appear and Disappear Unexpectedly, Germany Offers Heavy Rewards to Arrest Commanders

Moscow (TASS), 26th – A reporter for Izvestia wrote from the front: "The guerrillas under the command of the village chief of P village pose a major threat to the Germans. They fight unexpectedly, often suddenly attacking fascist troops, destroying soldiers, fuel tankers, ammunition, and food trucks. The German command has tried its best to track down the guerrillas and capture their commander, but all efforts have been unsuccessful. Germany, humiliated and angry, has issued a notice stating that anyone who captures one commander will be rewarded with 20,000 rubles in cash."

### British Ministry of Commerce Announces Embargo on Iran, Large Quantities of Indian Wheat Shipped to Iran to Provide Food for the People

London (Reuters), 26th – The Ministry of Commerce has recently issued an order prohibiting the export of all goods to Iran without a license from August 26.

Simla (Reuters), 26th – 60,000 tons of Indian wheat have been shipped to Iran to meet the needs of the Iranian people, because Britain has no ill will towards the Iranian people. Iran's usual supplies have been gradually depleted due to the demands of the Axis powers. India is currently trying to ship other supplies to Iran. It is estimated that there are about 3,000 Indians in Iran, most of whom work in oil fields and the northwestern region. The authorities will soon adopt a protection plan for the Iranian consulates in India.

### Yarn and Cloth: The Unpredictable Changes in the Current Situation Make Cotton Yarn Speculation Difficult; The Market's Sudden Rise and Fall Shows Its Anxiety

The recent yarn market has been rising and falling suddenly. This state is entirely caused by the anxiety of speculators on both the long and short sides. Currently, there are two arguments in the market. The bulls say that the current yarn inventory is shrinking day by day, and the cost of the factory is increasing without decreasing. The price of 32-count single yarn is firm and unchanged, and the price of miscellaneous brand yarn is also rising. The foundation of the yarn market should be consolidated. However, the sellers say that the peak has been seen, the international situation is still turbulent, and they tend to sell and grab hats. If this is the case, the market price will be erratic. The actual sales of customers are not as strong as the previous day. Because the market has seen a reversal, they are also temporarily watching. Because the 32-count yarn is as hard as ever, but the miscellaneous brand yarn was too strong yesterday, it has also fallen by dozens of yuan. Today, 805 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,709 yuan, and the low price was 1,683.4 yuan. In the afternoon, because people's minds were mostly bearish, the market continued to soften. The opening price was 1,687 yuan, and it fell to 82 yuan. Then it was heard that the yarn and cloth at the exchange was not offered by the dealers, and the shorts again robbed and patched up, and the price rose by 20 to 30 yuan. The cloth rose by 7 to 8 jiao to 1.05 yuan. Double Horse rose to 1,711 yuan, and the closing price was 1,710 yuan, higher than the morning high. From a fundamental point of view, the yarn market should be stable, but speculators buy more as prices rise and sell as prices fall, making the market turbulent.

Double Horse opened in the morning. Because the exchange market fell after the previous day, people's minds were relaxed. The opening price was 1,690 yuan, and it fell to 86 yuan shortly after. Then it was heard that the futures market at the exchange rebounded, and the yarn market rebounded, rising to 1,707 yuan. Unexpectedly, the cloth price fell back, and the shorts used the peace atmosphere to put pressure again. The situation was mediocre, and the price fell to 1,680 yuan. At the same time, the same industry who bought a huge amount on the previous day suddenly released a large portion of their files because they had eaten too many amounts. The market fell step by step to 1,687 yuan. After the closing, it was made to 1,682.3 yuan. The statistics of the turnover in half a day were 8,870 bales. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 370 Fellow Traders 8,500

Statistics 8,870

The futures market situation of Jin Double Horse is extremely uneven in the turbulent atmosphere. Rumors are frequently spread by all parties, and it is impossible to determine whether it is bullish or bearish, which makes people uneasy and unable to rely on. Therefore, sellers throw out at high prices, and those who see low prices and pull up are also not few. Therefore, the market price rises and falls suddenly, and ultimately rises. When the market opened in the morning, the US cotton fell again, and the factory orders were very weak, so the futures yarn was affected, and people's minds mostly turned downward. The selling of floating longs and shorts was especially crowded for a while. The opening of the September issue was 593 yuan, a drop of 7 yuan, and the October issue was 625 yuan, a small reduction of 3 yuan. After entering, it recovered slightly because the bulls bought at low prices. Later, it was blocked by bad news, and those who took off their hands sold hard and sold a lot along with the decline of the factory orders. The market price suddenly turned soft again. The noon closing price was 1,610.5 yuan for the recent period, 1,627 yuan for the October issue, and 1,646 yuan for the November issue, with varying differences. The turnover in the previous market was 13,450 bales. In the afternoon, the market situation gradually rose with the firmness of the factory orders, and the footing seemed to be more stable. Moreover, the floating longs insisted on pulling up, and the exchange also saw a rebound, so the yarn price was firm. Except for the near term, which was flat alone, the far term rose by 12 yuan to 19 yuan. As a result, the September issue was 1,610 yuan, the October issue was 1,640.5 yuan, and the November issue was 1,664 yuan. Today is the birthday of Confucius, and the market is closed for one day. Looking at the trend, its footing seems to be quite fluctuating. The development of foreign countries and other unfavorable factors are the most obvious taboo for buyers. Therefore, those engaged in the industry should consider selling at high prices when they see high prices. The total turnover for the day was 23,530 bales, a decrease of 13,830 bales compared with the previous day. As of the 25th, the number of three-month deposit accounts was 23,490 bales, of which 7,580 bales were deposited in the September issue, 10,170 bales were deposited in the October issue, and 5,740 bales were deposited in the November issue. The opening and closing high and low prices for one day are recorded on the left (the net market price).

Opening Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

September 1,593.00 1,610.00 1,590.00 1,610.00 Unchanged

October 1,625.00 1,693.00 1,619.00 1,640.50 Up 12.50

November 1,657.00 1,666.00 1,643.00 1,664.00 Up 19.00

### There Are Two Benefits to Ordering American Cotton; Foreign Cotton Transactions Are Still Lively

The foreign cotton trading in Shanghai is still lively. All parties are undoubtedly interested in importing Brazilian cotton because they can obtain standard foreign exchange and a large number of tonnage, and they are making persistent efforts. At present, whether it is American, Indian, or Brazilian cotton, if the spot goods arrive in Shanghai in September and October, they have already been bought by various chemical companies and a few factories. Therefore, the work of foreign cotton merchants and foreign firms is to work hard to set up American ships or neutral country ships to facilitate the continued purchase of Chinese and foreign yarn factories. Yesterday, the turnover of American cotton was rare, and Brazilian cotton was still close to more than 1,000 bales.

The New York cotton market first fell due to President Roosevelt's rejection of the Smith Act, which affected the continuous settlement of the public and unfavorable spot trade, but then slightly rebounded due to a part of the shorts covering their positions. As a result, the closing price was 2 to 3 pounds lower than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market first rose due to speculators buying in and shorts covering their positions, and then fell due to longs taking profits, but finally rose due to shorts covering their positions and brokers buying in. As a result, yesterday's closing price rose by 1 to 4 rupees. It is also predicted that the opening market today will be quite flat, with little difference from the closing price.

The spot cotton situation was flat in the morning, but in the afternoon, because the yarn market was tight, coarse velvet cotton was especially popular. This is because cotton merchants are in high spirits. Therefore, although the turnover is not smooth, there is no shortage of ships sailing overseas in September and October, and it is difficult for people to expect prices to rise excessively.

### Grain: Rice Merchants Are Not Without Vigilance, Expecting a Sudden Drop in Rice Prices

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Anqing wheel of Taikoo Company arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday evening, carrying 18,195 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession to unload. The Jiangsu wheel also arrived in port in the afternoon the day before yesterday, carrying 8,510 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf in the French Concession. (Zu)

The foreign rice market yesterday saw a flat market in the early morning. Later, the rumor of a US-Japan compromise was unfavorable to the bulls, and the general big players were shocked. Chinese and foreign merchants continued to sell in the market. Although the importers were afraid of the sharp decline of the British and Chinese companies, they did not dare to order. However, since there is a large inventory in the market, and the goods on the way continue to arrive in Shanghai, the street lacks a smooth stomach, and customers have no need for it. Speculative transactions such as the leather ball gang dare not ask. The buying interest in the market is silent, and the selling sound is noisy. The current rice price has repeatedly gone down in the devaluation of floating households. Yinghua Si has a new arrival relationship, Dongzhan may be blocked, and they are willing to reduce prices to get rid of them. The closing price saw a huge drop of 3 to 4 yuan. If No. 1 Saigon has only opened at 128 yuan, No. 2 Siam is 114 yuan to 111.5 yuan, Min Dangbai is 130 yuan, ordinary is 124 yuan, Jue is 119 yuan to 117 yuan, Xiaojiao Bank Zhan is 115 yuan, Wai Zhan is 114 yuan, Tokyo Po is 106 yuan, and Broken Jian is 90 yuan to 86 yuan.

Glutinous rice also has a sluggish way out in this environment, and the situation is also tired. Fortunately, there is not much stock in the market, and the selling price has not changed much, only slightly softer and closer to Yun. The opening price of Hong Kong Gao Baiyuan was 129 yuan, and the final price was 124 yuan. The glutinous tea was 116 yuan and the final price was 111 yuan. The domestic glutinous rice is still in short supply and there is no market.

Thick and thin japonica domestic rice is completely different from foreign rice. It depends on the smooth source of domestic sources and our transfer. Therefore, although foreign rice fell sharply again yesterday, Duyou japonica rice was extremely tight due to the arrival of few goods. The selling price continued to be high at 1 or 2 yuan. The opening price of Nangang early rice was 153.5 yuan and 153 yuan, Wuxi original package special japonica rice was 155 yuan, the market was 150 yuan, and the final price was 145.6 yuan. Pudong new japonica rice has no market due to the interruption of the source. Attached notice: Today is Confucius' birthday, and the market will be closed for one day.

### Actual Sales Slightly Move, Flour Market Slightly Better

Today is Confucius' birthday, the market is closed for one day

Flour: The spot flour market yesterday was tired and then stable. In the morning opening, in the rumor of selling profits and the falling rice price, people's minds were all in vain, and retail investors gradually sold, and the market was quite loose. Jinlong flour opened at only 31 yuan and 8 jiao and a half, but in the middle of the street, actual sales moved slightly, and some capacity-holders took the opportunity to absorb at low prices, and the situation stabilized. Jinlong flour Puxi Zhan returned to 32 yuan and 1 jiao, and Pudong Zhan was 32 yuan, 4 jiao to 4 jiao and a half. According to the current Puxi Zhan, the flour in stock has been for a long time and the quality is second, so the selling price is cheaper than Pudong Zhan. There are still Pao Tai flour at 33 yuan and 6 jiao and a half to 4 jiao, and banana flour at 33 yuan and 4 jiao and a half, which are about half a yuan lower than before. The turnover was more than 20,000 bags.

Wheat: The purchase volume of each factory is small, because the goods from the near suburbs are scarce and difficult to buy. The purchase price of each factory has also changed little. It is heard that the purchase price of Japanese factories is 45 yuan, and the Chinese factories are still 48.9 yuan.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Watching, Market Situation Calm

The foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC listed exchanges were flat, the British and American exchanges in the dark market from stable to tight slightly loosened, Chinese merchants speculators and importers are still watching and waiting for change, I heard that there are small gains in the profits and Japanese banks, so the American exchange has softened to 4 yuan 8125, but to the afternoon in a calm situation, the bank has a little supply intention, the US dollar returned to 4 yuan 875, the British gold was cut long 03125, all returned to two accountants 90625, the turnover is still rare,

### Quiet Futures Market, Thriving Spot Market: Initial Dip Followed by a Significant Rebound of Seventy Dollars

Yesterday, the Shanghai gold market saw heated and volatile trading. Spot prices initially fell before rebounding, while futures continued their downward trend, primarily due to the HSBC's small counter settling the US dollar exchange rate at 5.3125 yuan, pressuring the market at 6,555 yuan. There was increased closing of positions, with sellers eager to liquidate. However, with over thirty days remaining until the September contract's expiry, potential exchange rate fluctuations made it difficult to defend. Consequently, the 6,700 yuan level triggered buying by those with short positions, pushing the price back up to 6,740 yuan before retreating again. The market closed down eleven yuan, with light trading overall. Cash transactions were comparatively active, as many participants on the futures exchange also engaged in spot trading. The market opened in the morning continuing the previous day's weak momentum, falling by 150 yuan. Yee Foong, Chin Cheng Kee, and Cheung Wo sold 200 taels each, with Cheung Wo selling an additional 50 taels from Tian Yuan, all at 9,150 yuan. Tian Yuan then sold 20 taels to Chin Yik Tai, followed by resales of 10 taels each to Ho Shing and Luen Hing. Tai Foong and Chin Cheng Kee sold 50 taels, while Chin Yuan and Cheung Wo each bought 30 taels. Chin Cheng Kee then sold 10 taels to Shun Yuan, and Sz Tze sold 100 taels. Yung Cheng sold 80 taels to Cheung Hing, all at 9,100 yuan. At 9:45 AM, Cheung Wo sold 60 taels to Cheung Hing and 40 taels to Tak Foo, all at 9,110 yuan. Later, securities firms, Chaozhou banks, and silver shops saw the low prices and started buying, gradually pushing prices up. Tian Yuan sold 10 taels to Tai Kang Run. At noon, the price rose to 9,300 yuan. Tai Kang Run later resold 30 taels to a certain silver shop at 9,280 yuan. In the afternoon, Chin Cheng Kee sold 20 taels and Yung Foong Yue sold 10 taels, all bought by Cheung Hing Yung, at 9,280 yuan. Afterwards, there were fewer sellers, resulting in Yee Foong Chin selling ten taels to Fook Hong Yung at 9,350 yuan. Finally, with limited sellers, the price reached 9,370 yuan, a rebound of seventy yuan compared to the previous day. Jewelry gold was up ten yuan, calculated at 960 yuan. Today is Confucius's birthday, and both the gold and foreign exchange markets are closed for the day.

Futures Trading Sees Minor Gains

The market opened at 9:15 AM at 6,725 yuan per bar (ten taels), up two yuan. Traders with long positions at Shing Tat sold, gradually declining to the 6,700 yuan level. Soon after, Chin Cheng Kee and Wang Hing Yung slightly absorbed the selling pressure, gradually raising the price to 6,740 yuan. Sz Tze and Lih Tai sought to sell, pushing the price back down to 6,715 yuan. The market closed at noon at 6,718 yuan.

Swaps (August rolling into September) had buyers posting 150 yuan to sellers, with reduced transaction volume.

Jewelry Gold Attempts to Fall But Halts

Regarding the asking price for jewelry gold per tael from silver shops, Tai Tung Hong and Sun Tung Hong lowered prices by ten yuan at 9:15 AM and another ten yuan at 9:20 AM, to 930 yuan. At 10:20 AM and 10:40 AM, prices gradually rose by twenty yuan. At 3:30 PM in the afternoon, prices rose again by ten yuan to 960 yuan (buybacks reduced by fifty yuan), a gain of ten yuan overall.

### Foreign Exchange Returns to Calm

### Stabilization Fund to Convene in Hong Kong; Two Experts Summoned; Prepared to Depart, Travel Date Uncertain; Shanghai Exchange Rate Management Plan Imminent

Dr. Taylor, the American expert dispatched by the Exchange Stabilization Fund and stationed in Shanghai for half a month, and Mr. Hall-Patch, the British member who recently arrived in Shanghai to investigate the true situation of the foreign exchange market, suddenly received an urgent telegram from the Hong Kong temporary office of the Exchange Stabilization Fund yesterday morning, urging them to depart for Hong Kong immediately. They are to attend a joint meeting with Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, as well as the Chinese member, Mr. Xi Demao, and the American member, Mr. Fox, who recently flew to Hong Kong from Chongqing, to finalize and approve the issue of foreign exchange management in Shanghai.

Both Have Prepared to Depart for Hong Kong

Since the Exchange Stabilization Fund announced that it would supply foreign exchange for essential goods at the new price starting August 18, Dr. Taylor, stationed in Shanghai, has been discussing the basic principles of foreign exchange settlement with relevant banks in Shanghai for days. Furthermore, with the dispatch of British member Mr. Hall-Patch to Shanghai to participate in the meeting, an implementation plan has been formulated. This plan stipulates that the Hong Kong Exchange Stabilization Fund will implement the plan centrally, but the plan is subject to approval. Therefore, it is necessary for the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee to hold a full meeting. Taylor and Hall-Patch will give a detailed report on the situation of the Shanghai foreign exchange market and submit the plan drafted in Shanghai for discussion and final decision. According to sources at the Metropole Hotel and the British Embassy, Taylor and Hall-Patch remained in Shanghai yesterday, but they are indeed prepared to go to Hong Kong. Their travel date has not been disclosed by relevant parties, but it will not be too long.

Legitimate Needs Will Be Supplied

Yesterday, sources from relevant banks pointed out that the Chinese legal tender is increasingly consolidated as the Exchange Stabilization Fund strives to maintain the exchange rate. If legitimate merchants request foreign exchange and can prove that the imported goods are necessities and goods from allied countries, they will be able to obtain US dollars at 5.34275 yuan or British pounds at 3.1875 yuan. In addition, China's foreign exchange stabilization fund and existing foreign exchange reserves are extremely abundant, sufficient to meet any legitimate needs.

Price Declines Expected in the Future

As for the drop in the exchange rate of the legal tender in Shanghai, there are many reasons, such as the diversion of customs revenue, the import of Japanese goods into the occupied areas, black market speculation, the escape of funds from the mainland and the concessions, the inability of the Chinese government to enforce power in the concessions, and the speculation of importers. If the government maintained the status of the legal tender at the past exchange rate, the result would be beneficial to importers of non-essential goods and arbitrageurs. However, it is a wise move for the authorities to seek a more natural price for the exchange rate of the legal tender and to supply foreign exchange for essential goods at this price. It should not be regarded as a genuine weakening of the legal tender. The high prices are not actually the result of the weakening of the legal tender, but merely the result of speculation and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. Once the foreign exchange settlement method is strictly implemented, prices are expected to decline.

Established Procedures Awaiting Approval

Regarding the foreign exchange settlement methods drafted by Dr. Taylor and Mr. Hall-Patch in the Shanghai banking community, they have in fact been endorsed by various banks and importers. This plan will be submitted by Taylor and Hall-Patch to the upcoming full meeting of the Exchange Stabilization Committee in Hong Kong for discussion and approval, and will then be fully implemented. From the above, it can be seen that the results of the implementation are: first, the consolidation of the foundation of the legal tender; second, the decline in prices; and third, the protection of import trade. If the above four points can be fully achieved, most of the evil forces in the city can be eliminated. After Taylor and Hall-Patch go to Hong Kong, Taylor will still come to Shanghai to take responsibility for supervision, and Hall-Patch may return to Chongqing with other members. From all aspects, this Hong Kong small-scale meeting will have unprecedentedly satisfactory results.

### Public Buses Planned to Resume Service Yesterday but Experienced Temporary Setbacks; Misunderstandings Resolved but Insufficient Time to Drive Buses; Authorities Are Making Every Effort to Mediate

Workers at the British-owned China General Omnibus Company demanded increased allowances and improved personnel management systems. They went on strike the day before yesterday. After mediation, it was decided to first meet two preconditions, and it was originally scheduled to resume work yesterday morning. Due to temporary setbacks, the resumption of work was not successful. The authorities have been making every effort to persuade workers to resume work to maintain public transportation.

Temporary Setbacks

The preconditions negotiated the day before yesterday stipulated that the company would do its best to improve the personnel management system and accept the principle of increasing worker allowances. After the workers first resumed work, further open negotiations would be held. Thus, yesterday morning at 6:00 AM, maintenance and transportation workers went to resume work. At the company gate on Connaught Road, some workers were not very satisfied with the preconditions, resulting in setbacks, and the resumption of work was not successful. After receiving a report, the authorities immediately dispatched personnel to persuade the striking workers to comply with the preconditions and resume work first, and dispatched a large number of detectives to protect them.

Accepting Advice Until 11:00 AM, the workers accepted the advice and went to resume work again. Because they had not contacted the company in advance, there was a misunderstanding with the Russian manager, and the workers' resumption of work failed again. Subsequently, the company invited worker representatives to explain the misunderstanding. However, the workers who were preparing to resume work had dispersed one after another. Currently, the company and the authorities are trying to persuade the workers again, promising that the authorities will be responsible for mediating the issue of increasing worker allowances and preventing the company from dismissing workers without cause. There is a possibility of resuming work today.

### Situation in Shanghai Suburbs Remains the Same; Travel Requires Inspection; Hongkou Temporarily On Alert Due to Sniping of Japanese Soldiers; No Closure of Small Streets in the West District Yesterday

The Japanese side is busy erecting iron wire netting along the railway lines in Fan Huang Du, Xin Long Hua, and Zhongshan Road, preparing to investigate the residents there. At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese side suddenly blocked the Baoyou Road intersection from the North Railway Station to the concession with iron barbed wire, cutting off traffic. As a result, train passengers from Nanjing to Shanghai could not enter the concession and waited at the Maichulu Road intersection, numbering no less than several hundred. It was not until around 10:00 AM that it was opened and traffic resumed. It is said that this temporary blockade was a temporary precaution arising from the sniping of two Japanese soldiers on Huaqing Road the previous night.

Everything as Usual in Contiguous Areas

The situation in areas contiguous to the concession remains the same. Only Yuyuan Road and the intersection of Great Western Road temporarily have iron nets erected, divided into entrances and exits. In addition to three special police officers, there are also two Japanese military police inspecting pedestrians and vehicles. That is, the areas around Xujiahui, Tushanwan, and Hongqiao Road have not had any obstacles placed at all, only prohibiting pedestrians from carrying objects in and out. The rumor that small lanes have been closed is inaccurate. As for the Suzhou Creek bridges, they were opened and closed intermittently yesterday, and the iron gates of the French Concession's 16th Wharf were also closed yesterday morning. Residents entering the Nanshi are subject to strict inspection. Everything else remains the same.

Closure Said to Occur in West District Small Streets

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that, according to responsible sources, the Japanese military authorities are currently closing off all the small lanes in the Hongqiao and Xujiahui districts in order to more strictly curb the infiltration of undesirable elements. According to the Japanese military authorities, residents of Chinese nationality in the Hongqiao and Xujiahui districts will be affected by the closure, but foreigners will still be allowed to travel freely. Residents of these two districts must travel on main roads guarded by Japanese sentries so that the Japanese side can conduct inspections to prevent anyone from taking action. The start date of this new restriction could not be confirmed, but it is rumored to be implemented starting tomorrow (27th).

Entry and Exit of Hongkou Subject to Strict Inspection Yesterday

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that, at 9:00 PM yesterday (25th), two civilians employed by the Japanese Army in the Hongkou district, Shimoji Nobuyoshi (36 years old) and Suto Shigeyoshi (26 years old), were suddenly attacked at the intersection of Seward Road and Boone Road. The assailants escaped. Shimoji was shot eight times and died on the spot. Suto was also shot in the head and chest and was rushed to the hospital, where Japanese military doctors performed emergency treatment. He died of his injuries at 12:30 PM today (26th). The Japanese naval authorities are still conducting a major investigation in the Hongkou district and are strictly searching pedestrians and vehicles entering and leaving Hongkou. As a result, traffic was congested on the bridges over the Suzhou Creek this morning, and passengers had to get out of their vehicles so that Japanese sentries could conduct careful searches. According to the shooting case yesterday morning, it was the third attack on Japanese people in the Hongkou district in the past week. The previous Japanese civilians who were assassinated were employees of Japanese cotton mills.

### Store Clerk Reading Movement Extends to All Industries; Companies and Firms Issue Letters of Recommendation; Three More Schools Offer Shanghai News Free Slots

First Batch of Qualified Students to Be Announced Soon

The Shanghai News Reading Scholarship Fund for Industry and Commerce Employees, since advocating the store clerk reading movement, has seen a daily surge in managers and responsible persons from various companies and firms certifying store clerks applying for scholarships and coming to the office to complete the procedures. To support this movement, several more cram schools and vocational schools have continued to send letters to offer special free slots, demonstrating the enthusiasm of society for mutual assistance and sympathy for industry and commerce employees. The details are as follows:

Store Clerks From All Industries Apply

Since the start of the application process for industry and commerce employees, in just three or four days, the applications received have been classified and found to be from various companies and firms, which can be said to have spread to all industries. For example, Sincere Co. Ltd., Wing On Co. Ltd., Shanghai Power Company, Renji Hospital, Jimin Hospital, Sanyu Industrial Company, Leung Sang Kee, Wing Hong Real Estate Company, Yifeng Winery, Dahubao Customs Broker, Jiancheng Trading Company, Sanyu Underwear Company, New Asia Bookstore, Baoan Insurance Company, Ruifeng Hardware Store, Xieda Rice Store, and Daya Bank, among other companies and commercial firms, have all had responsible persons issue letters certifying employees requesting scholarships. In addition, many staff members from Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Commercial Press, and China Book Company have also contributed opinions on extracurricular tutoring, which is admirable.

Shorthand, Bookkeeping, and Conversation Free

Yesterday, this newspaper received letters from various schools willing to offer special free slots for industry and commerce employees. (1) The Miller English Night School at Zhengxing Girls' High School, No. 162 Fuxu Road, wrote: "There are many aspiring 'vocational youth', but due to the drive of life, they have no time to study during the day, and extracurricular tutoring is also hampered by economic difficulties. In view of this, our school has set up ten free slots for advanced classes (the advanced level only has one class, and the intermediate level has two classes, A and B, for a total of thirty slots) to do our best to contribute and support. Any vocational youth who are interested in using their spare time can be recommended for admission as long as your office investigates and confirms that they are poor and of good character. The school offers the following special elective subjects: grammar, translation, shorthand, bookkeeping, conversation, etc."

Commercial Knowledge, Twenty Slots Reserved

(2) The Moses English Tutoring School, 5th Floor, Pudong Mansion, Chengdu Road, wrote: "In order to support your newspaper's store clerk reader movement, we have specially added twenty free slots. Any students who are interested in tutoring English commercial knowledge can be recommended for admission as long as your newspaper verifies that they are poor by September 2. Please send a letter of recommendation before September 2."

National Language, Bookkeeping, Classes Offered Early Morning

(3) The Chinese Vocational Tutoring School, 5th Floor, Sze Ming Bank Building, Nanjing Road, wrote: "We recently learned that your newspaper has launched a reader movement for industry and commerce employees, which we admire very much. Our school is an affiliated institution of the Chinese Vocational Education Society and has always been serving as its purpose. Recently, we opened free lectures on applied bookkeeping and daily English conversation, which is based on this purpose. In order to do our best to support your newspaper's reading movement, we have specially set up ten free slots in each of the language and vocational subjects, namely (1) the National Language Class, ten free slots, divided into Grade 1 (elementary level), Grade 2 (upper primary school level), and Grade 3 (junior high school Grade 1 and 2 level), with classes from 6:50 AM to 7:40 AM, five hours per week, and (2) the Elementary Bookkeeping Class, ten free slots, junior high school Grade 1 and 2 level, with the same class time as the National Language Class. Please have your newspaper carefully check those who are ambitious and worth cultivating. Bring a written proof at the time of registration and be placed in the appropriate grade. There is no fee."

Process Applications, Hope for Speed

The staff of this newspaper are currently engaged in reviewing and investigating those employees of industry and commerce who have submitted applications for scholarships. Since various extracurricular cram schools and vocational schools will be opening in early September, we sincerely hope that store employees who have already received application forms will complete the application procedures as soon as possible. This newspaper plans to announce the first batch of approved names on September 1 to facilitate the completion of enrollment procedures in advance. For those who submit applications later or who will not be affected by the school's class time, we will continue to review and announce them in succession. In addition, this newspaper would like to thank all vocational schools, specialized schools, and cram schools that generously donate one "Shanghai News free scholarship" for the benefit of out-of-school employees. However, for those schools that have set class times, this newspaper will expedite the enrollment procedures for all employees as soon as possible to live up to the schools' kindness to young people. However, time is tight, and we sincerely hope that all schools can provide considerable convenience to the entrants within their possible range and that all schools can indicate the tutoring subjects and times in detail so that aspiring entrants can refer to them.

### French Municipal Council Studies Looser Restrictions on Electricity Usage; Recent Oil Imports Nearly Equal to Previous Year; Shanghai International Settlement Decides to Restrict Excessive Electricity Use

The Shanghai Times reported that an employee of the Shanghai French Tramways and Electricity Company stated yesterday (25th) that if the company's current fuel reserves are not significantly reduced, the electricity consumption in the French Concession will not be subject to greater restrictions. The company's recent

Fuel Imports

are nearly equal to those imported last year. However, the Municipal Council's Restrictions Committee is giving careful consideration to the issue of electricity consumption and is studying requests for looser implementation of current restrictions on a daily basis. These requests are judged separately based on whether they are appropriate, the source said. The French Concession has implemented restrictions on electricity usage since last year, stipulating that users within the concession who exceed the specified monthly limit will have the excess electricity deducted from their limit for the following month. If they exceed their limit again in the following month, they will be

Disconnecting Power

as punishment, and power will not be restored until the excess usage is paid in full. The Shanghai International Settlement's measures for punishing excessive electricity use have recently been approved by the Public Works Department, aiming to conserve the Shanghai Power Company's gradually diminishing fuel reserves.

### U.S. Court Temporary Judge Sworn In

Mr. Lawton, the Chief Justice of the U.S. Consular Court in this port, was formally sworn in yesterday at 11:00 AM after receiving an order from President Roosevelt the day before yesterday, specially appointing him as Temporary Judge of the U.S. Court in China to replace Judge Helmick, who is returning to the U.S. for vacation. Mr. Collins, Clerk of the U.S. Court in China, administered the oath. Those present at the scene included Mr. Shields, U.S. Attorney for China, Mr. Waterting, Chief of Purchasing for the U.S. Navy in this port, and staff members of the U.S. Court in China. It is understood that, in addition to trying the Tytell Bau embezzlement case, Lawton will also handle other affairs of the U.S. Court until Judge Helmick returns to Shanghai. However, the date of the Tytell case trial has not yet been decided and is not far off.

### Shanghai Free French Leader, Aigrain, Has Been Released; Details of Trial in Saigon Unknown

The Shanghai Times reports: Shanghai received news yesterday (the 25th) that Mr. Aigrain, a French businessman in Shanghai who was arrested on the morning of April 9th, has now been released after being detained in Saigon for four months. Friends in Shanghai were pleased to hear this news.

Aigrain is currently still in Vietnam.

Details of his release have not yet been received. Aigrain was the leader of the Free French movement in Shanghai and was originally the chairman of the Shanghai French Veterans Association. He was later replaced by order of Vichy. On the morning of April 5th, Aigrain was suddenly arrested at his apartment on Route Lafayette, Rue Cardinal Mercier, by the French naval authorities and taken aboard the French gunboat "Garnault". The French authorities did not specify what crime Aigrain was accused of.

It was rumored that his detention was related to the escape of several sailors from the French gunboat. Aigrain was taken to Saigon for trial two weeks after being detained, and rumors circulated that he had been transferred to France. After that, there was no news, and only now has news of his release arrived. Details of his trial in Saigon are still unknown. The English-language "China Press" also reports that Aigrain & Co. in this city has no information about the whereabouts of its owner, Aigrain, nor do they know if he is already on his way back to Shanghai.

### Argentine Club Selects Miss China

The Shanghai Refugee Association, to raise funds for the relief of foreign refugees without support, is sponsoring the 1941 "Miss China" competition. Last night at 9 pm, it was held at the beautiful Argentine Club on Avenue Haig. Tickets were five yuan per person, and all proceeds will be used for the Refugee Association's relief efforts. Many beautiful Chinese and foreign women participated last night. However, the election results will be announced next Tuesday, still at the Argentine Club. The winner selected as "Miss China" will receive a prize of 1,500 yuan and will be interviewed by Mr. Paul Chai, the Shanghai representative of an American film company, for a film shooting test. Then she will travel with him to America to visit Hollywood. The second prize is 750 yuan, the third prize is 500 yuan, and the other seven runners-up will each receive a prize of 100 yuan.

### Debts Involving Hard Silver Dollars Should Be Calculated According to Legal Tender

The Ministry of Finance states that hard currency silver dollars have long been replaced by legal tender. Disputes often arise in civil debt relationships, and some contracts even openly state that a certain number of legal tender dollars is equivalent to one silver dollar, which affects the legal tender system. The Ministry of Finance has issued a separate circular to each province to strictly prohibit this. If silver dollars must be converted for debt obligations, the official exchange rate set by the Ministry of Finance at that time should be used for the calculation.

### Compiling Methods for the Cost of Living Index for Chinese Staff (Continued from Yesterday)

— Cai Zhengya

How to Keep Accounts

Keeping accounts is not difficult in itself; the difficulty lies in perseverance. The best method is for the whole family to have a small notebook and record expenses and income at any time. In the evening, this is given to the housewife to enter into the account book. However, this is for the average family and should be adapted to the circumstances of each family, focusing on simplicity and ease of use. If it is too burdensome, it may not be sustainable. Keeping accounts is a good habit, and if a family has detailed records of income and expenses, it can create a budget year by year, month by month. Why should income and expenses not be able to balance each other? Based on this, even if it is not for compiling an index, it is necessary to promote it. If children learn this from a young age, it will be very useful for the future.

Family Selection

The standards set by this office for selecting accounting families are divided into six items, which have already been reported in the newspapers and will not be repeated here. However, there are still several points that need to be clarified: (1) The phrase "does not rely on income from ancestral property or parental subsidies" refers to large amounts. If there is a small amount of ancestral property or occasional parental subsidies, they can still be selected, as the emphasis is on "independence." (2) The phrase "resides in the service unit without paying rent" refers to those who pay no rent at all. If a small amount of rent is paid, they can still be selected. (3) The phrase "salary is limited to no more than 1,000 yuan in legal tender" refers to income. There are no regulations regarding the amount of expenditure.

Of the accounting families selected by this office, those with incomes below 500 yuan should account for 70%, and those with incomes between 500 and 1,000 yuan should account for 30%. This is because there are more families with lower incomes, and the proportion must be such. Income and expenses should also be normal. If the income is meager and the expenditure is huge, with a large difference, it is abnormal. For example, if the income is only 200-300 yuan, but the expenditure is as high as 2,000-3,000 yuan, and there are other means of support, it is abnormal. In abnormal cases, there may be concealment when keeping accounts, with more reported as less, or less reported as more, so the compiled index cannot be accurate.

This office plans to solicit 500 accounting families, but to reach this number, it will take several times the effort, because some may not be able to maintain it consistently, or the records may not be usable and must be strictly selected. If the records are detailed and consistently maintained, the time, manpower, and financial resources spent by this office can be greatly reduced.

Account Books Are Strictly Confidential

This office strictly keeps the information recorded by each family confidential. After receiving the application letters, this office will number them. The account books will only contain the number, not the name. The analysts will not know whose book it is, so there is absolutely no possibility of leakage. The statistical staff have received considerable education and know how to respect themselves, so applicant families can rest assured.

Procedures for Issuing and Collecting Account Books

Regarding the procedures, after receiving the application letters, this office will review them and send a letter of registration. At the end of September, each family will be sent an account book and accounting instructions, as well as an envelope with the address of this office printed on it. After completing one month of records, the account book should be mailed back on the first of December without needing to add postage. The account books must be returned on time each month for review and analysis. After three months, we will send an inquiry about rent and servants' wages every three months and ask for a reply.

The Contribution of This Research

After the index is compiled in the future, the impact of price increases and decreases on life will be easily seen, which can be used to adjust salaries and subsidies and mediate disputes between employers and employees, so there will be a standard to follow. In addition, there are other contributions, such as nutrition. When the study on the living standards of Westerners was compiled, the Lester Institute of Medical Research was asked to conduct a detailed analysis, and it was found that Russians were malnourished, and British and American residents consumed too much sugar. Few Chinese people are physically healthy, and tuberculosis is common, which is related to nutrition. Nutrients are not about quantity or high prices, but about balance. With these detailed accounts, once analyzed, we can study this in detail. This is only one of the issues, mentioned as an example, and will not be elaborated further.

In short, this decision to compile a cost of living index is a matter of public interest and relies on the cooperation of people from all walks of life to achieve success. I would like to thank the Industrial and Social Affairs Department on behalf of the community. (End)

### Teachers and Staff Should Quickly Apply to Be Accounting Families

The Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council is soliciting staff families to keep detailed records of income and expenses for three months to compile a cost of living index. As seen in various newspapers, people from all walks of life have been applying recently, but the number of teachers and staff from primary and secondary schools is still insufficient. This is because schools are still on vacation, and it is more difficult to contact them. However, considering the population of this city, primary and secondary school teachers and staff occupy an extremely important position. Since the index represents all stages of staff, it must be distributed evenly. Teachers and staff should actively participate for their own sake, so as to provide a reference for the education authorities to improve their lives and focus on education. Those who wish to apply can send a letter directly to the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council on Jiangxi Road.

### Manager of China United Trust Company, Yan Chengde, Was Kidnapped Yesterday; Five Armed Bandits Snatched Him Away in a Car

At around 8:55 yesterday morning, a kidnapping case occurred at the entrance of Lane 666, Tiantong Road (intersection of North Shansi Road), namely Baoqing Lane. The kidnapped person was Yan Chengde, manager of China United Trust Company at 270 Beijing Road, a native of Shaoxing, 50+ years old, residing at No. 33, Baoqing Lane, Lane 666, Tiantong Road, Shanghai. His wife, Shen, is 58 years old, and they have five sons and three daughters. Except for the eldest son, Yan Liucun, who is working at the Shanghai General Post Office, the other four sons are still in school. The three daughters have all been married. Yan has a chartered car for transportation. Yesterday morning, at around 8:50, Yan finished breakfast at home, dressed in a light gray pongee long gown, and as usual, the driver Zhao Er was pulling him to the company to work. Unexpectedly, just as he exited the entrance of Baoqing Lane and was about to turn the corner, five bandits who had been lying in wait suddenly rushed out, all armed with guns, and blocked Yan's car, not allowing it to proceed. First, they beat up the driver Er with fists and feet and forced him to stand aside, not allowing him to make a sound. Then, they dragged Yan Chengde from the car and forced him into a black-plated car with rental permit No. 9681 (the permit may be fake), which was parked there in advance, and sped off westwards without a trace. The driver, seeing the bandits going far away, rushed back to Yan's home to report. Yan's wife and others immediately reported the incident to the Huishi Police Station in that district. The police authorities immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and took the driver back to the police station for questioning. They immediately ordered their subordinates to investigate.

### Barber Shop Owner Shot; Seriously Wounded in Chest and Back

At 3:04 pm yesterday, a bloody incident occurred on Tiantong Road. Wang Yingde (43 years old, native of Yangzhou), the owner of Zhenxin Barber Shop at 804 Tiantong Road, was wearing a gray Pulis suit and trousers at the time of the incident, with only a undershirt on his upper body. He walked out of the shop to buy goldfish at the entrance. As he was bending over, two men suddenly jumped out from the roadside. One of them pulled out a gun and fired two shots at Wang, hitting Wang's chest and back, causing him to fall to the ground injured. After receiving the news, the police quickly dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene, but the murderers were already gone. The injured person was taken to a sanitarium for treatment. It is said that the injuries were very serious. It is reported that Wang used to work somewhere. His wife's name is Wang Xiuhua, and she is currently an actress in the Yangzhou troupe at the Great World.

At around midnight yesterday, a man and a woman in No. 187, Dazhan Road in the Public Concession, simultaneously attempted suicide by taking poison. They were discovered by their family and sent to the hospital, where they recovered. It was later learned that the man's name was Xu Weiyu (18 years old), and the woman's name was Cao Meimei (17 years old), a dance hostess. Xu often went to dance and was deeply in love with the woman, hoping for a lifelong relationship. However, the woman's parents depended on her earnings as a dance hostess for their livelihood. If she married Xu, Xu would have to support the two elders. Xu was unable to do so, so he and the woman took poison at her home, intending to die together.

### Bomb Delivered to Yi Xin Printing Company

At 5:26 pm yesterday, a man suddenly brought a paper-wrapped package to the counter of Yi Xin Printing Company at 426 Jiangxi Road in the Public Concession.

He immediately reported the incident to the police, who sent officers to take it away for destruction and investigate the source of the bomb.

Zhang Jianglin, a native of Chongming, 45 years old, worked as a truck driver at the garbage truck depot of the French Municipal Council. He lived alone in Shanghai in a bungalow at the intersection of Route Massenet and Rue Jasi. At 3 pm yesterday, Zhang was at the vehicle repair shop of the French Municipal Council at No. 8 Rue Chévert. Garbage truck No. 749 was damaged and was being lifted by garbage coolies and mechanics. Wood was used to support it during repairs. Unexpectedly, the wood was oily and slipped, causing the lifted truck to fall. Zhang happened to be standing under the truck and could not avoid it, resulting in a head injury and instant death. The police received a report, sent detectives to investigate, and sent the body to the coroner's office for examination.

### Slippers Incident; Qian Jifu Sentenced to Imprisonment

Qian Jifu, a native of Ningbo residing at No. 132 Linqing Road, worked as an accountant at the British Jardine Matheson Soap Factory. On the morning of August 8th at 7:15, he went to work and accidentally stepped on the slippers worn by Ji Liangfu (29 years old, from Jiangbei), a worker at the neighboring Jardine Engineering Corporation, near the entrance. A quarrel ensued, resulting in a fight. Ji was fatally injured. Qian Jifu was arrested by Detective Liu Changji of the Yangshupu Police Station and sent to the Special Court. During the retrial, Qian's family agreed to pay the deceased 2,000 yuan for funeral expenses. He was ordered to be sent back to custody to await sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial and sentenced Qian Jifu to three years and six months of imprisonment for causing death by injury, as a warning.

### Shanghai Tongren Fuyuantang Appeals for Funding for Coffins

The hall has been handling various charitable activities in the Nanshi area for a long time. The annual expenses are all paid by income from real estate, which is used for distribution and payment. It has never sought donations from outside. After the war, the hall was destroyed, and the rented houses were mostly damaged by the war, resulting in very little income. Therefore, it mortgaged and borrowed money, assessing the urgency of its undertakings and carefully managing its resources to barely maintain the status quo. Recently, it has exhausted its resources and has no way to borrow money. Prices have also risen without limit. The most difficult problem it currently faces is the coffin donation. A coffin costs more than 50 yuan. The average number of coffins distributed monthly in Nanshi, Huxi, Pudong, and the French Concession is more than 600, requiring more than 30,000 yuan in national currency. This does not include the cost of coffin transport vehicles, coffin boats, the labor and food for the gravediggers, and all administrative expenses. This undertaking is of great importance to local sanitation and international public image, and to prevent epidemics. It should be carried out actively and cannot be stopped for a single day. Therefore, it has prepared donation registers and has begun fundraising, relying on kind-hearted people from all walks of life to donate generously in order to fulfill this righteous cause and benefit the poor. To prevent fraud, donations should be sent to the hall's office at No. 68 Ningbo Road in the French Concession, and receipts should be obtained.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor:

In the "700,000 Yuan Kidnapping Case" reported in the local news section of your newspaper, one of the arrested criminals is named Zhou Zhifeng. I believe that this is a case of the same name and surname. The Zhou Zhifeng in question is someone else. I have been working in the woolen industry for more than 20 years, and I have always been law-abiding. However, the outside world has been misled by this news, and friends and relatives have been coming to inquire. I am writing to you specifically to request that your newspaper publish a statement to avoid misunderstandings and correct the public perception.

Sincerely,

Zhou Zhifeng, Dachang Xingmao Ji Futai Foreign Firm

### Various Aspects of "Fully Booked"

— Fei Le

Heaven? Hell? Prosperity? Or something else?

If someone were to ask what the most distinctive feature of the isolated island is, "Fully Booked" might be all of it!

Don't underestimate these two simple words! "Fully Booked" truly contains so much heaven, so much hell! So much darkness, so much contradiction!

Theaters are the most proud creations of "Fully Booked"! Look at the neon signs that say "Upstairs and Downstairs Fully Booked," emitting proud light to demonstrate to the audience who are barred outside the iron gates!

"Please come early tomorrow," a defeat, but plan for tomorrow's victory and participate in this "full" group!

I wonder why the "bums" standing in front of restaurants are so fashionable? No, it turns out they are not bums, but people waiting for empty seats in the restaurant!

Despite your "2 yuan per person for a big meal" or "200 yuan and up for a full course," the isolated island has plenty of money, resulting in "Fully Booked"!

Hotels are already called "restaurants," so they are no longer places to "accommodate merchants"! Instead, what welcomes "guests" are mahjong, women, and alcohol! With these three things, are you still afraid that the "Fully Booked" sign will not be hung high?

"Hey, that's not dancing, it's simply frying peanuts!"

Don't laugh at this "bumpkin's" words, this is a true portrayal of "full" in the dance halls!

Languid music, enchanting women, foaming alcohol, and flying banknotes, flowing sweat, fill the ranks of this "fullness"!

A few years ago, the red strips of paper on telephone poles that read "Soliciting a Wife" were considered as boring as "Heaven and Earth"; now, they have become treasures. People are rushing to rent a top of a building, and the early bird catches the worm!

Have you ever seen the news that "108 people live above and below"? Today, the "full" situation in general residences is truly unimaginable! — squeezed like bedbugs in a palm awning, restricted like a coffin.

"Interception," "sleeping on the floor," "tin sheds,"— all these are products of "Fully Booked"!

The "Fully Booked" status of refugee camps is well-known. Since several have been closed, the remaining ones are even more "overcrowded."

The national crisis has abnormally spawned a group of people who send goods to warehouses. As a result, foreign warehouses and storage warehouses are all "Fully Booked."

……

"Prisons are Fully Booked!"

Life and environment have created a wide range of criminals — robbery, embezzlement, indecency,... and others.

The streetcar ticket seller pulls hard and yells: "Wait for the next one!"

The bus conductor says repeatedly to the gentlemen: Fully Booked!

Xiangsheng and Yunfei reply: "No empty taxis!"

The travel agency staff tells travelers: "The cabins on the Yong Sheng Lun are all booked!"

If you get sick and go to a "famous doctor" to seek medical treatment, get an ordinary number. If you wait from dawn to noon, you still can't get in, unless you take out a few legal tender bills to pay for the "priority number fee"!

Since there is sickness, there is also "death." When people die, they have to be sent to funeral homes. Therefore, funeral homes also announce that they are fully booked.

The casket deposit places of funeral homes can be said to be completely in the style of secondary landlords, with ones as wide as a "living room," ones as elegant as a "pavilion," and ones as cramped as an "attic." Funeral homes repeatedly build "new rentals," but it is still not enough. It seems that in the near future, casket deposit places will definitely have things like "transfer fee," "tips," and "security deposit"!

"Fully Booked"……

"Fully Booked according to seniority!" The bold words of the isolated island, that is all!

"Fully Booked"! Is it prosperity? Is it evil? Is it enough to make the isolated island proud?

I think this is just a mystery, and everyone can see it clearly!

### Seeing and Thinking

— Pei

Near Zhengjia Muqiao in the French Concession, there is a small restaurant that also serves cold drinks. A red sign hangs at the door, which reads: "Haha! The Autumn Tiger is here. This store has all kinds of cold drinks." Although this is an ordinary sign to attract customers, the word "haha" added on top is ridiculous.

The literary style is extremely unique. It should be commended immediately!

Twelve Unexpected Disturbances

Mei Bao knew her father's personality. If she didn't leave, if he left first, he would never agree. Therefore, she could only force a smile and followed behind Xiao Gouzi, walking step by step west along a small road made of mud and coal ash.

As usual, she looked back several times. She only saw her father standing straight in the cold wind, wearing a gray cotton-padded jacket and pants, watching her. In the past few times that Mei Bao went to the city, Qiu Haitang would often stand at the door of her own home or in the middle of the road, staring at her daughter's back, but she would always disappear by the fourth or fifth time that Mei Bao turned her neck to look. This time, not only did he send her all the way to the edge of town, but he also stood there staring blankly without going back. When Mei Bao had walked four or fifty yards and was about to turn the corner, she could still vaguely see this blurry figure from afar.

"Strange, I have been going to the city to study for three years, why does Dad seem so particularly worried this time?" She couldn't help but say softly to Xiao Gouzi.

Xiao Gouzi also responded quickly.

"It's all because you wanted to learn to sing opera! Miss, please don't mess around again in the future. I have served him for seven or eight years, and the only one he loves the most is you. If something really happens, it's not that I want to say anything to you"...Xiao Gouzi had been walking ahead with his head down all along. When he said this sentence, he turned back to look at Mei Bao: "Miss, how can you live with yourself?"

Although Mei Bao also felt that Xiao Gouzi's words were very correct, she still didn't believe that such a small dispute between herself and Shang Laoer would entangle or escalate to any extent. (195)

### Hopes for Teacher's Day

— Hu Luo

The living problems of primary school teachers have reached an extreme. Some superficial research is of no benefit to the facts. Many experienced teachers have turned to other professional sectors. Many teachers who are interested in education and willing to do research spend their entire time teaching at school and tutoring at home to make a living, thus unintentionally cutting off their interest in educational research. If this continues, the future of education will be quite unfortunate.

Caring people in educational circles, please extend your hands of friendship! Helping primary school teachers to live is helping the normal development and progress of education, and it is also helping the children of the next generation, including your own.

Improving one's own life should be achieved through one's own efforts. Fellow primary school teachers struggling on the line of hunger, please do not grieve or lament alone.

Here are two suggestions for fellow primary school teachers and people in the community, hoping to inspire further, more concrete and practical solutions:

First, hope for people in the community, educational organizations, and school authorities. Starting next semester, some enlightened school authorities in this city may allocate most of the increased tuition fees to teachers' salaries. However, some principals do not do so, so I want to ask the school authorities to give them more sympathy.

Second, hope for the teachers themselves: everyone should run consumer cooperative businesses for necessities such as rice and coal, and directly contact the Public Works Department, coal briquette factories, and other manufacturers to request price reductions in order to lighten the burden on teachers. For example, Yitai Hing Coal Briquette Factory used to have preferential measures for primary school teachers. If primary school teachers formally request it, they will definitely be able to obtain greater preferential treatment.

Fellow primary school teachers! Please earnestly commemorate our festival. We want to live, for the sake of education, for the sake of children, for the sake of our responsibility. We are willing to endure all suffering and get through this difficult era.

### On the Issue of Conducting a Taoist Ritual

— Xu Xun

After reading Mr. Zhu's article "Is It Time for Another Taoist Ritual?" the other day, I have a few small opinions to offer.

"Taoist rituals," this kind of thing, in Shanghai, mostly have other functions. This is just a way for idlers to make money.

They use the name of Taoist rituals to "persuade" the local residents, and the purpose is only to fill their own pockets and for their own consumption. In the current social situation, they will also say that the prices of various items are soaring and the expenses are huge, and they want each resident to spend at least two or three yuan in legal tender, and maybe five or six yuan or more. Most residents, seeing their usual behavior, some find them annoying, some are afraid of them (whether people or ghosts), and they will very painfully and readily reward them. They have also seized this psychological weakness and come to a "harvest" very naturally every year. (The places where this kind of Taoist ritual occurs are probably the places where ordinary people live, and they are not rich; therefore, it is said that they pay this money painfully.)

They, these special elements, each occupy an area, with fixed boundaries, and are not allowed to infringe on each other. However, in the past, during the season of Taoist rituals, we often heard news of them causing "all-out fights" and "brawls" due to disputes over territory.

In short, this act of conducting Taoist rituals poses problems for the safety of residents and the order of society. We should find ways to make them disappear.

The best way is for residents to refuse to pay this unnecessary amount of money at this time of expensive rice and firewood. Then, after they fail to receive money, they can save a lot of effort. (Royalties will be used for student aid)

### Small Statistics

— Fuxing

Suppose a "Taoist ritual" requires 200 yuan for tin foil, 30 yuan for colored paper, 100 yuan for Taoist priests or monks, 50 yuan for labor, 60 yuan for renting equipment, and 60 yuan for other miscellaneous expenses; if there are 1,000 alleys in Shanghai holding Taoist rituals every year, then 500,000 yuan is needed every year. If used for charity, many more people could be saved every year.

### Nonsense

Host: Your cooking skills are superb.

Cook: Why?

Host: Because the shredded pork you cook is so thin and short, so cleverly small that even cutting it with a microscope would be scary!

Cook: ...I'm afraid that's also because of money, right!

Host: ....

Barber: The hair behind your head is best cut a little shorter, otherwise it will grow a lot in a few days, which is annoying.

Barber: Sir! This is a very easy problem to solve. Just come twice more a month.

### Random Notes from Shouchun Kettle Studio

Insights on Catching and Releasing Cao (Part 2)

I think: in the future, when singing this play again, we should follow this method and add a few more people of different colors. It is okay to have all the people backstage come on stage. First, it will make Cao Cao kill to his heart's content, and second, it will make the people in the audience feel that it is terribly tragic. They run up from the entrance door and go down from the exit door. Although they are said to be killed, they will not actually injure a single hair. It is easy and effortless, why not give it a try.

(3) After Cao Cao kills the family members of Mr. Lü, Chen Gong catches up. Usually, Cao Cao turns around at this time and can raise his sword as if to chop down. At this time, Chen Gong looks frightened and sings the sentence "It scares my three souls and seven spirits." Usually, the person who plays Chen Gong thinks that his fear is because he is afraid of the bright and bloody sword in Cao Cao's hand, which almost chopped his own head off. So his eyes are still looking high while singing this sentence. Thousands of people perform this, and they are mostly the same. I alone feel that it is not so. I think that Chen Gong chasing down and up is to stop him from killing people and causing trouble. Unexpectedly, he was one step late and suddenly saw corpses lying all over the ground, heads rolling around, and fresh blood flowing straight out. He knew that he had heard of a great disaster, and he was afraid of this, not that Cao Cao would kill him. Cao Cao did not kill him either. Someone asked: Cao Cao's sword did pass over Chen Gong's head, isn't it very dangerous? I said, no, this is the method of coming on stage, deliberately making a sensational stroke. Cao Cao's sword and Chen Gong's head have no intention of getting close at all. Since this is the case, the appearance of Chen Gong when he comes on stage can still be done, and after doing it, quickly get up, walk a few steps forward, look at the ground and around, and then sing the sentence "It scares me", which is more appropriate. I wonder what the experts in the country think?

### Visiting Tianfeng Drama Club

— Lu Si

Recently, I heard that "Grievances in the Qing Palace" will be revised again and the cast will be changed. It is also said that Ying Yin may have the hope of appearing on stage, which is a very interesting thing. However, Tianfeng's next play "Gold Rush" has already been announced, and the exact situation is unknown. The reporter then visited the Tianfeng Drama Club and got the person in charge of the club to answer the questions. The records are as follows:

(Question): Is there any news that "Grievances in the Qing Palace" will be revised?

(Answer): Yes, because Mr. Yao Ke's first draft was relatively hasty, and when it was performed, it was too long, so many deletions and changes were made, so there were inevitably many unsatisfactory points. It was originally only prepared to be performed for ten days before rewriting, but later because there were too many viewers, it was impossible to stop, so it was extended to the present. Now Mr. Yao is determined to rewrite, eliminate the dross and retain the essence, so that it is more vivid and more powerful.

(Question): It is said that the cast will also be changed?

(Answer): Originally, it is difficult for actors to support heavy plays in hot weather. Now that there is a new version, several actors may take this opportunity to rest a little. However, most of the actors will still not be changed.

(Question): Are the newly changed actors basic actors of your club?

(Answer): Not necessarily, but in principle, we always give priority to using our own actors.

(Question): It is rumored that Ying Yin has accepted Tianfeng's invitation to participate in the performance. Is this true?

(Answer): Our club has not invited her, so there is no question of accepting the performance.

(Question): Is the new cast rehearsing well?

(Answer): Still in rehearsal. Recently, Mr. Fei Mu has been coming to the club every day to direct.

(Question): When can "Gold Rush" be staged?

(Answer): That depends on the situation of "Grievances in the Qing Palace".

(Question): What kind of script is "Gold Rush"? Is it being rehearsed now?

(Answer): This is a three-act comedy seven (more exaggerated than comedy). It is written by Bao Lei and directed by Luo Ming. It is currently in rehearsal.

At this point, I knew a little about the inside story, and then I resigned and left.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Li Mingdao

Chapter 15: Where is the powerful family that forcibly carries her home?

The poet followed and saw many figures in the ship's window. He shouted, "Yuanyuan, Yuanyuan!" It was pitiful that although Yuanyuan could hear the poet's voice in the cabin, she could not say a word to the poet at this time. She only hated that the secret messengers had come too late, which had delayed the big event. Probably it was her destiny, so what else could she say? Hua Hudie heard the shouting, opened the window, and poked his head out to take a look. He recognized the Jade-cherishing poet and gritted his teeth and said loudly, "Who is shouting here? Do you know that Father-in-law Tian is carrying the beauty back in the boat? Don't disturb Father-in-law, or you will be punished!" Hua Hudie said this clearly to the poet, making him despair of Yuanyuan and feel sad. It was also to vent his anger. But when the poet heard the words, he knew that Yuanyuan had been taken away by Tian Hongyu. He had wasted his efforts and caught nothing. He wondered how Yuanyuan would hate him. He watched the painted boat, unable to take back the beauty, and his hope was gone! Because he was anxious in his heart, he spat out a mouthful of blood, shouted "Oh," and immediately fell to the bow of the boat. But the painted boat had already hoisted a big sail, and eight oars were beating on both sides, flying towards the city. The boatman on the poet's boat hurriedly woke up the poet and carried him home. Tian Hongyu and his party returned to the city together and sent Yuanyuan to live in the guest house, where people were always watching over her. Tian Hongyu thanked Hua Hudie repeatedly and comforted Yuanyuan with all kinds of good words. But the sorrow in Yuanyuan's heart could not be concealed, and she shed tears in secret. At this time, she was like a bird in a cage, losing all freedom and being manipulated by others. Tian Hongyu got Yuanyuan, as if he had obtained the most precious thing. Because the vacation was coming to an end, he was eager to return to Beijing, so he took Yuanyuan and left Wumen. He went north safely all the way, and local officials took care of and escorted him along the way. Tian Hongyu tried every possible way to please Yuanyuan between the wheels and ships, wanting to make her smile. However, Yuanyuan hated her fate and had no chance to serve the talented scholar, so a Tian old man came out of nowhere and broke up her marriage with the poet. How desolate was she in her heart! Hou fought like the sea, and Xiao Lang was a stranger. I am afraid that she would never see the poet again in this life! (152)

### Twin Beauties

— Yi

Chen Yunshang has the nickname of "Favorite of Heaven" in today's film industry. In the past, costume films were popular, and she was the leading actress for many consecutive films. Recently, fashion films have been revived, and she is still the leading actress, always popular.

The production of "New Sisters" is gradually becoming tense. Chen Yunshang plays the roles of the sisters Qiyun and Qixia alone in the play in a special manner. The personality performances are completely different, and the psychological changes are completely different; one is a romantic and luxurious school, and the other is a loyal and simple school. The joint performance is very important from beginning to end.

The picture above is Chen Yunshang's "New Sisters" twin beauty picture, with a kind smile and deep emotions, specially sent to the entertainment world to share with readers.

### Small Biographies of Figures in the Pear Garden

— Written by Zheng Yuyi, Illustrated by Zhang Yizhang

(3)(4) Wang Yaoqing

Wang Yaoqing is the master of contemporary female roles. An elder of Qingyi, this is the only one remaining. However, Yaoqing has taken off her dancing shirt for more than a decade, and people regard her as a rare fruit, but they can only imagine her past, and can no longer use her skills to sell them to the world. Yaoqing achieved success very early. In her youth, she had already moved the nine cities and was praised as unparalleled. At that time, Tan Xinpei performed, and the Qingyi supporting role would not be pleasing to him if it was not Yaoqing, so Yaoqing's name became more and more famous. Yaoqing was a junior to Lao Tan and also benefited from Tan's promotion. However, she was arrogant and often refused to give in. Lao Tan loved her talent and instead accommodated her in every way, so it can be seen how successful she was in those years! However, Tan could not bear it for a long time, and eventually they separated. Yaoqing soon lost her voice and could no longer rely on her singing to compete with the latecomers. Her sharp edges were slightly restrained. Yaoqing's talent was outstanding, and her intelligence was extraordinary. After her voice failed, she devoted herself to Bai Kou's acting skills. She was good at portraying expressions in acting, and each play was different, showing her identity and personality. Her flag costumes were indeed unparalleled at the time. Although the late Dan corners all took Yaoqing as a model, exerting their strength to seek her likeness, no one could catch up with her. In the past ten years or so, her physical strength has become more and more weakened, and it is difficult for her to finish the scene even when singing Baikou with her own voice. Therefore, she has devoted herself to teaching her disciples in order to provide for her life. Her disciples are all over the north and south. It can be said that if the Dan corner does not receive Yaoqing's instructions, she cannot reach the upper class and gallop in the music scene to compete with her peers. Yaoqing is also proud of this. In the Pear Garden industry, the only people who can change the trend of the times are Jiao Tian and Yaoqing. Although they take different paths, they are all outstanding people!
