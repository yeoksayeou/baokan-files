### Fourth Anniversary of China's War of Resistance: Military Situation Increasingly Consolidated; Equipment and Training Improved; Ability to Manufacture Weapons; British and American Guarantees of Sincere Aid Boost Morale

Chongqing - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a letter to friendly nations today, outlining three main points in several thousand words, with very insightful language. (6th dispatch)

Chongqing - This marks the Sino-Japanese War as the largest conflict in Asia since Genghis Khan, involving one-quarter to one-half of the world's population. Although China has suffered numerous setbacks on the battlefield, its military situation today is more consolidated than it was four years ago. Even foreign military observers acknowledge that China now has more armaments, and its troops, on average, are more advanced in both equipment and training than they were when the war began. Since then, China has swiftly dispatched large armies to reinforce the front lines and sent well-trained young officers from the central government to assist, thereby dissolving China's regionalism. The independent status of troops in various provinces has also disappeared, and they have unanimously joined the ranks of the national army. This has further increased the courage of Chinese soldiers and civilians, shattering the previously held notion that the Japanese army was invincible. Military analysts believe that the current formation is best suited to the Chinese army's tactics, which involve avoiding major battles and inflicting heavy blows on the invading Japanese forces at every opportunity. This tactic has been very effective, causing significant damage to Japan in the war against China. China acknowledges its lack of heavy weaponry and inability to launch counteroffensives. In the near future, there is no hope of receiving sufficient armaments. Therefore, in the fifth year of the war against Japan, China will remain limited to a strategy of maintaining resistance and hindering the Japanese army, while enhancing its military equipment and supplies. Among these, there are numerous problems, one of which is political, and is also one of China's main issues: the conflict between the Nationalists and the Communists. Although the two parties disagree on major issues such as how to fight the war and how to organize the people, there is no sign of wavering on the fundamental principle of continuing the war against Japan. Both parties agree to fight on this issue. Although friction occurs between the two parties from time to time, everyone deeply believes that there will never be a day when they engage in open conflict because neither side is willing to concede to Japan. Regarding the maintenance of existing military equipment, China has established numerous small-scale arsenals in the interior over the past four years. These small arsenals specialize in manufacturing weapons, machine guns, mortars, and bullets. Before the war, even these weapons were supplied by foreign countries. According to Chinese officials, China is now self-sufficient in these light weapons. What China urgently needs are aircraft and artillery. Recently, the United States indicated that it would supply China with American aircraft and other materials under the Lend-Lease Act. This news has greatly excited the Chinese people, who believe that with this assistance, China will not only be able to maintain its existing military equipment but also increase its production of munitions. The issue of troop rations is also very important and should be included under the heading of China's economic situation. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek previously stated that China's war effort is "70% economic and 30% military," realizing that China would encounter economic problems in the fifth year of the war. Ordinary observers often overlook the fact that Japan's objectives in the war against China are equally focused on economics as on military matters. China's industry was originally weaker and more vulnerable than its military and political systems. In fact, the Japanese army has destroyed 80% of China's factories and has followed this by monopolizing or confiscating all of China's products and resources, such as coal and iron. In addition, they have imposed a tight blockade on China. During the war, China has only a small amount of light industry to manufacture consumer goods and no heavy industry to manufacture machinery. Although it is an agricultural country, it is not self-sufficient in food. Therefore, today's China can only rely on the remaining light industry salvaged from the war zone to produce a small amount of consumer goods in the interior, such as cotton textiles and paper, as a drop in the bucket. The assistance imported from foreign countries cannot be obtained in large quantities due to the Japanese blockade and transportation difficulties. The Japanese army has cut off China's food transportation, intending to create a major famine in China. The result has greatly surprised foreign economic experts, who concluded: "According to various economic principles, China should have already suffered economic collapse, but China's economy still survives and continues to function." This perseverance is difficult for foreigners to understand. The great harvests of 1938 and 1939 may be one of the main reasons why China defeated Japan's economic war, but prices have risen many times over, and the purchasing power of the legal tender has greatly decreased, while the amount issued has greatly increased. Last year, China's agricultural production was poor, and it is still difficult to say for sure this year. Since this spring, the government has sought several broad methods to cope with the situation. The Central Executive Committee has ordered that tobacco, alcohol, matches, and other items be monopolized by the government. It has also established a Food Department with broad powers to manage the transportation, distribution, and sale of food. It has also convened a national financial conference to discuss fundamental plans in detail. The decisions of the financial conference include changing the land tax to be collected by the central government instead of being managed by the provinces themselves, and the land tax will be paid in kind from now on. These measures can prevent speculation and hoarding and increase the government's revenue from rice. China's current situation truly warrants assistance, and if Japan invades the south again and touches the sphere of influence of Britain and the United States, it can obtain military assistance from Britain and the United States. Moreover, the establishment of the ABC front can greatly increase the morale of the Chinese people in fighting the war. In the future, the large-scale shipment of American materials and aircraft can more than compensate for the aid interrupted by the Soviet Union.

### Overseas Chinese Representatives in Malaya Broadcast to Chongqing

Dr. Lin Bengeng (transliteration) of Singapore, representing the overseas Chinese in Malaya, delivered a special broadcast from Singapore to Chongqing, stating that overseas Chinese are determined not to be swayed by the Japanese "sincerity and goodwill" declaration. Every time Chinese businessmen think of the plight of their motherland, they are heartbroken. Therefore, men, women, and children all feel that they have a responsibility to make the greatest sacrifices in order to contribute to and comfort those affected by the war. The overseas Chinese in Malaya and other places abroad firmly believe that the patriotic people of the motherland will never think of compromising before achieving victory, because they all know that the country is fighting for the freedom of defending justice and democracy.

### Japanese Casualties in China in Four Years Reach 2 Million; Chinese Casualties Far Fewer

Chongqing - Yesterday, the Japanese side issued a message stating that since the start of the war in China four years ago, a total of more than 3.8 million soldiers have been killed or wounded, while the Japanese army, including the Battle of Zhanggufeng, has suffered fewer than 100,000 casualties. The Chinese authorities will immediately refute this based on official statistics. The content is roughly as follows: In the first three years, the Japanese army suffered a total of more than 1.6 million casualties. In the fourth year, 6,762 large and small battles occurred. Except for a few larger battles, the rest were launched by the Chinese army. Therefore, in this year, the Japanese army actually suffered more than 336,200 casualties, bringing the total to about 2 million. As for the losses of the Chinese army, they are far fewer than those of the Japanese army. This is a well-known fact. (Havas World News Agency, 6th dispatch)

### Yang Guangzheng Calls for Support for the Cooperative Movement

Manila - On the eve of the fourth anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, Yang Guangzheng, the Chinese Consul General here, issued a statement saying that China has experienced indescribable sacrifices in the past four years and has become a great force in defending the temples of human freedom. Yang said that Chongqing is the last bastion of individual freedom, national independence, and democracy in the Far East. Yang called for support for the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Movement, saying that the shareholders of the cooperative are the shareholders of the future free and democratic world, and China's 3,000 industrial cooperative units have become the 3,000 pillars supporting China's wartime mechanism.

### Chongqing Launches Campaign to Save Gasoline

Chongqing - According to a leaflet issued today by the Chongqing Public Mobilization Committee, a "Save Gasoline" campaign has begun in Chongqing. The aim is to reduce monthly gasoline consumption. Current monthly gasoline consumption is estimated at more than 400 tons. The leaflet contains the committee's investigation of gasoline consumption, paying attention to consumption during air raids, as cars and trucks pour out of the city immediately after the alarm sounds. The slogan for saving gasoline has been determined by the committee and is being posted on walls in various streets. The leaflet quotes a national saying: "Don't drive a car to a banquet, don't drive a car to go shopping, don't drive a car to the theater, a drop of gasoline is a drop of blood."

### Dagu Tug and Barge Company Sells Ships

Dagu - The ships of the Dagu Tug and Barge Company have reportedly been sold. As a result, most of the tugs and barges in Tianjin will no longer be under British jurisdiction. This has a significant impact on the future of trade for the British in North China, as the ability of many trading companies, especially oil importers, to survive will depend entirely on the goodwill of those who take over the tug and barge company. The directors of the Dagu Tug and Barge Company are scheduled to convene a special shareholders' meeting on Thursday to report on the sale of assets. (Reuters, 6th dispatch)

Chongqing - Seventeen Japanese planes bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing last night. (Reuters, 6th dispatch)
Kunming - A small squadron of Japanese light bombers made a dive-bombing attack on a factory in the northern suburbs of Kunming yesterday. The air raid alert was lifted at 2 p.m. (Reuters, 6th dispatch)

### Open System Adopted; Chinese Finances Significantly Improved; Foundation Stronger; British and American Confidence; Overseas Chinese Remittances Benefit Balance of International Payments; Kong Xiangxi's Financial Report

Chongqing - Chinese Finance Minister Dr. Kong Xiangxi announced here today, "Because the financial foundation had been consolidated in the years before the Sino-Japanese War, and the wartime financial and monetary measures were prudent, China's financial front is stronger and more durable than that of the Japanese." According to Kong's announcement, it is a review of the Chinese financial situation four years after the start of the war against Japan. Kong detailed the various wartime financial methods adopted by China in the past few years, such as people's patriotic donations, reorganizing tax revenue, adopting an open financial system, and issuing wartime public bonds. Kong also expressed his gratitude on behalf of the Chongqing government to the world's countries (especially Britain and the United States) for their friendly assistance to China in the form of loans. Kong said, "This loan shows that all countries have expressed confidence in China's financial future and can represent a significant contrast, as the door to loans has now been closed to Japan." Kong also strongly praised the assistance given to Chongqing by overseas Chinese, saying, "The loyalty and generosity of Chinese expatriates are admirable. The funds they remitted to the motherland in the years before the war amounted to 300 million yuan per year, but since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, this has increased to 600 million yuan. This donation is very beneficial to reducing the imbalance in international payments." Kong continued when mentioning war bonds, "The most significant achievement of China's wartime finances is the government's determination to fulfill its obligations. China has worked hard to fulfill its obligations despite Japan's best efforts to obstruct them. China's creditors will not soon forget this glorious achievement." Kong subsequently pointed out that the adoption of an open financial system by Chongqing is a significant improvement in wartime finance. (International News Agency, 6th dispatch)

Chongqing - Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi expressed his gratitude today for the loans given to China by friendly nations since the Sino-Japanese War. Kong said, "This is sufficient to show confidence in the future of Chinese finance and is very different from Japan's inability to borrow from countries around the world." In reviewing China's financial front, Kong has changed the wartime financial methods (i.e., the people's patriotic donations, adjustments to taxes, the implementation of a public survey system, the issuance of war bonds, and foreign aid, and currency management, etc.). Kong acknowledged that newly issued bonds must reach a considerable number, but Kong pointed out that Japan's current national debt has exceeded three times what China owes. At present, China's burden per person is 20 yuan, while Japan's is 400 yen per person, the former being only one-twentieth of the latter. When Kong spoke of the inflation of Free China's currency, he said, "There have been many misunderstandings about the increase in the issuance of paper money and its impact on the currency situation. Fundamentally speaking, the issuance of paper money is not about having too much, nor about the statistical figures, but about fully satisfying the country's monetary needs." This is what should be noted. At present, the total amount of paper money issued in China has not yet reached the degree of saturation. In short, what is amazing about China's finances in the past four years is not that China's currency has suffered severe conditions, but that it has been able to skillfully resist the various difficulties caused by the war. No wonder there is deep faith in China's financial future at home and abroad. Kong then discussed overseas Chinese, saying that the loyalty and generosity of overseas Chinese are admirable. In addition to donating money to purchase bonds and invest, overseas Chinese have remitted huge sums of money to China. The amount remitted was 300 million yuan per year before the war, and has increased to 600 million yuan per year after the war. The characteristic of China's wartime finance is the government's seriousness in fulfilling its debts, and this fact may not be immediately forgotten by lenders. (United Press, 6th dispatch)

Editorial

### China and the World in the Past Four Years

Due to the complexity and intricacy of events in the universe, the causal relationship between certain things often cannot be as immediate as an echo, and the trajectory of history is not always a straight line. Even if objective conditions are fully met, the subjective expectations may not be realized, and complications are inevitable, or even reversals and contrary phenomena may occur at a certain stage. However, when viewed from a longer historical perspective, the cause and effect and laws can be identified, and people's ideals are not entirely contrary to reality. Examining the development of China and the overall world situation in the past four years is sufficient to clearly prove this point.

Four years ago, it was the time when the international front of aggression and the democratic front were in sharp opposition. However, the evils of the aggressors had just begun to sprout and had not yet been deeply recognized by the world. On the anti-aggression side, although there was sufficient strength and the possibility of thorough implementation to prevent problems before they arose, the beliefs and steps between them were very uneven. Several local mutual aid agreements in Europe were not sufficient to fully guarantee security, the Spanish Civil War did not prompt anti-aggression countries to be vigilant, and Britain's policy of appeasement was developing, while America's isolationism was still stubbornly adhered to. This was the general international situation at the beginning of the Far East War. Therefore, the general expectations of Chinese people for the international community at that time soon proved to be too high. Although widespread sympathy was universally issued from all corners of the world, actual assistance was very limited, and even the erroneous prejudices against the Far East that had been left over for many years still had considerable control. The League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Beijing proved their inability to deal with the Far East crisis. However, China firmly believed in self-reliance and unwavering determination, and did not feel the slightest disappointment or discouragement as a result. As a result, China's hard struggle and the aggressor's rashness and brutality soon made a deep impression internationally. Even in the heyday of the policy of appeasement, the great powers in the Far East had to find other ways to deal with the situation besides the original path. This can be seen in the fact that at the beginning of 1939, Britain and France followed the United States in sending strong ultimatums to Tokyo. As for the United States, President Roosevelt stated in a speech in Chicago shortly after the start of the Sino-Japanese War that he hated the immersion and deeply warned a part of the people's short-sightedness and complacency. In action, the abolition of the trade agreement after repeated resolutions of protests against Japan were ineffective was the only positive implementation. The Tokyo Agreement and the like proved that another opposite trend was trying to create unpleasant shadows in the crisis in the Far East. When the European war closely followed the outbreak of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, China's situation became even more difficult, but it was also appropriate to see that China had taken decisive action wisely, because if not, it would be difficult to avoid falling into a desperate situation at this point. The fact that it was already engaged in another war in the Far East was enough to strengthen and enhance China's international status. In Japan, it has gained new opportunities for expansion due to the European War, but the scene of the Soviet-German alliance has also hit its consistent national policy. The multiplication and division of the two results are still worthless. This situation lasted until the launch of the Western Front war in Europe. The unfortunate defeat of Britain and France last summer did give the Far East a major shock. After the defeat of the democratic country, it had no energy to take care of the Far East for the time being. Japan's desire to advance south was once again uncontrollable. As a result, the Dian-Vietnam and Dian-Myanmar roads were blocked one after another, and the Hanoi Agreement was concluded, forming the darkest page in the Far East political situation in three or four years. But China still did not waver slightly because of this. Britain soon recovered its faith and strength, and the conclusion of the Tripartite Alliance only clarified the division between the international community. America's concern for the Far East and aid to China have also reached an unprecedented peak since last winter. At that time, the situation of China, Britain, and the United States jointly resisting aggression had been formed, but there were still many consultations between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union. They had different positions on the European situation, and although they supported China in the Far East, they still did not have a coordinated pace. But this last crux was finally eliminated due to the outbreak of the Soviet-German war. After the twists and turns, what was finally formed was exactly the situation that the world had jointly expected four years ago. In addition to rejoicing now, recalling the various experiences of the past four years proves that the current situation is by no means accidental, and China has paid a great deal of strength and contribution to this, and at the same time, it can be seen that sound ideals are finally not deceiving!

The current international situation has unfolded a new vision. Although the joint anti-aggression of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union is still not without friction, the future is bright. In particular, in the Far East, with this gaining more help, and the other being propped up and wandering, it is not difficult to predict the mutual interests of both parties. As for the Far East and the world thereafter, there are naturally still many thorns and difficulties that exist, which need to be overcome with effort, and it is inevitable that there will be setbacks or detours again, but in terms of the entire trend and destination, it is not difficult to obtain a clear understanding from the evolution of these four years.

### It is Reported that the Japanese Imperial Conference Decided to Take a Wait-and-See Attitude Towards the Current Situation; Troop Deployment to the North is Not Permitted by National Strength; Pressure from the United States Cannot be Ignored

Havas Tokyo, 6th - Here, rumors have arisen due to the government convening an Imperial Conference on the 2nd of this month to decide on foreign policy. Some street talk says that the government has decided to advance north, with Vladivostok as the main target, while others say that it should still advance south. In fact, the defenses are tight, and the decision is naturally impossible to know. According to Japanese observers, the Imperial Conference on the 2nd has probably decided to take a wait-and-see policy for the time being and not participate in the war until the victory or defeat of Germany and the Soviet Union cannot be judged. In other words, as a result of this decision, the Emperor may not need to approve a plan, but to approve simultaneously many different plans, and allow the Supreme Command of the Japanese Army to choose according to the opportunity. As of today, Japan has encountered so many opportunities and so many different opinions that it has never been seen in Japanese history. The main question from now on will be to decide whether to continue to wait and see or to start acting. If you ask the Japanese for their opinion on this, most of them will advocate continuing to wait and see for the time being. But the Japanese all recognize that under the current international situation, Japan cannot be allowed to do nothing, so there will inevitably be a day when it is drawn into the vortex, so the question of whether to advance south or north must be decided as soon as possible. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Japan originally had a good opportunity to advance north, because Vladivostok is "a stubborn head facing the heart of Japan", and it is just right to resolve it at this time. On the other hand, after the Soviet Union's war against Germany, the threat to the border of "Manchukuo" has been lifted, so there is no fear of advancing south. Therefore, those who advocate advancing south or north each hold a word, and the gatherings are full of lawsuits. Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war on the 22nd of last month, Japan's line of sight has shifted to the north. The victory of the Russo-Japanese War is still not forgotten by the people today. Advancing north will certainly win the welcome of the people, while advancing south will inevitably be viewed indifferently by the people. Judging from the Japanese authorities, it does not seem very warlike. They all believe that the war against the Soviet Union will be a difficult task for Germany. In other words, even if the Red Army collapses, the Soviet Union can continue to resist in the wilderness of Siberia, and the Soviet Union still has 40 divisions stationed on the border of "Manchukuo" and has not been transferred to Europe. If Japan invades the Soviet Union, it will have to gather a large number of reserve troops. However, it is difficult to recruit such a huge force in Japan, and it is inevitable that it will have to be transferred from China. In addition, the attitude of the United States is also very concerning. The Japanese also recognize that the United States is extremely concerned about the fate of Vladivostok, because American aid to the Soviet Union will use this as an import channel. But if the Soviet Union is destroyed in the future, the United States' attention to Vladivostok will inevitably disappear with it. In short, the Japanese government will not take any action against the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union shows no signs of collapse. As for advancing south, it will not be implemented immediately, because if there is a sudden change in the German-Soviet war in the middle, Japan will be caught off guard and difficult to turn around.

### Tokutomi Argues that Japan's Policy Should Pay Attention to the Far East

United Press Tokyo, 6th - Tokutomi, a famous writer for the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, recently wrote that the entire country of Japan has completed all preparations to cope with any eventuality. The government must now resolutely pursue Japan's own path and not be influenced by outsiders. Tokutomi's remarks are very important, because this is the time when the government announced that Japan has formulated a policy to cope with the international situation caused by the German-Soviet war. Another important point is that Tokutomi himself is a member of the pro-Axis front. This front includes Mr. Toyama, Mr. Nakano, Colonel Hashimoto, General Nakamura, and many others. This generation has "strong suggestions" on the policy of the Japanese cabinet due to the Soviet-German war. Tokutomi suggested that Japan's path should be to focus on the Far East and not be bound by the Tripartite Alliance or the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty. He said, "In order to develop the East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere, the Anglo-American forces, the nests of the old order, should be swept away and cleaned. The so-called East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere should include at least the Dutch East Indies. This is a natural thing, because if it is not, there will be no East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere to speak of." He continued, "The China Incident must be resolved according to the international policy of Japan. In other words, if the Anglo-American forces are cleared away and the work of the East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere has begun to be carried out, then the China Incident will disappear automatically." Tokutomi went on to discuss Prime Minister Konoe's recent declaration that Japan will use its own strength, and that although Japan has encountered great obstacles, the future is still extremely bright, only requiring the people of the whole country to have a strong determination and absolute unity. He said, "The government authorities will from time to time warn the whole country, saying that the current period is a very period, and that a greater crisis will come soon, and therefore ask the people of the whole country whether they have prepared for it. However, we are now asking the government this question in return. We ask the government, are we ready to deal with any eventuality at any time? The whole country has already prepared. What is needed further is the government's determination."

### Changing Routes of Japanese Merchant Ships: An Obvious Goal to Expand East Asian Commerce

United Press, Tokyo, June 6th: Reliable sources say that Japan is reducing its shipping routes to meet wartime needs. The Japanese government has the authority to direct the routes and schedules of merchant ships. Due to the decrease in business in the Western Hemisphere and Japan's determination to increase and expand East Asian commerce, several shipping routes have been changed. However, the Philippines, due to U.S. export license restrictions, is not included in the expansion of East Asian commerce. Shipping companies here are deeply concerned about routes to New York, firstly because there may not be cargo on the return trip, and secondly because of rumors that the Panama Canal will be closed. Nippon Yusen Kaisha denies that it has terminated its Manila service, but after July, regardless of where the ship is going, it definitely will not accept passengers or cargo, causing cargo shippers to be unable to obtain space. The reason for this is unclear. Some ships will change their route to Dalian, which is noteworthy. Also, the K Company has delayed the sailing of the "Kimikawa Maru" to San Francisco by four days, now scheduled to depart on July 8th. A Japanese government spokesman yesterday denied that the government had recalled Japanese ships from the Atlantic and other distant places, but also said that ships from several distant locations have been recalled to cope with the shortage of ships. There are absolutely no other reasons. Rumors that Japan is preparing to advance southward are absolutely not credible.

### Matsuoka Visits the Palace Again to Report on the Current Situation

International News Service, Tokyo, June 6th: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, after meeting with the Emperor of Japan on Friday, was received by the Emperor again yesterday afternoon. Matsuoka immediately reported to the Emperor on the general global diplomatic situation.

### Japan Posthumously Awards Medals to Deceased Soldiers in China: The 20th Time Since the Start of the Sino-Japanese War

Reuters, Tokyo, June 6th: The Ministry of the Army and the Bureau of Decorations of the Cabinet announced today that posthumous medals would be awarded to 2,112 soldiers who died in battle in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins from September 1, 1937, to April 29, 1940. According to Japanese announcements of posthumous awards, this is the thirtieth such announcement, and since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese Army has issued such announcements a total of twenty times.

### Sassoon Arrives in Manila and Makes a Statement

Reuters, Manila, June 6th: Sir Victor Sassoon, a prominent British figure from Shanghai, arrived here by clipper and told reporters that what is urgently needed today is the united action of democratic countries, first seeking military victory and then economic cooperation. He does not approve of a new order system led by one country. He advocates that a delegation of representatives from democratic countries convene to discuss solutions to common problems. The current war is not related to race or religion, but is a struggle between democratic countries and totalitarian countries.

### British Newspaper Observes Japan's Potential Southward Advance, The Axis Powers Entice Japan to Cooperate

Reuters, London, June 6th: Both the diplomatic correspondents of The Times and the Daily Telegraph strongly emphasized the crisis of Japan's southward advance and the need for Britain to pay attention to developments in the Far East. The diplomatic correspondent of The Times stated that the news received in London in the past few days seems to indicate that Japan is currently pursuing its southward ambitions, intending to seek naval bases in southern Vietnam and Thailand. Although the matter is not confirmed, the remarks of Konoe and Matsuoka at the beginning of the week have already indicated that Japan will take some action, and this action is not against the Soviet Union. What we should know is that Japan has the right to send troops through northern Vietnam and has expanded its influence in Vietnam and Thailand. Both Vietnam and Thailand have good harbors, especially Cam Ranh. From here, an arc of 75 miles in diameter can cut off the line between the Philippines, northern Borneo, and Malaya. From the southernmost point of Thailand to Singapore, the distance is only 350 miles. The diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph stated that people in London are now closely watching the development of Japan's policy after Germany's attack on the Soviet Union. It is well known that Japan has a large number of troops in Taiwan, Hainan, and northern Vietnam that can be deployed. It is hoped that Japan will carefully consider and not hastily take actions that could threaten British interests in the Far East, as Britain will definitely not take such actions lightly. Judging from the situation, Germany has clearly been urging Japan to actively cooperate with the Axis powers again, and powerful figures in Tokyo are now also plotting to take advantage of the latest developments in the European war.

Reuters, London, June 6th: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that people in London are now paying increasingly close attention to the situation in the Far East. The frequent meetings of the Japanese cabinet, the cautious speeches of Foreign Minister Matsuoka, and the undisguised threats in Japanese newspapers against the Dutch East Indies all seem to be precursors to an imminent crisis. However, it remains a question whether Japan will advance rashly under the pressure of the Axis powers or driven by its own goals.

### Reports from Chongqing Indicate Conflicts in Manchuria and Mongolia: The News is Not Yet Confirmed, Tao Xisheng Believes Japan Will Attack the Soviet Union

United Press, Chongqing, June 6th: Newspapers here prominently published a Central News Agency report stating that foreign sources say conflicts have already occurred in Manchuria and Mongolia, but the agency added that this news has not been confirmed. Meanwhile, Tao Xisheng, a Japan expert who left Wang Jingwei's regime a year ago, published a statement in Hong Kong stating that Japan will definitely attack the Soviet Union, and it is only a matter of time. Tao said that Japan is waiting for an opportunity. Tao stated that Japan will attack Siberia from two directions, the first being a frontal attack on the coastal province and Vladivostok, and the second being a flanking attack through Outer Mongolia to cut off the Soviet Union's supply lines to Chita and Udinisk. Japan's preparations to advance northward cannot be interpreted as abandoning its southward advance. Once Japan completely occupies Siberia and Germany conquers Moscow, Japan will even more vigorously advance southward, while Germany will also begin its long-awaited attack on Britain.

Konoe Emphasizes Realizing the Co-Prosperity Sphere Again

United Press, Tokyo, June 6th: Japanese Prime Minister Konoe recently strongly stated that the time for Japan to realize the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to end the world's endless turmoil and enter into lasting peace has arrived. Konoe made this statement in a message to the National Service Association meeting, which was read out by the association's vice-chairman. The message also stated that realizing the Co-Prosperity Sphere could even be said to be what countries have been striving for for two thousand years. The 52 organizations that recently joined the New East Asia League have advocated forgetting old grudges and engaging in unity to achieve the Co-Prosperity Sphere advocated by Japan.

### Japanese Minister Without Portfolio Ogura Advocates Increasing Tax Revenue: Changes in the International Situation Hit Japan, Finance Cannot Rely Solely on Public Debt

United Press, Tokyo, June 6th: Newspapers here this morning published news from Osaka that Minister Without Portfolio Ogura yesterday advocated increasing tax revenue as a way to strengthen Japan's wartime mechanism. Ogura recently took a short trip to Osaka and said during an interview with reporters that changes in the international situation, referring to the international situation arising from the Soviet-German war, have placed a serious demand on the Japanese economy, enabling it to cope with any crisis at any time. Mr. Ogura advocated a two-point program: (1) Strengthening the government's economy starting from the current budget; (2) Revising the tax system. Mr. Ogura said that he firmly believes that Japan's wartime financial system relies too much on the issuance of public debt. He also said that he does not approve of a compulsory savings system, but the savings movement can be promoted through the "National Savings Association." Mr. Ogura also said that the government should re-examine its price control policy so that the government's low-price program can coexist with the current high standard of living.

### Philippine Exports This Year Continue to Increase

United Press, Manila, June 6th: Although Philippine exports have been slightly affected by the European war, the export volume in 1941 is still higher than in the same period last year. According to statistics from the Department of Commerce, the exports in the first four months of this year were over US$56,500,000, an increase of 9% over the same period last year.

### Soviet Army's Counter-Attack Victory on the Ostrov Front: Hundreds of German Tanks Destroyed, German Army's Attempt to Cross the River in the Central Sector Ultimately Failed

Reuters, Moscow, June 6th: The Soviet army launched a large-scale counter-attack three times yesterday. One was in the north, attacking the German army targeting Leningrad. The other two were further south, dealing with the two main prongs of the German army's pincer movement along the Napoleon Road to Moscow. This morning's Soviet communiqué stated that the German army in the city of Ostrov on the Tikhvin-Leningrad railway line had been repelled. Hundreds of German tanks and a large number of motorized infantry were annihilated. The Soviet army's counter-attack in the area of Polotsk, 135 miles northwest of Smolensk, repelled the German army that had crossed the Dvina River. The Soviet army also launched a third counter-attack around Borisov on the Berezina River, east of Minsk. The fighting was quite fierce. The Soviet Air Force bombed the Romanian Black Sea ports of Constanța and Sulina, and the Romanian oil city of Ploiești (north of Bucharest).

United Press, Moscow, June 6th: Moscow Radio announced this morning that a German mechanized unit had penetrated the Soviet border near Ostrov, Latvia, early today, but retreated with heavy losses. Ostrov is located midway between Tikhvin and Leningrad, right on the Soviet border. The radio station also cited an official communiqué describing the fierce fighting and saying that the German army on all fronts had been defeated. The communiqué stated that there had been fierce fighting along the 1,500-mile front of Ostrov, Polotsk, Lepiel, Borisov, Bobruisk, and Ternopol, and that a large number of mechanized and motorized units had participated. On the morning of July 6, enemy forces began to attack our army in Ostrov, but were repelled. 140 enemy tanks and a large number of enemy motorized infantry were destroyed. In the Polotsk area, the enemy attempted to cross the Dvina River, but our army counterattacked vigorously and drove the enemy back to the opposite bank. In the Lepiel area, our army firmly defended all defensive lines to resist the large number of enemy mechanized units. There was fierce fighting in the Borisov area. Our tank units counterattacked, inflicting serious damage on the enemy. Our air force also heavily damaged the enemy in Bobruisk. The enemy's repeated attacks were all contained. Sixty enemy tanks were destroyed. The communiqué continued, stating that as a result of the enemy's huge losses in this area, their pressure has been greatly reduced. In the Ternopol area, the advance of a large enemy force was blocked by our army's tenacious resistance.

TASS, Moscow, June 6th: The Soviet Information Bureau has issued the following war report: On July 4, there was continued fierce fighting at Tikhvin, Borisov, and Bobruisk. On other fronts, our army firmly defended the national defense line, defeating the enemy attempting to break into our country. (2) In the Tikhvin sector, the enemy attacked with large tank formations leading the way and motorized infantry bringing up the rear. Our army firmly defended the line, inflicting heavy damage on enemy tanks. The enemy then launched a second attack with reinforcements, and our army withdrew to a new line. (2) Important battles also occurred simultaneously in the Lepiel sector. Enemy tank attacks were all repelled by our army. In the afternoon, after fierce air force action, the enemy forced our army to move several kilometers eastward. (3) The battle on the Berezina River is continuing and is unfavorable to the enemy. The enemy repeatedly attempted to cross the river, but were repelled by our army. (4) There was intense fighting all day near Ternopol. Enemy mechanized units attempted to advance southeastward. Our army showed great courage and composure and finally defeated the enemy, who had superior numbers. (5) Our air force heavily bombed enemy airfields and mechanized units, preventing their advance and inflicting heavy damage on them. According to reliable statistics, our air force shot down 62 enemy aircraft yesterday.

### The Army Uses Scorched Earth Tactics and Abandoned Czernowitz

Havas, Rome, June 5th: The semi-official Stefani news agency issued a message stating that German and Romanian motorized units have today entered the city of Czernowitz, the capital of Bukovina province. Before retreating, the Red Army set the city on fire, turning it into ashes.

International News Service, Berlin, June 6th: It is reported here today that German armored divisions have reached the Dnieper River. The German High Command has not yet specified the exact position of the German army, but since the German army has reached the "Gateway to Smolensk," Moscow is clearly facing a first direct threat. The German command stated that the entire Red Army has been surrounded. The German army in the Baltic region participated in the battle and won, and is now cooperating with the Finnish army in the north to attack Leningrad. The German army in the south is reported to have crossed the Prut River and reached the Dnieper River in Bessarabia.

### Hungarian Army Continues to Advance Eastward, Finnish Army Occupies Soviet Islands

Reuters, London, June 6th: According to a German military communiqué, German forces have nearly reached the Dnieper River and are currently pursuing enemy forces in the Baltic States. The communiqué also stated that the Hungarian army has occupied Kolomyia and Stanislavov, located between Lemberg and Czernowitz.

International News Service, Stockholm, Sweden, June 6th: According to news from here today, after fierce fighting, the Finnish army has occupied several islands and defensive positions around the Soviet-held island of Hanko. The Finnish army quickly occupied the Åland Islands between Finland and Sweden, preventing the Soviet army from using them as a base of operations. These strategically important islands are now controlled by a large contingent of Finnish troops landing there.

### Nazi Mechanized Units Have Lost Five Out of Eight Divisions

United Press, London, June 6th: Military experts have carefully estimated that the momentum of the German army's attack has weakened. They say that the progress of the German mechanized units seems to be slower than what was stipulated in the German High Command's timetable for the invasion. As a result of the lengthening of transportation lines, the German army's advance may be even slower. It is reported that the vanguard of the German army has progressed from the German-Polish border to the pre-war Soviet territory east of Minsk, a distance of 320 miles by air. It is also reported that they have progressed another 60 miles to Bessarabia. Both German and Soviet communiqués indicate that both sides have suffered heavy casualties. It is said that Hitler sent eight mechanized divisions, totaling 80,000 men, in the first attack, while the Soviet side believes that at least five German mechanized divisions have been annihilated. It is generally believed that the Soviet army has resisted the Germans with eight armored divisions, and the Soviet army continues to claim that its main force has not yet engaged in combat.

### German War Report Claims 300,000 Soviet Soldiers Captured

Haitong News Agency, German Headquarters, June 6th: This afternoon's German war report stated that on the Eastern Front, the German army is advancing towards the Stalin Line according to plan. From June 22 to the 5th of this month, 300,000 Soviet soldiers have been captured. The German army continues to bomb enemy concentrations. In the Zhytomyr area, German aircraft destroyed 500 Soviet tanks and 18 trains. Last night, a heavy bombing raid was carried out on the Smarhon train interchange station. Yesterday, Soviet aircraft lost 281 planes, and German aircraft lost 11 planes. Yesterday, Soviet aircraft shot down 98 planes in aerial combat, and 183 planes were destroyed on the ground.

### Soviet Guerrillas Active Behind German-Occupied Areas

Reuters, Moscow, June 6th: The Soviet official TASS news agency said that Soviet guerrillas are extremely active in the German-occupied areas behind the front lines. These guerrillas are all familiar with the geography and have penetrated deep behind the enemy lines. The Germans are now rushing to repair roads and bridges destroyed by the Soviet army during the retreat. Due to the activities of the guerrillas, they have to send thousands of troops to guard them. The agency also said that the people of Romania under German occupation have now begun to openly rebel. Romanian patriots have recently clashed with German soldiers, and armed conflicts between the German and Romanian armies are gradually developing in many cities and towns in Romania. The German military command has issued a special order imposing severe penalties on those who engage in sabotage.

### Soviet Workers and Peasants Mobilize, Swearing Allegiance to the Country: Willing to Shed the Last Drop of Blood to Defend the Motherland, All Factories Throughout the Country Become Strong Fortresses

TASS, Moscow, June 6th: The whole of the Soviet Union is enthusiastically responding to Stalin's call to resolutely reorganize all work in accordance with wartime needs. The workers of Leningrad are preparing to inflict a decisive defeat on the enemy. Since Stalin's speech, hundreds of thousands of Leningrad residents have joined the National Guard. Workers and employees of the France Factory held a meeting, raised their hands, and swore to sacrifice themselves to defend the motherland. They have transformed the factory into an impregnable fortress, ready to strike a heavy blow against the enemy. Workers from the Kirov Factory who participated in the revolutionary war have joined the National Guard fighting on the front lines. The working masses of Ukraine also unanimously passed resolutions at meetings. They swore to Comrade Stalin that whether fighting on the front lines or working in the rear, they would defend the motherland with the last drop of blood. At the same time, they pointed out that they have fully understood the severity of the national crisis and are determined to guarantee victory on the front lines with all their strength. As for the collective farmers everywhere, they have also unanimously mobilized their great strength to fight a desperate battle against the fascists. In response to Stalin's call, the collective farmers of the Voronezh region have handed over the collective farms to the authorities and provided the country and the Red Army with agricultural products ahead of schedule. The authorities' orders are being implemented by the farmers. Some farmers have handed over more meat to the country than originally planned.

TASS, Moscow, June 6th: Zhutkov, Deputy Commissioner of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Agriculture, said, "At present, the patriotic sentiment in all rural areas is extremely high. Collective farmers are unanimously sending their sons to the army and carrying out rear-area work at the same time, hoping to achieve victory as soon as possible. The harvests in various places are currently excellent, and the farmers' organizations are also well-organized. They are all working hard to obtain abundant harvests ahead of schedule."

### Young Students' Deep Patriotic Sentiment

TASS, Moscow, June 6th: Moscow students are working hard to consolidate the front and the rear. Several male and female students from the Mining Institute are participating in the construction of Moscow's underground tunnels and are working as machinists. Countless female students at the school are currently studying medicine and nursing. First and second-year students from the Bauman Mechanical and Machine Building Institute are all working in shipyards. Students from the Stalin Railway Transportation Engineering Institute will replace those who have gone to the front as firefighters, and female students will serve as railway guards. Most of the students at the Engineering Institute are currently working in food factories and factories of the People's Commissariat for Food Industry. The fifth graduating class of the Second Medical Institute received their diplomas before the end of the semester and were sent to the front as military doctors, while the female students are all working as nurses in Moscow hospitals.

### Military-Civilian Cooperation to Strictly Guard Against Paratroopers

TASS, Moscow, June 6th: Patriotic people in areas close to the front lines are selflessly assisting the Red Army in arresting German paratroopers. When a certain city was subjected to an air raid at night, the people captured a German paratrooper, using flares as a marker to indicate the location of important military targets to enemy aircraft. Collective farmers watch the sky day and night on towers, and village children have set up observation posts to conceal the truth to prevent enemy paratroopers from landing.

TASS, Moscow, June 6th: Xenia, the son of the director of the Zhitomir hydroelectric station, encountered a visitor asking for directions to the gasoline station and railway station while sweeping the forest with several young engineers. Xenia told him the location of the Civil Defense Office. The paratrooper, unaware that he had been tricked, was unable to escape when he arrived there.

TASS, Moscow, June 6th: One night, several children caught sight of enemy planes circling over the forest, and soon four enemy paratroopers landed, asking the way to the city in clumsy Russian. The children gave them the wrong route and reported to the Red Army, who captured the four men.

### Economic Agreement Established Between Britain and the Soviet Union: Stipulating the Shipment of Malayan Rubber and Tin to the Soviet Union, Both Sides Also Seek Practical Military Cooperation

United Press, Washington, June 6th: Reliable sources here yesterday announced that Britain and the Soviet Union have virtually completed an economic agreement. The main points of the agreement are the shipment of large quantities of rubber from Malaya to the Soviet Union and the shipment of a small amount of tin produced in Malaya to the Soviet Union. Diplomatic sources here indicated that the Soviet Union is not entirely pleased with the form, extent, and speed of British-Soviet military cooperation. Moscow is gradually hoping for more active actions, the precise nature of which cannot be announced.

### Afghanistan Maintains Neutrality and Prepares to Deal with Contingencies

### British Foreign Secretary Reaffirms Determination to Fight to the End: The Sole Purpose is to Defeat Hitler, Willing to Provide Assistance to Those Who Share the Same Goals

Reuters, London, June 6th: Foreign Secretary Eden said today at an open-air rally in Leeds that, under no circumstances, are we prepared to negotiate with Hitler at any time or on any issue. We will intensify our war efforts until Hitler and what he stands for are completely overthrown. There is no room in the world for both Hitler and our way of life to coexist. We are willing to do our utmost to assist the Soviet Union and any people who resist Germany. We are determined to continue to build up our air power until we can defeat German air power on all battlefields. We will not be satisfied until then. Britain has only one goal, which is to break Hitler's tyranny so that all countries can work together to create a more secure and happier world based on peace and security.

### German Military Dictatorship Intensifies, Public Resentment Boils

Reuters, London, 6th: "The Times" editorial today stated that Hitler, failing to achieve his objectives in the Western campaign, abruptly changed course and risked an unnecessary attack on the Soviet Union. The reason for this is likely due to mental or physical weakness. Germany has now established a military dictatorship, with the Nazi leadership gradually fading away. Labor Front leader Dr. Ley has acknowledged the completion of his mission, Propaganda Minister Goebbels has been forced to express cooperation with the new organization, leaders of smaller parties are being purged, and Propaganda Department publishing director Bormann disappeared before the Three Powers Pact. Since the Deputy Führer's escape, the German secret police have conducted large-scale searches in northern Berlin, arresting mostly SA members in uniform. Hitler has now lost touch with the people, and officials seeking an audience for important matters must wait weeks to be seen. No one dares to tell Hitler that the people do not support him or that morale is low. When Hitler spoke to cheering factory workers, he was unaware that the audience consisted of junior party leaders brought in from other factories; the real factory workers were mostly on leave. Hess knew of public resentment more clearly than others, hence his attempt to entice the British into peace talks. Hess believed that if the Soviet Union rejected German demands, Germany would declare war on it. If Britain and the United States continued to prepare for war, Germany would be trapped within Soviet territory.

### Allied Forces Cross River, 10 Miles from Beirut, Aleppo Besieged on Three Sides, End of Syrian War Near

Reuters, London, 68th: According to reports from Jerusalem, Allied forces in Syria have crossed the Damour River, 10 miles south of Beirut, and occupied Lellif, 7 miles north of Jezzine. Simultaneously, a force from Palmyra is advancing towards Homs. An official announcement from Cairo stated that British aircraft bombed Vichy airfields and ships in Tripoli and Beirut. The British also bombed Benghazi and scattered a large formation of Italian fighters over Malta.

Reuters, Jerusalem, 6th: As a result of recent Allied operations, Aleppo is now besieged on three sides. A military spokesperson stated that the key town of Tel Kotchek on the northeastern Syrian border (where the railway to Iraq departs) is the headquarters of the Vichy forces on the Euphrates River and an important supply center. With the British capture of this town, they can now look westward towards Aleppo. The Allied forces on the road to Beirut are reported to have reached a point east of the main coastal position to protect their right flank. The Vichy forces' loss of three important towns indicates the Allied forces' continued advance and the Vichy forces' rapidly declining resistance.

United Press, Ankara, 6th: Authoritative neutral sources here declared today that discipline among Vichy troops in Syria has collapsed. Senegalese and Annamese troops in Beirut are reportedly completely out of control. Many authoritative sources believe that a ceasefire between Vichy and British/Free French forces is imminent.

Havas, Beirut, 5th: British aircraft bombed the area again today, dropping just over 50 bombs. A gas station was hit and caught fire, severely injuring one worker.

### RAF Attacks Germany, Weekly Results

Reuters, London, 6th: The characteristics of RAF activities during the week ending July 4th were the expansion of daylight raids on Germany. The Bremen and Kiel dockyards and railway yards south of Waldenburg were bombed with considerable success. Night raids were also effective. The Krupp factory in Essen was bombed and set on fire on the night of July 3rd. The Bremen industrial area was subjected to five night raids, resulting in heavy damage. In addition to attacking several naval and air bases, the RAF also raided Emden, Duisburg, and Cologne, as well as Hamburg, Wilhelmshaven, and Düsseldorf. The RAF confirmed the sinking of a 3,000-ton ship and the setting on fire of an 8,000-ton ship during this week. In addition, one 3,000-ton and one 6,000-ton ship are believed to have been sunk. The RAF shot down 55 enemy aircraft this week but lost 77 of its own, with two pilots rescued.

Reuters, London, 6th: RAF heavy bombers, escorted by a large number of fighters, raided important steel factories in Lille yesterday afternoon. Many bombs scored direct hits. The railway marshalling yards at Abbeville were also bombed by British aircraft.

Reuters, London, 6th: According to an Air Ministry communiqué, enemy aircraft briefly appeared over Britain on Friday night, with activity slightly greater than recently. Bombs were dropped in the Midlands and southwestern England, but the attacks were not significant. At least three German bombers were destroyed. A small group of German bombers made a brief, fierce attack on a British convoy in the English Channel. During the week ending the dawn of July 5th, enemy aircraft activity over Britain was slight. Five German aircraft were destroyed during this week, one on June 29th, one on July 3rd, and the other three on the night of July 4th. There were no British losses.

### East African Campaign Nears End

Reuters, Cairo, 6th: The East African campaign is nearing its end. British forces have captured more territory held by modern armies in six months than Italian forces captured from poorly equipped armies in 1935, more than doubling the amount. This victory might not have been achieved without the persistent resistance of the Abyssinians during the five years of Italian rule, helping Britain restore their freedom. Since South African troops and Abyssinian patriots entered Addis Ababa, fierce fighting has occurred southwest of the capital. Indian troops advanced south from Eritrea, forcing Italian forces to retreat into the mountains, attempting to implement instructions from Rome/Germany to tie down British forces in East Africa to prevent their deployment elsewhere. However, this hope was not realized.

### Britain and the US Fear German Use of French Territories, German Occupation Could Threaten US and British Security

United Press, New York, 6th: Both the United States and Britain fear that Franco-German collaboration will allow Germany to freely use French colonies for military operations. This would bring Germany closer to Dakar, only 1,600 miles from the nearest point in South America, and create difficulties for the British Mediterranean Fleet. If Germany occupies French territories, it would lead to air battles between British and German forces over French territory, and naval battles between the British and French navies. Admiral Cunningham, the British Mediterranean Fleet commander, currently controls Mediterranean sea lanes, but if the French fleet (including two battleships, one aircraft carrier, 14 cruisers, 53 destroyers, and 60 submarines) joins forces with the Italian fleet (including six battleships, 15 cruisers, 60 destroyers, and 80 submarines), the situation in the Mediterranean could change. Such a combined fleet could challenge the British fleet. Admiral Cunningham commands no more than seven battleships, two battlecruisers, two aircraft carriers, 15 cruisers, 50 destroyers, and 50 submarines. If the French fleet joins the Axis powers, their number of warships would exceed the British fleet. Furthermore, over 100 Axis torpedo boats in the Aegean Sea could attack the British. Therefore, if the French fleet shows signs of being used by the Axis, we hope Admiral Cunningham will preemptively destroy it to prevent its use by the Axis. Although French sailors may not want to obey Vichy orders and assist the Axis, German sailors could fill their roles. The United States is closely monitoring French territories in the Western Hemisphere and Dakar after Franco-German collaboration. US administrative officials fear that Germany will use South African ports to advance into South America. Recently, Congress was asked to grant the US and Britain the joint right to take over Dakar. This would naturally be an act of war, and the French fleet and Dakar would resist. However, if we use strong military force, even with the long distance from US naval bases, occupying the port would not be a problem. The United States could first occupy the Cape Verde Islands as a base to attack Dakar. The islands are only 3,000 miles from the United States (similar to the distance of the West Indies). If the US occupies Dakar, it would greatly assist the British Atlantic Fleet. When Britain engages in Atlantic naval battles with the Axis, the US fleet can fully assist British forces. However, if Germany occupies the Azores, it would be a significant threat to the United States. German occupation of the Azores would be like Japan occupying Honolulu and then attacking the US West Coast. Therefore, if the intent of Franco-German collaboration is for Germany to use French territories, the US must occupy Martinique Island because it is very close to the Panama Canal.

### US President Returns to Washington, Consults with Military and Political Leaders on National Defense and Diplomacy

United Press, Washington, 6th: President Roosevelt returned to Washington yesterday and immediately consulted with senior national defense and diplomatic advisors on military and aid-to-Britain programs.

### 318 Die During US Holiday Weekend

Reuters, New York, 6th: A total of 318 people died in accidents during the two-day US Independence Day holiday weekend.

### British Press Commentary on US President's Broadcast

Reuters, London, 6th: This morning's newspapers in London and elsewhere all used President Roosevelt's Independence Day broadcast as editorial material, stating that American freedom and world freedom are both threatened by Nazism. The Daily Mirror stated that this year's Independence Day celebration was overshadowed by a sense of impending crisis. This is why President Roosevelt warned that the fundamental principles of the 1776 Declaration are now being overthrown at home and threatened abroad. Former Republican presidential candidate Willkie, not bound by official responsibilities, spoke more freely than President Roosevelt. Willkie announced his belief that the US Navy would soon guarantee the safe delivery of supplies to Britain. The Times stated that the US President made it clear that American freedom, which created American independence, must coexist with the freedom of the world. There are few Americans who do not believe that their country is not significantly affected by the outcome of this war. The number of Americans who believe that the United States can avoid actively participating in preventing this outcome from harming freedom is dwindling. The wider the scope of the war, the greater American assistance will be.

Reuters, Edmonton, 6th: Canadian Prime Minister King, commenting on President Roosevelt's Independence Day broadcast, said, "This is a beautiful declaration of defending freedom. As President Roosevelt expressed in his heart, the United States is ready to do what is necessary to protect freedom."

### US Marines En Route to Britain All Rescued

Reuters, Washington, 6th: The New York Times Washington correspondent reported that Britain will purchase 20,000 bales of US cotton per month until 600,000 bales have been delivered. Britain has notified the US government that ships will be available immediately. This US cotton will be drawn from government-owned stocks and shipped under the Lend-Lease Act, not purchased on the market. It is heard here that Britain's need for other surplus US agricultural products is gradually increasing. It is expected that this will greatly reduce the stocks in US government warehouses.

### RAF Establishes Combat Record in Middle East, German Aircraft Attack British Convoy in Eastern Mediterranean

Reuters, London, 6th: In the week ending July 3rd, 39 enemy aircraft were destroyed in the Middle East, fewer than in previous weeks, while British aircraft losses were comparatively low, with only six failing to return. Tripoli and Benghazi on the North African coast were each bombed six times during this week. When British aircraft attacked Tripoli on June 30th, several enemy aircraft were hit, and a ship of approximately 20,000 tons was heavily damaged. British aircraft then strafed enemy soldiers leaving the ship and enemy aircraft on the water. On July 1st, British aircraft attacked Gazirak with incendiary bombs, causing fires that first burned in all directions and then spread everywhere. The fire could be seen 70 miles away. The Allied advance in Syria was also supported by the air force. Airfields in Aleppo and Palmyra, as well as shipyards and ships in Beirut, were repeatedly bombed. Eight Italian aircraft were shot down over and near Malta, with no British losses.

Havas, Berlin, 5th: The semi-official German News Agency (DNB) issued a report stating that after learning that several British merchant ships had arrived at Famagusta on the east coast of British-controlled Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean, German aircraft bombed the area. Military installations in the port were hit, and two merchant ships were damaged. All German aircraft safely returned to base afterwards.

Reuters, Manila, 6th: Customs authorities confirmed the detention of the Japanese ship Yojima Maru, stating that it will be released only after its cargo of military supplies has been unloaded here, or a guarantee is provided that it will be delivered to the US government. Delivery to the US government also requires approval from the US representative here. Representatives of Nippon Yusen Kaisha stated that the company guarantees to deliver the cargo according to the contract and plans to find a non-Japanese ship to transfer the cargo. Officials here stated that there is no question of confiscating the ship or sabotaging it; only the military supplies will not be allowed to be unloaded from the ship.

### Turkish Parliament Expresses Confidence in Government

Havas, Ankara, 5th: The National Assembly convened today. Prime Minister Saydam delivered a speech on Turkey's foreign policy. The Assembly then voted to pass a vote of confidence by a large majority of 209 to 19.

### European War Talk (6)(7) Gold and Diamond War Between Britain and Germany

Between Britain and Germany, there is currently what is called the Atlantic War, the Mediterranean War, the Near East War, the Sahara War in North Africa, and the Air War. However, in addition to these, there is also a diamond war unknown to the world.

Both Britain and Germany feel an urgent need for rough and fine diamonds and are now doing everything possible to control the European diamond industry. Industrial diamonds are essential for the manufacture of military equipment, and this need increases with the progress of the war. As for polished diamonds, they can be sold well in the United States, exchanged for large amounts of US dollars, because Americans' investment in diamonds has recently become a trend.

Before the war, the European diamond polishing industry was concentrated in Antwerp, Belgium, and Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Germany is now planning to revive and try to restore the two major diamond industry centers of Belgium and the Netherlands, supplemented by many small centers in Germany itself. At the same time, it intends to force merchants to sell rough diamonds to factories under German control for polishing, and to prevent skilled diamond polishers from fleeing to countries outside German control.

However, a large number of diamond polishers could not bear the pressure and had already crossed the English Channel to do business in London. International diamond trading is still based in London as the main market, and the London diamond industry has recently formed an exchange to facilitate local business.

The lack of skilled craftsmen is a major obstacle to the development of the British diamond industry. There are only 150 such craftsmen in Britain today, while Antwerp had 30,000 before the war. However, Britain has established a new factory, and the future is optimistic.

All the world's diamond producing areas are in the hands of Britain. The value of diamonds is invaluable, making them a treasure, which is also the result of Britain's independent management. In ancient times, only the vaults of monarchs and Indian emperors contained this gem. It was not until the 15th century that Charles VII of France's mistress, Salier, first flaunted diamond jewelry, and people began to realize that diamonds could be used for women's decorations. At that time, the only place where diamonds were produced was India, and the supply was scarce. In the early 18th century, diamonds were also discovered in Brazil, but the quantity was small and not enough to cause a sensation.

The world of diamonds was shaken when diamond mines were discovered in South Africa. In 1867, a boy named Jacob in Kimberley, South Africa, found a shiny stone by the river and took it home to play with. A sharp-eyed neighbor saw it and managed to trick the child's mother into giving it to him (she had no idea of the value of the item) and sold it to an Irish peddler for a small price. That peddler then sold it to South African Governor Rhodes for US$2,500. Since then, South Africa's reputation for producing large diamonds has spread far and wide. Jacob, who discovered the diamond, died in 1933 at the age of 72, and although he lived a life of poverty, he did not regret it.

Until then, all diamonds were picked up in alluvial areas. After the discovery of South African diamond deposits, it became possible to extract them by mining. Britons traveled from afar to mine diamonds. Governor Rhodes took the preemptive strike and founded De Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd., and after a series of mergers, he controlled all of South African diamond production. Today, the company produces 95% of the world's total diamond production. Diamonds are regarded as luxury ornaments for no other reason than their monopoly.

If Britain were willing, it could make diamonds universal in the world by simply stepping up mining. The reason why Britain is unwilling to do this is simply because once diamonds are commonplace, they will no longer be rare treasures, and their value will inevitably plummet. In this way, Britain would lose its money-spinner, and the diamond industry would be in danger of disintegrating. What is there for the wealthy and shrewd British to benefit from this?

Under Britain's strict control, foreign importers must be at their mercy to request to purchase rough diamonds. Importers must undergo appropriate investigations and be qualified before being allowed to view the goods. The diamond trading company's showroom hosts the viewing ceremony every few months. When the showroom is open, rough, small diamonds are arranged on the tables according to their shape and size. Each row has about six to twelve diamonds. If a buyer likes a diamond on a certain shelf and wants to own it, he must not only buy the remaining stones on the shelf but also buy the entire row, otherwise the transaction is difficult to complete. Buyers have no right to argue about the price, and all prices have been determined in advance. They simply have to pay the full amount. The company's big-bellied executives are aloof, with iron faces and very arrogant expressions. Buyers can only be humble and submissive. The company always maintains a stock of £2 million. After each viewing, it sells a certain amount and then mines a certain amount to fill the gap.

Hitler, filled with illusions, may want to acquire large quantities of余剛 diamond. However, his purpose is not to collect diamond ornaments, but to need industrial diamonds for non-decorative purposes. Since the last European war, various industries have competed to use alloys with high hardness for manufacturing purposes.余剛 diamond's hardness is higher than everything else (five or six times harder than the hardest emery), so it is indispensable for the machines that manufacture mechanized weapons. The so-called intensity here refers to the degree of resistance to abrasion. The surface of diamonds also has wood-like grains and is very brittle. An ordinary hammer is enough to crush it.

### Strict Security Measures in Both Concessions Today; Shanghai Citizens Encouraged and Vigilant, Voluntarily Ceasing Entertainment and Practicing Thrift; Checks Implemented at All Intersections

Today, to express remembrance and encouragement, all sectors have unanimously ceased eating meat for one day. Many entertainment venues and radio stations have also voluntarily suspended entertainment programs. Authorities in both concessions are implementing particularly strict security measures today for prevention and are strictly enforcing curfews to maintain order. Details are as follows:

Concessions Implement Joint Defense Security

The Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession Municipal Council's police authorities are taking measures today to prevent undesirable elements from taking advantage of the situation to disrupt public order, endanger public safety, and local peace. In addition to stepping up security measures in advance (including a ban on gatherings, associations, parades, demonstrations, and other activities), they are also strictly enforcing curfew laws. Starting at 5:00 AM yesterday, joint defense security measures were implemented. All police personnel were mobilized, and there were double patrols on all roads. The defense forces and business associations assisted in their respective jurisdictions to supplement the police force. Armored vehicles, police vehicles, patrol teams, and male and female inspection teams also patrolled and conducted searches and inspections.

Enduring Hardship, Firm Resolve

All sectors of the city believe that with the war situation increasingly favorable over the past four years, their future responsibilities are becoming more significant. Therefore, they encourage each other to endure hardships and difficulties that ordinary people cannot bear. Thoughts and actions must be coordinated, and they must strengthen their resolve and cultivate their integrity. Furthermore, they must crack down on hoarding of food and manipulation of prices, break selfish and self-interested schemes and illegal speculative activities, promote economic construction, practice thrift and savings, eliminate bad habits, prohibit luxury and vanity, and reduce living standards, dedicating the money saved to the country. Various organizations have also sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to express their respect.

### North China Adds Place Name Stamps, Not Allowed for Use

The post offices in the five districts of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Northern Jiangsu have recently noted the significant difference in remittance rates between these areas and Shanghai. Therefore, starting a month ago, they have affixed the names of the respective districts to all stamps within these five districts. This has been implemented since the first of this month. Stamps without place names will be rejected for circulation. However, these stamps with place names added in North China will reportedly not be accepted for general use by the Shanghai Post Office when they are transported to Shanghai from North China in the future. Anyone using them will be penalized and required to pay the difference.

### Grain Depot Employees' Slowdown Affects People's Food Supply; Parties Negotiate Day and Night, Hoping to Break the Deadlock Soon

Since the union of workers at bean, rice, and miscellaneous grain depots began a slowdown due to unmet wage increase demands, more than 20,000 workers, including those in upper-level depots, shipping, loading and unloading, barging, trucking, and carting at various wharves, warehouses, and depots, have been affected and unable to continue working due to the depot slowdown and the lack of goods to load and unload. If the labor unrest continues unresolved, there is considerable concern that it will affect the people's food supply. It is understood that more than 20,000 loading and unloading barge, truck, and other wharf laborers are planning to petition the Public Works Department and the bean and rice trade associations in the coming days for their livelihoods and to express their sympathy for the depots, requesting that they approve the demands made by the depots. The employers once requested that the workers resume work immediately from today and then engage in sincere negotiations, but the workers did not agree. Currently, all parties are negotiating day and night because the workers are demanding a sevenfold increase in wages, which the employers must carefully consider.

Rice Prices Likely to Decline

More than sixteen bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai last weekend and were being unloaded yesterday. The arrival of this large amount of foreign rice proves that the rumors spread by speculators last week, claiming that the city's food supply was facing difficulties, are completely untrue. As a result, rice prices this week are likely to decline due to the significant increase in inventory.

Miscellaneous Grain Merchants Have No Sales Channels

Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the large quantities of peanuts, beans, oils, and other miscellaneous grains purchased by Japanese merchants in Nanshi have been unable to be transported to Germany, and there are no major sales channels in the city. This has caused the prices of various miscellaneous grains to plummet. According to past practice, the prices of miscellaneous grains usually fluctuate with the rise and fall of rice prices, but last week the prices of miscellaneous grains actually declined. It is predicted that the decline will be even more severe in the future.

### Water and Electricity Price Hikes Implemented Starting This Month; Surcharge Exchange Rate Officially Set; Gas Usage Limited, Fees Increased for Exceeding Limit

The Shanghai Power Company, the Shanghai Waterworks Company, and the Shanghai Gas Company in the International Settlement previously requested the approval of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department to appropriately increase monthly fees due to high expenses. The Board of Directors of the Public Works Department then referred the case to the Public Utilities Committee for discussion and decision on measures to increase water and electricity fees and limit gas consumption. It is understood that these new price increase measures will be officially implemented from the first of this month. The electricity fee will be increased by a "temporary" surcharge of 50% of the basic electricity fee. The calculation of this surcharge will be based on an exchange rate of 5.25 yuan to 100 national currency. The water surcharge will be increased from 110% to 250%. Gas usage will be limited. The monthly gas consumption of any user must not exceed the consumption in the same period last year. If this is not possible, it is limited to the consumption in the previous period of this year. If this is still not possible, it will be based on a reasonable quantity estimated by the company. Fees will be significantly increased for exceeding the limit. The above fee increase measures will be implemented from this month. The citizens of the city will bear another heavy burden.

### German Goods Already Purchased by Chinese Merchants Planned to be Transported Internally via Wenzhou; Hoping Medicines and Dyes Will Be Approved for Domestic Sale; If Allowed, Sales Permits Will Be Issued

The North China Daily News reports that reliable sources stated yesterday (the 5th) that Shanghai Chinese merchants purchased a significant amount of German goods before the Central Government severed diplomatic relations with Berlin. In addition to selling them in the city, they are also seeking alternative outlets. Therefore, they plan to apply to the government for permission to sell these German goods in the areas controlled by the National Government. Although it is currently impossible to transport the goods into Free China, the Chinese merchants believe that once Wenzhou is open to navigation, they will be able to transport the goods there. German goods have not been transported inland via Hong Kong and Rangoon for some time. The goods of Chinese merchants here are transported internally via Ningbo and Wenzhou. Now that Ningbo has become an occupied area, the Chinese merchants consider Wenzhou to be the only port through which these goods can be transported internally.

Wenzhou was captured by the Chinese army at the beginning of the war in eastern Zhejiang. However, the military authorities still prohibit Shanghai ships from sailing to the coastal area. Chinese sources here believe that since Chongqing has severed diplomatic relations with Berlin, it will certainly boycott German goods. However, before this new development, Chongqing allowed German medicines and dyes to be sold inland because they were not considered imported luxury goods. It is reported that Shanghai Chinese merchants currently have a large quantity of German medicines and dyes that they urgently want to transport and sell inland. It is also rumored that German firms have these goods stored in warehouses in the city. Shanghai Chinese merchants only hope that the government will allow the sale of these two types of German goods that were purchased or ordered before the severance of relations. If the government grants permission, it will send personnel to consult with the Chinese merchants in order to issue sales permits.

### Silk Cocoons Cannot Be Transported to Shanghai, Manufacturers Despair; Silk Reeling Machines Have Been Dismantled Successively, Converting to Other Industries and Businesses

After the spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces entered the market, the Sino-Japanese Silk Company monopolized the purchase. Shanghai silk manufacturers and other cocoon merchants were not allowed to purchase freely. As a result, the plans of silk factories in the Shanghai concession area to start production after the spring cocoons entered the market have completely failed. Although requests were made to allow (1) the inland spring cocoons to be transported to Shanghai for silk reeling by the factories, and (2) the inland native silk factories to transport silk to Shanghai for export or supply to silk mills in order to maintain the merchants' business, reporters learned from the silk cocoon industry that because the Sino-Japanese Company has monopolized and controlled the silk industry, inland silk cocoons still cannot be freely transported to Shanghai. Shanghai silk factories have been forced to completely shut down due to the depletion of raw materials. Moreover, some silk factories dismantled their silk reeling machines last year and converted them into other factories. The silk businesses that deal in native silk have no business to speak of because the Shanghai silk factories have shut down, their silk stocks have been sold out, and the inland family silk factories and native silk cannot be transported to Shanghai. As for the native silk brought into Shanghai from the inland areas by silkworm farmers, the quantity is small. Therefore, the entire Chinese silk cocoon industry in Shanghai has lost hope.

### US Investment in China; Recent Figures Reach $400 Million; Tripled in Ten Years

According to recent statistics from foreign sources, the investment of the US government and people in China has increased rapidly in recent years, reaching $412 million (excluding the three northeastern provinces). This includes business investment of $202 million, church property in China of $40 million, and loans since the start of the war of resistance of $170 million. The above figures include the 1931 wheat loan of $9,212,000, the 1932 cotton and wheat loan of $17,105,000, and the Sino-American Aviation Company of $4 million. In addition, the stock held by the US in various important enterprises in Shanghai has reached $120 million. Comparing the total US investment in China mentioned above with the total US investment in China up to 1930, which was $155,112,778, as investigated by Professor Remer of the University of Michigan in 1933, it can be seen that in the recent ten years, the amount of US investment in China has increased nearly threefold.

### Tianyi Pavilion Library Collection in Ningbo Moved to Southern Zhejiang; Japanese Searches Unsuccessful

According to reliable sources, all the books in the Fan family's Tianyi Pavilion in Ningbo were moved by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education to a safe area in southern Zhejiang in October of the 29th year. After the Japanese army invaded Ningbo, Makida Teiryo, a Japanese cultural worker, went to Tianyi Pavilion to inquire about the collection. Fortunately, the books had been moved earlier, otherwise they would have been looted.

### Residence of British Bishop in Lanzhou Bombed to Ashes

A delayed dispatch from the North China Daily News in Xi'an, dated June 1st: Since the Japanese army invaded Zhongtiao Mountain, Japanese troops have been appearing in various places near the Yellow River. However, one key point on the north bank is still firmly defended by the Chinese army, and the Japanese army has been unable to seize it. Therefore, they are carrying out extensive bombing of various sections of the Longhai Railway, causing damage to transportation. Trains are sometimes strafed by machine guns. As a result, it took a certain Westerner four days to travel from Luoyang to Tongguan. After the frenzied bombing of Luoyang, a quarter of the houses have been destroyed. Shanxi Province is also being bombed daily, and Lanzhou is being bombed three times a day. The magnificent Xi'an Railway Station has also been partially destroyed. The streets and houses in the eastern suburbs of the city have been completely razed. The residence of Bishop Ruchill, the secretary of the English Missionary Society, happened to be located there. When the Japanese aircraft dropped bombs that day, he, his wife, and Miss Wellington immediately crouched down at the gate of their house. However, when they got up, they found that their residence had been reduced to a pile of rubble. In order to ensure the safety of the people, the government authorities had to strictly implement the plan to evacuate the residents of the city. For example, haircuts could not be done during the day and had to be done in secret locations. It is reported that the Eighth Route Army is now under orders to launch a counter-offensive in the Japanese rear.

### Loud Explosion on Western Railway This Morning; Believed to Be a Landmine

At 1:10 AM this morning, a loud explosion occurred near the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway in Fahua Town, Shanghai's western district, shaking the surrounding area. It is said that it was a landmine or a large time bomb that exploded.

### Suspension of Foreign Exchange Arbitrage Transactions; Restrictions on Forward Trading; Fox and Shanghai Financial Community Reach Agreement; Implemented Immediately to Maintain Exchange Rates

After arriving in Shanghai on the 25th of last month from Chongqing, Fox, the American member of the Chinese Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, and his assistant Taylor, examined the monetary and financial situation in Shanghai and the occupied areas, as well as black market exchange rate issues. Now that Fox's mission has been completed, he is preparing a detailed report and will soon return to Chongqing to report on his mission. It is reported that regarding Shanghai, after a review by various economic experts, maintaining the black market exchange rate should be done in close cooperation with various friendly banks to adopt effective measures to crack down on black market speculation and arbitrage in order to maintain the business of legitimate merchants. It is now reported that various friendly banks (referring to British and American banks) and various Chinese banks engaged in foreign exchange have reached an agreement to restrict forward foreign exchange trading and suspend arbitrage transactions from today onwards, with the aim of curbing the illegal activities of speculators in the market and enabling the black market exchange rate to be sustained under the maintenance of the Stabilization Fund Committee.

### British Aid China Committee Eager for China to Win Yesterday; Issues Commemorative Declaration and Intensifies Aid

Four years ago today, the Lugouqiao Incident suddenly occurred. The entire country regarded this incident as the prelude to China's war for freedom and independence, and rose up with great enthusiasm to make every effort. Over the past four years, it has become stronger and stronger, its morale is high, and victory is in sight. During this commemorative period, everyone will continue with an ardent and loyal spirit to welcome the coming of the fifth glorious year of the war. The keen expectations and assistance of friendly countries towards China will surely strengthen China's great cause of persevering to the end and completing the construction of the country. Now that the full-scale war has entered a new stage, although it will encounter even greater difficulties than before, the favorable international political situation, the increasing assistance from friendly countries, and China's own progress are enough to form greater strength to overcome even greater difficulties. The future is bright, and the reconstruction and revitalization of the country are at hand. The people of the country should be vigilant and exert themselves, determined to move forward and promote its success.

Intensified Aid to China, Declaration Issued

To commemorate China's four years of struggle in the war, the British Aid China Committee has issued a declaration in newspapers across the country, appealing for China. The declaration is signed by Lord Lisdowell, the chairman of the committee, Chairman Colance, Vice-Chairman Ms. Fairley, and Honorary Secretary Ms. Woodman. The original text is as follows: "Today marks the beginning of the fifth anniversary of China's struggle for freedom and independence. We are now planning to raise a special fund to be remitted to China today. But we must also plan to continue serving China in Britain. The biggest problem with democracy is ignorance and misjudgment. When Japan invaded, China was materially unprepared, and the Western people were unaware of the significance of the events in the Far East and the influence of their governments. Eliminating ignorance and promoting a practical policy of aiding China is the responsibility of this committee. Last year, the committee's offices were frequently bombed, and although funds have been exhausted, we continue to maintain this important work, collecting information and special articles for newspapers, organizing lectures, and engaging in publicity. Even at this time, we dare not stop our activities, because we firmly believe that this action is the prelude to the future friendship between the two great nations of China and Britain."

Appealing to All Parties for Enthusiastic Support

The British Aid China Committee has decided to expand the All-British Aid China Movement from today onwards. In addition to specially inviting Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to Britain, and Ambassadors Winant of the United States and Maisky of the Soviet Union to participate in the "One Bowl of Rice" Committee and deliver speeches on the spot, it will also jointly publish commemorative special editions with various newspapers, distribute hundreds of thousands of copies of the booklet "Four Years of Resistance," raise 1,000 pounds for relief donations, hold essay competitions for schoolchildren on aid to China, encourage pastors and church members to donate in churches, and establish commemorative industrial institutions for aid to China. All of these reflect the sincere enthusiasm of Britain's aid to China. In addition, the British Broadcasting Corporation in London will dedicate a Chinese language program in its overseas broadcasting time today to broadcast the Chinese national anthem, marches, news, and telegrams from Chinese and British celebrities to the Aid China Committee. Mr. Gu Weijun will also broadcast a speech to the British people on the radio station. The time is 12:30 to 12:40 noon London time, and 8:30 to 8:40 PM Shanghai time. The radio station's wavelength is 16.86 and the frequency is 17790 kHz.

### Coal Ball Retailers' Price Decline in Some Areas

According to news from shipping circles yesterday, the British merchant ship Xiangtai arrived from North China the day before yesterday with 3,000 tons of coal, and the unloading was completed yesterday. The ship will sail to North China today to continue transporting coal to Shanghai. It is also learned that the coal ball market is facing practical difficulties due to the glut of spot goods and the sluggish trading during this summer season. Those holding warehouse receipts are selling off in large quantities, causing the price per ton to fall by six or seven yuan. However, the wholesale prices of various coal ball factories remain unchanged. Retail prices have been reduced from 16 yuan to more than 15 yuan per dan in some areas. Therefore, it is generally believed that coal ball factories should reduce factory prices according to market demand in a situation of oversupply.

### Solar Flare Sunspots Affect the Weather; Radio Communication Obstructed; European and American Radio Telegrams Difficult to Receive; Observatory Says There May Be Other Reasons

According to the English Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, world-renowned astronomers have recently predicted that large sunspots will appear on the sun, disrupting the weather and severely obstructing radio transmission and reception. This prediction was realized today (the 6th) for two days, because all news agencies in the city have not received radio telegrams from Europe and the Americas. This situation may continue for several hours or even several days, and it is impossible to determine.

Difficult to Listen

According to the China Press, radio communications between Shanghai and Europe and the Americas were disrupted yesterday (the 5th) due to weather conditions, causing Shanghai newspaper editors and radio station news reporters to struggle to find suitable news to meet public needs last night. Since 6:00 AM yesterday, Shanghai news agencies have felt that news of the war and other events was extremely scarce.

Better at Night

In the afternoon, a few wire telegrams and a small number of radio telegrams from the Far East began to arrive. The Shanghai Democratic Radio Station (call sign XCDN), which usually rebroadcasts news reports and current affairs talks from the BBC in London every night, was also affected and unable to rebroadcast. It was not until 11:30 PM that various news agencies regained radio contact with Moscow, London, and other centers, and various important news items arrived one after another.

Other Reasons

The weather has been bad for days, and the Pacific Chinese winds have been blowing, making the traffic of ships between Hong Kong and Shanghai difficult. The weather in the city suddenly became hot yesterday morning, the hottest it has been all summer. It is rumored that this was caused by the bad weather, but according to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency who inquired at the Xujiahui Observatory, there have been no changes in the weather in recent days. This disruption of telecommunications is not related to the weather. The rumor that it was caused by bad weather is not true. There may be other reasons, which are also unknown.

### British Steel Car Factory in Zhabei Suddenly Attacked at Night; Russian Guards Shot, One Killed, Two Wounded; More Than 20 Armed Individuals, Bizarre Case

At around 0:30 AM yesterday morning, a large group of armed individuals suddenly stormed into a steel car factory on Guangfu Road in Zhabei, killing one Russian guard and seriously wounding two others on the spot. The details of the case are as follows:

Strange Men Suddenly Arrive at Russian Guard Post

The British-owned China Steel Car Factory on Guangfu Road in Zhabei has been operating for many years. Because it was Saturday the day before yesterday, the factory was closed and all the staff left the factory. Therefore, there were only three Russian guards stationed at the factory. Unexpectedly, at 0:30 AM yesterday morning, in the middle of the night, a large group of men, about twenty, armed with guns, suddenly arrived at the factory and rushed into the factory. One of the three Russian guards on duty tried to stop them. Because the two sides could not understand each other, a dispute immediately broke out.

Gunfire, One Killed, Two Wounded

The sound alerted the other three Russian guards, who also came out to stop them from entering the factory. Unexpectedly, the men seemed impatient and raised their guns to attack the three Russian guards. The three guards were caught off guard and unable to defend themselves, and were shot down one after another. One guard died instantly from a chest wound. Seeing that a fatal case had occurred, the large group of armed men retreated and fled without a trace. After the incident, the two wounded guards were sent to the hospital for treatment. The factory authorities also received the news and reported it to the police, who sent people to investigate. The detailed circumstances of the case, the identity of the armed men, and the motive for the attack are still unknown.

### Japanese Personnel Search Residences on Haig Road

### The Role of the Stabilization Fund

— Sun Liyu

Mr. Sun is likely familiar to readers, as he serves not only in the Central Bank but also as a professor at Jinan University and the head of the Banking Department at the National Business College. In this intense heat, he responded to the needs of this publication by analyzing the issue of the application of the stabilization fund. Since the arrival in Shanghai of the American stabilization commissioner Mr. Fox, this issue has drawn considerable attention from all parties. Given Mr. Sun's knowledge and professional environment, his views are certainly worthy of attention. At a time when rumors are rife, this article may serve as a refreshing tonic. (Editor)

Recently, Mr. Fox, the American commissioner of the Stabilization Fund Committee, accompanied by his assistant, Mr. Taylor, came to Shanghai on a mission to investigate the financial situation in Shanghai and its relationship with the interior. This is to serve as reference material for the application of the fund. As a result, speculators took the opportunity to spread rumors, and sweet words abounded, with some saying that the Stabilization Committee would stop supporting the Shanghai black market. Coupled with Germany and Italy's severance of relations with the Chinese government, the foreign exchange market on July 4th suddenly experienced a contraction unseen in months. The US dollar fell from 5.40625 yuan to 5.28125 yuan, a contraction of 0.125 yuan. This situation shows a general lack of understanding of the Stabilization Fund, which urgently needs to be corrected.

The purpose of the Stabilization Fund is to stabilize the foreign exchange rate after abandoning the gold standard. If the domestic currency is cheap and foreign exchange is expensive, the fund will sell foreign exchange and absorb domestic currency. Conversely, if the domestic currency is expensive and foreign exchange is cheap, the fund will purchase as much foreign exchange as possible and release domestic currency. In this way, the two currencies can be stabilized at a certain exchange rate. The principle is no more mysterious than that of an ever-normal granary. However, because both are currencies, people often confuse the two.

### The Stabilization Systems of the UK, US, and France

The Stabilization Fund originated in the UK. After the UK abandoned the gold standard in September 1931, the currency was decoupled from gold, and its foreign exchange rate had unlimited volatility, which was extremely detrimental to trade. The National Government was established, the Labor Party's power was ousted, and the Conservative Party's Chamberlain served as Chancellor of the Exchequer, making every effort to eliminate the deficit finance. The 1932 budget was able to maintain a balance, and the funds that had fled abroad and the hot money from countries with financial instability flocked back, resulting in a sudden surplus of hot money in the London foreign exchange market. At that time, the pound had already fallen by 35% compared to the gold standard era, which was extremely beneficial to export trade. However, the return of domestic capital and the influx of foreign hot money caused the market's supply of foreign exchange to exceed demand, and the pound was becoming increasingly expensive. The British financial authorities deeply felt that the increase in the external value of the pound would reduce the benefits of abandoning the gold standard, and that the mobility of hot money was extremely high. Once the UK experienced a crisis, when the hot money fled again, it would cause the pound's foreign exchange rate to plummet, and they would relive the bitter taste of the financial panic of September 1931. Therefore, the 1932 Finance Act stipulated the creation of the Stabilization Fund, which would use a large fund to stabilize the pound's foreign exchange rate, so as to eliminate undue fluctuations. However, according to the situation at the time of the establishment of the fund, the purpose of the fund was not to maintain the existing value of the pound, but to eliminate the state of excess supply of foreign exchange in the London market and suppress the rise of the pound. Therefore, what the fund needed was not foreign exchange, but pounds. The British Treasury issued treasury bills based on the above-mentioned Finance Act, exchanged them for pounds at the Bank of England or in the market, and then used them to purchase foreign exchange, suppressing the pound's price. At the same time, because London was the world's financial market and the amount of hot money moving was huge, the total amount of the fund was also large. When it was first established in 1932, it was £175 million. In June 1933, it was increased by £200 million, and in June 1937, it was increased again by £200 million, reaching a total of £575 million. The use of this fund has been very effective in stabilizing the pound's price. It only stopped its activities in the free market when the European war broke out and the UK implemented foreign exchange controls.

In addition, the US and France also had similar funds established. After the US stopped the gold standard in March 1933, the dollar gradually depreciated. In January 1934, the gold reserve system was established, and the price of the dollar against gold was reduced from $20.67 per ounce to $35 per ounce. From the profit of $2.8 billion obtained from revaluing the gold reserves, $2 billion was specifically allocated to establish a Stabilization Fund to stabilize the exchange rate of the dollar. At that time, the dollar had an upward trend against foreign currencies, so the role of the US Stabilization Fund was similar to that of the UK, specializing in suppressing the rise of the dollar. The situation in France was different. In May 1936, the Socialist Blum cabinet was established, the political situation was unstable, and hot money fled. The French franc could not maintain its external exchange rate, so in October, a new currency law was implemented, reducing the fineness of the franc and suspending its convertibility. At the same time, in order to maintain the exchange rate of the new franc, 10 billion francs were also withdrawn from the cash reserve valuation profit to establish a Stabilization Fund. However, France's fiscal revenue and expenditure could not be balanced, and a large number of funds fled, so the use of its fund was not like that of the UK and the US to suppress the rise of the domestic currency, but to maintain the existing external value of the franc. In its application process, it first sold the gold owned by the fund in London or New York, exchanged it for foreign exchange, and then the Bank of France sold foreign exchange without limitation to maintain the value of the franc.

Looking at the Stabilization Funds of the above three countries, although their effects are different, their role in stabilizing the foreign exchange rate of the domestic currency in the free market is completely consistent. In other words, the Stabilization Fund is only applicable to places with free foreign exchange. If foreign exchange has been managed and the exchange rate has been officially fixed, its buying and selling must go through government approval procedures and is not supplied without limitation. Then, there is no fluctuation in the exchange rate at all, and there is no need for stabilization. Therefore, countries such as Germany, Japan, and Italy, although they have abandoned the gold standard, have not established Stabilization Funds. However, countries that manage foreign exchange have fewer opportunities to convert their currency into foreign exchange than those that trade freely. Although they can barely maintain their value within their control areas, they inevitably have a black market and depreciate in places that are not controlled. Just look at the German blocked mark and the Japanese yen circulating abroad, which are exchanged for foreign currencies at a lower rate than the official exchange rate, and you can see their weakness.

### The Background of China's Stabilization System

Since the outbreak of the war in China, there was initially no restriction on the buying and selling of foreign exchange, maintaining the exchange rate of the legal currency at one shilling and two and a half pence against the British pound and 30 yuan against the US dollar. When the government controlled foreign exchange in March 1938 and applied the application system, a black market began to appear in Shanghai. However, Shanghai's situation was special. Even after the National Army withdrew to the west, its impact on the financial and material prices in the interior was still extremely large. The sharp contraction of the Shanghai exchange rate was enough to promote the soaring of material prices in the interior. In addition, Shanghai's international commercial relations were intricate and complex, and the legitimate interests of friendly merchants relied heavily on the stability of the exchange rate. Therefore, even under the unfavorable situation of being arbitrage, the government had to maintain the Shanghai black market. In March 1939, the Sino-British Exchange Stabilization Fund was established, with each of the Chinese and British banks contributing £5 million to maintain the exchange rate of the Shanghai black market. However, at that time, due to the imbalance of wartime finance, the loss of arbitrage, the escape of funds, and the small amount of the fund, it ultimately failed. Moreover, some commentators believed that borrowing money to help thieves and encourage the escape of funds was extremely unwise and should be abandoned immediately to preserve foreign exchange. Given the huge loss of foreign exchange and the sharp contraction at that time, this argument seemed to have great merit.

However, in September of the same year, the European war broke out, capital fled back, and foreign exchange lengthened. If the Shanghai exchange market was not stabilized, the fluctuations would affect material prices and trade considerably. Moreover, at that time, the stabilization effect was mostly to absorb foreign exchange and release legal currency, which was not only harmless to the national interest, but also consistent with its wartime economic policy. This was the era when the Stabilization Fund was effective. Since then, the international situation has been uncertain, and the exchange rate has repeatedly fluctuated, not like the straight line contraction of the past, so the fund has also been able to fulfill its stabilization function.

However, the amount of the Sino-British Stabilization Fund was extremely small, and it was consumed a lot. In the process of stabilizing the exchange rate, there was often a feeling of insufficient strength. Last November, the United States announced a loan of $50 million to China for the Stabilization Fund, and the United Kingdom also loaned £5 million. The Chinese government bank also allocated $20 million. The Sino-British-American Stabilization Fund was officially established this year. The total amount of this decision fund reached more than $90 million, which is much stronger than the previous decision!

Those who advocated abandoning the Shanghai black market in the past believed that this fund should not be used in Shanghai, but to benefit others by arbitrage. It should be allocated as an inland commercial exchange fund to purchase military supplies from abroad. The market also believed that the government would take this kind of measure, so every time rumors spread, foreign exchange contracted repeatedly. However, if we carefully examine the nature of the exchange stabilization fund, the process of British and American loans, the impact of the Shanghai exchange rate on the material prices in the interior, as well as the extent of Japanese arbitrage and the consequences of not maintaining it, we will know that abandoning the Shanghai black market is not allowed by the facts.

(1) First, judging from the nature of the Stabilization Fund, according to the precedents of the Stabilization Funds in the UK, the US, and France mentioned above, the fund is only used in the free market. If foreign exchange has been controlled and the exchange rate has been set, then there is no fluctuation in the exchange rate, and there is naturally no need for stabilization. The exchange rate in the interior of China has long been controlled. The Central Bank and the Bank of China sell foreign exchange to merchants for legitimate needs based on the benchmark of four and a half pence set by the government. Even if the fund is moved to the interior now, it will not be able to exert its stabilization function. Therefore, the fund will definitely be used in Shanghai.

(2) Secondly, judging from the process of British and American loans, in addition to the British and American announcements of exchange stabilization fund loans, there are also equivalent purchase loans. That is, when the interior needs military supplies, this loan can be used to purchase from the UK and the US. Since foreign military supplies purchased in the interior are purchased with special funds, it is clear that the Stabilization Fund is completely used to stabilize the Shanghai foreign exchange black market. Moreover, the reason why friendly countries are helping China is mostly to maintain their commercial interests in China, and commercial interests in China are mostly concentrated in Shanghai. If the government abandons the Shanghai black market, and Japan controls trade and foreign exchange, then the commercial foundation that friendly merchants have worked hard to build for a century will be completely lost. This is not the original intention of the lending country!

(3) Thirdly, judging from the relationship between the Shanghai exchange rate and the material prices in the interior, since Japan blockaded the coastal ports and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the Shanghai goods that are openly transported into the interior rely only on the Yunnan-Burma Road, which is very small in number and has little impact. However, in fact, the number of Shanghai goods smuggled into the interior through the occupied areas and ports is ten times the number of imports on the Yunnan-Burma Road. Therefore, the rise and fall of the Shanghai exchange rate, and the rise and fall of material prices that follow, are still enough to dominate the material prices in the interior. The high soaring of material prices in the interior has now become the most serious problem. If the Shanghai market is abandoned and allowed to contract sharply, the history of material prices in the interior will be unimaginable, and the impact of this will lead to increased budgets and paper money inflation, which will be a fatal injury to the wartime economy. Therefore, judging from the situation of material prices in the interior, maintaining the Shanghai exchange market is also a last resort. Some say that the fund should be moved to the interior to create a free exchange market in Chongqing or Kunming, and foreign exchange should be bought and sold without limitation. Even if the Shanghai exchange market is abandoned, material prices in the interior can still be maintained. However, reviewing the economic situation in the interior reveals that the crux of the material price problem lies not in the contraction of the exchange rate, but in the lack of materials. The lack of materials is due to the difficulty of transportation. If the transportation problem is not resolved and materials in the interior cannot be smoothly transported, then even if a free exchange market is maintained in the interior and buying and selling is carried out without limitation, it will not be possible to suppress the soaring of material prices. Moreover, after abandoning Shanghai and maintaining the exchange market in the interior, the material prices in Shanghai and the occupied areas are more expensive than those in the interior, and smugglers have no profit to be made, and the leakage of goods will also decrease. Moreover, there is currently a lot of hot money in the interior. If foreign exchange is bought and sold freely, can we guarantee that the funds will not flow out and the fund will not be exhausted? There will also be a big problem: Therefore, judging from the relationship between the material prices in the interior and Shanghai, maintaining the Shanghai exchange market is also necessary.

(4) Furthermore, judging from the extent of Japanese arbitrage of foreign exchange, since the European war, the international situation has become increasingly tense. The UK has been scouring for military supplies in its territory and has no surplus to supply to other countries. The US has increased its embargo on goods to Japan, and the military supplies that Japan can purchase from the US are also decreasing. Therefore, the use of British and American exchange has been greatly reduced compared to the past. On the other hand, the legal currency is the common currency in Shanghai and can be used to purchase materials in the occupied areas. Its use has been relatively expanded. Therefore, there is also a lot of room for review as to whether Japan must use legal currency to arbitrage all foreign exchange. In the past year, the Shanghai exchange rate has revolved around $6, and the Stabilization Fund has not had a significant supply, which is enough to prove this fact. It is difficult to predict how the international situation will change in the future, but there seems to be no reason to promote a sharp contraction of the exchange market at present. Now, if the Stabilization Fund comes out to maintain it, its work will be easy and much easier than in the first half of 1939!

(5) Finally, judging from the consequences of abandoning the Shanghai exchange market, if the government abandons the Shanghai exchange market, the legal currency will lose its support, hot money will flee in droves, and the exchange rate will inevitably contract sharply. In order to reorganize the Shanghai currency system, Japan will inevitably strictly control trade and foreign exchange. If trade control is implemented, it will be difficult for Shanghai goods to be transported to the interior. Even if Japan allows daily necessities to be released, they must first settle and sell foreign exchange to Japanese financial institutions. In this case, those who want to purchase Shanghai goods with legal currency as they do today will no longer be able to obtain them. Comparing the two, there is also a question as to whether it is beneficial. Moreover, friendly commercial businesses will be on the verge of collapse due to the sharp decline of the Shanghai legal currency and the control by the Japanese. They will inevitably rise up and contend!

### Conclusion

Due to the above various reasons, there is no doubt that this exchange stabilization fund will definitely be used to maintain the Shanghai exchange market. However, from the standpoint of the country, it is still necessary to study the most appropriate method of maintaining it, the maximum limit of maintenance, and the fundamental policies for the future.

In terms of maintenance methods, in addition to the various technical operating principles that the Stabilization Fund should abide by, we should also try to reduce Shanghai's hot money and stabilize the foreign exchange market. The only way to reduce Shanghai's hot money is to guide it to move inland. From the standpoint of those who keep hot money, moving funds inland can develop industries and increase profits. From the standpoint of the country, the government bank is now working hard to create funds, which is enough to develop industries, and it is not necessary to wait for Shanghai's hot money to move inland. However, the inland movement of hot money (1) can reduce Shanghai's funds and stabilize the exchange market, and (2) can balance the income and expenditure of Shanghai and the inland, and suppress the Shanghai exchange premium. Since the goods transported from Shanghai to the inland are more than those transported from the inland to Shanghai, from the perspective of trade income and expenditure, the amount of inland remittances to Shanghai is greater. Government banks must approve all inland remittances. When commercial banks operate free remittances, in order to transfer funds, they must ask for an exchange premium in the inland. If Shanghai's hot money moves inland, the number of Shanghai remittances to the inland will gradually increase, and the exchange premium will gradually decrease, until the exchange premium is eliminated. It also has the function of suppressing material prices. The government is now encouraging savings and increasing interest rates in the interior, which has the effect of attracting hot money. It is hoped that further efforts will be made in the future, and the benefits will be infinite!

### Arbitrage and Maintenance Base Point —Editor's Comments—

— Editor

When people discuss the issue of the application of the Stabilization Fund, they all pay attention to being arbitrage first. Because the Stabilization Fund fundamentally arises in a free exchange market, being arbitrage is unavoidable. However, arbitrage must have its purpose, and its purpose is nothing more than two: one is to seize China's foreign exchange to alleviate its shortage of foreign exchange, and the other is to promote the fall of the external value of the legal currency and conduct a monetary war.

Regarding the first purpose, rather than saying that it is to alleviate its shortage of foreign exchange, it is better to say that it is to supplement its material panic. Its fundamental purpose is to arbitrage foreign exchange to purchase war materials overseas. Since the European war, most of the war materials needed by Japan have been supplied by North America. In fact, apart from North America, Japan has no way to obtain advanced military supplies. Therefore, Japan's need for US exchange is extremely urgent. However, since the United States expanded the embargo, and as the international situation intensified, Japanese-American relations are almost limited to the mutual withdrawal of diplomats. American arms dealers do value their profits, but the British market is enough to satisfy their desires, and there is also demand from China, the Soviet Union, and other countries. Therefore, the Japanese market has in fact been abandoned long ago. For this reason, Japan's need for US exchange has been greatly reduced. The reason why there is no arbitrage effect in the Shanghai foreign exchange black market this year is this. The suspension of business by the four banks of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications once affected the exchange market, so Japanese commercial banks took the opportunity to spit out exchange and exchange for legal currency. This is also because holding US exchange is not as stable as holding legal currency to obtain materials. Today, Hitler is using Nanjing as a means of pressuring Japan to participate in the war quickly. Even if Japan wants to be cautious, it will have to make some gestures to perfunctorily deal with it. But no matter how perfunctory it is, the result will only increase the antagonism between the US and Japan. This kind of deteriorating news is now flying like snowflakes, which shows that Japan will no longer need US exchange in the future. The first purpose of arbitraging foreign exchange no longer exists at present.

Regarding the second purpose: Since Japan implemented the military currency policy, its attitude towards the legal currency has completely changed. Only with the existence of the legal currency can there be Shanghai's prosperity; only with the stability of Shanghai's financial sector can the operation of the socio-economy of Central China be maintained. Only with the continuation of the operation of the socio-economy of Central China can Japan have the possibility of promoting its "war to support war." Therefore, Japan has long changed its attitude of destroying the legal currency and used the legal currency as its primary tool. For this reason, Japan's second purpose of arbitraging foreign exchange no longer exists to this day, which is very clear.

Some may think that since maintaining the legal currency is beneficial to Japan, the Chinese government may abandon maintaining the Shanghai exchange market. Speculators often create rumors for this reason to threaten the exchange market. However, please read Mr. Sun Liyu's article, and you can know that there are more and greater facts and reasons to believe that the Chinese government's determination to maintain the legal currency and the exchange market will not change and is absolutely necessary. Mr. Sun compares the benefits of maintaining from the perspective of national interests, which are much greater than the harm, and his words are insightful and his observations are profound, which can be said to be a refreshing tonic for those who create rumors.

The Chinese government's consistent policy of maintaining the legal currency and the exchange market is a settled and unchangeable policy, and there is no room for doubt, which goes without saying. However, the base point at which it will be maintained is also a matter of great concern to speculators. Mr. Sun also has an important hint in this article. Why? Think about the current material prices. Are they not expensive enough? Mr. Sun clearly pointed out that maintaining the exchange rate is the reason for stabilizing material prices in the free area. Because the material prices in the free area are deeply affected by Shanghai, stabilizing the Shanghai foreign exchange market is one of the elements for stabilizing the material prices in the free area. The current high price of materials has already made people unable to make a living. Therefore, the application of the Stabilization Fund, at least to prevent the exchange rate from contracting again, is a matter of course. Mr. Sun also pointed out in this article that the characteristics of the Chinese Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund are different from those of the UK and the US. From this, it can be further inferred that the way the Chinese Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund is used is different from that of the UK and the US. The UK and the US aim to stabilize the exchange rate at one point, so the actual exchange rate is its stabilization base point. In other words: it is neither allowed to contract nor allowed to loosen. The reason for this is to eliminate the fluctuations in material prices, so that they will be stabilized with the stability of the exchange rate. As for China, it is suffering from the excessive decline in the exchange rate and the excessive rise in material prices. Therefore, for the application of the Stabilization Fund, on the one hand, the exchange rate is not allowed to contract again, and on the other hand, the exchange rate can be allowed to lengthen. Therefore, the actual exchange rate must be higher than the stabilization base point. When the actual exchange rate is too far above the stabilization base point, there is a possibility of raising the stabilization base point. Conversely, if the downward contraction of the actual exchange rate affects the stabilization base point, the stabilization operation must be more active. Only when the actual exchange rate is allowed to be higher than the stabilization base point can the necessary stabilization operation be more effective. People often regard the actual exchange rate as the level maintained by the Stabilization Committee. Whenever HSBC Bank absorbs foreign exchange, it is regarded as a change in the level maintained by the Stabilization Fund. The magnitude of their error is self-evident.

Recently, there has been a rumor in the speculative market that the banks in this city are about to stop doing fixed-term exchange bill transactions, the intention of which is to curb speculation and make the application of the Stabilization Fund more favorable. Everyone knows that the creation of international exchange is not only limited to solving the issue of the payment of the price of goods between two countries with different currency systems, but also to solving the problem that import and export trade does not suffer from the difficulty of capital turnover due to the time required for transportation. If fixed-term exchange is stopped and only spot delivery is allowed, then exporters must wait for the goods to be shipped abroad and obtain payment after a considerable period of time before they can sell their exchange bills. Not only do they risk being defrauded of exports and having no payment, but they also risk putting exporters in a state of inability to make ends meet and stop their business to wait for payment. Conversely, importers cannot choose a favorable time to settle foreign exchange in advance for each order, resulting in a loss from exchange rate changes for each transaction. Moreover, every time a cargo ship arrives at the port, importers rush to settle exchange bills, which is enough to create a large fluctuation in the exchange market. How can it be called stability? It is indeed not surprising that this statement is originally a rumor created by speculators, and it is unreasonable.

### Cigarette Market Situation Mediocre, Soap Mostly Declines

The cigarette market situation tends to be moderate, because manufacturers have dispatched goods to wholesalers in this city and other locations for sales. Speculators' appetites are exhausted, and the issue of tax increases is still under discussion, so people's confidence is still wavering. As a result, sales have decreased compared to before. The outgoing channels in this street are still smooth, causing the buying price to be hovering. Yesterday, the opening prices were 1,560 yuan per case for Great Britain brand, 1,114 yuan for Old Knife brand, 1,100 yuan for Pinhai brand, 744 yuan for Wuhua brand, 779 yuan for Little Fairy brand, 430 yuan per 10,000 for ten-piece Daqianmen, and 50 yuan per middle case for Golden Mouse brand. The market prices of each brand are slightly uneven compared to before.

The buying price of soap has seen a decline again. This is because speculators are selling at high prices, actual sales are weak, overseas raw material supply has not been interrupted, and speculators are stopping purchases and starting to sell. As a result, prices continue to trend downward. The price is 5.025 yuan per case for Guben soap, 42.5 yuan per case for Baixiangmao, and 39 yuan per case for Huangxiangmao. The price of Meili brand matches is still 730 yuan per case, and Phoenix brand is 710 yuan, with little change. White Li’s ship brand candles are 88 yuan and 8 jiao.

### Sugarcane and Cane Sugar (1)

— Gao Jiannong

—Foreign Affairs Section—

The stems and leaves are similar to those of sorghum, but sometimes the stems are thicker and have more nodes, which are the sugarcane that we children loved to suck on. There are many varieties of it; especially in recent years, people know that its seeds can also be propagated—previously only root division was used—and it is used to create many excellent new varieties. For example, according to the color of the stem: there are green, yellow, red, purple, orange-yellow, and light red varieties. According to the region: there are also Java black sugarcane, Calcutta red sugarcane, Chinese sugarcane, Taiwan sugarcane, and so on. In short, its footprint is now very wide: wherever the annual average temperature on Earth is not below 20 degrees Celsius, its graceful figure can be seen.

Where was sugarcane born? According to the investigation of many scholars, it is known to be in the area of the northern shore of the Bay of Bengal. But how many years ago did Indians cultivate and improve it? According to the Indian literature passed down and preserved to this day, we cannot be sure at all. What can be believed to be true is that Indians had already been drinking a 'sweet juice of a kind of reed' obtained by squeezing before the first few centuries AD. Later, they learned to boil this sweet juice and condense it into a slightly thicker liquid, like what we now call "syrup," to prepare various foods or medicines. If you ask when the real first refined sugar was created by Indians? This is another question that is difficult to answer accurately; however, we can assume that it was earliest between the first and second centuries AD. We know very little about this method of making sugar: probably the squeezed sugarcane juice was placed in pottery and boiled over a fire, and after it cooled and solidified, it was placed in a 裏 or mat and pressed with heavy objects such as stones. In this way, people got a kind of brown sugar block, some in the shape of a round ball, and some in the shape of a flat cake. If a few more steps are added, the sugar block is remelted, filtered, dried, and then people get that still moist yellow coarse sugar. —The syrup and coarse sugar mentioned above occupied a very important position in the life of ancient Indians: they used them to make various kinds of miscellaneous items for all kinds of celebrations, anniversaries, such as weddings, births, funerals, sacrifices, etc. Its use in medicine was also very common and broad.

The ancient Greeks and Romans only knew about honey; although they had heard a little about sugarcane and cane sugar, their impressions were extremely vague, and there was no specific term to represent it. For example, Alexander the Great and the Macedonian soldiers who expeditioned to India in 327 BC must have seen sugarcane with their own eyes; however, when the Greeks described it, it was: 'A majestic reed that can provide a kind of honey without the help of bees.' In 41 AD, a Greek doctor named Dioseoride wrote to the Greeks and Romans: 'Harvesting a kind of honey on the leaves of a reed.' (To be continued)

### Jiang Zhuzhuang's Lecture: My Personal Cultivation, Meeting and Believing in the Doctrines of Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Mohism, Cultivating Both Mind and Body, Becoming Healthier as One Ages

The sixth public lecture of the academic lecture series was held at the Xuan Palace Theater yesterday morning at 10 o'clock. Jiang Zhuzhuang gave a lecture on "My Outlook on Life and Cultivation," saying roughly that he had studied Chinese academics in the past and was greatly influenced by them. Roughly, his outlook on life is derived from the doctrines of Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Mohism. Now, let me explain them separately.

The Doctrines of the Four Schools

(1) The main purpose of Confucianism is "benevolence." "Benevolence" means "two people," that is, the moral issues between people. Its meaning is very broad. In other words, it is to love others and restrain oneself, and to regard the world as one family. In short, it is to forget oneself with a strong will. (2) Taoism advocates conforming to nature. Every move must be honest and not hypocritical, and should be natural and not forced. Whether it is the body or the mind, both should not violate nature. Therefore, the mind should be "quiet" so that the desires of the body can be naturally restrained and not forced to be satisfied. Therefore, suffering has no reason to arise. (3) Buddhism believes that the process of birth, aging, sickness, and death is only a physical change in the body. The so-called happiness and suffering in between are the products of this change. Roughly, happiness occurs when the environment is smooth, and suffering occurs when it is the opposite. Most people think that death is the most painful, but in fact, is life not painful? It is believed that the pain when a baby comes out of the mother's body is difficult to imagine. In short, there is no need to pay attention to the changes in birth, death, suffering, and happiness, because the mind does not die. If you understand this, you will not feel any pain at all. (4) As for the doctrine of Mohism, in a word, it is altruism, that is, what is now called sacrificing the individual to preserve the whole, and realizing the ideal of mutual love and eliminating selfishness. This statement is not without examination, as evidenced by some of Mozi's deeds in his life.

Personal Cultivation

Combining the doctrines of these four schools has produced my current outlook on life, which is ego-less-ness. Now, let me describe the cultivation in detail. I was weak and sickly since I was a child. When I was twelve or thirteen years old, I had tinnitus and back pain, and it got worse later. Palpitations, night sweats, and other symptoms followed, and I suffered from almost all kinds of diseases. In the two years when I was seventeen or eighteen years old, I had a fever almost every day of the year and suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis. Because I still studied as usual, my condition worsened. However, at this time, I obtained many books on cultivating the mind and body, such as "Nourishing the Mind," and I was very interested in them. When I was twenty-two years old, I got married and studied philosophy, and my body became weaker and my pulmonary tuberculosis became more severe. At the age of twenty-seven, I coughed up blood, and at the age of twenty-eight, I devoted myself to recuperation and lived alone in an isolation room, but it did not have a significant effect. I sought for several times and obtained a Taoist cultivation method that focused on the use of qi. Every month when I breathed, the qi I inhaled must penetrate into the lower abdomen and to the whole body, and every time I breathed, I often counted to ten. In this way, the mind and body were united, and the will became stronger and stronger. In the early years of the Republic of China, when I lived in Beiping, I used the "stop and observe method" of Buddhism to concentrate my mind, sit quietly, let go of everything, and did not think about anything. Although the claims of the Buddhist and Taoist schools, the former focused on the mind, and the latter took into account both the mind and body, there were slight differences, but both had advantages, so I believed in both schools, and the result was quite satisfactory. At the age of forty, my physical strength was healthier than at thirty, fifty was healthier than forty, and sixty was stronger than fifty, and I have not seen any decline so far. In short, the way to cultivate the mind and body is to only choose what is beneficial, and there is no need to stick to one school, and choose according to your interests.

Golden Needle for Young People

He also earnestly urged the young audience, saying that the most dangerous period in life is the period of youth development from fifteen or sixteen to twenty-one or twenty-two years old. During this period, it is best to be careful and avoid self-indulgence. If there is a mistake, it will cause endless harm. Most young people have yellow skin and are thin. Fortunately, pay attention to this.

Live Performance

After speaking, he demonstrated the Taijijian swordplay and meditation method that he has used to cultivate his body and mind in recent years in public. First, he showed the posture and rules of meditation, and then performed his Taijijian swordplay. His movements were agile and relaxed, just like a middle-aged man. The whole audience applauded.

The Peiyuan Cup charity small football match kicked off at the Jiaozhou Road Poor Children's Nursing Home yesterday afternoon. Although the weather was hot, there were nearly a thousand spectators. Honorary Chairman Zheng Yaonan, Guo Boliang, Chairman Guo Shouchun and others all came to watch the match. The venue was maintained by the scouting troop of the nursing home, and the band played music. The cup match between Hualian and Shung Kee first clashed, with Zheng Yaonan kicking off. Judge Wei Shegeng, Hualian's momentum was quite strong when they came on the field. Lin Dianhua scored a goal in five minutes. Shung Kee counterattacked, and Zhao Yongfang successfully returned the ball. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw. After changing sides, Hualian had bad luck. Lin Dianhua first gave a gift to the opponent, and Han Longhai scored twice. Shung Kee took the lead with a score of 4-1. After that, they persisted for a long time. Chen Xiaoqing of Hualian and Shen Jinda of Shung Kee each scored a goal. Soon the time ended, and Shung Kee eliminated Hualian with a score of 5-2. In the final exhibition match between Nanyang and Yizhong, the two sides were evenly matched. As a result, Yizhong defeated Nanyang with a score of 1-0. In the final cup match between Samsung and Leyou, in addition to the famous players such as Chen Yuanji, Wu Shaotai, and Fafanxiao, Samsung's goalkeeper Dong Jincai was replaced by the Portuguese Iron Gate M. Su Ruo due to injury, so it was even more powerful. Leyou yesterday had the help of the generals Cai Shengsen, Li Yichen, Jia Youliang and others, and their strength was extraordinarily strong, so the two sides performed extremely tense and exciting. Samsung's Wu Shaotai got Fafanxiao's wonderful pass and headed the ball into the net, breaking the record. Samsung's Xiao Ziwen went straight to the Yellow Dragon alone. Samsung took the lead with a score of 2-0 in the first half. After changing sides, Leyou's lineup changed greatly. Meng Yiliang took the center forward position, assisted by Jia and Ye Yiting on both wings. The situation improved. Jia Youliang pulled back a city. Samsung's misfortune did not come singly. In the last three minutes, Ye Yiting got a pass from Jia Youliang and swept it into the net in front of the goal. Leyou and Samsung tied 2-2 and will be replayed at a later date.

### The Research Method of History (2)

— Xue Wujing

2.  The Value of History

Confucianists entrusted the ancient to reform the system, praising Tang and Yu, what followed Yao and Shun, and what constitutioned Wen and Wu. These were all ideas of restoring the ancient, while Xun Qing's Law of the Later Kings and Han Fei's Praise of the New Saints had already broken these ideas. If we still cling to the old and aim to restore the ancient, then all cultural systems will be too much trouble. It is better to have the ancient age of 獉獉狉狉. May I ask if this can work? Wang Anshi said well, "Ancestors are not to be feared, and sages are not to be imitated." Han Feizi said, "Discussing the affairs of the world, preparing for them according to the suitability of things." What great mind and courage is this? I think the Han Dynasty may not be inferior to the Zhou and Qin Dynasties, and the Tang Dynasty may even surpass the Han Dynasty. Modern times have surpassed the Tang Dynasty. Although there is a phenomenon of relaxation in the middle dynasty, generally speaking, there is only progress and no retreat, only reform and no cycle. People who study history, seeing this point, then the origin of culture, the evolution of the nation, the changes of society, the rise and fall of prefectures and countries, the evolution of the political system, and the relationship between China and foreign countries are all active before our eyes. Moreover, we, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, have planned and expanded the territory to have today's development, and the race can have today's harmony. The transmission of good words and deeds and the moving stories of heroes make us who read them naturally generate the concept of loving the country and protecting the species. Moreover, Chinese culture in Asia has spread east to the Korean Peninsula and the Bering Strait, west to the Pamirs, north to Inner and Outer Mongolia, and south to the Indochina Peninsula. It has the qualifications of the master of the East and has the sense of "who else but me?" This is the true value of history.

3.  The Types of History

The status of history did not have a special name in Liu Xin's Seven Summaries. It was only when Xun Xu divided it into four parts that there was the name of historical records and old events in the C section. It was not until the Sui Book's Records of Classics that the History section was divided into thirteen categories. However, ancient and modern works are as vast as the sea. Each family's category has its own claims. Explaining them one by one is too troublesome. For the convenience of research, they are divided into the following two categories:

(1) Official History

(A) Biographical style: Twenty-Five Histories (not listed)

(B) Chronological style: Bamboo Annals, Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government, etc.

(C) Topical style: Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government Events, Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasty Events, and Zuo Zhuan Topical Interpretation, etc.

(2) Miscellaneous History

(A) Separate History category: Yi Zhou Shu, Lu Shi, Shi Tong, Sixteen Kingdoms Spring and Autumn Annals, etc.

(B) Political documents category: Three Comprehensive, Continued Three Comprehensive, Qing Three Comprehensive, etc.

(C) Geography category: Commentary on the Water Classic, Summary of Waterways, etc. (D) Catalog category: 1. Official books: Complete Library in Four Branches, General Catalogue, Questions and Answers on Booklists, etc. 2. Private books: Guangchuan Collection of Books, Records of Reading Books in Junzhai, etc. (3. Historical Records: Sui Book Records of Classics, Tang Book Records of Arts and Literature, General Examination of Literature, etc.

4.  Points to Note in Research

Among all kinds of learning in China, historiography is the most developed. Among all countries in the world, Chinese historiography is the most developed. However, what is compiled includes astronomy, geography, river channels, politics, education, economy, thought, and scholarship. In fact, it is just a pile of historical materials, and it is not very effective. However, it must be said that people who study history, where else can they find materials besides books? Fortunately, modern learning is developed, and the methods of learning include deductive method, inductive method, and dialectical method. People who are familiar with the art of thinking and social sciences can naturally pick gold and select sand from ancient books, classify them, and get valuable materials when compiling history. That is, people who study history can also use effective methods to select materials and control materials. Now, the points to note are described separately.

### Fourteen Styles of Sleep

— Liang

According to medical research, sleeping posture can express the rigidity and softness of each person's temperament and the quality of character, and sleep has a close relationship with people's health, which has been tacitly approved by people in all directions. Not long ago, a certain medical journal in Chicago, USA, explained the various styles of human sleep, and the content was quite interesting, so it is translated as follows:

(1) Sleeping prone: The person has unique insights, strong character, and a spirit of independent struggle.

(2) Sleeping supine with hands clenched: The person has a pure will, works tirelessly, has perseverance, and always has the ambition to fight for a long time and win the final victory.

(3) Sleeping supine with limbs stretched out: The person is generous and magnanimous, but likes vanity and has a little bit of laziness.

(4) Sleeping away from the pillow and without a quilt: The person pays attention to freedom, is not easily bound by others, often shows his edge and has no self-control.

(5) Sleeping covered supine: The person's temperament must be indecisive, indecisive in case of trouble, and controlled by others.

(6) Sleeping supine with hands as pillows: The person is a dreamy optimist, slippery in nature, and makes people unpredictable.

(7) Sleeping lying on the side and turning left and right: The person is narrow-minded, lacks the spirit of enduring hardship, and has agile and intelligent thinking.

(8) Sleeping with mouth open: The person is dull and pitiful, has little memory, and is prone to nasal diseases.

(9) Sleeping with knees bent on the side: The person is timid as a mouse, always self-satisfied, has little creative ability, and is prone to stomach diseases and dystocia.

(10) Sleeping with snoring: The person works diligently, has talent that cannot be displayed, is not admired by others, and is prone to chest blood syndrome.

(11) Sleeping with gnashing of teeth: The person's nerves are not healthy, the situation is lively, and both qi and blood are deficient.

(12) Sleeping with sleepwalking: The person is very frustrated and must have an ambiguous and unspeakable concealment.

(13) Sleeping with eyes open: The person has sensitive feelings and has depression.

(14) The last style is the most excellent sleeping posture. Sleeping on the side with limbs stretched out, with eyes and mouth seeming to be open and not open, and a natural attitude. . This is the most enjoyable sleep, and when you wake up during the day, you are full of energy and energy, and you can enjoy the happiness of life. I hope readers will pay attention to it.

### Strange Shoes

— Yu Guang

In general, women always pay special attention to clothing. They would rather save money on food at ordinary times and use it on clothing. From head to toe, hair, clothes, socks, and shoes are of course the same. Clothing styles change every year, and the types are really countless. Just talking about the shoes worn on the feet, if their types and styles are listed one by one, there must be no less than hundreds of kinds. Now let's look at the following rare shoes; the most interesting are the long pointed shoes of the near ancient times in Europe. Some shoe tips have bells, and some shoe tips are connected to a belt. The styles of shoes in other countries are also very strange, such as the deerskin shoes of the natives of North America, the snowshoes of Canada, and the straw sandals of India. They are indeed rarely seen here. (See the picture below)

### Mrs. Fish

— Chen Nianyun

A friend from Hunan visited yesterday and told me that the story of "Mrs. Fish," a famous Hunan dish, was very interesting. He said: "The former Governor of Hunan Province, Liu Zhi's wife, was the inventor of Mrs. Fish. Mrs. Liu liked to eat fish. In the early years when she arrived in Hunan, she entered a certain restaurant and progressed. She had heard of the name of the Yellow River carp and wanted to taste it. The waiter brought in the carp, but the lady ate it and it did not taste good, so she was very unhappy; she summoned the chef and told him a new cooking method: first fry the fish thoroughly with oil, add a little pepper and vinegar, boil it, then add good wine, soy sauce, white sugar and other seasonings, and then boil it slightly. The chef followed her words, and the fish tasted very good; after that, the restaurants competed to imitate it, and Mrs. Fish became popular in the local area, and it is also a good story of food." The friend also said that Mrs. Fish tastes sour and spicy without any fishy smell. He had also tasted it, and it was indeed very wonderful.

### Painting Bamboo at the Wanzhu Shufang Studio

— Zheng Yimei

Xue Yehe once said, "When people live in houses, they must have three parts water and two parts bamboo, which makes the house good." Bamboo, in its nature, is hollow inside and pure outside, adding tranquility and seclusion. Compared to delicate peach blossoms and luxuriant plum trees, it possesses a unique character. My friend, the lay Buddhist Chen Zixiao, has a fondness akin to that of Wang Ziyou. He built a room amidst the dense bamboo shadows, naming it "Wanzhu Shufang." He occasionally paints bamboo, needing no formal teacher. He mostly draws inspiration from the sunlight and moonlight reflected on the paper windows and white walls, sharing the same artistic ideals as my family's Banqiao Weng. Whether it's the strong rain leaves, the dew-moistened leaves, the wind-blown leaves, or the snow-pressed leaves, he captures their essence and transforms them, not adhering rigidly to a single style or form. Ziqing is fond of ink, and his studio houses a rich collection of inkstones. During his leisure time, he often caresses them for pleasure. It is said that he has spent over twenty years collecting masterpieces of famous figures, such as Fang Yulu's "Phoenix and Nine Chicks," Jin Dongxin's "Five Hundred Jin of Oil," Zai Xinong's "Chrysanthemum Fragrance Ointment," Chen Mansheng's "Planting Elm Immortal Hall," and the Shoushan Fuhai made during the Shunzhi reign, all of which are treasured more than jade. At the end of the year, he offers wine to them and paints a "Sacrifice to Ink" picture to record their elegant traces. It is said that his disciple Peng Gongfu will hold a joint exhibition of teacher and student paintings from July 9th to 13th at the Daxin Building. Gongfu's landscapes are profound and heavy, delving into the styles of the Song and Yuan dynasties. His bamboo paintings are also praised for their elegance and beauty. He has always been a giant of the Zheng Society, alongside Wu Hufan, Zhang Shanzi, and Zhang Daqian. Even small pieces of his work are treasured by people. The combination of their talents is truly a grand event in the art world.

### Longevity

— Xingzhi

I read a certain book and came across a section about "Three Old Men," which evoked many feelings. It seems that the way to "longevity" has been fully described in a few words. I record it as follows:

"Zhuangzi walked in the wilderness and saw three old men in the fields, with vigorous spirits and tireless farming. Zhuangzi was surprised and asked them how old they were. They all replied with eighty or ninety years. Zhuangzi was surprised and asked how they achieved this:

One old man laughed and said: 'I have a regular schedule for work and rest every day.'

The second pointed to his stomach and said: 'I have never overeaten.'

The third continued: 'I have no other secret, but I never cover my head with a blanket when I sleep at night.'

Zhuangzi left and thought deeply about the words of the three old men, gaining a profound understanding."

### The World's Fastest Records

— A Jin

Steamship: Can travel 143 miles per hour.

Car: 370 miles per hour.

Airplane: 462 miles per hour.

Locomotive: 125 miles per hour. With 15 carriages.

Bicycle: 80 miles per hour.

Motorcycle: 154 miles per hour.

### The Morality of Riding Public Transportation

— Anonymous

A few days ago, I saw someone publish "The Morality of Walking," which made me think of a few things about riding public transportation. If everyone could pay attention to these points, I think everyone would feel "convenient for others, convenient for yourself" when riding. Now, let's talk about getting on and off the bus.

When we are standing at the station and see the bus coming, don't rush to get on first, because this will inevitably cause everyone to crowd together. After the bus stops and the people on the bus have gotten off, then get on the bus one after another. It is best to let the elderly, weak, women, and those who have been waiting at the station first. Do not rush to be first, or everyone will squeeze at the entrance, which will delay time even more. If there is no rush and the bus is already too crowded, or if two buses have arrived one after another, then there is no need to take the first bus. We often see that when two buses are connected, the bus in the back is always more empty.

After getting on the bus, do not rush to grab a seat. Empty seats should be given to the elderly and weak first. Young men can be a little braver and stand for a while without getting too tired. Sometimes we even see men sitting in small gaps between two passengers, pressing right on their bodies. Passengers without seats should stand at the innermost end of the carriage, not at the door or near the door, to avoid preventing other passengers from getting on and off. Within the possible range, do not smoke in the car. Spitting is even more forbidden. Do not bring dirty items. Stepping on feet is common due to the movement of the car. Do not fuss over these small matters.

After the bus arrives at the station, do not crowd at the door waiting to get off. This makes it difficult for the person opening the door to reach out and open the door. It is best to wait for the door to open and then exit in an orderly manner. There is no benefit to being the first to get off the bus.

The above points are for everyone's convenience. I hope passengers will pay attention to them. (With gratitude)

### Selecting Fresh Fish

— Jianhua

The flesh of fresh fish is bright and shiny, has elasticity, and leaves no marks when pressed with a finger.

The eyes of fresh fish are slightly protruding and transparent with luster.

The gills of fresh fish are bright red and have no unpleasant odor when smelled.

The scales of fresh fish are shiny and difficult to fall off when brushed against the grain.

Anything with the above characteristics is sure to be fresh fish; otherwise, it is undoubtedly stale fish.

If the economy is prosperous, it is certainly possible to eat a lot. Recently, loofah has also been launched on the market, and the price is not expensive. Two corners of money can buy seven or eight. This thing is a treasure for vegetarian old ladies. Braise it with gluten, edamame, dried tofu, assorted mushrooms, etc., and it is very delicious. I don't often hear about other methods, but my family has stir-fried loofah with sliced ​​meat, which is also unique.

Spring and Autumn

### Love Suicide

— Juehui

Two people, a man and a woman, first check into a hotel room, and then pour out their hearts; they cry to each other and swallow poison together. As long as the porter discovers it tomorrow and it is published in the newspaper the day after tomorrow, it will be considered a love suicide!

There have been too many love suicides recently. (Those who are brave enough to pull out a pistol can be called love suicides for national mourning. Love suicides are like lovebirds of the same fate. They are like the "may we be twin branches on the earth, may we be birds flying wing-to-wing in the sky" that people have chewed over and over again. If they can't become twin branches, they run "to the sky" to become birds flying wing-to-wing.

Some people say: Love suicides are brave, courageous, and insightful. They should raise their thumbs and shout, "You have guts!"

Some people say: Love suicides are respectable, admirable, and enviable. They should shake their heads and shout, "Rare!"

The result of raising thumbs and shaking heads is:

There have been too many love suicides recently.

They don't die from artillery fire, they don't die on the battlefield; they are not scolded to death, they are not beaten to death, they don't die from illness... but they have to use four hands and four feet and one head to die in "love"!

If there is anything more stupid than this, I... I dare not guarantee that it is a human being!

### A "Woman" Who Hasn't Woken Up

— Wave

The child has lice on his head. Her face is full of powder.

Before pushing open the door, the noisy laughter, jeers, and "crackling!" sounds pierced my ears.

The door opened. A strong light from hundreds of electric lights shone brightly.

"Crackling!"..."All in one suit"..."Haha":

I don't really know the other "protagonist" who is determined to "fight". But from her decorations, I can tell that she is a "heroine" who often goes in and out of social circles! With her towering hair, face full of powder, silk cheongsam, and a cigarette slanted in her mouth, she turned her head and kept going to the "upper house" Oh...uh huh!...hum hum! "socializing".

After finishing dinner, they still wanted to "fight". But I don't know why Wei Ti came up with an idea "Let's go see a movie"... They swarmed out like a hurricane, and I couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.

"Who is that woman?" I asked someone for trouble.

"It's your second sister..." The man said slowly. But before he finished speaking, I guessed who it was. Then "Oh" said, and then said: "Still very young."

"People have seven children." She said seriously.

"Seven!" I didn't believe that a person who had raised seven children could still be so beautiful and modern. I thought: "Her children must be very..."

"This kind of woman is also rare," she said: "Just leave her children at home and come out to play alone."

"Seven children are all at home? Don't go to school?"

"What school! The children are locked in the room, and she goes to see movies and play mahjong. She doesn't care about the children at all. They all have lice on their heads!"

"Then: What do the children eat?"

"The eldest daughter cooks, only twelve years old!" She muttered, and my body went cold, and I couldn't stand up.

The next day, I talked to a friend about this. He said in his usual inverted sentence: "There are many! In China, this kind of woman. Garbage of the progress of the times!"

I couldn't help but use a sentence from Sunrise, looking at the ceiling and saying: "The sun is about to rise, but they are going to sleep!" (Gratitude)

### Principal: "What can be done, everyone help me, increasing fees is not just our problem!"

— By Binghong

### Small Statistics

— Xinru

From the experiment, we know that there are more than 46,000 grains of rice in a bowl, more than 138,000 grains of rice in a liter, more than 1.38 million grains of rice in a peck, and more than 13.8 million grains of rice in a stone.

Note: The tester used Saigon No. 1 pointed rice, which costs 130 yuan per stone. A bowl of rice weighs 9 taels and 2 qian. 500 grains of rice weigh 1 tael.

It is also calculated that the value of one grain of rice is 94/100,000ths, that is, 354 grains of rice are worth one copper coin, and a bowl of rice is worth about 1 jiao, 1 fen, and 8 li.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Ten. The Heart of a Loving Father

"Okay, okay, thank you for your care!" He accompanied the smile and walked back into the corridor, but did not have the courage to stand in front of the window to look again; he worried that Mei Bao's classmates were still discussing his ugly appearance!

Ugly appearance? In the psychology of Begonia, this is really more ridiculous than having no money, no food, and no clothes. He even once said to Mei Bao:

"Child, don't tell them that I am your father, just say that I am a handyman at home, then they won't laugh at you."

Mei Bao certainly couldn't agree.

"Dad, you can actually say such a thing!" She tightly grasped Begonia's shoulder and said: "You are my biological father

Beware of damp heat and summer suffering.

, good dad, why can't I tell people? You said you are ugly, this is your own suspicion! I see people walking on the street, everyone is uglier than you, why are they not afraid of being laughed at? I said my dad is the most handsome, like a beauty in the past, and now like a hero in a play. If you don't believe me, ask Zhang Xiaogouzi!"

Zhang Xiaogouzi and Begonia all laughed.

Regarding Mei Bao's entering junior high school in the second half of the year, Begonia had been planning in his heart since last year; although there is no middle school in Zhangshu Village, the nearest one is still in Hengshui County, but this is not enough to shake his determination. He only worries that Mei Bao will live alone in the school, and will definitely not get used to that kind of hardship.

"Do you think it is easy to rent a house in the city?" One day, he once asked Xiaogouzi; for his daughter's studies, he was simply preparing to move again. (151)

### How to Help Poor Students

— Ji Fufang

The two-month summer vacation has come again. Some students, after being restricted for half a year, now have a chance to have fun, and are planning to swim, go to night gardens, and watch movies, with no worries about the future. As for poor students, after finishing the exams, they can't help but plan for the next semester, especially tuition, which is the biggest problem.

Tuition has increased, by 30% or 50%, and books and stationery are also very expensive. This burden is very difficult for poor students to solve, but their determination to study and make progress is unusually firm and very admirable.

At present, many enthusiastic education workers have created "education loans," "relief funds," and "scholarships" to help poor students study. The scope of the sky is wide, including the loans from several newspapers and the relief funds from the student department of the Youth Association. In addition, each school has "scholarships," "free places," and other preferential treatment. Even private individuals have donated a sum of money to help some students. This kind of action is a good phenomenon in society.

However, the method of distributing these "loans" and "scholarships" is not very perfect. Generally, you first apply, submit transcripts, or hold a decision-making test, make a decision-making visit, and require proof from the school and reliable people to guarantee that you are excellent in character and learning, and that your family is poor, and then provide relief.

In fact, this method has many drawbacks. Academic excellence is based on the overall average score as the standard, but in many private schools, teachers treat scores as gifts, and 80 or 90 points are very easy to obtain. In schools that teach seriously, 70 points or more is already at the top. Moreover, some hard-working students with poor talents and slightly lower grades cannot get relief. As for visiting a decision, it is not easy to investigate clearly. As far as the author knows, schools issue proof documents, mostly without refusal. In short, this method of relief only requires performing a series of procedures and does not require much effort. As a result, some students use tuition for making clothes and playing, or apply for relief because they do not have enough pocket money, and sometimes they can be considered qualified, so that those who really need relief cannot enjoy the right.

A more effective and fairer way to help poor students is to issue scholarships on the condition of "service." Many enthusiastic social workers in Shanghai use this summer vacation to organize some public welfare undertakings, such as hygiene work, charity work, voluntary education, etc., which are served by poor students for about two or three hours a day. When school starts, the existing funds for various student relief can be distributed according to the service providers. In this way, only those who are willing to endure hardship and really need relief are willing to do it, and students who attempt to cheat will not participate. At the same time, the two months of these outstanding students will not be wasted. During the service period, it is not difficult to know about their conduct and service ability. It is more beneficial to society.

The author has another suggestion. Major commercial institutions, factories, and cultural institutions on the island, if they need short-term workers, it is not easy to find them. They can widely hire poor students so that they can get remuneration to pay for their studies. Generally, students with a middle school education can be very competent in the work of an ordinary employee. In addition, there are not a few people with special fighting skills. There are many things that students can do. Although this method has existed before, it has not been popularized; it is urgently needed to be developed at present.

For the methods of helping Qing Sai students, I hope that people from all walks of life can pay more attention and discuss more, and must be practical and universal. It is permissible that when tuition increases, there will be a large number of out-of-school children and young people who urgently need relief.
