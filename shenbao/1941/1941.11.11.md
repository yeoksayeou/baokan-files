### London's New Mayor Takes Office Last Night; British Prime Minister Delivers Important Speech; Ready for the Pacific Crisis; If the US and Japan Clash, Britain Will Declare War on Japan

Reuters, London, 10th—Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech today at the luncheon on the inauguration day of the new Mayor of the City, Sir Laurie, stating that the war launched by Hitler has now spread across the entire European continent, invading Cambodia, North Africa, and involving the greater Asia, and may soon spread to the remaining quarter of the globe. The world has been greatly shocked by the Nazi massacre of French hostages. Even the inherently cruel Hitler is intimidated by the criticism of world opinion and dares not continue this process of massacring hostages. A large part of the American Navy is now taking action to deal with the common enemy. Regarding the Mediterranean, the passage of our supplies and the decline of Italian naval morale both indicate that the area is still under our control. We feel that if necessary, we have more than enough strength to send powerful naval forces to serve in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. At present, our air force is at least equal to the German side in quantity, not to mention the quality. We do not know whether the United States' efforts to maintain peace in the Pacific will be successful, but if they fail, then my duty compels me to take this opportunity to make a solemn declaration: if the United States is drawn into war against Japan, Britain will follow suit within an hour. In fact, if the Japanese people unnecessarily involve themselves in this world war, the future seems to be very dangerous, because in this war, Japan may find that the total population of the countries opposing it in the Pacific accounts for about three-quarters of humanity. If modern warfare is based on steel, then it is dangerous for Japan, with an annual steel production of only about seven million tons, to challenge the United States, which produces ninety million tons of steel annually, without reason, let alone adding the steel production of the British Empire. I sincerely hope that peace in the Pacific will be maintained according to the wishes of Japan's wisest politicians, but all preparations to defend British interests in the Far East and the common cause in the current crisis have been completed and are being improved. We have received reports from many sources that Berlin will soon make peace proposals again. Such signs have been found in various neutral countries. I now solemnly declare again that whether we have help or fight alone, no matter how long the period or how difficult the experience, Britain and its government will cooperate closely with the governments of the various autonomous regions and will never conduct any negotiations with Hitler or any representative of the Nazi regime in Germany. Recently, the Prime Minister also mentioned China, saying that if the Chinese nation's struggle to resist aggression fails to achieve liberation, it will be a great misfortune for world civilization. My feelings above are the emotions in our hearts.

United Press, Kansas City, 10th—Former Chief of Staff of the US Fleet, General Sterling, said in a speech here yesterday, "The American people, at this time when they are fully engaged in dealing with Hitler's actions in the Atlantic, have been aroused to fury by Japan's hostile attitude. If one believes that Japan today is stabbing the United States in the back with a white blade, then the issue of a US-Japan war has become a very common argument in any party in the United States. Generally, it is also believed that the country will face the situation it has felt before to make a final conclusion on the US-Japan issue. The United States is currently very willing to find ways to prevent Japan from actually cooperating with the Axis powers and engaging in shooting wars, because Britain recognizes that its war with Hitler is inevitable and wants to avoid a two-ocean war." He also said that once the United States and Japan go to war, Britain will inevitably launch an engagement with the Japanese from Singapore, and the United States will also try to use bombers to bomb Japan from Vladivostok.

Reuters, London, 10th—The Times' editorial today stated that the recent discussions between the British Far East Representative Duff Cooper, the Commander-in-Chief of India Wavell, and the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Forces Parkin and Blamey are a sign of the increasingly tense and complex situation. In the current situation, political and military issues are more closely linked than usual, and the interests of any part of the British Empire are also deeply involved. India is an important key to the common defense line, and it is also aware that if any party in the Axis wins, Indian civilization will come to an end from then on. Therefore, India, Burma, the Straits Settlements, and Hong Kong are all paying great attention to the fate of the Dutch East Indies, Thailand, and China at this time. This concern travels across the Pacific Ocean to Canada and the United States. The feeling of common danger and common interests unites the people around the Pacific, and the future developments in the Pacific will be closely linked to the fate of the war in the Soviet Union. Because of the Soviet Union's power and the vastness of its territory, the Soviet Union is a factor in the Pacific that is just as important as on the European and Middle Eastern fronts. In recent months, a large number of reinforcements in many parts of the world have arrived in Singapore. This is an open secret. Although the terrain makes Singapore a natural military concentration point for the safety of the Pacific, whether it is also the most convenient central point for adjusting political and strategic decisions is another matter. Certainly, an agency is needed to quickly exchange views on common defense in the Pacific among the countries concerned. The United States' material and spiritual interests and its authority make it necessary for the US government to be fully aware of the various steps taken and planned, and the methods set should also have the full consent of the US government. Because if Britain, the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands unite and persevere, they can resist aggression from any direction. If Britain, the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands clearly express their position through their actions, there will be less possibility of being forced to test their united strength in any new war.

### At the Reception for Reporters, Jiang Ting-fu Analyzes Japan's Recent Attempts; Peace with the US is a Trick Like Hitler's Against Britain; "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is Actually Another Name for an Economic Bloc

Secretary-General Jiang of the Executive Yuan of Chongqing made the following remarks at a reception for foreign reporters on the 10th: Recently, while the Japanese army has been increasing troops in Vietnam, it has also sent Kurusu to the United States. According to official and non-official Japanese statements, Japan's intentions are twofold: one is to maintain peace between the United States and Japan, and the other is to build a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." There is no need to say much about the first point. Years ago, Hitler also presented himself as a pacifist. In fact, Hitler's intention was nothing more than to have European countries accept German hegemony, and Germany could avoid using force. What we should pay particular attention to is that although Hitler once used peace to seduce all of Germany's neighbors, his peace offensive paid special attention to Britain. He repeatedly declared that Germany had no ambitions towards Britain, that there was no conflict of interest between Germany and Britain, and that Germany and Britain should and could make peace. Today, the people of England must regret that British leaders were once seduced by this peace. The current Japanese peace offensive against the United States is the same as Hitler's strategy a few years ago. If the countries along the Pacific coast are willing to accept Japan's oppression, we may be able to obtain short-term peace, but the pain of this kind of peace far exceeds any tragic war. Fortunately, none of the Pacific countries are willing to accept this kind of peace. President Roosevelt's recent speech to the International Labor Conference has earnestly reiterated the position of the United States. In addition, Australia and the Dutch East Indies are neither deceived by the Japanese peace nor moved by Japan's increasing troops in Vietnam. As for China, our determination to fight to the end is beyond doubt. The attitudes of the Pacific countries towards Japan's recent strategy have already achieved a complete understanding. As for what the Japanese call the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," what they want to say can be summarized in one sentence, that is, the "Co-Prosperity Sphere" is a sphere of common suffering and common death. Economically speaking, the trade between China and Japan is far less important than the trade between the two countries and Europe, the United States, and South America. Japan lacks rice, and so does China. Japan does not produce oil, and neither does China. Japan feels that it lacks coal and iron, and China does not have a large surplus of coal and iron. Japan exports silk and tea, and so does China. In addition, China also exports tung oil, but Japan does not import our tung oil. The above extremely obvious economic facts must be well known to Japanese ambitious people, but they repeatedly use the establishment of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as the theme of their propaganda. The reason is none other than that Japan's Co-Prosperity Sphere must include areas outside of East Asia. Therefore, I am even more convinced that Japan's peace is only a kind of propaganda strategy, and Japan's "Co-Prosperity Sphere" is actually another name for an economic bloc. We believe that bloc economics means collective poverty and will cause economic wars between blocs. We believe that the international economic liberalism announced by Mr. Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt after their meeting on the Atlantic is practical and can give all mankind hope for coexistence and common prosperity. Now Japan does not do this, but instead uses force to establish a medieval-style bloc economy, which proves that its intention is not peace but hegemony. (10th dispatch)

### Wartime Children's Welfare Association; Enthusiastic Donations from All Sides; A Total of More Than 10,000 Refugee Children are Cared For; Most of the Funding is Raised by Madame Chiang

Chongqing—Since its establishment, the Wartime Children's Welfare Association has cared for more than 25,000 refugee children in various war zones. Most of the funding is raised by Madame Chiang through donations from various circles at home and abroad. Recently, Madame Chiang has received a large amount of donations, including US$2,000 from Princess Hoger of India and US$2,000 from Mr. Anger of the United States. Mr. Chapman's younger brother is a doctor at Lake Chuan Hospital and is usually passionate about China and actively involved in various relief and welfare undertakings. The brothers Huang Ming'an and Huang Jin'ying of Sichuan donated 100,000 national currency to commemorate their mother's 60th birthday. Mr. Huang Ming'an is the manager of the Sancaisheng Coal Mine Company and a director of the Huahua Leather Company. Mr. Huang Jin'ying is a director of the Hengfeng Enterprise Company's Fuhua Bleaching Powder Company. They are the descendants of the late giant gentleman Huang Xizi. Over the years, they have vigorously assisted the New Life Movement and welfare undertakings. This time, they donated 100,000 yuan to the Welfare Association and 10,000 yuan to the New Life Movement Model Area for children's welfare undertakings. In addition, an anonymous person donated 4,144.438 yuan in national currency through Dr. Chen Wenyuan. Recently, Mr. Zheng Zhizhi, a wheat merchant in Hong Kong, donated 100,000 yuan in national currency to the Children's Welfare Association to commemorate his mother's 70th birthday. It is also heard that Mr. Zheng plans to allocate some of the congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends to Madame Chiang for relief purposes. Madame Chiang is very excited that all parties are extremely caring for the children's welfare undertakings. However, recently, because the cost of living in various places is increasing day by day, although donations from home and abroad are coming in steadily, they still feel insufficient. They deeply hope that compatriots at home and abroad will continue to enthusiastically donate to actively promote the welfare undertakings and benefit the new citizens of the next generation.

### US Navy Department Gathers Heavy Artillery; Prepares to Implement Armed Merchant Ships; Amendment to the Neutrality Act Will Soon Be Passed by the House of Representatives; Establishing a Base in Iceland is of Extreme Importance

International News Service, Washington, 10th—The US Navy Department is busy gathering heavy artillery to major ports across the country. About 1,200 US merchant ships, it is heard that 400 of them will be armed. As for what impact the arming of merchant ships will have on US-German relations, the general public believes that it will not immediately lead to a severance of relations. The State Department has appointed Brownell, the director of the refugee department, to succeed Morris as the representative in Berlin.

United Press, Washington, 10th—The House of Representatives yesterday predicted that the Neutrality Act amendment would be passed on Thursday, thereby completing Congress's decision on the matter. Isolationist congressmen believe that this move will cause the United States to participate in the European war. According to Bloom, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the amendment will be passed by a vote of 75 to 100, but other leaders predict that the bill will be passed by a ratio of 30 to 40. The Navy, upon President Roosevelt's signing, has completed the installation of heavy artillery on US merchant ships. The Navy Department has prepared all the heavy artillery it can obtain, the largest being 5 inches. The Senate has passed the arming of American ships and entering belligerent ports and belligerent areas, and the House of Representatives initially passed the arming of American ships.

United Press, Washington, 10th—After Navy Secretary Knox announced the establishment of a US naval operations base in Iceland, naval observers believe that this move is another important step in preparing to directly transport supplies to British and Soviet seaports using American ships. These observers said that the official announcement that the base was established for management and operational purposes shows that comprehensive equipment has been completed to handle various types of warships. Naval observers pointed out that after Congress passes the lifting of the prohibition on American ships entering combat zones, the Iceland base will occupy an extremely important position in the Atlantic war. Although the Navy has not generally discussed this matter, it is expected that destroyers and seaplanes, as well as larger surface warships, will use the dangerous area east of Iceland as a departure zone. Although goods transported to Britain do not all have to pass near Iceland, it is believed that ships going to Soviet seaports in the Arctic Ocean will use the base on a large scale because of geographical reasons and the longer journey, or the need to add fuel. In addition, the Iceland base is also an extremely important link in the defense of the Western Hemisphere, because it is the easternmost base in the Atlantic. It has unlimited value for intercepting enemy ships attempting to enter the US national defense territorial waters.

In the past four months, the enemy has lost 4.5 million people. Stalin has pointed out the importance of our country's position in his speech. Stalin has told us that the German "blitzkrieg strategy" has failed. At the same time, the enemy's attempt to isolate us has also failed. On the contrary, we have gained new allies in Britain, the United States, and other countries temporarily occupied by Germany." Regarding the point of foreign aid, Pravda said, "The aid from our allies has now become a reality. Hitler's Germany will be crushed. Long live our glorious and free motherland. March forward under the banners of Lenin and Stalin."

### Glorious Achievements of British Warships; Nine Italian Ships Destroyed; Two Italian Destroyers Also Sunk; Offensive Against the Nile River Struck

London, 10th (Reuters) – The Admiralty announced that the British fleet achieved glorious results in the central Mediterranean yesterday. According to the communique, on Saturday afternoon, British reconnaissance planes sighted a convoy of eight supply ships south of Taranto, escorted by enemy destroyers. The British cruiser HMS Ajax (520 tons), under the command of Captain Agnew, was ordered to intercept them, along with HMS Penelope (5270 tons), and the destroyers HMS Lance and HMS Leofred. At approximately 1:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, they made contact with the enemy ships and discovered another convoy of two supply ships escorted by two destroyers had joined the previously sighted large convoy and were protected by two 10,000-ton cruisers of the Trento class with 8-inch guns. Although the strength of the two sides was disparate, Captain Agnew ordered the ships to engage immediately. Before long, the enemy supply ships caught fire and nine sank, one of which was carrying ammunition and exploded as it sank. Another enemy ship, a 10,000-ton oil tanker, was also hit and caught fire. Ten hours later, the ship was still burning and is thought to have been completely destroyed by the fire. Among the Italian ships, one destroyer was sunk, and at least another one was heavily damaged. Today, another enemy destroyer was seen being towed by another ship. There were no casualties or damage to the British ships in this battle. On the way back to port, enemy planes attacked the British ships with torpedoes, but they were ineffective. After achieving this glorious victory, the ships returned to port safely. British Prime Minister Churchill has telegraphed the Admiralty to congratulate them on this important action, which seriously disrupted the enemy's supply line and hindered the enemy's operations against the Nile River.

London, 10th (Reuters) – A British naval force has won its greatest victory in the Mediterranean since the Battle of Cape Matapan.

It pursued the German battleship Bismarck, launching torpedoes at it. The ship normally had a crew of 219 men.

### Director of the Agricultural Credit Bureau, Qiao Qiming, Studies Prices; Impact on People's Lives; Rice Prices Have Increased Thirtyfold Compared to Before the War; Wage Earners Suffer the Most

Qiao Qiming, Director of the Agricultural Credit Bureau of the China Farmers Bank in Chongqing, has recently studied the impact of prices on people's lives, stating that rice prices are now 30 times higher than before the war, so landlords enjoy unearned profits. If the physical tax system is not changed, the land tax they pay is only 4% of what it was before the war. Tenant farmers, on the other hand, suffer because they pay most of their harvest as rent and rely only on spring miscellaneous grains to maintain their lives. The price increase of these crops is far less than that of rice and general goods. Exchanging these miscellaneous grains for daily necessities requires an increase of 60% or even double compared to before the war. For example, exchanging wheat for one catty of flour required 1.2 sheng before the war, but now requires 2.34 sheng. Those who profit from this are manufacturers and middlemen, whose dividends have increased fivefold compared to before the war. The people who suffer the most are wage earners. The cost of living index in June this year has risen to 1.655, while the income of university professors has only risen to 236, which is about one-seventh of the cost of living index. Laborers are better off, as their wage index can keep up with the cost of living index. Qiao Qiming taught in Chengdu for a long time and is a well-known economist.

Editorial

### Armistice Day of World War I

Today, November 11th, is the anniversary of the armistice of the previous World War. Recalling twenty-three years ago, on the Western Front of Europe, the Allied forces, after the failure of the last German offensive, launched a vigorous counterattack. After three months of hard fighting, they broke through the most formidable Hindenburg Line militarily and disintegrated various countries on the periphery of Germany politically. As a result, the Hohenzollern dynasty was overthrown, and the German side finally accepted the Allied armistice conditions, signing the armistice agreement in the famous train carriage in the Forest of Compiègne on this day in 1918, ending the unprecedented bloody battle of over four years. The impression of the people's joy and frenzy everywhere at that time is still faintly present. However, history is inevitably repeating itself, and the whole world has been dragged into the vortex of war again for two years now.

Tracing the causes of this war, there are many contributing factors, such as the uneven development of economic and political power among the great powers, the conflict in political system and ideological systems, and the lack of foresight of some authorities in the past. However, tracing the source, it cannot be denied that the main cause was the evil sown by the Treaty of Versailles. When the war had just stopped, all fair-minded people expected that Wilson's "peace without victory" would be realized, and his proposed Fourteen Points should be the most appropriate basis for the peace treaty. Unfortunately, at the Versailles Peace Conference, the ideas of revenge and selfishness dominated everything, and there was almost no room for idealism. Wilson's proposals were ridiculed and set aside. The treaty produced by the conference could not but include some grandiose clauses, such as the establishment of the League of Nations. Its main nature was destined that if the Allied powers did not permanently control Germany, the former would inevitably suffer retaliation from the latter. This unfortunate factor has been confirmed in recent years' events.

Now the whole world is shrouded in war clouds. In order to learn from the past and avoid repeating mistakes, the first thing is to seriously consider how to prevent the recurrence of past mistakes. The recent actual situation has proved that the lessons and experiences of the past twenty years have had a considerable effect. The Eight Points jointly proclaimed by Britain and the United States in August last year are one example. What is particularly important is that the idea of upholding justice and resisting aggression has taken root in people's hearts, and cannot be suppressed by any selfish or opportunistic plan. To this day, it not only forms a common belief throughout the world but has also become a common goal of the united war effort of the democratic countries. The sinful international political conspiracies and secret diplomacy of the previous war, even if not completely eliminated in the democratic camp, have been reduced to a minimum, indirectly removing the root of misfortune for the future world.

However, the result of the previous war ultimately represented a kind of progress in human history. The last remaining autocratic regimes in Europe were eliminated, and new economic and political ideals and systems began to be tested in practice. Even if international cooperation among countries resulted in more failures than successes, it still laid a preliminary foundation for future development. On this basis, it can be said that when this war ends, aggression is eliminated, justice is restored, the world and people will surely enter a new ideal realm, and various systems will be rationally transformed. Although there is still considerable time before the end of the war, and even greater and more vigorous efforts are needed to completely eliminate the stubborn evil of aggression, there is no doubt that the bright future can be absolutely trusted.

### Prelude to the Goal of World Peace

In his recent address to the labor union, President Roosevelt paid attention to the suffering of countless millions of people in the world from cold and homelessness and reiterated his determination to achieve equal enjoyment of human life after the restoration of world peace and declared that he has begun to implement this plan. At the same time, Hitler repeatedly criticized the propaganda of the democratic front, pointing out that the British were the destroyers of the world's political economy, and all the crimes of imperialism, the aggression of international capital, the panic of the social economy, and the non-righteous profits were added to the Anglo-American system. In order to promote the "good governance" of the Nazis, Hitler guaranteed to the people in the occupied areas of Europe who were not guilty of treason that they would enjoy bread, work, and all the security of life and has actively implemented this appeasement policy.

From this, we can see that the war at the front still depends on the support of peaceful economic life in the rear. In other words, what today's bloody battle at the front wants to solve is the economic life of mankind in the future; that is, if it can win the victory on the battlefield but cannot win the economic victory, it will not be able to complete its victory goal and will eventually tend to fail. This is the regret of the Treaty of Versailles of the First World War and what people today urgently want to avoid. Therefore, the meaning and responsibility of the Second World War cannot be compared with the First World War; it is also the most difficult burden of the democratic front today. What the world hopes to reap from the war is here, and the hope of all mankind for democratic countries is also here.

Therefore, the victory in the military field due to the overall cooperation of the democratic front can be expected in the near future, but the conviction of the final victory after the restoration of peace is not as strong as the former, which is due to the failure to follow up the military victory of the First World War with political and economic victories. Can the defects of the economic system of the democratic countries that Hitler criticized today be corrected appropriately? We recognize that Roosevelt will be able to implement his political propositions, but how will he realize his human life's equal enjoyment in the economic terms? These are all major premises for the goal of world peace, which must be planned and implemented in a timely manner. If we wait until after the war to solve them, we will lose the opportunity. The leaders of the democratic countries have long seen this, and the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting on the Atlantic ship will inevitably involve this fundamental issue. We can wait quietly for the proof of the facts.

Among the cooperation of the democratic front, what is most thorny is the political and economic aspects of Europe, and especially the latter is the focus. Regarding the Far East issue, some commentators often think that after the European issue has a satisfactory solution, it can be solved easily, without the need for a separate solution.

But what method will be adopted to solve the European issue? According to H.G. Wells's recent claim, its prerequisite is that the United Kingdom and the United States should cooperate thoroughly. The United States is willing to take over the British islands in the ocean as the outpost defense line, and it cannot but dispatch troops together with the United Kingdom after the war to take over the politics of the invading countries and Nazi conquered countries in the European continent to complete the previous achievements. It is also possible for the British Expeditionary Force to take over alone in Germany's original territory.

Regarding the economic system, H.G. Wells strongly advocates continuing the wartime economy and implementing the planned economy. All "public utilities," "key industries," and important raw materials should be controlled by the United Kingdom and the United States, so that people of all countries can enjoy a life of safety and freedom, and can promote the spirit of human struggle and creation, and can avoid the mutual slaughter of mankind. Some say that this method will harm national sovereignty and will be opposed by the people of various countries, and that the opposition will be even stronger in Germany. These are all worries about the sky. At present, on the European continent under Nazi rule, the people have security of life, but there is no freedom to speak of. The people led by the Anglo-American democratic spirit will surely be able to live and work in peace and jointly seek the century-old plan of human cooperation. H.G. Wells finally believes that in the future world, all countries have a relationship of mutual dependence in military, political, and economic terms, and the concept of independent and complete sovereignty will have to be revised. H.G. Wells is an important thinker today, so let's introduce him to see what happens later.

### Fierce Battles on the Moscow Front; Red Army Launches Strong Counteroffensive; Situation in the Crimean Region is Serious; Britain and the Soviet Union Jointly Defend the Caucasus

Moscow Front, 10th (TASS) – Stalin's speech has caused the soldiers on the Moscow front to intensify their fighting. In the past two days, two battalions of enemy infantry have been annihilated, and a large number of war implements have been destroyed. The enemy is still sending fresh troops to various lines at the entrance to Moscow. In the near future, the enemy will launch a major offensive.

London, 10th (United Press) – The Soviet Union reported yesterday that thousands of German troops have been annihilated in the fierce battles around Moscow. German General Annas was killed under a Soviet Zuk car. Moscow Radio broadcast official information stating that the fighting is particularly fierce in the Crimean region, where the Germans are attempting to seize Sevastopol. However, other Soviet reports indicate that the battle of Moscow is equally fierce. According to Moscow Radio, the entire German infantry division of 15,000 men at Shapkov, 55 miles south of Moscow, was destroyed. Under the command of General Minolov, the Soviet army captured the town of Vyshny Volochok and continued to advance.

London, 10th (United Press) – The situation in Crimea is serious, and there is also the threat of a German offensive against the Caucasus. Military circles here are excited about the Soviet army's excellent fighting spirit and powerful counteroffensive. However, they also strongly state that if the Soviet army fails in Crimea, the path for the Germans to re-enter the Caucasus will also be opened.

Ankara, 10th (Reuters) – According to a reliable source quoted by BBC correspondent Aglonsky, British troops will fight side by side with the Red Army to defend the Caucasus.

Berlin, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – The German Supreme Headquarters announced this afternoon that the rear of the Soviet army, which is fighting fiercely in Crimea, cannot withstand the pressure of the German-Romanian joint forces and is retreating to the east of Sevastopol and the west of Kerch. Yesterday, German forces attacked Sevastopol day and night. Oil pools and warehouses were hit and caught fire. A Soviet cruiser and a large cargo ship docked in the port were hit and severely damaged. German planes destroyed multiple railway lines and trains in the Volga River area and near Moscow. Large numbers of German planes dropped bombs and incendiary bombs on Moscow.

German Special Report Claims Capture of Tikhvin

Berlin, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – The Supreme Command issued a special report this afternoon stating that on the night of the 8th of this month, German infantry and armored vehicle units launched a surprise attack and occupied the railway junction of Tikhvin, 150 kilometers east of Leningrad, capturing many prisoners and seizing countless military equipment. Senior staff officers of the Soviet 4th Army barely escaped. Abandoning important military writings.

### Red Army Grand Review in Kuybyshev; Impressive Formation; New Recruits Participate in Drill

Kuybyshev, 10th (Reuters) – The Red Army did not suffer from the cold wind during the revolutionary anniversary parade held here. This is a different kind of parade from the usual parade, so its impression is particularly moving. The troops marched through Kuybyshev Square for about two hours. Participating in the parade were infantry units armed with new automatic weapons, machine gun units, artillery units towed by horses and trucks, armored vehicle units with anti-aircraft guns, and light and heavy tank units. About 50 fighter planes flew in formation overhead. New recruits from training camps also participated in the drill in black uniforms, and their movements were also very orderly. The overall military appearance was excellent. The Red Army soldiers talked and laughed during the break. Large teams of factory workers also carried flags. When Voroshilov inspected the teams before giving his speech, the Red Army cheered to welcome him. Standing with Voroshilov were government officials such as Kalinin and Vyshinsky.

### Voroshilov's Full Speech

TASS, Kubyshev, 10th: Marshal of the Soviet Union Voroshilov delivered the following speech here on the 7th during a Red Army parade: Comrades, Red Army soldiers, commanders, political instructors, and armed comrades from all industrial, agricultural, and cultural sectors! I am instructed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government to extend my congratulations to all of you on the 24th anniversary of the Socialist October Revolution. Today, as we welcome the 24th anniversary of our glorious history, our motherland is at war, and the Soviet people are defending their lives, independence, and honor against the perfidious invasion of German fascism. The Red Army and Navy, from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, have been fighting the German fascists and the armies of Hitler's protectorates, Finland, Italy, Hungary, and Romania, for four months. In this war, countless soldiers, generals, commanders, political instructors, and other Red Army and Navy fighters have

heroically fallen on the battlefield.

Today, on our national day, we bow our heads in remembrance. Red Army soldiers, generals, commanders, political instructors, and all armed personnel are fighting bravely on all fronts under the leadership of our great Stalin. The defenders of Leningrad are displaying outstanding courage. Tens of thousands of enemy corpses have piled up at the entrance to Leningrad, suffocated by their own black blood. The enemy there has been forced to switch from offense to defense. Kiev, Odessa, and other cities in our country have also shown boundless courage and heroism. The enemy has paid a heavy price for their temporary victories. Currently, the enemy is exerting all their strength to attack Moscow, attempting to occupy our capital. Hitler is sacrificing the blood of his German slaves, driving tens of thousands of soldiers towards our barbed wire, trenches, machine guns, cannons, and tanks. The lesson Hitler received in Leningrad is not enough. He is now receiving the same cruel lesson in Moscow. In Moscow, Hitler will not only break his teeth, but his spine will also be shattered. When Hitler planned his perfidious attack on the Soviet Union, he did not expect the Red Army to inflict upon them the

powerful setbacks

they have already received.

The easy victories of the German fascists in Europe made Hitler dream that he could easily defeat the Red Army. His basis was: 1. A sudden, perfidious attack on the Red Army. 2. The German fascist army was fully mobilized and united due to the war. After looting Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Yugoslavia, and Greece, a large amount of military equipment was available for the German army's use. A fully armed murderer launching a sudden attack from behind usually has an advantage over the attacked. However, this time Hitler stretched his reach too far, and his calculations were extremely wrong. Hitler promised the German people an easy victory, but in reality, it has become a terrible bloodbath for the fascists. The fascists have never seen anything like this, and the result will be their destruction. The "future paradise" touted by the German propaganda machine is now filled with fascist corpses. Our compatriots in the temporarily occupied areas of Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, and Karelia have organized guerrilla units to fight against their invaders. Their activities are expanding daily. Currently, guerrilla warfare has made it impossible for the German fascists in the occupied areas to live peacefully or engage in looting. The guerrillas are like a

nightmare

to the German rear.

However, guerrilla warfare is still in its initial stage. In the future, it will develop into a deadly battle against the invaders. Since the German fascists cannot stop their military adventure halfway, they continue to send fresh troops into the war. We must destroy these thugs, leaving not a single one alive. This is our greatest and most sacred duty. We are defending our motherland, our homes, and our future. No matter how large the enemy's numbers, we must fight until all the fascists are destroyed. Hitler and his fascist generals believe that the strength of the Soviet military and civilians is nearly exhausted. The fascists believe that the day when they can enter the "paradise" to loot and kill, replacing it with "superior fascist culture," is near. But they are mistaken. The Soviet state's reserve strength is still enormous, more than enough to fight until not a single fascist remains. However, the Red Army, the Navy, and all Soviet people must further strengthen their will, further develop the quality of military equipment, make the use of various electrical devices more perfect, and pay more attention to the details of military operations, because this will determine the victory of the war. In the war against German and Italian fascist imperialism, the Soviet Union is currently the

central military force

in the united front of enslaved Slavic peoples and freedom-loving people of Europe.

The day when the Slavic people, such as the Yugoslavs, rise up united to resist the invaders and sweep them away is near. The Red Army, Navy, and Air Force, in a united war with the British Army and Navy and other freedom-loving countries, enjoy the active assistance of the great democratic nation, the United States. The United States will continue to fight until German and Italian imperialism are completely destroyed. The disaster that endangers all people worldwide must and will be destroyed. Comrades, war is a great misfortune. War destroys the achievements of the people's hard work in peacetime. Therefore, we must work together to reduce the disruption to life. The war will definitely be protracted, cruel, and fierce. Therefore, we need the unwavering will and utmost effort of the entire working population, and heroic soldiers, to fight with blood for the life of the motherland and the future of our descendants. We must fully supply the front lines with materials. In this great war, Soviet women are working in the rear and at the front, displaying heroism like Soviet men. Countless women have joined industry, but the number must be increased further. Women must replace men in their work, because they are needed everywhere. The working masses of the Soviet Union, including industrial and agricultural workers, must redouble their efforts and increase their work rate in order to

defeat the enemy sooner.

Long live the 24th anniversary of the October Revolution! Long live the heroic Red Army and Navy! Long live the Soviet people! Long live the Lenin-Stalin Party!

### Benevolent Actions by the Two Concessions Bring Rice Prices Back on Track; Citizens Are Delighted and Rice Shops Are Busy; Officials Have Done Two Big Things but Still Lack the Middle Part

The actions taken by the Public Works Department yesterday regarding the rice market have the character of King Wei of Qi, who does not soar until he soars, and does not speak until he startles everyone. The rice market was immediately stabilized, and the people's hearts were greatly relieved. This is its greatest success. However, the shortcoming lies in the fact that two things have been done, but the middle part is still lacking. Therefore, in front of many rice shops yesterday, there were many neatly dressed people crowding together to buy a dou of rice. As a result, although there was widespread selling, the momentum of crowding could not be completely eliminated. From morning to night, apart from rice shops saying they had no rice, the rice shop officials suffered a lot. In the past, selling five dou of rice only required one procedure, but now it requires five procedures. It is inevitably hard work, but it can be considered as fulfilling a slight obligation to the public. However, it is slightly better than the rise and fall of prices, and it is inevitable that there will be more hidden losses. Fortunately, the rice shops are all experts, and they think they will not make the weight inaccurate, and they will not suffer losses themselves. If they can get through it, that's it. However, if this continues, it is inevitable that there will be passive resistance and secret sabotage, which should be paid attention to. Secondly, the hoarders and the bank loaners have suffered, but this is not to be regretted. Hoarding medicines to kill people is the same kind of retribution.

Yesterday, the authorities of the light southern concession of foreign rice restricted the maximum price of each bag to be no more than 158.5 yuan, and the maximum price of each shi to be no more than 130 yuan. The turbulent situation of manipulation and monopoly in the past few weeks has been clarified by this action. However, those who have already made agreements but have not yet concluded them have also had disputes because of this. Those who hold the goods are mostly unwilling to sell them cheaply, and the importers will definitely only buy them within the price limit. The transaction has to be stopped. The industry is currently meeting to discuss solutions in order to continue business.

### Foreign Vermicelli and Grains; Hoarders Are Cautious

The source of bean oil continues to come to Shanghai. The foreign vermicelli market has been affected by the restriction of foreign rice. Fearing that foreign vermicelli will also be subject to the same treatment, holders are trying to sell, but the actual sales have to be maintained, and customers dare not ask. The market has also stagnated invisibly. The initial asking price for Golden Dragon brand was 47 yuan, then 45 yuan, but there were no buyers. At 45 yuan, it is already 8 or 9 yuan lower than the 53 or 54 yuan at the end of last week. Wheat has also softened. The factory's door price is 75 yuan, and a small number of purchases have been made. Hoarders of miscellaneous grains are gradually worried because of the rice market. Therefore, the market is weak, and edible oil and corn have fallen by 5 to 10 yuan. The future still has a tendency to continue to fall. However, soybean cake is still firm. Dalian soybean oil and Qingdao raw oil are both 380 yuan, Jiangbei raw oil is 360 yuan, Dayou factory clear oil is 270 yuan, and Yoshida and paint factory vegetable oil are both 265 yuan. Dutch yellow corn is 43 or 44 yuan, white corn is 42 or 43 yuan, and Saigon old corn is 42 yuan, and new corn is 52 yuan. Yuanlong soybean cake is 27 yuan. Today, there are 3,900 bags of beans and 1,016 bags of raw oil, all transported from Tianjin.

### The Struggle for Gold Is Still Fierce; The 20,000 Yuan Mark Was Entered and Exited Twice

Yesterday, the spot gold market was in a state of hovering. It started to rise, then suddenly plummeted, and then recovered slightly. The 20,000 yuan mark was broken into and out of twice. Everyone's hearts were very distracted. The struggle between supply and demand was quite fierce. Initially, following the trend of the end of last week, it rose to 21,300 yuan, but soon Hong Kong gangs Wei Xiang and Xiangxing Yongshi and Li sold, and Tianyuan and Decheng also competed to sell, so it fell. In the afternoon, it retreated to a low price of 19,850 yuan. Unexpectedly, a few banks suddenly made a strong advance by Dafeng Defu (a total of more than 3,000 taels were imported throughout the day), and finally recovered slightly, closing at 550 yuan. The total transaction for the day was 15,660 taels. Gold jewelry fell by 50 yuan to 1,070 yuan. The black market for silver has fallen below the listed price of 28 yuan to 26.5 yuan.

Spot goods fluctuate greatly.

In the early morning, the spot market was shrouded in buying, and the market price rose. The market opened at 9 o'clock and rose to 21,200 yuan, 350 yuan higher than the closing price in Shanghai last Saturday. Then, Decheng, Tianyuan, Mingfeng, and Dafeng bought in, raising it to 21,300 yuan. The Hong Kong gangs suddenly sold out. Xianghe, Shihe, Xiangxing, and Yongdai sold hard. Hesheng, Tianyuan, Hengji, and Shunyuan also had strong intentions to sell. The market price plummeted, falling into 21,000 yuan, falling more sharply, and falling by 950 yuan to 20,350 yuan. After 10:40, Xiangxing, Yongtian Yuan, and Defeng resumed their advance. Decheng and Dafeng also bought in, raising it to 20,700 yuan. Xiangxing, Yongtian Yuan, and Junlai sold hard, Jinbang Yifeng and Yongcheng Xianghe also dumped, plunging 530 yuan, losing to 20,170 yuan. Dafeng Ming made a strong advance to 20,500 yuan. Shunyuan, Chengda Hengji, and Yixiang and advanced again, retreating to 20,115 yuan. The closing price in the afternoon was 20,161 yuan. The market opened 50 yuan lower in the afternoon, at 10,100 yuan. Shunyuan and Xianghe sold hard, continuing to drop 250 yuan, retreating into 20,000 yuan, losing to 19,851 yuan. Defu Decheng Chengji made a strong advance, raising it to 12,200 yuan. Dingsheng Xiangxing, Yongtian Yiyuan, Xianghe, and Decheng Yongcheng sold, pushing it down to 19,900 yuan. Dafeng Defu made a huge advance, Tianyuan Gonghe Deda, etc. made a strong advance, and the price gradually rose by 450 yuan, rising to 20,350 yuan. At that time, Tianyuan sold out, and the closing price was 20,300 yuan, which was 550 yuan lower than the closing price last Saturday afternoon. After the closing, it rose to 20,400 yuan. The whole day had a difference of 1,450 yuan. The market price of the company's gold was 20,500 yuan, and the purchase price was about 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.

Jewelry and silver fell together.

The exchange price of silver jewelry in the morning was 70 yuan lower twice, at 2,050 yuan, and in the afternoon, it rose by 20 yuan and hung up again, at 2,070 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by 150 yuan), closing at 50 yuan. Silver still hung at 28 yuan, but the black market was as low as 26.5 yuan.

### The Need for the Black Market Is Not Strong

The foreign exchange market yesterday, the exchange rates of HSBC and Central did not change. The exchange rates of British and American small counters were fixed. The British and American exchange rates in the black market were still stable. A certain Chinese merchant speculator sold American exchange and still raised the price by 2.75 yuan, and some even shouted only 2.625 yuan. Importers are not in a hurry, because the daily price is too expensive. Therefore, the buyer's counter-offer is still around 3 yuan, and the trend is soft. The British gold and silver businesses cannot necessarily close. The trend was more stable in the afternoon. There were still no transactions at 4 o'clock. The closing price of British exchange was 2 pennies, and the closing price of American exchange was 3 yuan, which seemed to be slightly softer than the price last Saturday.

Hong Kong, 10th (Monday): The exchange market opened smoothly this morning, and there were no changes in any exchange rates.

Tianjin, 10th (Monday): The exchange market opened flat this morning. The London telegraphic transfer was extended by 1.25 to 2 pennies 1.25. The New York telegraphic transfer was also loosened by 25 to 3.5 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 2 yuan to 80 yuan. The "Joint Note" dark market cheapened by 5 corners to 39.5 corners.

### Foreign Currencies Decline Uniformly

Yesterday's foreign currency market, British and American gold pounds fell by 10 yuan each along with the cash price. British gold bills gradually stabilized, and the market price stabilized. The American gold bill once retreated to 38.5 yuan, and the final price was 38.8 yuan, which was 9 corners lower than last week. Hong Kong transparent bills continued to decline, and the evening market retreated to 8 yuan. Japanese gold bills and Korean bills fell sharply, both retreating to 3.9 yuan.

### Rumors Are Negative; Cotton Yarn Hits the Limit

The yarn market turned downwards, and the decline intensified. This was due to the rumor that the U.S. military might withdraw, which made people feel weak, and the shorts were active. Sellers came again enthusiastically, so the market followed downwards. As for spot yarn trading, in view of the decline in futures, the momentum was weakened. The 20-count Shuangma factory single opened in the morning at 2,950 yuan, down 60 yuan from the previous day. After a while, it rose to 3,015 yuan. However, the exchange's futures yarn has resumed operation. After the standard yarn opened and rose, the second session turned down. As for the fact that Shuangma factory single miscellaneous brands can also be used for delivery, the market price softened, and the sellers increased, so it fell to 2,900 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, due to various rumors, all of which were negative, the decline was even stronger. The opening price was 2,880 yuan, and it fell straight to 2,790 yuan, announcing the limit down. It is estimated that the turnover in half a day was about 3,000 bales. Spot yarn also fell by 7, 8, or 10 yuan.

Jinshuangma futures market situation, the agricultural opening is not strong, and the market atmosphere is very dull. November was 2,850 yuan, down 60 yuan, December was 3,030 yuan, also down 35 yuan, and January was 3,70 yuan, closing down 50 yuan. After entering, with the gold market and factory orders rising once, the futures yarn also rose by 5 to 40 yuan. Then, various parties increased their selling pressure, and the selling momentum was strong again, so it fell straight down, and the closing price in the afternoon was 100 to 156 yuan lower. In the afternoon, people were panicking and becoming more and more tired. The first session opened with a disastrous limit down, with each month falling by more than 200 yuan. Its trend is in a fiery atmosphere, or it will take a revolving path. The list is shown below:

Month Nov Dec Jan Opening 280.0 300.0 3070.0 Highest 2890.0 3039.0 3070.0 Lowest 2710.0 2865.0 2920.0 Closing 2710.0 2865.0 1910.0 Compared to Fall 200.0 Fall 200.0 Fall 200.0

### Why Bother With Public Bonds; It's Just Useless Worry

Foreign stocks fell as expected. Public bonds in the dark market, yesterday's market was greatly affected by the rumors that the U.S. military would withdraw from Shanghai. The difference between the highest and lowest prices was as much as 1.56 yuan. The difference in Ding Zhong was even greater because of the lottery, which was nothing more than the shorts taking advantage of the opportunity to put pressure on prices to achieve their profits. Therefore, the opening price of Bing Zhong in the early morning was only 64 yuan, but this unacceptable price immediately caused a large number of purchases. The second price rose by more than half a yuan, and then broke through 5 yuan, which shows that people's hearts are unusually distracted, and it is difficult to grasp the rise and fall. Although the situation between Japan and the United States is extremely bad, no one can make a definite statement in these few days. Is it dark or bright? It will be clear in the near future. But since there is no problem with the fundamentals of public bonds, why bother with useless worries? In the morning, Yichang first opened the market for Bing Zhong at 4 yuan, and Tongshun Jiufeng took the opportunity to absorb it. Soon, it broke through 5 yuan. Xiexing Yuan and Renfeng also made large-scale replenishments. Senji Tongkang Yitai provided the supply. The market price was slightly less than a few corners as a result of the afternoon closing. In the afternoon, Tongshun Hongda Xiexing Yuan bought in, and Zhong Hu Heji Yitai Delong sold out. The market price has always been outside of 5 yuan, revolving with strength, and the result is slightly stronger than the afternoon closing.

Domestically Produced Raincoat Fabric Is Popular

Raincoat fabric is selling well in Shanghai. All of them are due to the high prices, and the incoming raincoat fabric is expensive and in short supply, which has created a good opportunity for the popular sale of domestically produced raincoat fabric. Among the domestically produced raincoat materials, the most popular one is rainproof fabric, followed by double and single-layer adhesive yarn surfaces. Rongchang Defeilong brand yarn surface rain fabric is the most famous. The wholesale price of adhesive is 9.5 yuan per yard, and the wholesale price of single adhesive is 8.25 yuan per yard. Yousheng Jinxiong Lao brand rainproof fabric is the most popular, because it is light and does not leak water, firm and soft, not hard and heavy, has no glue odor and soda, and has recently added a trademark. All old clothes can be repaired and re-glued with the mark, and only a handling fee of 5 yuan is charged, so the reputation is more solid, and the number of seekers is even greater. The price remains stable, and it only sells for 8 yuan net. However, its products are getting better and better, and it will rise again to reach 10 yuan in the future.

### Stringent Rice Price Controls Implemented with Great Success Yesterday; Market Speculation Eliminated; Numerous Cases of Smuggling and Hiding Rice Discovered

Rice warehouses guarded by merchant corps to prevent relocation. Territorial authorities approved land regulations, including details regarding salaries and supplies, on the 4th, authorizing the Shanghai Municipal Council to formulate regulations for managing commodity prices in the city. After a meeting on the 9th, it was decided to begin managing commodity prices in the city, starting with rice. Subsequently, the implementation of various robust measures was announced, commencing from dawn. Following this, the management of prices for other essential commodities, such as flour and cooking oil, would be announced sequentially. This blitz-like action has already achieved remarkable results yesterday. The price of rice at all rice shops and stalls throughout the city is capped at a maximum of $130. Rice merchants can no longer obtain illegal profits. Rice stored in various warehouses cannot be moved without permission. Rice market speculation has been completely eliminated. Prices of various coarse grains and bean oil have fallen uniformly. The Merchant Corps mobilized to guard the warehouses. The International Volunteer Corps' "O" Company was dispatched at 5:00 PM yesterday to the area north of the Suzhou Creek, where rice warehouses congregate. Armed merchant corps members were stationed at each warehouse and storage facility containing rice, preventing relocation and assisting the police authorities. From 5:00 PM yesterday to 5:00 AM this morning, "A" Company took over. It is understood that this measure by the authorities is intended to forcibly sell stockpiled rice on the market when necessary, to stabilize the food supply. To prevent rice profiteers from inciting unrest, all national contingents of the International Volunteer Corps, except the Japanese contingent, are on standby.

Rewards Offered for Reporting Hoarding

The authorities of both concessions hope that the public will cooperate closely with the emergency measures taken by the authorities. Retail purchases are still limited to one dou (eight kilograms), and intentional over-purchasing is prohibited to avoid penalties. The authorities earnestly request that residents within the concessions report any stockpiles of rice, including the names of the property owners. If the reports are verified, it is said that a certain amount of reward money will be given. According to an announcement from the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office, the council welcomes citizens to report any cases of profiteering or hoarding of various goods subject to price controls announced by the council. Reports should be submitted in writing, with supporting evidence, and sent to Room 171, Price Control Office, Shanghai Municipal Council Office, 209 Jiangxi Road.

Municipal Council Sets Up Office

The Shanghai Municipal Council established a foreign rice office on the third floor of the Union Building on Fuzhou Road, starting at 9:00 AM yesterday. Numerous male and female staff members are assigned to manage the following matters separately: purchasing foreign rice for taxpayers in the Western Extra-Settlement Roads area; purchasing foreign rice for factories and companies; purchasing foreign rice for hospitals and schools; warehouse receipts; and rice transportation permits. The procedures for applying to purchase foreign rice at the office are as follows: an application form must be filled out and submitted to a staff member; after the application form is approved, it should be sent to the table marked "Shanghai Municipal Council Cashier", along with the cash payment; after payment, the application form should be sent to the table marked "Warehouse Receipts" to exchange for a warehouse receipt; after receiving the warehouse receipt, it should be sent to the counter marked "Police Department Rice Transportation Permit" to obtain a rice transportation permit; carry the warehouse receipt and rice transportation permit to the location indicated on the warehouse receipt to collect the rice. There are also several footnotes to supplement the above: the rice transportation permit must be kept; it must be shown to the patrol officers during transportation; lost warehouse receipts or rice transportation permits will not be reissued; purchases of foreign rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council must be made in cash, without exception. The office has approximately 30 staff members, overseen by Mr. Bence, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and is under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council Rice Grain Sub-Committee. The members of the committee are Messrs. Cronk, Powell, Hanawa, Macmillan, and Shanghai Municipal Council officials Ferry, Peterson, and Bence. It is reported that 1,500 people registered and 700 telephone inquiries were received, with 200 people making direct inquiries.

Inspections Find Hidden Rice; Numerous Arrests Made

Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department dispatched a large number of detectives in dozens of teams to intercept illegally transported rice on the streets. As a result, the total number of packages intercepted in both concessions yesterday reached over 200. The French Concession, particularly the McTyeire Police Station, made the most interceptions. In the International Settlement, some rice shops were found to be attempting to secretly transport rice to residents' homes. After the police station learned of this, they searched the homes and seized a considerable amount of rice. It is also reported that some rice shop employees have been arrested. The seized rice is said to be sold to citizens by the police station at a fair price. Yesterday, a reporter from Daguang News Agency, while passing through North Zhejiang Road, saw that the rice shop next to the Nanyang Soap Factory outlet at the intersection of North Suzhou Road had hidden all its foreign and domestic rice and was selling Saigon broken rice instead. This is a clear violation of the regulations of the concession authorities and is a case of lip service but disobedience. It is reported that the authorities of both concessions, fearing that rice profiteers would not comply with the law and sell their stockpiled rice as much as possible, have specially dispatched undercover detectives to conduct on-site investigations in various districts. Any illegal behavior will be dealt with in accordance with orders, including being ordered to close down or deported. It is reported that yesterday, several rice shops, including Xingtai on Great Race Course Road, were found to be attempting to secretly transport stockpiled rice to other locations for profit. The owners of these shops were taken to the police station for investigation and punishment according to the law.

Rice Shops Should Promptly Announce Sources

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that all retail rice shops should post a notice at their entrances stating the names of the usual wholesale suppliers of rice, indicating from where each rice shop obtains its rice. According to a statement from the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office regarding the purchase of foreign rice from the council, all those who have previously submitted applications to the council requesting foreign rice should take note that the council cannot make a decision on these applications at present because they have not provided the detailed information required by the council. As for residents in the Extra-Settlement Roads area of Western Shanghai, as well as factories, companies, schools, and institutions within the concessions who wish to purchase foreign rice, they should send representatives to Room 703 of the council office to fill out an application form. The current price of Shanghai Municipal Council foreign rice is $165.10 per bag, and payment must be made in cash. Checks will not be accepted.

Are Domestic Rice Prices Limited and Transportation Prohibited?

Regarding the new measures of the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association concerning the Municipal Council's management of rice, because the council's notice did not mention whether domestic rice prices would be limited or transportation prohibited, three members, Zhang Nianxuan, Qu Zhenhua, and Shi Hongxun, were specially delegated to visit Deputy Director Ho of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday afternoon to request a statement from the council. Mr. Ho personally received them and agreed to find a solution. The representatives were very satisfied and left. They also reported to the members on the calm state of affairs.

Rice Industry Loses Over 50 Million

After the Shanghai Municipal Council issued a notice announcing the unified control of rice, the rice industry in the city suffered losses of 50 to 70 million yuan within 24 hours. This figure is calculated from the previous day's rice prices and the amount of rice in storage, and it is still a conservative estimate. The rice controlled by the rice industry involves over one million bags, purchased at prices ranging from $160 to $200 per shi (unit of dry measure). Now, they can only sell it at the Shanghai Municipal Council's stipulated price of $130 per shi. An official from the Shanghai Municipal Council stated that as a result of the council's actions,

The Bureau is Fully Prepared

If many rice shops close down, the public should not feel alarmed. The bureau has a sufficient supply of rice to meet the needs of the city. In addition, the bureau has a large quantity of foreign rice that can be transported from Hong Kong and Rangoon in the short term. The bureau is currently procuring rice from other places. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council will soon take the same control measures for other daily necessities, such as flour, grains, and cooking oil. The Shanghai International Volunteer Corps mobilized today to assist the police. It is reported that they will be deployed at any time to prevent any disturbances that may arise due to the Municipal Council's management of rice. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Council has begun to find ways to control the price of flour in the city and is currently discussing methods to implement them within a few days. It is reported that the Importers Association, sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Council, has prepared a detailed plan for its operations, which will be completed soon, in order to control the soaring retail prices and hoarding activities.

Collective Purchase and Unified Distribution of Rice. Yesterday, rice carts on various roads were frequently stopped and inspected. Those exceeding the limit were confiscated. The rice confiscated will be sold fairly. To facilitate the purchase of rice for residents, the authorities will establish a rice distribution agency to be responsible for distributing rice to stores or factories with a large number of employees for sale, so as to manage and prevent private transportation and hoarding under the pretext of collective purchases by guilds or organizations.

### Two Batches of Foreign Flour Ordered; To Be Sold at Fair Prices; The Municipal Council is Fully Prepared for the Supply of Fair-Priced Flour

The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office issued a public announcement stating that there are rumors circulating that the meeting of flour wholesalers convened by the council on the 10th of this month did not yield results. The council specifically announced that it is now fully prepared to resolve the issue of supplying fair-priced flour in Shanghai. The council has now placed large orders for two batches of foreign flour and is confident that various difficulties can be overcome. At the same time, the Equalization Fund Committee has also assisted the council in providing foreign exchange for the supply of flour. It is hoped that more good news can be obtained after the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council returns to Shanghai from Hong Kong.

### Hoarding of Liquid Fuels Prohibited and Punished; Fire Department Hopes for Public Assistance in Investigation

The Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Department, in view of the large number of illegal hoarders of kerosene, gasoline, and other dangerous liquids in Shanghai, which pose a serious fire hazard, has been making efforts to reduce the danger to life and property caused by such excessive hoarding. The department has repeatedly dispatched personnel to inspect places reported or suspected of storing such liquids and, after inspection, has sent letters of guidance or warning. When necessary, the department has filed lawsuits with the court to punish hoarders. According to the department's announcement, in the past three months, the following cases of storing various dangerous goods have been prosecuted:

For kerosene, personnel were dispatched for 76 inspections. 19 places were verbally warned, and written warnings were also required. 11 of them did not comply and were sued in court and charged with storing illegal items in violation of Article 35 of the Land Regulations and By-laws. As a result, all were convicted and fined between $20 and $25. For ethyl alcohol, the Fire Department must deal with the most volatile and dangerous substance, so the department decided to make every effort to close these factories. In July, August, and mid-September, the department inspected 13 ethyl alcohol factories that had already been identified. Several of them stopped work after being warned, but three did not follow the instructions. They were sued and fined, and the court ordered them to close down. For gasoline, there are two storage locations that have been investigated. Personnel were sent to inspect them, and one of them was sued and fined. In addition to the above-mentioned dangerous liquids, the use of celluloid in small hair comb, button, ornament, and bottle cap factories also kept the Fire Department busy. Most of these factories stopped work after receiving warnings. In the past three months, a total of 18 inspections were made on various factories, and four were given written warnings, ordering them to stop work. Three of them did not comply and were convicted by the court. Reports on the illegal storage of dangerous goods are welcomed by the Fire Department. The department also hopes that the public will report any known violations to help the department eliminate fire hazards.

### All Police Officers Mobilized; Searches Conducted Based on Reports

It is understood that the Shanghai Municipal Council is now mobilizing all police officers to prevent fires within the concession. A special team has been organized and is ready to work with the Fire Department and the Public Works Department to search places reported to contain flammable materials based on the reports received. It is reported that in two days, 12 places where flammable materials were found were confiscated. A large quantity of kerosene, candles, and matches were found in one place. Mr. Chen, the owner of a tobacco shop at 347 Fuzhou Road, was found to have stored a large quantity of flammable materials and was arrested. It is reported that in recent days, a total of 250 cans of kerosene, 100 boxes of matches, and 900 boxes of candles have been seized. The matches were stored on wooden racks that are easy to ignite, and a large quantity of kerosene was piled up underneath. According to current regulations, each household is only allowed to store 10 cans of 5-gallon kerosene. Any amount exceeding this must be stored in a specially licensed warehouse. The owner of the tobacco shop will be sent to the First Special District Court and charged with storing dangerous goods and endangering public life and property. The Shanghai Municipal Council stated that it hopes for public assistance and requests that any discovery of dangerous goods being stored be reported immediately.

### Grand Celebration of U.S. Marine Corps Birthday; Speeches by Glassford and Standen; Fourth Regiment Stationed in Shanghai for 15 Years

Yesterday (the 10th), the Fourth Marine Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai celebrated the 166th anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Marine Corps. At 9:00 AM, the regiment held races and other competitions at the American School playground, with 20 events. Prizes were awarded after the competition.

Reception Held by the American Club

From 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM, the regiment held a reception at the American Club. Commander Colonel Howard cut the birthday cake. Before the cake cutting, the officers of the regiment lined up to present the national flag. Rear Admiral Glassford and Mr. Standen, representative of U.S. Consul General Lockhart, delivered speeches at the reception, which were broadcast by the Greater Shanghai and China-America radio stations from 6:45 PM to 7:00 PM. Last Saturday night, the U.S. military held a birthday dance at the YMCA gymnasium in Western Shanghai, with music played by the Fourth Regiment's military band. U.S. soldiers led their friends to participate, and the atmosphere was very lively.

Protecting Overseas Merchants for Over a Century

The U.S. Marine Corps has been responsible for protecting the nationals, property, and commercial interests of the U.S. outside the American continent for over a century. The Fourth Regiment of the Marine Corps, since its formation on April 16, 1914, has been responsible for protecting overseas expatriates, which is more important than other regiments. It was first stationed in Mexico and Santo Domingo. In January 1927, the Fourth Regiment was ordered to be stationed in China. On February 24 of the same year, the regiment sailed into the Shanghai Mobil Oil Company dock on the Jia Meng ship. It was not until March 21 that the regiment moved into eight barracks in the International Settlement to carry out protection work together with foreign troops and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. At that time, the U.S. Marine Corps Third Brigade was established in Tianjin, and the Fourth Regiment was incorporated into the brigade. The Second Battalion departed from San Diego on April 12, 1927, and was stationed in Tianjin, becoming part of the Twelfth Regiment. On January 29, 1929, the Third Brigade was disbanded, and all the U.S. troops, except the Fourth Regiment, returned to the U.S. in February of the following year. The Fourth Regiment was then formed by merging two battalions.

A Brigade Added During the Shanghai Battle

In December 1937, the Shanghai Battle broke out. At the request of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Second Brigade of the U.S. Marine Corps came to Shanghai to increase defense. The Fourth Regiment was incorporated into the brigade. On February 18 of the following year, the Second Brigade, together with the Sixth Regiment and the Anti-Aircraft Artillery, withdrew from China, leaving only the Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai to protect U.S. expatriates and property in difficult circumstances.

### Parks Crowded with Visitors

The autumn weather is clear and refreshing, and chrysanthemums are in full bloom. Various parks in the two concessions have been decorated with chrysanthemums of various colors, embellishing the scenery. Therefore, the parks are very crowded with visitors. The tea room in the Bund Park also has exquisite lunches and snacks, with six dishes for 4 yuan per person. It is cheap and beautiful. Why not drink and enjoy the chrysanthemums?

### Christian Expanded Evangelistic Week

Since the outbreak of the war, the population of this city has grown to five or six million, and a considerable number of Christians have also come here from other places to seek refuge. In total, there are no fewer than twenty thousand. Non-Christians account for 97 percent, which is similar to the situation between the ancient Roman Empire and the Christians of the first century in European history. Now, because outstanding Taoist masters have returned from overseas one after another, various church groups, seeing the rampant speculation, widespread evil, and insatiable greed, with the wealth of these people increasing daily as they indulge in extravagance and debauchery with their ill-gotten gains, while the salaried class is struggling on the brink of death under economic oppression, and the people are drowning in misery to such an extreme, in order to save the world and spread the Gospel, the Shanghai Christian Evangelistic Group, the Shanghai Christian Missionary Association, the Shanghai Christian Endeavor Society, Bethel Theological Seminary, and the Gan's Holy Apostles' College have jointly launched an expanded evangelistic week in Shanghai. First, an executive committee was organized, and Rev. Zhu Guishen, Zhu Chonghua, Yu Zhizhai, Tang Renxi, Ji Zhiwen, and Lin Daoliang, as well as Mr. Le Junying, were elected as chairman and vice-chairman of the committee. General affairs, literature, economy, evangelism, and inspection groups were established, with staff responsible for preparations and implementation. Since the first meeting was convened on October 15, a discussion meeting on the program of the great evangelistic week has been held every Wednesday afternoon at 5 o'clock at Moore Memorial Church. The following items have been decided:

The evangelistic locations are divided into four places: Moore Memorial Church on Nanchang Road, Tian'an Church on Shandong Road, St. Paul's Church in the Foreign Cemetery on Sanma Road, and the Chinese Christian Church on Kangtuo Road, which are open to the public.

The dates and times for evangelism have been set from November 10 (Monday) to the 16th, for a total of one week, from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM every night. At the same time, evangelists will also broadcast sermons on the Gospel Radio Station.

Speakers: The original speakers for this expanded evangelistic week were Rev. Ji Zhiwen, Zhao Shiguang, Qi Qingcai, and Lin Daoliang. However, Rev. Ji and Lin have recently returned from the United States, and Rev. Zhao has also returned to Shanghai from Java in Southeast Asia. Now Rev. Zhao has gone to Hong Kong to preach, and Rev. Qi must go to Hao County in Anhui Province on the 11th to lead a revival meeting. Therefore, the evangelism group had to redistribute the speakers. Rev. Lin Daoliang will speak at Tian'an Church, Rev. Gu Lisi and Mr. Zhang Jianguo, who have returned to Shanghai from the inland and the Philippines, will be specially invited to speak at St. Paul's Church, Rev. Wang Feixiang and Mr. Qian Tuyun will speak at the Chinese Christian Church, and members of the [missing word] Workers' Society will speak on the 5th. Rev. Zhao can rush back on the 6th and 7th days and will be invited to speak.

Distributing tracts: A total of 140,000 tracts will be distributed, with 30,000 donated by the Bethel Church. The remaining 110,000 have been rushed to the printers. The words are simple and clear, and the front is a specially compiled hymn. The members of the evangelistic group are responsible for the distribution. On the 15th, male and female students from various church schools will be responsible for distribution. Approximately, members of the evangelistic group will distribute these tracts on trams, buses, and major roads starting from the 10th.

Publishing cover advertisements: The intention is to make all newspaper readers in the city aware that the Christian Church is holding a great evangelistic event. The cost of cover advertisements is very high, requiring several thousand yuan per day. However, the "News Daily" has been donated by the youth fellowship of Tian'an Church, and the "Shen Bao" has been donated by a pharmacist from a certain pharmaceutical factory. Other enthusiastic believers have also contributed to publishing in the "China-U.S. Daily" and other newspapers. He Ming Shoe and Hat Store has even donated a movie advertisement.

Bible verses: These are divided into four types. The largest type will be posted on the windows of buses and major stores, the second type will be posted on trams in the Public Concession, and the third and fourth types can be posted on private cars and chartered cars. These slogans are decorated with a cross and very clear Bible verses, which are colorful and beautiful. This initiative is due to the promotion of Dr. Minsde, the American director of the Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and also thanks to the sponsorship of the Public Concession Tram and Bus Company, which is not charging a penny. It is said that tens of thousands of copies of these slogans, large and small, have been printed, which is a huge expense.

Gospel car: During the evangelistic week, it is planned to parade the Public Concession with the car, which will be decorated with large white flags and pasted with slogans. There will be a choir and a band in the car. When it arrives in bustling urban areas, they will get out of the car to distribute tracts. When the car starts, the choir will sing hymns and the band will play music. It is also planned to rent a large car in the French Concession and hold the same event.

Reception and loudspeaker arrangements: Tian'an Church, St. Paul's Church, and the Chinese Christian Church will be taken care of by the pastors of each church, and enthusiastic believers will serve as ushers. The [missing word] Workers' Society will send people to serve as ushers at Moore Memorial Church. Loudspeakers will be specially installed at Moore Memorial Church and the Chinese Christian Church.

Fasting and prayer: On November 3, the members of the executive committee held a meeting at Tian'an Church and prayed earnestly. At 12 noon, they all fasted for one meal to show their reverence.

Follow-up work: If anyone signs up for discipleship during this great evangelistic event, it is planned to hold a welcoming meeting for disciples on the 17th. On the 18th and 19th, the speakers will conduct follow-up work, and the executive committee will convene again on the 20th to announce the conclusion. This expanded evangelistic week is completely in accordance with the methods of large evangelistic events in Britain and the United States. It is a pioneering initiative in Shanghai, uniting all denominations.

### Rice Bags Collapse, Injuring Workers

At the Shuntai Warehouse on Gongping Road, Hongkou, at around 4 PM yesterday, a large shipment of rice suddenly arrived. A considerable number of coolies, numbering dozens, were hired to carry the rice into the warehouse for storage. However, due to the excessive height of the stacking, the rice suddenly collapsed, injuring eight coolies. People called for cars to transport the eight injured workers to the hospital for treatment.

### Rice Shop Owner Arrested for Hoarding Rice with Thai Rice Shop

The Xingtai Rice Shop at 263 Rue Sainte Marie, French Concession, was opened by Ling Dechang, a native of Nantong, about half a year ago. Yesterday morning at around 8 AM, Ling, due to the recent strict investigations by the French authorities, colluded with accomplices to take advantage of the situation to smuggle 20 bags of top-grade Xian rice out of the back door of the shop in Houde Lane, intending to hoard them in a certain house in Houde Lane. Unexpectedly, the plan was not secret and was discovered by the patrol officer stationed at the shop, who immediately detained them and reported to the Lujiazui Police Station by telephone. The police station immediately sent detectives to investigate and seized the original 20 bags of Xian rice. The owner of the Xingtai Rice Shop and the resident of the house in Houde Lane where the rice was hidden were both arrested and taken to the police station for detention and investigation. It is heard that the French police station has recently stationed two patrol officers at each rice shop to investigate whether there is any hoarding or malpractice. Therefore, several illegal rice shops have been investigated in recent days and are now being interrogated separately.

### Rapid Progress in Education at All Levels in Guangxi Province

Director of Education of Su Province Makes a Statement (Guilin Correspondence) A reporter recently met with Su Xiyun, Director of the Department of Education of Guangxi Province, and asked about the situation of education at all levels in Guangxi Province this year. He was informed as follows: 1. Elementary Education: Elementary education in Guangxi Province is extremely developed. On average, every county and village has a basic school. The number of schools is the highest in the country. According to statistics, the number of school-age children enrolled in schools in the province accounts for more than 80% of the total. However, due to insufficient funding for each school, low teacher salaries, and simple school equipment, student achievement is affected. Therefore, it is planned to improve these aspects in the future. 2. Secondary Education: Secondary education has also been extremely developed in recent years. Last year (1940), the number of secondary school students in the province was 37,000. This year, it has increased to more than 51,000. The increase in the number of students means that the original schools are not enough to accommodate them, so there was a so-called "school shortage," that is, students found it difficult to find a school to attend. This autumn, private schools have also increased the number of classes as much as possible. This difficulty has been resolved. The Department of Education also pays close attention to various private schools, fearing that poor management will delay students' studies. 3. Normal Education: At present, elementary schools in this province feel a lack of teachers. This is not because there are not enough teachers, but because the salaries of elementary school teachers are meager, and graduates of normal schools are changing careers. There are currently seven normal schools and one special teacher training institute in this province. It is planned to add another normal school in the next year (1942) to train teachers. At the same time, attention will be paid to the work of "retaining teachers," that is, trying to improve teachers' salaries so that they can work with peace of mind. This will prevent teachers from being restless and causing a shortage of teachers. 4. Adult Education: This province designated 1939 as Adult Education Year, stipulating that adults aged 18 to 40 must receive civic education. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. Adults in the province who have received civic education account for more than 91% of the total. However, due to manpower and financial resources, the education time seems to be too short. It is planned to retrain adults who have already received civic training for two months to enable them to have a considerable understanding of the country and the nation and to generate great power for the war of resistance and national reconstruction.

Marriage

### The Implementation of the Micro-Marriage System

— Fei Liao

Ms. Fulei, who has been working at a marriage agency for many years, said to a group of students studying marriage problems: "Many people suggest that there should no longer be the pretense of an introducer in the wedding program from now on; they even think that having the introducer's signature on the marriage certificate is an insult to their sacredness..." This group of extremists shouted, "Don't allow the fly feet of the introducer to stain the pure marriage!"

Indeed, it is true. Nowadays, in the process of young Americans getting together, it is rare to go through a specially designated introducer. They will boldly publicly seek marriage partners in newspapers and magazines and get their objects. This trend is advancing day by day. According to the statistics of a pastor who often performs weddings, it almost accounts for more than 22 percent. There is no other reason for this, it is the change in the marriage psychology of young people, because everyone feels that automatically exploring a spouse is more meaningful.

Except for a few failures, their success has indeed painted a bright color in the history of marriage! Most of them can get a happy spouse and establish a happy family. Today, it seems that everyone believes that the best introducer is still themselves.

Public micro-marriage, as long as you can grasp the center, is a very good system. It will give you an unexpected harvest, just like Columbus got the New World! You may not have a spouse, among classmates, among friends, among neighbors, among relatives; but I believe that there is no spouse in this world that belongs to you. Perhaps a handsome young man fishing by the sea thousands of miles away will be your ideal husband!

The greatest benefit of micro-marriage is that it is broad and universal, so you can reduce the regret of "omission."

However, everyone should pay attention to: it needs a more calm head and a more cautious attitude to deal with. Otherwise, you will see that there are too many heroes and beauties in the world, making it impossible for you to choose.

The biggest condition for preparing to seek marriage is honesty. Don't exaggerate yourself as the number one person in the world. At best, you can learn from the marriage advertisement written by Mr. Jin Tang:

"Jin Tang, an Indian mixed race, 28 years old, dropped out of middle school one semester short. Now working as a receptionist at the International Apartment. Fills in as a servant in the Gentleman's Cafeteria at lunchtime, and as an attendant at the No-Ending Electric City broadcaster on Saturday nights. Holds a National Bank Type A Special Convenience Savings Deposit Passbook with a balance of 394 yuan and 74 percent (interest not yet included). Has a positive personality, thick-skinned, weighs 140 pounds, and has a certificate signed by Dr. Fuke proving that he has no venereal disease. If there is a Miss who is tired of the taste of Miss and can get used to living in a small room, please come to 16 Sheep Dormitory in person on Sunday morning for a face-to-face meeting."

Please don't laugh at this frank advertisement. He has already found a beautiful and virtuous partner. Their home is still praised as the "Home of Happiness"!

I [missing word] Our newspapers are now beginning to see some "micro-marriage" type things. We strongly agree with this principle, but at the same time, we solemnly say, don't treat it as a joke! Many [missing word] budding seedlings only allow us to cultivate, not to destroy! If we can promote the micro-marriage system in a regulated manner, with the breadth of our country's territory and the size of the population, who says this is not a matter of increasing happiness? At least, the number of single men and unmarried women will be reduced a little!

Science

### Atomic Fission and Lawrence

— Qian Jiajun

One evening twelve years ago, the University of California [missing text] second vacuum tube, and countless electrical points were quickly fired from the tube to the other end. The simple device was the first model used to impact atoms.

An assistant said to the professor: "Mr. Lawrence, the power is too small, I'm afraid it won't be able to break the atom." Lawrence nodded. He then managed ten vacuum tubes, using copper as the poles and a large magnet in the middle. When the current passed through, the thunderbolt flew at high speed from one pole to the other, and the magnet sucked the electricity into a solid spiral speedometer, recording an extremely high rate of flight. "Success!" He cheered excitedly.

In 1939, Lawrence won the Nobel Prize in Physics because he was the first person in the world to split the atom. But he still doesn't think he is satisfied. He is now rushing to build a shooter that is twenty times larger than the original one, preparing to use the energy released by the atom due to fission as the driving force for industry.

Sixty years ago, scientists all thought that atoms were indivisible small particles. Now everyone understands that each atom is like the solar system, with a nucleus in the middle and electrons orbiting it endlessly. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons. All substances are composed of electrons, protons, and neutrons, but the arrangement is different. If one million atoms were arranged in a row, they would only fill the gap between the point and stroke of the English letter [missing word], and the degree of its smallness can be imagined. But the position of the nucleus in the atom is like a fly in the hall. Protons and neutrons are combined and wrapped in the nucleus with great force. If you want to split it, of course you need extremely large power, so Lawrence's [missing word] initial shooter used an electromotive force of one million volts.

Now ordinary shooting instruments also have a rate of 18,000 miles per second, which is 35,000 times faster than a rifle bullet. When sodium atoms are shot, they become magnetic because the 11 outer electrons are supplied by heavy hydrogen and increase to 12. Electron shooting can also transform aluminum into phosphorus, nitrogen into boron, and can also have temporary radioactivity, a property previously unique to radium and its related elements.

After being shot, atoms of several elements can release neutron light, which doctors have used to treat tumors in humans and other animals. It is said to be very effective. Thanks to Lawrence's invention, zoologists are studying the growth and metabolism of animals, and botanists can understand how green plants make starch from carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. In industry, radioactive hydrogen can refine petroleum, and radioactive chlorine can also detect whether the steel plates inside warships are dense or not. According to recent research, uranium can release 50 million times more heat than carbon when split.

There are 37 atomic shooting instruments in the world. The largest shooting machine in the United States designed by Lawrence has a magnet weighing 4,900 tons. The total cost is 1.4 million US dollars. It took three years to complete and requires an electromotive force of 100 million volts. When the experiment is in progress, even the control room deep underground at 150 feet will feel a violent tremor.

Invention

### Fireproof Cotton

— Yongyun

Fireproof cotton is a cheap, lightweight, and durable insulator, suitable for everyday household use, and when used as a decoration on Christmas trees, it poses no danger. Its manufacturing process involves "wrapping" the cotton fibers with crystals of a substance that makes the fibers non-flammable. The exact details are unknown to outsiders. Someone placed a hinge nail heated to 1500 degrees into two pounds of fireproof cotton. As a result, after the hinge nail cooled, the cotton showed no change, except for a weight loss of five percent. However, a direct torch can pierce this coarse cotton, but there is no flame, so the fire will not spread, as shown in the figure.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Fourteen: Living the Life of a Hero

Begonia was already modest by nature. Now that he has reached a point where he has no choice but to make a living as a "tumbling insect" in Shanghai, he is naturally even more careful when he meets people. Although the martial arts supervisor didn't know his background, he couldn't help but say a few words in his favor when introducing him on account of the young boss. At the same time, Begonia himself clasped his hands and bowed, saying many insider words. Therefore, after going around in a circle, the impression was very good, and everyone got along with him very well, with no intention of looking down on him.

However, in reality, how can the relationship between people be so simple?

"Please put your clothes over there. We martial arts practitioners must abide by some martial arts rules!" He took off his tattered outer jacket and was about to hang it on a row of clothes hooks nailed to the partition wall when a very loud voice suddenly rang out behind him.

He hurriedly retracted his hand and turned his head in alarm.

Unexpectedly, standing in front of him was the martial arts leader whom the martial arts supervisor had just introduced to him, repeatedly requesting him to take care of him. This gentleman's height was probably at least a head taller than Begonia. His round face, sweeping eyebrows, and a pair of goldfish eyes protruding about three or four fen beyond his eyelids already made him intimidating enough! What's more, at this time, his face showed a kind of indescribable strangeness, which naturally made Begonia panic even more! (259)

### Hollywood's Warm Support for China Relief

— Yi

Since New York Mayor La Guardia actively promoted aid to China, the "One Bowl of Rice" movement has spread to various parts of the United States. Not only is there spiritual support, but the enthusiasm for donations is also very fervent. The stars of the eight major Hollywood companies dare not show weakness. Although their donations are not a large sum, their enthusiasm cannot be buried. The first was the romantic young man Mickey Rooney. He remembered, on a rainy morning, putting thirty US dollars in a silver-plated box and personally delivering it to New York City Hall in the rain (he came from Hollywood to attend a friend's wedding that day). After the mayor came out to greet this sudden visitor, Mickey Rooney took out the small box and said it was to help Chinese refugees. In addition to thanking him as usual, the mayor also shared breakfast with him in the dining room.

Shirley Temple, of great fame, after finishing filming "The Blue Bird" last year, wrote a "My Autobiography" herself, which was published by the New York Life Bookstore. It sells more than 10,000 copies every month. Because she knows that she has a large audience in China who welcome her, she took 31 percent of the September royalties from this "My Autobiography" and donated it to the American Red Cross as a fund for aid to China.

There is a Chinese photographer named Hu Di at Warner Bros. He also completely dedicated the remuneration from his recently completed film to the American Red Cross to purchase wheat and donate it to Chinese refugees.

Qin Qiu Zha Jisi also initiated a proposal for an impromptu donation to Chinese and English refugees at a company party. With one person starting, everyone responded, and more than two hundred yuan were raised.

The Chinese Embassy in the United States will hold a banquet to thank the Hollywood stars for their aid to China in order to reward their sincerity.

### [Dr. Ding]'s Yan Fei Kidnapped – Interesting Anecdotes During the Performance of [Metamorphosis]

— Bai Jin

Cao Yu's "Metamorphosis," performed by the Shanghai Professional Theatre Troupe at the Carlton Theatre, has been going on for a month, and the audience has been no less than 35,000 people. Because "Metamorphosis" is full of the positiveness of the present era, which is in line with the audience's spiritual food, the box office success has never waned. For example, on a recent Sunday, even the early show sold more than 5,500 yuan, setting a record for the box office of spoken drama. Therefore, the "Professional" authorities are preparing to continue performing for another month in order to further expand the audience's scope.

During the performance of "Metamorphosis," an interesting anecdote occurred a few days ago: After the performance that day, three young ladies of the intellectual class rushed to the backstage. Very emotionally, they hugged Yan Fei, who played [Dr. Ding], and then dragged her out. It turned out that their purpose was to invite [Dr. Ding] to a late-night meal. Yan Fei, unable to refuse the hospitality, went with them to Gongdelin, across from the back door of the Carlton Theatre. For a time, the actors in the [Professional] laughed:

Chapter 19: Dusk – Tartar Cavalry, Dust Fills the City

But after I came back, I heard Fang Xiting say: [This is just an expedient measure for the time being, temporarily borrowing the strength of others. After defeating the bandits, General Wu will still be loyal to the Ming Dynasty and will never cooperate with the Qing court.] Zhang Cangqiu said: [I'm not sure he will be able to do so.] Xu Jing said: [In any case, this is always a misjudgment on the General's part. Although future events are unpredictable, this approach is tantamount to planting the seeds of disaster in advance. Think about it, can there be such a kind and righteous person in the world who does not seize our land but is willing to help us quell internal strife? Alas! General Wu only cares about the present and does not think about the future. Is this the behavior of a hero? That's why Zhang Big Brother and I have to leave.] Chai Ying said: [I sympathize with what you all said. However, since General Wu has already done it, we cannot undo it for the time being, but only seek ways to remedy it. Therefore, I do not want you to leave General Wu like this. I have come here specifically to persuade you to return with me and not to leave him for the time being. When General Wu borrows Qing troops, recaptures Yanjing, and drives out the bandit, we will help General Wu to devote all our efforts to resist the Qing people and prevent them from occupying an inch of our land within the pass. If, at that time, General Wu still has hesitant intentions, let alone you want to leave, even I, Chai, would not want to be indirectly driven by foreign races under his command. Then we might as well think of other ways to benefit the country. I hope you will understand what I have said. It is not for General Wu's personal gain, but really for the sake of the country that I am persuading you not to leave completely. Let's all stay together, quell the bandits together, and wait and see what happens. General Wu has read poetry and books, so he will probably not become a tool of the Tartars and forget his motherland.] (125)
