### Konoe Fumimaro Resumes as "Matchmaker" - Formation of New Japanese Cabinet - Teijiro Toyoda Succeeds Matsuoka as Foreign Minister - Army Minister Tojo and Navy Minister Oikawa Remain in Office

Tokyo, 18th (Reuters) - The new Japanese cabinet was fully formed this afternoon, just 24 hours after Konoe was ordered to form a cabinet. Navy Admiral Teijiro Toyoda, who served as Minister of Commerce and Industry in the second Konoe cabinet, has been appointed Foreign Minister to succeed Matsuoka. Other noteworthy appointments include former Justice Minister Yanagawa being appointed Minister without Portfolio, and former Minister without Portfolio Ogura being appointed Finance Minister. Army Minister Tojo and Navy Minister Oikawa will both remain in their positions. The full list of the new cabinet is as follows:

Prime Minister and Justice Minister: Konoe Fumimaro; Foreign Minister and Colonial Minister: Navy Admiral Toyoda Teijiro; Interior Minister: Tanabe Harumichi; Finance Minister: Ogura Masatsune; Army Minister: Lieutenant General Tojo Hideki (reappointed); Navy Minister: Navy Admiral Oikawa Koshiro (reappointed); Education Minister: Hashida Kunihiko; Agriculture and Forestry Minister: Ino Takuyo; Minister of Commerce and Industry: Navy Lieutenant General Sakonji Seizo (former president of the North Sakhalin Oil Production Company); Minister of Railways and Communications: Murata Shozo; Welfare Minister: Lieutenant General Koizumi Chikahiko; Minister without Portfolio: Lieutenant General Yanagawa Heisuke (former Justice Minister), Lieutenant General Suzuki Teiichi.

Former Interior Minister Hiranuma Kiichiro has also been decided to be appointed as Minister without Portfolio. Cabinet Planning Board President Lieutenant General Suzuki will continue to concurrently serve as Cabinet Secretary-General Tomita Kenji, Legislation Bureau Director-General Murase Naoyasu, and Information Bureau Director Ito Suetsugu will also remain in their original positions.

Tokyo, 18th (United Press) - After 48 hours, the Emperor personally presided over the inauguration ceremony for the new cabinet members selected by Prime Minister Konoe at 8:50 PM this afternoon in the Phoenix Hall of the Imperial Palace. The Emperor approved the list of new cabinet members submitted by Konoe at 7:00 PM this afternoon and rejected the resignations of the former cabinet members who were not selected for the third Konoe cabinet. The new cabinet formed by Konoe is more streamlined, with a total of only fourteen members, compared to sixteen in the previous cabinet. Fourteen former cabinet members remain, eleven of whom hold cabinet positions. A notable feature of the new cabinet is the presence of three Ministers without Portfolio, compared to only one in the previous cabinet. The new Foreign Minister Toyoda is a key member of the Mitsubishi company and the son-in-law of Navy Lieutenant General Takeda. He previously served as a naval attach√© at the Japanese Embassy in the UK. He is from Wakayama Prefecture, the same hometown as Ambassador to the US Nomura.

Tokyo, 18th (Reuters) - Konoe began the process of forming the new cabinet at his official residence this morning. Informed sources believe that a draft list could be completed by today afternoon, after which the new cabinet members will be formally appointed by the Emperor in the palace. At 1:10 AM this morning, Konoe invited outgoing Commerce Minister Toyoda to his official residence for a meeting, which concluded at 11:45 AM. Konoe also invited Sakonji, the president of the North Sakhalin Oil Company, to a meeting at 10:10 AM, who then left the Prime Minister's residence. At 11:35 AM, he visited outgoing Navy Minister Oikawa, who then returned to the Prime Minister's residence to report on the discussions to Konoe. Konoe also invited former Finance Minister Tada of the Hiranuma cabinet to a meeting at 12:10 PM this afternoon. Meanwhile, Kaya, the president of the North China Development Company and financial advisor to the Ministry of Finance, visited outgoing Minister without Portfolio Ogura at his private residence for discussions. When Information Bureau spokesman Ishii was asked by reporters this morning whether there would be any changes to Japan's basic policies following the cabinet change, the spokesman replied that he could not add anything beyond the statement released by the Information Bureau regarding Konoe's resignation. Meanwhile, newspapers are speculating about the selection of the new Foreign Minister, as this is seen as the key to forming the new cabinet. Newspapers are emphasizing the need to address the world situation with agility and decisiveness. According to Miyako Shimbun, outgoing Army Minister Tojo sought the opinion of Foreign Ministry diplomatic advisor Saito after consulting with outgoing Navy Minister Oikawa, with the selection of the Foreign Minister being a key topic of discussion. It is also reported that Minister of State Kido discussed the issue with Vice Minister Ohashi. The Prime Minister is currently seeking opinions from all sides and is making every effort to find a satisfactory solution to the issue. According to the Nichi Nichi Shimbun, diplomatic advisor Saito was very busy last night, first visiting Prime Minister Konoe at 7:20 PM, followed by a visit to former Foreign Minister Matsuoka. Matsuoka, despite being ill at home, still discussed state affairs with Saito and said that he would visit Konoe today.

Tokyo, 18th (Reuters) - Financial circles generally believe that Konoe's appointment to form a cabinet indicates that there will be no immediate changes to domestic and foreign policies. Leaders in the financial and business sectors believe that the third Konoe cabinet will seek to intensify state control over oil, coal, and chemicals in order to increase the production of war industries, implement new currency management procedures, and tighten control over food supplies.

### New Japanese Cabinet is "Old Wine in New Bottles" - Basic Policies Unlikely to Change

Washington, 18th (United Press) - Konoe's reappointment as Prime Minister today indicates that Japanese policies will not be manipulated by extremists in the near future. With Konoe as the head of the government, Japan's policies are likely to be more moderate. Konoe is the only figure in Japanese politics who has criticized the military and still maintained his political life. Konoe has openly stated that he cannot allow the military to rule the entire country. Konoe is not a weak or incompetent person who simply follows the tide. He has great courage and may be the most prominent patriot in Japan today. He has a definite plan and is determined not to waver. Many of the policies implemented by former Foreign Minister Matsuoka were opposed by Konoe. He could have overthrown Matsuoka six months ago, but he feared causing internal turmoil. Now he can clear out the internal elements and promote a new start for Japan. (Note: This dispatch was sent by United Press Tokyo bureau chief Thomson, who resided in Japan for five years and recently returned to Washington.)

New York, 18th (United Press) - The Scripps-Howard newspapers commented yesterday that the recent cabinet reshuffle in Japan would not change Japan's basic policies. Even if the new cabinet is formed by liberals and anti-Axis leaders, their policies and lives will still be in the hands of military dictators. Japanese politicians are merely the front line for the military, and the real power holders are the terrorists. The commentary argued that regardless of Britain's needs in the Atlantic, the United States should maintain a balance of its naval and air power in the Pacific. This measure is more effective than anything else in preventing war in the Far East. The New York Times stated that the two resignations of the Konoe cabinet indicate that the Japanese government is divided from top to bottom and reveal that the political views among Japanese leaders are irreconcilable. The policies decided by the Imperial Conference are based on a complete compromise between the government and the military authorities and will not change. To implement this policy in future emergency situations, the first priority is to form a government that is trusted and obeyed by the entire nation. The reason for the cabinet reshuffle is precisely this. The semi-official organ The Japan Times stated that the future cabinet "will expand the political power of the government with all its strength and complete large-scale economic plans." Asahi Shimbun stated that the selection of the new Foreign Minister will be the main task of Konoe's cabinet reshuffle. Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Japan's basic policies have been set and that it should abandon its passive attitude so that this policy has a proactive and flexible approach to cope with the changing international situation.

### Britain Wishes to Maintain Peace in the Far East

San Francisco, 28th (Reuters) - British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, stated yesterday at the Federal Club here that Hitler may offer peace proposals, but he can assert that they will be rejected regardless of the conditions. Halifax also discussed the situation in the Far East, saying that Britain has decided on a policy, and he believes the US government has as well, which is to do its best to maintain peace in the Pacific. Britain has no intention of fighting with Japan. If Japan is willing to negotiate on various influential issues in the Far East and give due respect to the rights of other related countries, then he truly does not understand why any difficulties should arise that would lead to conflict.

### Japan's Attitude is Hesitant and Vacillating, Repeatedly Making Strong Hints

Basel, Switzerland, 17th (Havas) - After the resignation of the Japanese Konoe cabinet, the eyes of European countries are focused on Tokyo, and they are speculating on the meaning of this cabinet reshuffle. The Basler Nachrichten stated that in Berlin, the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan was

### Main Reason for Cabinet Reshuffle is to Strengthen Political Institutions

Tokyo, 17th (Havas)

Political figures here generally believe that the third Konoe cabinet will be a true wartime cabinet, that is, to strengthen the organization to cope with any eventuality. The main purposes of this cabinet reshuffle are two: First, to give the government greater freedom in diplomacy to implement the national policy decided by the Imperial Conference on July 2nd; Second, to grant the government broad powers to control national life, especially economic and financial institutions.

Tokyo, 18th (Havas World News Agency) - Newspapers here are commenting on the cabinet reshuffle, focusing on internal affairs, and say on July 2nd. The Z√ºricher Tagesanzeiger stated that since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Japan has never indicated that it would act in concert with Germany. The German government has already understood this. In fact, Japan has remained silent for a month, which is clear evidence of the seriousness of the problems Japan is currently encountering. Regarding Italy, according to a dispatch from the Swiss Telegraphic Agency, the Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia believes that Japan must explain its attitude at this time because the possibility of the United States entering the war is increasing daily. "At a time when the great powers are about to enter the war, it is difficult for Japan to stay out of it." However, it is still difficult to believe that Japan's basic policies will change course. The Journal de Gen√®ve reported that its Rome correspondent said that because the United States may enter the war, Japan must decide on a path. This path is extremely dangerous for Japan, but it also has great benefits.

Rome, 18th (Haitong Agency) - The Italian government is maintaining silence regarding the resignation of the Japanese Konoe cabinet. Italy does not like to advise on the internal affairs of other countries, especially its close friend Japan. Responsible figures deeply feel that the situation in the Far East has become increasingly serious. Italy is watching the measures Japan intends to take with sympathy. The Italian people firmly believe that Japanese policy will be based on fundamental national interests.

Editorial

### Implementation of Food Administration

Since the establishment of the Ministry of Food, food has also been included in the ranks of administration. In broad terms, policies related to land, agriculture, and water conservancy are all included. However, land is not just about allocation; it also requires utilizing the benefits of the land. Agriculture is not just about cultivating, improving, and pest control; it also requires seizing the right time of the year. Water conservancy is not just about ditches and embankments; it should also take into account forestry policies. Therefore, to solve the problem of food, it is necessary to plan comprehensively and not focus on one aspect. Cooperation in division of labor is necessary to achieve effective results.

In terms of its function, it is nothing more than solving the problem of food for the people. However, to solve the problem of food for the people, seeking sufficiency lies in abundant production. Seeking to make up for deficiencies with surpluses lies in ample storage. Seeking appropriate adjustments lies in smooth transportation. Seeking equitable distribution lies in sales controls. With these four factors in place, the effectiveness of food administration will be evident, yet it may still not be the best solution. Governance lies in the welfare of the entire people, not just focusing on the interests of one class or one type, and considering it capable of promoting benefits and eliminating harm. Too high prices hurt the people, while too low prices hurt the farmers. Li Kui mentioned this more than 2,300 years ago. Therefore, only by leveling production and sales, taking into account both the people and the farmers, can the people not suffer from high prices, and the farmers not suffer from low prices. Everyone will be happily engaged in their work and enjoy its benefits. This is the success of solving the food problem.

China is known as a country based on agriculture, but famines have occurred repeatedly, and disaster relief has never ceased. The system of granaries, although developed early and well-made, is still unable to relieve the urgency of the people's food needs, which has caused doubt among commentators. In fact, in the past two thousand years or so, China has been nominally emphasizing agriculture, but the status of farmers has been low. It has been nominally devaluing merchants, but the status of merchants has been high. This has been the case since the Warring States, Qin, and Han dynasties. At times, there has been consideration for farmers to have their own land, and efforts have been devoted to the system of equal land distribution, up until the Tang dynasty, and there were people making the attempt. However, it was still impossible to solve the problems of land ownership and production for farmers. Firstly, farmers' lives are best suited for stability, but wars occurred frequently, and famines occurred repeatedly. Farmers' production was already weak, and once they were disrupted and displaced, they lost everything. As a result, the trend of seizing land became widespread. Secondly, Chinese farmers are the only producers in China, and they are the ultimate bearers of all burdens. Taxes come from farmers, the profits of merchants accrue to farmers, and high-interest exploitation is on farmers. However, in terms of farmers' production capacity, it is extremely fragile. They entrust everything to fate, attribute floods, droughts, and insect pests to destiny, and blame exploitation and manipulation on people. The benefits that accrue to others are many, while the benefits that they enjoy are few. Therefore, when famine comes, the farmers, who are known for their production, suffer the most. Thirdly, farmers adhere to old farming methods. Although they have good experience, they also lack the ability to adapt and improve. Furthermore, they do not receive education and have few opportunities to absorb new ideas and discard old ones. As a result, their status has become increasingly degraded, and they have become the oppressed in society. Therefore, although dynasties have nominally suppressed commerce and valued agriculture in terms of laws and policies, farmers have ultimately been unable to improve their status. They are limited by knowledge, bound by wealth, and shackled by social forces.

Collecting physical goods has long been the practice under the old agricultural production system in China, the so-called "natural color." Since commercial capital gradually developed, Emperor Dezong of the Tang dynasty changed the collection of taxes to summer and autumn taxes, with the tax rate determined by money and grain. As a result, the use of money and later silver for paying taxes became the dominant method, and the collection of physical goods gradually declined. At the end of the Qing dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China, there was a fierce debate over whether to accumulate grain or money. However, the reason why people strongly advocated accumulating money rather than grain at the time was precisely because they recognized that it was difficult to manage grain and easy to use money. Now it seems that we are moving towards the opposite direction, accumulating grain rather than money. This is likely because prices are high, the value of currency is low, and collecting physical goods is more practical than collecting money. From this, it can be seen that accumulating money or grain is not like the monkeys of Old Man Ju who were unable to understand giving chestnuts but is due to changes in the times. However, the collection of physical goods is extremely difficult, and losses are heavy. How can these losses be compensated? If compensation is sought from taxpayers, the old problem of "fire consumption" (originally referring to silver, but grain also has losses, so both are mentioned together) will arise. Will this not be an extra levy? If losses are borne by the government, then the amount of loss is a matter of responsibility for the officials in charge. If they are not enough to cover the costs through embezzlement and graft, then the practice of "kicking the bucket and dripping the tip" will come into play, and abuses will arise from this. Moreover, there are various procedures in the collection process, various loopholes for taxpayers, and the customs and sentiments of people in different regions, all of which must be taken into consideration. What should be particularly noted is that when grain is gathered, the price of grain often becomes expensive due to absorption. When grain is returned, it becomes cheap due to external release. If old grain is returned, it is not clear what the value of the grain will be. If new grain is returned, then the process of taking and giving is still for merchants. Looking at the history of the Ever-Normal Granary, with its pros and cons of releasing old grain and replacing it with new grain, it can serve as a lesson. Food administration is a large-scale undertaking that was previously divided among various departments, making it difficult to coordinate everything and establish a good model. Now that there is a specialized department responsible for construction, it will be able to thoroughly establish a foundation for China's grain production, people's food, military supplies, and storage, and lay the foundation for people's livelihoods. This will not only fulfill the promotion of the food problem by people in society for the past fifteen years, but also provide hope for the realization of the Three Principles of the People and the solution of the problem of eating!

### British Newspaper Examines Japanese Policy: Dominating East Asia is Just a Dream

London, 18th (Reuters) - The Times published a long article yesterday examining Japanese policy, entitled "Japan's Dreams and Reality." It first described Japanese foreign policy since the 16th century, tracing the course of its isolationist policies. It argued that the current events in China are clear evidence that Japan's ambition to dominate East Asia is just a dream. When the European War broke out, the Konoe cabinet saw it as an excellent opportunity and decided to lean towards the country it believed would win in order to gain its consent in advance, so that Japan could share in its spoils and remove all obstacles in Japan's path. Matsuoka's new book on Japan's world mission states that the gist of Japan's goals will be understood in about thirty years and will begin to produce results in fifty years. According to non-official but authoritative sources, Japan's goals include all areas within the 180th meridian and the Arabian Sea, including India, Malaya, Australia, and half of the world's population. The form of its future rule can be seen in the structure of Manchukuo, which is nominally independent but actually a Japanese colony, and in the demands of the victorious countries published by the Japan Times, an organ of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs: (1) Britain and the United States will change all key points from Gibraltar to Hawaii into small garrison areas; (2) European territories in the Pacific will be granted independent autonomy, with Japanese as their government advisors, so that various forms of cooperation within the Co-Prosperity Sphere can achieve rationalized peace conditions. Although Japanese politicians say that Japan has no territorial ambitions and hates Western imperialism, they also openly state that those who are not sincere or do not understand Japan's true intentions, such as China, will be whipped. The Konoe cabinet fully agreed with the Nazi plan to divide the world into four or five groups: (1) the German-Italian group, which includes all of Europe and Africa; (2) the Soviet group, which includes parts of East Asia and Central Asia; (3) the American group, which includes North and South America; (4) the British Empire group, but only if Britain agrees to a negotiated peace; (5) the Greater East Asia group, led by Japan. To achieve its goals, Japan is pouring its new efforts into the war against Chiang Kai-shek and is planning to strengthen the Nanjing regime to promote the peace movement. It is also sending troops to Vietnam to force a mediation of the land dispute between Thailand and Vietnam and is concluding a commercial treaty that will allow Japan to exploit Vietnam's resources. However, this policy of Japan has encountered two setbacks: one is the continued resistance of Chiang Kai-shek, and the other is the attitude of the Dutch East Indies. Japan is no stranger to suspicion and its machinations, which are due to the aid of the United States. Japanese newspapers are also vigorously denouncing the Dutch East Indies government, referring to it as a puppet of Britain and the United States. Therefore, Japan has reached the point where it must first resolve its issues with Britain and the United States before it can proceed with its plans or escape its predicament in China. However, although Japan has made various proposals in this regard, it has not been able to achieve its wishes. The Konoe cabinet has not given up its policies and can only maintain its belief that Britain and the United States will eventually fail. Japanese newspapers are loudly proclaiming that the failure of Britain and the United States is inevitable, but most Japanese people do not believe this and are gradually feeling that Japan is on the wrong path. More conservative Japanese politicians who are unwilling to take adventurous actions, and merchants who know that Japan's prosperity depends heavily on foreign trade (before the war, Japan's trade with democracies accounted for 70% of the total), do not see the need for Japan to offend Britain and the United States. It is noteworthy that the idea of Japan assisting Germany and Italy in the war has been denounced as the work of Germany's fifth column. However, the goal of Japan's national policy is supported by the entire country, which is undeniable. Therefore, the only question now is whether the path taken by the government is appropriate. Japanese people want to see their country replace the rights of white people such as Britain and the United States in East Asia, but they do not want to pay the price of harming the country. Japanese people are realistic. Although the military rebellion of February 26, 1936, was suppressed, its latent ideology is still the basis of the new institutions. However, Japan's totalitarian system is hindered by three factors: one is the Diet, which, although said to be weak, still showed its expected strength in the last session; two is the conservative faction, led by Interior Minister Hiranuma; three is the higher-ranking army leaders, who have discovered through bitter experience that the control of industry by soldiers and bureaucrats not only does not increase its efficiency but also greatly reduces production. Therefore, the cabinet is organized jointly by soldiers and people from the business community who are engaged in the economic war led by Ogura. This is the general situation of the current Japanese cabinet.

### Soviet Union Reaffirms Maintaining Friendship with Japan - Denies Ceding Pacific Base - Fisheries and Trade Negotiations are in Progress

Moscow, 18th (United Press) - Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Lozovsky told reporters yesterday that the Soviet Union has repeatedly stated its friendly relations with Japan since the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, and that Stalin and Konoe have fully understood this statement. Lozovsky also denied reports that the Soviet Union was negotiating with the United States to cede border areas in the Pacific as a base, saying that this report was a wartime newspaper rumor.

Tokyo, 18th (Reuters) - Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin visited Vice Minister Ohashi at 10:00 AM today for an hour. When Information Bureau spokesman Ishii was asked by reporters this morning about the Soviet Union establishing a dangerous area in the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk, the spokesman replied that he did not know whether the Japanese government had protested to the Soviet government. Regarding the Japanese-Soviet fisheries and other negotiations, the spokesman said that these negotiations are still in progress. When asked about reports that Britain, the United States, and the Chongqing government were jointly purchasing raw materials in Vietnam and Thailand, and what Japan's reaction would be, the spokesman replied that this would depend on the amount purchased, but that there was no official information to verify this report.

### Japan Exerts Pressure on Vietnam - Hoping to Obtain Base

London, 18th (United Press) - Neutral sources in contact with the Vichy government today expressed interest in confirming reports that Japan is continuing to exert significant pressure on P√©tain to hand over Cam Ranh Bay to Japan, otherwise Japan will seize this military seaport by force. Other diplomatic sources have also received similar reports to those published by the London Times' foreign affairs correspondent yesterday, that Japan threatened to attack Vietnam in order to obtain this base. One diplomatic source said that Tokyo only gave P√©tain a certain amount of time to decide whether to yield or fight. This source pointed out that Japan has a large number of air forces in Vietnam as a backing for its negotiations. Previously, about 130 Japanese aircraft were based in Hanoi and Haiphong, and this number has recently increased. It is reported that there are 300 aircraft stationed on Hainan Island, 180 on the Spratly Islands, and 300 in Taiwan. It is generally expected that after making new demands, Japan may adopt a more radical policy than it has recently taken towards Vietnam. Although Japanese leaders have been influenced by industrial leaders and conservative leaders, there are still those who believe that Japan can obtain favorable concessions from Vietnam without causing effective intervention or opposition from Britain and the United States. According to interpretations here, Japan's opinion is that this procedure will ensure that Japan obtains new sources of food and raw materials, which are useful bases. At the same time, it can also convince Hitler that Japan is cooperating diligently with the Axis powers.

Vichy, 18th (Havas) - Regarding French-Japanese relations, there have been many rumors lately. Informed sources here recently stated that in terms of diplomacy, there are currently no signs that French-Japanese relations have changed. Japanese Ambassador Kato's visit to Assistant Darlan yesterday was not a negotiation and did not introduce any new factors into this relationship.

### Japanese Troops in Various Parts of China Have Recently Begun to Withdraw; Only a Small Number of Troops Remain to Guard Strongholds; Japanese Troops in China Will Not Launch a Large-Scale Offensive

Chongqing The attention of the Chinese side is still focused on the changing tides in Japan, but so far, all predictions about future developments are based entirely on speculation, because the current strict censorship of news in Japan makes it difficult to obtain concrete information. At the same time, according to reports received by reliable Chinese sources here, it is suggested that Japanese troops in various parts of China have recently been withdrawing. However, Chinese sources have emphasized that this withdrawal does not necessarily mean that the Japanese intend to abandon any important cities they occupy in China. On the contrary, judging from the strong defensive works built by the Japanese army in various important cities, it can be seen that they intend to hold them. The only conclusion that can be drawn at present is that Japan, at least for the time being, does not plan to launch any large-scale offensive in China. After building strong defensive works, Japan will be able to withdraw most of its troops and only station troops sufficient to guard these strongholds. The general opinion is that the possibility of a Japanese attack on Chongqing has been eliminated, or at least it will be difficult to achieve before next summer, because the preparation for such a large-scale military operation will take some time. There is also news that Japan's mobilization is currently underway, and four divisions have completed mobilization. As for whether the troops withdrawn from China and those mobilized in Japan are intended for a northern offensive or a southern advance, it is still impossible to determine.

### Twenty-Seven Japanese Aircraft Raided Chongqing Yesterday; The Most Damaged Was the Press Association; A Bomb Also Landed on the Residence of the British Embassy

Chongqing Chongqing was bombed for the twentieth time this year. The bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft were heavier than usual. One of them landed on top of the air raid shelter of the British Embassy's hilltop residence. The ambassador and his staff were shaken, but no one was injured. A total of 27 Japanese aircraft flew over Chongqing at 1:00 p.m., forming a long and uneven line, bombing the western district. The most damaged was the Press Association. It is believed that there were few casualties in the densely populated residential area between the city headquarters. No foreign property was damaged, but the former French Embassy, which had been hit many times this year, was damaged again this time. One of the first bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft landed on the roof of the basement where British Ambassador Kerr and his staff were living. Although they suffered an unusual shock, no one was injured. The British Ambassador's residence was also slightly shaken and not damaged. The foreign-style Jialing Apartment was also shaken when several bombs landed near it, and although a huge bomb landed 75 yards from the Newspaper Apartment, creating a pit, the apartment was not damaged at all. (United Press dispatch of the 18th)

Chongqing Just after noon today, two batches of Japanese aircraft, 27 in total, fiercely bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing. The alarm was raised here in the morning when the Japanese aircraft were spotted. As the Japanese aircraft flew to the western suburbs, one team dropped bombs along the highway to Chengdu, and the other bombed the mountains in the west. The Japanese aircraft dropped a number of large bombs, creating bomb craters 25 feet wide and 20 feet deep. A fire broke out in one place, but it was quickly extinguished. Bombs fell around the Jialing Hotel, where most foreigners in Chongqing reside, including an incendiary bomb that landed directly in front of the hotel's entrance. Although the hotel building was not directly hit, one bomb directly hit the air raid shelter, causing considerable damage. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)

### Military Affairs Commission Releases One Week of Battle Situation (July 11th to 17th)

Chongqing The spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission discussed the battle situation for the week from July 11th to 17th. Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Japanese, although worried and depressed, are still actively preparing and seizing opportunities. Therefore, this week, there were only minor disturbances in eastern Guangdong and northern Jiangxi. A brief account is given below:

Eastern Guangdong The Japanese army in Huanggang City (east of Chao'an), as we reported last week, one unit invaded Qiandong to the west and had reached north of Zhanglin. Unexpectedly, on the 8th, more than 1,000 reinforcements suddenly invaded the north of Dengtawei and advanced towards Fushanwei. After being intercepted by the Chinese army, fierce fighting continued until the morning of the 9th. The Japanese army, having suffered losses, retreated towards Huanggang City. Then, the Chinese army, together with the troops that had captured Shangxincun from Fenshuiguan, attacked Huanggang City. By the evening of the 11th, the Japanese army was unable to resist and abandoned the city, retreating towards the coast. The Chinese army then recaptured Huanggang City and continued to clear the area towards the coast. At present, there is no trace of the Japanese army in Huanggang City and the area to the east. In this battle, more than 500 Japanese soldiers were killed.

Northern Jiangxi The Japanese army invaded the mountainous area in several routes. (1) On the evening of the 6th, a part of the Japanese army from Hege to Henglieshan'ao, west of Ruichang, confronted the Chinese army. (2) On the same evening, the Japanese army, advancing from Wangjiapu, southwest of Ruichang, in the Beiyashan Lukeng Zhang area, was met by the Chinese army and retreated after suffering losses on the evening of the 7th. (3) The Japanese army, invading Tianqiaohe Xiajiaqiao and other places northeast of Wudu, joined forces on the morning of the 8th to invade Xinxiyuan, north of Wuning. After being met by the Chinese army, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties and retreated towards Xixi from Tianqiaohe. One unit from Xiajiaqiao is still fighting the Chinese army at Meixiushan. (4) More than 1,000 Japanese troops in the area north of Anyi invaded Shixia Yu, northeast of Jing'an, on the night of the 10th. After being met by the Chinese army, many Japanese were killed. On the morning of the next day, the Japanese reinforced and invaded Tangping Wang. By noon, the Chinese army had completely defeated the Japanese army and seized Tangping Wang Shixia Yu and other strongholds in succession. The Japanese army retreated along the original route and has now restored its original state.

In addition, the Japanese army in Daye, southern Hubei, invaded Damushan on the 8th and was encircled and annihilated by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Qingyang Yinjiahui invaded Dawangmiao Dalangshan on the 7th and was repelled. The Japanese army in Chaoxian invaded Zhaoguan on the 8th and also suffered heavy losses. The Japanese army in Zhangdian, Jinpu, invaded Dalangmiao on the 7th and more than 100 Japanese soldiers below the rank of major were killed by the Chinese army. The Japanese army has been sporadically active everywhere, and the Chinese army cannot but launch small-scale attacks. (1) On the evening of the 7th, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army in Wanshe Street She Dian Wei and other places south of Nanchang, destroying three layers of barbed wire and seizing many rifles and military supplies. (2) On the evening of the 8th, a certain Chinese unit attacked the Japanese army in Xiao'ao, southwest of Ruichang. The Chinese artillery fired to assist in the battle. By the next morning, many Japanese soldiers had been killed and wounded, and the roads and bridges from Xiao'ao to Tianjiazhuang had been completely destroyed. (3) On the 6th and 7th, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army in Emeiling, Yepingfan, southwest of Chongyang, and captured many spoils. At the same time, another Chinese unit completely destroyed the transportation between Dashaping, north of Dizhoufan, and Laokoushi. The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses.

### Xu Mo Appointed Envoy to Australia

The Republic of China and the Commonwealth of Australia have decided to exchange envoys. The Australian side has been announced by Foreign Minister Stewart, and China also announced on May 14 that, in view of the current situation in the Pacific, China and Australia urgently need to send envoys to each other. After two months of selecting candidates for the first envoy, the Australian side has decided to send Eggerston as the first ambassador to China, and China is also expected to appoint Xu Mo, who has served as the Foreign Minister for many years. This marks the opening of a new era in the diplomatic history of China and Australia. Especially given Australia's current important position in the Pacific, the exchange of envoys is a very noteworthy event.

A former middle school teacher and journalist

Xu Mo, courtesy name Shumo, is a native of Wuxian. He is a man of outstanding talent, profound knowledge, and an outstanding talent in the diplomatic world. He graduated from the Law Department of Peking University in his early years, stayed in the United States, and obtained a Master of Laws and Politics. He was the first in the most outstanding class of the diplomatic official examination in the eighth year of the Republic of China. He worked as a teacher at Jiangsu No. 8 Middle School, and also served as a journalist. He worked as a judge and chief judge of the criminal court in the Shanghai Provisional Court. Later, he served as a counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Director of the European and American Department, and Jiangsu Negotiator. He is currently the Deputy Minister of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He speaks fluent Wu dialect, is short in stature, and is a small and capable figure in the diplomatic world. He, Xu Shiying, and Jiang Tingfu are three giants. He has always been very silent, but has a very strong memory. He can recite almost all kinds of diplomatic treaties, which is one of his genius characteristics.

An important part of the Pacific situation

Speaking of Australia, it occupies an extremely important part in today's Pacific situation. It sends expeditionary forces, manufactures aircraft for Britain, and its help to Britain in terms of manpower and material resources is very great. Its prosperity in agriculture and animal husbandry and its wealth of reserves will surely make it an important economic country in the world in the future. It has a population of more than 7 million, and its arms production exceeds India and far exceeds Canada. Its annual gold production is worth 11.1 million pounds, and its silver production is worth 5 million pounds. The annual value of factory production is 41.4 million pounds. Wool production ranks first in the world.

Striving for democracy and eternal friendship between the two countries

Although the relationship between Australia and China has been friendly in the past, it has not been close. In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Australian Federal Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Lanshan led an inspection group to China to meet with the Chinese authorities. After returning to China, Lan appointed Boden as the Australian Commercial Commissioner to China, stationed in Shanghai. In the autumn, 60 Australian girl scouts came to China for sightseeing, and diplomatic relations gradually increased. Until this year, Guo Taiqi, the current Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, negotiated with Britain and Australia. China and Australia both felt the need to send envoys to each other as soon as possible, and they have recently selected candidates. In the near future, China and Australia will not only enhance the friendship between the two countries, but also make a brilliant contribution to the world.

### Major Battles Erupt Between Soviet and German Forces on Four Main Lines; Soviet Counterattack at Smolensk is Successful; German Forces in the North Advance Towards Leningrad

Reuters, London, 18th The German offensive on the Eastern Front appears to have developed into a four-pronged major attack, with fierce fighting continuing in all areas. The first route is towards Leningrad. Regarding the war in this area, the Moscow Gazette claims that a major battle is underway in the area south of Lake Peipus, about 150 miles from Leningrad. It also said that Moscow Radio announced that the enemy had encountered extremely fierce resistance in this area, because a large number of civilians had joined the guerrillas, destroying railways, destroying German tanks, and disrupting their rear. In the central area, the German forces are trying to break through to Smolensk. The fighting seems to be still fierce. News from the Kiev front said that the German offensive towards Ukraine had been contained a few days ago. There is still fighting in the Novgorod to Volynsk area. As for the major battle currently underway in Bessarabia, there is very little news. The German forces in that area seem to have made slight progress. According to the Soviet military bulletin issued last night, on the evening of July 17, fierce fighting continued in the areas of Pskov, Smolensk, Bobruisk, and Bessarabia. There was little change in the positions of the two armies on the front line. The Soviet Air Force continued to attack the enemy's mechanized units and bombed enemy aircraft at various airports. According to preliminary reports, the German side lost a total of 22 aircraft, and the Soviet side also lost 8 aircraft. At the same time, the German High Command bulletin stated that a major battle was underway on the Eastern Front and that our side had gained an advantage.

Havas, Vichy, 17th According to news received here, the armies of Germany and the Soviet Union are continuing to fight fiercely along a 2,000-mile front. The battle for Leningrad and Moscow has gradually entered a critical stage. The general situation on each battlefield is as follows: (1) The battle for Leningrad is inherently complementary to the battle for Moscow. The war on both sides is becoming increasingly fierce. However, judging from the current situation, Leningrad may fall. Finnish troops are intensifying their encirclement from the north of the city, but are not attacking for the time being, waiting until the German troops approach from the south before launching an attack, in order to coordinate with each other. The vanguard of the German army has occupied the town of Loga in Estonia, about 60 miles south of Leningrad. Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, is in great danger. The Red Army in that area has been surrounded, but the Red Army in the Pskov region is still fighting bravely. (2) Regarding the battle for Moscow, according to Soviet war reports, fierce fighting is taking place between the two sides in the Smolensk region, which is only 170 miles from Moscow, and its importance is evident. Although the counterattack launched by the Red Army in the southern section of the line has been very successful, the German troops are advancing section by section in the northern section. The Red Army must make a strategic retreat immediately to avoid being surrounded. Generally, the Red Army will use the Dnieper River as the final defense line, in order to use the natural barrier to contain the German advance. (3) The battle for Ukraine takes Kiev, the capital of the state, as the main target. The German advance is very slow. Fierce fighting has been going on for ten days in the Novgorod-Volynsk region, and the German troops have not achieved anything. However, the Red Army commander has decided to abandon Kiev, so the fall of the city is imminent. (4) The German troops in the Bessarabia region have not been very active. Soon, they will join forces with the Hungarian and Slovak troops to launch an attack. After the fall of Chisinau, the capital of Bessarabia province, the German troops have built many bridgeheads on the Prut River in order to spy on the Dniester River.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 18th According to the German military department, since the Stalin Line was broken, the war on the entire front is proceeding fiercely. Although the Soviet resistance is fierce, the German troops are making progress everywhere. It is reported that the last batch of Soviet reserve troops has been sent to the front. At present, there are about 9 million troops on both sides, which is more than the Western Front campaign last year. It can be said that it is unprecedented in history. The length of the front is also unprecedented. The decisive battle that follows will determine the fate of Europe for centuries to come.

Havas, a certain place on the Soviet border, 17th Twenty-six days have passed since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. Since the German troops broke through the Stalin Line, the city of Smolensk has been in imminent danger. It has now been occupied by the German troops, which is a major turning point in the German-Soviet war. According to historical facts, after Napoleon I's army occupied the city of Smolensk, it went straight to Moscow. Therefore, the general public is asking whether the German occupation of the city marks the successful conclusion of the German offensive. According to a German military spokesman today, there will be major developments soon. Berlin is also rumored that the German troops entered the suburbs of Kiev this afternoon, and street fighting has broken out there. Whether this statement is true or not is debatable, but it can be concluded that after the German troops broke through the Stalin Line, the Soviet Union's second line of defense suffered a major blow.

### German Forces Use Artificial Fog to Advance Towards the Kiev Fortress

United Press, Berlin, 18th The German war machine is advancing eastward under artificial fog in "the greatest struggle in world history." Yesterday, it was heard that it had occupied Smolensk and Chisinau, the three chief towns of Bessarabia, which is the last major line of defense for Kiev.

Havas, Berlin, 17th The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that after the Red Army in the Kiev region was defeated by the German troops, it repeatedly used armored vehicle units to cover a large-scale counterattack, attempting to prevent the German advance. The German troops in the central route continued to advance. After a fierce battle in the Orsha area, the German troops expanded their stronghold on the other side of the Dnieper River. The Red Army was forced to retreat and transferred reserve troops to the front. However, the German artillery constantly bombarded the Soviet positions and covered the infantry to advance forward.

### Germany Determined to Win or Lose: Outcome Uncertain

Reuters, London, 18th - As the threat to Leningrad reaches a critical stage, military experts here believe that the Germans are now using all their national strength in a "win or lose" struggle, attempting to defeat Soviet resistance and capture Leningrad and Moscow. The German high command, aware that the Soviet Union continues to make an orderly retreat eastward, destroying transportation and storage facilities along the way, making it impossible for the German army to advance, has exhausted all efforts to prepare for defeating the Soviet army. This German strategy must be carefully executed to maintain the need for a large amount of military supplies and requires great courage and determination. Although the German rear is restricted by transportation difficulties, it is generally believed that the German army can advance with the air force and armored divisions from the German border to the front lines. This is because the current Nazi plan is to use the power of the air force and armored divisions to attack. However, it is difficult for the German army to sustain such a massive operation for long. Experts believe that the outcome of this German tactic will soon be evident. Some experts also believe that if the German army fails to capture Leningrad and Moscow within three weeks, it will definitely fail. The German army is now trying to gain more strongholds in the south, so that it can control the railways and highways leading to Leningrad from the south and southeast, preparing for a direct attack. This German advance from the south may take place simultaneously with another army's advance across the Karelian Isthmus from the north. If the German army adopts a pincer attack strategy, Leningrad will be in extreme danger. However, it is generally expected that the Soviet army will put up fierce resistance at that time, and it is reported that Leningrad now has one million well-equipped Soviet troops. If the German claim of occupying Polotsk and Smolensk is true, then the area between these two places, Vitebsk, will probably also fall into German hands. The area between Vitebsk and Smolensk, the Dvina and Dnieper River section (gap), is the weakest part of the Soviet northern defense line, on the road to Moscow. If this triangular area is lost, then the Soviet railway line from north to south, in other words, the very long railway line from Leningrad via Vitebsk to Smolensk, and then from there to Kiev and Odessa, will also be lost.

### German and Finnish Forces Jointly Attack the Far Northern Front: Fierce Fighting

Havas, Stockholm, 17th

"Dagens Nyheter" reported that the joint German-Finnish forces under the command of German General Falkenhorst have penetrated into the Soviet territory of the Salla region on the far northern front and fierce fighting has already broken out. The Allied forces are attacking the cities of Kandalaksha and Kumo, and it is not yet known how far they have advanced. It is only known that they have not yet reached the railway from Leningrad to Murmansk, which has been bombed by the German Air Force, disrupting traffic. In addition, the Finnish army has begun an offensive on the Ladoga Lake front, attempting to cut off traffic in the Trokscha-Votersk district to contain the main force of the Red Army until the German army arrives near Leningrad.

Havas, Berlin, 17th - The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that the terrain of the Kola Peninsula is rugged and uneven, and the German army's progress is very slow. In addition, transportation is inconvenient, and it is extremely difficult to send reinforcements. Wounded soldiers on the front lines are being transported back by seaplane.

Havas, Helsinki, 17th - The Finnish Intelligence Bureau issued a battle report stating, "Our air force has assisted the army in combat, with great success. It has bombed enemy railway cars, armored trains, troops, and motorcades, and strafed the ground with machine guns. Soviet railway equipment has been destroyed, causing trains to stop, and troops have dispersed in all directions, while motorcades have caught fire and burned. Our aircraft have also been very successful in bombing Soviet artillery positions. The railway to Murmansk has also been bombed by our aircraft, with heavy losses, especially in the areas of Lolanmberto and Petroskaya."

### Soviet Air Force Appears to Hold the Advantage: Active Partisan Warfare Behind the Lines

Reuters, Moscow, 18th - Soviet Air Force Captain Gruzden wrote an article published in "Red Star" stating that Hitler has sent his best aircraft to participate in the Eastern Front campaign. However, the Soviet Air Force still holds the advantage in aerial combat. Soviet pilots are determined to destroy enemy aircraft whenever they encounter them, and will not allow them to escape. When German vanguard aircraft come into contact with Soviet fighters, they immediately flee. In order to encourage German pilots to fight to the death, the German command does not allow them to carry parachutes. However, even with large numbers, German aircraft may not gain any advantage.

Reuters, London, 17th - Moscow experts highly praised the Soviet fighter planes, saying that most of them are superior to the German Messerschmitt fighters, and the Soviet dive bombers are also quite good. The Germans have failed to gain permanent air superiority in any location, while the Soviet Air Force is always able to operate behind the lines, bombing rear traffic and transportation. The so-called guerrillas can be divided into two types: (1) large units of Soviet soldiers closely coordinated behind the main lines to cut off the supply of enemy tanks; (2) small units of Soviet soldiers operating far behind enemy lines, causing great trouble. It is not clear how these Soviet soldiers left in the retreat zone find food, as all food in the retreat zone has been destroyed.

Havas, Moscow, 18th - This evening, a radio station here broadcast a message stating that Soviet guerrillas in the German-occupied areas are becoming more active. In the Smelensk region, seven enemy tanks and many trucks have been destroyed. Enemy supply lines, railways, and telephone communications are also frequently disrupted.

### Moscow: People Remain Calm and Confident of Victory

Reuters, London, 17th - A Reuters correspondent in Moscow reports that the people of Moscow, upon hearing the news of the German advance, are not only not discouraged but also more determined than a week ago, believing that the eventual defeat of the German army after suffering setbacks is absolutely inevitable. This belief stems from the slow pace of the German advance and the impact of the Anglo-Soviet alliance. The situation in Moscow and the tone of Soviet propaganda both reflect this belief. Daily life in Moscow seems more normal than a week ago, with crowded theaters and cinemas, and riverside parks, restaurants, theatrical performances, and exhibitions all teeming with visitors.

### Soviet-Czech Agreement Signed in London

Reuters, London, 18th - According to "Soviet War News," a Soviet-Czech agreement was signed today at the Soviet embassy here, agreeing that the two governments will exchange diplomatic representatives and jointly fight against Germany under Hitler's rule. The agreement is written in both Russian and Czech. The signatories were the Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, and the Czech Foreign Minister, Masaryk.

### Greek Prime Minister Expresses Friendship to the Soviet Union

Reuters, London, 18th - The Greek Embassy in London recently released a statement by Greek Prime Minister Tsouderos upon his arrival in South Africa, stating that Greece has declared friendship and solidarity with the Soviet Union. Greece continues to fight for freedom and is not concerned about its views on the "current development and changes of socialist parties." Greece will do everything in its power to provide the Soviet Union with all kinds of assistance in this war against a common enemy.

### Hopkins Arrives in England to Discuss Aid to Britain; US Aircraft and Military Production Are Rapidly Increasing; Combined Efforts of Two Countries Will Overthrow Fascism

Reuters, London, 18th - Roosevelt's special envoy Hopkins, who is now in London, told visiting reporters today that he will stay in England for a week or ten days to discuss the entire issue of supplies to Britain and the Middle East with the British government and the US Ambassador, Winant. The production of US war equipment, especially aircraft and tanks, has increased rapidly. The United States is now undertaking the largest merchant ship construction program ever undertaken by any country, so that there will be sufficient ships to transport these goods to every country in the world fighting for democracy. The United States plans to complete one million tons of merchant ships this year, six million tons next year, and even more in 1943. Regarding munitions, we have embarked on a large aircraft production program, which is now progressing rapidly. Many new factories, especially those manufacturing four-engine heavy bombers, will soon be producing aircraft. These heavy bombers can fly to the easternmost parts of Germany and destroy its factories and sources of supply. We are confident that the number of these aircraft built in the United Kingdom and the United States will far exceed that of Germany, and their quality will also exceed that of Germany. The United States has also greatly increased the production of tanks and anti-tank guns. In short, US output is increasing daily and will expand to unimaginable levels in the future. The total production efforts of the United Kingdom and the United States must ensure that the supply of armaments is sufficient to overthrow the fascist dictators. Its sole purpose is to whip the blind followers. When a reporter asked whether the United States would protect its goods being transported across the Atlantic, Hopkins replied that President Roosevelt had stated that US goods would arrive safely. All he can say at present is that we will comply with this and we will protect these ships, but he cannot discuss the details.

### Turkey Denies Territorial Disputes with Bulgaria

Havas, Ankara, 18th - A radio station here recently broadcast a message denying rumors of territorial disputes between Turkey and Bulgaria, and stating that the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression treaty is still in effect, and the two countries are determined to maintain friendly relations.

### British Aircraft Active Over French Territory

Reuters, London, 18th - The British Air Ministry announced that yesterday, British fighter planes were active in the skies over northern France and the Channel. Two German fighters were shot down in the skies over northern France, and three German fighters were shot down over the Channel. Two British aircraft are also missing.

Reuters, Berlin, 18th - Berlin officials announced last night that yesterday afternoon, British aircraft, covered by a large number of fighter planes, attempted to intrude into French territory. They were attacked by German fighter planes. In addition to one British Blenheim aircraft being shot down by anti-aircraft guns, three Spitfire aircraft were shot down in aerial combat.

Reuters, London, 18th - Officials announced that on Wednesday night, British coastal aircraft attacked enemy ships. An enemy 6,000-ton oil tanker and a 3,500-ton supply ship are believed to have been sunk. Two other supply ships may also have been damaged.

### Prominent Bulgarian Figures to Visit Rome

Reuters, Rome, 18th - Officials announced today that Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov and Foreign Minister Popov will arrive here on July 21 for an official visit and will meet with Prime Minister Mussolini.

### New Cuban Cabinet Formed

Reuters, Havana, 18th - Cuban President Batista formed a new cabinet yesterday, retaining some old cabinet members, some of whom have been appointed to new positions. Former Cuban President Laredo Bru has been appointed as the Minister of Justice in the newly formed cabinet.

### Roosevelt Intensifies Economic Sanctions Against the Axis Powers: South American Merchants Trading with Germany and Italy Placed on Blacklist and No Longer Supplied with US Goods

Reuters, Washington, 18th - The United States recently announced the names of 1,800 merchants and firms in Latin America, prohibiting Americans from trading with them, in order to enhance national defense and block channels of export to Germany and Italy. This list was compiled after a long-term investigation by the US Department of State, Treasury, Justice, Commerce, and Export Control Board. It will be added to or subtracted from at any time in the future.

Reuters, Washington, 18th - President Roosevelt announced yesterday a "blacklist" of 1,800 Latin American individuals and businesses, prohibiting US businesses from exporting goods to them. This move is clearly an economic blow to the Axis powers. The blacklist is the result of a long-term investigation and includes all businesses suspected of "acting as front-line agents" for totalitarian groups. It is claimed that the purpose of this move is to prevent interference in legitimate Pan-American commerce. The list includes those "acting in the interests of Germany and Italy. If goods are exported to them, it would harm national defense interests. The businesses include German and Italian banks, chemical plants, management offices, arms companies, photographic material companies, public utilities, and airlines."

### White House Convenes Meeting to Discuss the Overall Situation in the Far East: Four Navy Leaders Invited to Participate; Joint Anglo-American Action to Prevent Japanese Advance Southward

Reuters, Washington, 18th - President Roosevelt convened a meeting of key naval advisors on Thursday evening. Those present included Secretary of the Navy Knox, Chief of Naval Operations Stark, Commander of the Atlantic Fleet Rear Admiral King, and Director of Naval Operations Tactical Division Rear Admiral Turner.

Reuters, Washington, 18th - It is generally believed that the overall situation in the Far East was also discussed at the meeting of naval advisors convened by President Roosevelt on Thursday. However, those present refused to disclose any information.

Reuters, Washington, 18th - Assistant Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that he could not comment on the overall situation in the Far East because the information he received about developments was very fragmentary. When asked whether US Ambassador to Japan Grew had sent any information, Welles replied that he had received many different messages. When asked whether he could reveal anything about his meeting with President Roosevelt yesterday morning, Welles replied that he had only given the President several pieces of information.

Reuters, London, 17th - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that regarding reports circulating abroad that Japan is now putting pressure on Vichy to give up its base in Vietnam, British officials said today that the same news had been received in Shanghai earlier this month. The British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, questioned the Japanese authorities about this, and the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs immediately stated firmly that this was incorrect. British officials also said that if Japan disregarded its statement and established bases in Cam Ranh Bay and other places by means of pressure, threats, or military force, this step would bring Japan closer to the territories of other countries. London and Washington are still closely monitoring the situation as before. What the British Commander-in-Chief, Brooke-Popham, told a Reuters reporter in Singapore yesterday shows that the British authorities in the Far East are fully prepared. Regarding the resignation of the Japanese cabinet, no criticism can be made at this time. However, according to news from Tokyo, the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet is aimed at establishing a more powerful government to deal with domestic and international situations. Japan has recently shown signs that are causing the Japanese people to have both expectations and anxieties about the future, such as the closure of Kobe, Japan's second largest port, for ten days, the conscription of reservists, and the movement of troops. All of these things make the claim that Japan is putting pressure on Vichy more credible. Although Germany would rather see Japan cause trouble on the Soviet Union's back door, it cannot at this time help its Vichy puppet and oppose its Far East Axis partner.

Reuters, Manila, 18th - Although observers have expressed the view that Japan will move south to Vietnam within a few weeks, responsible military circles are unwilling to discuss the rumors about Japan's intentions and its southward movements. Since 1931, the cornerstone of Japan's international policy has been nothing more than external expansion. Over the past decade, the trend of expansion has been clearly southward. There is now an excellent opportunity to advance deeply south without a fight, because the Syrian crisis has shown the collapse of French territories, and even if the French want to defend Vietnam, they cannot. Knowledgeable people generally believe that Japan will take Vietnam within a few weeks and seize its military strongholds, such as Cam Ranh Bay, because Japan has the power to do so without causing a conflict with the democratic countries. The change in the Japanese cabinet was probably caused by the militarists who advocated aggression. This is also evidence that Japan is about to take action. In addition, there are other signs, namely, the recent movement of Japanese troops and the requisition of Japanese merchant ships. Japan is now in urgent need of foreign exchange, and would never requisition merchant ships without extremely good reason, causing itself a huge financial loss. Moreover, if it is not transporting many troops, it does not need so many ships. However, Japan is now requisitioning a large number of merchant ships, which shows that it wants to station 100,000 to 125,000 troops in southern Vietnam to guard against Britain and Thailand, and to have a military base as a foundation for future incursions into Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. Although an attack on Malaya cannot be realized in the short term, Japan may as well wait. The reason is that Vietnam is quite wide, and can be temporarily included. According to knowledgeable sources, Japan will not gain anything if it attacks Siberia at this time, so it will not advance north. If the Soviet Union is what Germany wants, if the Soviet-German war drags on, then the Soviet Union will inevitably withdraw its Far East garrison to secure its western border, and Japan will be in a better position to attack at that time. From an overall point of view, the date of Japan's southward advance is probably not far away. The main reason is that the democratic countries are willing to fight for France, but if Japan attacks Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaya, or the Dutch East Indies, it will inevitably cause rapid action on the part of the democratic countries.

### The United States Has Recently Launched Twenty-Two Warships

Reuters, New York, 18th - The US Navy Department said that in the four weeks ending July 10, 22 US ships were launched, including one South Dakota-class battleship, two destroyers, one submarine, seven high-speed motor torpedo boats, and several other small warships. Also in these four weeks, the US shipyard began building new ships, almost one every day.

### US Army Chief of Staff Advises the United States to Prepare for War: A Tragic Situation Will Come to the Western Hemisphere; US Congress Should Declare a National Emergency

Reuters, Washington, 18th - Army Chief of Staff General Marshall told the Senate Military Committee yesterday that the Army now foresees that Spain, Portugal, and Africa will fall into the hands of the Axis powers one after another, and warned that the United States is encountering a "tragic situation" unless the United States is prepared for war. He said that the world today is encountering a "huge military operation." This military operation began in Austria and has now extended to the Soviet Union. This war machine is launched in one place at a time, and other countries that are not affected are hypnotized by treaties and trade agreements. Undoubtedly, if we are not prepared for war, a tragic situation will befall us. We cannot risk our own security. Marshall said that the Army has always adopted a conservative policy, but has always been prepared for tit-for-tat actions against the Hitler government. He said that there are rumors that Germany has 300 army divisions, 20 of which are armored units. He also said that the United States is now providing financial resources to Brazil to expand its air force, so that the Western Hemisphere is under close protection to deal with "a rogue country." He also said that the US sailors who occupied Iceland did so because the US Army lacked officers sufficient for other transfers, and the Army's current recruits and reservists do not have legal permission to be transferred outside the Western Hemisphere. General Marshall also said that August 1 is the deadline for Congress to accept or reject the extension of the service period of recruits and the National Guard.

Reuters, Washington, 18th - Army Chief of Staff Marshall also presented his views to the Senate Military Committee, strongly stating the absolute necessity, from a military standpoint, for Congress to declare a state of national emergency so that the one-year term of enlistment for soldiers can be extended. Marshall said, "We only started last year to carry out what we can make people amazed at. We can reach a strong position to protect all our interests. It would be unwise to stop halfway, because from the Army Department's point of view, the current situation is extremely serious, but the Army Department cannot publish its information on recent developments." If the enlistment period is limited to one year, the Army Department will not be able to cope with it comfortably. The Army Department has not yet been able to send a squadron of 24 fighter planes to Iceland to increase the strength of the sailors there. It is absurd to say that he intends to organize an overseas expeditionary force.

### British Public Expresses Goodwill Towards Soviet Ambassador

Reuters, London, 18th - Last night, Soviet Ambassador Maisky went to the Albert Hall concert. After the orchestra played music by famous Russian composers, the ambassador left the hall and was surrounded by the crowd, who cheered unanimously.

### United States Completes Two More Naval Bases: One in Newfoundland and One in Trinidad; Available for Fleet Berthing and Repair

Reuters, Washington, 18th - The US Navy Department announced last night that the United States will use two naval bases with complete deployments, one in Newfoundland and one in Trinidad. These two places will provide convenience for accommodating and repairing warships in the Atlantic. The Navy Department previously announced that the Newfoundland base was only a naval aircraft station, but today the Navy said that it can accommodate a fleet and allow battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, etc. to have the convenience of adding fuel and repairs. The cost of the Newfoundland base is $17,855,000. Both of these places are within the eight places leased from Britain.

### Lindbergh Dissatisfied with Interior Secretary's Remarks; Writes to President Roosevelt Demanding That Ickes Apologize

Reuters, Washington, 18th - US Interior Secretary Ickes said on French National Day, July 14, that "studying the methods used by Hitler to disintegrate the internal organization and morale of other countries can make us understand how harmful Lindbergh and others are to the country." Ickes also referred to Lindbergh as a German nobleman and said that Lindbergh's remarks encouraged Hitler and undermined the willingness of the people to resist Nazism. Lindbergh has now written to the President, demanding that Ickes apologize, and declaring that he has no relationship with any foreign government. His receipt of medals was when he was working at the US Embassy. Ickes recently told reporters that he had never said that Lindbergh had a relationship with a foreign government. He only said that Lindbergh went to various places in the country to promote appeasement, shaking national unity, which was beneficial to the German government. Lindbergh should have returned his German Order long ago, regardless of how, when, or where he got it.

### Japanese Newspaper Believes Mexican Embargo Is Clearly Aimed at Japan

Reuters, Tokyo, 18th - Today's Miyako Shimbun commented that Mexico's ban on the export of major goods to countries outside the Western Hemisphere was actually initiated by the United States behind the scenes. The newspaper said, "This move is clearly aimed at Japan, because only Japan buys these goods outside of the Americas. Japan should lodge a strong protest with Mexico regarding this matter."

### US Public Approves of the Occupation of Iceland: According to Public Opinion Poll Results

### North Ireland Permits Free Action by the US

United Press, Belfast, 18th‚ÄîAndrew, in Northern Ireland, gave the United States freedom of action in Northern Ireland yesterday.

Regarding the presence of American troops in Northern Ireland, Andrew declined to elaborate, but when asked his opinion on the United States entering the war, he said, "The sooner, the better."

### Current Status of the US Naval Expansion

The United States is expanding its navy at a feverish pace. The United States currently has a total of fifteen battleships, three newly completed, and fourteen under construction. There are currently thirty-seven first-line cruisers, with fifty-four under construction. There are currently six aircraft carriers, with twelve under construction. As for destroyers, in addition to the ninety old ones given to the United Kingdom, there are still one hundred and sixty-four, with seventy-eight under construction, including the "Tudor Greig" and others with a displacement of 1,750 tons, comparable to destroyers. In addition, there are countless torpedo boats.

The construction of battleships has always been considered the largest and most time-consuming project. In the first half of this year alone, three ships were completed in one go, all five or six months ahead of schedule, which is truly a remarkable achievement. One ship, the "North Carolina," was launched in April at the New York Brooklyn Navy Yard; another, the "Washington," was launched in May in Philadelphia; and the third, the "South Dakota," was launched in early June in Camden, New Jersey, each with a displacement of 35,000 tons. Three of the seventeen new battleships for the US two-ocean fleet have now been completed.

Since the United States Navy built the battleship "Maryland" in December 1923, there had been no major achievements. The "North Carolina" being the first to be completed marks a new era in the history of the United States Navy. The keel of the ship was laid on Navy Day, October 27, 1937, and was originally scheduled to be completed by September 1 this year, but it was completed five months ahead of schedule. The cost was originally estimated at $67,725,500, but the total cost after completion will likely reach $70 million. The ship has a crew of 1,500 officers and men.

After the "North Carolina," "Washington," and "South Dakota" are completed successively, they should be formally incorporated into the fleet by July, at which time the United States Navy will have a total of eighteen battleships, which can be said to be unparalleled in the world in terms of quality. However, the advantage in quantity may not last long. The United Kingdom originally had fifteen battleships, and the three new ones will be completed soon. By the end of the year, Japan will also have completed two new battleships, bringing the total number of battleships to twelve.

The total number of battleships currently owned by the world's naval powers and those that can be built by the end of this year is roughly as follows:

Country      Current Ships     Ships by Year-End

USA          15 ships          18 ships

UK           15 ships          17 or 18 ships

Japan        10 ships          12 ships

Germany      4 ships           4 ships

Italy        5-6 ships        5-6 ships

USSR         3 ships           3 ships

France       2 ships           2 ships

The above table does not include the battleships that the United Kingdom has lost, such as the "Hood." In addition to first-line battleships, Germany also has one pocket battleship (the "Bismarck" was recently sunk by the United Kingdom) and two old battleships converted into training ships. The French "Dunkerque" and "Strasbourg" were severely damaged in Mers-el-K√©bir and have likely been repaired. The remaining French battleships are probably all there are.

In terms of the quality of American battleships, no other country can match them. The "North Carolina" and its sister ships have a standard displacement of 35,000 tons (actual displacement of about 38,000 to 39,500 tons); the hull is 704 feet long and 108 feet wide at the waterline (only two feet narrower than the existing locks of the Panama Canal), with an average draft of 26 feet 8 inches.

The ship is equipped with nine 16-inch diameter, 45-caliber guns, divided into three triple turrets, capable of firing about 20 tons of shells per minute at targets 15 miles away. The engine is a four-screw propeller, with double rudders at the stern.

The ship's four sets of engines can generate 115,000 horsepower, with a speed of over 27 knots per hour. The giant auxiliary guns are used to attack ships and aircraft, and various small-caliber anti-aircraft guns are mounted everywhere. It usually carries three reconnaissance aircraft, which can be increased if necessary. The armor all over the ship can withstand 16-inch diameter shells and aircraft bombs at battle distances. In addition to triple armor on the bottom of the ship, there is also a density distribution system to assess the extent of damage from torpedoes or mines.

The "North Carolina" is more powerful than the newly built British "King George V." The American ship is equipped with nine 16-inch guns, while the British ship is only equipped with ten 14-inch guns. The auxiliary guns of the American ship are particularly powerful. The British ship may be one or two knots faster than the American ship, but the armor of the American ship is thicker.

The "North Carolina" is clearly superior to the French "Dunkerque" and "Strasbourg" (displacement of 26,500 tons, equipped with eight 13-inch guns) and the German "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" (displacement of 26,000 tons, equipped with nine 11-inch guns).

The German new battleships "Bismarck" (already sunk by the United Kingdom) and "Tirpitz" are 730 feet long, 26 feet longer than the "North Carolina," and 118 feet wide, exceeding the American ship by 10 feet. The width of the hull of other countries' ships is unmatched. The ship is equipped with eight 15-inch guns, the firepower of which is not as strong as the nine 16-inch guns of the American ship, but they are divided into four turrets, making it easier to disperse the firepower. The auxiliary guns of the American ship are superior to those of the German ship, but the German ship is faster. The German ship has a displacement of 35,000 tons, with an average load of 37,500 tons.

The details of the new ships being built in Japan are unknown, but they are expected to be larger than the "North Carolina" class, with a displacement of around 40,000 tons, equipped with eight or nine 16-inch guns, and a speed of 29 to 30 knots per hour.

The "North Carolina" and its sister ships "Washington" and "South Dakota" are about to be incorporated into the United States First Fleet. Currently, the United States Pacific Fleet has twelve battleships, effectively all that it possesses, while the Atlantic Fleet has three older battleships with limited firepower. With the addition of these new forces, the strength of the United States in both oceans will be significantly enhanced.

### Finance: Unpredictable Foreign Exchange, Japanese Merchants Entering and Exiting Abruptly, Speculation Turning from Buying to Selling

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the exchange rates quoted by HSBC. The gray market for British and American currency suddenly tightened, due to fewer US dollars being released by Japanese banks. Later, they stopped selling and instead aggressively bought British currency. Speculators began to buy on speculation, aggressively buying 400,000 to 500,000 yuan of US dollars. The price of gold had already soared past the 6,500 yuan mark, contributing to the tightening trend. Although foreign banks like Favorably and others were still supplying, the tightening trend became even more pronounced at noon. In the afternoon, the US dollar softened to 5.3125 yuan. Unexpectedly, Japanese banks began selling again, and speculators followed suit, causing the market to turn stronger again. Spot prices of 5.0375 yuan were briefly difficult to sell, and both British and American currency ultimately remained tight. Overall, trading was extremely active.

Tightening Trend Even Sharper at Noon

Since the morning's foreign telegrams showed flat tin prices and stable exchange rates in various countries compared to Shanghai, the Central Bank's quoted exchange rates were also flat. The domestic market opened early with bank selling prices of 3 pence 28125 for spot British currency, and 5.40625 yuan for US dollars. Japanese banks initially sold August US dollars at 5.40625 yuan, creating a softening trend. Foreign banks traded July currency among themselves at the same price. HSBC's small counter quoted US dollars at 5.375 yuan, allowing the black market to settle August currency at 5.40625 yuan again. Later, Japanese banks stopped selling, and speculators started buying aggressively, reaching 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, at a price of 5.375 yuan, supplied by foreign banks such as Favorably. At noon, HSBC's small counter reduced US dollar quotes by 0.0625, to 5.3125 yuan. The gray market tightening trend became even sharper, and banks became less willing to supply. The noon closing price for British gold was 3 pence 234375, and 5.34375 yuan for US dollars.

The Market Gradually Stabilized at Closing

In the early afternoon, the price of gold continued to rise, so the US dollar softened to a tight price of 5.3125 yuan. Soon, Japanese banks began selling aggressively, and speculators turned to selling, selling to China Bank at 5.34375 yuan for August US dollars. Japanese banks then offered spot US dollars at 5.375 yuan, turning the market from tight to flat. At the 3:30 closing, both spot and August futures for British currency were at 3 pence 234375, and 5.34375 yuan for US dollars. Compared to the previous day's closing price, British currency tightened by 0.046875 and US dollars tightened by 0.0625.

### Gold Prices Rising Sharply, Hovering Around 6,500 Yuan, Swap Premiums Have Decreased

Yesterday's gold market saw active trading and rising prices, but reversed before the late closing. After breaking through the 6,500 yuan mark, it re-entered, and the mood of various parties seemed uncertain. This was due to the US dollar easing as Japanese banks resumed aggressive selling, causing the buying on speculation to cease abruptly. Since the market opened high in the morning, rumors spread that the Exchange Equalization Account would only maintain the local US dollar exchange rate at 5.25 yuan, that the Central Bank would increase the issuance of banknotes, and that a certain party would take over the court. In addition, the foreign exchange market tightened sharply due to Japanese banks briefly halting sales. The Shanghai West gang and securities firms in the market added to their positions and aggressively bought, causing prices to rise from 6,455 yuan. At noon, it broke out of the 6,500 yuan mark. In the afternoon, Hong Kong telegrams indicated the addition of a thousand taels, further increasing the upward momentum, reaching 6,535 yuan. Unexpectedly, the US dollar eased again due to Japanese banks selling, and rumors arose that a new cabinet would be formed in Japan and would advance in a favorable direction. The Shanghai West gang reduced their positions, scattered notes were settled, and prices reversed, falling by more than 40 yuan to below 6,500 yuan. However, the result was still a rise of 52 yuan. Total trading volume was more than 100,000 taels. The swap premium (July to August) was lowered by the seller to the buyer, with the premium falling to 50 yuan. Cash was in short supply all day, with prices 4562 yuan higher than the goods, an increase of over 40 yuan from the previous day. Jewelry was listed higher by 5 yuan, totaling 715 yuan.

Futures Recovered Quickly

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially continued the previous day's upward momentum, and the opening was immediately buoyed by buying, rising 42 yuan to 6,480 yuan. After Shanghai West Gu released supply, firms like Chengji, Deda, Xinfengyong, and Litai sold, and the market slightly decreased by 25 yuan. Around 10 o'clock, it advanced to 6,455 yuan. Litai, Tongkang Yongyi Yuan, and Hongqingyong bought, and upon hearing that speculators were aggressively buying August US dollars at 5.375 yuan, the market rallied, immediately rising 40 yuan, reaching 6,495 yuan. Xiangxingyong and Yinhao retreated to 6,477 yuan. After 11 o'clock, the foreign exchange market tightened further, and under the favorable rumors, Yiyuan started aggressively buying again. Chengda, Xinfengyong, Yida, Hongqingyong, and Dingsheng bought even more aggressively, increasing the upward momentum, suddenly soaring out of the 6,500 yuan mark, reaching 6,518 yuan, at which point Yifeng, Defu, and Dafeng sold, causing a small setback. The noon closing price was 6,510 yuan. The afternoon opening price was 6,515 yuan, 5 yuan higher. Tianyuan, Hengji, Yida, and Defu aggressively bought, continuing to push the price up to 6,535 yuan. Suddenly, it was heard that Japanese banks were selling US dollars again, causing a reversal and easing, and the market declined. Yiyuan and Xiangxingyong released supply, while Tongkangyong and Yida all sold, and the price gradually decreased by over 40 yuan, falling below 6,500 yuan, retreating to 6,487 yuan. The 3:30 closing price was 6,490 yuan, a recovery of 52 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Based on the closing price of 5.34375 yuan for August US dollars, it was 6,517 yuan, a difference of 27 yuan. After the closing, Shanghai West Gu resumed buying, and the final price was 6,4989 yuan. The total price range for the day was 80 yuan. The gold price for the main brand was 470 yuan higher than the futures price, and the purchase price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for current spot gold.

Jewelry Heavily Listed Again

The exchange price for silver jewelry per tael was increased by 5 yuan at 11:30 in the morning by Datonghang and Xintonghang, totaling 715 yuan, with a 40 yuan reduction for purchases.

### Foreign Currency Recovered Strongly, US Dollar Futures Calculated in Hundreds of Yuan

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw strong prices, with British and American pounds rising by one yuan each. British gold notes remained unchanged, and market prices were stable. US dollar futures opened at 1,856 yuan (hereafter calculated per 100 US dollars). After opening, it retreated to 55 yuan, but then suddenly Zhihe, Liji, Chengfeng, Zhengda, Lianhe, Dongsheng, Heng, and others competed to buy, raising the price to 1,871 yuan at the closing.

### Yarn and Cotton: Stagnant Hong Kong Sales, Double Horse Yarn Rising, Rumored Support from Bullish Companies, Tight Supply for Short Covering at the End of the Month

The yarn market has been in a chaotic state recently. Despite strong sales, market prices have declined. Spot transactions are clear, but the market has been able to rise, making people feel uncertain. In reality, a portion of large players are intermittently buying and selling Double Horse factory orders. Small speculators generally follow the trend, frequently suffering losses, so the trend of rotation is quite strong. There is also the idea that the market had the potential to decline, but was unfortunately held up by a group of bullish companies. Four major firms joined together to squeeze factory orders, thus supporting the market situation. But another argument is that, from 1,372 yuan all the way to the peak of 1,645 yuan, several large volumes of short sales were only sold around 1,400 yuan. Unexpectedly, a batch of transactions came from the Cantonese community, and as a result, the market gradually rose, and the short-sellers were unable to support it and went bankrupt. However, the amount of short sales is currently very small, and in addition, they were not able to cover sufficiently at the lower end. Although there is a bullish group, there is a lack of chips to squeeze. In light of this, actual sales are flourishing, and the foundation should be solid, otherwise there may be a reversal. Bulls posted a swap premium of one and a half yuan, with the final price at 7.5 cents. Shorts collected profit. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,594 yuan, and the low price was 1,587 yuan. Early afternoon trading was at 1,596 yuan, rising to 1,607 yuan, and the final price was 1,601.2 yuan.

Double Horse opened strong in the morning due to the presence of bullish companies. Retail investors rushed to cover, and the opening price was 1,589 yuan, rising directly to 1,594 yuan. Later, due to flat spot gold, sales of 20-count yarn remained unchanged. The Hong Kong community only bought 65 bales of 32-count yarn, and morale was flat, falling to 1,587 yuan. The closing price was 1,592 yuan, and after-hours trading was at 94 yuan. Statistics show that 6,565 bales were traded in half a day. The amount of purchases by each community is listed below: Hong Kong: 65; Counterparts: 6,500.

Total: 6,565

The futures market situation for Golden Double Horse yarn: In the early morning opening, the atmosphere of the foreign exchange and gold prices rose sharply, and because the current period was coming to an end, short holders generally covered their positions, so the rise was quite sharp. The July contract rose 10 yuan from yesterday, and the August contract rose 8 yuan. Selling was slightly turned over in September, falling only 5 and a half yuan. After the opening, it was suddenly heard that the price of US cotton was mixed, Indian cotton fell, and the needs of the Hong Kong community were like a standstill. The long again turned to selling, and the July contract once fell to 1,436 yuan, the August contract to 1,452 and a half yuan, and the September contract was stable. After the entry, the price of gold was very strong, new buying and short covering rose frequently, and the price re-trended upward. The noon close was 10 yuan for July, 8 yuan for August, and 4 and a half yuan for September, with a turnover of 7,970 bales. It was later rumored that someone would take over the association. The July price once reached 1,445 yuan, the August contract 1,466 yuan, and the September contract 1,524 and a half yuan. The price increased first and then returned, and the result was 9 yuan for the July increase and 10 yuan for August from the previous day. The September contract was up 6 yuan, and the total daily turnover was 13,420 bales, a decrease of 2,110 bales from the previous day. The full-day opening, closing, high and low prices are recorded (net offer).

### Indian Cotton Transactions Extremely Active

Although the spot cotton situation is firm, the factory transactions are not strong. However, morale is still very good, but the price of fine lint cotton has reached a considerable height, and sales have been reduced. The goal of speculative trading has been transferred to coarse lint.

Another message is that the foreign cotton ordering transactions of Shanghai foreign firms were exciting and eager. All parties were very keen on trading spot cotton, seeing that the ordering of US Indian cotton was cumbersome. At the same time, the city's situation is becoming firm due to the need for factories. In addition to the resale of large quantities of Indian and Brazilian cotton by peers, each factory has also transacted nearly a thousand bales of cotton on a daily basis.

The New York cotton market fell due to speculative selling, but then rose again due to buying by peers and foreign merchants. As a result, closing prices were up or down two to three points from the previous day.

The Indian cotton market was quite bland, falling due to speculative selling and a chaotic situation in the Far East. Yesterday's closing prices fell by two to three rupees each.

It is also predicted that today's opening will be up 0.75 rupees.

### Piece Goods: Best-Selling Block Printed Cloths

The factory cloth market was stable yesterday, and morale was firm. The selling of each cloth was slightly less than usual, but there were various goods, such as Qiankun printed gold three-tower bleached cloth and Yihuo Lun Chang factory, and the goods sold mostly increased. The sale of thin twill cloth was less powerful and was unable to rise, and the spot market transaction for each cloth this street was more than 500 pieces, and the transaction for flannel was gradually increasing. The South Ocean and Hong Kong community handled dyed printed cloths of about 10,000 pieces, and 250 pieces were transported to Yantai, and another five pieces were transported to Weihaiwei. Yesterday, 850 pieces were transported to Hong Kong.

Yesterday, Dongbu went to the local and North Korean offices to deal with spot, and there was a high demand for narrow cloths. The company paid special attention to the product, and it strengthened. Each piece increased by 50 to 75 cents. Longtou's late price of a thin cloth factory order was 49 yuan and 25 cents, and it only increased by 25 cents, but the futures rose sharply in the exchange, and the result was a rise of 70 to 80 cents from the previous day. The morning price of the color goods Four Gentlemen Serge rose by one yuan and 61 and a half cents, and the later market reversed slightly by one yuan and 61 cents.

### Woolen Cloth Scraps - Can Also Be Sold

Wool prices are getting higher and higher, and a new business has been found, which is the use of waste. People are being sent out to collect scraps of wool, with the price of 3 yuan and 50 cents per catty for first-class (dismantled wool scraps) and 2 yuan and 78 cents per catty for second-class (tailor's wool scraps).

### Food: Floating Yang Rice, The Min Party Is Tired

Yang rice is constantly arriving in ports. The Taigu Company's Suzhou wheel was informed in the past that it arrived in Shanghai on the 17th from Hong Kong with 22,000 bags of Yang rice. The (ancestor) berthed near Pudong for import, and yesterday it was transferred to the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Today, 2,400 bags of maize will be transported to Yantai on the Taigu Company's Shuntian wheel.

Yesterday, the daily volatility of Yang rice was relatively flat. Since the rise and fall were small, speculators felt that their heroism was useless, and most large households watched with their arms folded. Floating households and retail customers still rose and fell with the market, but the actual elimination was greatly reduced, and the market finally saw smoothness and no surprises. The daily initial decline and then rise was only about half a yuan, and the trading volume was clear. In total, there were less than 10,000 bags in stock. Yinhua Temple still has more than 1,000 tons, and although speculative big customers have not cleared their minds, small customers have taken advantage of the low price to pull in. The early market opened with each Yang rice for the early phase compared to the previous day. After a drop of half a yuan, the market was fatigued and then pulled again, and the result was no difference. Only Yinhua Temple was a little more active, and the current rice was leveled by Hong Kong rice. Yinhua Temple was more active. The next term was at 149 yuan, the current was at 148 yuan and 20 to 30 cents, the scrap meter road was at 160 yuan and 50 to 60 cents, and number 2 Siamese rice was at 139 yuan and 50 cents to 140 yuan. It is now sold from 120 yuan and 50 cents to 119 yuan. The second is 117 yuan and 50 cents, number 1 Saigon is 128 yuan to 127 yuan and 50 cents, and the second is 126 yuan. Number 2 is 120 yuan to 119 yuan and 50 cents, the second is 116 yuan, and the scrap meter is 93 yuan to 91 yuan and 50 cents, the second is 89 yuan, and number 3 is 80 yuan. Due to the shutdown of the countryside and the small sales, the Min Party was also abruptly rubbed against by Pingmi yesterday, resulting in an unusually weak and tired state, depreciating 20 to 30 yuan. If the special goods were only 131 yuan, the general goods were 167 yuan, and the port clearance was 134 yuan.

The thick and thin Japanese rice and the Guoyang glutinous rice market both saw Yang rice return to flat, and the people were consistent and tended to stabilize. The supply and demand are similar, and all kept the original disk. The freshly opened fresh early and late rice from Nangang was 141 yuan and 50 cents, to 139 yuan. The Wuxi white japonica was 133 yuan, and the aged japonica was 130 yuan. The Hong Kong glutinous rice was 100 yuan. The high point was 123 yuan and 50 cents, the second point was 118 yuan, the glutinous lvk was 1134 yuan, and the Jindan was 1234 yuan. The second point was 1134 yuan.

### The Powder Market Has Seen A Slight Turn For The Better

Yesterday's spot Yangfen market situation saw a slight improvement. Due to the continuous fatigue, the price position gradually decreased, and this customer actually sold, and slightly entered at a low price. The hoarding households also intended to launch in view of the exchange rate and the price of gold. Therefore, the market turned from fatigue to firm. It is estimated that Jinlongfen was 31 yuan and 90 cents to 32 yuan, and Pao Tai Fen was 32 yuan and 80 cents to 80 cents. The total transaction was 10,000 packs. There were not many miscellaneous brand transactions. It was heard that there were people who directly matched customers, and the price was also firm, and the market gradually consolidated. There is still no market for wheat.

### Securities: Public Bonds Still Hover

Public bonds on the unofficial market hovered between five and six jiao yesterday. The market price has fallen for three consecutive days, but Category C bonds have consistently failed to break through the one-yuan mark. The strength of the bulls can be seen here. Yesterday, sellers gradually felt weak, and some bears have already covered their positions. The situation for those receiving interest this period is gradually stabilizing, and even if there is a transfer, there are no major discrepancies. The market price trend may be moderately stable. Yesterday morning, Ding Kang Hong Da aggressively covered shorts, while Xie Kang Xie and Yuan bought more aggressively. Shuntai Xinfu Yichang went long, while Lianhe Runli Zhongyi and No. 16 sold. The morning session closed slightly firm. In the afternoon, it gradually felt stable, fluctuating only by one or two jiao. Lianhe bought back, Jiufeng slightly covered positions, and Yitai slightly absorbed supply. Renfeng Runde also made considerable purchases. Hongda's He Ji, Xinchang, Shengda, and No. 38 sold. Major bullish players shifted positions, gradually stabilizing. As a result, the market price, except for Category D bonds which remained unchanged, all others showed only slight changes of about five fen or one jiao. The turnover was estimated at about 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Stock trading: 100 shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded at a price of 82 yuan and one jiao.

Various Industries: The stock market's activity has not diminished, and general prices are higher than the previous close, but the trend is still difficult to determine. Rubber stocks are stagnant and not firm.

London, 17th (Thursday) Cable: Today, the listed market prices of foreign government bonds and Far Eastern companies' stocks were all calm, with no changes in quotations.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Japanese Merchants Buying White Corn, Yellow Soybean Land Prices Reportedly Rising

Corn: Yesterday's market was sluggish and then surged, due to a sudden large-scale purchase by the Japanese. They successively purchased over 3,000 bags of white corn, which boosted confidence, and prices surged by more than two yuan. The rest followed, rising by half a yuan to more than one yuan. The prices were as follows: Holland white corn, priced at 25.5 to 27.5 yuan; Yinghua Si, 48 yuan; yellow corn, 27.3 to 28 yuan; Saigon corn, 26.5 yuan; and new corn, 26.7 to 27 yuan. The total transaction volume reached more than 6,000 bags.

Yellow Soybeans: Japanese merchants have been continuously selling well, and with land prices in Tianjin reportedly rising, customers have been frequently buying in, so morale is high. Yesterday, 500 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan, over 400 bags of Jiaozhou yellow soybeans, and nearly 1,000 bags of Guide yellow soybeans were sold, and prices surged again by about half a yuan.

Exports: Yesterday (18th), there were 515 bags of soybeans, 3,000 pieces of soybean cakes, and 1,020 bags of sesame seeds shipped to Hong Kong.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Southern Dried Longan Suddenly Surges

Hainan dried longan: It is reported that the new crop has a poor harvest, and the stock in Shanghai is also low, so customers are unanimously optimistic. Sellers have only a small amount left, and prices rose again by forty or fifty. Dozens of pieces were traded. Market prices followed, and cold storage goods were even more firm and popular.

### Seafood: Dried Fish Maws Expensive, Old Jellyfish Heads Firm

Dried fish maws are expensive because of difficulties in sourcing. Although the new crop has already appeared on the market, prices remain high: Ningbo goods 250 yuan, Zhoushan goods 410 yuan, Yantai goods 340 yuan.

Jellyfish heads and jellyfish skins: Old goods are better, so old goods are firm and new goods are weak. Yesterday, new jellyfish skins were 120 yuan, Dong goods were 150 yuan, new jellyfish heads were 80 yuan, and Sun goods were 125 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fluctuate Very Little

Yesterday, there was not much fluctuation in the sugar market. The Association's spot market: current two-four raw white sugar for February arrival was 93 yuan, March arrival was 93 yuan to 93.45 yuan, April arrival was 94 yuan, June arrival was 96 yuan, July 20th delivery was 96.1 yuan, all showing slight increases.

In addition, 3,000 bags will be shipped to Tianjin today (19th).

### Metals: Wire Rods Look Promising

The recent market conditions for new wire rods are considered very good, due to the impact of the continued interruption of overseas supplies. Moreover, nail factories, wire drawing factories, and machinery factories in this street have the intention to purchase frequently, and the turnover is not sluggish. The industry is in high spirits. Looking at the future trend of this commodity, the market is promising due to supply issues. Standard quotations are also rising. Yesterday, good quality goods were sold for 235 yuan per dan (unit of weight), while ordinary goods were quoted at around 225 yuan, about 5 to 10 yuan higher than the previous market.

### With Social Welfare as the Premise: Gas Company Reduces Surcharges, Company Voluntarily Implements, Perseverance Worthy of Praise, Other Public Utilities Should Emulate, Motion Already Declared Passed by the Public Utilities Committee

On the afternoon of the 17th of this month, when the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council held a meeting, it discussed a proposal that made people happy to hear about, namely, the suggestion of the Shanghai British-owned Gas Company to reduce surcharges. After the proposal was put forward, it was carefully discussed by the committee, and it was unanimously agreed that since the price reduction was voluntarily implemented by the company, there was no reason to prevent it, and it was immediately declared passed.

Surcharge Reduced by About 35%

Afterwards, reporters learned from well-informed sources that the amount of the surcharge that the gas company requested to reduce was about 35%. According to the company, the surcharge was levied at 250%. Although the reduced amount is small, at a time when various public utilities are repeatedly increasing prices, only the gas company is able to consider the burden on users and resolutely announce a price reduction. Its spirit of considering the public interest will undoubtedly win the sympathy and admiration of the citizens. It is said that the company's reason for implementing the price reduction is the rationalization of production equipment and the increase in the production of by-products, that is, the result of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure.

Public Utilities Should Emulate

As a result, the general public is reminded of the price increases of other public utilities in the International Settlement, especially the recent increase of more than 60% in tram and bus fares, which has caused a new and heavy burden on life. Although the general public has repeatedly given advice to tram and bus companies, urging them to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, it has apparently not been effective. The practice of ticket collectors skimming profits prevails as before, which is clear evidence of this. Therefore, after the citizens heard the news that the gas company was implementing a price reduction, they all hoped that other public utilities could also follow suit, vigorously increase revenue and reduce expenditure, so as to reduce the burden on the citizens and restore the so-called reputation of public utilities.

Officially Announced Next Thursday

It is also heard that although the gas company's price reduction proposal has been passed by the Public Utilities Committee, it still needs to be submitted to the Municipal Council meeting to be convened at 4:30 pm next Wednesday for approval. A public announcement regarding this matter is expected to be issued next Thursday. It is generally believed that the implementation of this case is without doubt.

Nanyang Coal Shipments to Shanghai Increase Daily

Due to the lack of coal transport ships in the city earlier, the arrival of goods was scarce, coal merchants hoarded goods, and market prices soared. The bituminous coal used by the Municipal Council factory and the raw materials of coal balls and coal dust used by households all skyrocketed. In the past month, as the situation in the Pacific has gradually become clearer, the quantity of coal from Hong Gai Coal in Vietnam, Borneo, India, Keelung, and other places shipped to Shanghai has been huge, and the inventory is sufficient, and market prices are trending downwards. The coal balls needed for daily use by citizens have also fallen from 17 yuan to 15.8 or 16 yuan. Yesterday, another 10,000 tons of bituminous coal arrived in the city.

Rumor Tangshan Coal Supplying Shanghai

The Shanghai Times reports that the Havas News Agency's Tianjin news published in a Japanese newspaper stated that the Shanghai Power Company has recently engaged in consultations with the Kailan Mining Bureau and Portuguese shipping companies, and several Portuguese ships will carry Tangshan coal from the Kailan Mining Bureau from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai for supply. Regarding this statement, neither the Shanghai Power Company nor the Kailan branch have confirmed it.

Power Authorities Hope for Realization

According to Mr. Hopkin, president of the Power Company, he told reporters that as far as he knew, the Power Company had agreed with the Kailan Mining Bureau since 1937 to transport 25,000 tons of coal per month from North China to Shanghai for supply, and there was no change. Mr. Wei, director of the Kailan branch in this city, also said that he did not know of any consultations to increase the number of coal shipments. An investigation revealed that the Shanghai Power Company's fuel supply is mainly based on Kailan coal. Although the parties concerned do not believe the news from the Havas News Agency, Hopkin hopes that this news is true. As for the issue of ships carrying coal to Shanghai, there is no major change either.

### Local Russian √âmigr√©s Enthusiastically Donate to the Moscow Red Cross

The Continental Daily reports that since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war three and a half weeks ago, the total amount of donations from Russian √©migr√©s in Shanghai to the Russian Red Cross Special Fund has reached about 40,000 yuan, of which 25,000 yuan was collected by the Russian-language newspaper and transferred to the Moscow National Bank, and 10,000 yuan was donated by members of the Soviet General Association. In addition to these two formal institutions collecting donations for the Red Cross, the Henry Road Russian-Chinese Credit Cooperative has also collected several thousand yuan in donations from Russian √©migr√©s. It is said that the Russian-Chinese Credit Cooperative was recently accused by the White Russian Immigration Committee of being a non-Russian institution because it collected donations for the comfort of the army.

### Japanese Taxpayers' Association Changes Name

The Japanese Taxpayers' Association held a meeting on the 12th to discuss the issue of reorganization.

The list is as follows: Hashimoto Gojiro, Mimura Masataka, Kann≈ç Ekisabur≈ç, Tsutsumi Takashi, Yasui Gengo, Sugimura Hirozo, Sakamoto Keiji, Watari Ichigoro.

### British Association in China Registers Women to Replace Men Serving in the Military

The North-China Daily News reports that the General Affairs Committee of the British Association in China announced at a meeting on the 15th of this month that it had established a special committee in accordance with the suggestion made by Ms. Mann at the members' meeting on June 27th to register British women overseas. Any British woman who is willing to work overseas or is prepared to replace the positions of British men so that men can serve in the military can go to register.

### Chinese Taxpayers' Association Suddenly Occupied Yesterday Morning

The Chinese Taxpayers' Association at No. 303, Bank Association Building, 54 Hong Kong Road, International Settlement, had been closed for business for a long time, and all the staff had left. Therefore, the association closed the office, and only the police were stationed there regularly. Yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m., De Shouqi suddenly arrived with two Japanese nationals. The police officers on duty stopped them. They telegraphed the police station, and the police sent personnel. After some consultation, the police officer stated that he would not interfere. De entered the address, collected various documents, and sent people to guard the premises.

### French Ambassador Cosme Leaves Shanghai for Tianjin This Morning, Will Transfer to Peiping to Handle Affairs, Will Return to Shanghai from Beidaihe After Autumn Cools

French Ambassador to China, Cosme, arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing this spring and has remained in Shanghai and Tianjin in North China, rarely interacting with the outside world except for handling embassy affairs. After Cosme recently arrived in Shanghai by plane from Peiping, Shanghai newspapers repeatedly reported that the ambassador would go to Beidaihe for summer vacation, but this was denied by the official authorized Havas News Agency. The reporter of the New Voice News Agency has learned from relevant parties that Cosme does indeed have a trip to the north. He is scheduled to fly directly to Tianjin from Datong by plane this morning. After a short stay in Tianjin, he will go to Peiping to handle official duties and then go to Beidaihe for summer vacation. He will return to Shanghai when the autumn cools. The air ticket has been booked early. The embassy in Shanghai telegraphed Peiping on the 17th to report the travel schedule.

### Guangdong Wheel Parts Unloaded Yesterday, Japanese Side Says Further Research Required, The Wheel Approved for Export on Monday

The Taikoo Company's Guangdong Wheel, which was carrying more than 200 boxes of machinery parts entrusted by Anli Foreign Company to Singapore, was exported at noon on the 10th of this month. It was detained by the Japanese Navy at the mouth of Wusong and berthed at the Donggou Junpu Bureau Wharf. It has been more than a week since the Japanese side delayed checking the machinery parts, delaying the voyage of the ship. It is said that the more than 200 boxes of machinery parts loaded on the ship began to be unloaded yesterday and piled up on the wharf. The Japanese side still needs to check it. The ship is scheduled to continue exporting next Monday and sail to Singapore and Yangon. However, Anli Foreign Company has long denied the so-called machinery parts being transported to Chongqing.

### Luo Yunyan Escorted to Nanjing

The North-China Daily News reports that, according to sources from the Christian community, Legislative Councilor Luo Yunyan has now been escorted to Jiangning.

### Summer Night Curfew Strictly Enforced in Border Areas

Recently, the police departments of the two concessions, in view of the arrival of hot weather, may be lax about the night curfew. In order to prevent unscrupulous elements from infiltrating and ensure the security of the concession, they have strictly strengthened the curfew and dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western armed detectives to check pedestrians and vehicles entering and leaving at the border, such as the intersection of Haig Road and Shantou Road, the intersection of Foch Road and Great West Road, and the traffic arteries of Jing'an Temple Road, Yu Ge Road, and Jessfield Road. All passengers in passing vehicles must get out of the car and be searched one by one, and packages and objects are also strictly inspected to prevent carrying weapons. In addition, the number of pedestrians detained for violating the curfew has also increased in recent days.

### Customs Anti-Smuggling Hopes for Cooperation

According to news from the Jianghai Customs yesterday, although the Customs feels difficulties in anti-smuggling due to environmental pressure, it still tries to order all tax police to pay attention to the cargo transportation of merchants. All merchants who transport domestic and foreign goods in and out must report to the Customs for inspection, and can only be shipped after inspection. Whether the domestic goods are transported from the production area to Shanghai by water, land or air, and are intended to be transshipped to other ports from Shanghai, they must also pay the transit tax to the designated office of the Customs or to the temporary checkpoint before they can be transshipped to other ports, otherwise they will be regarded as smuggling private goods and will be severely punished in accordance with the established regulations. However, in addition to repeatedly ordering the tax police under its jurisdiction to work hard to combat smuggling, the Customs also hopes that merchants and people will give their full cooperation to jointly eliminate the evil habit of smuggling, thereby increasing national tax revenue.

### Principal and Interest of Five Kinds of Unified Bonds Due Paid in Full

In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers' four banks to discount and pay the eleventh principal and interest due on the unified public bonds of the Republic of China in the twenty-fifth year, Class A, B, C, D, and E. The Central Bank and the China and Communications Banks entrusted by it throughout the country are designated to pay the money. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has been ordered to handle the payment from the 31st of this month, and has rushed to handle the payment procedures. It is hoped that bondholders will go to collect it at that time. Domestic debts guaranteed by the current customs surplus can be paid in full, which is deeply supported by bondholders.

### British Court in China First Hears Lease Case

Yesterday, the British Court in China in this city heard the first case of a foreign lease dispute. It is understood that the plaintiff's lawyer is also the participant in the same case, so it has aroused interest from all parties. The reason for the lawsuit is that the defendant wanted to sublet the disputed house to a third party, which was not satisfied by the plaintiff, so he filed a lawsuit with the court for an injunction. The case was heard by Judge Moser. The plaintiff's lawyer, Jones, requested the court to prohibit the defendant from subletting the disputed house and to order the payment of four months' rent, totaling 1,340 yuan. It is said that although the defendant has not sublet the house now, the defendant is about to leave Shanghai, and this kind of behavior is likely to occur. However, according to the contract between the two parties, subletting is prohibited. Judge Moser ruled that the defendant did not appear in court and should be prohibited from disposing of the disputed house in any way before the end of the litigation.

### Post Office Recruits Letter Carriers, More Than 500 People Admitted

The Shanghai Postal Administration publicly recruited letter carriers, and the written examination was rescheduled to be held on the 8th of last month, and was held on a regular basis. However, the number of people admitted was previously rumored to be between 150 and 200. According to a reporter from Dalian News Agency, the Shanghai Post Office has never announced the number of employees recruited at all levels in the past. Those who pass the examination will be admitted and appointed to fill vacancies. Therefore, there were more than 540 people admitted on the list released on the previous (13th) day.

### Appeal from Shanghai Charity Organizations

Since the sudden changes in the situation, the French Concession Charity Organization has been planning for several years by local philanthropists, and it has felt stretched and extremely difficult. Since this year, it has been even more painful. Because the Charity Organization has long had the reputation of having property, and donations have never been solicited, various charitable donations are often rejected. However, it is not known that the property of the organization, such as the central part of the city, has been largely destroyed by war, with only half of the building remaining. If it is left alone, it will be dismantled by petty thieves; if it is repaired, the cost will be huge. If one or two are selected for repair, there are very few reliable tenants. The previously large income has been transformed into expenses. Even in the concession area, the rent has always been low, and the landlord is responsible for water and electricity. Now that water and electricity have soared, there is little profit after deducting expenses. If the intention is to increase, it is often said that charitable organizations should not be compared with operators, half asking for help and half smiling sarcastically. After many persuasion, only a few have increased. In addition, the land rent has been scarce for several years, so let's leave it alone. Last year, the income was more abundant, and the land rent was naturally larger. However, local agencies collect donations and taxes, and local tycoons collect fees. After deducting here and there, the remaining rent is almost insufficient to cover the local expenses. In addition, various stocks, etc., have stopped paying interest since the war. As for the subsidy from the Municipal Council, after repeated negotiations, the increase is very small. In short, even though philanthropists from all sides occasionally give alms every month, it is just a drop in the bucket. This is the general situation of income.

As for the current expenditure, all the good deeds such as the Vagrant Training Center, the Qingjie Hall, the Nursery, the Vocational Training Center, and the schools are given a certain amount to each person every month due to practical difficulties to make a slight change in relief. Medicine is given, and it is still continuing. All of this can be done by trying to make do with the surplus and deficit. However, the most difficult thing is the coffin burial of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall and the food supply of the nursing home. The price of boards has been increasing monthly. What used to be four or five yuan per coffin is now more than fifty yuan. What used to be three or four hundred coffins per month is now more than six hundred coffins. The cost of boards alone requires more than 30,000 yuan per month. The other ancillary expenses will naturally increase with it. Since the price of rice has risen repeatedly, the food supply of the nursing home has also become a major problem, as well as the rice subsidies and salaries of the staff and workers, which are all affected, and there is no month without a slight increase, and there is no month without problems. This is the general situation of expenditure.

The income is like that, and the expenditure is like this. Now, like pulling vines to repair the roof, the excavation has been exhausted. The accounts of the lumber store for the Dragon Boat Festival have not been settled yet. Before the war, there were already many debts for construction projects. If we move and take again, there is no pledge, and the budget is just a formality, and the aftermath is difficult to predict. If the price of boards rises again and epidemics prevail, it will affect both the social appearance, residents, and hygiene. Those who die on the road cannot be ignored for a day, and the elderly cannot be unsupported for a day. There is no way to turn stone into gold, and it is difficult to cook without rice. We must ask local philanthropists to generously donate money and jointly provide relief.

### Director-General of the Japanese Ministry of Finance, Kiuchi, Rushes Back to China

Kiuchi Shiro, former Finance Officer of the Ministry of Finance stationed in China, was transferred to the Director-General of the Ministry of Finance. He was originally scheduled to return to China on the Kobe Maru on the 24th. However, due to the change of the Japanese cabinet and changes in the political situation, he decided to move forward to return to China by plane on the morning of the 19th to take office.

The Clifford President, which left San Francisco on the 3rd of this month, also carries 400,000 pounds of crushed wheat. It is learned that the churches in Ningbo and Shaoxing have sent telegrams to the Shanghai Red Cross, requesting that as much relief wheat as possible be shipped to these two places because of the serious famine in these areas. It is said that the Japanese side has agreed to have Japanese ships carry it. It is also learned that the American Red Cross headquarters in Washington has sent Mr. Meyer to China to assist Mr. Wesley, the chief executive of the Red Cross in China. Meyer will manage the distribution of medicines, food, and clothing. These items are all transported to the interior of China via the Yunnan-Burma Road. Meyer has served the Red Cross for 23 years. He engaged in relief work in the war zone during the European War, and also worked in Siberia. His footprints have spread almost all over the United States, and he has extremely rich experience in deploying relief projects.

Now the ship has left Chengshan carrying the original goods and continued to Tianjin, and will arrive at its destination soon.

### Democratic Radio Holds a Moonlit Drama Performance: A Short News Play Sponsored by the British Information Office

### Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund: Registration Begins Next Week; Monks Contribute Alms for Scholarship: Yesterday's Receipts Exceeded Previous Days

Yesterday was the seventh day of fundraising for the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund. Donations from all quarters have been increasingly enthusiastic. From dawn till dusk, over eight hundred yuan were collected. Many readers have expressed their willingness to donate goods to the newspaper for a charity sale, which is deeply appreciated. However, due to the complexity of charity sale procedures, we regret that we cannot proceed with it. We kindly request that donations be converted into cash for convenience. The application forms and registration forms that were drafted previously will be printed shortly, and we anticipate that applications and registration can begin within the next week.

Yesterday's Donation Record

Yesterday's donors included Mr. Bian Zongyuan, two hundred yuan; Mr. Ma Zhigang, two hundred yuan; Mr. Feng Zhengxiang, two hundred yuan; Mr. Zheng Liangbin, two hundred yuan; Mr. Shi Naixiu, twenty yuan; Ying She, fifteen yuan; Mr. Gu Qiying's fundraising from four people, four yuan; Monk Guangjue, three yuan; Mr. Cheng Yaoting, two yuan; Mr. Jiang Guang, one yuan and twenty-five cents. The above totaled eight hundred forty-six yuan and twenty-five cents. The total to date is four thousand three hundred twenty-three yuan and seventy-two cents.

Even Outsiders Do Not Stand Idly By

Monk Guangjue of the Yuanming Lecture Hall on the Great Western Road was deeply moved by the scholarship fund launched by this newspaper. He sent three yuan via mail yesterday, stating in the letter that compassion is inherent in all humanity and is a factor in promoting society. Although monks renounce the world to study Buddhism, how can Buddhist teachings be separated from worldly affairs? Moreover, compassion is the gateway to enlightenment, and charity is the foremost of the six perfections. To break free from delusion and greed, one must focus on it. The academic aspirations of Ni, Bao, and Wu are strong, but they are hindered by circumstances. Their situation is pitiful, and their ambition is commendable. I am ashamed that I cannot provide substantial assistance. I humbly offer three yuan from my alms. The amount is small, and I feel ashamed, but accumulating like ants carrying burdens is each doing their best.

A Reader's Benevolent Act of Donating Found Money is Commendable

Reader Mr. Jiang Guang found one yuan and twenty-five cents in legal tender at the corner of the Jin Cheng Grand Theatre the night before last. After waiting for a long time with no one claiming it, he immediately sent it yesterday as a donation. Mr. Jiang's honesty in returning found money is truly commendable.

Philanthropic Scholarships are a National Duty

Mr. Ma Zhigang wrote, "Your newspaper's initiation of a readers' scholarship fund benefits disaster victims and brings blessings to humanity. I deeply agree with this righteous act. I offer a check for two hundred yuan as a small contribution to fulfill my national duty." Also, Mr. Bian Zongyuan of Chang Ji Trading Company wrote, "Our family tutor taught classes in the disaster children's education center and mentioned Ni's academic progress. Please consider providing assistance. At the time, I promised to help with his book and stationery expenses. Now that I know your newspaper has a comprehensive plan to help with his food, lodging, and other expenses for three years, I have already promised to help with his book expenses, which are estimated to be about one hundred yuan for the entire junior high school. I am donating an additional one hundred yuan to the scholarship fund." The enthusiasm of Mr. Ma and Mr. Bian is deeply admired by our colleagues.

Enthusiastic Readers Express Their Opinions

Mr. Sun Yinbin of Muir Road generously donates fifty yuan per semester and wrote to express his views: "... I deeply admire the rigorous organization and grand scale of your newspaper's scholarship fund. In my opinion, this matter should be sustained. Relying solely on temporary donations may lead to interruptions, as was seen in refugee relief efforts. However, refugees can be dispersed at any time, but the education of disaster victims cannot be abandoned halfway. At that time, advancing or retreating will be difficult, and one will feel the pain of building a mountain but failing to complete it. Therefore, in addition to temporary donations, it is more appropriate to solicit permanent donations, such as recognizing several disaster-stricken children each semester. There is no shortage of enthusiastic philanthropists in Shanghai, and they can devise proper methods." In addition, Ying She and young Gu Qiying also have good ideas, but due to length constraints, they are not recorded.

### Female Leg Discovered in the Suzhou Creek

The Water Police Department is currently investigating a bizarre case of a dismembered female thigh. The case occurred at 6:00 AM yesterday. A sampan of the Water Police Department was patrolling near the Tianhou Temple Bridge on the Suzhou Creek when they discovered a section of a snow-white human leg floating in the water. It was immediately retrieved and taken for inspection. The leg had been severed at the knee, and the toes were intact. Based on the skin and flesh, it was determined to be the leg of a young woman and must have been severed not long ago, as the leg showed no signs of decay or swelling. However, why it was severed and where the woman's body is remain under investigation by the police. General observations suggest that the case likely involves a romantic entanglement.

### Dance Hall Manager Assaults a Patron

A major fight occurred at the Cosmopolitan Dance Hall, 577 Jing'an Temple Road, at approximately 8:00 PM on the 12th of this month.

### Police Dog Bites a Rural Woman to Death

### Report on the General Education Conditions by the Director of Education of Guangdong: Emphasizing Both the Examination of Teachers' Qualifications and Increased Funding; National Education Can Be Implemented in the New System Counties

(Shaoguan Airmail Report) The Guangdong Provincial Provisional Assembly held its fifth general meeting at 9:00 AM on July 8th. The report on the general education conditions was given by Huang Linshu, Director of Education, and Secretary Chen Jiaqi reported on behalf of him. Director Huang himself answered when questions were asked. Secretary Chen's report mainly focused on the promotion of national education. In terms of schools, it was stipulated that starting from January of last year and this year, the 27 counties such as Qujiang, which began implementing the new county system, should increase the number of township national schools without central schools by at least 40% of the number of counties. The 12 counties such as Jieyang and Xinyi, which began implementing the new system in July of this year, must set up all the townships and towns without central schools within this year, ensuring that the national schools should reach at least 30% of the number of counties. Regarding the counties behind the front and not implementing the new county system, such as the 30 counties and bureaus such as Lingshan, at least half of the townships and towns should have central schools within this year, and the national schools that should be set up should reach at least 20% of the number of counties. Regarding the implementation situation since May, the counties have obeyed the order to establish 1,551 township (town) central schools and 7,035 national schools. Among them, those who have handled it quickly and can set up sufficient central schools according to the original plan include 34 counties such as Qujiang. Those who can establish national schools according to the plan include 21 county bureaus such as Meixian and Xingning. According to statistics on the number of schools, since the implementation of national education, as of May, there are a total of 1,581 central schools, which is still 900 schools short, and a total of 7,055 national schools have been established, which is still 4,000 schools short. It is believed that the plan to set up schools this year can be completed by continuing to prepare for the establishment at the beginning of the next semester. In terms of teachers, as of April of this year, 11,861 qualified teachers and 1,158 substitute teachers were examined and qualified. The unqualified teachers will continue to be examined and identified in all counties of the province from June 15th to August 15th. Secondly, one-year simple normal schools will be set up separately in the counties, and the quality and quantity of normal subjects for high school students will be increased, emphasizing both. In terms of funding, the national education funding for this year is a total of 1.3 million yuan, an increase of more than 570,000 yuan compared with last year. The new system counties have paid great attention to the implementation of national education, which is a good phenomenon. The more important thing is to promote the self-raising of funds in various townships (towns), making it a trend. Secondly, regarding the general situation of secondary schools, a total of 305 schools have been reported for record, which has restored the number of schools that withdrew from Guangzhou. Regarding the lack of books and instruments, the Education Department has been actively trying to find a solution. After the report was completed, Senator Zhang Guangdi asked: 1. What are the disposal methods for counties that do not implement education orders? 2. Have surveys been conducted on school-age children in various places who are out of school? 3. What measures are taken for normal school graduates who are unwilling to serve? Senator Chen Zhiqian asked a total of nine questions about the problems of primary and secondary school teachers, which were answered separately by Director Huang and then dismissed.

### Jinan University Plans to Establish a Branch School in Fujian; Shanghai School Continues as Usual

Yesterday's newspaper reported that Yong'an telegram stated that National Jinan University was about to move inland.

After receiving the order, the school immediately telegraphed the Fujian Education Department for assistance and has sent personnel on their way to prepare everything a few days ago. The Shanghai school is still proceeding as usual and there is no talk of moving inland.

### Shanghai Student Relief Association: Summer Relief Work; Allocates Huge Sum of Money to Open Student Cafeteria

The Shanghai Student Relief Committee, organized by the Shanghai YMCA and YWCA, in addition to operating student relief funds and a student economic dormitory, also plans various new undertakings this year, which have been well received by people from all walks of life. According to Lin Yonghou, a staff member of the YMCA Student Department, the following is a detailed report to the Dahua News Agency regarding the recent summer relief work conducted by the association:

Summer Social Service Work

Hundreds of students have already applied to participate in this work. The association will select 100 people to engage in work after strict review. Because this type of work contains the meaning of social understanding and self-help education, those who participate in the work will be given corresponding rewards depending on their work performance. Social service work is roughly divided into three types: (1) Social life survey. The survey of beggar children's lives is temporarily set, and experts from Shanghai are invited to guide it. (2) Lane children's education work. Participants will be trained for a considerable period of time before engaging in work. (3) Church youth work. Encourage church youth to pay attention to and participate in various activities in the church.

Student Cafeteria Under Active Preparation

In view of the seriousness of the student food problem in Shanghai, the association has specially requested the National General Association to allocate a huge sum of money to open a student cafeteria in order to solve the food problem for general students under the three principles of nutrition, hygiene and economy. It is learned that the association has invited Yang Huaiseng and others to form a committee to actively arrange the interior so as to meet the needs of the students when the schools open in the next semester, and will investigate some extremely poor students and give them certificates to enjoy special discounts when they go to eat in the cafeteria.

Relief Application for the Next Semester

The application date for student relief funds for the next semester will begin in mid-August. Applicants are requested to complete the procedures for the school transcript and the school's introduction letter as soon as possible. The amount of relief money has increased slightly, with high school students receiving 70 yuan per person and university students receiving 100 yuan per person.

### Suzhou Art College Holds a Student Exhibition

Suzhou Art College is hosted by the famous painter Yan Wenshou. The school has a well-established reputation, and the students' achievements are quite remarkable. Since the fall of Suzhou, it has rented a school building on the seventh floor of the Enterprise Building on Sichuan Road in Shanghai and has continued to operate for more than three years. Usually, there are many insights between teachers and students in their studies, and the past art exhibitions have been well received. It is learned that a student exhibition will be held at the original site of the school for five days from the 20th to the 24th of this month. The achievements of the students in recent years will be brought together. It is expected that there will be a number of good works for evaluation by all sectors of society.

Academic Lecture

### The Research Methods of History (5) Lan Wu Jing

A. Discovery of Ape-Men. In 1918, the Swedish man Anderson went to Zhoukoudian, Beijing, to investigate. In 1921, Shidanski helped Anderson to excavate. In 1923, a piece of jawbone was discovered. In 1926, two human teeth were found, one upper molar and one lower premolar. In 1929, an ape-man bone was found. Pei Wenzhong estimated it to be a female skull. At that time, Dr. Glib named it "Peking Man". Later, after comparative research by Dr. Butasz, it was identified as "Chinese Ape-Man of the Peking species", confirming it as a human being between modern humans and "apes". As for the era of its existence, it was in the Old Ice Age. Anderson believed that it was earlier than the previously discovered humans, Erect Ape-Man, Heidelberg Man, and Dawson Man in the world. They lived in caves and knew how to use fire, stone tools, and bone horns. They are the ancestors of the Chinese people. The throne of Pangu should be given to him. According to experts, it was about 400,000 to 500,000 years ago, or about one million years ago. Before other humans were discovered, it could also be said to be the ancestors of humans in the world. The old saying that the origin of the Chinese nation came from the East is self-defeating.

B. Determination of the Stone Age. Human evolution has progressed from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age, and then to the Iron Age. This statement is not accepted by those who entrusted the ancients to reform the system. However, facts speak louder than words. The determination of the Stone Age in China is also a major discovery by archaeologists. The Old and New Stone Ages are described below.

(A) Discovery of the Old Stone Age

In the summer of 1925, the American Central Asia Expedition, under the guidance of Nelson, discovered rock fragments in Aro Nor, Mongolia, that were similar to humans. In the autumn of 1923, Fader Rizhen and Gong Sang Yizhihua discovered stone tools in Youfangtou, Yulin County, Shaanxi, mostly made of coal. In Ningsha County, Ningxia, there were hundreds of stone tools in the Donggou south of Ningsha County. The Sarawusu Gully in southeastern Ordos discovered extremely rich broken bones and a tooth, which can be regarded as the first discovery of Old Stone Age human bones in Asia.

Other stone tools have been discovered in the Gobi Desert and Zhoukoudian. The period they experienced was about 20,000 to 30,000 years, before the beginning of the New Stone Age.

(B) Discovery of the New Stone Age

In the summer of 1921, Anderson unearthed relics in Shaguotun, Jinxi County, Liaoning: (1) stone tools, (2) pottery, (3) miscellaneous tools, (4) bones. In the winter of the previous year, he obtained stone axes, knives, stone pestles, stone arrowheads, etc. in Yangshao Village, Mianchi County, western Henan. In 1923 and 1924, relics from the Neolithic and Bronze Ages were discovered in various parts of Gansu, divided into six periods. Using the names of the places where they were obtained, they were called the "Qijia Period", the "Yangshao Period" (or thought to be the Xia Dynasty or the Xia clan era), the "Machang Period", the "Xindian Period", the "Siwa Period", and the "Shajing Period". The first three periods were the Neolithic period, and the last three periods were the early Bronze Age. Each period averaged about 300 years. Gansu culture may have originated around 3500 BC and ended around 1700 BC.

Other Neolithic relics have been discovered in Xiyin Village in Xia County, Shanxi, Chengzhiya in Longshan Town, Jinan, Shandong, the Liaodong Peninsula, Rehe, Heilongjiang, Ang'angxi, and Hong Kong.

### Accepting the Gifts of Civilization

‚Äî Guo Hongdi

Who in the world does not cherish their own life?

In order to save lives, scientists and medical professionals have spent countless efforts, time, and energy in laboratories, consuming much energy and life. Their sacrifices are great, but their efforts are not in vain.

Since Pasteur invented vaccination, and the medical community subsequently invented vaccinations, countless precious lives have been saved. This is a true gift of human civilization! These gifts, conveniences, and safeguards are given to us freely. The crowd is the target of scientists' efforts. As long as humans can receive these gifts, they will be satisfied, and they will not ask us for any price in return.

However, the world is truly full of wonders. White-coated people serving the public give free vaccinations on the road, yet many people detour and flee, avoiding them as if they were plagues. Hospitals are everywhere, and doctors are everywhere, but they refuse to get vaccinated. They are afraid of pain, they are afraid of mild fever, they are afraid of arm soreness and swelling, and they think that vaccinations are superfluous. They are unwilling to accept the gifts of the great servants of humanity.

If Pasteur knew this in the afterlife, I wonder what he would think?

Even if not for ourselves, then for the sake of public health, and to be a good example for other less knowledgeable members of society, we should all actively endure that momentary slight pain and accept this gift of civilization.

### I Love Beipei

‚Äî Feile

Our group is mobile, so we have traveled all over Sichuan, but we spend most of our time in Beipei.

Beipei, I just love this place. It's like Jiangwan in Shanghai, plain but charming and forthright! People who are used to living in Chongqing will feel an intangible sense of joy when they stay here for a while!

The current Beipei is no longer a concentration of doctors. Instead, the masters of the house are students full of vigor! From the Shandong natives who say "an zan" to the Guangdong girls who say "mou dong de", they are all digging into their future in books! Their spirit of hard work is enough to shame a group of people who hold foreign books as decorations?

Speaking of "foreign books," it is a very unfamiliar name in the inland. Textbooks above the high school level are all made of local paper lecture notes. Not only is it local paper, but the ink is also made of local smoke. It is already quite impressive to have a few broken dictionaries standing on the bookshelf. The standard of living is no lower than that of Chongqing; rice is 400 yuan per stone, meat is three yuan per catty, and eggs have also risen to three cents apiece. Therefore, money cannot be spent casually, be careful your stomach will be growling!

It is indeed quite bitter, but no one can be found to "complain" about the bitterness. "Bitterness" has created a strong and unyielding will, so "bitterness" does not need to be a sigh in the mouth!

A new friend from the north told me!

"The eyebrows of Tianjin people are in the shape of an 'eight', the eyebrows of Shanghai people are in the shape of a 'one', but the eyebrows of Chongqing people are in the shape of an 'O'."

Her meaning: what is seen in Tianjin is a crying face, Shanghai is a sad face, but Chongqing is a smiling face - not only a smiling face, but also a face full of energy!

Indeed, not only Chongqing, Beipei, but the entire inland shows cheerfulness! Determination! Proactiveness!

"Don't let yourself go"! It is not a slogan, it is not an IOU, it is action!

My work is so busy that it is okay, but it is generally happy! It feels at least a bit honorable to treat the glorious warriors. When they tell some stories about the front line, it makes our hearts active.

One thing is peculiar, so peculiar that the American doctors with us give us a thumbs up!

That is, not a single wounded soldier is "decadent". Their evaluation of the other side is invariably inseparable from the three words "not worth mentioning"!

If you ask me about the two words "grasp", I think this "not worth mentioning" is enough to symbolize it, right? In short, with the progress of time and space, belief has become a tightly clenched old fist.

We are waiting to see the power exerted by this old fist!

### Musicians of Nature

‚Äî Jiang Shui

The parks are full of flowers and green grass. Undoubtedly, we know: "It's time for the birds to sing again." But here, I want to ask you readers to pay attention. The musicians of nature are not just these birds: in addition, there are insects, frogs, toads, and the like, who are also famous "Beethovens" and "Mozarts" in nature.

Among insects, the most famous musician is the cicada. They have a very strange sound-producing organ. What's even stranger is that only male cicadas have this organ, while female cicadas do not. So many people say: "This is because the cicada brother sings too well, so he is given a mute wife, otherwise, wouldn't he be even more envied by people?" Poor thing, the belly of the female cicada is only a little sharper than that of the male cicada, and she can only be "mute". As for their children‚Äîlarvae‚Äîthey live in very deep basements, using tree roots as food. Their children are different from other people's children in that they have to live in an underground vault for a long time. In the United States, there is a type of cicada that must be 17 years old before it is allowed to go out. The sound-producing organ of the male cicada is a pair of drum-like membranes located under the abdomen. Due to the vibration of powerful muscles, when the membrane is stimulated, the sound is emitted. It is said that their motivation for singing is to attract partners of the opposite sex.

There is another type of insect musician - the grasshopper. They specialize in holding concerts in the evening. The ladies and misses put on bright green clothes, which are shining with white pear-like spots. When matched with beautiful pink edges, they are really tempting.

Finally, there is a type of frog. According to people who are familiar with them, "their singing is purely for fun, so they still like to sing in June and July." Inside the mouth of the frog, there is a pair of air sacs. When breathing, air is forced in from the nostrils, so the reverberation is particularly large. If dozens or hundreds of frogs sing a grand ensemble, their voices will be heard even a mile away. These scales are not only their instruments, but also the bedrooms for their children‚Äîtadpoles. The musicians of nature are really more than just these few, please discover them at any time.

### New Method for Quitting Alcohol (Revised)

Two doctors in New York have invented a scientific method for quitting alcohol, which is said to be very effective and worth introducing. The two doctors inject an emetic drug into the bodies of alcoholics, and then ask them to sit in a luxuriously decorated bar. After the drug takes effect, the doctors ask them to drink as much as possible, cup after cup, until the drug stops working. This method was implemented for a week, and as a result, those alcoholics no longer needed to be injected with drugs, and they wanted to vomit when they saw wine bottles, thus giving up the habit of harming their minds and wasting money.

### Gas Mask for Mothers and Children

‚Äî Shen Gang

In recent years, someone invented a gas mask that can be used by both mother and child. The baby is placed in an airtight oval bag, and the mother wears the gas mask. Because the breathing equipment is arranged very cleverly, the mother inhales air into the air chamber, which is not only enough for her own use, but also for her child. Because the baby's breathing is usually very weak, it cannot move the piston to inhale fresh air into the lungs. Therefore, this new type of gas mask is really beneficial to the "future masters".

11. Midnight Song

For dozens of days, because she often came and went to the Wu family, Meng's daughter-in-law had also gained some understanding of Qiu Haitang's strange habit of not being willing to spend an extra penny for himself.

"I know this." She nodded with a smile. "In fact, why does the old man have to think so hard about money?"

As she grew older day by day, Mei Bao gradually understood her father's economic situation. The kind of idea she had before, thinking that her father's hard work and frugality was purely a fool, was no longer in her mind.

"Sister-in-law, you have a shop and do business, and the money can come back after it goes out; our family's situation is different." Mei Bao lowered her head and dusted off some of the dust that had just stained her blue cloth short coat with her fingers. "Only two or three months out of the year can we sell some wheat straw and beans, and receive very little money. For the remaining ten months, we simply send out silver dollars and banknotes. Do you think that can keep my father from worrying?"

This immediately suited Meng's daughter-in-law's taste; today, she had nothing to do at home and was feeling bored. In particular, that mouth that liked to talk the most was more uncomfortable than death when asked to keep it shut; now, Mei Bao's mention of family affairs immediately aroused her interest.

"In principle, our two families are close neighbors with doors facing each other, so we should be more affectionate than other families; but it's funny to say, our masters and my father-in-law are busy doing business all day long, so they have never been close to your father, and everyone seems very estranged..." Her fluent and clear voice sounded like the most annoying firefly in Mei Bao's ears. "It's rare that you don't treat me as an outsider, and you tell me everything, so I'll ask you impolitely. After all, how much land does your family have? Does your father have any business outside? In recent years, has the harvest from the fields been able to cover the family's expenses? Also, do you have any relatives elsewhere besides this Zhangshu Village?" (162)

### Diana Durbin Talks About Married Life

‚Äî Qinghui

Worth Reading for Those Who Want to Enjoy Family Happiness

Eighteen-year-old Diana Durbin is now a married woman. Her marriage with Vaughan Paul was unanimously praised by fans as a "match made in heaven," wishing them a long and happy life together. Therefore, everyone is eager to know what her married life is like? Now, after being a bride for two months, she frankly spoke to all walks of life.

Couple Portrait. Above the piano in Durbin's sitting room hangs a colorful double photo. She is wearing a plain white shirt with a white ribbon on her brown hair. Vaughan is wearing a white shirt with black stripes and holds Durbin to his chest, proudly showing the posture of a husband. "This photo was taken a week before our wedding," she said, pointing to the photo.

Flowers. "He is not only a perfect husband," she said proudly, "but also a thoughtful lover. He never forgets my work schedule, our appointments, or the day we first met. He never forgets to send me flowers when it is time to send them. If I feel unwell, or he is busy with work and cannot accompany me on outings, he always chooses some high-quality flowers to comfort me."

Temperament. "He also pays great attention to appearance, even the smallest details are not neglected. He always stands up every time I enter the room, even if there are only two of us in the room. However, he sometimes gets annoyed for no reason. When this happens, I just leave him alone and don't pay attention to him. He will pace back and forth, even for half a day. If it's too long, I will stop him, and he will stop immediately. He also gets angry, but only for bigger things that would make anyone angry. He is not an impatient person and will never lose his temper over trivial matters. In fact, he rarely gets angry.

Considerate. "There is one thing that makes him unhappy, and that is when I make him wait for me to slowly dress up for a banquet. He feels that it is unreasonable for women to make men wait for them to put on makeup. He says that it is of course their right for women to spend a lot of time making themselves beautiful, and no one can interfere, but they should pay attention to the time and prepare in advance. They shouldn't make people wait temporarily.

Household Affairs. "He must have absolute control over everything in the house, and a family should of course be like this. He really takes over my housework, and he is in complete charge of hiring or firing servants. When we hold a banquet at home, he arranges the food and wine and discusses the program with me. He also manages the household accounts. He likes to organize everything in an orderly manner.

Recreation. "He doesn't easily make friends, but if you make friends with him, he will be your lifelong friend, even if you commit a serious crime, he will not break off with you. Although he himself doesn't like to go to amusement places late at night, he knows that I sometimes like to go out and have fun, so he accompanies me and tries his best to make me have a happy and enjoyable time.

Service. "Of course, he doesn't object to my work. Because there are few household affairs, he also feels that it is better for me to have work outside than to be idle at home. But when we have children, he will no longer allow me to work outside. He clearly explained that at that time I should belong completely to the family and fulfill the responsibilities of a housewife.

From her words, it can be seen how much they love each other. They share the joy of leisure time and live an interesting and happy life. There are no quarrels, only that bright and enviable happiness. Indeed, they are truly a match made in heaven.

His acting skills are of a great school, and Cao Cao's plays are unique in today's opera world; the role of Lu Zhishen is especially known as a "unique skill". Although his body is slightly fat, it is not enough to be a defect in a wise man.

He once took the lead in Pingzi and formed a troupe to perform. In recent years, he has intended to retire.

Spring and Autumn in the Silver Screen

### Gold Star Withdraws from Datong, Joins Mei Cheng Collaboration; Guohua Courts Minhua, Seeks Jincheng Films

‚Äî Bashi

In the post-war film scene, apart from the joke of the double production case last year when everyone rushed to film folk stories, everyone has traditionally adopted a Monroe Doctrine, with no major storms. However, in the past week, several film industry giants have been engaging in mutual disputes using political means. The companies involved include Gold Star, Guohua, Minhua, Datong, and Mei Cheng. The figures involved include Zhou Jianyun, Liu Zhonghao, Yan Heming, and Jin Xinmin, among others. The inner workings are complex, truly a chapter worth recording in the annals of the silver screen!

Here, the reporter stands on an objective position to report the news:

First, when Gold Star Company was founded, it rented the studio from Datong. However, Datong's studio was built with funds from Liu Zhonghao, the owner of Guohua Company. Therefore, after the lease contract between Gold Star and Datong expired on June 15th, Liu Zhonghao stated that he would take it back for his own use and would not rent it to Gold Star for filming anymore. Zhou Jianyun, the person in charge of Gold Star, although having close ties with Datong, could do nothing and expressed acceptance, rushing to film "Gunfire in the Rainy Night" while looking for a new studio.

Coincidentally, at this time, internal disputes occurred within Gold Star, with six shareholders, including Zeng Wanpu, announcing their withdrawal. Naturally, this was a serious problem. Therefore, Liu Zhonghao discussed with Zhou Jianyun, willing to buy Zeng's shares, but demanding more than half, so that Gold Star could also be under Liu Zhonghao's control, and the problem of continuing to film at Datong could of course be solved. However, Zhou Jianyun refused.

Thus, the new shareholder of Gold Star was completely taken by Sheng Buhua. Sheng is a major businessman in Shanghai, and his influence immediately became vast. The problem of the studio was then negotiated with Yan Heming of Mei Cheng. After several negotiations, all problems were resolved. Gold Star joined Mei Cheng in cooperation from August 1st. However, Gold Star was forced to do so, but because Gold Star urgently needed to solve the studio problem, it had to accept.

After Gold Star withdrew from Datong Studio, friction arose between it and Guohua. Naturally, future productions would no longer be screened at Jincheng. Moreover, Sheng Buhua is also a major shareholder of Xinhua Grand Theater. There is no doubt that Gold Star's films will be obtained by Xinhua. Therefore, even if Liu Zhonghao's Guohua produces more films, they cannot be screened consecutively at both Jincheng and Jindu theaters. Thus, he visited Jin Xinmin, the owner of Minhua, hoping that Jin Xinmin would, from Minhua's position, refuse Gold Star's joining in August (Minhua often cooperates with Mei Cheng). However, Jin Xinmin felt that Minhua had very few actors and actresses, and delaying filming for two months was not a big deal, while Gold Star was different, so he did not agree. After Liu Zhonghao's first plan failed, he discussed cooperation with Jin Xinmin again. His purpose was nothing more than to ensure that if Jincheng and Jindu face a film shortage in the future, they could cooperate with Minhua, so that Minhua's productions could be screened at Jincheng and Jindu. Jin Xinmin is still considering whether Liu Zhonghao's second strategy will succeed.

Looking at the above situation, the atmosphere of strife is indeed very strong. Future developments remain to be proven by facts.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

‚Äî Gu Mingdao

Chapter Twelve: Ultimately, Ning Wu Can Do Nothing

Zhou Yuji knew he could not hold the city, looked up to the sky and sighed, and led two or three hundred of his trusted soldiers, along with Zhang Lie, down the city to meet the rebel soldiers and engage in street fighting with them. The bandit general Zuo Jinhu rode his horse to kill, wanting to capture Zhou Yuji to establish a great merit. Zhou Yuji wielded the gilded spear in his hand urgently. How could Zuo Jinyu be his opponent? In less than twenty rounds, Zhou Yuji stabbed him in the shoulder with one spear, knocking him off his saddle, and the rebel soldiers rescued him. When the bandit general Shetian rushed up, Zhou Yuji roared with angry eyes, his eyes almost bursting. Shetian dared not engage in battle and turned his horse to flee. When Zhou Yuji chased after him, he drew out the iron whip from his waist and struck him on the back, hitting Shetian so hard that he vomited blood and leaned on his saddle to flee. At this time, Li Chuang was riding his horse into the city, and when he heard that Zhou Yuji was still fighting like a trapped beast, he ordered his eight battle generals to fight together, determined to capture Zhou Yuji alive and reduce his family. Therefore, although Zhou Yuji killed dozens or hundreds of people, the bandits became more numerous the more they were killed, and surrounded him on all sides. He knew that there was no hope of survival, and he was willing to sacrifice himself to achieve righteousness, leaving righteousness in the world, only seeking to kill more bandits and obtain a significant price. Zhang Lie also followed his master, fighting desperately. The two of them killed crazily, blood flowing over their robes and armor, and they were both wounded in several places, and their subordinate soldiers were almost completely dead. The bandits were somewhat frightened by the ferocity of the two. One bandit general, confident in his bravery, raised his great axe and came to fight Yuji. Zhou Yuji used all his strength in both arms, and with a series of fierce spear thrusts, forced him to retreat in disarray. Zhou Yuji thrust his spear to pursue, but unexpectedly the warhorse he was riding was exhausted and suddenly collapsed, kneeling on the ground and throwing Zhou Yuji off his saddle. The bandit general was overjoyed and was about to turn his horse's head to capture Yuji when Zhou Yuji roared like a tiger and leaped up from the ground, sweeping his whip, reversing the situation and striking the bandit general, causing his brains to burst and die. When another bandit general charged, Zhang Lie chopped off half of his head with a single blow from behind. With the death of two generals in a row, the bandits were even more shocked and retreated one after another. Zhou Yuji was still thinking about his old mother, wife, and children at home, so he and Zhang Lie, along with seven or eight wounded soldiers, rushed out of the alley and killed their way to their own home. Li Zicheng heard that Zhou Yuji was so brave that it was difficult to capture him by force, fearing that he would escape, so he ordered the archers to release their arrows. At this time, there were bandits on both sides of the houses, and Zhou Yuji saw them clearly. Everyone drew their bows and released their arrows, and the arrows flew like locusts, flying towards Zhou Yuji's side. Zhou Yuji threw away his spear, wielding his iron whip, leaping and dodging on foot, killing dozens of people with his bare hands. The shadow of the whip flew horizontally, and many arrowheads fell to the ground and piled up. (119)
