Editorial

### Axis Powers’ Two Heads Meet to Discuss Future of European War

On the first day of this week, Hitler and Mussolini had their sixth meeting at the Brenner Pass. According to past precedents, every meeting between the two of them is followed by major actions. Therefore, it was widely expected that the Axis powers would launch a new offensive in the near future. This situation has not changed due to the decline of Italian forces. However, given Hitler's brilliant military strategy, he often succeeds by surprise whenever he has an intention, and avoids the policies that the world commonly guesses, such as the so-called spring offensive this year, which has not yet broken out on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel. This time, the capture of Crete Island with a brand-new strategy and a huge price was also unexpected. From the current situation, the most urgent areas are naturally Cyprus and Syria in the eastern Mediterranean. However, it does not seem necessary for the two heads to hold consultations simply for the purpose of continuing the eastward advance. Let us leave this question to Hitler himself to answer, and here we will briefly review the overall situation of the European War.

In the past year, Hitler has achieved record-breaking achievements, and his achievements are not accidental, but mostly due to excellent strategy and agile actions. Even those who oppose him cannot deny this. However, from the perspective of geographical division, his achievements are limited to the European continent. Apart from the Soviet Union in the northeast, the Italian peninsula in the southwest, and the small areas of Switzerland and [unintelligible] which cannot cross the boundary, whether he can achieve the same achievements still needs to wait for new tests. It is true that his capture of Norway and Crete both crossed a sea, but strictly speaking, the Scandinavian Peninsula cannot be forcibly separated from the European continent, and Crete is only a narrow strip of water away from Greece – especially from the Aegean islands occupied by Germany. Therefore, these facts cannot be used to prove the achievements of Nazi overseas activities. Judging from the past course of events, the Axis powers have failed everywhere outside Europe. The freezing of deposits, the confiscation of merchant ships, and even smaller incidents are still happening. The complete collapse of Italy's East African empire is even more tragic than the fate of German Southwest Africa in the previous world war. The nearby powder keg has already exploded in Iraq, but it was quickly quelled by the British before large-scale German reinforcements could arrive. The entire American continent is now more or less in opposition to the Nazis. Most of the political entities in other parts of the world are also enemies of the Axis powers. Only a struggling and exhausted Japan is the only friendly country that Germany and Italy can take comfort in in the vast universe. However, what Japan is pursuing at this moment is first and foremost its own victory and expansion. Its alliance with the Axis powers is only to achieve this goal, and it is not necessarily due to emotional differences between totalitarian and democratic countries. Although the rumors that Japan will actively contain the United States have been rampant in recent days, it cannot be compared with those democratic countries that unconditionally support the war and link their own destiny with it. To sum up, in this year, Hitler succeeded in Europe, but achieved nothing outside Europe. The only alliance of the three powers did not gain any assistance because of it, and the resulting backlash has become increasingly strong, to the point where another powerful country is on the verge of joining the war. Controlling the entire European continent naturally cannot be underestimated, but facing the rest of the world with a European continent, and with the Axis powers having no naval power at all, they must be feeling pressured, right?

The strength that the Nazis currently possess is more than enough to control the European continent, but it still feels insufficient to deal with problems outside Europe. If they are really preparing to engage in a new European order, as yesterday's rumors from [unintelligible] claimed, then that is another matter. If they are still determined to defeat Britain, then where they will start next is a huge problem. Cyprus, Syria, Egypt, and Gibraltar could all be chosen as targets of attack, and there is also a possibility of success. However, for Britain, which is like a centipede, it is not easy to kill it by severing its limbs. Even after a long time, and with both sides exhausting their strength, they may not be able to achieve their goal. The outcome of the Battle of Crete, where the German army succeeded, and the strategy of betting everything regardless of consumption is not to be followed. After this experiment, the attempt to invade Britain may not be easily tried. If the Nazi strategy continues to focus on the struggle for hegemony in the Mediterranean and the Near East, then regardless of the weakness of its own scattered strength, and simply extending and expanding the war, it will at most only be considered to consolidate the periphery of the occupied areas of Europe, and the distance from the goal of defeating Britain will become more and more distant.

In the current stage of the European War, within the scope of Europe, there is no room for force, and outside the periphery of Europe – with the exception of the British Isles – there is also a lack of factors that play a decisive role. The actual participation of the Soviet Union is unlikely until the last moment; currently, only the United States in the west and Japan in the east are potentially important forces, and both are already on the verge of joining the war. Only by achieving favorable developments on this issue can the fate of the future be determined; and the relationship with the United States is far more important than that with Japan. Whether Hitler and Mussolini took note of this in their meeting is unknown, but even if they did, they lack the power and confidence to control the development of the future. This is something the Axis authorities can do nothing about.

### Britain's Active Military Deployments Resolute to Defend the Near East Will Declare Syria as Enemy-Occupied Territory To Consolidate Control Over the Eastern Mediterranean Beirut Oil Depots Bombed Twice by British Aircraft

London - Well-informed sources in London anticipate that the War Cabinet will soon decide to declare Syria as enemy-occupied territory, allowing British forces to launch a large-scale offensive into Syria. Hitler and Mussolini's sixth meeting since the start of the war has led to widespread speculation about the Axis powers' next target. Observers believe the Axis leaders intend to advance through Cyprus and Syria to Iraq and Palestine, aiming to cut off the British Air Force's communication in the Middle East before the Axis forces in Libya attack the Suez Canal. (4th Reuters dispatch)

London - A Reuters military correspondent reports that although the fall of Crete is unfortunate and increases the difficulties faced by the British Navy, Britain remains the master of the Mediterranean. Effective air support is a necessary adjunct to naval warfare, and its effectiveness depends on the presence of extensive airbases. This is something the British Navy is well aware of. The British Navy's base in Alexandria has a long coastline for protection, with airfields along the coast. The plains adjacent to the coast can also be used to build more airfields as needed. The Mediterranean coast forms a triangle, with Egypt to the south and Palestine and Syria to the east serving as its aerial shield. Within this triangle lies the island of Cyprus, which is owned by the British and can also be used as an airfield to strengthen British air control in the eastern Mediterranean. However, if the Vichy government allows the Germans to station their air force at Syrian airfields, this control will be greatly weakened. This is what Britain must do its utmost to prevent, hence the need for immediate action without hesitation. Weak measures must be abandoned. The Vichy government can be seen as unfriendly to Britain, but Vichy is not supported by half of the French people or half of the French army. This half of the military and civilian population hates the Nazis and is willing to join the democratic countries in the war as soon as they receive assistance. The Free French leader in the Middle East, General Catroux, is in Egypt, and General de Gaulle is probably there as well. Now is the time for the Free French to immediately occupy Syria. If the British Air Force is firmly positioned along the entire coast of the eastern Mediterranean, from Aleppo to Haifa, and is protected by the bases in Iraq, the Persian Gulf, and Cyprus, then the naval base in Alexandria will be as solid as a rock. Failure to quickly occupy Syria will hinder everything. Now that the situation is precarious, Britain must not hesitate to use its authority. Once the Syrian airfields are in British hands, control of the eastern Mediterranean will be assured. (4th Reuters dispatch)

Beirut - This morning, British aircraft braved intense anti-aircraft fire to bomb oil depots on the outskirts of Beirut, setting them on fire. French defense forces on the ground launched a fierce barrage of fire for fifteen minutes. (4th Associated Press dispatch)

### Marshall Appointed Commander-in-Chief Location of Headquarters Kept Secret

London - Today's London Gazette announced the appointment of Lieutenant General Sir Marshall Cornwall as Commander-in-Chief, effective from April 14th.

He reportedly discussed matters with the Turkish General Staff with other British officers. Marshall is one of the army's most capable generals. One commentator said that his headquarters will likely be kept secret because he served as the British military attaché in Berlin from 1928 to 1932, and the Germans may know his methods and characteristics. Marshall is 54 years old and fluent in eight languages. (4th Reuters dispatch)

A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said, "If British troops attack Syria, what will happen will first be a Franco-British event, as it will first be seen what action the French will take. What can be pointed out is that France is currently acting in accordance with the terms of the armistice, and Germany is of course prepared to adjust these terms to give France ample room for action to fulfill its sacred duty of defending French territory."

### Germany Seeks to Obtain Administrative Rights in Syria Troop Landings Still Difficult to Confirm

London - Diplomatic circles report that at the meeting in the Brenner Pass on Monday, Hitler and Mussolini planned to obtain administrative rights in Syria from France. The Axis powers may soon send troops to Syria "at France's request" to protect it.

Reliable neutral diplomatic sources strongly claim that three German mechanized divisions and two battalions of light tanks, along with paratroopers and blitzkrieg experts, have arrived in Syria. Government sources confirmed that one or two ships carrying German supplies have arrived in Syria, but emphasized that because the British Navy is patrolling the area, large German convoys cannot reach the area.

Rome - It has now been confirmed that Hitler and Mussolini met for five hours in the Brenner Pass on Monday and agreed on extremely important new actions. The "Telegraph News" newspaper, run by Ciano, stated that the results will be seen within a few months. (4th Reuters dispatch)

Rome - Strict secrecy surrounds the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini in the Brenner Pass. The commentary published by renowned Italian journalist Gayda only emphasized the importance of the timing of the meeting, stating that shortly after the two leaders met on January 20th, fierce battles broke out in North Africa and the Mediterranean. Today's meeting is probably a prelude to the preparation of a new offensive. (4th Havas dispatch)

Gayda also said that Hitler and Mussolini undoubtedly studied the results of the recently concluded battles and decided on new strategic steps. This strategy will be launched by the victorious Axis forces. Now a new offensive is about to begin. Britain will inevitably appeal to the United States, but the Axis powers can concentrate military and political forces for offense or defense in Europe and other parts of the world.

Italian Territorial Demands on France Believed to Be Under Discussion

The "Lausanne Tribune" in the Swiss capital recently reported that after French Associate Darlan made a speech in Paris, the leaders of Germany and Italy met in the Brenner Pass, which has raised some subtle questions. The most likely is the question of Italy making territorial demands on France. The purpose of Italy's participation in the war is to dominate the Mediterranean, so it has to demand that France transfer important bases along the Mediterranean coast to Italy. However, Associate Darlan said in a speech on May 23rd that Hitler had not demanded any colonies from France and that France had no intention of giving up sovereignty over any of its territories. It can be seen that this meeting of German and Italian leaders must be related to Italy's demands on France. (3rd Havas News Agency dispatch)

Budapest - Political observers here say that although Italy's goal is to expand its territory, it may abandon certain demands on France in consideration of French-Spanish cooperation, so as to concentrate its forces on operating new territories in the eastern Mediterranean. In this regard, Hungarian Foreign Minister Bardossy's visit to Rome is of great significance, because Hungary believes that its own interests are fully in line with the plans proposed by the Axis powers. (3rd Havas dispatch)

The Future of German-Soviet Relations One Saying Accounts for the Main Issue

Tokyo - According to reports obtained by the local newspapers, although the issues discussed by Hitler and Mussolini this time are numerous, the future of German-Soviet relations is the most important. Its importance seems to be above the issue of US intervention, the situation of French-German negotiations, and future combat plans. For example, according to a dispatch from a "Yomiuri Shimbun" reporter stationed in Rome, German and Italian authorities recently conducted talks, and the German side tried its best to encourage the Soviet Union to supply Germany with wheat from Ukraine and oil from the Caucasus, so as to avoid taking "tough actions." Another Allied News Agency reporter in Berlin said that what Hitler and Mussolini discussed was what "tough suggestions" to make to the Soviet Union in the political, economic, and military fields.

Building a New Order in Europe Is Being Studied Meticulously

Swiss Capital - According to sources from Rome, the issues discussed by the leaders of Germany and Italy in the Brenner Pass are gradually becoming clear. The results of the meeting may be officially announced as a prelude to peace. For example, the "Tribune of Rome" published news about the Brenner Pass meeting under the title "The Cradle of the New Europe," and said that Britain has been driven out of Europe, and Europe itself can build a new order. Therefore, for Europe to move from a state of war to a state of peace, it must wait for the Axis powers to achieve final victory. The semi-official "Italian People's Daily" also stated, "What should be discussed at this meeting between the leaders of Germany and Italy is not only the issue of war, but also the issue of the reconstruction of Europe after the war." In addition, the "Telegraph News," the organ of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, also said, "The decisions made by the leaders of Germany and Italy have extremely important implications for the development of the future situation." In this regard, the authorities of Germany and Italy have already believed that the current European war is about to come to an end, and they can begin their work of rebuilding Europe. This meeting of the leaders of the two countries is probably a study of this possibility. (3rd Havas News Agency dispatch)

### Franco-British Relations Deteriorating Important Meeting of the French Cabinet General Weygand Also Present

London - According to news from Vichy, the French cabinet met twice yesterday to discuss events such as Franco-British relations. The nature of the importance is not concealed by the Vichy side. A semi-official communiqué announced that the second cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon was "worthy of attention." At the first cabinet meeting yesterday morning, Chairman Pétain and Weygand, who flew here from North Africa, also attended. The general public is particularly concerned about Weygand's attendance, because Weygand is not only currently serving as Vichy's chief representative and commander-in-chief in North Africa, but before returning to the country to succeed Gamelin as commander-in-chief of the French region, he served as commander-in-chief of the Middle East Allied Forces, with headquarters in Syria. Moreover, Weygand served as Chief of Staff to General Foch during the Great War and is very familiar with the British. A section on discussing Franco-British relations in the French official communiqué is seen in this way. The communiqué stated that Vice Premier Darlan made a statement on Franco-British relations before returning to Vichy. "The French government is studying the situation created by this." In addition, the Lyon Radio Station stated that the cabinet meeting in the afternoon was chaired by Darlan and convened after continued talks between Weygand and Pucheu. Several ministers who do not often attend cabinet meetings, such as Colonial Minister Platon, also attended yesterday. (4th Reuters dispatch)

According to news from Vichy, the Vichy cabinet resolved to defend Syria to repel British forces. It is reported that General Weygand has been ordered to implement the French defense procedures passed by the cabinet. (4th Reuters dispatch)

Darlan's Remarks Turkish Outrage

London - The Turkish Radio Station broadcast a criticism of the recent remarks made by Vichy Vice Premier Darlan regarding Turkey, and quoted the Turkish newspapers as saying, "Darlan's anti-British rhetoric contains words that could hurt the feelings of the Turkish people. Darlan is prepared to hand over the entire of France and its colonies to Germany, and yet he regrets that France failed to obtain the Adana region from Turkey, which is ridiculous." A certain newspaper in Istanbul asked, "Do Vichy politicians not know that criticizing Britain for the resolution of the Alexandretta issue is demeaning?" (4th Reuters dispatch)

Ankara - Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu made an official statement on diplomatic affairs at a secret cabinet meeting. It is reported that Saracoğlu commented on the references to Turkey in the recent statements made by Admiral Darlan. (4th Reuters dispatch)

### The Abolished German Emperor Wilhelm Died: The Culprit of the Last European War Ended as Such

Doorn, Germany's abolished Emperor Wilhelm II, passed away here at 11 o'clock this morning. Except for a small number of German "royalists," the abolished emperor, exiled here, had been almost forgotten by the world. The abolished emperor was eighty-two years old and had been suffering from pulmonary vascular obstruction for several weeks. The funeral is now scheduled to be held here tomorrow. It is said that before his death, the abolished emperor left a will, wishing to be buried in Doorn rather than return to Germany for burial. The abolished emperor was once accused by the world of being responsible for the First World War. Now, during the Second World War, he suddenly passed away. This gray-haired old man was the last emperor of Germany. When he ascended the throne in 1888, he was determined to emulate Wilhelm the Great and make his name known in history. However, thirty years later, the forgotten abolished emperor had become a rural gentleman living in the Doorn villa in the Netherlands. Although the abolished emperor was in exile, there were still a few royalists who admired him as the supreme ruler. The abolished emperor fled to the Netherlands on November 10, 1918, because his army was plotting a rebellion. Therefore, the abolished emperor fled in fear of his life. When the German army occupied the Netherlands in May last year, it passed through Doorn without disturbing the abolished emperor. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)

London, according to an official announcement from Berlin today, the abolished German Emperor Wilhelm II passed away at 11 o'clock this morning after a long illness, at the age of eighty-two. Before his death, he expressed his wish to be buried in Doorn, and his descendants will follow his wishes. Wilhelm was the grandson of Queen Victoria of England and the nephew of King Edward VII of England. He was the most hated person in England for several years. Wilhelm was the initiator of the European War in 1914. At first, he was unstoppable, but later, due to the adoption of unrestricted submarine warfare, he angered the United States and resolutely joined the war, and Germany began to collapse. Revolution broke out in the country, and Wilhelm had no choice but to flee to Doorn, the Netherlands, to pass the time by logging. The establishment of the Treaty of Versailles declared Wilhelm a war criminal. On January 16, 1920, the Allied countries formally requested extradition, but were rejected by the Dutch government. In February 1940, newspapers in New York published an unexamined letter from Wilhelm to his friend Petchero, stating that the warring countries should stop the war and jointly assist Finland to save the world and civilization from the spread of Bolshevism.

A Brief Biography of Wilhelm II

Berlin, Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, passed away at 11:30 this morning in the Doorn Mansion in the Netherlands, at the age of eighty-two. The Emperor was born on January 27, 1859, in the Crown Prince's Palace in Berlin. His father was Crown Prince Frederick (who later ascended the throne and reigned for only 100 days), and his mother was Princess Victoria, the daughter of Queen Victoria of England. The Emperor's childhood teacher was Xingzi Peter, who enlightened his interest in social issues and guided his development of physical education. Later, he studied at Kassel High School and passed the exam with distinction. After graduation, following the Prussian custom, he joined the army as an officer in 1877 and was promoted rapidly. In 1880, he was promoted to Lieutenant General of the Army and was responsible for commanding the Second Army Brigade. The Emperor studied law and politics at Bonn University for two years. In 1880, he married Princess Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein and had six children. The Emperor ascended the throne on June 15, 1888, and was called Emperor Wilhelm II. The Emperor disagreed with Prime Minister Bismarck, and Bismarck resigned on March 20, 1890. In November 1918, a revolution broke out in Germany. On the 10th of that month, the Emperor went abroad to take refuge in the Netherlands. Finally, he abdicated on the 28th of that month. In 1920, he moved into the Doorn Mansion. In April 1921, his original wife passed away, and he remarried the following year. His second wife was Princess Homeming. Since moving to the Netherlands, the Emperor has not been involved in politics, but he is very concerned about the strength of Germany. (Haitong dispatch from the 4th)

### Nazis Conduct Extensive Propaganda Activities in Syria, Striving to Sow Discord Among the Faithful, Distributing Food to Show Goodwill to the People

Istanbul, it is learned here that the German side is conducting quite active propaganda among Muslims in Syria, making extensive incitement on the issue of Jews, and distributing food. One hundred and twenty carts of sugar, wheat, rice, and aviation oil have arrived in Aleppo. The food is distributed to the people, and the gasoline is kept for the use of the German Air Force. As far as the local ethnic groups are concerned, experts believe that Syrian Christians are openly pro-British. Even among the Shia Muslims in the minority ethnic groups, the Sui propaganda has not been successful. As for the French in the area, their emotions are mixed. It is heard that the French authorities in Syria recently dispatched three French fighter jets to drive away British aircraft over the Lyak flight port. Two of the French aircraft actually flew into Palestine to join the British side. The main oil refinery in Tripoli, Syria, was severely damaged in early May. Those who have recently come to Turkey from Syria say that whoever occupies Syria first, whether it is the Central side or the Sui side, will encounter very little resistance, because the people of Syria seem to hate Vichy's mismanagement and welcome the rapid restoration of law and order. There are no German soldiers in Syria yet, only a large number of German air force personnel and airport service staff. However, according to a Syrian expatriate, the Germans are becoming more powerful and active. The British should not delay any longer. The Germans are trying their best to provoke discord among the various religions, so if riots and infighting occur among the various religions at any time, it is expected.

### Fu Deyiyi Discussed and Decided to Force the United States to Join the War Immediately. Germany Does Not Allow Japan to Stay Out of the World. The United States Pays Attention to the Negotiations Between Japan and the Dutch East Indies.

Washington, "Scripps Howard News Service," is a famous commentator, Sims. He wrote yesterday that the American military believes that the Axis powers have made various indications to prove that they have decided to take preemptive measures against the United States, trying to force it to join the war before the United States is ready. Sims said that the military believes that this decision was made by Hitler and Mussolini at the Brenner Pass meeting. He also said that many Axis leaders firmly believe that now is the time to drag the United States into the war. Many Japanese leaders also support this view. These leaders believe that the current arms production in the United States is very small. Once the country joins the war, it will not be able to help Britain. Sims also said that the right to preempt is undoubtedly in the hands of the Axis powers. Hitler can pull the United States into the vortex of war at any time he deems appropriate. He also said that President Roosevelt had guaranteed that he would not send troops to participate in the war unless attacked, but said that he would ensure that American aid would reach Britain. Germany and Italy have been thinking about the United States joining the war for several months. They have repeatedly decided to instigate Japan to drag us in. Japanese politicians are not so foolish as to do this. They want the war to progress further. However, now that Germany has rescued Italy, the Balkans have been pacified, Britain's lifeline has been threatened, and France has allowed cooperation with the Axis powers in the Atlantic, the Axis powers can drag the United States into the war at any time. It is rumored that Hitler has decided not to allow Japan to have any more excuses for staying out of the war, and believes that since the Axis powers will eventually fight the United States one day, it is better to do it before the United States is ready.

Washington, Secretary of State Hull declared yesterday that the government is paying attention to the trade negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, and hinted that there is no reason to be surprised by these negotiations. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)

Japan's Pro-German Faction Will Have New Activities, Targeting the Dutch East Indies as the Next Goal

London, according to Reuters' Far East correspondent, after observing various phenomena, the pro-German faction, incited by the German fifth column in Japan, is now preparing to have new activities in the Far East. Now that Japan has achieved its goals in Vietnam, it is targeting the Dutch East Indies as the next goal. President Roosevelt's speech last week did not mention escorting or joining the war, which the Japanese were very pleased to hear. The stock market prices rose unanimously. If the American president had mentioned escorting or joining the war, Germany would have forced Japan to fulfill its obligations under the Tripartite Pact and declare war on the United States. At this time, the German ambassador to Japan, Woerthe, hurriedly went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit Matsuoka, and told him in affirmative terms what Hitler expected of Matsuoka. The next day, Matsuoka published an article, stating that he believed that the rumor that Japan's attitude towards the Tripartite Pact was indifferent was false, and declared that it was absolutely impossible to have the illusion that Japan would not faithfully fulfill its obligations under this pact. At the same time, the Dutch East Indies government's firm rejection of Japan's demands has aroused the Japanese government's anger, and given the pro-German faction an opportunity to show its loyalty to the Axis powers on the one hand, and to seize practical benefits on the other. At the end of last week, the Japanese government formally notified the Dutch East Indies, asking it to reconsider Japan's so-called insincere attitude. Japanese newspapers said that they had asked Britain not to obstruct the agreement between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese-Dutch negotiations began in October last year and have been dragging on until now. Japan has gained nothing except more oil supply. The attitude of the Dutch East Indies has always been consistent. It is willing to trade on the basis of good neighborliness, but insists that goods transported to Japan must not be transferred to Germany, and that Japan must not transport its own goods to Germany in the same way, and take Dutch East Indies goods to make up for its lack of ancestral guarantees. It is unwilling to accept Japanese demands of a political nature. Matsuoka's remarks a few months ago, listing the Dutch East Indies within the scope of Japan's East Asian New Order, have made the Dutch East Indies very dissatisfied. At that time, the Dutch government issued a statement in London, refuting it severely. The Dutch East Indies' attitude is firm for two reasons. One is that the United States has very large interests in the Dutch East Indies, estimated to be worth no less than 1.5 billion US dollars. The Dutch East Indies' rubber exports to the United States account for 38%, and the Dutch East Indies' oil production controlled by the United States accounts for 40%. The United States also has automobile factories and shipyard in the Dutch East Indies. The other is the deployment of military equipment in the Dutch East Indies. Since October last year, it has gathered a large army and imported a large number of new aircraft from the United States to strengthen its air force. Although the Dutch East Indies navy is small, it is quite efficient. The Dutch East Indies has also disguised its factories, implemented blackout controls, and severely cleared the fifth column, and has already taken precautions, not only relying on the support of the United States.

It also said that Turkey had informed Germany that if Germany defeats Britain, Turkey would be willing to cooperate with Germany in the new order after the war.

### Talks on the European War (6) (1) A Comprehensive View of the Atlantic War

News of the European War has always focused on the Mediterranean, but people in the British government know that even Prime Minister Churchill has said, "Everything depends on the victory or defeat of the Atlantic War."

In this unprecedented war, Britain and Germany are engaged in a life-and-death struggle, and the scope of the battlefield is very broad. Here is a vast expanse of water covering thousands of miles, shrouded in thick fog. Some places have dangerous winds and waves, while others have clear blue waves, like a shallow smile. There are also some places that are dark and gloomy, as if frowning.

However, the vastness of this battlefield is not limited to this. The two sides are only fighting at sea, with British search ships chasing German submarines, and German raiding ships also attacking British convoys. The war has also penetrated deep into the rear, reaching the peaceful villages of Britain, where farmers are working hard to cultivate. In fact, the war has reached every family in Britain. In short, this Atlantic War is currently taking place in the sky, on the sea, and under the sea at the same time.

At a certain entrance in Britain, a convoy is working hard to move forward. Faster ships slow down to wait for their slower sister ships. Angry lights flash from the leading ship. An old naval officer—perhaps a retired naval officer who has been unearthed from an armchair in the military fraternity—paces back and forth in the wheelhouse, cursing the ships he leads for not being as methodical as the Mediterranean fleet he once commanded. There are destroyers lurking and taking care of them in front and on the left and right, like sheepdogs tracking fat old ewes. Above, there is also a Hertson bomber, or a Sunderland flying boat from the Coastal Air Force Command, buzzing and circling, following the convoy and searching the sea.

A small, inconspicuous black pole protrudes from the sea surface and disappears in an instant. The lookout on top suddenly becomes tense, turning around and roaring loudly. A series of bubbles on the surface of the water rush straight towards a ship in the convoy. She dodges urgently, but it is too late. Just as the whistle blows, a huge torpedo cuts her in half with a deafening roar. The sea surface is instantly covered with oil. As she sinks, small boats are lowered one after another to carry people to escape. The other ships in the team zigzag like crazy to avoid the attack.

The accompanying destroyers circle around, leaving white streaks on the sea surface. The escort aircraft also hover uncertainly above.

In the wheelhouse of the destroyer, a person with a headset on his head issues simple orders. The captain says a word into the telephone and issues a signal again. Two sharp explosions sound behind. On both sides of the destroyer, a depth charge flies out. In an instant, the seawater leaps, like when a spoon hits a puree and the juice splashes. The remaining destroyers also turn their heads like water snakes and head straight for the place where the bomb exploded. At that time, it seems that the entire sea is boiling.

Perhaps nothing is gained, and this hunt ends. Or a cigar-shaped object emerges from the water, and the sound of artillery is followed by the explosion of depth charges. Or a few frightened and desperate crew members escape death and are lucky enough to be rescued. That night, the London Admiralty issued a communiqué stating that an enemy submarine had been destroyed.

But in the London Shipping Department, there are also officials with gloomy faces who are crossing out ship names on the ship list. In the Aircraft Manufacturing Department and the Army and Navy Departments, the lights are bright, and they are busy readjusting their plans due to the loss of aircraft, artillery, or raw materials.

On the other hand, the driver comfortably leans on his seat, the pilot manipulates the instruments, the bomber looks at the sight, and the lights on the airfield behind the fuselage gradually dim and finally disappear. The target of this aircraft is a port used by German submarines as a nest. After an hour of night flight, it has reached the airspace over the French coast, advancing towards Lorit at high altitude. A line of light is seen in the distance, and the pilot happily exhales. The driver knows that this light is the fire set by his companion an hour ago, and flies quickly towards the fire.

The aircraft soars over German Le Leidenni. The nose of the aircraft stops above the fire, and at this time, the fire has gradually increased, not just a line of light. The flames are also clearly visible, and there are many black shadows.

The driver nods and pulls the control stick forward. The fuselage begins to dive, and the anti-aircraft fire below fires at the same time. Shells explode into balls of sparks around the top, bottom, left, and right of the aircraft, and the fuselage shakes violently. Searchlight beams sweep across the sky. The driver finds the target, and then tilts, turns, and slides down lower.

The bombardier lies on the nose of the aircraft, one eye watching through the sight, and constantly shouting into the microphone, "To the left, to the right, a little to the left, a little more to the right, forward, forward, to the front" and other slogans.

He suddenly presses the button, and the bombs fall one by one, and the fuselage jumps up at the same time. The signal pole falls on the dock, and the explosions continue one after another, and the sparks rush straight into the sky.

The control stick is pulled back, and the fuselage rises straight up. When it reaches a high altitude, it turns its head down again and repeats the same process as before. Finally, it rises above the range of searchlights and anti-aircraft guns, and turns its head back to the camp. Behind, a raging fire is seen, illuminating the sky. On the way back to camp, it may meet an aircraft performing the same mission. The report of the bombing of the base used by German submarines to attack the Atlantic route is also passed on one after another at the Bombing Command in the morning.

German soldiers and conscripted Frenchmen put out the fire all night, and the next morning, they rush between the damaged houses and the port. The tilted ships are towed into the dock. The water gates and dock doors need to be repaired. When the fire is raging and the demolition team is clearing the ruins, the sound of the rolling machine may fill the air again.

On the other hand, the surface of the Thames Estuary is illuminated by the moonlight, turning into a silver color. The seaport several miles away is waiting quietly in the dark. A German aircraft is advancing towards the estuary in the distance, and the buzzing sound of the aircraft is heard in the air, gradually increasing. After a while, the fuselage descends, and the bomb doors are opened. Under the moonlight, a magnetic mine falls down. The parachute on the mine opens automatically, so that the mine falls gently on the sea surface, so that it does not explode before touching the seabed. (To be continued)

### Tensions in the Far East Have Not Abated, the United States Does Not Adopt a Policy of Compromise, and Will Use Swift Action to Sanction Aggression. Japan is So Neurotic That it Actually Believes in Concessions.

The Continental Daily News commented that recently, various postures expressed by the United States have made the Tokyo Electric Department believe that the United States has an intention of appeasing Japan, because President Nasford did not specifically mention Japan in his famous fireside chat. Various parties have also expressed that the United States does not seem to have any need to be hostile to Japan. For example, the New York Daily News published an editorial, requesting that the United States adopt a realistic attitude towards Japan in order to avoid the United States fighting Germany and Japan at the same time. Therefore, Japanese newspapers are discussing it, and they are taking a tough stance towards the Dutch East Indies. At the same time, Domei News Agency issued a message from Saigon, saying that the British expatriates there had received secret orders to prepare to evacuate, and made mysterious allusions to the Far East crisis.

American Policy Will Never Change

Japanese soldiers and politicians are complacent about these unimportant postures of the United States, and regard them as a sign that the United States is making concessions. The Japanese often make neurotic speculations about any action by the United States, but Chinese friends must not worry about this. The United States will never sell China to appease Japan. The Japanese seem to have ignored this point when they are elated. The Washington State Department has solemnly denied that the policy of the United States has undergone any changes. President Luo's famous remarks are indeed unsatisfactory, but today is the time for action, and empty words are useless in reality.

Urgent Need to Take Practical Action

The United States must make its own decisions and stop the threat posed by Japan in the Pacific region with swift steps. Japan is the weakest member of the Axis powers. Before the United States fights Germany, it should first deal with Japan. The United States should act decisively and resolve Japan first, so as to avoid future worries when fighting against Nazi aggressors. It must be known that there is no use in compromising with the Japanese to maintain peace in the Pacific. The result will be no benefit. Only by taking practical action can we win the awareness and respect of Tokyo. Therefore, we must advocate practical action, so that justice and goodwill can be seen in the Pacific region. rule.

### Hunter Preacher Returns to America for Rest - Shot Thirty-Four Tigers in His Lifetime, and Captured Giant Pythons, Fish That Swim Upstream, and Big Horn Sheep

Reverend George H.High, a pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who has resided in China for 41 years, has already boarded the Anqing ship to Xiamen, and will then return to the United States to treat his eye ailment and for rest. During his time in China, Reverend High traveled to various places and shot thirty-four tigers. He authored the book "Blue Tiger" and collected specimens for various natural science groups, amounting to as many as 22,000 species. Among these were newly discovered pythons, fish capable of swimming upstream in waterfalls, and record-breaking big horn sheep. Reverend High was always fond of tiger hunting. In Fujian, he often hunted in the mountains with local Chinese, using the opportunity to preach the gospel of Christianity to them. According to Reverend High, the best time for tiger hunting is on cloudy days, when tigers are more likely to leave their dens. Hunters use a small lamb as bait, and when the tiger approaches, they shoot it with a .25 caliber rifle, often delivering a fatal blow with a single shot. In addition to hunting tigers in China, Reverend High also hunted black bears and wild boars in Alaska and Russia. When asked which of the animals he hunted were the most dangerous, Reverend High replied that black bears were the most dangerous, followed by wild boars, and lastly tigers. Although hunting has been Reverend High's lifelong passion, he has never neglected his missionary work in China for the past eleven years.

### Cheap Foreign Rice Arrives - Rice Prices Set to Plummet - Changes to the Ordering Location for the Second Batch of Hong Kong Rice - Report Purchases with Insufficient Weight to the Police

According to shipping industry sources, the Tai Koo Company's Yuezhou ship arrived in port the day before yesterday (the 3rd) and docked at the Tai Koo Wharf. It carried 5,000 bags of low-priced Xiaojiao rice from the Public Works Department. Unloading was completed yesterday afternoon. According to a senior official of the Lap Kee Foreign Firm, a total of 165,000 bags of low-priced Xiaojiao rice arrived last month. As last month was the first month that Xiaojiao rice was sold in Shanghai at a low price, the quantity of foreign rice shipped to Shanghai was also half the usual amount. In the future, the Hong Kong government will definitely be able to supply 25,000 to 120,000 tons of foreign rice per month without any interruption. As a result, the prices of various types of rice continued to fall in the rice market yesterday. Xiaojiao rice fell to 110 yuan, the same as the low-price rice. Saigon broken rice fell to 87 yuan, but there were few buyers. It is expected that with the continuous influx of foreign rice, the price of rice in Shanghai will fall drastically.

Twelve Rice Merchants Jointly Undertake Orders

The first batch of low-priced Xiaojiao rice from the Public Works Department was ordered by Lap Kee, Shek Mao Foreign Firm, Tai Run, and seventeen other grain shops. The second batch of low-priced Xiaojiao rice will be ordered by twelve firms, including Ruichangfa. Retail rice shops in Shanghai who wish to purchase more low-priced Xiaojiao rice can directly contact these twelve grain shops. Their addresses are: (1) Ruichangfa, 53 Renjili, Xinzha Road; (2) Shengxing, 467 Jiangxi Road; (3) Gongda, 85 Maigaobao Road; (4) Zhengxingxie, 163 Julai Road; (5) Tai Run, 22 Yonganfang, Yongan Street; (6) Xiemao, 79 Fada Road; (7) Yuxing, 49 Taiheli, Baierbu Road; (8) Daheng, 1 Liheli, Beile Road; (9) Yifengjin, 110 Laoshenfu Road; (10) Hengfengtai, 20 Yulong Street; (11) Zhenxing, 29 Tianzhutang Street; (12) Xichangde, 208 Aiwen Road.

Report Insufficient Weight to the Police

According to a Public Works Department announcement, the department has recently received reports that certain rice shops selling the department's foreign rice are providing short weights. The matter is under investigation. The department's foreign rice is stipulated to be 80 kilograms (or 160 Shanghai catties) per shi (unit of dry measure), sold for 110 yuan. Citizens purchasing rice should weigh the amount received at the rice shop to verify the weight. If any short weight is discovered, please report it to the nearest police station for investigation. Furthermore, the workers involved in the strike at rice shops in the Public Concession will be released in full this morning at 9 a.m. The negotiations between the rice shop owners and labor representatives did not take place yesterday.

### Children's Welfare Association Issues Stock - Purchases Huile Garden Property - A Once-and-For-All Solution to Create a "Paradise for Destitute Children" - The Association Hopes Charitable Ladies and Gentlemen Will Generously Donate

When the Shanghai war broke out, refugees from all over flocked to the concessions. Their situation was extremely miserable, and many were homeless, spending their days begging on the streets. It was even more tragic. Led by Chen Heqin, the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association was organized to take in newsboy beggars, providing both relief and education, with remarkable results.

Three Locations for the Institute

The welfare institution initially rented premises at 190 Ningbo Road. Not long after, the landlord took back the property. Subsequently, through the introduction of Reverend Jiang Changchuan, they negotiated with Mr. Jiang Yuanhua, who generously lent the former St. Anna's dance hall on Zilin Road for free. However, the premises were small and the number of people was large, which was very cramped. Last winter, it merged with Huile Garden, which was run by Dr. He for the relief of destitute children.

Purchase of a New Site

Huile Garden is the property of the American Women's Missionary Society, located on Liyuan Road in the Nanshi district. The environment is secluded and covers six and a half mu of land. The open space is suitable for cultivating vegetables and raising chickens and rabbits to supplement production. Part-time work and part-time study truly make it a paradise for children. The landowner, in view of the association's relief of poor children, which is a charitable organization, voluntarily reduced the price and sold it for three thousand US dollars. After deliberation, it was decided to issue shares to solicit donations widely, hoping that benevolent gentlemen and ladies at home and abroad will uphold the principle of helping those in need and generously donate to accomplish this good deed. The "Shanghai Children's Welfare Association's Method for Soliciting Donations to Purchase Huile Garden Shares" is recorded below.

Share Subscription Method

The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association's Board of Directors hereby initiates the purchase of the entire base building of Huile Garden on Liyuan Road, Nanshi: (1) The base occupies six and a half mu; (2) A three-story western-style building; (3) A two-story building; (4) A large assembly hall; (5) A row of Chinese-style bungalows. It has been resolved to issue shares, approved for 100 shares, each share worth 1,000 yuan, totaling legal tender 100,000 yuan. The property rights of Huile Garden belong to the American Women's Missionary Society and are currently leased to the association for free for six months. Now, due to the need for funds to support the schools it runs in Shanghai, it is willing to sell it to the association for three thousand US dollars, equivalent to about 57,000 yuan in legal tender at the current exchange rate.

Shareholder Protection After the property is purchased, it will be leased to the welfare institute for an annual rent of one yuan. In the future, if the institute ceases operations or is subject to external pressure and mismanagement, the shareholders' board of directors has the right to terminate the lease agreement and lease it to other charitable organizations or sell the property, distributing the proceeds to the shareholders, but only with the consent of more than half of the shareholders. The above method allows donors to have the right to supervise and manage the recipients, which is completely different from ordinary donations where the donor has no right to inquire after the donation is made. Therefore, each shareholder who holds shares has the right to elect and be elected as a director. Once five directors are elected, they will form a board of directors, fully supervising the work of the welfare institute and providing the institute with cooperation and convenience.

Payment Method For the convenience of those who donate and purchase shares, in addition to those who pay in full at once, payments can be made in several installments within one year to facilitate flexibility. The payment location is the association at Room 4, 169 Yuemingyuan Road.

Expert Estimate According to the estimate of building engineer Yang Kuanlin, the reported selling price of Huile Garden is extremely low. Considering only the building construction, it is worth more than this amount. Moreover, there are several acres of open space. It is known that there are many who are vying to purchase this property. The property owner, knowing that the association is a charitable organization that provides relief, voluntarily reduced the price for the association to purchase it.

Use of Funds The entire base building of Huile Garden is worth far more than the selling price. The association will base it on the current market value of 100,000 yuan. After paying more than 57,000 yuan to the property owner, the remainder will be used to repair the houses and for equipment and furnishings, so that the welfare institute will become a paradise for many destitute children, making it a once-and-for-all solution.

### Salvation Army Sends Away Beggars

The Aim is to Help These People Become Self-Reliant, Gradually Reducing the Number of Beggars

Major Walker, commander of the Shanghai Salvation Army, stated yesterday that the army has been cooperating with the police to run a beggar shelter for the past five months, having accommodated over 1,800 beggars. In the first four months, a total of 188 beggars left the shelter. Recently, another 143 beggars were sent back to their hometowns, and 140 others who guaranteed not to beg again have also left the shelter. The Salvation Army plans to continue sending away several hundred beggars within one or two weeks. The ultimate goal of the shelter program is to enable beggars to become self-reliant, gradually reducing the number of beggars in the Public Concession, rather than permanently maintaining the lives of these vagrants.

### Child Protection Section Adopts Children - Holds a Kindred Meeting

The Public Concession's Public Works Department Child Protection Section, in order to connect with the families who have adopted children and enhance cooperation, has scheduled a meeting for the afternoon of the day after tomorrow at 3 p.m. at the Public Works Department Health Branch at 340 Hankou Road. All parents of adopted children have been notified and are expected to attend on time. In addition to speeches, there will also be singing and other entertainment.

### Public Works Department Abattoir - Rental Decision

The Shanghai Times reported that the Public Works Department abattoir, one of the department's newest properties, has been leased to the Japanese Livestock Market from June 1 for a period of one year. The Public Works Department issued a brief statement yesterday (the 3rd) afternoon, announcing that it had approved the lease of certain parts of the department's abattoir, such as the livestock pens, slaughterhouses, and cold storage rooms. The details were not announced yesterday, but well-informed sources confirmed that the Public Works Department can obtain a rent of 137,000 yuan. The inspection of various types of meat will continue to be carried out by the health department. The fees obtained by the Public Works Department for inspecting meat can reach at least 500,000 yuan per year. If all the livestock needed in the city is slaughtered there, the inspection fee can reach 750,000 yuan. Although the Public Works Department health department staff have inspected the equipment of the abattoir, the lease agreement has not yet been signed.

Public Works Department officials denied yesterday the rumor that the Japanese company had completely monopolized the livestock business by renting the abattoir. It is claimed that there are still two privately operated abattoirs in the two concessions, and that almost all the livestock from nearby areas is transported to Shanghai through this market. Therefore, after the market rents the department's abattoir, it can reduce the need for middlemen, and the price of meat can be reduced. What is most important, of course, is that the lease contract stipulates that all meat slaughtered in the abattoir must be subject to the Public Works Department health regulations. The Public Works Department abattoir is located on Shajing Road and is equipped with the latest facilities, capable of slaughtering 300-400 cattle, 2,000 pigs, 400-500 sheep, and over 100 calves per day. However, the number of livestock slaughtered at the abattoir in recent years has been far less than this number due to the scarcity of supply and the high price of meat, which has greatly reduced demand.

### Madam Yan of Dinghai Donates Large Sum for Disaster Relief

Sells Valuable Land Worth Tens of Thousands of Dollars

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Dinghai Relief Committee has been actively engaged in disaster relief, raising more than 100,000 yuan in donations. This money has been used to purchase rice and other grains. The relief measures vary depending on the order in which the affected villages reported the number of disaster victims.

Divided Relief

Those who reported earlier, such as the eleven villages of Maoao, Xiaosha, Dazhanmao, Xibaichan, Ganao, Xiedong, Beichan, Dongao, Jiacang, and Ziwei, were each given 50 bags of rice and 50 bags of other grains for both sale at a reduced price and free distribution. This is the first batch. Those who reported later, such as the nine villages of Dasha, Jin Yi, Jin Er, Jin San, Jinkou, Hejian, Cenmu, Dingbai, Yongdong, and Wuxie, were each given 50 bags of other grains for free distribution. This is the second batch. In total, the two batches have benefited more than 20 villages. For those villages that continue to report in the future, it is planned to provide relief according to the second batch's example, limited to the available donations. There is a fellow villager from the county living abroad, Madam Yan, who is charitable and generous. She initially donated 10,000 yuan, specifically for disaster relief in the Ganao township. Later, due to the large disaster area and the large number of disaster victims, she sent another letter to the committee, offering to sell all 26 mu of fertile land and 5 mu of reed land that she owns in Baichuan. The lowest price per mu is 1,000 yuan, with half of the proceeds to be used for disaster relief in Ganao and half for disaster relief in other counties. The committee believes that Madam Yan's compassion in helping those in need is commendable, and that her act of donating land for disaster relief will widely benefit the disaster victims. It is appropriate to fulfill her wishes and vigorously promote its success. It has been resolved to accept her offer and send a letter of thanks. The auction of the land will begin on June 25 and end. The matter of the auction is, in terms of the donation party, a matter of benevolence and helping the masses. The buyers compete to bid higher prices, so that the disaster victims can receive more benefits. Their virtue is also not insignificant. Therefore, the committee has the provision to send honorary commemorative gifts. It is hoped that the fellow villagers from Dinghai in Shanghai will actively participate in this auction. The higher the bid, the greater the merit. Once the transaction is successful, one will obtain good property and help a good cause, which is killing two birds with one stone. Please pay attention to this matter.

### Dismissal of Commercial Press Employees - Hearing of Response This Morning

The labor dispute between the Commercial Press and its employees has been ongoing for over a month without resolution. Previously, the management entrusted lawyer Wang Yaotang to issue severance pay, but the labor representatives refused to accept the money because they did not agree to the terms. Yesterday, the management published an advertisement to withdraw the payment location and separately notified each employee whose contract was not being renewed. In addition to requesting the Public Works Department Industrial Section to issue the second half of May's salary immediately, the representatives also hoped to start negotiations quickly and seek a resolution that is in line with their principles. Yesterday, both sides decided to meet with lawyer Wang Yaotang. Lawyer Wang stated that when the client entrusted him, they said that the labor and management sides had already reached a settlement with the Public Works Department Industrial Section. He was only entrusted with the payment procedures. He did not expect the matter to deteriorate so badly. The representatives said that since lawyer Wang was entrusted by the management, we can only ask lawyer Wang to be responsible and request that the employees whose contracts are not being renewed not be notified before labor and management reach an agreement. Lawyer Wang said that he would accept this and could inquire with the management about the solution. He will have a response this morning (the 5th) at 9 a.m.

### Brazilian Minister Returns to Peiping

Mr. and Mrs. Lecco (R.L. Delage), the Brazilian Minister to China, stayed at the Cathay Hotel after arriving in Shanghai last month, stayed briefly in Shanghai, and visited overseas Chinese leaders separately. They have now completed their official duties and left Shanghai by ship yesterday to return to Peiping.

### Coal Balls Will Be Re-Priced - Standard Selling Price

The price of coal balls has been raised privately, causing public outcry and indignation. It is understood that the concession authorities, in view of the fact that the increase in the price of coal balls is purely due to the manipulation and monopoly of large quantities of spot goods and the manipulation of the market, are now investigating the manufacturing cost of coal balls in the Valley Machine-Made Coal Ball Factory. They will notify the Shanghai Municipal Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association to try to re-determine the standard selling price, so as to ease the burden on the common people and maintain social order.

### Remittance Premium Disappears

In order to adjust the funds of the industry and meet the needs of industry and commerce, the Shanghai Silver Money Industry Association has been handling inter-industry remittances since July 1, 1939. After the remittances are used, the preparation is concentrated to facilitate circulation. A committee is formed to check the remittance preparations on a daily basis to show great credit. This remittance bill is deeply trusted by the certificate holders. Chinese and foreign banks and foreign firms are happy to accept and use it. At present, the remittance bill has the same effect as the check and cash. The past remittance premium has gradually decreased from a rate of 180 yuan per thousand yuan to between 50 cents and 1 yuan. Recently, the premium has disappeared invisibly. The remittance and the cash check are adjusted at the same price, and there is no need for a premium. This is really a good phenomenon in Shanghai's finance. It is because Chinese and foreign merchants have a considerable understanding of the new remittance code with a solid guarantee. The circulation volume of the new remittance was 29,999,900 yuan in national currency as of April 30 this year, and the total value of the collateral paid by each bank and village was 46,677,893 yuan, 3 corners and 9 cents in national currency, and was publicly inspected by the Inter-Industry Remittance Preparation Inspection Committee to verify that it complied with the regulations.

### Postal Service to Karachi Westward - Post Office Temporarily Suspends Acceptance

The post office announced that it has been approved by the Myanmar Post to inform that the British Overseas Airways line now goes through Yangon to Karachi, India, via Singapore. Airmail destined for countries west of Karachi should not be sent to the Yangon exchange bureau for transfer. With this approval, the bureau will stop accepting airmail destined for various places west of Karachi via the British Overseas Airways line.

### Soviet Bridge Issues Bonds - To Build General Association Hall - Including a Theater and a School - The Education System is Managed by the Soviet Government

The Soviet expatriate group in Shanghai held a meeting at the Soviet Overseas Chinese Federation on Sunday (the 1st) and passed a plan to build a new guildhall, including a theater and a school. It is said that the construction cost is estimated at US$100,000, and bonds will be issued at US$10 per bond. All Russian permits can be purchased. According to the authorities of the Soviet Overseas Chinese Federation, this move is purely commercial in nature and not a charitable undertaking. The bonds bear an annual interest rate of 4%, and the guildhall's real estate is used as collateral. It is understood that the first step will be to build a theater, and then build the general association hall and school. The facilities and curriculum of the school will be based on the current school system in the Soviet Union and will be directly managed by the Soviet government. Although the address of the new guildhall has not yet been determined, it is generally believed that it will be on the open space at the corner of Xiafei Road and Shanzhong Road.

### Manager of Shanghai Copper Factory Kidnapped - Constable Searches Gemen - Both Sides Exchange Multiple Shots, Each Injured - Rescued Hostage, Gangsters Eventually Escape

Jin Huating, 36 years old, a native of Shaoxing, the manager of the British-owned Shanghai Copper Manufacturing Co., Ltd. at 162 Guangdong Road, lived in the manufacturing plant of the company at 1200 Hede Road. At 12:40 noon yesterday, three kidnappers arrived at the factory in a car with a forged military pass number 359. The three kidnappers entered the factory, tied up Jin, and forced him into the car, which sped off to the west.

Detain Gemen

When the car drove to the vicinity of the Tietoukou near the Sakura Lane on Laobosen Road, the police officers stationed there stopped them for routine inspection. The police officers went forward to search them. Unexpectedly, the kidnappers, knowing that things were not going well, took the initiative and opened fire on the police officers. The police officers dispersed and returned fire. For a while, there was a great burst of gunfire. The kidnappers were no match and abandoned the hostage and fled. They soon disappeared. At this time, the police station had received the news and sent a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to encircle and arrest them.

Rescued Hostage

The hostage Jin Huating was escorted home. When the shooting occurred, police officers number 1063, 132, and 901 of the Third Hua Company were injured by the kidnappers' bullets. At the same time, one of the three kidnappers also had his face injured by a bullet fired by the police, but the kidnapper still managed to escape. Afterwards, the police station drove the kidnappers' car back to the police station for detention. It was also heard that when the kidnappers kidnapped Jin, they secretly followed Jin's relative, Lu, into the factory. After Jin was kidnapped, Lu's whereabouts became unknown. Therefore, the police station has strong suspicions about Lu and is currently investigating.

### Post Office Robbery - Continued Investigation

The Shanghai Times reported that Colonel Akiyama, a spokesman for the Japanese Army, told reporters yesterday (the 3rd) afternoon that the Japanese Military Police had solved the major robbery at the General Post Office last Saturday morning, recovering both the robbers and the stolen goods.

### Gangsters Rob Yitai Taxi, Attempting Kidnapping - Patrol Captain Actually Acts as a Kidnapper - Attempt to Kidnap Wang Fulin Fails

At 6:15 yesterday morning, two men and one woman suddenly came to Yitai Taxi Company on Fuzhou Road and hired a taxi. The taxi company dispatched car number 17719, driven by driver Tao Ying, to serve them. After the three passengers got into the car, they told him to drive to Hongqiao Road in the western suburbs of Shanghai. When they arrived there, two more men got in and told Tao to drive to Caobao Road. When they reached Bridge No. 3 on that road, it became clear that the male and female passengers in the car were gangsters.

The men and women in the car were gangsters

Two of the gangsters suddenly pulled out handguns, forced Tao out of the car, and tied him up with ropes, abandoning him by the roadside. The car was then driven away by the gangsters. At about 9 a.m., Tao was discovered tied up by passers-by, who reported it to the local security team. They rescued Tao and went to the Caohejing Corps. Unexpectedly, Tao spotted two gangsters walking on the road and went forward to arrest them.

Apprehended on the spot

The gangsters confessed their names as Zhou Zhongjie and Qiao Sifu (Patrol Team Captain). They also confessed that the two men and one woman who were on the run were named Wang Baofu, Chen Fugen, and Chen Jia Sao Sao, the wife of Chen Guisheng, a well-known rogue in Minhang. They confessed that after robbing the car, they planned to go to 13 Changxing Lane, Fuxi Road, to kidnap Wang Fulin, a compradore of a certain bank, but they were unsuccessful. They also confessed that in September last year, they

participated in a kidnapping

Only one handgun was found in Chen Fugen's home. The Yitai Taxi was found near Bridge No. 1 on Zhongshan Road at 9:30 a.m. The company sent someone to retrieve it.

### A LOSER SNATCHES A CAKE, A CHILD CHASES AND IS RUN OVER AND DIES

Since the increase in prices of goods in Shanghai, many vagrants roam the streets. Some, with no means of livelihood, resort to snatching food from others to fill their stomachs. This kind of phenomenon has been common. Unexpectedly, yesterday, a tragedy occurred. Yesterday morning at 9:45 AM, a child named Xie Pengfei (seven years old), a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 75 Xiangshun Lane, Rue Belier, French Concession, bought a cake from a cake stall across the street. Unexpectedly, a vagrant saw that he was young and immediately stepped forward to snatch his cake, fleeing wildly to the opposite sidewalk. The child, because his food was taken, immediately ran after him. While running onto the street, a trolleybus No. 175 of the French merchant, traveling from east to west, could not brake in time and knocked the child down in front of No. 110, across from the Jianshe Bookstore. Instantly, his brains splattered, and he died tragically under the wheels. Subsequently, the police arrived and dragged the child's body from under the wheels, sending the vehicle to the coroner's office, reporting for examination. It was truly tragic.

The US dollar initially eased and then rebounded slightly. After the market opened in the morning, a small amount of selling came from Hong Kong Electric, and Chinese speculators followed up with aggressive selling, causing the US dollar to rise from 5.34375 yuan to 5.40625 yuan around 10 o'clock, making it difficult to sell and settle. Because of the appetite of Mai Jia Li, the market, which was about to stop easing, was injected with another 100,000 US dollars from Hong Kong Electric, so it rebounded slightly to 5.375 yuan, up 0.03125 yuan. The British pound was flat at 3 shillings, 296875 yuan. Trading was thin in the first half of the day, and the market was closed on Wednesday afternoon.

### BULLISH CAMP SHAKEN, GOLD MARKET WEAK

Yesterday's gold market saw a dull black market performance, continuing to be lackluster. Because the US dollar was in a speculative selling trend, the bullish camp was shaken. New bullish parties, including Tong Kang Yong and Guangbang Heng, and the ticket merchants Dafeng and Xinfeng Yong (re-emerged), followed suit, and market sentiment was weak. The price fell from 6,450 yuan at the morning opening to 6,426 yuan around 10 o'clock. However, the US dollar eased slightly, and Xinfeng Yong, together with the securities group Defu, and retail short-sellers scrambled to cover, and the market rebounded slightly, ultimately up 23 yuan. Total trading volume in the first half of the day was 20,000 taels. The market was closed on Wednesday afternoon, and there was no off-market trading. Spot transactions were rare, and prices were weak. Wanfeng offered 10 taels of Zhongxing gold, with a price 300 yuan higher than the term price, later 290 yuan higher with no buyers.

Jewelry Gold Exchange Rate Unchanged

The exchange rate for jewelry gold in silver shops remained at 695 yuan per tael at Datongxing and Xintongxing, with a 40 yuan discount for purchases, it was said.

### GRAIN: RICE PRICES FALL BELOW GAINS

Yesterday's foreign rice market initially fell and then rose, remaining in consolidation. At the early market opening, due to the continued distribution of Hong Kong-Vietnam par-priced public sale rice, local households were quite sluggish in market transactions, and hoarders continued to release their holdings, causing spot and futures rice prices to continue downward. Subsequently, because Siamese rice telegrams were not transferred, major players attempted to maintain their positions, and domestic dealers and retail investors actively absorbed supply at lower prices, and the market slowly rose. No. 1 Saigon was sold at the lowest price of 116 yuan, No. 2 at 112 yuan, No. 2 at 107 yuan, Min Dang at 112-113 yuan, and Xiao Wen at 110 yuan, 109.5 yuan, a significant drop of 4-5 yuan compared to before. This prompted rural customers to take advantage of the cheap prices, and floating hoarders and retail investors also absorbed supply, and actual sales followed, and the situation gradually became active. Chinese speculators continued to sell at the same price, so it soon became difficult to sell and settle. HSBC's listed exchange rates remained unchanged, and the white silver balance tax was still levied at 2.25%. After 2.25%, speculators aggressively sold July US dollars at 5.40625 yuan, and the market hardened to settlement. Soon, Mai Jia Li absorbed 100,000 US dollars of July futures at 5.40625 yuan, and the intention to speculate short weakened. Suddenly, a telegram from Hong Kong reported that July futures were being sold at 5.375 yuan, and the market eased. At noon closing, spot prices and July futures were quoted at a British exchange rate of 3 shillings 296875 yuan and a US dollar exchange rate of 5.375 yuan, with British exchange rates flat and US dollar exchange rates down 0.03125 compared to the previous day's closing.

Hong Kong Had No Gains or Losses

Hong Kong, 4th (Wednesday) telegram, the exchange market opened flat this morning, with no gains or losses for all currencies. The market was closed on Wednesday afternoon.

Tianjin British and American Continued to Rise

Shanghai exchange rates fell by 2 yuan to 87 yuan. "Joint notes" on the black market were cheaper by 1.75 yuan to 65 yuan.

### Fresh Japanese Notes Still Being Pushed Up

Yesterday's foreign currency market conditions: black market prices were slightly weak, with British and American gold pounds also down by one yuan each. British gold tickets also tended to be dull, and market prices were stable.

Since the morning, the opening price per bar (ten taels) was 6,450 yuan, 9 yuan lower than the late closing price of the previous day. It was heard that US dollars could be settled at 5.375 yuan. Heng Ji, Cheng Ji, Shi He, De Cheng, Tong Kang Yong, and Da Feng all came to aggressively sell, and retail investors pressed sales, and Xinfeng Yong stopped buying and started selling, and the price gradually dropped by 24 yuan to 6,425 yuan. As Xinfeng Yong strongly entered the market again, Defu also bought, and July US dollars at 5.40625 yuan were difficult to settle, and the easing suddenly rebounded, and market sentiment strengthened, and retail short positions scrambled to cover, and the market was immediately pushed up to 6,444 yuan. However, Tong Kang Yong continued to sell, and the price fluctuated between 6,435-6 yuan and 6,442 yuan, with only a few yuan of fluctuation, until the noon closing price of 6,436 yuan, which was 23 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. Based on the settlement price of June US dollars at 5.375 yuan, it was 6,479 yuan, down 43 yuan. After closing, each price rose by 2-3 yuan, and No. 1 Saigon returned to 118.5 yuan, No. 2 to 113-4 yuan, Min Dang to 115.5 yuan, Xiao Wen to 112-3 yuan, Huo Jiao to 115 yuan, Qie Fo rice to 114 yuan, Tokyo polished tips to 103 yuan, and broken tips to 88-9 yuan. However, after a large drop and a small rebound, market sentiment was inevitably weaker, and after a movement, it returned to sluggishness, and until the close, it often only revolved around this price, without any change, so the result was still 2 yuan lower than the previous closing price. Yinghua Si's return to the original sentence Saigon No. 1 is now 136 yuan, Lu is 137 yuan, Xiao Jiao is from 135.5 yuan to 134 yuan, and Broken rice is from 102 yuan to 100 yuan, but the market again shouted higher by 1-2 yuan. 2-30,000 bags arrived throughout the day, with more than 10,000 bags sold, and 7-800 tons of original bags.

The situation of thick and thin japonica and domestic rice is completely different. Early and late rice are more active, while thick japonica is unusually quiet. This is because with the arrival of summer, consumers are not solely seeking rice quality, but are looking for fresh new products, and old goods are not welcomed. However, most of the thick japonica that has arrived is old, while early and late rice are the opposite. Most of the rice arriving in Shanghai is fragrant and fresh, so stores choose to purchase it to meet customer demand. Therefore, the thick japonica market is difficult to compete with early and late rice, and it is often inferior. Yesterday, because foreign rice continued to weaken, domestic rice was inevitably constrained. Although early and late rice depreciated, it was limited, with fresh special-grade goods from South China still requiring 137 yuan, and ordinary goods falling from 135 yuan to 132 yuan. Thick japonica saw a drop of more than 2 yuan, with Kunshan white japonica selling for 132 yuan, falling to 127-8 yuan, and no original bags were traded.

Sales of glutinous rice remain poor. In addition, with other goods uniformly weakening, the market is difficult to support, and prices have successively fallen by 2-3 yuan. Hong Kong white is priced at 112 yuan, 110 yuan, and high-grade glutinous tea is priced at 104 yuan, falling to 100 yuan. High-grade domestic yuan is priced at 120 yuan, falling to 116 yuan.

### FLOUR AND WHEAT BUSINESS QUIET

The spot market for foreign flour only saw slight transactions for Golden Dragon brand and Fortress brand flour. Fortress brand flour opened at 29.6 yuan, and Golden Dragon flour opened at 28.7-5 yuan. Zhonglou flour from foreign warehouses was priced at 29.6-7 yuan. Less than 10,000 bags were traded, down about half a yuan compared to before.

Wheat transactions: Because new wheat will soon be on the market, the market price is around 60 yuan per dan (old standard), and with transportation and miscellaneous expenses added, the total price is similar to that of old wheat in the Shanghai market, so factories are not eager to prepare for purchases.

### MISCELLANEOUS GRAINS: CORN AND BEAN CAKE SPECULATION UNPROFITABLE

Recently, the corn and bean cake market conditions: because actual sales are sluggish and speculation is unprofitable for bulls, the market is declining and difficult to reverse in the short term. Yesterday, corn continued to fall by more than 2 yuan, with more than 2,000 bags traded. The opening price of old Saigon corn was 23 yuan to 22 yuan, the price of new corn was 25.5 yuan to 24.5 yuan, the price of Dutch white corn was 25.2 yuan to 24.5 yuan, and the price of yellow corn was 27 yuan to 26.8 yuan. Shengji Cake World made more than 30,000 pieces of bean cake, with spot prices at 17.5 yuan, June upper May lower warehouse orders from 18.8 yuan to 18.1 yuan, and the closing price rebounded to 18.5 yuan and a half. June lower June upper warehouse orders from 19.5 yuan to 19 yuan, and the closing price rebounded to 19.3 yuan and a half.

### SECURITIES: PUBLIC BONDS CONTINUE TO RISE

The black market for public bonds continued to rise yesterday. Major bullish players added to their positions, while old bullish players sold off, but there was still unmet demand, and market sentiment was still very good. Yesterday morning, Yuxing and Hongda aggressively bought Huai bonds, and Xie Kang and Runde also purchased actively. Xinhua, Sheng Da Ren, Shuang Jiu Feng and other firms supplied bonds. Market prices were slightly firmer for C bonds, and there was no difference for the rest. In the afternoon, Yu and Hongda increased their purchasing power, with the two firms purchasing more than 600,000 yuan. Hengfu and Xinfu also purchased more than 100,000 yuan each. Tongkang bullish players took advantage of the high prices to sell off, totaling more than 500,000 yuan. C bonds were slightly pressured in the afternoon, so they sought a bull color. Yizhong and Lianhe also sold a significant amount. E bonds reached 7 yuan again, and B bonds reached the 70 yuan mark. Excluding D bonds, which were priced too high in the previous two days, all others rose by one to two and a half points. Transactions totaled around 3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock Trading: Transactions for 50 shares of Sincere Company, priced at 10.025 yuan.

The British firm Lee Brothers Motors Limited will pay an interim dividend on June 13, at 2 yuan per share in national currency.

The British firm Union Wharf Limited will pay an interim dividend of one yuan per share in national currency on June 30 for the one-year period ending September 30 of this year.

London, 3rd (Tuesday) telegram, today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks were flat, with no changes in prices.

The stock market in general was in a dull situation, and transactions were still not expanding. Many who were searching for goods were inclined to sell off and settle, and most of the market prices fell. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

### YARN AND COTTON: MAJOR DOUBLE HORSE PLAYERS OFFER SUPPLY, MARKET IS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY FUTURES PRICES

The yarn market is calm, but the actual situation has shown significant progress. Purchasing from Hong Kong has improved, with around 1,200 bales of coarse and fine yarns being bought, so some people are optimistic, and the market has rebounded after falling. However, some players came to sell off, and market sentiment was affected. Judging from the overall trend, it is still not outside the consolidation range. The high price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,434 yuan, and the low price was 1,417 yuan. The initial trading in the afternoon was 1,429 yuan to 1,430 yuan, falling to 1,426 yuan. The final price was 1,428 yuan. The market price in the afternoon was unusually scattered, with very few transactions. Today, 1,515 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened in the morning, and the market was average. Because major players offered some supply, the market was relatively loose. The initial price was 1,428 yuan. At this time, sellers were numerous. Then it was heard that the opening price for July futures was 1,370 yuan, falling to 1,364.5 yuan at the close, and market sentiment became more weak, and selling pressure increased, and the price fell to 1,417 yuan. However, as prices fell, bullish players re-entered and prices rebounded, and at the same time, the closing price for July futures was 1,375 yuan, and market sentiment revived, rising to 1,434 yuan. After fluctuating around this 30 yuan mark for a long time, the closing price was 1,429 yuan. According to the daily transaction statistics, 9,255 bales were traded. The amount purchased by each firm is listed below: Hong Kong: 1,240; Domestic: 115; Peers: 8,000; Total: 9,255.

### COTTON MARKET TURNAROUND, TRANSACTIONS ALSO IN COARSE COTTON

The spot cotton situation is as calm as ever. Because the market for good foreign cotton continues to rise, although transactions are mediocre, market sentiment is consistently good. However, business in raw materials for coarse yarn is quite good.

Plains Cotton 196 Hongzhang 5.0 pieces sent to the factory

Middling 424 No. 100 pieces delivered to the warehouse

Another 426.75 Another 100 pieces

Fireweed 185 Another 100 bags

Another 1.5 Another 100 bags

Another report: Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai banks, after several days of silence, the cotton market had a slight turnaround yesterday. Factories and peers were both willing to purchase, and were particularly interested in raw materials for fine cotton, so the market was still relatively active. Brazilian cotton for 32-count raw materials was generally priced around 131.30 yuan.

The New York cotton market was active and firm, because the cotton cloth trade was good, and Wall Street strongly rose. As a result, the closing price rose by 13-1.4 pounds.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to bullish players taking profits, but subsequently rebounded due to combined support from buyers and continuous hedging. Yesterday's closing prices rose by half a rupee to three rupees. It is also predicted that the market will open higher today due to the strong rise in New York, expecting to rise by 11 rupees.

Also, from September 1 of last year to May 31 of this year, Indian cotton statistics are recorded below (per bale of 400 pounds):

Bombay: 2,666,000 bales were listed.

1,517,000 bales remain.

Karachi: 1,156,000 bales were listed.

1,033,000 bales were exported.

### SUGAR MARKET: SUGAR FUTURES WEAKNESS REBOUNDS

Yesterday, the sugar market was still weak at first, but then, because bullish players offered less supply and short players covered their profits, prices rebounded. The guild划盘, spot 24 crude white, foreign warehouse April-May arrival only 90.5 yuan to 7 yuan, later March 5 arrival 92 yuan, rising元许, June 10 futures, initial market 91 yuan to 90 yuan and a half, gradually turned tight, for 91.7 yuan, 93.4 yuan, 93.5 yuan, four yuan, five yuan, four yuan, three yuan and four corners, three yuan, three yuan and a half, rising元半, June 20 period opened at 92 yuan, and then rose fully to 92 yuan and a half, three yuan and three corners, four yuan, five yuan, six yuan, five允, four yuan and a half, rising 3 yuan许, Dutch red 70 yuan, small one yuan, Taikoo brand white B唛　warehouse 104 yuan, rising one yuan, HX唛 bundle warehouse 90 yuan.

### MISCELLANEOUS: POPULAR STRAW HATS

The straw hat selling season has arrived. Currently, Panama hats are the most expensive among straw hats, with selling prices ranging from 50 yuan to 100 yuan per hat. The price difference for these goods can be as high as 10 yuan or more for slight differences in thickness and fineness, so buyers must use their own judgment to avoid being fooled by the shop assistants' rhetoric.

Rainproof hats are one of the most popular types in recent years. The fabric comes from Japan, and some are made of paper cloth, which is of poorer quality. The method is to cut them into hat crowns, and the edges of the hat are arched by hand to form the top of the hat, and then sewn together. Both are sprayed with paint on the outside. The paint is waterproof, so it will not change its appearance when exposed to rain, so it is beautifully named a rainproof hat. However, when exposed to the sun, the poor quality ones are prone to cracking. However, because their selling price is still cheap, many people use them. The method of preservation is to wipe off the dirt with a towel cloth when it gets dirty, and avoid pressure, or it can be worn for a longer period of time.

Triangular straw hats and brain-line hats are worn less and less due to the large-scale dumping of rainproof hats. Their selling prices are very cheap, usually only around two yuan is enough.

Taiwan hats are brown in color, and the quality is similar to that of Panama hats, but the selling price is much cheaper, so many people wear them. (Mei)

### LONGEVITY FRUIT (2)

— Li Yuyong

Peanuts are also called Longevity Fruit. The Ganzhou Zhi says, "Ground peanuts" are also called Longevity Fruit, taking the meaning of long vines symbolizing longevity. The English names are Mandubi, Groundnut, Peanut, or Monkeynut, most of which are named after their characteristics. The scientific name is Arachis Hypogeae, and the last word means underground, similar to what we call "ground beans" and "ground fruit." The unique fruiting state of peanuts is very eye-catching. In the West, Bentham's "Flora Brasiliensis" was the first to record it. Li Tiaoyuan's "Notes from South Vietnam" said, "Flowers cannot become vegetables, but pods are separately born between roots and stems. Dig the sand to get them. The shells are about an inch long, wrinkled and twisted; there are three or four seeds inside; like broad beans... The fruits of all plants are formed from flowers; only this one is unique, flowers from flowers, pods from pods, flowers do not produce pods, and pods do not carry flowers, which is also very strange!" In fact, the only difference from other flowers is that the flower stalks elongate and the ovaries develop underground. Yucun's record is exaggerated.

Some people think that the origin of peanuts is Africa, and some people think it is South America. The debate has lasted for a hundred years, and there is still no conclusion. However, most scholars believe in the South American theory. In the eighteenth century, Linnaeus thought it came from Surinam, Brazil, and Peru, but did not say whether it was wild. In 1818, R. Brown's "Flora of the Congo" thought it might have been introduced to India, Ceylon, and Malaya from China, but in all respects, the above-mentioned places do not seem to be the place of origin. Brazil has the earliest records of peanuts, so it is not accurate to say that they came from Africa to South America. Sprengel said that Theopreastus recorded the cultivation of peanuts in Egypt, but he did not know if it was the peanuts we know today. If Egypt really had them today, Forskalls and Deliles would have included them in their catalogs, which seems unreliable. Brown's theory that it was introduced from China to South America and then to Africa cannot be confirmed either.

DeCandolle studied from a linguistic and textual research perspective and believed that it originated in South America. He said: Marcgraff and Piso recorded and painted a common Brazilian plant named Mandubi, which seems to be the place of origin. He also quoted Monardes as saying that it is called Anchic in Peru, and Acosta recorded that it is called Mani in South America. De Candolle said that if peanuts were known to the Egyptians or Arabs early on, the theory that they originated in Africa would also be credible. But Greek, Latin, Arab scholars, and even Forskall, did not record it, so it can be known that the origin was not early. There is also nothing to prove that it originated in Asia. Thurnberg's "Flora Japonica" and Forster's records of the Pacific Islands are all missing. Bretchneider said that there is no peanut name in ancient Chinese books, and even the Compendium of Materia Medica in the sixteenth century does not have it. On the contrary, someone found six species of the same genus in Brazil, and someone found peanut seeds in an ancient tomb of the Ancon Peruvian people, which is enough to provide evidence for the theory that it originated in South America. As for where the wild species of peanuts that are now widely cultivated are, it is questionable. Due to the unique "self-planting" nature of peanuts, if the wild species have been destroyed, it is impossible to have them. Some people say that some in the West Indies have escaped cultivation and returned to the wild. According to DeCandolle's opinion, it was brought to Guinea by slaves in the fifteenth century, and to southern Asia by the Portuguese, so there is a way to get that prosperity.

Or, peanuts were first discovered in Santo Domingo in the West Indies. (During the North American Civil War) the peanut region of Virginia was occupied by the army. After peace, the army brought peanut seeds back as souvenirs, and their propagation spread. Then they were introduced to South America, 香山 to the Mundulas of India, Calcutta, and all the way to Sumatra. The last countries in Europe to cultivate them were Italy and Spain. It is said that their use was first discovered by伯特 (M. Jaubert), a侨民 from得角 (Cape Verd)加里 (Goree). Peanuts were probably imported into our country from the Ming calendar, during the period from 1576 to 1619 AD. (To be continued)

Short Remarks

### Opposite Attitudes

— Jiang Hong

A basic principle of modern children's education is to guide and encourage, rather than to force and suppress. Those responsible for educating children should avoid saying "don't do this and that" and "don't do it this way or that way." It is clever to use more rewarding and praising tones.

The difference between totalitarian countries and democratic countries in their attitude towards the masses today also lies here. The totalitarian government hopes that the masses will cover their ears and close their eyes, only listen to the words of the government spokesperson, not listen to foreign radio broadcasts, not read foreign newspapers and magazines, only allow praise and virtue, and not allow a word of complaint. Democratic countries are not like this. The masses have the freedom of speech, publication, reading books, reading newspapers, and listening to radio broadcasts. In the United States, "reactionaries" like Lindbergh and Wheeler, who are isolationists, are still able to speak publicly. If they were born in a totalitarian country, they would have been sent to a concentration camp long ago if they had not been "beheaded."

The US government's advice to Lindbergh did not exert any pressure, which shows the broad-minded and democratic spirit of a father and brother. From the psychological and educational point of view, this attitude is more correct.

These two opposite attitudes show the spiritual difference between totalitarian countries and democratic countries.

Education

### Myriad Gold Family Letter

— Xiao Zhongna

My son's mother:

Yesterday, a villager brought a letter saying that you had safely arrived home. It is said that your mother is very happy. When she married you off, you were alone, but when you came back, you were dragging two puppies. I hope that my kind mother-in-law is still as happy when she is in the kitchen. Then I will thank God.

Last Sunday, your middle school friends, 徽 and 她們, came to see you. I said that you had returned to your hometown to take care of the children. They stared at me and sighed, "愛麗 has finally been driven into the kitchen." It's as if I am Hitler. In fact, it doesn't matter, isn't there a big shot in our government who also advocates this? Later, they forced me to tell them the reason for your return to your hometown. I told them that because you had too many absences due to your production, you had smashed the sacred chalk rice bowl of this elementary school teacher. With a monthly income of 25 yuan less, our happy little family could not support it, so you had to return to your mother's house. They listened and left sadly, and 徽's eyes were a little wet! Do you think it's funny or not?

Oh, I forgot to tell you one important thing, which is indeed a major event for me. God was merciful, and I don't know how the Ministry of Education issued 140 yuan of relief money, and I received 75 yuan. I am really ashamed and unworthy of it. The 60 yuan debt you owed during production has been paid off, and I plan to put the remaining 15 yuan in the bank as the children's education expenses in the future. Do you agree?

You said when you left that if things don't go well after you return to your hometown, you plan to give the newborn baby to someone else and become a wet nurse yourself. At first, I strongly opposed it, thinking that it would damage our identity; but when I calmed down and thought about it, it didn't matter. Moreover, the spirit of "love my young and extend it to the young of others" is worthy of praise. So I now agree 100%.

Recently, my liver fire has been very strong. Yesterday, I scolded a student during class. He simply blocked me and said, "What are you so arrogant about? My family's driver is much stronger than you!" His reasons were sufficient, and I calmed down for the sake of 7 jiao per hour. I smiled, and they laughed too, so I wrote things like ×＋YXO on the blackboard again, but my hands were a little trembling. You think my progress in forbearance will definitely make you happy, won't it?

How is 阿大? When I see the little brats on the road, I think of him. I accumulate the picture cards of cigarettes one by one, preparing them as teaching materials for him to learn to read pictures. You see, I have fulfilled my duty as a father.

You said that you eat more porridge for three meals a day now. I think porridge is easy to digest and very hygienic. When I see you again, you will probably be fatter.

I wish you happiness always!

Your husband.

### Plainclothes Police

— Huan Jun

Since the police and detectives have significant differences in their duties, plainclothes police cannot be said to be detectives. In various parts of the United States, it is rare to see police officers in uniforms on the streets except for those directing traffic, and plainclothes police officers are responsible for patrolling the streets. Although these police officers do not wear uniforms, they all carry essential items such as pistols and police whistles. When passers-by have disputes or fights, they step forward to perform their duties, show their certificates (each certificate has a photo of the police officer and is numbered), and mediate the matter. If the parties refuse to obey, they will take both parties to the nearest police station for fair handling.

In terms of convenience and efficiency in handling affairs, plainclothes police are indeed better than those in uniform. For example, in the case of ordinary disputes, plainclothes police first observe the progress of the situation without showing any signs of emotion and listen to the main points of the dispute between the two parties, so that they can obtain more accurate confessions in advance; if a major crime such as robbery or murder is taking place on the street, then plainclothes police can arrest the criminal unexpectedly. The thief is often easily captured because he is not prepared. Therefore, after repeated discussions by the US authorities, they unanimously believe that the implementation of plainclothes police is of great benefit to society and is worthy of promotion.

Medicine

### Radium Pills Take Refuge

— Lao Shen

During the London air raids, ensuring the safety of radium pills became the most important issue in the medical community. There were only 18 centimeters of radium pills in the entire United Kingdom, 80% of which were stored in five large hospitals in London. If these rare drugs were unfortunately hit by bombs and destroyed, not only would huge sums of money be turned into nothing, but also thousands of cancer patients would be in an incurable situation. There is also a more dangerous thing, that is, when the radium pills are bombed, they will not turn into ashes; any violent destructive force cannot destroy them. Even if the radium pills are bombed into a cloud of dust, each grain of ash is still a complete radium pill. If this kind of dust is full of air or mixed into public water sources, it can cause terrible harm to the people of the whole city or the whole area. The radioactivity of radium is extremely great, even if it is extremely small, it can wreak havoc in the human body. When radium enters the human body, it quickly accumulates on the bones of the whole body through the spread of blood and tears. From then on, the whole body is like being buried with countless bombs. Every radium atom is a bomb, and it is constantly exploding, exploding... Anyone can easily imagine the most terrible result.

Because of this, every hospital in London that stores radium pills must be careful to build a particularly strong cellar for it, and install very safe and convenient lifting machinery, so that it can be quickly returned to its original place when the alarm suddenly sounds. The volume of radium pills is very small, but it must be sealed in heavy, very thick lead boxes for preservation, because the penetrating power of radium rays is very strong. If it is not blocked by thick metal, there is a danger of leakage and burns to the skin.

The radioactivity of radium is so great that it consumes half of the original amount every 1,700 years. After 35,000 years, it will almost completely turn into lead. Radon is a gas emitted by radium, and its radioactivity is comparable to that of radium. Therefore, hospitals usually collect this gas, seal it in small tubes, and place it deep inside cancer or tumors to replace radium pills for treatment. Radon is much shorter-lived, with only three days and nineteen hours of effective time.

Until recently, all the radium in the world was only two pounds (900 cm), worth 18 million US dollars.

### Two Kinds of People

— Yang Zi

There are two kinds of unfortunate people in the world: one is the "living dead" without inspiration. He has no desires, he has no interest in everything, he does not love his life, but he is extremely afraid of death. The other is the gluttonous "monkey." His desires are endless. He "drills around" all day long, racking his brains, trying his best to "make gimmicks" and "come up with ideas."

There are also two kinds of happy people in the world at the same time: one is full of vitality. He has his own hopes for struggle and immediate success. This hope is also obtained from his daily improvement and hard work. The life of the other kind of person is like a machine, slowly advancing, without disturbing or fantasizing. He can "be content." - Montesquieu.

(8) Perceptible Friendship

"Seventh Master, is there any news from the bank?" Zhao Si suddenly interrupted.

"This is not a problem. My friend just called and told me that they can give you the passbook tomorrow or the day after tomorrow." Then, he turned to Yu Kun and said, "It's good that you're here. Help Zhao Si with his family affairs and rush back to Tianjin together, so that he can feel at ease..."

Yu Kun and Zhao Si were busy answering yes.

"I myself have no face to write to him again." Shao Wen added.

"What are you talking about? Seventh Master, you fell into this place for the sake of Lao San. Even a father wouldn't treat his son like this!" Yu Kun said with a smile.

Zhao Si was wiping the sweat on his face with a towel. Hearing Yu Kun's words, he also nodded repeatedly, expressing his agreement.

Shao Wen smiled slightly and deliberately changed the subject.

Usually, Zhao Si didn't dare to talk much when he saw Shao Wen. At this time, he was covered in sweat, even when he was sitting still, the sweat was still dripping non-stop. Therefore, he didn't say a word and let Yu Kun and Shao Wen talk continuously for dozens of minutes.

When leaving, Shao Wen sent them to the yard.

"Tell Yuqin," he said quietly to Yu Kun alone, "There is one more thing I can't do for him anymore. Persuade him to give up this idea!"

Yu Kun nodded slightly, knowing very well that this referred to Xiang Qi. (124)

### Tree Injections

— Ke Zhong

Since the invention of vaccination, countless people have been saved, which can be said to be the greatest progress in medicine. Recently, some planting experts have also used this knowledge of disease prevention to inject disease-prevention shots into trees. The method is to place a circular container on the trunk of the tree, put the chemical drugs to be used in it, and then drill a hole in the trunk to mix the chemical drugs with the tree sap. It is said that the effect is very good. In addition, there are also those who use this method to treat trees or inject tonics.

### A Record of Impressions of the Enthusiastic China-Supporter Claudette Colbert

— New Shadow

At its peak, the China Relief movement in Hollywood Studios saw child star Shirley Temple salute Chinese children on behalf of American children, followed by superstar Claudette Colbert reading Madame Soong Ching-ling's letters on the radio. This is a noteworthy piece of news; therefore, I am very pleased to introduce Claudette Colbert in all her aspects to the readers of this magazine.

Born in France

When Claudette Colbert is mentioned, perhaps every movie fan knows her. On the screen, she speaks fluent English, but people may not know that she is not American, let alone British, but French! Her parents were also French. In 1913, they moved from France to America. Therefore, her education was entirely in the United States. For this reason, she can speak fluent English, so people wouldn't know she is French, but she also has a considerable foundation in French.

Loves Painting

Often, when she was studying, she did not want to become a movie star in her heart, and her wish was to become an artist, because she has always loved painting. But things sometimes turn out unexpectedly. Once, she met an American star who gave her a supporting role in her play. Just like others, she initially failed, and none of the plays she performed were successful. It wasn't until later that she became famous on the stage, and then moved from the stage to the screen. Good fortune followed.

The Filming Process

Since joining the film industry, Claudette Colbert's first work was with Bing Leong. Then she acted in a second one, but both of these films were complete failures. It wasn't until later, after acting in "Rain," that she became famous. From then on, she rose rapidly, changing from her past depression, and soon became one of Hollywood's leading actresses. Now, for her, it can be said that everyone has a deep impression.

Won a Golden Award

Since then, Claudette Colbert has not only gained fame on the screen, but also her acting skills have improved with time. In a very short period, she has received awards from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences three times. The most noteworthy is in 1933, she and Clark Gable won the award together for starring in "It Happened One Night." As for her private life, unlike other stars, she advocates simplicity and is very enthusiastic about charity on weekdays. But seeing her help China this time also makes me particularly excited!

### Announcement of New Publication

Mr. Xiao Lang's translated "Sketches of Film Stars" is specially featured in this magazine and will be published daily starting next month. The content describes the brief histories of ten of Hollywood's most popular male and female stars. The material is novel, concise, and lighthearted. Please pay attention, readers. (Editor)

### A Collection of Art News

— Wen

To celebrate the eighth anniversary of its establishment, China United Film Company has decided to publicly elect two major films and has entrusted China Film News to collect audience election letters. It is learned that once selected, they have decided to screen them publicly at the Shanghai Guangda Theater.

Yue Feng's new film "Soul Broken at Autumn River," following "Azure Seas and Blue Skies," has been renamed "Imperfect Moon and Faded Flowers" because the original title was not appealing enough. It is also rumored that the film has been decided to star Yuan Meiyun, Gu Yelu, Wang Xianzai, Zhang Wan, Yin Xiucen, Yuan Zhuru, and others.

Li Pingqian's new work "Where the Soul Returns," following "The Merry Widow," has been completely completed. The results of the test screening yesterday showed that Li Hong once again gave an amazing performance in the film.

Chen Yanyan, who was hospitalized for treatment of a heart condition, has recovered and was discharged from the hospital yesterday to recuperate at home. It is said that she will return to the company to cancel her leave within days.

Sun Jing's new work following "The New Invisibility Technique" has been named "Spring River, Flower, Moon, Night." The main cast has also been selected, with Li Lihua, Zheng Chong, Wen Yiming, and others taking on the roles.

Li Qinian's new work, "Thief Beauty," following "The Merry Widow," was once renamed "Snake-like Beauty." Because the title was not stimulating enough, it is said that it has been decided to rename it again to "Romantic Female Thief."

Wang Xichun's first fashion production, "Wartime Jiaoyang," has been completely filmed and will be released at the New Guang Theatre soon. It is said that the story of the film narrates the tragic love history of the famous director Shi Dongshan and his wife Hua Jieni, and the plot is quite vivid.

Diao Banhua, who has been absent from the silver screen for a long time, recently suffered from severe pneumonia. It is said that she was sent to a sanatorium for treatment a week ago.

Since "Golden Capital" changed to exclusively screening "Guolian" second-run new films, it has invited Bian Yuying to be the film scheduling consultant for the theater. The "Golden Capital" authorities specially hosted a banquet at the Jin Gu Hotel to thank Mr. Bian a few days ago.

(Hava News Agency, Beiping, 3rd) The local Xinmin Bao recently published a Tianjin telegram, which briefly stated that the famous actor Ma Lianliang performed his signature play "The Eight Great Hammers" at the Chinese Grand Theater in Tianjin City the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, he made a big mistake on stage. Out of anger, he attempted suicide by jumping into the river in the French Concession that night. Later, he was rescued by concession police officers and sent to the actor's residence in the British Concession. After fourteen hours of rest, he continued to perform at the theater.

Chapter Ten: Gongsun's Sword Aura First

Then Liu Yin and Xu Jing each sat down, and Wang Yongtai also sat beside them to accompany them. Liu Yinying smiled and said: "Today, I unintentionally overheard Brother Jing muttering to himself in the study. Although I don't understand the cause of the incident, I know that you must have something on your mind that you are eager to deal with, so I paid attention to Brother Jing's actions at night. There is a door behind your room that leads to the kitchen. I was watching from there, and sure enough, I saw you quietly going out, about to go down the mountain for a walk. I am naturally curious and like to meddle in other people's affairs, so I immediately took my White Dragon Sword and followed you closely, all the way down the mountain. You climbed over the city wall, and I also climbed in the same way. When you arrived at the mansion of this old hero, I climbed over the wall to enter, and followed you directly to standing in front of the building window, peeking inside." As Liu Yinying said this, Xu Jing slapped his knee and said: "My dear brother's flying skills are several times higher than mine, otherwise how would I not know that someone was following me all the way? I am extremely ashamed." Wang Yongtai also nodded, stroking his beard and smiling. Liu Yinying continued: "At that time, I was young and liked to play tricks, and suddenly wanted to play a game with Brother Jing to test whether you would notice. So I lightly jumped behind you and took the opportunity to draw the Scarlet Phoenix Sword from your back. Later, you noticed and chased after me, so I led you to the back, wanting to ask you what was going on. But unexpectedly, at that time, I caught sight of a black shadow in the east, darting into the wall, which made me curious again. Before I could explain to you, I immediately dropped you and followed the black shadow again. I only saw that the black shadow was looking around, exploring the path. I followed him. He, like Brother Jing, did not realize that someone was behind him. He walked to a courtyard and drifted down. I stood on the roof, silently observing the movement. I saw a light shining through the side room below, knowing that there were people inside. The black shadow peered at the window for a while, then immediately drew a short knife from his waist, seeming to want to go inside and make a move. I guessed that he was a guest who had come here to commit murder. Coincidentally, I had a dart pouch with me, so I took out a poisoned dart and, taking advantage of his unpreparedness, shot a dart at his lower body, hitting his thigh. He shouted 'Ah ya' and immediately fell to the ground. When I jumped down, the old hero Wang had already heard the noise and leaped out from the room." (81)
