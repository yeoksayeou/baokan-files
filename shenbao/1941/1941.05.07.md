### Hitler's Speech Makes No Mention of German-American Relations; This Point is Worth Pondering

Stockholm: An article in the Afghan newspaper here places special emphasis on the fact that Hitler's speech on Sunday made absolutely no mention of German-American relations. It is said that the general public had expected Hitler's speech to contain comments regarding the consequences of the late president's policies, but Hitler made no mention of them, probably because the atmosphere was tense and it was inconvenient to disclose Germany's plans for the United States. Berlin seems willing to continue waiting to observe the results of the internal testing of America's strength.

Rome: Officials here attach great importance to the speech delivered by Führer Hitler yesterday and express deep sympathy and satisfaction. The Italian people particularly welcomed the Führer's praise of the valor of Italian troops. They believe that the Führer's speech echoes the Italian nation's determination to continue fighting alongside Germany. (5th Havas Telegram)

Editorial

### The British-Iraqi War and the International Situation

Britain's having to take military action against Iraq this time is, from a diplomatic standpoint, a failure. Britain fundamentally did not want to use force in this area, first because Iraq's Mosul oil fields and the southern oil-producing regions would inevitably suffer losses in a large-scale military operation, greatly threatening the fuel supply of Britain's Mediterranean and Red Sea fleets. Second, because Iraq's armed forces were entirely equipped and trained by Britain, in the event of war in this area, Britain had always hoped that they could form one wing of its overall military forces, fighting on its side. The current conflict between them is naturally very painful for Britain. Third, because this provides ambitious Germany and Italy with a good excuse to easily expand the war to the Near East, further shaking Britain's foundations. Iraq has always occupied an important position in the united front of Near Eastern and African countries that Britain has long called for to resist German and Italian aggression. Aiden's two inspections last year and this year were generally considered to have strengthened this united front considerably, but unexpectedly, a large-scale battle between Britain and Iraq has now erupted. The reasons for this, as far as can be known at present, are due to unrest within Iraq. The coup not long ago was a concrete illustration of this. As a result, a pro-German and Italian faction seized power, gradually embarking on an anti-British and pro-German path, forcing Britain to quickly use military force to control the situation, firstly because of this. The second reason is due to the fluctuations resulting from the Balkan war. If Britain, Yugoslavia, Greece and Germany and Italy could maintain a long-term standoff in the Balkan war, then this area of the Near East might be temporarily stable; unfortunately, the tide of German and Italian aggression swept through the Balkans, and Iraq's position became the stage for the front-line battle between Britain and Germany and Italy. This intensified their incitement and enticement on the one hand, and deepened Britain's need to immediately establish a front in this area, thus promoting the outbreak of this British-Iraqi conflict, secondly because of this.

Looking at the war situation in recent days and the claims made by Britain, Britain's greatest hope now is to rapidly defeat Iraqi resistance in the shortest possible time, so that Germany and Italy do not have time to extend their power into Iraq through Turkey, or from French Syria, or from Palestine, to avoid expanding the war. If German and Italian forces cannot ultimately unite with the Iraqi army, then the Iraqi army's fate of defeat is sealed. Conversely, if the war expands due to German and Italian participation, then the seriousness of this battle, from Britain's perspective, will exceed the Balkan battle countless times. Strictly speaking, the Near East is Britain's most important line of defense against German and Italian advances on land; in order to maintain India, one of the largest bases of its empire, it will have to do everything possible to defend Iraq, Iran, Arabia, and Afghanistan. However, from the perspective of Germany and Italy, their armies, apart from a land route through Turkey, have no way to pass through Britain's maritime barriers. Aerial support alone cannot help the Iraqi army reverse its obvious decline against Britain. Therefore, Turkey's attitude becomes a decisive factor here.

According to news from Ankara, the reaction in Turkey to the British-Iraqi conflict is mostly dissatisfaction with the Iraqi authorities for starting the war, believing that they are dragging the Near East into the vortex of war. However, tracing the source, Turkey's recent inaction is not only the biggest reason for the recent involvement of the Balkans in the war, but also the outbreak of the current conflict in the Near East is greatly related to Turkey's attitude. If Turkey actively exerts the functions of the British-Turkish alliance and adopts a firm policy towards Germany and Italy, then the large-scale alliance in the Balkans and Near East that Britain has called for would not fall apart, the Balkan battle would not fail so quickly, and the Near Eastern countries that are solely looking to Turkey for guidance would certainly not change suddenly. Furthermore, even from the perspective of Turkey itself, the outbreak of war between Britain and Iraq is an extremely serious matter for Turkey. This major decision will affect the future of its entire country. If German and Italian forces actually control Iraq and establish a foothold in the Near East, then the future Turkey will fall into a three-sided encirclement by Germany and Italy, forcing it to become a protected state, an ally of the Soviet Union. Judging from this point of view, Turkey must do everything possible to reject Germany and Italy's requests to pass through its territory.

The Soviet Union's attitude towards the Near East is certainly very important. It will not only affect the success or failure of both sides in the British-Iraqi war, but also affect Turkey's basic position. According to a telegram from the United States a few days ago, the Soviet Union and Germany have already reached a compromise on dividing the Near East, which is certainly not credible; observing that Germany is still temporarily adopting a wait-and-see attitude after the outbreak of the British-Iraqi war and is not immediately taking action, this is simply waiting for the Soviet Union's reaction to be more clearly understood. But on the other hand, the possibility of Germany and Italy enticing the Soviet Union to reach some kind of compromise certainly exists now. What is particularly worth pointing out here is that if the Soviet Union and Germany once again reach a compromise on dividing the Near East, then the serious consequences will inevitably be twofold: the hope of improving relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will be further reduced; the realization of American participation in the war will probably be imminent.

### American Military Supplies Shipped to China in Steady Stream; Foreign Minister Guo Meets with Hull Again; Speaker Proposes British and American Navies to Cooperate; Blockade Japanese Fleet in the Pacific

Calcutta: President Roosevelt's eldest son, James Roosevelt, passed through here yesterday on his way from Chongqing to Cairo. After arriving in Cairo, James and U.S. Marine Corps Major Thomas will be stationed there as military observers. Their future actions will be at the behest of Washington. James told Reuters reporters that China has received a steady stream of American military supplies, and that the number will increase in the near future. The Chinese people are highly motivated and determined to fight until victory is achieved. He stayed in Chongqing for four days and met with President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife. (6th Reuters Telegram)

Washington: The new Chinese Foreign Minister, Guo Taiqi, again met with U.S. Secretary of State Hull yesterday afternoon for twenty minutes of discussion. This is the second time Guo has held talks with Hull since arriving here. (6th United Press Telegram)

Chongqing: Newspapers here prominently published President Roosevelt's speech on Sunday. *Ta Kung Pao* even headlined the telegram with the large-font title "Roosevelt Says the United States is Ready to Fight at Any Time." *Central Daily News* published an article stating that President Wilson's historic responsibility to uphold justice has now been placed on President Roosevelt's shoulders. The great achievements of great eras in history should be achieved by great figures. President Roosevelt's speech has indicated that he has completed preparations to accomplish a great undertaking. The newspaper also commented on the New Chinese Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi requesting the United States to assist China with more modern aircraft and weapons, saying that Foreign Minister Guo's statement that China will fight until the Japanese withdraw from Chinese territory represents the belief of all Chinese people. If China can obtain the necessary weapons, it will surely be able to win. (6th United Press Telegram)

Washington: Democratic Senator Pepper gave a speech advocating that the British and British navies should openly cooperate in the Pacific to blockade the Japanese fleet and prevent it from going out, because we know that they are waiting for an opportunity to attack. Pepper also said that the United States should supply China with long-range bombers. If China is successful, Tokyo will be a slaughterhouse. If Japan can see in its capital the tragic situation it has created in China, it may slightly reduce its cruel massacres. Pepper also proposed that President Roosevelt should declare a national emergency, and advocated that the United States blockade the exits of Europe, Africa, and Asia to prevent any possible attacks on the American continent, and jointly occupy Greenland, Iceland, the Azores, the Cape Verde Islands, the Canary Islands, Dakar, and Singapore with Britain, so as to maintain the openness of the route to Britain and eliminate the Nazis' attempts to occupy the above-mentioned places. (6th Reuters Telegram)

Tokyo: The *Nichi Nichi Shimbun* published an article by Japanese critic Tokutomi, stating that the United States has now actually joined the war, being dragged down by Britain and sharing the responsibility for defeat. Tokutomi attacked the United States' aid to China, saying that the United States seems determined to shoulder the responsibility of expanding the China Incident and creating a world war. Although the United States says it is fighting for democracy, democracy has become an empty word and no longer exists. (6th Reuters Telegram)

Tokyo: Hōchi Shimbun commentator Yoshiki Muto urged Prime Minister Konoe to contact the United States to stop aiding China. Muto attacked Foreign Minister Matsuoka for taking no action. Muto said that the United States is now in a position to fight Germany, so if Japan contacts them in an appropriate way, the United States may abandon aiding China, or even fundamentally resolve the conflicts. Matsuoka must know that this is a god-given opportunity, and what is he doing by taking no action? However, Muto's article did not mention what Japan would do if the United States and Germany went to war. This is believed to be an important issue. (6th United Press Telegram)

### Roosevelt and Hull Decide Not to Visit Japan; U.S. Senator Advocates Limiting Japan to Leave Axis Powers, Otherwise They Will Taste the War of the United States

Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday at his weekly press briefing that if the Japanese government invites him or President Roosevelt to visit Japan, they will refuse the invitation. Hull indicated that he had not seriously considered Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's suggestion that he and the President visit Japan to understand Japan's goals in the Pacific. Hull said that the United States has not received any formal invitation, and even if it did, it would refuse it. At that time, a reporter said that it was rumored that the Japanese embassy had notified the State Department that further restrictions on oil exports to Japan would have serious consequences, and asked if he had heard of this rumor. Hull did not comment, only saying that he did not know much about it. However, Hull stated that the U.S. government had cancelled all permits for unshipped scrap iron to Japan and Japanese-occupied areas in China, and said that this action was at the request of defense officials, because according to defense officials, many exported rubber products were being transferred to Germany to replenish that country's shortages. (6th United Press Telegram)

Washington: Representative Rice (Democrat, Arkansas) said on the House floor yesterday that Japan should be given a week to leave the Axis powers, or they will taste the war of the United States. "If Japan rejects this proposal, I will follow the example of the gentleman and prepare to erase Japan from the map." (6th United Press Telegram)

Washington: Japanese sources have proposed that Japan and the United States should hold negotiations to resolve outstanding issues in the Pacific. Political figures here have expressed a lukewarm response, saying that the United States' attitude has been clearly stated repeatedly and there is no need to say more. In addition, the suggestion in Japanese newspapers that Foreign Minister Matsuoka invite the United States is not worth mentioning. As for Japan's hope that the U.S. authorities will invite their country, it is absolutely impossible. (5th Havas Telegram)

### Mr. Vinson's Statement: Supporting Implementation of Escort, U.S. President Orders Expediting of Bombers So That Democratic Nations May Obtain Air Supremacy

Washington: Mr. Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, stated yesterday that he supported the United States implementing escorting. Mr. Vinson said that he supported the United States commencing escorting "today." When interviewed by reporters, he stated, "If Britain must obtain raw materials, then I support implementing escorting." It is noted that the House Naval Affairs Committee usually reflects the government's views on the Navy, but he did not indicate that he had discussed the escorting matter with government leaders. Representative Cox, a Democrat from Georgia, predicted, "We are about to escort, and will escort immediately." Representative Fish, a Republican from New York, opposed the bill to requisition ships. He believed that if this bill were passed without amendment, it would be tantamount to a "declaration of war," and he denounced every member of the President's cabinet as an interventionist, who for the past year and a half had been trying to drag the United States into war. (United Press, 6th)

Washington: The House of Representatives met today to discuss the bill authorizing the government to requisition foreign merchant ships docked in American ports. Representative Cox, a Democrat from Georgia, argued that the United States should implement fleet escorting to supply Britain with military goods. He stated, in part, "It is self-evident that we should immediately implement escorting. Since we have decided to lend Britain tens of millions of dollars for military needs and have promised to do our best to assist them, if we do not implement escorting, we cannot fulfill our promise. If escorting is sufficient to draw us into the vortex of war, and we therefore avoid taking it, it is absolutely unreasonable." (Havas, 5th)

New York: Secretary of War Stimson, Colonel, is expected to deliver an important radio address tonight. Well-informed sources believe that he will advocate using the U.S. Navy to transport military supplies to Britain, and will warn Germany that the United States will not flinch and will not allow its munitions to be sunk in the Atlantic. (Reuters, 6th)

New York: Seventeen political and military experts declared yesterday that the assertion that "Britain has already been defeated and is beyond salvation" (Editor's note: this is presumably aimed at Lindbergh's defeatist argument) is groundless. The experts jointly declared that the necessary condition for Britain's final victory is to maintain uninterrupted shipping in the Atlantic. The U.S. Navy and Air Force already possess striking power, which is the same as in 1917, sufficient to balance or exceed the combat power on the escort routes. Signatories to this declaration included Admiral Pratt and Standley (both former Chiefs of Naval Operations), Vice Admiral Rodgers and Rear Admiral Yarnell (former Commander of the Asiatic Fleet), etc. They listed eight reasons, and the conclusion was that Britain will definitely not be defeated, and even if this were true, the United States must do its utmost to delay Hitler's victory and make him pay a huge price. (United Press, 6th)

Washington: President Roosevelt sent a letter to Secretary of War Stimson, instructing him to find ways to greatly increase the actual quantity of heavy bombers, saying that democratic nations must gain control of the skies. The air power of democratic nations is comparatively increasing monthly, and we must accelerate it to place the air superiority of democratic nations in an absolute position. According to the Production Administration, American aircraft factories delivered a total of 1,427 military aircraft in April, an increase of 211 percent compared to March. The types were not disclosed, and officials would not announce how many aircraft were shipped to Britain. (Reuters, 6th)

### Dutch Foreign Minister and Colonial Minister Will Accompany Tour of Australia and New Zealand, East Indies Intensifying Defense Preparations, If Attacked, United States Will Inevitably Assist

Batavia: Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens and Colonial Minister Welter will spend six days in Australia from May 12 to 18, then visit New Zealand, and fly to San Francisco on May 24. (Reuters, 6th)

Batavia: Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens and Colonial Minister Welter will spend six days in Australia from May 12 to 18, then visit New Zealand, and fly to San Francisco on May 24. (Reuters, 6th)

Batavia: Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens yesterday expressed his attitude towards the Dutch East Indies being attacked, saying that if the Dutch East Indies is attacked, the United States will step in to assist. Kleffens' words were the most urgent public statement made by any official to the people of the Dutch East Indies. He also referenced his meeting with British Far East Commander-in-Chief General Brooke-Popham in Manila to support his statement. It is said that "our position cannot be regarded as separated from the land of other countries, because geographically the Dutch East Indies are connected with other countries. A few days ago, General Brooke-Popham pointed out at a press conference, "Whether politically or militarily, the line from Singapore through the Dutch East Indies to Australia must be regarded as a single unit, so if there is foreign aggression attacking any part of this line, it will affect the whole, and at the same time, the whole will feel the threat of attack. It is also well known to us that the United States will assist other countries struggling to resist aggression." (United Press, 6th)

Batavia: Although the tension in the Dutch East Indies seems to have eased somewhat, military preparations for defense are still proceeding at the highest speed. In the past few days, the Dutch have often felt that the god of war is about to arrive. When housewives go out shopping, their cars often have to stop in the street to wait for fully armed soldiers marching in formation to pass. All men aged 18 to 46 must register to serve the government in wartime. If they are unable to serve in the military, they can still take on many other jobs, and everyone must do some work while continuing their careers. Reservists must serve in the army for one week each month. Supplemental members of the municipal guard must report to the old racecourse in Batavia three times a week for training, using the entire afternoon. The financial budget of the Dutch East Indies is very heavily burdened due to the implementation of a vast new military buildup plan. Dutch women are also participating in wartime preparations. Women's organizations such as women's auxiliary teams and air defense teams have taken up most of the time of Dutch women, and driving military ambulances and caring for children during urban evacuations are all part of the work of Dutch women. Air defense teams are now working hard to prepare the Dutch East Indies to cope with air raids in the event of war. Air raid shelters have been built everywhere, and in Batavia alone, they can accommodate more than 20,000 people. On the streets of Batavia, young people wearing gas masks march in formation every day, and they are part of the air defense reserve. The food problem in the Dutch East Indies is not expected to be serious. (United Press, 6th)

### U.S. High-Speed Aircraft Publicly Demonstrated, 30,000 Viewers

Los Angeles: The Lockheed XP-38 was publicly demonstrated for the first time yesterday, with 30,000 viewers. Its speed was so high that viewers had not yet heard the sound of the aircraft before it had disappeared from sight. It is said to be able to ascend in a straight line and reach a speed of 300 miles per hour. In level flight, with the engine at three-quarters power, it can fly at 460 miles per hour. The aircraft has four to six rapid-firing machine guns and large machine guns. (United Press, 6th)

On the day the ship left Lisbon, he saw a Portuguese ship carrying 3,000 soldiers depart, ostensibly bound for the Azores. He knew that a team of soldiers had already been sent to the island a few days earlier. (Reuters, 6th)

### Turkish Mediation Proposal Rejected by Both Britain and Iraq, British Government Sets Preconditions for Negotiation, Egypt Also Appeals to Iraq to Cease Fire

London: Reliable sources here stated yesterday that the Turkish government had made a tentative effort to mediate the Anglo-Iraqi conflict. It is believed that Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu conveyed this intention to the British Ambassador to Turkey at the end of the week after consulting with the Iraqi, Iranian, and Afghan envoys in Ankara. However, observers here said that Britain does not trust Iraqi Prime Minister Al-Gaylani, so it may not be possible to accept mediation. (United Press, 6th)

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the Turkish government has proposed to the British government that it is willing to mediate the dispute between Britain and Iraq. The British government expressed deep gratitude for the Turkish government's friendly intentions, but felt that the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Habbaniya was a necessary precondition for any negotiations. (Reuters, 6th)

Istanbul: Yesterday, it was officially announced that Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu was willing to act as mediator in the Anglo-Iraqi dispute. The Turkish Foreign Ministry has been very busy with this matter in recent days. Observers believe that any agreement reached by Iraq must be conditional on the non-stationing of British troops in Iraqi territory. This condition is inevitably harsh, and at the same time, Britain will certainly find it difficult to abandon its lines of communication to Turkey and Palestine. (United Press, 6th)

London: A Cairo dispatch last night stated that the Egyptian Prime Minister's residence issued a statement saying that the Egyptian government had decided to write to the Iraqi government, stating, in part, "Egypt is emotionally and fraternally linked to Iraq, and earnestly hopes that the causes of the Anglo-Iraqi conflict can be eliminated immediately, and that their inherent good relations can be restored immediately. Iraq should be aware of its serious responsibilities, especially in the current critical environment. We urgently hope that both sides will establish a satisfactory solution to the existing disputes, so as to restore peace to Iraq and avoid the spread of war." (Reuters, 6th)

Beirut: According to a report received here at noon yesterday, the Turkish Ambassador to Iraq expressed his desire to mediate the Anglo-Iraqi war, but was rejected by Iraq. The Iraqi government stated that Britain's attitude made peace talks impossible, and that negotiations could not be conducted unless British troops left Iraqi territory. (Haitong, 6th)

Nanjing: The shortwave radio station of the newspaper officially stated this morning that Arab troops from Transjordan have now joined the Iraqi army in fighting. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

Beirut: It was learned here this morning that Egypt's proposal to mediate the Anglo-Iraqi conflict was rejected yesterday by the Iraqi government for the same reasons as it rejected Turkey's proposal. (Haitong, 6th)

### Intense Fighting Between British and Iraqi Forces Around Habbaniya Airfield

### Nazis Exerting Pressure on France, Attempting to Pass Through Syria to Aid Iraq

London: British commentators attach great importance to the seriousness of the Iraq war, and today have shifted their attention to Syria. They fear that Germany is very likely to pass through Syria to land and then aid Iraq in resisting Britain. British observers believe that the talks between French Associate Darlan and German Ambassador Abetz in Paris may contain a German request to allow it to establish military and air bases in Syria to attack British forces in Iraq and increase its threat to Egypt. Some believe that Germany's infiltration of Syria may be carried out through the German Armistice Commission. Commentators in the press here strongly argue that due to Germany's active propaganda activities in Syria, Palestine, and Iran, Britain is required to achieve victory in Iraq as soon as possible and consolidate its position on the Libyan border. One commentator advised, "If we cannot accomplish these two things, then we will have many difficulties." Military experts estimate that the Iraqi army is between 30,000 and 50,000 men, and are confident that British forces can cope with the Iraqi army, especially since they are currently fighting in the small area of ​​Habbaniya, but they express concern for fear of new wars occurring and expanding the front. Well-informed political circles are discussing Turkey's offer to mediate the Anglo-Iraqi dispute, and it is said that Britain's demand for Iraqi troops to withdraw from the Habbaniya area means that this move can provide a way to study whether it is possible to negotiate their differences. The "Daily News" diplomatic reporter, Ivor, reported that this mediation proposal was put forward before the outbreak of war. Responsible American figures here pointed out that the development of the Iraqi situation may require the United States to supply a larger amount of oil to British forces in the Middle East via the Red Sea. They stated that American oil is readily available, but American tankers are very scarce. (United Press, 5th)

### Miracle of Dr. Weidan's Medical Skill

Dr. Weidan's miraculous skill, known as "Nasal Membrane Contact," cures difficult and complicated diseases every day. The number of Chinese patients seeking treatment constantly increases on the Bund road of the Cathay Hotel, which is enough to show the effectiveness of his skill.

Those who suffer from asthma recover after Dr. Weidan's treatment, returning to youthfulness. Some who have suffered from this terrible disease for many years lose their disease after several treatments by Dr. Weidan, and they cannot help but marvel at its miraculousness.

Dr. Weidan once said to someone, "My technique is not just a temporary relief from asthma. In fact, it has the momentum of eradicating the root of the problem. The vast majority of patients will never have to worry about recurrence after being cured."

"I have studied this disease for fifteen years. Based on this experience, I know deeply that after the nerve endings of the nasal spot membrane are contacted by my technique, any abnormal nerves that cause asthma will be stimulated by me to return to normal, and the disease of asthma will then also be cured."

"To this day, I dare to say that if 100 asthma patients seek medical treatment, 80 of them will be completely cured or have their symptoms greatly reduced. Even recurrent and unstable coughs and chronic bronchitis can be effectively treated with my technique, making patients healthier." There are also many cases of nervous system diseases that have been cured by Dr. Weidan's miraculous skill. One patient had been unconscious for four years, and one hand and one foot on the right side of his body could not move and felt tremors. He also had difficulty speaking. When the patient first sought treatment, he needed family support, but after six treatments by Dr. Weidan, he was able to move on his own, and the tremors were greatly reduced. Dr. Weidan said that he would be like a normal person in a few months. Another patient suffered from stomach pain so severely that he had to strictly diet. After the first treatment, the pain disappeared as if it had never been there.

Dr. Weidan's treatment of nervous system diseases is also extremely rapid. He recently cured two patients with epilepsy, especially demonstrating miraculous achievements. Everyone knows the tragic state of this disease. Patients, whether children or young people, appear to be healthy, but suddenly lose consciousness, fall to the ground, and tremble all over. It was previously thought to be an incurable disease, but now it can be treated with the technique of "Nasal Membrane Contact." Dr. Weidan has cured more than 30 cases of this disease in Vietnam.

The new technique of "Nasal Membrane Contact" also has significant efficacy in treating children with delayed physical and mental development. Lazy children are actually sick children and should not be scolded, but should be treated quickly so that their reason and courage can be developed.

Dr. Weidan diagnoses and treats various diseases without the aid of medicine. He simply uses a small metal rod to contact the various nerve points on the nasal mucous membrane. The miraculousness of his technique is even more amazing. However, it is largely the same as our ancient Chinese acupuncture method. The difference is that our method inserts gold needles into all parts of the body, while Dr. Weidan only contacts the nasal membrane.

In fact, the principles of the two methods are the same, both recognizing that our health depends on the normal function of the sympathetic nervous system.

Whether it is our ancient Chinese method or Dr. Weidan's new method, both stimulate and excite the starting points of various nerves to achieve the effect of treating diseases. It is deeply believed that future medicine will rely even more on this technique, as it can directly reach the causes of various diseases. Dr. Weidan aims to promote his miraculous skills around the world. He has traveled extensively in South America, Madagascar, Vietnam, and other places, diagnosing and treating various diseases with great efficacy. He originally intended to make a short stop in Shanghai, but because the number of patients seeking treatment increased day by day, he could not refuse and is planning to stay in Shanghai for a year. Those who suffer from the above-mentioned diseases and wish to inquire may go to Room 707 of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day (except Saturday afternoons and Sundays). Do not hesitate and miss the opportunity.

### British Planes Night Raid Brest; Two German Warships Heavily Damaged; Large Number of Armor-Piercing Bombs Dropped Hit Targets; German Planes Continue Extensive Raids on England

London. The Air Ministry information office stated that on Sunday night, the British Air Force flew a large number of armor-piercing bombs to Brest and dropped them on the Nazi battlecruisers "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau." These two ships entered the port at the end of March to refuel and resupply ammunition. It only required 24 hours to complete, but the two ships have been moored in the port for more than five weeks, which indicates that they may have discovered significant damage at sea or were damaged by bombing in Brest. When the British planes raided on Sunday night, the moonlight was bright and the British airmen clearly saw the two ships and dropped huge bombs that hit the targets. The dry docks and wharves where they were berthed were also heavily bombed. On Sunday night, the German air force attacked England, mainly targeting Northern Ireland and the northwest of England. The Millsea Kid area has been attacked for the fourth consecutive night. At least eight German bombers were shot down by British fighters and anti-aircraft guns. (Reuter's dispatch, 6th)

In the continuous moonlit night battles, seven German planes were destroyed. Although the area of the air raids was at least seven places, none were as severely damaged as Millsea Setter, Belfast, and Plymouth. According to the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Domestic Security’s public announcement, the first to bear the brunt was Crete Satter, where the losses and casualties were very heavy, including several medical and emergency personnel, and air defense team members suffered the most damage. In one city, one emergency station was hit by two bombs, and one air-raid shelter was directly hit, resulting in numerous casualties. Several small fires were bravely extinguished by volunteer firefighters, fortunately preventing them from spreading. Rescue workers also worked hard in the rain of bullets, saving countless lives. German planes bombed Millsea Setter with less regularity, but the losses there were quite large. It is said that seven German planes were shot down by British night fighters. The German attack on central Scotland was the most intense in weeks, and bombs also fell on western Scotland. Both areas resisted the German planes with fierce anti-aircraft fire. Millsea Setter was effectively raided by German planes for the fifth night, but it was lighter than the previous few times. Various parts of England, especially the eastern, northeastern, and southwestern parts of England, were also bombed, but they were not concentrated attacks, so the areas affected were not extensive. A short air raid alarm was also issued in London, but it was not attacked. In addition, the Public Security Bureau of Belfast and the British Air Force Command issued a joint public announcement stating that a small number of enemy planes attacked Belfast and other areas of Northern Ireland this morning. One enemy plane was hit by our plane, caught fire, and fell into the sea. The enemy planes dropped many high-explosive bombs, causing some casualties, but it is believed that they were lighter than the last time. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

Tragic Scene in a Major Northern Irish City After Bombing

As with the first major bombing on April 15, it is comforting that the number of deaths and injuries is not as high as initially feared. However, the public announcement stated, "Many industrial, commercial and residential buildings were damaged." A certain hospital that was hit by a bomb last time caught fire again on Sunday night. Nurses quickly moved the patients (mostly women and children) to safety. Firefighters and rescue teams worked all night. Civilians whose homes were destroyed did not complain.

Manila. Philippine President Quezon today requested Congress to approve an allocation of 10 million pesos for national defense, and asked to expand the emergency power law. Quezon forcefully stated that protecting the Philippines from aggression is the actual responsibility of the United States, but the affairs of the Philippine people to prevent famine, epidemics, illegal actions, and other war dangers should be the responsibility of the Philippines. The funds that President Quezon requested from Congress are intended to make the Philippines' food supply self-sufficient, and to handle storage, major imports, and ensure sufficient storage of medicines. These funds will also be used to design various plans for the evacuation, residence, diet, and construction of essential transportation for residents, and to organize civilian groups. The plan for these plans has been approved by the US authorities. The Philippine Daily News stated that the Philippine parliament is likely to pass a bill authorizing President Quezon to negotiate a loan of 400 million pesos with the US Export-Import Bank for the US and the Philippines to conduct trade and exchange goods to avoid the danger of the Philippine economy collapsing due to the impact of the European war. The newspaper also stated that this fund is obviously used to offset the adverse results caused by the export of new Philippine raw materials such as coconuts, coconut oil, iron, manganese, and chromium. It is said that Japan has recently become the largest customer of Philippine coconuts and coconut oil, and it is generally suspected that these items are transshipped to Germany via the Soviet Union, and most of the iron in the Philippines is also shipped to Japan.

The steps taken by the United States to increase aid to Britain last week must have shocked the German side. (Reuter's dispatch, 6th)

### Two Yugoslav Ships Under Surveillance by the United States

New York. The New York American News recently stated that two Yugoslav ships have been taken over, one of which attempted to sail out but was intercepted outside Staten Island in New York Harbor. The US Coast Guard stated yesterday that coast guard soldiers are monitoring all Yugoslav ships in the Rokerlin area of New York. This is a precautionary measure, not a takeover. The reason for this move is to determine whether the crew members are loyal to the Yugoslav King and are tending towards the new government established in Yugoslavia. According to the results of the investigation, the crew members of these two ships support their King and Britain, so the authorities have no further action against them, but they are still closely monitored. It is reported that there are seventeen Yugoslav ships currently in various US ports. (Reuter's dispatch, 6th)

### Hong Kong Rice Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai on the 12th, to Be Available for Sale in Mid-Month; Market Prices Plunged Yesterday Due to Pre-Sales; Rice Weevils Still Attempting a Final Struggle; Shanghai Municipal Council Announced Detailed Measures for Selling Hong Kong Rice Yesterday

The first batch of 50,000 bags (i.e., 5,000 tons) of low-priced rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council, totaling 62,500 shi, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 12th of this month. It will be distributed to various retail rice shops for sale. The police department will distribute sales vouchers to the areas under the jurisdiction of each police station. After the vouchers are filled out by the retail rice shops, they will be collected by the police and then submitted to the Liki Yanghang for distribution according to the vouchers. It is said that sales will begin on the 15th. The French Concession authorities also summoned the heads of the rice trade association yesterday to discuss the distribution of tribute rice after it arrives in Shanghai and the joint steps that should be taken with the Public Concession.

Measures for Sale

The Shanghai Municipal Council announced the regulations for selling the Municipal Council's imported rice yesterday: (1) This imported rice is sold retail to the public in Shanghai, and its price must not exceed the maximum price set by the Municipal Council at the time of sale. Retailers must always display the retail price of the rice in a prominent place in their stores. (2) This rice can only be sold to consumers and cannot be used for resale. (3) Retailers must sell this rice during regular business hours and when the public needs it. (4) Retailers must sell the rice in its original form and must not mix it with other types of rice. (5) Retailers should always keep a sufficient quantity of imported rice supplied by the Municipal Council to meet the needs of their customers. (6) If any of the above agreements are violated, the retailer's business license will be revoked and they will be prosecuted according to law.

Weight and Price

The form for applying to sell the Municipal Council's imported rice (special-grade Yangon small-grained rice) is as follows: (1) Store name and license number; (2) Address and telephone number; (3) Date the applicant started business; (4) Average monthly rice sales in 1940; (5) The quantity of imported rice requested for supply when it arrives in Shanghai on May 12. Each bag weighs 224 pounds when it leaves the wharf and is priced at 133.50 national currency per bag. (6) The applicant is willing to sell the rice retail to the public at a price not exceeding 110 yuan per shi, with each shi weighing 80 kilograms. (7) The applicant is willing to comply with the above regulations and sell the imported rice purchased by the Municipal Council this time and in the future. (8) Date, signature, and seal of the store owner. (9) Note: This application form should be completed and submitted immediately to Liki Yanghang at 220 Sichuan Road.

Association Orders

The reporter also learned from Liki Yanghang yesterday: (1) Grain shops and rice shops must pay a 30% deposit when ordering the low-priced Hong Kong rice from the Yanghang, and the balance must be paid upon delivery. (2) Rice shops must pay the full amount upon delivery. (3) Several members of the Grain Association continued to order low-priced rice from the Yanghang yesterday, totaling more than 20,000 bags. (4) Many public organizations and schools in the city continued to apply to the Yanghang to purchase rice yesterday. The person in charge of the Yanghang politely asked them to purchase it from nearby rice shops. Regarding this matter, the Information Office of the Municipal Council issued a public announcement stating that if there are any inquiries about the rice shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai by the Bureau, please contact Liki Yanghang at 220 Sichuan Road directly. The telephone number of the Yanghang is 19217.

Free Purchase

The rice weevils have recently repeatedly fabricated rumors to undermine the low-priced Hong Kong rice, claiming that (1) this low-priced Hong Kong rice is similar to low-priced broken rice, (2) people must line up to purchase this Hong Kong rice, and (3) the quantity that can be purchased will be limited. After investigation by the reporter yesterday, this is absolutely not the case. These rumors have other purposes. The responsible party also solemnly declared that (1) the quality of this low-priced Hong Kong rice is exactly the same as the 40-grain small-grained rice currently sold on the market (the reporter noted that the market price of this small-grained rice yesterday was more than 130 yuan per shi), and is by no means comparable to low-priced broken rice. (2) Residents can purchase it from any legitimate rice shop at any time and place, and there are no restrictions on time, location, or number of people. (3) There will be no restrictions on the long-term supply to legitimate rice merchants who apply to sell it.

French Concession Consultations

In order to stabilize the people's food supply and take the same steps as the Public Concession, Mr. Sarraut, the Director-General of the French Concession Municipal Council, specially summoned Mr. Zhang Nianxuan and Mr. Qu Zhenhua, the persons in charge of the city's rice trade association, at 9:30 yesterday morning to discuss the specific distribution measures after the tribute rice arrives in Shanghai. The results of the consultation were: (1) The price of tribute rice will also be set at 110 yuan. (2) The distribution measures will be carefully implemented with reference to the regulations of the Public Concession. (3) Rice merchants who sell rice must mark the price, weight, quality, etc. in both Chinese and French. If there is any discrepancy, buyers can file a complaint with the Municipal Council and be punished. It is heard that the rice trade association is extremely supportive of this wise measure by the authorities, as it not only benefits the citizens but also allows the rice trade to operate under normal circumstances.

Rice Weevils Panicked

After the rice market opened as usual yesterday, a small number of rice weevils were still spreading rumors in the market in an attempt to raise prices, but because a certain grain shop had already ordered low-priced Hong Kong rice from the Municipal Council and sold it to rice shops at the legal price stipulated by the authorities, the rice weevils were all panicked, and the price of rice fell sharply by six or seven yuan. It is expected that when the Municipal Council's low-priced rice arrives in Shanghai, the prices of various illegal rice grains will no longer exist.

Cart Workers Petition

There are no fewer than 1,000 rubber-wheeled cart workers in the city who transport rice. Before the war, all the rice of the rice shops was transported by these people. Since the war, the price of rice has gradually soared, and ordinary poor people have repeatedly engaged in looting. Therefore, the rice shops have gradually switched to using motor vehicles for transportation in order to reduce losses. In the end, all the rice was transported by trucks, which put the livelihoods of the rice cart workers in dire straits. Therefore, they jointly sent letters to rice shops and the rice trade association, asking them to take into account the facts and the environment and continue to entrust the rice to be transported by carts within the possible scope in order to maintain their livelihoods. However, negotiations have been going on for more than a month, and the workers are suffering from hunger and cold. Therefore, they have decided to petition the Municipal Council and the rice trade association for relief within a few days in order to promote an early resolution of the dispute. At the same time, they appeal to all sectors of society for sympathy and assistance.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Public Utilities Committee to Convene Meeting Tomorrow; Several Cases Related to Citizens' Lives to Be Decided by the Committee

According to informed sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Utilities Committee will convene a meeting tomorrow (the 8th). Several cases that have a serious impact on citizens' lives will be decided. It is heard that the items to be discussed at that time include the public bus company's proposal to increase fares by 100%, the price increase proposals of the Shanghai Tramway Company and the Waterworks Company, and the proposal of the Electricity Conservation Committee to reduce industrial electricity consumption by 50%. It is expected that all members of the committee will attend at that time, and Mr. Mitchell will preside over the meeting. After detailed discussions on each case, they will be submitted to the highest administrative organ of the Municipal Council for final decision before implementation. Currently, citizens throughout the city are paying close attention to tomorrow's meeting, and it is hoped that the members of the committee can appreciate the hardship of citizens' lives and give the strictest consideration to each proposal, as if all these proposals are passed, the citizens' livelihoods will be under even greater pressure.

Financial Situation of the Electric Power Company

Mr. Hawkins, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Public Concession Electric Power Company, told reporters yesterday that since 1938, the income of the Electric Power Company has increased by 345%, while its expenses have increased by 635%. He pointed out that the electricity bills paid by ordinary residential users are now 210% higher than in 1938, while those paid by large users are 471% higher. However, the other expenses of ordinary residents in Shanghai are definitely not just this percentage compared to 1938. He pointed out that the Municipal Council's Chinese living index shows an increase of 664%, while the price of fuel used by the Yangshupu Electric Power Plant of the Electric Power Company has increased by 1,321% and will soon increase to 2,800%. Even the price of yellow sand used by the electric power plant has increased by 538%. Mr. Hawkins said that the electricity rates in the Shanghai Public Concession are lower than in any other city in the world except for the French Concession in this city. Mr. Hawkins continued that on July 31, 1937, the financial situation of the Electric Power Company was very good. At that time, the company had more than US$2,990,000 and 3,300,000 national currency in cash in the bank. However, since the Sino-Japanese War, costs have increased and expenses have increased, and the company has been further affected by the devaluation of the national currency. At the same time, the so-called exchange surcharge approved by the Municipal Council was only 32.5% in 1938, and after the end of July 1939, it had to be increased again, but even now it is only 180.97%. Mr. Hawkins finally said that the Electric Power Company has made great contributions to the prosperity of this city, but if the income cannot cover the expenses and the difference is too large, the future of the electric power industry in this city is worrying. He said that the Electric Power Company must have a reasonable surplus. He pointed out that if the company had not had a surplus before 1937, how could it have had the current large-scale electric power plant, which, based on the current national currency, is worth more than 80 million yuan, while its value at that time was only 20 million yuan. He pointed out that although the Electric Power Company had a surplus in the past, the direct beneficiaries were still the majority of electricity users.

### First Parents' Day Approaching Soon; All Sectors Enthusiastically Celebrating; Held on the Second Sunday of May Each Year; Promoting Filial Piety and Parents' Education

The second Sunday of May is American Mother's Day. The Christian Family Movement Committee of the National Council of Churches in China, in view of the close relationship between parents and children and the nation and people, in order to promote filial piety, improve the welfare of parents, and promote parental education, has specially decided to adopt and expand the good intentions of American Mother's Day. It has sent letters to national Christian churches, Christian organizations, and church schools, etc., to hold Parents' Day on the second Sunday of May each year, and since its inception, it has been deeply supported by all parties. Now, the first Parents' Day is approaching soon, and all sectors of Shanghai will have enthusiastic celebrations at that time in order to promote filial piety. A special exploration of the various aspects is recorded as follows:

History

In 1917 of the Western calendar, the United States joined the First European War. Soldiers going to war crossed the ocean to defend foreign lands, and it was inevitable that they would feel homesick. The military chaplain stipulated that the second Sunday of May each year would be Mother's Day. In addition to holding religious ceremonies to pay tribute to mothers, he also created "Mother's Day Song on the Battlefield" for the entire army to sing in order to dispel the soldiers' sorrows and boost their fighting spirit. After the end of the European War, the American society, in view of the profound meaning of Mother's Day, still held a cessation of mourning every year. On Mother's Day, both men and women wore a rose flower. Those with mothers wore red flowers, and those without mothers wore white flowers. Children whose mothers were alive had to present gifts to show their love. Those who had passed away would offer flowers on the grave to show their deep sorrow.

Date

The date of Parents' Day is the second Sunday of May each year, so the first Parents' Day this year is May 11. The purpose of holding Parents' Day is threefold: (1) to promote filial piety, (2) to improve the welfare of parents, and (3) to promote parental education.

Measures

The new method of holding Parents' Day is carried out in three aspects: A. Regarding the individual aspect: (1) Wear flowers to express love and commemorate parents.

(3) Hold banquets for parents to celebrate their health. (4) Invite parents to participate in entertainment venues to increase their happiness. (5) Send flowers to parents who are sick to express their condolences. (6) Send letters to parents in distant places to inquire about their well-being. (7) If parents are deceased, offer flowers on the grave to express deep sorrow. (8) If parents are deceased and brothers and sisters have already separated, they should live together for one day to recall the past and express their commemoration of their parents. (9) Relieve poor and helpless parents. (10) Assist parents who are in difficulty. B. Regarding various schools (kindergartens, elementary schools, middle schools, universities, etc.) and child welfare institutions (orphanages, refugee training centers, etc.): (1) Hold a homesickness meeting. (2) Hold a thanksgiving meeting. (3) Hold a lecture on parent-child relationships. (4) Hold a research meeting on parent-child relationships. (5) Hold an essay contest on filial piety (such as My Parents, My Father, My Mother, etc.). (6) Hold a speech contest on filial piety. (7) Assist poor and helpless parents. (8) Assist parents who are in difficulty. C. Regarding social education institutions (public education centers, youth associations, church organizations, etc.): (1) Hold a Parents' Day celebration. (2) Hold a Parents and Daughters reunion. (3) Hold a Parents' Education lecture. (4) Show a Parents' Education movie. (5) Hold a Parents' Problem symposium. (6) Hold a Parents' Story or Drama performance. (7) Hold a Parents' Association. (8) Hold a Father's Association. (9) Hold a Mother's Association. (10) Commend virtuous parents. (11) Relieve poor and helpless parents. (12) Assist parents who are in difficulty. (13) All churches of the Chinese Christian Church can hold Parents' Day worship and give lectures on parent education issues.

Songs

Mr. Rood of the United States specially wrote two Mother's Day Songs on the Battlefield to commemorate Mother's Day. The detailed lyrics are as follows: (1) On the battlefield, preparing to attack, Mother, I miss you. The two armies face each other from afar, and they are about to fight. My brothers in the same team are all around me, full of blood and determination. As long as there is still a breath, I will work hard to fight until death before I can unload my shoulders. Mother, I will never see you again from now on and cannot return to your arms. I hope that whether we can see each other again or not, you will not forget me. (2) Listen to the sound of the bugle, sad and heroic, calling us to charge forward. Mother, may God bless us as we fight for justice. Shouting loudly, the sound shakes far and wide, and the military appearance is awe-inspiring. Men live for the group and die for the group, and bleeding on the battlefield is glorious. Mother, maybe I will never see you again from now on and cannot return to your arms. I hope that whether we can see each other again or not, you will not forget me.

### Two Soldiers Attacked on North Suzhou Road in Two Days; First-Class Seaman Watanabe Injured in Fingertip; Japanese Army Deployed for Vigilance and to Search for the Culprit

At around 11:30 the night before last, two Japanese Marines were walking side by side and talking on North Suzhou Road at the northern end of the New Gate Bridge in the Public Concession. Suddenly, someone ambushed in the darkness and shot at the two soldiers. At that time, the two Japanese soldiers suddenly heard gunshots, realized that something was wrong, and quickly dodged. Unexpectedly, a bullet had already hit the finger of one of the soldiers. After the Japanese authorities received the news, they immediately dispatched a large team to be on guard and used searchlights to illuminate all directions to search for the shooter, but they did not find him. Until around 2:00 yesterday morning, the Japanese side searched the boats in the Suzhou River again. It was heard that several boatmen were arrested. As for the boats docked on the south bank, the Japanese side, together with the American defense forces and police officers, searched them until noon. It was also heard that when the boats were searched extensively, the boatmen were awakened from their sleep and suspected that something had happened. They were all panicked, and some jumped into the river to avoid the situation.

First-Class Seaman Shot in Finger

The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that at 11:30 last night (the 5th), two Japanese Marine sentries stationed in front of a certain Japanese-owned bakery on North Suzhou Road were unsuccessfully assassinated by a Chinese person. After the incident, the Japanese authorities, with the cooperation of the US Marines and foreign police officers of the Public Concession, arrested the murderer this morning (the 6th). Last night, when the murderer shot at the two Japanese sentries, only Watanabe, a first-class seaman, was injured in the fingertip. The murderer fired several other shots, but none hit the target.

Search Results, One Person Detained

After the case occurred, the US Marines cooperated with the Japanese authorities to conduct a search in the shooting area. The Japanese side believed that the murderer fired from a small boat in the Suzhou River, so they thoroughly searched the boats in the river. Until 11:00 this morning (the 6th), foreign police officers and Japanese soldiers were still searching. Suddenly, they saw a Chinese person running away, so they worked together to chase him and arrested him. They took him to the Ge Deng Road Police Station for questioning and then transferred him to the Japanese Marines. It was heard that the murderer's name was Mao Luobao (transliteration), 36 years old. He had confessed to the police and the Japanese authorities about the shooting. According to news this morning (the 6th), a certain Chinese person attempted to set fire to a wooden house in the Japanese military storage depot on Huishan Road on Sunday morning, but was arrested by the Japanese side and is still being detained. "

Extensive Searches in Nanshi and Zhabei

Also, the "China Press" reported that, according to the Allied News Agency, the Japanese Marines, together with the Japanese Military Police, have begun to make every effort to investigate terrorists in Nanshi and Zhabei. Yesterday, they stepped up the search of pedestrians to prevent hidden weapons and closely monitored the activities of suspicious Chinese people. According to the Japanese-language "Shanghai Daily News," the Japanese authorities have taken severe measures and have extensively arrested suspicious people. Last year, on April 20, a certain sergeant of the Japanese Military Police in Nanshi was shot and killed by a Communist Chinese person. After a year, the Japanese Military Police in Nanshi have recently arrested seven people, including Xu Helin (transliteration), who was the instigator of the assassination of the sergeant. Then, the Japanese Military Police and Marines arrested several murderers who killed two Japanese Military Police officers on Dada Yunwan Road at the beginning of last month.

### Yesterday Was Lichun Festival; Climate Turned Cooler; Mortality Rate Decreased

Yesterday was the old lunar Lichun Festival. Residents followed the custom of eating tea eggs, cherries, fermented rice wine, and other delicacies to celebrate the festival. The prices of various small dishes were expensive due to crowded purchases in various small vegetable markets.

### Truth About the Tragedy of Men and Women in the Dafang Hotel the Night Before; Ge Mingshi Secretly Had a Love Affair with His Step-Sister and Impregnated Her; Unemployed and Unable to Marry, He Died by Poisoning

Ge Mingshi from Suzhou, 28 years old this year, is not yet married. He used to be the manager of the Wanli Printing House, which specializes in printing money for the dead, set up by his cousin at No. 7 Xinkaihe Road in the French Concession. He worshiped Mr. Ji Shibao (47 years old this year) and his wife from Zhenjiang at No. 17 next door as adoptive parents. Ji has an eldest daughter named Shundi, 20 years old this year, who is not yet engaged. Ge and Ji spent

Time Together Day and Night

They fell in love with each other and made a private agreement to be together for life. Unexpectedly, Ge, because he had money in his hand in the store, went to the gambling den in the Six Nations Hotel in West Shanghai to gamble every day, which resulted in a huge loss. His cousin found out about this and, fearing that the store would be dragged down, dismissed Ge from his managerial position. Ge has been unemployed since then and has been living with the Ji family for a long time. However, Ji's daughter, Shundi, and Ge have been having an affair, and she is now pregnant and her abdomen is bulging.

Approaching Childbirth

Mr. and Mrs. Ji Shibao, seeing that what was done cannot be undone and that they have no children of their own, agreed to marry Shundi to Ge. Because the delivery date is approaching, they ordered Ge to quickly find a matchmaker to get married in order to save face. However, Ge not only does not have the funds to get married, but also, during the period of unemployment, the couple's life will be impossible to maintain after marriage. Moreover, with the woman about to give birth, there is no way to raise funds for the delivery costs. They felt the economic

Heavy Pressure

And were ashamed to stand in the world. After discussing with Ji Shundi, they both decided to take their own lives. On the afternoon of the 3rd, Ge borrowed money from a friend and then went out with the woman to the Dafang Hotel in Zhengjia Muqiao, using the pseudonym Huang Wensheng, and opened Room 229 to stay for one night. They discussed the method of suicide. The next day, they bought poisonous water and took it together that night to commit suicide. By noon on the 5th, the waiter discovered that the woman was

Dead in Bed

Ge was still breathing, so he reported to the accountant and sent Ge to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the woman's body was sent to the coroner's office. Not long after Ge arrived at the hospital, he died and his body was sent to the coroner's office. After an examination yesterday, the bodies of both the man and woman were claimed by their respective family members for burial.

### Six Thai Ships Testing Rice Transport

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Third International Yangtze River Shipping Company and the North and South Ocean shipping lines have been greatly threatened. Therefore, Jardine Matheson and Taikoo in this city have opened up lines from Shanghai to Singapore, Shanghai to Myanmar (Yangon), and Shanghai to Siam (Bangkok, Thailand). However, the routes are long and the transportation is light. Only on the return journey from Yangon and Bangkok can imported rice be carried. The Thai Shipping Company, seeing that the amount of Siamese rice transported to Shanghai is very large, intends to open up the Shanghai-Siam money line and send six ships for trial voyages. The first ship, SS. Sisunthon, arrived at the port at around 2:00 pm yesterday and docked at Longmao Wharf in Pudong, carrying 30,000 bags of Siamese rice. This ship is the first ship on the China-Thailand new money line. The Thai Shipping Company has commissioned Thai Seng Lee Public Company and Tong Yick Shipping Company as agents in this city.

### Food: A Heartening Move, Rice Prices Have Fallen for Two Consecutive Days, The Public Works Department's Efforts Are Insufficient, but the Profits from Hoarding Rice Are Still Considerable

The price of foreign rice continued to plummet yesterday. The prices of both spot and futures rice fell sharply, showing a weak trend with heavy selling pressure. The situation was no less severe than the previous surge in prices. The fact that Hong Kong rice has arrived in Shanghai at par price has been confirmed, and there is also the possibility of Vietnamese rice following up to provide relief. Compared with the market price, which is a standard price of 110 yuan, the difference of 30 to 40 yuan means that the price cannot stand firm. Those who made floating profits were selling as much as they could, and large households were also shaken in their confidence in higher prices. Therefore, after opening the price, it gradually fell. For example, No. 1 Saigon fell straight from the initial opening price of 145 yuan to 140 yuan (some say it was as low as 136 yuan), Xiaojiao fell from 135 yuan to 130 yuan, Mindang fell to 132 or 3 yuan, Tokyo Tip fell to 131 yuan, and Crushed Tip fell from 112 yuan to 109 or 6 yuan, a sharp drop of 8 or 9 yuan from the previous closing price. At this point, the sales market gradually became active, and the downward trend subsided, hovering all the way until the close of the market, where there was little change. Futures in Yinhua Company (one stone and two dou and a half), No. 1 Saigon for April and May opened at 162 yuan, Xiaowen at 157 yuan, all down by more than ten yuan, and Crushed Rice at 124 yuan was also down by six yuan from the previous price. The total transaction volume of spot rice for the day was less than 5,000 bags, but there were 50,000 to 60,000 bags arriving. The transaction volume of Yinhua Company was 500 tons. Although rice prices have fallen by more than ten yuan in two days, rice merchants still have a profit of 40 to 50 yuan per bag because the price was raised too quickly and too high this time. This drop is just a matter of earning a little less. However, the public anticipates that if rice merchants still have no intention of repenting, then the tragic decline of cotton yarn speculation last year may be seen in this year's rice hoarding. However, Shanghai citizens, seeing that rice prices have fallen for two consecutive days, attribute it to the Public Works Department's rice setting efforts, and celebrate with their hands on their foreheads, still hoping for the earliest possible and most appropriate distribution method to meet the eager expectations of those who are waiting to be fed.

This newspaper continues to receive Zheng Shixian's opinions on the sale of Hong Kong rice. The full text is very long, and the main points are recorded and published as follows. It is briefly stated that the rice shops undertaking the sale of fair-priced rice must be strictly supervised to prevent malpractices. Anticipated malpractices include: (A) Raising prices, not transporting at the prescribed prices, and raising prices for sale without authorization. (B) Mixing, selling other low-grade rice mixed in. (C) Adulterating, that is, mixing rice with inferior quality and selling it. The rice sold on the market now is expensive, but the quality of the rice is getting worse and worse. Expensive prices are paid for bad rice, and some are mixed with mud and sand, which is even more abhorrent. (D) Reducing the quantity. According to the current regulations for the rice industry, each market stone of rice should weigh 156 market catties net weight, and 160 catties including the two bags. When selling, some deliberately reduce the weight by one or two catties, and some deliberately add to the weight of the bag skin to increase the weight. Also, when selling by升斗, some put cardboard in the container, all of which are methods of stealing and reducing the quantity. For the above-mentioned malpractices, in addition to the selling price being printed by the Public Works Department on the distribution hanging plaque, which can avoid tricks and random sayings, in terms of quality, the Public Works Department should make glass boxes and put sample rice in them for the public to compare (this idea is taken from the editorial of this newspaper in Japan). However, rice shops may not be willing to accept and actually display this sample. I think it can be placed in a public place in each area, or a police agency, so that the public can go there to compare. As for the quantity, the Public Works Department should place market catty scales in the same place (that is, public places or police agencies) so that the public can go there to measure after purchasing rice. If inconsistencies are found in terms of quality or quantity, the public should be allowed to file charges based on the circumstances.

It has been rumored for a long time that the Thai wheel Xishengtong Company will transport rice to Shanghai. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The wheel was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 1st of this month, but due to a slight delay on the way, it only entered the port yesterday afternoon and docked at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong. It is estimated that 30,000 bags of Siamese foreign rice were transported, and there are many more wheels transporting directly. (Zu)

Glutinous rice is also difficult to support between this time when foreign rice is recovering. There are only some sporadic appetites in the sales market. The market is low because the selling price is low, so although the decline is not as severe as that of foreign rice, the price of Hong Kong Baiyuan is 136 or 7 yuan, and the price of Glutinous Tea is 122 yuan. As for Guomi such as thick and thin粳, they all retreated because the general visitors saw the continuous fierce plunge, and all did not open.

### Canadian Flour Plunges in Value

Flour: The current foreign flour market situation is due to the sharp fall in rice prices, and there are still more than 200,000 bags of American flour to be shipped to Shanghai within days. As a result, people's hearts are weak, and the actual sales and hoarders are watching each other. The market transaction is quite calm. In the morning market, Australian flour was once quoted at 33 yuan, but no one paid attention to it in the afternoon. The price of Jinlong brand Canadian flour was 33 yuan, a sharp drop to 32 yuan, a drop of more than one yuan, and there was no considerable recipient. According to market discussions, the future of the flour market will depend on the rice price situation. If the rice price falls again, it will not be surprising to see a fall of 2 or 3 yuan. The flat-selling powder of Chinese factories is still 29 yuan, and it is necessary to reduce the wholesale price when necessary. There is no market for wheat.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Japanese Merchants Dump Corn, Cake, Soybean Oil Also Fall

Yesterday's miscellaneous grains, oil, and cake market situation continued to soften in the wake of the news of the sharp drop in rice prices. All kinds of transactions were reduced suddenly, and the market fell frequently. Although there are still those who are trying to struggle on the surface, the environment is changing and the support is weak. The trend is downstream. It is estimated that the price of corn has fallen sharply due to the hope that the Zhejiang sales market will suddenly be dumped by the goods transported by Japanese merchants, resulting in a double blow. Yesterday, futures have disappeared. Only 500 bags of Saigon's current corn were opened. Chen's price fell from 35 yuan and 7 jiao to 34 yuan, and the new price was 37 yuan to 36 yuan and 8 jiao. The price of 200 bags of Dutch yellow corn was only 36 yuan. A total of about 10,000 pieces of bean cake were traded. It is estimated that the lower delivery price of Yuanlong cake in May was 19 yuan, 5 jiao and 7 and a half cents. The lower delivery price of Yuanji cake in May was 20 yuan, 0 jiao and 9 jiao to 7 and a half cents. The upper delivery price of Shengji cake in May was 21 yuan and 6 jiao, and the lower delivery in May was 21 yuan, 7 jiao to 6 jiao, and then 22 yuan. The upper delivery price in June was 22 yuan, 7 jiao to 23 yuan and 5 cents.

Also, 400 pieces of bean cake are now being transported to Siam.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Gradually Loosens

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, HSBC's listed exchange rates did not change. The dark market of the British and American exchange rates continued to loosen and cheapen. Chinese merchants and speculators came to stuff them fiercely after the morning opening. The Chinese Commercial Bank also supplied more than it demanded. However, HSBC absorbed more than 200,000 yuan in US dollars in the first half of the day. American banks also squeezed in, but none of them wanted cheap prices. The US dollar was loose at 5 yuan and 21875 to settle. The British gold was hard to 3 pence and 234375. In the afternoon, there was news of the Spring Competition, but there were no transactions. The market was stagnant.

Chinese merchants and speculators first stuffed the Citibank with 15,000 US dollars for the next month, at a price of 5 yuan and 21875, and then it became hard to sell to settle. HSBC's listed exchange rates did not change. After the white silver balance tax was levied at about 24.50%, Chinese banks and speculators forced the US dollar price for May and June to be 5 yuan and 21875. HSBC alone took in more than 200,000 yuan, and the Chinese Mainland Bank also sold. At noon, the appetite for progress turned weak, so the market closed firmly at 3 pence and 234375 for British gold and 5 yuan and 21875 for US dollars.

### Securities: Turnaround in the Domestic Debt Market

### Liu Weishan Holds a Solo Calligraphy Exhibition

Mr. Liu Weishan, a famous calligrapher in Shanghai, has a deep understanding of Chinese studies and is particularly proficient in the study of writing. Therefore, his calligraphy is the most outstanding. He uses his pen with an empty fist and dense fingers, suspending his wrist in the middle and concentrating the strength of his whole body to the bottom of his wrist when writing, connecting Taijiquan methods to the brushwork. Therefore, a grand atmosphere permeates the paper, deeply embodying the meaning of great strength and abundant sinews. Mr. Liu has been writing for decades and is proficient in all styles. In recent years, he has been constantly studying calligraphy teaching methods, taking it as his responsibility to guide future generations. Therefore, the Shanghai Guangdong East Middle School Jingwu Sports Association Linchi Group has hired Mr. Liu to guide calligraphy, achieving remarkable results. Historian Zhang Yuquan wrote a poem to him, saying, "Mr. Liu is well-versed in literature and history, and his pen has been sharpened for thirty years. I happened to pass by and wrote a wrong word, where is the ink pool at the highest peak?" Furthermore, scholar She Yigong encouraged him with a poem, saying, "Calligraphy has always been difficult to master, and some ridicule it as a trivial skill like carving insects. Immersing oneself in it for a long time will make it more fluent, and the paper will be full of clouds and smoke, creating the art of nature." Now, Mr. Liu is exhibiting a joint calligraphy and painting exhibition with his friend, painter Yuan Songnian, starting from May 5th, displayed for a week in the book hall of the Great World Department Store.

### Sino-Western Cup Table Tennis Tournament, Group A: Friends of the Nation Loses to Xinya

In the Sino-Western Cup table tennis tournament, at 8:30 the night before, the defending champion Xinya played against Xianggang Zheng She at the Xianggang Zheng She Club. The former was the champion of the Zongjing Cup, Kongsheng Cup, and Xinliu Cup triple crown last year, with generals such as Ouyang Wei, Zhang Yunsheng, Yang Xiang, etc. The latter is a rising force, making a splash in the Xinliu Cup and jumping to third place. In yesterday's competition, Friends of the Nation underestimated the enemy and replaced Yang Zhaoxiang with Zhang Qiling. Zhang Yun lost five matches, which was the main reason for the failure. As a result, Xinya defeated Friends of the Nation by a score of thirteen to nine, which is unexpected and gives them a chance to win the championship.

### Exciting Battle in the Western Qing Women's Volleyball Group: Youxing and Minli Face Off Tonight; The Last Game in Group A: Yinghua Meets Western Qing

The Western Qing volleyball tournament had three games last night (May 5th). In the women's group, Minli vs. Western Qingjiang was one-sided. In the morning, Minli took the lead with a score of 23 to 12, and ultimately defeated Western Qingjiang with a score of 47 to 16, creating a great record of five wins in five games. They won with two straight sets, achieving a record of four wins in all four games, and standing side by side with the Giants at the top. Tonight at 6:30, there will be one game each in the A, B, and women's groups. In the women's group, Minli will play against Youxing. The former has a very strong lineup in this tournament and has won every game. The latter is the defending champion, only losing to Huxing once since the start of the tournament this year. The lineup is solid and well-organized. Tonight, they will meet on a narrow road, and a fierce battle is inevitable. The last game in Group A is between the defending champion Western Qing team Yinghua. The former is likely to win. However, Western Qing's current record is only equal to that of the Russian Overseas Chinese team. A separate final will have to be scheduled to determine the champion. The schedule is as follows:

This Week's Banking Industry Basketball Tournament

China Savings Shanghai Final

China Fortune Defeated Citibank the Other Day

Ten teams from the banking and currency industries participated in the third banking industry basketball tournament, vying for victory. However, China Insurance withdrew midway in the banking group, and Sichuan United was an exhibition team in the currency group. Therefore, in reality, only four teams each joined in both groups. The entire group schedule has been completed. In the last game the other day, China Fortune in the currency group defeated Citibank by a score of 12 to 8. According to the records of both groups, the Central Savings Association in the banking group won three games out of three, earning the top spot. Shanghai in the currency group lost to Sichuan United, but Sichuan United was not counted in the score. Therefore, Shanghai also won three games out of three, ranking first. The two teams are scheduled to play in the final this week to compete for the overall championship. The records of both groups are as follows:

(Banking Group) (Currency Group)

Team Name Wins Losses Team Name Wins Losses

China Savings Association 3 0 Shanghai 3 0

Guanghua 2 1 Jinyuan 2 1

Overseas Chinese 1 2 China Fortune 1 2

How to Choose Books (III) Zhou Liangsheng

I. On the Cultivation of Character Everyone has their own personality, environment, interests, and hobbies. Reading this type of book should also not be the same for everyone. However, when choosing this type of book, the following standards should be noted:

(1) The Purpose Should Be Pure Books with a pure purpose can serve as a guide for cultivating our body and mind. However, the principles described in them contain some spatial and temporal aspects and cannot "be passed on to future generations unchanged, and applied to all corners of the world." When selecting and reading this type of book, the most important thing is to be able to use it to encourage our ambition and teach us how to deal with people and things.

(2) The Implication Should Be Noble Some books have particularly rich and noble implications for cultivating character. When we select and read this type of book, we can taste it carefully, and it can unconsciously make our whole body move as if it were "fermenting." When we reach this point, we can take it a step further and apply it as a ladder for cultivating our character.

(3) The Records Should Be Faithful Books that faithfully record how to deal with the world and establish oneself can teach us the principles of being a person, correct our words and deeds in the world, and guide us in methods of self-cultivation. When we select and read this type of book, it is very helpful for cultivation.

II. On the Enhancement of Knowledge and Abilities Human life includes both social and natural aspects. All human activities are nothing more than coping with these two environments. In order to cope with these two environments, we must first have the knowledge and abilities to cope with them. Books on social science can enhance our knowledge and abilities to cope with the social environment. Although the knowledge and abilities we acquire from books are sometimes not as intimate as those acquired from actual life, they can help us to understand society, cope with the environment, recognize nature, and conquer the natural environment. In short, both social science and natural science are expressions of human knowledge and abilities. When we select and read these two types of books, we should have the following two standards:

(1) Novel Material Social phenomena are changing with each passing day and constantly evolving and developing. Therefore, books on social science are always more exciting when the material is newer. Natural phenomena do not evolve as quickly as social phenomena. However, humans are ultimately not completely slaves to nature. People are conquering nature day by day. Humans have constantly new discoveries about the natural world. Therefore, books on natural science are also better when the material is newer.

(2) Rich Common Sense "It is a shame for a Confucian scholar not to know one thing." This exaggerated aspiration is certainly not necessary. However, the spirit of "it is a shame for a Confucian scholar not to know one thing" is something we should have. We must have the ability to understand the phenomena of the universe and our daily life. Then, we should select and read scientific books with rich common sense.

### Records of the Speculators' Confession: "When Things Reach an Extreme, They Revert"

— Pan Peiying

The prices of goods these days seem to be going crazy, soaring straight to the peak, as if they will never reach the top, increasing day and night without stopping. Sure enough, the speculators are laughing, while the citizens are truly suffering.

But this kind of unreasonable, rampant increase is ultimately a temporary and local abnormality. Experience tells us: "When things reach an extreme, they revert!" Sooner or later, prices will definitely fall back. At the moment, the speculators see that some of the common people cannot afford the cost of living, and some are begging for food, while others are starving to death. In the future, the citizens will definitely see some of the speculators falling to their deaths, and others being arrested by officials. Who can guarantee that money gained through evil deeds can be enjoyed peacefully?

"No evidence, no trust." Without proof, no one will listen to these honest words. Well, let's provide a few facts for reference:

First: Please see the May 3rd newspaper, which clearly records that the price of gasoline in Chongqing plummeted from 50 yuan to 20 yuan per gallon, a drop of 30 yuan, a drop of more than half. Needless to say, some gasoline speculators must have fallen along with it.

Second: As the saying goes, "High prices attract goods from afar." And when more goods arrive from afar, they will compete with each other in the market, and prices will automatically be lowered. Please look at the market for new medicine tonics. Recently, the German Prussian Pharmaceutical Factory has joined in dumping, so the competition is quite fierce. Also, see the May 5th news that nine Soviet ships and five Thai ships have joined in transporting rice and coal to Shanghai. As the number of runs increases, the freight rates will inevitably fall. How alarmed will the "speculators" who have spent a lot of money eating up spot goods be when they see this kind of news?

Third: Just ask Shandong merchants or people who have lived in Harbin for a long time, and they will tell you how Shandong people and Harbin merchants transported goods to Europe for sale and made a fortune during the Russian Revolution. Some people started with one or two thousand yuan and made four or five hundred thousand. Of course, everyone was happier and happier doing it. Taking advantage of the convenience of trains that could go directly, everyone simply chartered train cars, transporting goods on a large scale of tens of millions. Unexpectedly, when the revolution broke out, such high-profit goods that endangered the purchasing power of the masses were naturally difficult to tolerate, and all the goods that arrived were simply confiscated. As a result, many speculators lost everything, including their capital and profits. Those who were able to return to their hometowns with only the clothes on their backs were considered extremely lucky.

Hello: Speculators, you might as well remember this kind of story, and be careful that your goods will "fall in price," be "detained," or be "confiscated." Foreign newspapers have already said that the current Shanghai is full of crises and is not a good place to live and work in peace!

### Ink Splashes

— Qian Fei

We shouldn't think that the fashionable women standing outside the windows of department stores are choosing items. Many of them are "admiring themselves" in the windows!

At the turn of spring and summer, it is again the time when the "bloodsuckers"—stinky fleas—are active. Those who bear the brunt, of course, are those of us salary earners who cannot afford to live in tall buildings. But after tasting the taste of blood this year, the "bloodsuckers" will definitely stop and sigh, saying: "Who has already sucked up almost all of the plump blood before us, leaving only some thin blood that has lost its original purity?"

The Chinese value face the most. Wearing clothes requires face, eating requires face, and speaking also requires face. It seems that "face" is like a second life. In fact, it's just that everyone's circumstances are different, and the enjoyment of life varies. One should never think that one is "losing face" just because one's enjoyment is lower.

The more blood people have, the more they cherish their blood. People with less blood, on the other hand, regard their own blood as not worth cherishing. For example, big-bellied merchants with fat bodies and rosy faces, whose whole bodies are filled with blood, still think it is not enough and often want poor people to donate blood to them. Laborers who are as thin as firewood are busy with life all day long, dripping with sweat and blood at any time and place, but they still work non-stop without caring at all.

### When Gasoline Prices Rise

— Zhong Ken

The guard respectfully pulled the door open. Manager Wu, chest puffed out and belly protruding, strode in with a large leather bag. Tap, tap, tap, tap, the sound of leather shoes echoed. The clerks in the office stood up and bowed until Manager Wu's body disappeared into the manager's office before they sat down lightly.

"Ha, ha, Manager, good morning," Deputy Manager Ye said, swaying his fat body while scratching his scalp.

"Hmm... yesterday," Manager Wu said, finally relaxing his stern face, putting the leather bag aside, and sinking into the sofa. "Yesterday that game of mahjong, hey, three times I won, really... ha, ha, you—were also there?"

"Yes, yes," one hand was still scratching his scalp. The deputy manager flattered, "Manager is blessed with great luck... ha, ha, yesterday, you had a good hand. You won several thousand yuan... ha, ha, really..."

Manager Wu also smiled contentedly, simply putting his legs up on the writing desk.

"Hey, uh, that batch of goods the day before yesterday, did you—" Suddenly, Manager Wu stood up and asked anxiously.

"Sold, sold..." Deputy Manager Ye answered with narrowed eyes. "However, there is still that, that batch of white paper. The market is still the same, almost the same. I think, let's sell it in two days."

"Hey, hey," the deputy manager flattered again, dialing the telephone, "... what, hey, hey,... uh, that... um um, good,... this, what!... good!" He took out a handkerchief to wipe the sweat from his brow, looking at the manager.

"What's the matter?..." Manager Wu paced over, anxiously, "How's the market? Is it..."

"No—nothing, it's almost the same as yesterday, but—hey, it is said that gasoline has risen a few cents..."

"Gasoline has risen!" Manager Wu jumped up. He still took a car to the office this morning. The gasoline he uses has risen in price. Manager Wu thought about it and felt a little heartache. "Missed the opportunity!... Why didn't you buy it for me earlier?"

"This, uh. Uh, I didn't expect it either. But—" Deputy Manager Ye said in horror, "But..."

"Alright,... in short, it can be said that it was a misstep." The manager pondered, clenching his hand into a fist in the air.

"Tap, tap." Suddenly, there was a finger tapping on the door. "Come in!" Manager Wu ordered, his face sinking again.

The person who came in was—a dusty gray robe, disheveled hair, and a thin, angular face. The manager recognized this as an employee of the cashier's office. "What is it?" the manager asked sternly. He was feeling a little bad in his heart.

"I..." The angular face turned red. "I want to ask Manager to advance some salary..."

"What?"

"No, Manager," the angular face was still saying, "Life is really too hard to live,... Yesterday rice and coal rose a lot again..."

"Humph! Rice... coal has risen!" Manager Wu waved his hand to let the angular face out. He was about to say: Don't you know that gasoline has also risen? But he finally didn't say it. He lowered his head...

"So, I say, the lives of employees should not be too comfortable. Look, they are simply getting an inch and wanting a mile," this time it was the deputy manager's voice.

Manager Wu pondered, and suddenly he cried out. He was occupied by a novel idea. Humph, I'm going to ask the board of directors to increase the gasoline allowance. What is enough for a gasoline allowance of one hundred and fifty yuan!..."

(VII) Draw a Cross on the Face

A cross! How could this still look like a face, like a person?

"Ji Zhaoxiong, you have also received my kindness...! " His bound body immediately trembled like he had a fever, and his voice was very loud and miserable, truly like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered. "If you are still a person, if you still have a shred of conscience, please kill me quickly!"

As soon as Yuan Baofan heard Qiu Haitang's first sentence, he flashed his eyes towards Ji Zhaoxiong; but today, he was in the process of employing people, and of course he didn't want to deal with him first, deciding to investigate slowly later.

"Death isn't that easy!" Ji Zhaoxiong was truly an insidious and ruthless fellow. Hearing Qiu Haitang's miserable cry, he remained unmoved, and his feet ran even faster. "You wait! In less than five minutes, I will come in to serve you!"

Now Qiu Haitang only had a glimmer of hope left, and that was for Yuan Shaowen to come back quickly.

Strangely enough, he had clearly seen Shaowen rush out from inside just now, and he was only wearing a set of spun silk shorts and shirt. Logically, he shouldn't be going out. Why couldn't he see him coming in now? Seeing that such a big disturbance had arisen, he actually hid and didn't ask or hear about it. This didn't seem like Shaowen's usual behavior! So when would he come out?

Qiu Haitang stared unblinkingly at the door leading to the outside, waiting, hoping that Shaowen would be able to come back in time to save him.

"Seventh Master! Seventh Master, Shaowen! Shaowen!..." When he was at his wit's end, he could only shout at the top of his lungs.

"Good boy! Won't you be quiet for a while!" Yuan Baofan walked up impatiently and immediately used a towel to block his mouth. (Ninety-nine)

### "Do You Have Money?"

— Li Yun

I don't remember which newspaper had an eye-catching advertisement that day: It said that a certain medical doctor had just come to Shanghai from a certain place and could cure diseases with two small metal rods. The method was to insert these metal rods into the nostrils, and then correct the nerves in the nose that connect to the location of the disease.

I have always been a creature dominated by curiosity, so I decided to ask about this newly invented medical technique; but the problem was that I didn't have any free time, so I had to wait patiently for the opportunity to come.

The opportunity came, and of course I grabbed it and wouldn't let it escape. At about 4:00 PM on the 22nd of this month, I went to the address, Room No. X on the seventh floor of the X Hotel on the Bund, and walked in with a half-believing heart. A friend in a Western suit came to meet me. "Are you here to see Doctor So-and-so?" I said, "Yes, sir." He then made a gesture of invitation: "Then please sit here for a while." When I sat down on the noble green velvet sofa, there were already several handsome blue-eyed men and women sizing me up with contemptuous glances. I was wearing yellow leather shoes, a dark blue serge cheongsam, and the latest style glasses on my nose. Although I couldn't be considered the "true essence" of the word "modern," I thought I had the demeanor of a well-bred young lady, except that my hair was a little too neat, which was because I was a student.

Two compatriots across from me, who also valued clothing over people, were also looking at me with a strange, neurotic gaze. I, on the other hand, was free and unconcerned, and instead boldly inspected everything around me, marveling at how Doctor X, indeed, lived up to his name by staying in such a luxurious hotel.

After waiting for a long time, the person who had invited me in earlier took a letter pad, holding a piece of paper with a patient's name and address written on it, and said to me: "Please write your name and address; Chinese will do." After I finished writing, I put it on the aristocratic coffee table in front of me. I waited for a long time again, and seemed to be getting a little impatient; but there was no way, since I had walked in, I had to find out what was going on. As the saying goes, "In for a penny, in for a pound," I stood up and walked to where the Western-suited friend was sitting: "Excuse me, how much is the consultation fee?" He said faintly: "Sixty yuan." At this time, I was really uneasy in my heart, but my appearance still deliberately pretended to be calm: "Oh! Sixty yuan?" He showed a contemptuous expression: "The consultation fee here is very expensive. To see him eight times will cost four hundred and eighty yuan. You should let him take a look first." I went with him on the spot, but who knew that when I walked to the small corridor between the two connected rooms, he suddenly stopped: "What exactly are your problems?" I explained my purpose, and he continued incessantly: "Is this okay? To see him eight times will cost you four hundred yuan, there's no cheaper than that. Hey! What is your family's economic situation? Where does your father work?..." Because I was clear about the purpose of this trip, my words were hesitant and vague. Coincidentally, a Western woman walked out of the consultation room to pay, which relieved my embarrassment, and I slipped out silently, giving that magnificent room a resentful glance before leaving.

### Expectations for the Xian Ni Society

— Nan

In this day when Kunqu Opera is extremely degraded, Shanghai still has a Kunqu Opera troupe—and it is also the only Kunqu Opera troupe in the country—that is still working hard, gritting its teeth to overcome various difficulties. The fighting spirit of the Xian Ni Society is indeed worthy of our admiration.

However, according to Zhang Chuanfang and Zheng Chuanjian, after the Dragon Boat Festival, the Xian Ni Society plans to stop performing and take a summer break. The reason is that the venue of the Dongfang Shuchang is too hot, and performing in the summer will not only cause the actors to sweat profusely, but the audience may also not be able to bear it.

This news makes all social figures who love Kunqu Opera or care about the Xian Ni Society feel quite sad. Because the Xian Ni Society has had extremely brilliant achievements in the past, and it still wins social praise and care now. In the future, I dare to assert, it will definitely continue to receive the support of people from all walks of life. Therefore, in order to cherish the glorious history of the Xian Ni Society in the past, I have to say a few words to the gentlemen of the Xian Ni Society.

(1) Have self-confidence—Anyone who has studied the history of Chinese and Western drama knows that the most perfect drama in the world has the richest musical elements and the most profound literary atmosphere. This is an iron law universally recognized by modern Western playwrights. Of course, Kunqu Opera itself contains many shortcomings, but its musical components and literary meaning are exceptionally rich. There is no reason for this kind of drama to be obliterated. Therefore, as long as the Xian Ni Society is willing to continue fighting, the hope for the future is immeasurable.

(2) Cherish yourselves—You must know that the establishment of a troupe is not an easy task. Mr. Mu Ouchu spent a lot of money and effort to establish the Kunqu Opera Training Institute (in the year of Xinyou). Afterwards, Mr. Tao Xiquan and Mr. Yan Huiyu took over and renamed it Xin Yuefu (in the year of Bingyin), and they also put in a lot of effort. Therefore, the members of the troupe should cherish this long-standing Xian Ni Society even more, so as not to fail the expectations of Mr. Mu, Tao, and Yan. Moreover, the members of the troupe are all brothers who have depended on each other from childhood to adulthood, and their friendship is better than that of blood relatives. They should love and understand each other.

(3) Strive for self-improvement—The members of the troupe have quite profound attainments in drama. For example, Zhu Chuanming's unmarried female roles, Zhang Chuanfang's supporting female roles, Zheng Chuanjian's male roles, Zhou Chuanying's young male roles with pheasant feathers, Wang Chuansong's clown roles, and Zhao Chuanqun's crowned male roles are all rare talents. However, as the old saying goes, "As heaven maintains vigor through movement, a gentleman should constantly strive for self-improvement." Art has no limits, and it is necessary for all members to strive for excellence.

(4) Exercise self-control—Shanghai is indeed a civilized city, but it is also a den of sin. The four things, "eating, dressing, prostitution, and gambling," constantly tempt people to walk down the path of depravity. These four things are also often inextricably linked with people in the opera world. Of course, most of the members of the Xian Ni Society are clean and self-respecting, but it cannot be said that there are absolutely no people who have gone astray. Everyone knows that tobacco and alcohol are poisons that ruin the voice and demoralize the spirit. It would be best to abstain completely.

In short, China now has only one Kunqu Opera troupe left, the Xian Ni Society. There are only a few Kunqu Opera talents left in the Xian Ni Society (Han Shichang and Bai Yunsheng are from the Yiyang Opera). For the sake of the future of Kunqu Opera and for the sake of Chinese culture, we have to place our last hope of revitalizing Kunqu Opera on the Xian Ni Society. That is why I dare to speak frankly and say these harsh words, hoping that the gentlemen of the Xian Ni Society will not disappoint us. (Que Chou)

### Hollywood News

— Xiao Fang

MGM is doing its best to overwhelm "The Great Ziegfeld" with the lavish musical film "Ziegfeld Girl." In terms of cast alone, it is already astonishing. It has James Stewart, Lana Turner, Judy Garland, Hedy Lamarr, and other supporting roles such as Tony Martin, Jackie Cooper, Ian Hunter, and Edward Arnold, with more than a thousand dancers. It is indeed worthy of the name of a million-dollar blockbuster. The director is also the famous Robert Z. Leonard, whose masterpieces include "The Firefly" and "The Great American Broadcast."

The "Highest Grossing Stars" voting campaign recently held in Hollywood has ended. Clark Gable topped the list (as he did last year), followed by Spencer Tracy, Tyrone Power, Bette Davis, James Cagney, and Bing Crosby. As for the eighth place, it is Judy Garland, the ninth is Greer Garson, and the tenth is Gene Autry. Alice Faye and Shirley Temple were excluded from the top ten, and Deanna Durbin was twelfth. As a foreign comet who has become popular in the American art scene, American movie fans are now very eager for her to appear on the screen again. Gary Cooper is still the most promising candidate for the male lead in "For Whom the Bell Tolls."

American movie fans generally elected William Holden and Lizabeth Scott as the fastest-rising male and female stars in 1940. Lizabeth Scott belongs to MGM, while Katharine Hepburn, William Powell, and Claudette Colbert are all after twelfth place.

The famous novel "For Whom the Bell Tolls" by the American new writer Hemingway, who recently traveled to China, has now been adapted into a movie by Paramount. However, the role of Maria was only recently decided to be played by Ingrid Bergman, who became famous in the film industry for her performance in "Intermezzo." She is a Swedish Hollywood actress. In addition to Greta Garbo, she played the role of a female nurse in the "Dr. Kildare" series. Her acting skills have improved rapidly recently, and she has received good reviews in "Rage in Heaven," and all parties have high expectations for her. As for William Holden, he belongs to Paramount. Two years ago, he co-starred with Barbara Stanwyck in "Golden Boy" and gave a very excellent performance. Recently, he and Jean Arthur have both given excellent performances in "Arizona." However, since the filming of "Arizona," he has been on strike because his request to the company for a salary increase was not granted.

### Gleanings

— Lan Yu

Recently, Shanghai has been short of coal, and the power company has repeatedly advised Shanghai users to try their best to save electricity, not to exceed 1,000 degrees, otherwise it will be calculated at six times the price. Saving electricity is extremely inconvenient for movie theaters, because summer is coming soon, and many viewers are in the same space for two hours. Air conditioning is of course essential, but the power company's restrictions on the use of electricity will definitely reduce the number of viewers. Therefore, some people say that each movie theater plans to install fans (although they also use electricity, they save much more electricity than air conditioning). Others say that they will use large ice blocks for cooling using scientific methods. Of course, both of these methods are not as good as air conditioning. I wonder if there will be better methods to replace air conditioning in the near future!

### Summary of the Philosophy of Vigorous Action

— Zong Yu

You must use methods that force you to act to maintain the spirit of movement, gradually arouse interest, gain experience in movement, experience the value of movement, and generate a firm belief. Only then will non-stop action become your basic attribute.

Chapter 8: Fallen Flowers Intentionally Follow the Flowing Water

Zhou Yuji was benevolent and loving, humble and respectful to his subordinates. Sometimes he would summon Xu Jing to the yamen to talk to him about the situation of the world and military affairs. Xu Jing answered fluently, and Zhou Yuji valued him even more. However, Xu Jing did not have a fixed position. He only had to go to the yamen to sign in every day and leave if there was nothing to do. Most of the time, he would dance with swords and read books at Wang Yongtai's house. Wang Yongtai believed in Buddhism, and often ate vegetarian food and chanted sutras on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month and on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th days, sleeping alone in the outer room. He often said to Xu Jing that the past was like dust and unbearable to look back on. When he was young, he was brave and fierce, and he inevitably caused a lot of killing and injury in the world. Now that he was old, he could not help but feel somewhat empty and lost, so he used this to repent. Wang Yongtai's family had many female servants, but very few men. Xu Jing often saw a greasy young man with an unsightly appearance and frivolous demeanor, freely entering and leaving Wang's house, not like a guest. His bedroom was in the east wing next to Xu Jing's. When he saw Xu Jing, he was arrogant and impolite, which Xu Jing found very strange. Later, after Wang Yongtai's introduction, he learned that this person's surname was Sang, and his name was Yiqing, and he was He Ji's cousin. He was originally a merchant in Taiyuan, but later his business went bankrupt, and he returned to Daizhou. With nowhere to live, he asked He Ji for help. Wang Yongtai, for He Ji's sake, allowed him to stay in his home and asked him to take care of trivial matters. He catered to Wang's wishes in everything and was quite able to win people's hearts. Therefore, Wang Yongtai did not dislike him and allowed him to move freely in and out of the house, as if he were his own nephew. However, Xu Jing thought that Sang Yiqing did not seem like a gentleman and paid close attention to him. One day, Wang Yongtai was not at home. Xu Jing read a book for a while and felt a little tired. He took his Scarlet Phoenix Sword and went to the back garden, where he started to swing the sword vigorously on the open space. As he danced with great enthusiasm, he suddenly heard the laughter of women from the northeast corner. He stopped his sword and looked up, and saw a tower window on that side. It was the back room of Wang Yongtai's inner room. At this time, a beautiful woman and two or three maids were watching Xu Jing dance with the sword from the window. The beautiful woman was He Ji. When Xu Jing saw that he was being spied on by women, he had to put away his sword and stop dancing. Just as he was about to leave, a young maid came from the east corridor and said to Xu Jing with a smile, "Young Master Xu, my mistress invites you." Xu Jing did not know what was going on. Although he did not want to meet her, he could not leave without permission. The young maid said "please" again. Xu Jing had to put the sword back into its sheath and followed the young maid.

Shi Huibao, whose real name is Hui and whose courtesy name is Zhinong, is a descendant of the famous actor Shi Xiaofu. He sings old male roles. As a senior in the male role profession in the Pear Garden, he enjoyed great prestige twenty years ago. In recent years, due to old age and voice failure, he is no longer valued, which makes people feel that "an old pearl is worthless." Plays such as "Li Bai Drunk Writing" and "Jin Mamen" are all famous works praised by Hui in his early years. He is literate, the scripts are all written by him, and he is good at calligraphy and painting. His calligraphy is unanimously praised by people in the art world. Whenever he performs "Xi Hongchuan," he would often write large characters in public, and those who saw it praised him as a Confucian scholar in the actor world. Three years ago, he performed a short-term concert at the Golden Grand Theatre, and for a time, opera fans all came to watch, praising it as "an old tune replayed." His reputation is so high, which proves that the name of the typical old male character is well deserved. He is not good at financial management. To this day, he still uses his aging body to make a living in the Pear Garden in the old capital, selling calligraphy and paintings to support his later years. However, he has no children, which critics regret, and jokers call "Shi Yishi" cannot create heroes." (Preview: Next Saturday will feature Zhou Xinfang.)
