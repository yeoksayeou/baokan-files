(2) All troops have been completely re-equipped with new weapons, and they are uniformly standardized. The quality of the army has also improved. (3) Before 1939, the Chinese army was only attacked. From January of that year to the end of June of this year, of the 1,966 large and small battles, 47% of the important battles and 80% of the minor battles were initiated by the Chinese army. In the nine most important battles, except for Nanchang, Yichang, and Zhongtiaoshan, the other six completely defeated the Japanese army. (4) The Japanese army used 20 divisions in 1937, 30.5 in 1938, 35 in both 1939 and 1940, and 36.5 this year. Although the number of Japanese troops has increased, there has been no progress, which proves that China is becoming stronger as it fights. (Havas, 15th)

Editorial

### The Significance of the Anglo-Soviet Agreement

Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, various events and expressions have long indicated that Anglo-Soviet cooperation to defeat the forces of aggression is hardly a question anymore. If the world still has doubts, then the Anglo-Soviet agreement formally signed in Moscow on July 12 should completely clarify this clear international situation. The first article of the agreement makes the broadest and most thorough provision for the "assistance" and "support" given to each other in the work of cooperating to defeat "Germany under Hitler's rule." The second article specifically stipulates that: "During the war, unless mutually agreed, both parties will neither negotiate nor conclude any armistice agreement or treaty of peace." Although military alliance and other terms were not used in the wording, such broad and obvious provisions have in fact placed the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union in a completely allied relationship. If this is compared with the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan signed in Berlin on September 27 last year, the wording of this agreement is much stronger and more certain than that of the Tripartite Pact.

Of course, these two articles are only the most basic and simple principles. We can easily imagine all the detailed methods and implementation steps, and they are now being negotiated by the British and Soviet authorities and representatives in their respective capitals. The British military delegation has long arrived in the Russian capital, and under the leadership of British Ambassador Cripps, they have been holding talks with Stalin, Molotov, and other authorities; and the Soviet military mission has also arrived in London for several days. From the public, they have received universal cheers, and from the British authorities, they have received warm hospitality. Under the leadership of Ambassador Maisky to the UK, they are conducting sincere discussions with Churchill, Eden, and other major authorities. Placed before them, constituting the theme of the negotiations, are roughly two aspects: the first is the confirmation of the alliance relationship, and the second is the implementation of military and economic cooperation. Now, the first point can be regarded as having a clear and satisfactory conclusion, and from now on, everyone's attention is only on the success of military and economic cooperation.

Strictly speaking, based on the more than three weeks of the German-Soviet combat process, although the Soviet Union's position has retreated slightly, its military situation is obviously becoming stronger day by day; even at a minimum, its ability to independently contain the German advance and support the war situation is probably beyond doubt. Therefore, from a purely military point of view, its need for the help of British strength is not very urgent, and the most important significance probably has to be considered first in the area of international politics, followed by economic and resource cooperation. According to a Reuters London dispatch, the negotiation process of the Anglo-Soviet agreement has been fully understood and agreed by the United States and the British Dominions, which is indeed of great importance, so the broader international significance of the Anglo-Soviet agreement is that the democratic national front under the leadership of the United States has accepted the Soviet Union as a powerful new force; as for the Soviet Union, the righteous war it has always insisted on has been recognized as fully applicable to the Anglo-American fight against Germany. As for the cooperation of economic resources, there is the famous "Lend-Lease Act" initiated and presided over by President Roosevelt between the United States and Britain. In the future, the United States will, in accordance with the spirit of the Anglo-Soviet agreement, take a further step to expand the lend-lease object from China and Britain to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. If economic resources are fully cooperated among the four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, then, not only will the strength be strong, but it will also obviously occupy an overwhelming advantage. Even in terms of mutual access, a situation of accessibility will immediately appear. Starting from the Arctic Ocean in the far north, the Bering Strait, Vladivostok, the British and American territories in the Pacific Ocean, and the unlost areas of the Chinese coast, the southwestern and northwestern arteries of China, India, the Near East, the Middle East, the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, etc., can all be used as conduits for economic resource cooperation among the four countries, without being confined to a small number of routes such as the Port of Vladivostok, the Burma Road, and the Atlantic Ocean. In this way, no matter what methods the aggressors in the East and the West use, they will not be able to prevent the exchange, replenishment, and supply of economic resources among the four countries.

In addition to all of the above, in order to further avoid the suffering of a long-term world war, defeat the aggressors as soon as possible, and realize the bright future of mankind, of course, we still have to hope that Britain will immediately respond and cooperate with the Soviet Union militarily, launch an offensive, and wipe out the last fierce flame of violence in one fell swoop. Although the Anglo-Soviet agreement is only a general provision, under the principle of full alliance, there are also many military assistance and response routes that Britain can give to the Soviet Union at present. In terms of the air force, it can not only take advantage of the German defense being empty and further expand and intensify the bombing of Germany, but also send a large number of aircraft from its bases in the Near East to participate in the air battles between Germany and the Soviet Union. In terms of the navy, it can use warships and submarines in the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, and even the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea to launch extensive and penetrating bombardments and attacks on Germany, Italy, and their vassals and occupied countries. In terms of the army, it can intensify the war in Africa, send troops to land on any point on the coast of the European continent, and can also attack the Balkans through Turkey, and even, if necessary, can directly send troops to the Soviet Union to fight side by side. Of course, all of this is only in terms of general possible routes. If we look at the actual situation, what the Soviet Union most needs from Britain militarily at present is probably still in the two points of technology and war equipment design, especially in the naval and air aspects, Britain can now provide a lot of assistance to the Soviet Union.

Naval Battle Breaks Out in the Baltic Sea

Sixteen German Ships Sunk

United Press, Moscow, 15th – The Red Army General Headquarters stated that the Red Army has continued to resist enemy advances for the third day, still fighting to defend Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv. The Red Army has also launched numerous counterattacks, inflicting heavy damage on the German forces. Soviet air force continues to bomb German motorized units and the Polotsk oil region.

United Press, London, 15th – An Exchange Telegraph Moscow correspondent reported that Timoshenko, leading the Western forces, has launched offensives in several locations north of Rogachev and has crossed the Dnieper River. After crossing the river, Soviet forces drove back the German army by eighteen miles.

Reuters, Moscow, 15th – The Soviet Information Bureau issued a recent communiqué last night stating, "On the night of July 14, battles continued in the Northwest, West, and Southwest sectors. Soviet forces resisted enemy tank and motorized unit offensives, launching successive counterattacks and inflicting heavy losses. Soviet forces in the West and Soviet aircraft destroyed hundreds of enemy tanks and many enemy vehicles. In the Southwest, they repelled an attack by a large enemy force of three thousand, capturing a significant amount of artillery, machine guns, vehicles, and munitions. On July 13 and 14, the Soviet Air Force conducted night raids on enemy airfields, delivering powerful strikes to enemy troops, tanks, and motorized units. On the night of July 12, enemy transport ships carrying troops and tanks passed through the Baltic Sea, escorted by destroyers, patrol boats, speedboats, and fighters. The Soviet Baltic Fleet, in coordination with aircraft and coastal artillery, delivered a heavy blow, sinking two destroyers, thirteen transport ships, and one giant flat-bottomed boat carrying tanks. Thirteen other transport ships and one destroyer were damaged and caught fire. Soviet warships and aircraft suffered no damage."

United Press, Vichy, 15th – Military analysts here stated yesterday that the Soviet forces resisting in the central sector have effectively halted the German advance. A major battle for Leningrad is almost inevitable, as Leningrad is threatened by Finnish forces from the Karelian Isthmus and by German forces from the Southwest. German forces transferred from Lake Peipus to the Estonian front have cut off the Soviet army and navy's retreat routes in that area. The Soviet forces in that area can only escape by sea, but a large number of German torpedo boats and motorboats are patrolling the waters, preventing their withdrawal. It is reported that German forces moved troops southeast from Lake Peipus yesterday, attacking Pskov, a key hub of the "Stalin Line," with the support of tanks.

However, reports from abroad that German forces have already occupied Kyiv have not been confirmed.

Havas, Helsinki, 14th – General Headquarters issued a war report stating that on the north bank of Lake Ladoga, our forces, under the cover of artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on enemy positions.

### British Prime Minister Announces in the House of Commons: Britain and the Soviet Union Conclude Alliance

Says This Move Will Greatly Benefit the War Situation

Urges That Soviet-Polish Compromise Be Realized

Reuters, London, 15th – Prime Minister Churchill made a statement in the House of Commons today, formally announcing the conclusion of an alliance between Britain and the Soviet Union. Before making this statement, the Prime Minister briefly addressed matters in the House, saying that he was quite concerned about the overseas impact of the recent production debates. Statements such as that Britain's industrial performance only reached 75 percent of standards, and the chaotic situation within the aircraft production department, were all enough to make the United States and the Dominions believe that we were mismanaging things and not putting forth our full effort. These remarks, no matter where they are transmitted, will cause serious damage, especially since this is only a one-sided account and cannot represent our great and well-managed efforts. It is regrettable that he was unable to participate in the debate from beginning to end due to many other matters. It should be known that the accusations made by the various cabinet members at that time could obviously not provide considered responses, which is distinctly different from debates during peacetime between the parties. He has carefully read the official report of the debate and has ordered that the more serious questions be sent to the relevant departments (cheers) so that they can be studied. He proposed that another day of open debate be held on various matters soon, and he himself will make a detailed statement on the entire issue to the extent permitted by the public interest. He hopes that this will dispel any impression of misunderstanding.

The Prime Minister continued to speak about the Soviet Union, saying, "It was not until the end of last week that the British and Soviet governments were able to conclude a solemn agreement, jointly undertaking to continue the war against Germany under Hitler's rule, providing mutual assistance to the greatest extent possible, and not making a separate peace. The signing of this agreement and the announcement of its contents are of great benefit and potential for the future of the war. This agreement is naturally of an allied nature, and the Soviet people are now our allies." (Cheers) Foreign Secretary Eden is also strongly promoting the realization of a compromise between the Soviet Union and Poland. Although these negotiations have not yet reached completion, with General Sikorski presiding over the matter, there is hope that another important step will be taken soon.

The Prime Minister then expressed his satisfaction with the end of the Syrian war, saying that he had hoped to include the terms of the Syrian armistice agreement in this statement, but its final form had not yet been released, so he was unable to do so. Currently, some minor revisions have been agreed upon regarding the agreement, but the British government is completely satisfied with its outline. The Prime Minister finally responded to a question from a certain member regarding the debate on the Middle East, saying that he proposed to start the debate himself, and then anyone could ask questions publicly. Someone then asked if the Prime Minister would answer the questions himself, and the Prime Minister replied amidst laughter, "I will try my best to make the debate lively."

### Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Proceed Smoothly

Reuters, London, 15th – Official sources here state that since arriving in Britain, the Soviet mission has been in close contact with the British Chiefs of Staff and the Minister of Defence. General Golokov and Colonel Traagan have now returned to Moscow to report on everything and will return to London soon. At the same time, the mission, led by Admiral Karalimov, is currently working without any obstacles. The British government hosted a banquet for members of the Soviet mission at the Claridge's Hotel yesterday. British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander presided. In addition to members of the mission, other guests included Soviet Ambassador Maisky, Air Marshal Poutier, Admiral Pont, British Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Lieutenant General Bonar, and several representatives from the British armed forces.

### Britain Determined Not to Stop Fighting Until Nazi Regime is Eliminated

Will Expand Scope of Air Raids on Germany

Will Use Their Own Methods Against Them

Reuters, London, 15th – British Prime Minister Churchill said in a speech at a luncheon of the London City Council yesterday that British bombers will continue to bomb German cities and industries until the Nazi regime is destroyed by the British Air Force or overthrown by the Germans themselves. The resilience and courage shown by British ports and towns when they were repeatedly attacked by enemy aircraft are no less than those of London. We must now ask ourselves, will the air raids happen again? We have assumed that they will happen again, so months ago I asked the Home Secretary and the Minister of Health to make all kinds of preparations to prevent air raids as intense as before or even more intense than before in the autumn and winter. I know that things are now underway to increase this kind of preparedness. Air raid shelters have been strengthened and improved, with lighting and heating equipment. Fire lookouts have also been improved, and many new arrangements have been made. If air raids resume, London will be prepared to deal with them. If Londoners vote tonight on our conclusion of a public agreement to stop bombing cities, most people will surely shout "No!" We will use the German's methods against the Germans, and we will repay them double. (Cheers) Londoners will certainly unanimously say to Hitler, "You have done everything evil! You have been most rampant where resistance is weakest. You are the originator of indiscriminate bombing. We cannot forget Warsaw in the first few days of the war. The tragic massacre of the southern capital is still imprinted in our hearts. We also know deeply the barbaric attacks you are currently inflicting on the Soviet people. We sympathize with the Soviets' heroic struggle. (Cheers) We will have no truce or peace talks with you. You will exert your strength, and we will also exert our strength!" (Cheers) Now it is almost our turn to show our skills. We live in a terrible era in human history, but we are confident that it is just to return this to the enemy. Now is the time to make the Germans also taste in their own cities the pain that Germany has repeatedly inflicted on its neighbors and the world for decades. We have been intensifying our systematic and scientific bombing of German towns, ports, industries, and other military targets in the past month. We believe we have the ability to continue this bombing, more and more fiercely, month after month, year after year, until the Nazi regime is eliminated. (Cheers) The large bombers produced by our factories and flown across the Atlantic are increasing month by month. We will continue to pour large amounts of explosives on Germany, and Italy, which is called a country but is actually a German province, will not be spared. The bombs we have dropped on Germany in the past few weeks are about half of the total number dropped by the German side on Britain since the beginning of the war, but this is just the beginning. By this time next year, everyone's strength can be increased many times over. For this reason, I ask the people to be prepared to prevent the enemy from launching fierce counterattacks as early as possible. Our methods for dealing with German night raids have been greatly improved. German aircraft no longer consider flying close to the British coast a pleasant experience. If we say that German aircraft are busy with the Soviet Union, so they have not recently made night raids on Britain, then this statement is not correct, because Germany does indeed have a powerful bomber force in Western Europe that can launch fierce attacks. I don't know why they don't come, but it must not be because they love us. The organization, diligence, and dedication of our people must be brought to the highest level. We cannot expect to hit people without being hit back. We plan to strengthen our attacks on Germany day by day, so our people should prepare themselves to reinvigorate their efforts in the London war. Even if our future is very difficult, and even if our work is very difficult, our goals will never change, because we deeply know that after this difficult period, there will be a new freedom and glory for all mankind."

### Soviet Authorities Deny Moving Capital

United Press, Moscow, 15th – The German claim that the Soviet government and diplomatic corps are preparing to evacuate Moscow was denied by the authorities here yesterday.

### Spanish Blue Division Departs for Eastern Front

Havas, San Sebastián, Spain, 14th – Three units of the Spanish volunteer "Blue Division," each with three thousand officers and soldiers, crossed the border today into the occupied zone of France in order to transfer to Germany to assist in the fighting.

Reuters, Madrid, 15th – The commander of the Spanish "Blue Division," General Grande, accompanied by Chief of Staff Trocoso and four officers, flew to Berlin yesterday.

### Sixteen German Consuls En Route to Japan

Change to American Ship for Portugal

United Press, San Francisco, 15th – Sixteen German consuls canceled their plans to go to Japan yesterday under the orders of the German embassy in the United States. At a cost of $15,000, they chartered three American airmail planes and rushed to New York to board the American transport ship "West Point" to Lisbon.

### Armistice Agreement Established Between Britain and Syria

Coastal Strongholds All Under British Control

Axis Powers' Conspiracy Against the Near East Foiled

Reuters, Acre, 15th – The Syrian armistice agreement was formally signed by General Wilson and General Verdillac at 7:55 PM last night. The formal signing ceremony began yesterday morning. General Catroux, leader of the Free French forces, arrived first at 10:10 AM. Half an hour later, General Wilson and Lieutenant General de Larminat also arrived. No one except senior staff officers and official war correspondents was allowed into the Smith Barracks, where the meeting was held. Of course, eavesdropping was prohibited when the military leaders of both sides conducted the actual meeting. At 11:05 AM, General Verdillac of the Vichy side and his chief of staff arrived at the Smith Barracks in a silver-gray car. The guards at the gate raised their guns in salute. The Vichy representatives also included senior naval and air force officers, and Mr. Conti, advisor to General Dentz.

Reuters, London, 15th – A Reuters correspondent with the Allied forces in Syria reported that now that the Syrian armistice agreement has been signed, the key military positions, airfields, and fortifications protecting the coast from Turkey to the Libyan border are all under British control. This creates a strong barrier to obstruct the Axis powers' plot against the Near East. Furthermore, the occupation of Syria, an area of 60,000 square miles, has opened up a very important gap between Palestine and Turkey. Military sources say that the Allied forces in Syria could have launched a "blitzkrieg" and resolved the war in less than two sentences. However, in order to minimize material damage and, as far as possible, not to hinder the lives of the local people, the Allied forces adopted a strategy of cutting off the Vichy forces' supply lines. Therefore, the Syrian people (mostly Arabs) hardly suffered during the war. The entry of Allied forces into Syria cannot be regarded as aggression, but only a military occupation carried out due to strategic necessity. Now Syria is no longer in isolation but has become part of the sterling area, not subject to British blockade, and has restored its position in the economy of the entire Near East.

Agreement Contents

United Press, Vichy, 15th – A government spokesman declared upon the official announcement of the Anglo-French armistice agreement that France has not given up Syria or Lebanon, or the League of Nations mandates. Vichy also believes that the signing of the agreement shows that Vichy has defeated the de Gaulle faction, as General Catroux and the de Gaulle faction did not participate in the negotiations. It was also stated that this final agreement is very different from the British initial ultimatum. According to the spokesman, the terms of the armistice include: (1) Cessation of fighting at 9:01 PM on July 11; (2) Allied forces occupy Syria and Lebanon, while French forces will concentrate in locations designated by a joint committee; (3) Occupation will be implemented according to procedures, so that the occupying troops can immediately replace the French forces; (4) Locations of buried landmines should be pointed out to the occupying authorities; (5) French forces should be given all kinds of military honors. French forces will withdraw to pre-designated areas with weapons but will not retain ammunition; (6) Military supplies, including coastal artillery and anti-aircraft guns, will be handed over to British administration. British authorities have the right to use any military supplies they need; (7) Allied prisoners of war should be released immediately, including those who have been transferred to France; (8) French prisoners of war will be released after the occupation is completed; (9) Civil officials will remain in office when necessary for the continuation of administration until replaced by the British. After the replacement, they can return to their country at will; (10) When returning to their country, they should take French transport ships under British administration; (11) Public utilities and other public services should be handed over to the British in their original state.

### France Commemorates Democratic Day with Silence

Havas, Vichy, 14th – Although today is National Day, in accordance with Marshal Pétain's decree, the entire country and overseas territories will commemorate it in silence and without extravagance. At the same time, churches will hold memorial services for the soldiers who died in the two European wars.

Reuters, Damascus, 15th – Here yesterday, in accordance with the order of the Syrian government, we celebrated the French Democratic Day with a holiday. The authorities hosted a banquet for the officers and French expatriates stationed here. General Catroux, commander-in-chief of the Free French forces and representative to Syria, met with Syrian government officials and other dignitaries.

### Soviet Union Protects Far East Shipping, Declares "Dangerous" Areas

Zones Include the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan

Japan Values the Route of American Military Supplies to the Soviet Union

United Press, Tokyo, 15th – A Japanese government spokesman said today that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received information that the Soviet Union has declared the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk as "dangerous" areas to protect navigation to Vladivostok. Iwaiichi, representative of the Cabinet Information Bureau, and Deputy Spokesman Ishii, stated at the regular press conference on Tuesday that Lieutenant General Tatekawa, the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, has received this notification. Iwaiichi said that the establishment of the "dangerous area" is to protect ships sailing to Moscow from being attacked by the Germans. However, he also said, "We believe that German ships will not be found in the Sea of Japan or around Kamchatka." He believed that "this move by the Soviet Union is an unpleasant one," because the sea surface is close to Japan. However, he said that Japan has not protested this matter. When asked if Japan intends to abide by the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty, Iwaiichi replied, "The treaty still exists," refusing to comment on the future.

United Press, Tokyo, 15th – The Japan Times and the Kōchi Shinbun, which are considered semi-official organs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commented today that Japan values the route of American aid to the Soviet Union, not the amount of materials. The newspaper said that the promise of American aid to the Soviet Union against Germany must be realized when military supplies are shipped to the Soviet Union. What transportation line will be adopted at that time is worthy of speculation by the world. The newspaper continued to say that there are about four ways for the United States to supply the Soviet Union with goods: (1) Through the Pacific Ocean, passing through the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan; (2) The Arctic Ocean; (3) The Baltic Sea; (4) The Black Sea. Among them, routes 3 and 4 are currently impossible, so there are only the Pacific Ocean and the Arctic Ocean routes. However, among them, only the route passing through the Pacific Ocean to Vladivostok is actually usable.

Reuters, London, 15th – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the Germans have asked Japan to attack the coastal provinces and Siberia behind the Soviet Union. Although Japan is very willing to take advantage of the Soviet-German war to seize the benefits of the fisherman, it is still difficult to say whether it will act in accordance with German intentions. If Japan attacks the Soviet Union, a fierce battle will inevitably occur. The Soviet Union's Far East forces have not been weakened so far. The Red Army and Air Force stationed there are well-equipped and vigilant. Moreover, this kind of offensive, which focuses on land warfare, must be commanded by army generals. Although the powerful faction in the Japanese government also wants to take action, it does not want to transfer power to the extremists among the military again. This group of people, who seem to be in power at the moment, advocate that they would rather have the navy advance south to deal with Vietnam and Thailand.

### New Spanish Ambassador to Germany

Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 15th – It was officially announced last night that Minister of Public Security, Baron Mayat, has been appointed as the ambassador to Berlin. Mr. Ma was the founder of the Falangist Party and participated in the Spanish liberation war.

### U.S. Government Requests Appropriations to Expand Far East Bases

The Navy Department Still Advocates Fortifying Guam

Serving Personnel Need to Be Retained

(United Press, Washington, 15th) The U.S. government yesterday requested Congress to appropriate over 70 million dollars for the construction of Pacific naval bases. Among these, 5,570,000 is allocated for the naval air station project in Cavite (the military port of Manila), 18,605,000 for the new naval air station project at Barber's Point in Hawaii. It also requested Congress to allocate 300,000,000 dollars for coastal facilities, the main part of which includes 4,700,000 dollars each for the construction of submarine stations on Midway Island and Wake Island, 2,316,000 dollars for the construction of an ammunition depot at Oahu (Hawaii), 16,000,000 dollars for the expansion of underground oil storage at Pearl Harbor, and 6,850,000 dollars for the construction of a naval supply depot in that port.

(United Press, Washington, 15th) The executive authorities yesterday requested Congress to authorize an appropriation of over 70 million U.S. dollars for the Pacific coastal base expenditure plan from Alaska to China. It stated that the important frontier of the United States is still in the Pacific. The U.S. military requested authorization of 50,714,000 U.S. dollars for the Hawaiian area plan, of which 33,691,000 U.S. dollars is the budget for the main island of Hawaii. This total does not include the 2,975,000 U.S. dollars for the canal area under construction and the budget for some additional projects along the U.S. west coast, to demonstrate the determination to implement a massive program. The Navy Department also requested 5,000 U.S. dollars to construct a wireless radio station to replace the one currently used by the U.S. Marine Corps in Qinhuangdao, China. The Navy Department further requested authorization of 17,020,000 U.S. dollars to establish island "listening posts" around Johnston Island, Midway Island, Palmyra Island, and Wake Island in Hawaii, and 6,000,000 U.S. dollars to improve the naval air station on Samoa Island. The smaller budget request for Alaska is 9,533,000 U.S. dollars. The plan for Guam includes 170,000 U.S. dollars for living facilities at the naval station, 100,000 U.S. dollars for a naval hospital, and 60,000 U.S. dollars for staff quarters at the naval radio station, it is said.

(United Press, Washington, 15th) U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated yesterday that the Navy Department still advocates fortifying Guam. It is said that once the U.S. bases in the Pacific are built, they can cope with any emergency situation, but there are currently no plans to expand the bases. He also said that we believe Hawaii is already the strongest and most difficult-to-attack fortress in the world.

(United Press, Washington, 15th) President Roosevelt and Army Chief of Staff General Marshall told leaders of both parties in Congress at the White House yesterday that, according to intelligence gathered by the Navy and Army Departments, the United States must continue to retain enlisted army personnel for more than twelve months. Senate Majority Leader Barkley said that the Military Affairs Committees of both houses have decided to immediately begin hearings on retaining serving military personnel and lifting restrictions on sending troops outside the Western Hemisphere. However, it is understood that due to the increasing number of opponents, the government has had to temporarily abandon its plan to seek the legal authority to dispatch National Guard troops outside the Western Hemisphere. Black stated after the White House meeting that President Roosevelt had presented full (even surprising) information on the bill proposed by General Marshall. He also said that General Marshall's discussion of the situation was frank and detailed, but I cannot disclose it. The reasons he gave were very sufficient. He also said that although President Roosevelt encountered opposition from congressional leaders, he was very determined. He further stated that everything was discussed at the meeting, but we did not discuss the issue of concessions. Everyone knows what we are doing. We are just beginning to train an army, and the training is progressing. We cannot bear to destroy it immediately. When congressional leaders contradicted each other about what was said at the meeting, Leake stated that the lifting of restrictions on sending troops outside the Western Hemisphere was not discussed at the meeting, while House Speaker Rayburn said that it was mentioned at the meeting. It is believed that congressional leaders have received notice that President Roosevelt's attitude towards proceeding with this matter is very firm and may overcome congressional opposition, it is said.

(Reuters, Washington, 15th) After President Roosevelt conferred with congressional leaders yesterday, reliable sources say that the president and others have agreed that Congress should quickly find a way to extend the terms of conscripts and National Guard personnel beyond the original one year. A journalist heard from someone who attended the White House meeting that there would be no further consideration in the short term of the proposal to lift the ban on sending conscripts outside the Western Hemisphere, because such a proposal has encountered much opposition in Congress.

### Repealing the Neutrality Act to Restore Freedom of the Seas

Acting Senate President Issues Statement

McNair Claims the U.S. is Determined to Attack the Nazis

(Reuters, Washington, 15th) Democratic Senator Glass, who was recently elected Acting President of the Senate, stated that the Neutrality Act should be repealed immediately in order to restore freedom of the seas and show Hitler that we are not afraid of him at all. He also said that the repeal of this act would clear the way for American ships to transport goods to England. We are now at war and should take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that our materials are safely delivered to Britain.

(United Press, Milwaukee, 15th) U.S. Federal Security Administrator McNair said in a speech last night that the United States is now forced to engage in an attack on Hitlerism in an attempt to prevent the Nazi way of life from encroaching on the Western Hemisphere. He also said that the United States would not launch an American four, five, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero dollar defense program to deal with the Soviet Union, even if the Soviet Union expanded its territory to within thirty miles of American territory. But if the Nazi Party ever crossed the Bering Strait, the residents of Seattle would be unable to sleep peacefully.

### Australia Pays Attention to Air Defense

(Reuters, Sydney, 15th) Blackout drills and other air defense measures are being rapidly implemented here and in Melbourne. The authorities will soon hold a conference on civil defense matters.

### Axis Powers Suffer Serious Blow After Anglo-Soviet Agreement

Cooperation Between the Two Countries is Indeed a Wise Policy

Past Actions of the Soviet Union Should Be Understood

The "Dalu Bao" (Mainland News) newspaper commented on the Anglo-Soviet agreement on joint action in a recent article, recognizing this move by the two countries as indeed a wise policy. The translation is as follows: Britain and the Soviet Union formally concluded an agreement on Saturday and became allies. In the agreement, both parties stipulate mutual assistance and guarantee not to make peace separately. The British authorities must have undergone meticulous consideration during the negotiations, and the United States must have been informed in advance.

Common Interests, Sincere Cooperation

In the current stage of the situation, when discussing various international agreements that are easy to understand, people are generally inclined to hold ambiguous attitudes. However, in the current instance, we have no room to doubt the sincerity of both parties. Since Nazi Germany has become a deeply hated enemy of both parties, it is appropriate for the two countries to reconcile and yearn for mutual assistance.

Must Be Able to Comply with the Spirit of the Treaty

It truly shows us that the spirit of Britain and the Soviet Union in complying with treaties is superior to those of a few villainous people. The Soviet Union has annexed small countries in the Baltic Sea, as well as parts of Finland, Poland, and Romania, and has been criticized by world opinion. However, from the perspective of resisting Nazi aggression militarily, the Soviet Union has gained a better position than in its past history. The Soviet Union's position was very difficult when the European war broke out, and this needs to be acknowledged.

Britain and the Soviet Union Form a United Front

When the German-Soviet Pact was signed in the past, general public opinion was skeptical. Today, regarding the conclusion of this agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union, it can be hoped that this phenomenon will not occur. In the past, there was considerable suspicion between the governments of Britain and the Soviet Union, and this is an undeniable fact. However, Soviet personnel must deeply feel that the practical gains of the Anglo-Soviet agreement far exceed those of the German-Soviet Pact. It is not without effect on arousing Soviet morale, and it can give a great blow to the morale of the Nazis, as it explains to them that Britain and the Soviet Union have formed a united front. Hitler's conspiracy to weaken the unity of the two countries has now obviously failed. At the same time, this agreement can strengthen the Soviet Union's attitude towards Japan, allowing it to persuade the Japanese to remain loyal to the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact with sufficient reason.

Wise Policy to Confront the Axis

As generally expected, the Germans will never willingly wait for death and will certainly conspire to organize an anti-Bolshevik "Crusader" front in order to achieve their trick of disintegrating the Anglo-Soviet front. However, we firmly believe that the British government under Churchill's leadership will not be moved and will use effective methods to dispel the suspicions of the Soviets. In this rapidly changing situation, the Anglo-Soviet agreement is indeed a wise policy to strengthen the confrontation with the Axis powers.

Japanese Newspaper Urges Authorities to Be on Guard in the North

The Japanese "Dalu Xinbao" (Mainland News) newspaper of this city also commented on the Anglo-Soviet agreement yesterday, believing that the Soviet Union will not be incited by Britain and the United States to take sudden action, and that Britain and the United States may exert pressure on Japan through the Soviet Union. Therefore, the newspaper warned the Japanese authorities not to neglect their guard in the north. After signing the Anglo-Soviet agreement, the Soviet side expressed its willingness to adhere to the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact unswervingly. The newspaper expressed its trust in this point, but expressed doubts about the effectiveness of the Anglo-Soviet agreement, as such agreements are the same as those signed by Britain and France and Britain and Poland, and have very little practical significance.

### Telephone Workers' Strike Resolved Through Efforts of the Political Department

Electrical Workers Resume Work Today

Wages During the Strike Period Calculated at Fifty-Five Hours

The 1,700 workers of the electrical telephone department of the Shanghai Telephone Company have successively made requests to the company for wage increases and improved treatment due to the pressure of livelihood. More than 700 workers in the electrical department began to implement a go-slow strike on the 3rd of this month, which has lasted for more than ten days.

Strict Guard at Various Branches

About 1,000 telephone workers also intended to implement a go-slow strike from 8 a.m. the day before yesterday in response to the workers in the electrical department. Fortunately, the police authorities were informed in advance and dispatched a large number of armed detectives to strictly guard the entrances of the company's eight branch management offices on Mett Herst Road, Jiangxi Road, Fujian Road, Huishan Road, Bixun Road, Haining Road, Lusheng Road, and Balibridge Road, instructing the telephone workers gathered at the entrances of each office to enter and work. The workers all entered the company as usual.

Political Department Has Impartially Mediated

The Political Department of the Public Concession, considering that telephones are one of the public utilities, and that if the dispute were to expand, it would have a great impact on social order, immediately devised ways to conduct impartial mediation. After sending personnel to speak with both labor and management of the company once the day before yesterday, both parties expressed their acceptance of the authorities' mediation. In order to resolve the matter as soon as possible, the Political Department specially convened representatives of both labor and management at 2 p.m. yesterday to conduct impartial mediation. Management sent acting manager F. W. Phillips as its representative, while labor sent Wu Changfu, Xu Deliang, Tang Woyu, Cao Huizhong, and Huang Shufang as its representatives. Pan Lianbi and Gao Yangen of the Political Department mediated. As a result of the negotiations: (1) All electrical workers will resume work tomorrow (today); (2) The dismissed workers Chuan Hao and Xu Deliang will still be allowed to resume work; (3) Wages, allowances, and rice subsidies for the strike period will be calculated at fifty-five hours; (4) In the future, management shall not dismiss workers without good reason. Other details will be negotiated at a later date. Therefore, the labor unrest has been resolved, and all workers are to return to work at the company today.

### National Salvation Bonds First Principal Repayment

In order to encourage the people to concentrate financial resources for national salvation expenses, the National Government issued the National Salvation Bonds of the Republic of China in 1937, with a national currency value of 500 million yuan. The National Defense Supreme Council has approved the repayment of principal starting from August 31 of this year, to be fully repaid in thirty years, together with the fourth interest payment due. The Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications will handle the payments. The Ministry of Finance has allocated the required principal and interest from the national treasury revenue and deposited it into a special account at the Central Bank for payment. However, according to reporters from the Xin Sheng She (New Voice News Agency) who inquired with the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications yesterday, due to environmental circumstances, the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications will temporarily not handle this payment. All bondholders can entrust banks to collect from the Bank of China and Bank of Communications in Hong Kong and various domestic locations. It is said that the full amount will be paid in cash at once, and not in installments.

### "Shen Bao" Readers' Scholarship Fund Committee Member Candidates Confirmed

To Be Undertaken by Shen Siliang, Chen Qingshi, etc.

Donations from All Walks of Life Became More Enthusiastic Yesterday

Yesterday, the "Shen Bao" Readers' Scholarship Fund received over 500 yuan in donations, and the opinions expressed in the letters from the donating gentlemen were sincere and enthusiastic, which was very moving. The committee in charge of the scholarship fund has been jointly organized by four celebrities from the education sector and representatives from this newspaper. The details are as follows:

Readers' Donations Become More Enthusiastic

Those who generously donated to the scholarship fund yesterday were Kangji, a deposit book with the Central Asia Bank totaling 204 yuan; Mr. Tang Yiren, 100 yuan; Ms. Tang Wang Huizhen, 100 yuan; Mr. Chuan Jingyu, 40 yuan; Mr. Zhang Jun, 20 yuan; Mr. Pang Xingcun, 20 yuan; Yuye Amateur Advancement Association, 10 yuan; Mr. Yu Shentang, 10 yuan; Ms. Ying Qin Shuluan, 1 yuan; Ying Chun Gao and Chun Tong together, 1 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 526 yuan was received, which, together with the amount received in the previous three days excluding monthly donations, totaled 2,116 yuan and 2 jiao.

Women and Children Promote It Together

Ms. Qin hopes that women in the city will save a portion of their makeup and entertainment expenses and donate it to the scholarship fund to reduce youth dropping out of school and create useful talents. The Ying brothers hope that children in the city will save their candy money and donate it to the scholarship fund, which will not only help poor and disaster-stricken children but also benefit their health. Why not do it?

Hotel Waiter Sends Monthly Donations

Shen Fengbiao, a waiter at the Continental Hotel, sent in his monthly donation of 20 yuan for July yesterday and set the 5th of each month as the date for sending the monthly donation. He also said that the hotel industry has no fixed income and can only accumulate little by little to make donations. His intention is very commendable.

Specialized Teachers Strive to Assist

Lu Boya of Wuxi National Studies College expressed his extreme willingness to assist in this matter, but since he is a salaried employee, a one-time donation is beyond his means. He intends to donate 5 yuan of his salary monthly starting next month. Teachers are the most impoverished profession, and their monthly income is limited, and their lives are already difficult. Mr. Lu extends this consideration to others, which makes his colleagues feel infinitely grateful.

All Proceeds from Manuscripts Used to Help Students

Mr. Wang Guoying is willing to donate the remuneration he received last month for writing for the arts and entertainment section of this newspaper to the scholarship fund, saying that although the amount is small, it is enough to express my heart. He hopes that people in Shanghai can be like Mr. Lu and Mr. Wang. The accumulation of a large sum for the scholarship fund is not difficult.

Leaders in the Academic Community Generously Agree to Preside

Reporters yesterday briefly introduced the situation of the scholarship fund being handled in seven groups and the invitation of celebrities to preside over it. This newspaper then separately sought their consent yesterday. These include Mr. Shen Siliang, President of St. John's University; Mr. Chen Qingshi, Deputy Director of the Chinese Education Department of the Municipal Council; Ms. Nie Lingyu, Principal of the Municipal Council Girls' School; and Mr. Lu Gaoyi, General Manager of the World Book Company. This newspaper nominated Mr. Zhao Zongyu as its representative. We are extremely fortunate that these gentlemen have generously agreed to serve as members of the scholarship fund committee and preside over everything.

### American Mail Steamship Company Announces Sailing Schedule

The American Mail Steamship Company of this city has recently arranged a new sailing schedule as follows: Pacific route from Shanghai to the United States: (1) mid-August, (2) late August, (3) late September. Hong Kong-Manila route (including the World Class): (1) mid-August, (2) late August, (3) mid-September. According to the original sailing schedule, there is no ship sailing to the United States in mid-August.

### Japanese Ship "Naruto Maru" Sailed to Ningbo with Passengers Last Night

The Japanese ship "Naruto Maru" runs on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. Because the Japanese naval authorities did not issue a long-term navigation certificate, the ship has been running for two months, and the schedule has not yet been determined. On the 30th of last month, it returned to Shanghai from Ningbo and docked at the Laobaibo Wharf in Pudong. It was originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo again on the 4th of this month, but unexpectedly, it was temporarily blocked by the Japanese Navy. Exports were suspended on that day, and it was moved to mooring buoys 26 and 27 on the 10th, waiting for the navigation certificate from the Japanese naval authorities. It was finally issued yesterday, and the ship sailed to Ningbo at around 7 p.m. yesterday. It is reported that there were about seventy or eighty passengers, and cargo was not allowed.

### U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Curtis Appointed as Regiment Commander

To Fill the Vacancy Left by Lieutenant Colonel Wayne

The English-language "China Press" reports that Lieutenant Colonel Curtis of the 4th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai has been appointed as the regiment's administrative officer to succeed Lieutenant Colonel Wayne, who has been transferred back to his home country. Curtis arrived in Shanghai last autumn and served as the commander of the 2nd Battalion. In April of this year, he was transferred to be the regimental staff officer. Curtis graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1917 and then served in various locations on the east coast of the United States, on the U.S. ship "New York", and at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. From 1930 to 1931, Curtis served in the 25th and 26th Companies of the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai. He was later transferred to the flagship "Houston" of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet at the time. In 1932, he returned to the Marine Corps. The following year, he was transferred to the legal department of the U.S. Navy Department in Washington. In 1936, he served at the Marine Corps School in Virginia and the 2nd Battalion of the U.S. 5th Marine Regiment there. In 1940, he returned to the 4th Marine Regiment and served as an adjutant at the headquarters of the U.S. Marine Corps in Washington. In August, he was transferred to Shanghai to command the 2nd Battalion.

### Shanghai Democratic Nations' United Association Sends Telegram to General de Gaulle to Pay Respects

Congratulations on Struggling for Freedom and Glory

The day before yesterday was the French National Day. The Democratic Nations' United Association of this city sent a special telegram to General de Gaulle, the leader of Free France, to pay respects. The original telegram is as follows: "Today is your country's National Day. This association wishes to express its support for France's determination to be free and respectfully pay tribute to the French leader who is fighting gloriously against tyranny and his loyal comrades."

### Japanese Cargo Ship Sinks off Daikai Island

Met Big Storm During Voyage and Cannot be Saved

Crew Was Rescued By Myoko Maru and Has Arrived in Shanghai

At 3 a.m. on the 12th of this month, a cargo ship (shipowner Soichiro Matsumura) of the Japanese Toyo Asia Marine Transport Company, sailing between Moji and Shanghai, encountered a big storm 30 miles southwest of Daikai Island, and the situation was extremely critical. At that time, the Japanese ship Myoko Maru happened to be passing by the area. The crew of the ship reported to the captain, who saw through a telescope that the cargo ship was on the verge of desperation, so he immediately went to assist and took the six crew members of the ship to Myoko Maru. As for the cargo ship, it was impossible to rescue it due to the excessive storm, so it was allowed to sink. Myoko Maru arrived outside the Wusong Estuary on the 13th and then sailed into the Huangpu River and docked at the Pudong Wharf. The cargo ship's captain, Matsumura, went to the Japanese Consulate General to report the incident. All the rescued crew members are currently residing temporarily in the Jiangnan Hotel on Minhang Road.

### Englishman Returns to Shanghai and Talks About the Recent Situation in Qingdao

An Englishman from this city, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao a few days ago, talked about the recent situation in Qingdao. According to him, oranges and sugar are difficult to buy in Qingdao, and the food situation there is similar to that in Shanghai. Qingdao is currently like a barracks, and traces of the Japanese army can be found everywhere on the streets. The sound of daily morning drills can be heard incessantly, disturbing people's dreams. The shops opened by the Japanese in the area are everywhere, and most of the vendors in the market are also Japanese. Although there are various news reports from the Japanese side, foreigners in Qingdao do not believe them and rush to listen to the accurate news broadcasts by Shanghai news reporter Alcott every evening.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Strictly Orders the Suppression of Shanghai Merchants Stockpiling Grain

300,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive in Shanghai Within Half a Month

In order to thoroughly suppress grain prices, effectively suppress hoarding, and guarantee the legitimate operation of legitimate merchants, the National Government has repeatedly promulgated measures to suppress prices, and Chairman Chiang also issued a handwritten order to the Ministry of Social Affairs, the National Food Administration, the Fair Price Purchase and Sale Office, and other agencies, requiring them to strictly comply with these measures in order to gradually reduce prices in various places and relieve the suffering of the people.

Grain Prices in Various Places

Since the highest standing committee and the chairman have strictly rectified and maintained legitimate business, it has gradually returned to the right track. Reporters from the Xin Sheng She (New Voice News Agency) learned from relevant parties in this city yesterday that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the National Food Administration have promulgated and implemented the method of suppressing the hoarding of important daily necessities during special periods according to government orders. In accordance with the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of this method, various items for which hoarding is suppressed should be designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the suppression area and notified to the competent government offices to jointly implement the suppression matters. If a special management agency is established, the original agency will continue to preside over the handling. It has been learned that the areas for suppressing the hoarding of various food items have been discussed and decided by the ministry bureau and sent to various places for investigation and handling after checking the suppression of various food items.

List of Suppression Area Names

The following is a list of the restricted areas for various types of food items:

(1) Rice: all provinces and cities across the country; (2) Millet: all provinces and cities across the country; (3) Wheat: all provinces and cities across the country; (4) Flour: major cities in various provinces; (5) Sorghum: Chahar, Suiyuan, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and other provinces; (6) Corn: Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, and other provinces; (7) Beans: major cities in various provinces. It is learned that no merchant in this city may hoard any grain items such as rice, millet, wheat flour, and beans, otherwise, they will be severely punished according to the law. It was learned yesterday that the Municipal Council's

Second Batch of Foreign Rice

The total number transported to Shanghai has reached more than 100,000 bags. Various grocery and grain stores that had ordered from the authorities and transported them to Shanghai in succession also reached about 50,000 bags. The total number of foreign rice ordered from foreign producing areas by other rice stores and transported to Shanghai in the middle of this month has also reached about 150,000 bags. Therefore, the total amount of foreign rice transported to Shanghai in half a month has reached 300,000 bags. Therefore, the rice and grain reserves in this city are exceptionally abundant. As for foreign sales, they have suddenly decreased due to transportation difficulties. Because most of the rice sold by rice shops in this city is Municipal Council foreign rice and is directly ordered from the Lichiji Foreign Firm, the sales volume on the market has greatly decreased, and rice prices have fallen in succession.

### Countless Deceptive Tricks: Impersonating a Doctor to Collect Money

How Can Incense Ash and Yellow Talismans Cure Diseases?

Foolish Men and Women are Easily Deceived

Zhang Xiangfa, also known as Hu Kun, a native of Henan, is currently sixty years old. He was previously reported to the authorities for impersonating a doctor and deceiving patients. Zhang was sent to Special Court No. 1 and sentenced to eight months in prison. However, after Zhang was released upon completion of his sentence, he did not repent. He changed his name to Luo Xibai, also known as Old Man Xibai, and practiced medicine at No. 23 Dengxian Lane, No. 334 Baker Road. He also published advertisements in the newspapers, promoting himself as

someone who uses Buddhist methods to treat illnesses, specializing in treating all kinds of difficult and complicated diseases. A local woman, Gu Zhang, who lives at No. 57 Dexing Lane, Connaught Road (currently 26 years old), has been suffering from a severe stomach ailment recently. She saw a report that Old Man Xibai could cure all diseases, so she went to seek treatment on the 6th of this month and paid a registration fee of one yuan and forty cents. Old Man Xibai gave her a packet of incense ash and instructed her to take it home and boil it with three red dates and a little brown sugar, taking two doses a day, which would be effective. If she came to see him again for another dose, he would be able to cure her completely. On the 8th, she went again because it had not been effective. The old man led her into a small room and said that he needed to use Buddhist surgery, and that she needed to

burn fifteen scriptures every day, each costing one yuan, for seven consecutive days, totaling one hundred and five yuan, in order to recover completely. Because she did not have this large sum of money at the time, she requested a reduction. They finally agreed on eighty yuan, and she paid a deposit of twenty yuan first. The old man then drew a talisman on yellow paper with a red pen, burned it with fire, circled it around her abdomen several times, and then pierced the wall with a pedicure knife, asking her if it hurt. She replied that it hurt a little. Later, she discovered that there was a red mark the size of a soybean on the skin of her abdomen, but the illness did not improve after several days. She then realized that the old man was falsely claiming to treat illness,

defrauding her of money. According to information, Detective Tang Jian, Deputy Detective Ding Huaguo, and Detective Xu Zhengting of the New Gate Police Station instructed the woman to take the marked legal tender of sixty yuan to Luo Xibai, and also gave her ten packets of incense ash. The detectives then arrested Luo and confiscated 550 yuan of legal tender, along with the accountant, Fu Maolin, a native of Ningbo, and the tea server, Zhu Tianyi, a native of Suzhou, as well as various deceptive Buddhist practices, letters, and papers. They were all taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of Special Court No. 1. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the above situation and charged them with the crime of defrauding money

formally.

He said that the defendants falsely claimed to treat illnesses using Buddhist methods, deceiving patients of their money. The police had received three anonymous letters of accusation and requested an extension of the deadline. According to Gu Zhang's complaint of being defrauded, Judge Zhong questioned the defendants briefly and ordered that the tea server, Zhu Tianyi, be released on bail of 500 yuan. Luo and Fu were detained and their case was postponed for further investigation.

French and German exchanges were inactive. The rest remained unchanged. The dark market for British-American exchange rates was slightly weaker in the speculative flurry after opening in the morning. After 10:30 AM, the Japanese bank started to spew out again. Chinese banks such as China Banking Corporation and Continental Bank also supplied currency, leading to the US exchange rate returning to 5.3125 yuan, which was manageable. However, foreign banks' selling price remained 5.28125 yuan, hence the return to parity at noon. The beginning of the afternoon was extremely stable. Fifteen minutes before the end, the Netherlands suddenly spewed out more currency, and British banks such as HSBC also sold, causing the US dollar to return to parity with the previous day's price of 5.3125 yuan. The British exchange rate, however, tightened by 0.015625, calculated at three-point-two-three-four-three-seven-five. Trading was extremely active throughout the day.

Chinese merchants and speculators actively bought the July-August US dollar at 5.3125 yuan, and were immediately difficult to conclude deals. The market momentum was slightly tight, weakening to 5.28125 yuan, and the trend seemed stable for a long time. HSBC's listings saw British Parity rise with American, and the silver rate increased by 25, calculated as a slight 23.25%, still little change. Around 10:30 AM, the Japanese bank suddenly came to sell current US dollars again at 5.3125 yuan, and the foreign banks' intention to accept the offer faded. Chinese banks such as China Banking Corporation and Continental Bank also came to sell August contracts at 5.3125 yuan to speculators, but the foreign banks were unwilling to settle at the above price. Hence, the noon closing was still at 5.28125 yuan, and the British exchange rate also tightened to three-point-two-three-four-three-seven-five.

### Gold Market Firm

The red-hot dark market for gold yesterday saw small fluctuations, and the market momentum was firm. This was due to the tightening of foreign exchange and repeated buying from the Shanghai west gangs. However, there were negative rumors, such as the impending southward advance of Japan. Hence, although the price rebounded, it circled in the middle of the trading. After opening in the morning, gold shops initially sold, then followed by Yuan Yi, Decheng, Hengji, and Xianghe, who started absorbing the supply. Foreign exchange tightened, so the price rose from 6,530 yuan. In the afternoon, Tianyuan, Xiangxingyong, and Dafeng competed to enter the market, raising the price to 6,570 yuan. Li Tai sold aggressively. The market price had already started to rebound when suddenly it was heard that HSBC had again sold US exchange and that securities firms were selling. The market was small, with a surplus of only a few yuan, and finally saw an increase of 19 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 70,000-80,000 taels.

Finally, the price had to be 360 yuan higher, a 10 yuan increase. Ornamental gold was listed at 5 yuan, calculated at 715 yuan.

Futures Rose 19 Yuan

Since every bar (ten taels) in the morning was difficult to settle at US dollar 5.3125 for the August contract, morale was boosted. The market opened at 9:15 AM at 6,540 yuan, 14 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. It started low at 45 yuan. Hesheng and Deda came to sell, dropping back to 6,535 yuan. It was seen that Decheng, Hengji, Yi Yuan, Cheng Ji, and Xianghe repeatedly absorbed the supply, and the Shanghai west gangs constantly covered their short positions. The price stepped upwards. Around 10 o'clock, the price rose to 6,567 yuan, which was sold by gold shops and money changers. It was seen that the price fell back. When it was heard that the Japanese bank was again plugging in US dollars and the rumor of Japan's southward advance resurfaced, Shun Yuan, Cheng Ji, Xinfeng Yong, and Dafeng spewed out their contracts, dropping back more than 20 yuan to 6,540 yuan. Yi Yuan, Da Yan, and Chi Da bought. The price rose again at noon. The noon closing was 6,557 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 PM at 6,555 yuan, decided by dropping from 58 yuan to 53 yuan. Tianyuan, Dafeng, and Xiangxingyong came to buy, and the price was immediately raised to 6,570 yuan. Li Tai sold, calculated that the price fluctuated greatly around 6,560 yuan. Until the US dollar exchange rate loosened at 3:15 PM, Yi Da, Defu, Yi Yuan, and Shun Yuan raced to aggressively sell, and the price stepped down a surplus of yuan, dropping to 6,542 yuan. Xinfengyong bought. The market closed at 3:30 PM at 6,545 yuan, rising 19 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, calculated by settling the August US dollar at 5.3125 yuan, a press of 10 yuan.

### American Notes Dominate

Swap Relationship... Short Accounts Rush to Cover

Korean notes trended stable and the market price was flat. The evening market still remained at 1.61 yuan.

### Securities: Public Bonds Rose Sharply

After the drop the day before, the dark market for public bonds saw another sharp rise yesterday. Ding bond almost rose one yuan, bought by Xinfu, Lemao, Hongda, etc. for more than 1 million. Zhong Bing bond broke out of two yuan again. However, those who took advantage of the high price to get out were able to sell at good prices. The long side saw A go to B and B go to C. The cycle generated and transferred to each other. It is not yet known who will win. When the long side's lines of defense cannot be unified, they will ultimately be unable to break out of the circling situation. There was no excitement in the morning trading. The buying side did not have much strength. Xin Chang, Xie Kang, Rund, and Runli did not have much capacity. Ding Kang and Yi Tai supplied a lot, all of whom were getting out. Shun Tai also sold a considerable amount. The noon closing market price was slightly higher by 2-3 jiao. In the afternoon, Xinfu entered the A and C bond market for 400,000, Lemao entered C and Ding market for 300,000, and Hongda also entered Ding for 400,000.

London, 14th (Monday) - The listing market for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British merchant companies' stocks today remained flat and stagnant. Only the stock of the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China rose 1 shilling and 3 pence to £8 18s 9d. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Although Customer Sales are Sluggish, Yarn Prices Still Rise

The yarn market turned upwards, but actual trading remained sluggish. However, industry players mostly viewed it favorably, and the news of the Shenxin Cotton Mill from the previous day was purely false. Therefore, the long side's morale rebounded, and there were quite a few buyers. However, those outside the industry continued to short sell. Therefore, the long and short sides fiercely competed. 20-count Double Horse high price was 1,592 yuan, and the low price was 1,573 yuan. The initial trading in the afternoon was 1,580-something yuan, then it rose to 1,596 yuan. The final price was 1,591-92 yuan. The yarn market is now rebounding after a sharp rise, and it is possible that it will circle for a while due to the stagnation of customer sales. Today, 160 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 410 bales were shipped to Siam.

Double Horse opened in the morning with a strong momentum, and the buyers were all insiders. The first price was 1,573 yuan. There were many buyers at this price. Shortly after, it rose to 1,575 yuan, and then straight to 1,584-85 yuan. This price circled for quite a long time. Because the sales yard was stagnant, morale was ordinary. However, the platforms were tight. The amount absorbed by the long side was not released. At 11:30 AM, it rose to 1,592 yuan. Unexpectedly, the closing price of the exchange suddenly fell by more than 10 yuan to 20 yuan, and Double Horse fell by 10 yuan, dropping to 1,579 yuan. The closing price rebounded slightly to 1,584 yuan. The half-day trading volume was 5,110 bales. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 110, Tong Hang 5,000, totaling 5,110.

The situation of the Double Horse futures yarn market. The market opened firmly in the early morning because the price of foreign cotton rebounded sharply, and the exchange market and the price of gold were both good. Therefore, there were many new purchases and short covering, and each of the July and August contracts rose by 7.5 yuan to 12 yuan compared to the previous day. The September contract rose 14 yuan. The buyers were even more active after opening. The July contract rose to 1,441 yuan, the August contract to 1,460 yuan, and the September contract to 1,530 yuan. After entering the market, the customer sales were still too sluggish, and the long side engaged in profitable resales, so the price loosened from the high. The noon closing saw the July and August contracts still rise by 6 yuan, and the September contract rise by 8 yuan. 10,280 bales were traded. The trading in the latter market decreased slightly. The market momentum was firm in the near term and flat in the long term. As a result, the July contract rose 12 yuan compared to the previous day, the August contract rose 8.5 yuan, and the September contract rose 7 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 16,240 bales, a decrease of 7,930 bales compared to the previous day. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the entire day are recorded on the left (the prices are net trade prices).

### Transaction in Coarse Velvet Seen Only Busier

The current cotton market situation is slightly calm. This is because after the yarn market rebounded, factory demand was relatively sluggish, so morale was slightly flat. However, coarse velvet and cotton are unusually scarce and expensive, and the trend is still tight. Because foreign cotton has not loosened, those who hold the goods are unwilling to sell them cheaply, and most are taking a wait-and-see approach.

The New York cotton market is lively, firm, and expensive. Due to excessive rainfall and unfavorable cotton production, the public's desire to buy is strong. The closing price yesterday rose by 14 to 19 points compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to active short covering, then fell back due to exporters selling in Europe. The market situation finally rose again due to continuous purchases by Japanese merchants. As a result, the closing price rose by approximately 3 rupees each.

It is predicted that the market will open today with an increase of 2.75 rupees.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is firm and expensive, and the trading is enthusiastic. Because the prices of American and Indian cotton have risen repeatedly, and at the same time, the stocks in Shanghai are not large, the public's desire to buy is strong. In recent days, both the cotton merchants and foreign merchants have made large deals in Brazilian cotton.

### Textiles  Textile Trial Shipment to Ou

Shipping 1,500 Pieces to Southeast Asia

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market fluctuated, and sentiment was lackluster. However, there was strong demand from both the southern route and local streets. There were reports of a trial shipment by the Wenzhou group in the coming days. However, the initial shipment only contains existing stock, and new stock replenishment will have to wait. Prices for white cloth, both coarse and fine, as well as twill, remained consistently firm. Prices for bleached and dyed cloth for high-quality goods increased by about 50 cents. Lower quality remained steady. Local street transactions totaled over 500 pieces of various cloths. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian groups purchased two to three hundred pieces of coarse and fine cloth and bleached and dyed cloth. Northern route, Yantai, and other groups purchased over one hundred pieces of futures velvet and other goods. On the 16th, 835 pieces of textiles were shipped to Hong Kong, another 55 pieces were shipped to Singapore, and another 635 pieces were shipped to Siam (Thailand).

Eastern Cloth: Prices initially rose, then fell, eventually settling at a steady level. The leading white cloth, fine cloth from the factory, initially rose to 49.80 yuan in the morning. However, due to sluggish trading, the afternoon closing price returned to 49.20 yuan, showing no change from the previous day's price. Fine twill saw a slight price increase due to the new tax. The forward market price for Blue Double Fish brand opened at 43.45 yuan. Colored goods, serge, peaked at 1.62375 yuan but closed lower at 1.61375 yuan in the evening.

### Grains  Imported Rice Market Small

Yesterday, imported rice saw a further price decline of one to two yuan. This was due to continuous heavy arrivals, leading to thicker inventories. Moreover, the Shanghai Municipal Council had recently received 40,000 to 50,000 bags of imported rice after its previous small shipment was sold out, all of which had arrived and were awaiting sale. Demand from the ironworks was limited, and the market already showed signs of oversupply. As foreign merchants continued to offer their rice for sale, wholesale merchants dared not purchase freely. Therefore, both spot and futures rice prices fell uniformly after the market opened. Although the small price decrease in the central market attracted purchases from inland merchants and speculators, leading to an apparent rebound, the continued selling by speculators and small retail holders ultimately resulted in a weak market, with closing prices lower by one to two yuan compared to the previous day. Spot price for Yinghua small package rice once reached 147 yuan, while futures ranged from 151.20 yuan to 150.05 yuan. Second-grade Siamese rice ranged from 142.80 yuan to 142 yuan. Spot price for broken rice was as low as 108 yuan, while futures ranged from 111 to 112 yuan. Total transactions amounted to seven to eight hundred tons. Spot rice also decreased by one to two yuan. First-grade Saigon rice dropped from 130 yuan to 127 yuan, second-grade from 122 yuan, small package rice from 123 yuan to 121.50 yuan, then to 120 yuan, broken rice from 95.50 yuan, then to 89 yuan, 砑米 from 113 yuan, then to 108 yuan. Total daily transactions were 15,000 to 16,000 bags.

Imported rice continues to arrive. The Taikoo Company's "Taiyuan" steamer arrived yesterday evening (the 14th) from Hong Kong, carrying 10,000 bags of imported rice, which were the Shanghai Municipal Council's price-controlled rice. The ship is currently docked at Pudong and is scheduled to move to the company's wharf in the French Concession tomorrow morning for unloading.

Thick Japonica Rice: Continued limited arrivals led to sluggish sales. With the sellers' insistence, the market勉定, continuing at 142.5 yuan for fresh early and late rice from Nangang, declining to 139 yuan. Original packages of white Japonica rice from Wuxi were 135 yuan, and old Japonica rice was 132-133 yuan.

Glutinous Rice: Although the domestic glutinous rice source has become increasingly scarce due to seasonal factors, scattered demand exists for necessary applications, leading to continued fluctuations. Prices ranged from a high of 127 yuan, then down to 125 yuan. However, Hong Kong white glutinous rice was affected by imported rice and the poor performance of local glutinous rice processing, resulting in sluggish digestion of inventory. This prevented sellers from pushing prices higher, leading to a soft market. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened at 124 yuan, then declined to 120 yuan. Glutinous green beans did not open.

### Flour Market Unsettled

Yesterday, the flour market saw weak trading due to a lack of sustained sales to customers and limited absorption by 木街. Moreover, the market was affected by the continued decline in rice prices. Holders were willing to sell according to market prices. Golden Dragon flour initially opened at just 32.10 yuan but quickly rebounded to 32.45 yuan and 32.35 yuan, with a closing price of 32.30 yuan. Fort powder opened at 33 yuan to 33.10 yuan. Australian flour of the Flower Bird brand was priced at 33.70 yuan (including weight allowance). Other miscellaneous brands were also directly distributed to local streets in small quantities. Total transactions amounted to over 10,000 bags. The market remains small. Supply and demand for wheat remained quiet, with no real market activity.

### Oilseed Cakes  Speculation Remains Rampant

Bean Exports are Considerable

Edible Oil: The bullish trend continued, driven by persistently limited supply. Holders became increasingly determined to hoard, and speculators took the opportunity to become highly active, pushing prices up by another three to five yuan. General market transactions included 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 40 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 20 barrels of soybean oil, 60 barrels of Dasu soybean oil, 200 barrels of Pudong soybean oil, 100担 of Dayou factory soybean oil, and over 3,000 担 of clear oil (prices detailed in the market price section).

Oilseed Cakes: Yesterday, the market trend remained firm due to continued purchases by large clients such as yarn and flower merchants. Additionally, the Southeast Asian group's offloading activity has increased, boosting confidence. Prices rose by another 20 to 30 cents compared to the previous day. Transactions included 1,000 pieces of Dayou soybean cake and 6,000 pieces of Shengji soybean cake (spot) and 20,000 pieces (futures).

On the 16th, exports included 700 bags of soybeans to Xiamen, 2,847 bags to Hong Kong, 2,888 bags to Singapore, 1,240 pieces of oilseed cake to Hong Kong, 1,000 pieces to Singapore, and 2,000 pieces to Siam (Thailand).

### Coal  Coal Briquettes Loosening Openly and Secretly

—One Yuan Cheaper per Dan—

The price of coal briquettes has been stagnant for the past month, leading to open and secret loosening. Recently, a price cut by a certain factory triggered a response from other factories, leading to widespread price reductions. The open and secret prices have now converged. Yitai Hing, Nanyang, Guohua, and other companies' own vehicles are priced at 296 yuan per ton. Goods from smaller factories are 4-5 yuan cheaper. Retail prices at doorfront shops have also been reduced from 17 yuan to 16 yuan per 担, a reduction of one yuan. However, most coal briquettes on the market were already being sold at 16 yuan.

Spring and Autumn

### Launching the "Shen Bao Readers Scholarship" Campaign

— Editor

The fundraising campaign for the *Shen Bao* Readers Scholarship has been launched for only three or four days, and has already garnered widespread sympathy from society. We are deeply moved by the enthusiastic donations and encouraging letters from readers!

The most noteworthy event is a letter from Mr. Shen Fengbiao, a waiter at the Continental Hotel, offering to save 20 yuan each month to cover the food and tuition of disaster-stricken children until his job is terminated. We are truly grateful for Mr. Shen's enthusiastic support with his hard-earned money. The fundraising of scholarships is originally a very meaningful cultural movement, which depends not only on one or two powerful people, but also on the support of a broad social stratum, so that it can develop and last forever. Mr. Shen's promotion will undoubtedly inspire future generations to rise up.

In such a time and environment, economic life has been weighing on people for a long time, let alone spiritual life. Students who have gone through countless hardships, traveled thousands of miles, those whose relatives have become starving victims on the road, those who have no relatives to turn to, those who are wandering the streets eating weeds, but their hearts are still strong, and their goals and desire for knowledge have not been lost in the upheaval. They need bread, and even more spiritual food! All kinds of living expenses are soaring with the pockets of a few speculators: a big cake costs ten cents, a thin book costs two or three yuan, and specialized books cannot be handled without a hundred gold. Please think about it, a big cake is enough to maintain life, is studying hard a waste? It is our current responsibility to preserve this bit of energy for the nation and society. - Their inherited responsibility lies in the future! Please don't forget them!

The desire to learn in the midst of adversity is for the sake of objective and realistic needs. On the isolated island, we often see some wealthy children who have good cultivation conditions, but abandon their heavenly responsibility, indulge in joy and depravity, - without any spirit of hard work, but only determined to self-destruct! We can't help but sigh for it. On the other hand, there are many scholars who are tightening their stomachs and working hard, and some even have no opportunity for further study. They are wandering and waiting for the sympathy of enthusiastic people in the society.

Whose responsibility is this?

Since ancient times, it has been a great virtue to subsidize the lamp oil of poor scholars, so that they can work hard in the environment of 断虀劃粥, and if they achieve something, they will add a brilliant story to the giver and the recipient. This is an excellent traditional feudal morality, but it is given a new social significance today.

Romain Rolland said, "Only heroes receive the bread of hardship and trial." Cultivating people for society - making the seeds of hard study in the world flourish, not too utilitarianly, is also a great pleasure in life! In such a difficult life, people like Mr. Shen Fengbiao still generously reveal their true feelings, so that those who achieve the Way can get more help. Why not do it for other aspiring people?

We respectfully ask everyone to extend a warm hand of sympathy to cooperate!

### Problems at the Market

— Mang

Precarious Livelihoods of Seymour Road Market Vendors:  Can a New Market Be Built?

Law and Russia are products of fairness and human sentiment.

I saw a news item in the newspaper about the relocation of the Seymour Road Market.  Originally, the property belonged to the Sassoon tycoon, but Mr. Sassoon suddenly had a "brainwave" and wanted to "change the market property into a warehouse" — thus, this historic market, which sustains the lives of vendors, cannot exist under Mr. Sassoon's resolute attitude!

Perhaps this will trouble some housewives. But what is causing panic are these poor vendors. They live here and eat here, and undoubtedly, their livelihoods are solved here.  This time, limited to "closing the market on August 31st," in today's difficult times, the suffering of these vendors facing this major "disaster" is beyond the imagination of outsiders.

Thus, the last resort is for the lawyer to appeal to the court. However, according to reports, "vendors have no hope of winning," and "from a purely legal point of view," British law stipulates that landlords have the right to freely dispose of their property. The vendors' appeal to the law will inevitably be met with failure.

Speaking from a human perspective, since Mr. Sassoon is a multi-millionaire, he might as well buy vacant land to build a warehouse. Moreover, the market is not a "charitable organization." The rent and miscellaneous fees paid by the vendors every year are also a considerable income.  Considering the timing, what time is this? Everything is expensive, and livelihoods are dwindling. The vendors' rice bowls are about to be broken.

As for the "aftermath" problem, the Public Works Department revealed that the solution is to merge with the Racecourse Market. However, upon guessing, it is not very likely. First, the Racecourse Market is already full of vendors. Second, the public places in the lower society all have certain "territories." The Seymour Road vendors moving to the Racecourse Market seems to imply "grabbing territory" and will affect the business of the Racecourse vendors. Third, land is scarce, and since the Racecourse Market is already full of vendors, if the Seymour Road vendors move in, there may be problems with the rent and miscellaneous fees of the market.

Therefore, this solution still needs to be discussed.

The most "fortunate solution" is, of course, to build a new market. However, it is questionable whether the Public Works Department intends to cover this expense.

This issue, I hope everyone pays attention to it.

### Bus Fares Increase Again

— Cao Wenhai

The fares of the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company and the China General Omnibus Company actually increased again from the 14th. This time, the tram fare increased, "first class averaging from 6.37 cents per mile to 9.11 cents, and third class averaging from 4.87 cents per mile to 7.49 cents" (for example, the trolleybus from the Great World to Nanjing Road, previously sold for 7 cents, is now sold for 15 cents; to Sichuan Road Bridge, previously sold for 12 cents, is now sold for 20 cents). The reason they hold is that "the exchange rate continues to shrink, and due to the war abroad, the source of fuel is not easy, various expenses have increased sharply, and the company's investment should have reduced net profit;" The reason for the bus company: "Since the fare revision in December last year, various prices have risen sharply" and the issuance of subsidies to employees has led to a sharp increase in expenditure and difficulties in coping, so they requested to increase the fares."

Reduced income is naturally due to poor business and insufficient cost. Naturally, raising prices is a method. After the war, the "isolated island" developed grotesquely, and residents clustered in one corner. The authorities of the Concession once announced that the number of residents within the boundary has increased several times compared to before the war. The passengers of buses and trams are naturally very crowded, and the vehicles are not enough. The authorities of the two companies also know this situation.

However, since passengers support it, the company's income has decreased instead, repeatedly increasing fares. The burden on the citizens is indeed unbearable. May I ask how much benefit the company can actually get from each increase in fares? It is indeed a question. If we do not want to treat the root cause to increase net profit, and repeatedly raise prices due to the so-called reduced income, I am afraid that the fares of public transport will be more expensive than rickshaws in the future. At that time, the number of people taking the bus may not be as crowded as it is now.

"Mr. X, how is your shop doing?"

"Not bad, the rain has moistened it, and the old rice from the past few years has swelled up and become a bit heavier."

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Eleven   Midnight Song

"This semester looks hopeless!" Mei Bao sat in front of a small stove, fanning the charcoal in the stove with a palm fan, looking listlessly at the earthenware medicine pot placed on the stove, secretly thinking.

That's right, today is already October 20th! Hengshui County Middle School started on September 1st. Because of Begonia's illness, Mei Bao has been absent from school for almost two months.

For more than ten years, Begonia has indeed been hardworking enough. Although her physical strength has become much stronger than when she earned thousands of dollars on stage because of constant exercise, she is still somewhat inferior compared to the average farmer. Therefore, after working every day, she always seemed more tired than Zhang Xiaogouzi. At the same time, her tortuous and desolate life experience was like a large bluestone, pressing tightly on her heart all year round, making her feel that she rarely had happy days. When everything was quiet at night, her thoughts could no longer be calm, often disturbing her to the point of insomnia all night long. In addition, because she wanted to save money, she wore and ate very poorly, and slowly, without realizing it, she laid down the root of her illness.

In the autumn of this year, when Mei Bao wanted to pack her things and rush into the city before the start of school - she is now a sophomore in junior high school - Begonia suddenly fell ill. At first, it only seemed like malaria. As usual, she stubbornly refused to see a doctor or take medicine. When her illness worsened, and a doctor was finally called, her illness had turned into typhoid fever.

"Child, it doesn't matter. You should go to school!" He also knew that the start of school was approaching and did not want to hinder his beloved daughter's studies, so he repeatedly urged Mei Bao to go to the city. "I have Xiaogouzi to take care of me. Why keep you here?"

Of course, Mei Bao was reluctant to leave, so she repeatedly refused and stubbornly stayed for a few more days. Begonia was already delirious, so Mei Bao served him day and night in front of his bed, unknowingly spending forty or fifty days in the sickroom filled with the smell of medicine.

### "Air Bread"

— Yao Yao

On Xinzha Road in this city, there is a certain candy and biscuit factory. Inside, the machines are rumbling, and a large amount of bread and biscuits are produced every day. The aroma is sent out from the windows in waves. People passing by stop involuntarily and smell it for a while. Sometimes, when they happen to be hungry, their stomachs rumble, their index fingers twitch, and some people say that the people standing there are eating "air bread."

### Impressions of the Wave Vocal Society

— Wei

Last Sunday night, introduced by a friend, I visited a musical group—Wave.

As soon as I walked into the alley, I vaguely heard a majestic singing. In today’s isolated island, where everyone is singing soft, drowsy tunes like "A Flower on the Lapel," hearing another kind of singing by chance was naturally very exciting.

However, after entering the door, I gasped. It turned out to be a small classroom, filled with young men and women. They didn’t seem to feel the heat and stuffiness at all. They were just stretching their throats and singing, with sweat dripping on their faces.

"The Women Worker's Song," "No One Allowed to Pass," "The Motherland March," "Torch,"... This righteous singing and enthusiastic emotion enveloped the entire room. These are young people with thoughts and spirit.

When it was time to leave, I shook hands with Yin Chong, the musical leader of the society, and had a conversation with Zhang Chao, the general affairs officer:

"Please tell me something about Wave."

"It's very simple. Wave is organized by several amateur young people. We don't have a background boss, so naturally we don't have a lot of funds. Rent, handouts, ink, all expenses, in addition to the membership fees of four corners per month from the members, are automatically donated by enthusiasts. We gather once a week to adjust our tired spirits."

"Are the songs you sing all of the hard type?"

"Not necessarily. Sometimes we sing soft songs, but they are always meaningful songs. We don't hum those tunes about brothers and sisters."

"Are you going to hold a performance recently?"

"We have decided to hold a fundraising performance on September 6th. At that time, we will also invite music instructors such as Chen Gexin and Zhang Hao to help, and Miss Zhu Ming, who is famous in the art world for singing 'Heavenly Ethics Song,' has also agreed to make a guest appearance."

When I left, the majestic singing still lingered in my ears.

Hong Huijun, a rising star of the Kun Opera, is beautiful and talented in singing. Her voice is clear, sweet, and mellow, and her appearance is particularly beautiful and gorgeous. She is skilled in many Qingyi and Huashan plays, such as "Spring and Autumn Match" and "Cuiping Mountain," which are her masterpieces. She has been a mainstay of the Tianyunlou Grand Theater for many years. She has now been hired by the New World Grand Beijing Opera Troupe and will perform her masterpiece there starting tonight.

Chapter Twelve  Utter Helplessness Like Ning Wu

Although Liu Yin Ying entrusted the old monk to be quiet about the matter, he was very uneasy in his own heart. He looked up and stared blankly at the sky, silent, only stamping his feet and sighing. After a while, the fire was still raging, and the red light on the horizon was sometimes dim and sometimes strong, and many fire crows were dancing in the air. It was really a big fire, reflecting the windows red. Liu Yin Ying hesitated outside, but he heard Xu Jing shout from inside the room: "Where is my virtuous brother? Where is my virtuous brother?" Liu Yin Ying heard the sound and hurried into the room. Seeing Xu Jing sitting on the kang, he said, "What are you calling for, Jing Ge?" Xu Jing said, "Why has my virtuous brother been out for so long and not returned to the room? The red light reflected on the paper window, is there a big fire nearby?" As he spoke, he pointed to the paper window. Liu Yin Ying knew that this matter could not be hidden after all, so he sighed and replied, "That's right, there is a big fire outside. Just now, I was outside observing the direction of the fire, and it's most likely Ningwu Pass..." Liu Yin Ying hadn't finished speaking when Xu Jing jumped up from the kang and said, "Oh no! That's not good! Ningwu Pass has probably been captured by the bandits. How can General Zhou deal with it alone? Let's rush back immediately, even before dawn." Liu Yin Ying hurried over and pressed him down, then said, "Jing Ge, don't struggle recklessly. Your arm hasn't healed yet, and it might bleed again. I suspect that this fire means that Ningwu Pass has been lost. Even if you and I rush back at this moment, naked, without a single soldier, it will be of no use. If it's just the fire set by the bandits when they attacked the city, and General Zhou can still defend it, then we can rush there early tomorrow morning, and it will still be in time." Xu Jing said, "I hope General Zhou can hold it, and there will still be hope for rescue. Otherwise, by the time you and I rush there tomorrow, I'm afraid it will be too late. General Zhou once said to me that retreating from Daizhou to Ningwu Pass was a last resort. If Ningwu is lost, the general is unwilling to retreat any further and vows to coexist with this pass. General Zhou's loyalty and bravery are rare in the world. If those who guard the land could all be like this, how could the bandits be so rampant? We can't make contributions and kill enemies under the command of a good general. Isn't this the will of heaven? Uncle Wang Yongtai has already died in battle, Fan Cheng has also died, Wang Weiguo died in the line of duty, and I am injured to this point. Only Zhang Lie is by the general's side. The situation is too isolated, so naturally he can't defeat the rising crowd of bandits. This is the heaven's will regarding Ningwu, not a fault of war!" (116)

### Following "Tears Splashed on Flowers," Golden Star Will Film "Shanghai Nights"

— Bei Shi

Yu Ling, like Xia Yan, is a playwright who portrays the real society of Shanghai. His "Women's Apartment" and "Tears Splashed on Flowers" have been praised by a large audience on the stage. The former has already been made into a film by the United Film Company and released, and the film adaptation rights of the latter have also been purchased by Golden Star, starring Hu Feng, Xia Xia, Shen Min, and Shu Shi, and will soon be seen by audiences.

Now, following "Tears Splashed on Flowers," Golden Star will film another work by Yu Ling, "Shanghai Nights," which still exposes the real life of Shanghai. It has been performed on stage several times, and the evaluation is as high as "Tears Splashed on Flowers." Moreover, "Tears Splashed on Flowers" is a social tragedy with dancers as the warp and compradors as the weft, with the background only before the August 13th Incident, while "Shanghai Nights" is the social dynamics of Shanghai after the war, depicting mainland businessmen who have fled to Shanghai to seek refuge, and all kinds of life are very profound.

The formulaic love tragedies have been eliminated after the costume films, so "Shanghai Nights" and the like should be used as a basis for film screenwriters.

Brief News  (1) The China Summer Theater Society will hold the first performance of Cao Yu's famous work "Thunderstorm," directed by Zhou Chu, with a strong cast of actors. It is scheduled to be performed today at the Swatow Theater, stage director Shu Shi. (2) The filming of "Cherish the Time of Parting," produced by Guohua, starring Bai Yun and Zhou Manhua, has been completed and will be screened at the Jincheng Theater this month. "Cherish the Time of Parting" is an original work by Gu Mingdao, published by Chunming Bookstore, and will be published soon.

(22) Little Cuihua

Little Cuihua is a pure Hua Dan (female comic role), and her fame came earlier than that of Gou Huisheng. Her artistic skills are appreciated for their genuine skill, and there is no need to use charming looks to please the public. After Tian Guifeng and Lu Yushan, Little Cuihua is the best in the play "Drunkenness." She is originally from Shandong, surnamed Yu, named Lianquan. Her father once worked in the political world. Lianquan first entered the Mingshenghe Opera School at the age of nine, with the stage name Yu Shengqin, also known as Little Peony Flower, and was very much favored by the class leader Shuixianhua (Guo Jixiang). Later, Mingshenghe disbanded and she transferred to Fuliancheng, specializing in Huashan roles. By the age of fourteen, she had already begun to stand out. Her stilt skills are excellent, and no Dan role can surpass her. In recent years, due to indulging in addiction, her appearance has deteriorated greatly, but insiders and outsiders still praise her unanimously. She has a younger sister who is married to the well-known Xiaosheng Jin Zhongren.
